Footnotes
STARLITE WALKER sped to the lead at the start, held firm over pursuers around the turn, widened advantage under steady urging in the upper stretch then
held late under a driving finish. MR. EXTENSION chased inside then two wide around the turn, drifted out wider under right handed pressure in the upper
stretch, remained determined in pursuit of the winner and sustained a solid bid to the wire. HEY HOMBRE chased up close in early stages, continued in
close range three wide around the turn, weakened off the top pair in upper stretch but stayed on for a share. CIANGO raced off the pace three wide, was
ridden five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. COMPASS CAY lost path shortly after the start then chased inside around the turn, tipped
a path wider for the drive and lacked late response. OUR NOBLE ORTEGA stumbled badly at the start and failed to move into contention. RECKLESS
PLACE bolted around the turn, pulled up and walked off after the race.

ROYAL WAR settled off the pace outside, raced three to four wide around the turn, closed outside, seized command leaving the eighth pole and just
withstood the runner-up's late challenge. MAGICAL JAIME brushed with SKY BRIDGE at the start, raced well back inside, angled four wide turning for
home, surged widest and just missed. UNIMPEACHED chased the pace two wide, bid three wide between foes in midstretch but was outkicked. THE RED
MAN dueled two wide to midstretch and weakened. DRUM AND DRUMMER dueled along the rail to midstretch and tired. PRIDE AND PASSION saved
ground to no avail. G FRIDAY failed to menace while racing three wide. SKY BRIDGE brushed at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. THE
WILD FLYER hit the starting gate and trailed in the three path.

Footnotes
DOUBLE PLAY KING raced close up outside a trio of battling early leaders, moved in tandem with ROYAL HARRY to take over coming to the
five-sixteenths, shifted in a couple paths and pulled clear from the latter into the stretch, and scampered away late on the fence. ROYAL HARRY was widest
of the quintet and in range early, moved as a team with DOUBLE PLAY KING bidding for command after a half-mile, could not match strides once
straightened away for the drive, and settled for second best. JAZLA vied early inside rivals, steadied slightly unable to stay with DOUBLE PLAY KING and
ROYAL HARRY after a half, regrouped somewhat and ran on to reclaim third inside URANIUM late. URANIUM vied early outside rivals, moved outward
after getting left behind approaching the stretch, and was outfinished for the show spot. GRIDDLES argued the early pace between horses, and was
finished midway on the turn.

Footnotes
LAST LEAF was ridden along the inside around the turn, tipped two to three wide approaching the head of the lane, gained closer contention then angled to
the rail a furlong out, finished gamely and got up in time. AMERICAN STARLET tracked up close in the early going then moved up two wide to engage
CREATIVE GIRL for the lead mid-way around the turn, dueled gamely into the final furlong, briefly shook free to a slim lead then got denied when the winner
surged late along the rail. FAWNING raced midpack along the inside into the turn, tipped out three wide leaving the quarter pole and sustained a solid four
wide bid through the lane. CREATIVE GIRL vied in opening strides then cleared on top, took on the challenge from AMERICAN STARLET mid-way around
the turn, dueled into the final furlong then yielded in final stages. POIEMA took a solid bump with ARTOS at the start, raced two to three wide in range
around the turn, came four wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. COMEDIC was never too far back and three wide around the turn, was
ridden along five wide into the upper stretch and failed to move on. CARDIO PRINCESS (JPN) raced in the two path late on the turn, tipped wider into the
drive and lacked the needed response for impact. DAZZY saved ground throughout and failed to move into close contention. ARTOS (IRE) took a solid
bump out of the gate, raced two wide in the last flight and never threatened. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE, FRACTIONS AND
FINAL TIME CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
MY CRAZY NEIGHBOR settled off the early pace outside, remained in range three wide around the turn, steadily gained outside and was up and clear late.
BLINDING LIGHT sped to the front, set the pace in the two path and led until deep stretch. BOURBON READY was soundly bumped at the start then again
not long after, advanced two wide around the turn and had a slight stretch gain while never committing to any of the available open paths. WIN NO JOKE
stalked the pace in the three path, had aim in upper stretch but was one-paced through the lane. ACAMAR came in and bumped BOURBON READY twice
early, saved ground off the pace and played no further factor. AWAY FROM HOME was outrun inside. R ADMIRAL had brief speed two wide.

BIG INVASION tracked outside early, ranged up to challenge for command outside LUCCI coming off the turn, took over through midstretch and kicked
away under a mild drive. LUCCI sped clear early and moved inside, fought back when hooked by BIG INVASION turning for home, proved no match leaving
the eighth-pole and ran on best of the others. BRIT'S CANDYMAN gave chase two to three wide to the top of the stretch, and went clear late for the show.
TRIKITRAKI bumped with BUENO BUENO shortly after the start, saved ground outsprinted for three furlongs, moved out for the drive and posed no threat.
BUENO BUENO bumped with TRIKITRAKI soon after the start, was hemmed in on the fence behind the pacesetter through the turn, stayed inside and
faded. BARONE CESCO raced two wide on the turn, and could not keep pace through the lane on the far outside. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED,

Footnotes
RACE CRAFT raced three wide around the first turn and settled nicely while rated up the backstretch, prompted with three furlongs left to run, loomed up
three to four wide late on the far turn, took over the lead at the head of the lane and finished going away. EXPONENTIAL was allowed to settle off the early
pace, circled up closer four to paths wide late on the far turn, sustained a steady bid for RACE CRAFT through the lane and cleared second best. MACK set
a pressured pace up the backstretch, held a slim lead over pursuers around the far turn, got collared by the winner at the head of the lane and weakened to
show. MONY applied pace pressure to MACK up the backstretch, was ridden two wide in close contention around the final turn then flattened in the upper
stretch. VELOCE was stubborn to load then away in good order and stalked three wide through early stages, sustained a bid around the final turn then gave
way in the lane. NAVAJO CREED settled and saved ground up the backstretch, shifted out four wide at the head of the lane and lacked a needed rally.
UNDEFILED raced in range along the inside, failed to progress under pressure around the far turn and steadily weakened in the stretch run. OCEAN RIDE
raced near the back, was ridden along three wide into the upper stretch and failed to rally. GENERAL was reserved in the back, urged inside around the
final turn and had no response. LARGE was keen tight two wide and forced to check sharply in the first turn, continued to tug along then settled near
midpack and came up empty around the final turn.

Footnotes
CELESTIAL CITY settled off the pace while racing three wide, went four wide around the far turn, fanned eight wide in upper stretch, closed outside, was up
inside the sixteenth pole and edged ahead. TAP THE GAVEL raced three wide in midpack around both turns, bid in midstretch, took over nearing the
sixteenth pole, was quickly confronted by the winner, resisted inside of that foe but was second best. TWIRLING BLUES pressed the pace two wide,
reached even terms near five-sixteenths marker, dueled past the eighth pole, was no match for the top two in the final sixteenth but stayed on well enough
to last for the show. ROADTRIPTONOWHERE hit the starting gate, advanced outside the first time through the stretch, tracked the pace three wide, bid in
upper stretch, was in tight between foes in midstretch, shifted out stayed on for a minor share. AMARILLO was bumped between foes at the start, saved
ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn and had a mild stretch rally between foes. NEVER CHANGE broke inwardly and steadied at the
start, raced well back two wide early, edged closer four wide around the far turn and improved position in the lane. HILARIOUS AFFAIR broke outwardly
and bumped AMARILLO into PIEER ROR, set the pace along the rail, drifted out through the stretch and tired. RIBBON FALLS was in range inside and
faded through the final furlong. CALLOWAY PEAK raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, five wide around the far turn, swung widest in the
stretch and never threatened. RALPHIE BOY failed to menace while racing two wide. DREAM OF A DAY was outrun while racing two and three wide.
PIEER ROR was bumped soon after the start, saved ground and made little impact. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
ADDED FRACTIONS AND CHANGED FINAL TIME UPON REVIEW.
