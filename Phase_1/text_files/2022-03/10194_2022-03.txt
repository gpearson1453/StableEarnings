LONDONDERRY trailed far behind, bid inside rivals in the stretch and rallied clear through the final furlong. SPECIAL RISK settled inside, angled out before
half a mile, continued gamely and gained late place. SOUTHERN CENTS alternated for the lead in the two path, bid clear briefly on the final turn then
weakened late. SUBSIDIARY vied along the inside to midstretch and faltered. FILLUPCOHENSAPIKER chased outside off the leaders, remained very wide
and flattened out. QUIET PLEASE was urged just off the pace between rivals and came up empty in the stretch. HOLA PRINCESS saved ground well off
the pace and gave way readily.

Footnotes
BEACH BANDIT stalked close up outside, tracked the dueling leaders, bid three wide on the turn, dueled, gained a short lead, then pulled away in the
stretch under urging. A GRAY FOR CAROLYN dueled inside for the lead, battled with CALLMETHEBREEZE for command, dueled inside rivals on the far
turn, dug in gamely in the lane and held for second. ENANO was outrun early, advanced on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly
outside. GO SKIPPY GO was outrun early, came three wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. ORACABESSA bobbled at the break, tracked on the
inside, then chased and faded. PREFONTAINE raced off the pace inside, angled out three wide to commence his run, then failed to rally.
CALLMETHEBREEZE dueled two wide for the lead, dueled between rivals on the turn and faded. FRED'S GONEFISHING raced three wide early, two wide
off the pace and gave way.

KAREN'S WAY dueled three wide, led at the quarter pole, drew away in the stretch and held on while tiring late. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT saved ground off
the pace, moved wide in the stretch and closed well too late. FAST INTENTIONS vied between rivals to the stretch and weakened slightly. REITERATE
dueled along the inside for half a mile and weakened. KNOCK OUT KID chased wide throughout and lacked a rally. OCEANO ROSSO broke in a complete
tangle tossing her head, rushed to contention then was outrun. HAY NINETEEN flashed speed wide down the backstretch and stopped on the turn.

LULA'S ROADRUNNER raced three wide off the pace, advanced at the quarter pole, rallied outside turning for home, closed steadily, ran past the leader
near the sixteenth marker and won going away. MS CANELA stalked the pace in the early stages, bid on the turn, quickly took over, kicked clear, dug in and
then yielded. WILD DELIGHT chased on the inside, chased on the turn, rallied mildly on the rail in the stretch run and bested the others. ET'S MOON
MAIDEN showed good early speed, opened up a clear lead, was no match when challenged on the turn and then weakened. CAUSE I SAID raced off the
pace inside, dropped back on the turn and did not factor. MAD MARY raced two wide off the pace, was asked on the turn and did not factor.

challenges, moved away again then continued gamely to the wire in a dead heat for the place. CENTRE COURT CHAMP stalked the pacesetter under a
rating hold then closed well to earn a dead heat for second. SEAMIALAUGH chased in the two path then inside, angled out in the stretch and flattened.
CHELSEA WALL dropped well behind outside, remained wide and was no threat. AKNA raced off the leaders four wide down the backstretch and faded.
