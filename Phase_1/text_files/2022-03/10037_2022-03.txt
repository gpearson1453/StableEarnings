BATTLE raced wide the entire trip and continued willingly while no factor. FULL SEND raced four wide in the second flight and lacked a rally. NAVY PIER

advanced into the stretch, rallied and just missed. WILL TAKE CONTROL dropped far behind inside then closed strongly through the lane too late. HORSE
BE WITH YOU was urged close up between rivals down the backstretch and continued well inside. DISTRACTANDATTACK raced within range wide
throughout and flattened out late. DRONE SWARM angled inside early, moved wide in the stretch and closed well. BUCKS ARE MOVING hustled just off
the leader inside, made a brief bid on the turn then faded. INDOCTRINATE saved ground early and weakened steadily. E T'S CANDY MAN raced off the
leaders and was never in contention. JOVIAL prompted the pace wide down the backstretch and was finished by the far turn. JOHNNY OIL trailed early and

Footnotes
FOREST FIRE chased wide, took over after half a mile then drew clear driving. MY TRAIN settled wide off the leaders and finished gamely outside. OFF
DUTY broke a step slowly, rushed to the front and continued willingly. JUMP SHOT raced close up between rivals to the stretch and flattened out.
SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS lacked speed and failed to respond. CATCH FIRE saved ground and lacked a rally. GLACIER EXPRESS broke sluggishly then
passed fading rivals. TY RAN A HOMER dropped back early and was never in contention. STARINTHEMAKING prompted the pace outside to the turn and
faltered. WHAT R U DOING NOW trailed early and was never a factor. DR. GRUNSEICH lacked speed racing wide and was no factor. OUT OF LINE
stopped abruptly losing contact with his field.

KISSES FOR EMILY bumped early, trailed to the three eighths pole, advanced on the rail on the turn, angled out in the stretch and surged catching the
leader in the final sixteenth. STARSHIP LAOBAN engaged in a taxing duel, shook off that challenge and edged clear in midstretch then was caught late in a
game effort. DISCO EBO hustled inside dueling with a narrow lead, lost the advantage at the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. PERFECT
DIRECTION bumped early, pursued the dueling pacesetters then lacked a rally. MARTINI'S AMICA saved ground well behind and was never in contention.

Footnotes
ICY DUDE saved ground throughout, bid to the front in midstretch and pulled away in a moderate drive. COMMISSIONER G settled outside, bid four wide
on the final turn and continued well. FAST BOB dropped far behind near the inside and closed well too late. IT'S GAME TIME was urged to the front inside
to the stretch and weakened. THIS ILL DEFEND was in tight behind rivals into the first turn, moved very wide into the lane. KOAN prompted the leaders
inside and the two path and proved empty in the lane. GENGHIS prompted the pace outside for five furlongs and faltered. SPRING EMPEROR dropped
back in the two path and lacked a rally. OPEN LENGTHS moved five wide into the first turn then faded.
