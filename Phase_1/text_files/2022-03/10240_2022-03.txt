stages. DOM THE BOMB set the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, clung to the lead near the eighth pole but faltered inside the eighth pole and
was no match for the winner in the final stages. WINGING WAYS chased the pace along the inside, stayed near the rail into the lane and weakened late in
the stretch run. MORETHANSOULTITLE was a bit slow at the start, chased the early pace, loomed large nearing the quarter pole, was in the four path into
the lane and faded late in the stretch. MR. ELEVENTH HOUR was done early. ONWARD trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
FIREMAN DAN tracked dueling leaders along the turn, made a bid three wide entering the lane, drove past the leader near the eighth pole and drew off late
under a brisk drive. TROPIC STORM vied for the lead early on three wide, dueled with foe while two wide along the turn, was in the four path into the lane,
overtaken near the eighth pole and no match for the winner. THISPOINTINTIME was fractious in the gate during the pre-start, trailed the field early on, was
in the five path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. TIGERITO chased the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and flattened out late in the
stretch drive. BETTER DASHER was in the seven path into the lane while no threat. BAYOU SHACK vied for the lead early from between horses, dueled
from the inside of foe along the turn, was off the rail into the lane and gave way down the lane. GREAT AWAKENING was never involved. HIT THE GAVEL
was antsy in the gate, had early speed then folded up.

Footnotes
PERFECT PAINTING was allowed to settle on the outside into the first turn, tucked in to save ground on the backstretch, worked his way through traffic into
the lane, shifted to the outside nearing the sixteenth marker, quickened once uncovered and was up in the final strides. ROUSING SIREN settled in hand,
ranged up four wide, came six wide to make a bold bid, fought on but was turned away in the last jump. SCAT SHACK attended the pace along the inside,
was bottled up leaving the second turn, was blocked from the three-sixteenths to the sixteenth pole, found a seam between horses and kept on willingly.
CANDY CURL disputed the pace along the inside, fought on through a long drive but grudgingly gave in late. MYSTIC KAT broke slow, was allowed to
settle, moved up along the inside, offered a mild bid leaving the second turn, but flattened in the drive. WAR NOVEL vied for the lead on the outside through
the second turn and tired. KANITHAPPEN tracked off of the inside to the stretch and caved. G FOR GERRY was allowed to settle and lacked a response
when called upon. RIVER STONES was never a factor. COCHISE saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
CAN'T HIDE FROM ME settled in hand saving ground, moved up through the second turn, got through along the inside entering the stretch, shifted out and
reeled in the leader inside the furlong marker, opened clear and maintained a diminishing advantage. DIRECT APPROACH was unhurried into stride, made
a sweeping move six wide, kicked on well but was unable to bridge the gap. HE TAKES CHARGE was allowed to settle, ranged up four wide to make his
bid, but flattened between rivals and settled for the minor award. JOYFUL HEART disputed the pace along the inside through a cracking pace, opened clear
after a half, controlled the tempo to the final furlong and succumbed. HOPPED UP settled in hand off of the inside and failed to make headway.
MALIGATOR failed to respond. THE BOSS FACTOR contested a hot pace for a half, settled off of the leader through the second turn and stopped.

WHERETHEMONEYWENT was allowed to settle, circled six wide into the stretch, kicked on well but was unable to reach the winner. HELEN MAE'S SONG
vied between foes for the early lead, opened clear on the turn, disputed the issue to the stretch and gave in. STYLIN UPTOWN was away alertly, tracked
three deep, made her bid four wide entering the stretch, but lacked the needed late response. SEDUCTIVE (IRE) was allowed to settle toward the inside,
angled out entering the stretch and improved belatedly. CHLOES ANGEL was fractious in the gate, was forwardly placed through the turn and tired. LAWN
DART vied for the lead along the inside through the turn and tired. QUIET DAWN failed to respond. SUN DRESS was never a factor. DON'T MAKE ME
BEG was through after a half.

Footnotes
FORT LOWELL was away in good order, settled off of the pace toward the inside, shifted out and advanced between rivals, came four wide, wore down
ELEVEN CENTRAL and was fully extended to narrowly prevail. ELEVEN CENTRAL was away alertly, angled in to set the pace, was headed leaving the
turn, fought on doggedly, was wrapped up late and settled for the runner up spot. CALRISSIAN was allowed to settle, looped into the stretch five wide to
make a mild bid, but lacked the needed late response. RUBINSTEIN rushed up between horses to contest the pace, forged a narrow lead entering the
stretch, but weakened in the final furlong. SPUNS SON was allowed to settle, got through entering the stretch but failed to make headway. FRONTAL
ASSAULT rushed up four wide, but came up empty leaving the turn and faded. SMOOTH TALKING MAN broke slow and was never a factor. TRAPPED N
PARADISE failed to respond.

Footnotes
TIGHTWAD settled in hand, advanced between horses through the second turn, angled out entering the stretch, came to level terms nearing the furlong
marker and was fully extended to narrowly prevail. MADELYNS HEAT was allowed to settle, moved up in traffic, dropped to the inside, got through entering
the stretch, was surging late but just missed. VITAL SIGNS disputed the pace outside, forged a narrow lead entering the stretch, fought on but grudgingly
gave in. CODE CLEAR was allowed to settle, looped into the stretch six wide and was making up ground. ORDER OF THE DAY was allowed to settle,
moved up four wide to make a bold bid leaving the second turn, but flattened between rivals. AFTERMATH broke slow, was unhurried, finished with a
belated improvement, but failed to seriously threaten. CINDY'S STORM rushed to the lead along the inside, contested the issue through the second turn
and tired. SEA LANE was close up off of the inside, but came up empty on the second turn and dropped out. ADICCION saved ground to no avail.
