CRUSADER late. AWESOME CRUSADER raced in midpack two to three wide early, rallied outside the winner and was gradually gaining to the finish.

the turn, and faded through the drive. RAFF'S VENTURE was crowded a bit at the start between horses, raced three wide and did not factor. SUNSPOT
was finished early inside. RISK VS REWARD raced four wide, and tired after three furlongs.

Footnotes
CAGUA settled off the early pace and saved ground up the backstretch, remained patiently handled into the far turn, picked up the pace with a quarter mile
remaining, tipped out four wide approaching upper stretch, responded willingly when prompted, cleared command and finished wrapped up. AMAZIN
QUEEN raced two wide off the early pace, moved up closer four wide around the far turn, sustained a steady three wide bid into the stretch and got
out-finished by the winner. GOLDEN BOW sped to the lead soon after the start and set the pace up the backstretch, continued on top to the furlong marker
then got collared by the winner and weakened to show. MOUNT SINAI tracked the pace along the inside up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid
approaching upper stretch, got in a bit tight with a furlong left to run, shifted out wider and edged closer on show. NO NANNETTE NO raced two wide near
midpack through early stages, failed to progress under pressure around the turn and steadily weakened in the lane. DOLCE APRILE stalked the pacesetter
up the backstretch, chased two wide around the turn then faded in the lane.

ALLEY OOP JOHNNY set the pace along the rail, drifted out entering the lane, continued to drift and bumped POUND GREEN nearing the eighth pole, dug
in inside of that foe under mostly hand urging and held firm. POUND GREEN pressed the winner two wide, reached even terms near the quarter pole, was
floated out turning for home, was lightly bumped nearing the eighth pole, dueled outside to the wire and was unable to get past the winner. STEAK AND
CHEESE settled off the pace while racing two wide and had a mild rally to gain the show. CAMPEADOR saved ground off the pace, advanced inside around
the far turn, continued to gain through midstretch then flattened out. WICKED FINN saved ground to no avail. AL HILAL failed to menace while racing two
wide. THENORTHREMEMBERS stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. STANFORD (IRE) was outrun while racing three and four
wide. TRIPLE JEOPARDY was up close four wide and retreated three wide around the far turn. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF POUND GREEN
AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
CHROME REPUBLIC lagged well off the early pace, began to get in gear two wide on the far turn, rallied through an ample opening inside the leaders into
the stretch and drove clear through the late stages. SILVER SPUR vied outside MINE FOR PASSION for six furlongs, drifted out floating NEPOTISM out at
the top of the stretch, lost the advantage to CHROME REPUBLIC once straightened away, and ran on to hold second. NEPOTISM settled in good early
position off the battling pacesetters and well clear of the others, ranged up to challenge from outside midway on the far turn, got floated out to the five-path
by SILVER SPUR three-sixteenths out, and ran on evenly. MINE FOR PASSION argued the pace inside SILVER SPUR for six furlongs, and weakened into
the stretch. RIVES faded after a half-mile. REDJACK broke slowest, was taken out four wide on the first turn, and showed little at the rear.

Footnotes
RICOCHET led the way around the first turn and set the pace along the inside up the backstretch, dueled with DREAMING OF GERRY around the far turn,
held a slight edge with a furlong remaining, dug in gamely, edged ahead and held firm. DREAMING OF GERRY was forwardly placed around the first turn
then stalked the pacesetter two wide up the backstretch, dueled outside of RICHOCHET around the far turn, remained in striking distance in the final furlong
but could not get by game winner. TACKLE tracked the pace through early stages, moved up three wide to engage the top pair late on the far turn,
continued in close contention through the lane but lacked the needed surge to get by. THE GREAT OZ secured inside position around the first turn and
stalked the pace up the backstretch, was ridden along the inside around the final turn, shifted out five wide in the upper stretch and failed to kick on. TAKE A
CHANCE settled two to three wide off the second flight mid-way up the backstretch, was ridden along three to four wide into the upper stretch and lacked a
needed rally. SOUTH POINTE DRIVE was unhurried in the back, saved ground into the lane and failed to menace. MAJOR FRONTIER got bumped
between rivals at the start, raced off the pace, was ridden along four wide into the lane and had no response. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE

SWEET PEARL pressed the pace two wide, battled between foes through the stretch and was up on the wire. SHES ALL WOMAN stalked the pace three
wide, bid nearing the eighth pole, put a head in front near the sixteenth pole, battled outside of foes and just missed. SPROUT WINGS set the pace along
the rail, led to the sixteenth pole and was outfinished inside of foes. TIME TO TWO STEP failed to menace while racing two wide. GREY CHARLOTTE was
in range inside and lacked a closing bid. CANDY'S DREAM played no factor while racing three wide. PATRICK'S LASS pulled up entering the turn and was
vanned off.

Footnotes
TYSON contested the early pace inside ANTHRACITE, faced challenges from ALLEGORICAL and MY ROMEO LIMA after six furlongs as well, dug in while
staying on his left lead and turned them all away after a long drive. ALLEGORICAL was never far back, lodged a three-wide bid between horses on the far
turn, battled on through the lane and came up second best. ROADTRIPTONOWHERE bumped with RIDEWITHTHEDEVIL at the start, followed behind the
first flight within range for six furlongs, swung four wide at the top of the stretch, had aim outside the leaders but needed more. MY ROMEO LIMA advanced
to loom a threat four wide after six furlongs, then flattened out through the drive. RIDEWITHTHEDEVIL bumped with ROADTRIPTONOWHERE at the start,
raced three wide most of the way, and made no late headway. ANTHRACITE vied outside TYSON for six furlongs, and gave way approaching the stretch.
GREG'S HONOR stumbled at the start, and never got close. CURBSTONE was through early inside.

Footnotes
QUICK TEMPO quickly cleared on top and angled to the inside, held clear racing through the turn, roused for more two to three wide in the upper stretch,
responded, turned back bids and held clear under a driving finish. FORTIN HILL raced just off the second flight then launched a three to four wide bid
approaching the quarter pole, sustained a steady outside bid through the lane, gathered up some ground in closing strides and edged a rival for place.
WHERE PARADISE LAY was prompted to a forward position in opening stages, tracked the leader into the turn, given cue three wide approaching the top
of the lane, sustained a steady bid got edged out late for place. ROUGH ENTRY was forwardly placed tracking the early leader, launched a rail bid turning
for home, raced up close mid-stretch then flattened out in closing stages. CATCH THAT PARTY was hustled up for response out of the gate but lacked
speed, raced in the back four wide, tucked inside around the turn and dropped back. LUGAMO shifted out soon after the start, raced off the early pace, had
no response when called upon and retreated.

CANELITO settled off the runaway pacesetter while racing two wide, cruised up in hand around the far turn, took over approaching the head of the lane,
drew clear in upper stretch, stayed on the left lead and held clear under a drive. PROTONIC POWER raced well back inside, angled out in upper stretch,
closed outside and was up for second in the final strides. CASHIER CHECK rated off the pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, bid
outside of the winner turning for home but was outkicked and lost second late. SARAWAT chased the pace inside and lacked a rally. BIRDMAN RICHIE
played no factor while racing three wide. ETERNAL REST sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail and faltered nearing the lane.

Footnotes
BOARD CERTIFIED bumped lightly with CIANGO at the start, pressed the pace outside DUNNIGAN, poked a head in front from between horses after six
furlongs, faced challenges from MY BROTHER MIKE and MR MAC QUHAE through the stretch, and held firm for the decision. MR MAC QUHAE was
allowed to settle early, swung four wide rallying off the far turn, could not match strides outside the winner, and went clear for the runner-up spot. MY
BROTHER MIKE raced three wide within range early, bid in earnest just outside BOARD CERTIFIED after six furlongs, battled on to midstretch and was
outfinished. CATATUMBO bumped with GRAND SIR as they spotted the field a couple lengths at the break, raced well back for six furlongs, came four wide
into the lane and improved for a minor share. BOGGIEMIESTER was four wide early, and lacked the needed closing response. BLUTO'S CANDY raced
three wide early, moved inside through the far turn, and had no rally. DUNNIGAN set the pace inside for nearly six furlongs, and gave way. GRAND SIR
broke out into CATATUMBO and was off slowly, and never got close. CIANGO bumped lightly with BOARD CERTIFIED at the start, saved ground well
placed behind the early leaders, and came up empty after six furlongs. SHIRLEY'S SHERMAN saved ground early, and never reached contention. RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.
