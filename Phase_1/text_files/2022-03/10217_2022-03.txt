Footnotes
ORBIT MARS set the early pace then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, dueled to recover even terms two deep midway on the turn, ducked in
across the path of Valid Reason past the eighth pole, drew quickly clear from that point and held well under steady handling. DECREED gave chase through
the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail, eased slightly outward into the lane and dug in to take second later yards while gaining on the winner. VALID
REASON hustled to the lead inside nearing the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, was met at the rail midway on the turn, checked at the inside
flank of Orbit Mars leaving the eighth pole and flattened stride. MYGIDGETMARIE chased, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and ran evenly
through the lane. FESSIN UP chased, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. DUCHESS OF SHIRE gave chase outside and raced widest
on the turn. MY BEST GIRL gave chase then faded off the rail on the turn. After a Stewards inquiry and subsequent claim of foul against the rider of Orbit
Mars, lodged by the rider of Valid Reason, Orbit Mars was disqualified to third place for veering in across the path of Valid Reason leaving the eighth pole.

TOWERING CHANCE rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, closed ground from the half mile pole,
took the lead three wide approaching the quarter pole, drew clear midway on the far turn, was steadily handled to late yards then taken in hand nearing the
wire. HERCULES HARBOR raced off the rail on the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced two deep on the
far turn and came along for second later yards. THORN OF ROSE HILL raced well off the early pace saving ground, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole,
eased outward through the far turn, left the turn in the six path and came along for third later yards. OMEGA GOLD dropped back from a brief early lead to
stalk three wide on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, took another brief slim lead at the five sixteenths, was caught at the quarter
pole, rounded the turn near the rail then weakened. WEAVINTHEBLOCKS saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three
path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. JUST GETS BETTER raced with the early pace two deep while between horses, gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole then faded into the far turn. ISLAND CADGER set the pace inside from the five eighths pole, came under pressure leaving the three
eighths, was caught at the five sixteenths and faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
CORRELATE rounded the first turn in the two and three paths, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the four path
and steadily improved in the stretch to take the nod under the wire. GRECIAN ADMIRAL saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path, came in a path to make sharp contact with Banner Man mid-stretch, dueled to a slim brief lead from that point but
was nipped under the wire. BAYTOWN JAKESTER rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on
the far turn, was bumped off stride mid-stretch, gave up the lead past the sixteenth pole and flattened later yards. BANNER MAN settled off the rail on the
first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn, was bumped inward and into Baytown Jakester
mid-stretch and flattened stride. LIL TOUGHMAN rounded the first turn about the three path and raced well back leaving the turn, picked up the chase from
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, angled out leaving the turn and finished well to close the gap. EISELE rounded the opening turn
in the three path, left the turn outside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then flattened in the five path of the far turn. BUSHIDO'S WAY saved
ground off the pace on the first turn, gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, ran near the rail on the far turn and weakened. DAMISELA rounded the
first turn about the five path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but faded into the far turn.

SPANGLISH rated close off the rail the first turn, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, took the lead midway on the far turn and dueled clear later
yards. STRONG LIL KOKORO raced with the pace inside, dueled at even terms leaving the half mile pole, took the nod nearing the three eighths, was
caught midway on the far turn, raced close through the upper stretch, yielded later yards and just lasted in second. BRIGHT DAWN settled off the pace
about the four path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, dueled through the stretch for third and just missed
second. FROGGY THE GREMLIN raced off the pace about the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced evenly through the
stretch and was nipped from third under the wire. STORMIN ROCKET raced off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn at the rail and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. MASTER THIS saved ground the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole
then flattened at the rail on the far turn. LET'S GET PHYSICAL raced well off the pace about the three path the first turn and showed little response through
the backstretch. RIVER WARRIOR RVF tapered in and closed to a slim lead at the three quarter pole, was met and dueled at even terms from the half mile
pole, gave up the nod toward the three eighths then faded on the far turn.

COMBINATION rounded the opening turn about the three path, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and steadily progressed in the three path of the
far turn, drifted into the stretch but dug in for the lead mid-stretch and inched further ahead later yards. ODIE was hustled clear and rated the pace inside,
came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, kept the advantage at the rail on the far turn but was caught mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded later
yards. FU MAN SUE came through the first turn about the four path and raced well off the pace leaving the turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, eased
out leaving the far turn and came along for third later yards. FORT FORTITUDE raced well off the pace and off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little further. ONE MORE FACTOR stalked off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened the final furlong. COZZE CAT drifted and was steadied into the first turn and showed little
response through the backstretch. MY CANDY BIZ rounded the opening turn about the five path, raced outside leaving the turn and showed little response.

Footnotes
LECTRIC CHOKE rated close toward the inside, challenged at the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep nearing the quarter, drew clear midway
on the far turn and was kept alert to draw off. HE'S NOT CURLY raced four wide on the opening turn and ran with the pace through the front stretch, took
the nod into the backstretch and dueled from the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the lead at the rail approaching the quarter, dropped back midway on the
far turn and had to settle for second best. BROTHER SKYE settled off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail
on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. RIGHTEOUS RENEGADE rated close off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the
rail, drifted toward the head of the lane then flattened stride. FIND YOUR BOAZ settled off the rail early, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn in the four path but showed little more. CRAZY IDEA raced well back saving early ground, bid mildly to pass some rivals and raced in
the five path of the far turn. TIZEZZY was not a factor. GLAD MOON (GER) steadied leaving the gate and never factored. JACOB T raced with the pace
inside, gave up the nod into the backstretch and gave chase from that point, then faded into the far turn. ENVISION SUCCESS raced five wide early on then
faded through the backstretch.
