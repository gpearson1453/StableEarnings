Footnotes
ADMIRABLY behind the first flight off the inside, angled out to be four wide when challenging between horses turning for home, extended drive, proved best
in determined fashion. TOWN CHAMP in the second group outside the winner, floated out to be five wide when moving with that one to the fore turning for
home, vied past the furlong marker, outkicked in the late going while clear of the others. STURGILL broke back, moved up the inside to duel by midway up
the backstretch, narrowly showed the way through the turn while racing in the two path, headed nearing the furlong grounds, could not keep pace with the
top two the final furlong, comfortably saved the show. CARBON STRYKER lacked early foot, saved some ground turn, moved out a bit for the drive,
improved position by passing tiring rivals, no real threat. KING OF THE COURT off a step slow, three path into the turn, dropped to the inside by late in the
bend, lacked a closing kick. JACK VAN BERG broke on top, set or forced the pace in the three path for almost four furlongs, faltered in the drive. CAVE
RUN off a step slow, was always outrun while racing four out to five wide through the turn.

DIXIE STREET broke alertly, allowed the pace to go early, continued to stalk the first flight while saving ground out of the turn, moved up to challenge along
the inside past the furlong marker, dueled to the wire while remaining inside the winner, missed. EL VENUE broke out to bother FORT RIDGE, was
straightened and cleared early to show the way up the backstretch, continued to set the pace while in the two path turn, weakened the final furlong after
between confronted by the top two while between then, remained clear of the others. AMERICAIN JOEY settled off the pace and the inside, continued one
paced through the stretch in lacking a closing kick. TIME HEIST within striking distance outside, raced four out to five wide into the lane, also lacked a
closing response. KIERKEGAARD lacked speed outside, also was four out to five wide in the bend, made little impact when improving slightly through the
stretch. CHICORY BLUE failed to menace while racing toward the inside. FORT RIDGE bothered, off slowly, remained always back. HE'S SO ZAZZY off a

outkicked for the runner up position. REVENIO settled off the pace and the inside, in some traffic through the first turn, continued in mid pack through the
second bend, went one paced down the stretch in lacking a significant response. FOXY ACE settled off the pace while three wide in the first turn, continued
in the three path and also lacked a closing kick. A. K. SAFARI raced off the early pace and the inside, moved a bit closer in the four path through the second
turn, faltered in the drive. TIZ MCNAMARA last to leave, four wide through both turns while always outrun.

Footnotes
SALUTE THE FLAG settled off the pace while three wide, continued in that lane up the backstretch and through the final bend, set down when straightened
for home, kicked down the leader in the final strides in closing with good resolve. LADY COMMANDER chased the leader toward the inside, collared that
one in the two path late in the final turn, shook clear when straightened for home, held a sizable lead late, nailed in the final strides. QUALITY CHROME
within striking distance inside, continued to save ground second turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive, comfortably clear of the others. DANCE
IT off step slow, raced off the early pace while off the inside, in some traffic first turn, crept closer four wide turning for home, saw that progress stall in the
run to the wire to finish up evenly. SLEEPLESS DREAM broke alertly, was clear through the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch under
light restraint, offered little resistance to the runner up when confronted late in the final turn, gave way when headed. PRAY GLORIA devoid of early foot,
four wide exiting the final turn, failed to threaten in the drive. GOLDENA off slowly, remained always back.

Footnotes
MAZIE G broke alertly, alternated up front in the run up the backstretch, continued to duel through the turn, disposed of the other speed when straightened
for home, clear past the furlong marker, held the runner up safe in the late going under steady handling. WAR MUSIC within striking distance off the inside,
in some traffic when moving a bit closer late in the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker then was slowly getting to that rival late. SHE'S
HAMAZING lacked early foot, improved in the two path through the turn, closest to the winner with a furlong remaining, flattened out in the late going. JERI
DAWN in mid pack when she got out twice a furlong in bothering CANCAN SAREE, steadied, raced three wide through the turn and then went evenly
through the stretch. HALF SCOUT lacked early foot, two path exiting the turn, improved position a bit in the lane without posing a serious threat. ON A
SHOESTRING away in good order, dueled up front inside the winner, first to blink exiting the turn, continued to weaken down the lane. CHAI TEA off a step
slow, four then five wide late in the turn, improved position a bit while passing mostly tiring rivals. NAVAGATIONALBEACON forwardly placed while three
wide, tired in the drive. REBEL VISION off a step slow, remained back. CANCAN SAREE in mid pack well outside, bothered with five furlongs remaining, fell
back and did not threaten. SAILAWAY AND HIDE off slowly, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
MY BOSS LADY in the second flight off the inside, between horses turn, swung out to be five wide turning into the stretch, quickly got to the lead pack
nearing the furlong grounds, quickly kicked clear under steady handling. BEAUTY DAY broke back, moved up to a forward position in the run up the
backstretch, stalked three wide early turn, outside bid, held a narrow advantage with a furlong to run, proved no match for the winner the final sixteenth,
gamely held the place while under continued brisk energic handling. DENALI ROCKET dueled up front along the inside, continued to vie through upper
stretch, also proved no match for the winner, outfinished for the second spot. WARM BEAUTY off a step slow, angled out four wide late in the turn,
improved position with some belated interest. THETRUTHISTHETRUTH away in good order, dueled up front off the inside, was tiring when in tight a furlong
out, continued to weaken. LADY GUSTO in the second flight early while along the inside, began a steady retreat before a half.

ROAMING UNION stalked the issue up front off the inside, moved to the fore with a sudden move midway on the final turn, quickly clear into the lane,
extended advantage under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. MOROCCO off a step slow, void of speed, four wide into the lane, rallied to be clearly
second best, no threat to the winner. V. I. P. WHO settled off the pace while saving some ground through the first turn, two path through the second bend,
evenly through the stretch to finish up best of the rest. MOST SANDISFACTORY fell back to trail after the start, raced outside, four wide through the second
turn, improved position by passing tiring rivals, no real threat. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT in the second flight while between rivals, lacked a closing response
when set down for the drive. DAVID'S GEM sprinted clear to set the pace in the two path, offered zero resistance to the winner midway on the second turn,
continued to weaken through the lane. FREDONIAN fractious gate, was finished after half. BEAR ALLEY chased early, stopped after a half, jogged in.
