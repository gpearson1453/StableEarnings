Footnotes
SUPER D'ORO settled at the rear two wide, gained three wide around the far turn, took aim a clearing G'S STORM in upper stretch, ranged up entering the
final sixteenth, and edged an advantage late. G'S STORM vied along the inside early on, backed off to allow an outer foe to go on around the first turn,
shifted out and prompted that foe from the outside down the backstretch, re-bid at the quarter pole, cleared in upper stretch as SUPER D'ORO pursued, but
was worn down by that rival in the late stages. HE'S A PRINCE saved ground at the rear, tracked turning for home before getting outmoved by an outer foe
entering the lane, then shifted out in upper stretch and kept on for a minor share. MIDNIGHT RIVER tracked in the three path, then from between horses
around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with them entering the lane, and made little impact. HELLO HEARTBREAKER vied two wide before clearing
around the first turn, but was headed entering the lane, and weakened.

Footnotes
CANDY BARON stalked three to two wide, bid approaching the quarter pole, dueled outside of GENTLE GEORGE through upper stretch, led passing the
furlong pole cleared approaching the final sixteenth, and lasted from an outer rival late. DURITZ laid far back in the three path, trailed entering the lane,
swung to the six path in the final furlong while picking up stride, and produced a belated rally to miss reaching the leader late. GONNA GETCHA saved
ground off of the pace, rallied along the rail in hopes to bid in the final sixteenth, but flattened late. THE HEAT IS ON tracked in the three to four path, tipped
to the five path in upper stretch, but lacked the needed kick to bid before getting outkicked in the final furlong. CLIMB AND MAINTAIN stalked two wide,
chased from behind the leading pair from the two to three path around the turn, and finished up evenly. GENTLE GEORGE set the pace along the inside,
met the eventual winner's bid approaching the lane, dueled through upper stretch, got headed at the furlong grounds, then faltered between horses in the
final sixteenth. SPECIAL FORTUNE laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor. DIRT BIKE SLADE laid off of
the pace in the five to six path, and tired.

NORTHERN DYNASTY broke a beat slowly, raced far back along the inside, shifted outside of the leading trio in upper stretch with many lengths to find,
then rallied to reel in the leader at the wire. SARAHS HOME vied two wide, then from between horses entering the lane, drove clear of those foes inside the
final furlong, but was nailed at the wire. BIG TINY laid far back in the three to two path, and rallied between horses in the final furlong to reach show late.
DESTINY'S LOVE pressed the leading pair from the outside, bid entering the lane, but yielded leaving the furlong grounds. TEMUJIN LADY laid off of the
pace four to five wide, and tired. A ROZE AND WINE set the pace inside of a vying SARAHS HOME, then inside of a pair of foes approaching the lane, but

LIL' JIMMI SUE stalked three wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, led shortly after, held from bidding foes on either side through midstretch, but was
outkicked by an inner foe at the sixteenth pole, but came back when that foe hung to regain an advantage at the wire. LENA'S SHADOW settled far back in
the two path, moved between horses turning for home, bumped an inner foe approaching the lane while in tight quarters, sustained a rally to split rivals two
wide at the furlong grounds, led leaving the sixteenth pole, but failed to kick on, refused to reach the wire first, and got nailed. COLLEENS VISION laid
forwardly placed two wide and between horses, but checked behind the tiring leader at the five sixteenths pole, shifted to the four path in upper stretch,
rebid among foes at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an inner foe, then railed to reach place. SAYAAD AIN'T SO settled off of the pace five wide,
rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an inner foe, and leveled off. GOSPEL MOLLY broke slowly, tracked in midpack along the inside,
but was outkicked by outer foes entering the lane, then shifted off of the rail to surpass a tiring foe, and chased the leading quartet home. WOW WOW ITS
MAGIC stalked along the inside, slipped inside of the early pace setter at the five sixteenths pole to bid inside of the eventual winner turning for home, but
weakened at the furlong grounds. OUTWORKTHEOKIEGIRL failed to factor. STAR ISLAND KITTY tracked four wide, but was outkicked by an outer foe
entering the lane, and gave way. DIAMOND GAL never got involved. DEVINE CANDY showed the way with a clear margin in the two path into the turn, but
wilted between horses at the five sixteenths pole, took a mild bump from an outer foe inside the quarter pole, and stopped. THE RIDER OF COLLEENS
VISION CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF LIL'JIMMI SUE PASSING THE THE THREE FURLONG POLE, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS
DISSALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS

Footnotes
OUT RUN'M tracked two wide, shifted outside of the leading trio around the far turn, bid entering the lane, dueled thereafter, but shifted inwardly in the final
sixteenth, put foes in tight quarters in the process, and prevailed. OKLAHOMA HEAT vied two wide and between horses, then only inside of a pair of foes
approaching the backstretch after an inner foe rated back, got headed around the far turn, but sustained vying position inside of a trio of foes entering the
lane, regained an advantage in midstretch, led narrowly in the final sixteenth, but was eased up while drifting out and bumping an outer foe late, and got
nailed at the wire. PISSARRO'S MANDATE pressed four to three wide, vied between horses entering the lane, dueled thereafter, but was herded inwardly
by an outer foe in the final sixteenth, got bumped into an inner rival, and checked approaching the wire while getting outfinished. TAG ME pressed the pace
three to two wide and between horses, dueled among foes through upper stretch, but began to be bested by those rivals entering the final sixteenth, then
steadied when pinched between horses soon after. PLENTY OF CENTS stalked along the inside, then from the two to three path around the far turn, shifted
to the rail in upper stretch but lacked rail racing room, then altered course back out in search of clear sailing, but failed to bid. J BOB was outrun.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, AS WELL AS A RIDER'S OBJECTION OF PISSARRO'S MANDATE AGAINST OUT
RUN'M FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL SIXTEENTH, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
BRASSY FIRE vied two wide and between horses, then only inside of a pair of foes approaching the quarter pole after an inner foe yielded, then inched
away from those rivals through the final furlong. OCTAGON prompted the pace three wide and between horses, vied between a pair of rivals approaching
the lane, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart at the furlong grounds, and was second best. HANDSOME HUNTER broke a step slowly while
hopping a bit at the start, switched outside of rivals early on, moved to track five wide into the turn, ranged up to the leading pair at the quarter pole, but
flattened out approaching the final furlong. MR. SMOKEY made little impact. FORTYSLEW failed to factor. LA' HOPPER pressed four wide, but faded
between horses at the five sixteenths pole. KEETOOWAH THUNDER vied along the inside, but faded at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
IS VAIN chased two wide, tipped outside of the leaders in midstretch, and rallied to gain an advantage late. ULTRA SPECIAL tracked four wide, bid in
midstretch, vied entering the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an outer foe late. MR L B J stalked three wide, bid approaching midstretch while between
horses, led narrowly and briefly from an outer rival entering the final sixteenth, but was outkicked shortly after, and lost the place battle. SWAY BACK WHEN
tracked along the inside, but lacked rail racing room in upper stretch, shifted out at the furlong grounds, and moved up. UNBRIDLED GUY set the pace two
wide, then from between horses entering the lane, but yielded a sixteenth from home. OKIE CITY laid close up inside of the pace setter while a bit off of the
rail, vied turning for home, but tired entering the final sixteenth. TRUE GRIT was reluctant to load, then broke a step slowly, and failed to factor. GOSPEL
BANKER was outrun.
