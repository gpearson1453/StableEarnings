Footnotes
FLIRTATIOUS SMILE shuffled slightly into the first turn while inside, tracked the leaders in the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground into the far
turn, edged out into the two path entering the stretch, challenged when straightened for home, edged clear the in the final furlong under steady handling.
SHE'S HAMAZING lacked early foot toward the inside, moved out to be three wide when within striking distance into the far turn, came four wide into the
lane, drifted out a bit nearing the furlong grounds, could not keep pace with the winner late, clearly second best. COURTNEY FAY set the pace along the
inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, had little for the top two in the drive, comfortably held the show. WAR MUSIC stalked the pace from the outside,
crept a bit closer midway on the second turn, came up empty for the drive. ON A SHOESTRING broke alertly, settled off the pace in the two path, dropped
to the inside late in the final turn, had little left for the drive. HOLLYSROYALDEFENSE off a step slow then was bothered, raced well back off the pace after
steered toward the inside, continued to save ground into the far turn, not a serious threat in the drive. CANCAN SAREE fell back while four wide into the first
turn, continued in the three path, failed to menace while remaining in the three path. SOBER SUNDAY remained always back just off the inside. SATET four
wide into the first turn, dropped toward the inside, was always outrun.

Footnotes
KNIEVEL steered toward the inside to save some ground by late in the first time, inside through second turn, patient, rail bid turning for home, quickly clear,
one right handed use of the crop, not threatened the final furlong to win ridden out. BIG PETE prompted the leader from along the inside, challenged inside
the leader but off the rail late in the final turn, briefly vied between foes into the lane, proved no match for the winner in the run to the wire, lasted for the
place. NUGGET OF GRACE broke back when in a bit tight, continued to lag through the opening five furlongs just off the inside, improved inside of rivals
into the lane, getting to the runner up late. TIGER MOON four wide into and through the first turn, continued outside, four wide into the far bend, briefly was
in the three path midway on that turn, floated out to be four wide again into the stretch, lacked a closing kick. MO HEAT void of speed, raced back early,
moved closer in the five path turning into the lane, lost whip, failed to muster a closing kick. CATS GOTTA CHANCE broke in putting inner rivals in tight,
narrowly showed the way first turn, raced under stout restraint onto the backstretch, continued to set the pace into the far turn, weakened when headed
turning for home. HOOK 'EM JOHN pinched back at the start, void of speed, picked off some tiring rivals while never a serious threat. INDIA TIGER made
little impact while racing off the inside, three wide second turn, failed to muster a closing kick. OSIYO pressed the issue for a half three wide, tired in the
drive. GLASSATO prompted the pace just off the inside, gave way, trailed home.

Footnotes
A BROKEN BREEZE in the second flight through the first turn just off the inside, raced in the second flight and along the inside late backstretch, in tight then
steadied along the rail early far turn, moved back out into the two path late in that bend, split foes to challenge inside the furlong marker, edging clear.
CHAKRA away in good order, showed the way into the first turn, continued to set the pace up the backstretch and into the final turn, shrugged off a rival
upper stretch, offered little resistance to the winner late, held sway for the place. WEST SIDE GIRL off a step slow, lacked speed in the two path, saved
ground second turn, angled out a bit turning for home, roused, gaining for the place late. CATANIA in the second flight well off the inside, continued to race
three wide through the second bend, lacked a response through the stretch to finished up evenly. TEENAGE KICKS prompted the leader in the two path,
continued to race closest to that one the middle half, lodged a brief bid turning for home, drifted slightly then began to falter. SHABAM settled off the pace
well out in the strip, continued outside and was four wide again through the second turn, not a serious threat in the drive. LADY MCKENZIE in mid pack and
three wide through the first turn, two path second bend, failed to rally. LEA RO in mid pack the opening quarter, was finished before a half. OCELIA restless
in the gate, broke back and was always outrun.

Footnotes
CAN IMAGINE broke alertly, allowed the pace to go early, tracked that one through the turn, lost some ground to that one into the stretch, set down, kicked
that same rival down under firm handling. AMERICAN DUBAI asked a bit to set the early pace inside, continued to show the way through the turn, clear
approaching midstretch, gave ground grudgingly to the winner, clearly second best. ALEX'S STRIKE squeezed back at the start to be last away, raced in
the two path while remaining back through the turn, improved position a bit through traffic. DR. FORMAN broke in to tighten up ALEX'S STRIKE, forwardly
placed just off the inside, steadied in tight quarters into the turn, fell back, went evenly through the lane. HE'S MUNNIE within striking distance well wide,
floated out to be five wide into the stretch while between rivals, lacked a closing punch. PULL MY CHAIN in mid pack while racing outside, four out to six
wide turn, one paced through the stretch. MIAS MOONBEAM void of speed while racing outside, lacked a rally. SEEK N JUSTICE remained back while
racing just off the inside. AGAVE KID in the second flight while outside, got out a bit to be four wide into the lane, backed up through the stretch. LOVE
NEST broke back, was always outrun. SOUTHSIDE SWIG in mid pack while racing along the inside, stopped, fell far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
TALE OF TRUTH off a step slow, raced well back early, four out to five wide through the turn, finished with good energy to be up in time down the middle of
the strip. BRASKA lacked early foot outside, four wide through the turn, challenged between horses late, outkicked in the final strides.
UCANTMAKETHISTUFUP broke sharp, cleared to the inside in showing the way up the backstretch, continued to set the pace through the turn, shook clear
again by midstretch, led late, could not contain the top pair. MAMMOTH SPRING away in good order, chased the winner into the turn, moved closer to that
one by late in the bend, flattened out through the stretch. MY KINDA TETON within striking distance while between horses, in traffic late in the turn, went
evenly when clear for the drive. RIANTE SKY void of speed, raced through wide through the turn, improved position with some belated interest.
CONCOCTION broke in, settled in mid pack, raced three wide through the turn, lacked a response through the stretch. LOCHMOOR well off the pace while
racing well wide into the turn, dropped in a bit to be in the two path exiting, in traffic midstretch, no threat. PERIPATETIC in tight at the start, four wide into
the turn, faded in the run to the wire. MOONSHINE MAX forwardly placed along the inside, steadied a furlong in, continued to save ground through the turn,
backed up in the drive. DEGRAY forwardly placed early while racing three wide, staged a steady retreat. MUCHO ROCKET CAT in mid pack and in traffic
into the turn, gave way before a half, fell far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
CLANCY'S PISTOL settled off the pace toward the inside early, advanced in the three path to challenge turning for home, dueled into and through upper
stretch, edged away late under firm handling. MAGOO broke on top, set the pace along the inside, responded when challenged by the winner turning for
home, dueled upper stretch and past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to that one late, well clear of the others. SILENT DISCO bothered into the
first turn by a falling STEALTH FIGHTER, recovered to chase the runner up in the run up the backstretch, had little for that one or the runner up through the
stretch. BRODY'S STREAK bumped soundly by WINTERWOOD as that one was in turn slammed by the stricken STEALTH FIGHTER, raced back off the
pace and never menaced. WINTERWOOD slammed by STEALTH FIGHTER entering the first turn and was taken wide, fell back, no response drive, jogged
in late. STEALTH FIGHTER forwardly placed directly behind the runner up into the first turn, clipped heels, unseated rider, vanned off.

Footnotes
BLAME GEORGE close up in the run up the backstretch inside, fell back when in a bit tight into the turn, moved out to be three wide and advancing late in
the turn, dueled upper stretch, drew clear under firm handling the final sixteenth. TWICE THE PRICE in mid pack early while off the inside, advanced four
wide to challenge exiting the turn, dueled through upper stretch outside the winner, could not match strides with that one late, clearly second best.
WORTHTHEMONEY broke alertly, set the pace inside early, headed late backstretch, fell back into and through the turn, came back for the show while
never a threat to the top two. HARRY settled in mid pack while off the inside, three wide midway on the turn, lacked a significant closing response in the
drive. BRODY BOUCHER broke out, raced back off the pace and the inside, four wide late in the turn, improved only slightly with some mild late interest.
PRINCE OF EARL void of speed well out in the strip, four to five wide turn, also improved somewhat down the stretch without posing a serious threat.
SMOKEYMOUNTAINRAIN moved up to vie up front between rivals into the turn, faltered in the drive. MR FROST set or forced the issue up front while three
wide for four furlongs and also gave way when the real running began entering the stretch. WILDCAT HAGRID off slowly, trailed most of the way while out
in the strip to be always outrun. DEMURO finished early, trailed home well beaten.

Footnotes
DECISION MAKER last away, void of early foot along the inside, began a steady advance after a half, steered three wide when moving to the fore turning
for home, dueled past the furlong marker, proved best. TRUCULENT showed the way into the first turn off the rail, relinquished the advantage to an inner
rival onto the backstretch, pressed that one into the far turn, regained the lead late in the final turn while remaining in the two path, dueled past the furlong
marker and proved stubborn to the end. EGO fell well back to completely devoid of early speed, three wide into far turn, dropped inside through that bend
and displayed some belated interest to annex the show, no threat to the top two. INDIMAAJ crossed to the inside past the wire the first time, moved up
inside the early leader to take control onto the backstretch, set the pace the middle half then gave way turning for home. CATDADDY went one paced
throughout while racing three wide. EXULTING forwardly placed for three quarters, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
LIFE IS HARD forwardly placed through the first turn along the inside, continued to stalk toward the rail up the backstretch, shifted out to the three path into
the far turn, took over late in that bend, quickly clear, expanded advantage without being fully extended in a sharp effort. BEST BET closest to the early
leader well to that one's inside, inherited the advantage when that one began to cave before a half, showed the way into the far turn, offered little resistance
to the winner turning for home, no match, clear second. INVARIABLY bumped lightly with RUSSIAN ALPHABET at the start as that one bobbled, settled in
mid pack early off the inside, asked along and was four to five wide exiting the final turn, narrowly gained the show while not a threat to the top pair.
CRONUS void of early foot, was fanned five wide into the lane, mild interest while not having enough for the show. CENTURION lacked speed three wide in
the first turn, raced in the two path much of the second, roused and was three wide into the lane, improved slightly without posing a serious threat.
GREATHEART fell back after a quarter to race well back, in some traffic turning for home, bit tight between foes, went evenly when clear the final furlong.
TEO settled off the pace while saving ground in the first turf, three wide through the second bend, failed to respond in the drive. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW off
a step slow, was never a factor. RUSSIAN ALPHABET bobbled at the break to be off slow, moved up while rank and five wide first turn, continued well wide,
stopped while still five wide in the second turn, jogged in to be outdistanced.
