Footnotes
SKY OF DREAMS was well rated early, eased out and made a four wide move to take over leaving the five sixteenths, shifted down to be two wide entering
the drive and drew off to prove much the best under a drive. LOVELY EVER AFTER was well placed on the inside, eased out by the five sixteenths and
came four wide into the drive, proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. CIRCLE OF COURAGE pressed the pace three wide, then
dropped down to the inside nearing the quarter pole and weakened, bested rest. TAK E LADY set the pace on the inside, then was headed by the five
sixteenths, shifted out three wide by the quarter pole and gave way. LIGHTNING ROUND was five wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four to five wide
and tired.
