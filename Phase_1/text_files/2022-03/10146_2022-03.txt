Footnotes
NANA FANNY was up close inside, waited for room just off the leaders' heels around the far turn, got through inside in upper stretch, rallied along the rail
and was up late. VINTAGE GIRL stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes in upper stretch, took the lead near the eighth pole, edged ahead while
angling in leaving that marker, switched back to the left lead in deep stretch and led until the final strides. TAHAWEEL settled off the pace while racing two
wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, bid outside of foes in upper stretch and was outkicked. STUPENDOUS set the pace along the rail, was
collared in upper stretch, steadied off heels near the sixteenth pole and continued to fade. TORA LORA LORA prompted the pace two wide, vied two wide
around the far turn and tired in the drive. STRAIGHT TO GO failed to menace while racing three wide around the first turn and five wide around the far turn.
SHE IS ROYALTY played no factor while racing two wide. VICTOREM was outrun inside.

Footnotes
COZY CAFE was unhurried early, advanced turning for home in the two-path, rallied through an ample opening taking aim outside SHADILEE through
midstretch, and wore that rival down late. SHADILEE hustled through to get the lead after breaking a step slow, shook off QUEEN DOMINA after a half-mile,
settled into the stretch with a clear lead inside, but could not hold the winner safe while clearly second best. QUEEN DOMINA pressed SHADILEE from
outside for a half, got shaken off nearing the stretch, and stayed on to hold the show. LUNAR BLAST raced three to four wide throughout, and finished
evenly. K'S RUNNING FREE broke slowly and never became involved. FUTURE FLAY chased toward the inside for a half, then drifted out very wide tiring
past the quarter-pole, and jogged in.

Footnotes
NO NAY FRANKLIN (IRE) tracked in contention along the inside and saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide approaching the head of the lane and
headed in pursuit, stayed on determinedly and ran down rival in final strides. TRUE JEDI sped to the lead soon after the start and showed the way into the
upper stretch, held clear a furlong out then got caught by the winner in closing strides. PHILIPSBURG (IRE) hustled along three wide around the turn,
sustained a steady bid through the lane and cleared the rest. ATRAS slightly bobbled and brushed with rival at the start, chased four wide in range around
the turn then flattened in the lane. MILLENNIUM CONDO raced off the early pace, was ridden along five wide into the upper stretch and failed to rally.
HEAT'S ON ZAP was off slow at the start, chased two to three wide and failed to move into contention. SMOKIN BOW prompted the early pace and tired in
the drive. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

SHEZA SAVAGE broke sharply, stalked the pace three wide, took over nearing the sixteenth pole and drove clear. KENYA SUN set the pace in the two
path, drifted four wide into the stretch, led past the eighth pole, could not resist the winner but held clear of the rest. YEGUITA QUEEN came out and
bumped SCARLETT'S FLOWER at the start, raced off the pace outside, was trying to get out while racing in the four path around the turn then had a mild
rally outside. BAHAMIAN BEAUTY chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. LADY MECHANIC failed to menace while racing four wide.
SCARLETT'S FLOWER was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide, swung widest near the quarter pole and never threatened. BELLA SOFI
had brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
WINKIWINKI vied early outside SADIE BEAR and LOVIN MAKES CENTS, cleared off and moved inward to the two-path soon after entering the turn,
settled into the stretch in control, then was all out late while drifting out a bit. SADIE BEAR contested the early pace inside rivals, got outpaced by
WINKIWINKI through the run around the turn, was briefly boxed in behind the latter and inside LOVIN MAKES CENTS, found a seam and moved out with a
rebid in upper stretch, but did not have enough. PARISIAN VIBE broke inward, was taken off the rail in the second flight early, swung four wide approaching
the stretch, advanced through the furlong grounds but needed more. SOPHIA'S STORM was outrun early, and offered a mild response on the rail to get the
last major share. RITABOOK hopped at the break and was away two lengths slower than the rest, fanned six wide off the turn and passed tired horses.
LOLA LOCA moved inside early, and was always outrun. RIDE ON BEAUTY was slow into stride and never got close. CHITIENNE broke out into GAM
GAM JOANN, stayed in range for three-eighths of a mile, and shifted five wide tiring into the stretch. LOVIN MAKES CENTS vied early between horses,
steadied behind WINKIWINKI early on the turn, moved out and stayed on the chase to the stretch, and had nothing left. GAM GAM JOANN received a
bump from CHITIENNE at the break, raced four to five wide, and dropped far back after three furlongs.

VICTORY CRUSADE quickly cleared the lead and saved ground around the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch and held firm over pursuers
around the far turn, sustained steady response through the lane and held late under a driving finish. CAPSTONE GIRL tugged a bit while rated up close
along the rail, was patiently handled along the inside around the far turn, lacked a clear path a furlong out, tipped out in the final sixteenth, surged to the wire
and just missed. DIVINE EXCHANGE stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid near the quarter pole, sustained run into the lane
and secured a share. MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT was allowed to settle through early stages, roused four wide in the upper stretch, gained closer contention
then ran on evenly late. MAP EM UP was unhurried and saved ground up the backstretch, was ridden along the rail into the lane and lacked the needed
response for impact. FRANKIE'S GIRL raced in range two to three wide in early stages, hustled up three wide near the quarter pole, sustained bid into the
upper stretch then gave way. DANGER was not too far back while being rated through early stages, failed to progress under pressure around the far turn
and faded in the lane. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE

Footnotes
SKYWALKING settled off the pace while racing in three path, went four wide around the far turn, closed outside, seized command near the sixteenth pole
and won going away. SUPERPOSITION was in range five wide around the first turn and four wide around the far turn and stayed on to be a clear second
best. SWEENEY'S CAT tracked the pace four wide around the first turn and three wide around most of the far turn, angled to the rail nearing the quarter
pole and churned on inside to gain the show in the final strides. DOUBLE BLESSING raced off the pace six wide around the first turn, advanced five wide
around the far turn, took the lead and angled in nearing the five-sixteenths, drew clear in upper stretch then tired through the final sixteenth. MAYOR REMO
disputed the pace in the four path around the first turn, took a short early on the backstretch, vied outside of CLASSIC FILM down the backstretch, set the
pace off the rail around the far turn, was collared nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. ICY STORM stalked the pace three wide and faded
around the far turn. VALHALLA AIR BASE chased the pace inside and lacked a response. CLASSIC FILM led early, stopped after a half, was eased and
walked off.

Footnotes
MISS MIKAELA set the pace slightly off the rail, maintained a comfortable advantage turning for home, and was never seriously challenged while remaining
on her left lead. JOIN THE DOTS pursued MISS MAKAELA from outside, could not gain under pressure on the turn and into the stretch, and ran on best of
the others. VIVA LA RED was outrun two wide to the stretch, moved out and wore down BABY GUNDIN for the show. BABY GUNDIN saved ground on the
turn, could not muster a rally, and was outfinished for third. PRINCESS BETTY chased three wide early, and was empty after six furlongs. PUPPET
MASTER was finished early three wide.

WORA angled inside soon after the start, chased the top pair around the turn, shifted to outside entering the lane, gathered momentum under firm handling
and got a head up on the wire. TAPE TO TAPE cleared the lead soon after the start and vied inside of rival around the turn, cut the corner into the lane and
widened to a clear advantage, sustained steady response under firm handling through the lane and got caught on the wire. LAW OF THE LAND lacked
early speed and raced in the back, shifted out wide for the drive, forced to move out wider to get by drifting out rival mid-stretch and got up late to take show.
ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN hustled along in steady pursuit and raced off the top pair into the turn, came four wide into the upper stretch, shifted in to race two
wide a furlong out and got nailed for show. T. WALTZ raced off the early speed, was ridden along four wide around the turn, stayed outside into the lane and
lacked a needed rally. RUN LEA RUN saved ground into the lane and failed to move on. WONTOUGHSUNOFAGUN vied with TAPE TO TAPE around the
far turn, was no match in the upper stretch and faded while drifting out in the final furlong. RAYO COLORADO was ridden along the inside then came three
wide into the lane and failed to move into contention. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE
