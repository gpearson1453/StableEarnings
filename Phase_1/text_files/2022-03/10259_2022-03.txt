Footnotes
KOBE B tardy start, blocked inside to turn, split horses twice in the turn and stretch, rallied to clear off as much the best. SPORTINI tracked inside to the
turn, angled out to a brief lead inside the final furlong while no match for the winner. YANKEE MISCHIEF outside run to the turn, continued on in the stretch
for the show spot. MILITARY FORCE raced evenly with no late response when needed in the stretch run. JACK BE NIMBLE flashed speed between horses
to turn, chased to the stretch but came up empty late. NINE REAPER had inside speed to the turn but gave way readily in the stretch run. HOW IT GOES
flashed brief outside speed but gave way with little resistance.

inside, rallied up rail in the stretch run for place spot. TEMPTATION EYES tracked inside, shuffled back at the half, came again for show spot just missing
place. PETRICHOR chased winner throughout, stayed to deep stretch but faltered in the late going. UNWANTED INPUT raced wide first turn while never far
back to quarter pole and gave way readily. MISS HOLIDAY (ARG) never far back to the half, split horses with nothing left in the stretch and faded.

to turn, split horses into stretch but was outgamed late. LIZY D was antsy in gate with, no speed to the turn, rallied into the stretch to be along for third.
LUCKY LAUREN bobbled at the start, rallied three wide past quarter pole bur evened out in the final furlong. MIDWAY'S ANGEL had a slow start, unhurried
to turn and only improved position in the stretch. SOFIA STRONG dueled in two path, led to deep stretch but gave way readily late. BLUE LILY hopped at
the start and was through early, dropped back readily. KULTHUM flashed a brief inside duel but gave way readily and dropped far back.

Footnotes
MY PAL DAL not a sharp break, rushed while never far back, came with a wide run into the stretch and cleared off late under good handling, lugging in while
racing on the wrong lead in the stretch run. ENGLISH TIDE cleared off to the lead, stayed until mid stretch but was outgamed to the wire to settle for place
spot. LEAVE IT TO KITTEN unhurried to far turn with a widest stretch run, coming on with a late burst for show spot.. TEMPLET outbroke the gate, tracked
while never far back, raced evenly with no late gain when needed in the stretch run. Z U AT THE RACES chased pace to the late stretch run but weakened
in the final furlong. RANDELLO chased from two path for three quarters but weakened, in the stretch run. LUCKYINKENTUCKY never factored throughout.
UNANIMOUSLY always raced back while never in the hunt.
