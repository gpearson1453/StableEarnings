wide around the first turn and weakened a bit in the drive. BIG BEND BUCKAROO stalked the early pace and tired. P R STREAKIN was slow early and

SOYBEAN was forwardly placed early on, raced three wide through the upper stretch, came out deep stretch, bumped and bothered Hobbs Hope. A jockey
objection was filed and stewards disqualified Soybean and placed second for interference in the stretch run. HOBBS HOPE was allowed to settle early on,
moved up along the inside around the far turn, angled four wide through the upper stretch, bumped, bothered deep stretch and finished gamely to the wire.
STELLA MARIE was unhurried early on, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and showed good late interest. OUR PETUNIA pressed the pace while
racing two wide and gave way. ATOKA GIRL was slow early, raced two to three wide and never was a factor. ARROWSPHERE showed good speed along
the inside and gave way. MILLI STARR failed to sustain a bid.
