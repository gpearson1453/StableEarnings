Footnotes
B A CHAMPION broke a half-step slowly then moved forward inside rivals to a clear lead, dictated terms up the backstretch racing off the rail, went in the
two to three path on the far turn, kicked clear in the stretch and was in hand late. DIGGER'S GOLD shifted in heading to the first turn, saved ground racing
at the rear, came out heading up the backstretch, went outside foes three to four wide on the far turn, gained the place. GATLING GOLD went four wide on
both turns, was no match for the winner but lost second. SMOOTH BLUES raced off the inside through the first turn in about the two path, went two to three
wide on the far turn passing a rival in upper stretch but was not a late threat. ALEXANDER WHO was caught three wide on the first turn, shifted in to pursue
along the inside up the backstretch, was empty for the drive. AGRONOMO switched outside a rival heading to the first turn, went three wide on that bend,
took closer order up the backstretch, dropped back and faded.
