Footnotes
LIKE MIKE tracked in the four path, bid turning for home, dueled with a game inner SOCIAL AFLEET through the final furlong, and prevailed at the wire.
SOCIAL AFLEET set the pace two wide around the first turn, cleared his inner counterpart leaving the seven furlong pole, showed the way before meeting a
pair of bids turning for home, clung to an advantage through upper stretch, gamely dueled inside of LIKE MIKE through the final furlong, but was nailed at
the wire. GUITAR SLIM laid close up along the inside early on, backed off to stalk in the two path approaching the backstretch, chased from between horses
through the lane, but did not have enough late. RUN ROCKET tracked two wide while in the three path, then shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and
moved up in the final furlong. OUTLAW X. stalked two wide, pressed entering the far turn, bid between horses at the five sixteenths pole, but yielded
between those rivals approaching the final furlong. POWER JET lagged behind, then stayed on along the rail through the lane. LUCKENBACHER never got
involved.

JANETS JAY JAY through upper stretch, gained on that tiring foe in the final furlong, reeled that rival in inside the final sixteenth as and out WICKED ROSE
stayed on, and held from that foe late. WICKED ROSE laid off of the pace in the two path, swung to the six path entering the lane, then stayed on while
hanging on his let lead, gained while chasing a bidding PLAY MO in the late stages, attempted to wear that rival down on the wire, but missed. JANETS JAY
JAY set the pace in the two path, then inside of a pressing CUSTOM BOBBY'S down the backstretch, cleared that rival turning for home, drew off to a wide

Footnotes
C'MON VE set the pace, met SOUL SONG's bid at the five sixteenths pole, shook clear of that drifting foe entering the lane, then held sway while hanging
on his left lead. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT settled at the rear along the inside, commenced a rally while looking to shift outwardly in upper stretch, but dove back
in and committed to a rail charge at the furlong grounds, and finished up with a good kick, but was too late to catch the clear leader. NOSY BANKER tracked
in the three path, shifted to the six path entering the lane, then stayed on while hanging on his left lead, bid for show entering the final sixteenth, and
prevailed at the wire. CRUSADER EXPRESS tracked from midpack along the inside, bid for place inside of a rival at the furlong grounds while hanging on
his left lead in the two path, but was outkicked by an inner foe for that position at the sixteenth pole, and couldn't resist an outer foe late for show.
LOUISIANA HERO broke a bit outwardly, raced at the rear in the three path, then stayed on to surpass outer foes in upper stretch, shifted out at the furlong
grounds, and gained a minor share. SOUL SONG stalked outside of the leader from the three path, ranged up to that foe at the five sixteenths pole, but
failed to keep pace while drifting to the four path entering the lane, then weakend between horses at the furlong grounds. LUKE'S CAJUN STAR was
brushed by an inner foe at the start, got caught in the five path around the turn in midpack, came into the lane in the six path, shifted inwardly in upper
stretch from many right handed crops, lacked a response, and tired in the late stages. RECKLESS RANSOM laid off of the pace in the two path, came into
the lane in the five path, shifted to the seven path in midstretch and failed to factor. HALFMOON REEF broke a step slowly, raced off of the pace in the four
path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and never got involved. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU tracked in the four path around the turn, and faded
entering the lane.

Footnotes
HONEY RUN settled off of the pace two wide early on, tugged between horses passing the three quarter pole to lay behind the top pair at the five furlong
pole, split those rivals approaching the lane, assumed command in upper stretch, then drifted outwardly in midstretch while pulling away, and was wrapped
up through the late stages. LADY CLARE bobbled at the start and nudged an inner foe, tracked in the three to four path around the first turn, then was given
a cue in the three path at the three furlong pole, shifted to the four path at the three sixteenths pole, gained place soon after, and proved second best.
CHATON ROUGE set a the pace a path off of the rail, but proved no match for an outer bidder entering the lane, lost place approaching the furlong
grounds, and held show thereafter. DALLAS VOLUNTEER laid off of the pace in the five path, tracked in the four path into the far turn, ranged up to the
leaders at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace while drifting to the seven path entering the lane, and flattened out. WICKED WONDER broke
inwardly, stalked along the inside, but was restrained back passing the five furlong pole as an outer HONEY RUN pulled along side, dropped back to be off
of the pace into the far turn, saved ground, re-bid for show at the furlong grounds, but flattened out. MISS CHAMITA laid off of the pace along the inside,
came under a firm hold behind horses entering the backstretch, then took the far turn in the four path while trailing, and made liltte impact. MISSION BELLE
was brushed by rivals on either side at the start, prompted the pace from the three path, but was outkicked by an inner foe while drifting to the five path
entering the lane, and weakened.

Footnotes
TUGBOAT broke slowly and spotted the field multiple lengths at the start, trailed around the turn, cut the gap in upper stretch, swung six wide at the furlong
grounds, and surged outside of foes to gain an advantage with fifty yards remaining before drawing clear. MADAME JANE pressed four to three wide, vied
outside of a pair of rivals around the turn, led turning for home, inched clear at the three sixteenths pole, held sway in the final furlong while hanging on her
left lead, but was overhauled by an outer rival in the final sixteenth, and held place from an inner foe thereafter. PHILLY WINS stalked in the three path and
between horses around the turn, shifted five wide passing the quarter pole, grinded away in pursuit of the leader while hanging on her left lead, but shifted
inwardly in the final sixteenth while getting outkicked by an outer rival, attempted a bid for place inside of MADAME JANE late, but was staved off. CRYPTO
BRAVE vied for the lead two wide, then from between horses around the turn, but failed to keep pace with her outer counterpart in upper stretch, and
faltered late. CHARGED TEMP stalked along the inside, chased from the two path in upper stretch, shifted three wide at the furlong grounds, but lacked a
kick to split rivals, then was taken in hand in the final sixteenth when an outer rival shifted across her path. ELSIE GIRL tracked four wide, but failed to keep
pace with in inner foes while seven wide in upper stretch. RUBY BEGONIA vied for the lead inside of a pair of foes around the turn, but gave way at the
three sixteenths pole. MAGGIE'S RETURN raced far back in the four path around the turn, and never got involved. STEPH'S SPIRIT tracked between
horses early on, but sustained an injury at the half mile pole, pulled up shortly after, and was vanned off. A GENERAL STEWARDS' INQUIRY WAS
CONDUCTED REVIEWING THE BACKSTRETCH RUN; NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
COINMAKER tracked along the inside, claimed place at the three furlong pole while having many lengths to find on the leader, took aim on that foe from the
five path in upper stretch, shifted to the eight path to remain outside of that drifting foe while ranging up at the furlong grounds, overhauled that rival soon
after, and drew clear. HOHOHOHO opened up a wide lead around the first turn, managed that margin around the far turn, but tired in upper stretch as
COINMAKER pursued, drifted outwardly while flopping back to his left lead at the furlong grounds, and succumbed to that foe approaching the final
sixteenth. SNEAK PEEK settled far back along the inside, bid for show in the four path in upper stretch, claimed that position passing the three sixteenths
pole, and proved best of the rest. PINK CHANNEL laid off of the pace in the two to three paths, swung tot he eight path in upper stretch, and moved up. US
SECOND CUTE PIE raced in midpack two wide and between horses around the first turn, but made little impact. EPHEMERAL stalked the clear leader from
the two path as that foe's closest pursuer, but tired around the far turn and, weakened through the lane. MSCHITCHATTOUR never got involved. MOON
OVER TUSCANY tracked three wide, but faded around the far turn. INFINITE SOLUTIONS tracked four wide early on, but was done early, eased around
the far turn, pulled up entering the lane, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CLAIRIERE trailed comfortably behind the fast pace in the two path around the first turn, gained between horses into the far turn, tracked from just behind
the top trio turning for home, smoothly tipped outside of them at the three sixteenths pole, ranged up on her own power to gain an advantage approaching
the furlong grounds, glided away with a light shoulder tap passing that marker, then lugged in slightly after flopping back to her left lead while passing outer
tire tracks approaching the final sixteenth. TIZAFEELIN laid close up inside early on, backed off to stalk passing the three quarter pole, re-engaged that foe
into the far turn, led briefly between horses passing the five sixteenths marker, but got headed by an outer AUDREY'S TIME entering the lane, battled on for
place through the final furlong along with that foe after CLAIRIERE blew past, and prevailed for that position. AUDREY'S TIME laid off of the pace in the
three path, gained in the four path around the far turn to bid for the lead three wide at the five sixteenths pole, led entering the lane, but wandered about on
her left lead before proving no match for an outer bidding CLARIERE at the furlong grounds, sparred with an inner TIZAFEELIN for place thereafter, but was
bested. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the five path and outside place-dueling rivals at the furlong pole, but only produced
a mild kick. SUPER QUICK set the pace two wide around the first turn, cleared at the three furlong pole, but had to set quick fractions to do so, got headed
by a pair of outer rivals at the five sixteenths pole, and gave way through the lane. MICROCAP stalked in the three path, but faded between horses around
the far turn.

Footnotes
CONDEMN rated far back along the inside around the turn, swung to the eight path in upper stretch, rallied with a strong kick in the final furlong while
hanging on his left lead, surged to the front with seventy yards to go, and drew clear. CYCLONE stalked four to three wide into the turn, chased the clearing
leader through upper stretch, produced a bid in the final sixteenth as that rival tired, but was outkicked by an outer rival in the process. GUEST SPEAKER
laid off of the pace in the three path, swung to the six path entering the lane, rallied with a grinding charge thereafter, but was outkicked by an outer rival
entering the final sixteenth, then kept on to reach show. BRION sparred with a pair of inner foes for early command, gained an advantage into the turn, drew
clear while shifting down to the two path at the three sixteenths pole, held sway leaving the furlong grounds, but tired approaching the final sixteenth, and
faltered in the closing stages. BET HE'S READY vied for the lead two wide and between horses early on, stalked his outer counterpart passing the three
furlong grounds, failed to keep pace with that rival in upper stretch, then kept on late, but failed to reach that tiring foe for a minor share. LAPIS LAZULI vied
for the lead inside of a pair of rivals early on, stalked those foes into and around the turn, but faded at the three sixteenths pole. SHARP DOUBLE EDGE
chased from midpack in the two path around the turn, and made little impact. CURLIN'S MALIBU trailed in thee four path around the turn, and never got
involved. KIAWAH BREEZE tracked in the four path around the turn, inched closer turning for home, but weakened at the three sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
BIG UNION stalked three wide, prompted the leader from the three path around the turn, led entering the lane, then drew off in upper stretch, and held
sway. WIN YA WIN raced in midpack three wide, awaited racing room behind traffic in the four to five path through upper stretch, tipped six wide at the
furlong grounds for clear sailing, and rallied to reach place at the wire. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY laid off of the pace, inched closer five wide around the turn,
sustained his grind to bid for place at the furlong grounds, gained that position entering the final sixteenth, but was outfinished by an outer foe on the wire.
PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE tracked from midpack along the inside, awaited racing room turning for home, shifted four wide in upper stretch while still
searching for a running lane, and stayed on between horses in the final sixteenth. ABUELO NUNO was forwardly placed two wide and between horses just
of the leaders, tipped three wide at the quarter pole, chased the clearing leader through upper stretch to vie for place at the furlong grounds, but yielded late.
BEEP BEEP broke a step slowly and trailed the field into the turn, swung to the six path entering the lane, improved in upper stretch, then got floated seven
wide at the furlong grounds, and failed to threaten. CHARGE THE LINE tracked four wide, ranged up turning for home, failed to keep pace with the eventual
winner in upper stretch, vied for place through midstretch, but weakened entering the final sixteenth. BACKSHOT laid close up along the inside, stalked
along the turn, chased along the rail through midstretch, but faltered in the late stages. CONGA BOY laid off of the pace four wide, retreated turning for
home, trailed in the seven path entering the lane, and never got involved. CARRY THY CROSS set the pace in the two path, but was headed entering the
lane, then weakened between horses at the three sixteenths pole.
