FRIEND OF AUTISM chased the early pace to the turn between horses, gained ground into the stretch run, vied between runners leaving the furlong
grounds, took command into the late stages and edged clear in the end. NO COVER CHARGE was sent while in hand to set the fractions through the turn,
came under pressure nearing the furlong grounds, was overtaken by FRIEND OF AUTISM within the final furlong, was outfinished and just saved second in
the end. SOMARA stalked the early pace outside of rivals, moved up to press the pace along the turn, was outkicked in the stretch run but just missed for
the place. SLEW OF FASHION stalked the pace along the inside through the turn and weakened in the late going. GEE STREET chased the early pace
between rivals, steadied entering the turn, lost ground along the bend while three wide and did not offer a late bid in the drive. COASTAL STARLITE
bobbled at the start and was away slowly, lacked speed to the turn, made up ground in the late stages but was not a threat.

Footnotes
FAR WEST rated nicely just off of the pace while outside of rivals, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch to confront RUNKERRY, could not completely
shake free from that stubborn rival in the end but held safely under firm urging in the final stages. RUNKERRY was sent to the front after breaking alertly,
set the pace through the second turn, came under pressure nearing the furlong grounds, battled back against the winner but could not hold him off in the
end and was best of the rest. MY SUNSHINE saved ground along the inside while stalking the pace from the midflight, gained ground into the stretch run to
vie between rivals but was outfinished in the late going. GEE GEE WHIZ settled off of the pace while outside of foes and did not have a final kick in the
stretch run. GOING AWAY PARTY was allowed to settle in the early stages while saving ground, improved position into the stretch run but weakened in the
final stages.

ISTANBUL was hustled leaving the break and took command into the turn, set fast fractions into the stretch run and was kept to task in the end as much the
best. SAL N LOUIE stalked the early fractions outside of rivals, gained ground nearing the quarter-marker but was outkicked in the stretch and held for the
place. DRAW THE FOUL chased the pace from a two wide path on the turn, swung widest into the stretch run and passed tiring rivals in the final furlong.
BLAZING JAMIE was a bit green and hard to place in the run into the turn, was two wide along the bend and did not have a late kick in the drive. GALOPIN
GOURMET was hustled from the break to contest the early pace, pressed the pace from an inside position on the turn and weakened in the late going.
LESSONS OF AUTISM was away alertly and was sent to dispute the early pace, pressed the pace along the turn and faded in the final stages. ONCE was
a bit slow into stride leaving the break, steadied off of heels leaving the half-mile marker, chased the pace from a three wide path and gave way in the late
stages.

run, took command into the final furlong and drew clear in the end. CLAIM OF PASSION prompted the slow pace from a three wide path, vied for the lead
leaving the far turn and was outfinished in the late going, while clear of the rest. FULL OF LUCK (CHI) saved ground while stalking the pace, was in tight
while two wide nearing the quarter-marker and did not offer a late bid in the stretch run. OF GOOD REPORT stalked the pace while outside of rivals, lost
ground along the second turn while four wide and finished evenly in the late stages. PRINCE DE PRINCE took command of the pace into the first turn, set
slow fractions while being prompted into the second turn, lost the lead into the stretch run and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
SUNNY SPOT was away in good order and was sent to set the pace, rated nicely through the backstretch run, extended the lead along the far turn and
pulled away in the end. LINFIELD saved ground throughout while tracking the pace, lost ground along the second turn and was outfinished in the drive but
was clear for the place. MEGAMEISTER settled off of the pace while saving ground, angled out for the drive and closed in the late going to secure the show.
ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT stalked the pace outside of foes, lost ground on the second turn while three wide and weakened in the late stages. AWE was rank in
the early going, settled along the backstretch while trailing, was three wide along the second turn and was not a threat. ORCZY (IRE) was forwardly placed
in the early stages, lost ground on the far turn while two wide between horses and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
KAZAN (IRE) settled off of the pace while just off of the rail in the early stages, was steered five wide along the far turn, circled the field into the lane, was
put to firm urging through the final furlong and responded in the end to outfinish the runner-up for the win. J T'S WATCH settled just off of the early pace,
was steered to the two path along the second turn, was roused leaving the bend, chased TED into the final furlong, was overtaken by the winner in the final
sixteenth but kept on to secure second. TED broke alertly and was sent to clear the field into the first turn, set moderate fractions while being prompted into
the second turn, had a clear lead leaving the furlong grounds but was caught with a sixteenth to go and was edged for the place. ON RAGLAN ROAD
tracked the pace from a two wide path, lost ground into the stretch run and weakened in the drive. FUENTE (GB) stalked the pace while outside of rivals,
gained ground while four wide along the second turn but faltered in the final stages. STALKING SHADOW stalked the pace to the half-mile marker, lost
ground while three wide between rivals on the far turn and gave way in the late stages. MANILA MISCHIEF was unhurried through the early stages, saved
ground into the second turn and was not a factor.

the final furlong and edged clear in the end. HERE COMES RALPHIE was allowed to settle in the early stages, was two wide on the far turn, angled out for
the drive, closed well in the final stages but could not reel in the winner while besting the rest. TURA LURA was away alertly and took command of the pace
into the first turn, set moderately fast fractions while being prompted by the winner, held MAGICAL THOUGHT at bay until the furlong grounds and was
outkicked in the late stages. SHEZARUNAWAY saved ground while stalking the pace from the midflight and was outfinished in the stretch run. AMIKO
CHOW (IRE) settled just off of the early pace while saving ground, angled out approaching the head of the lane, gained ground nearing the furlong marker
and gave way in the drive. HOLY ZAGS checked in tight quarters along the first turn, settled just off of the early pace, was three wide along the far turn and
weakened in the final stages. SUGAR KISSES stumbled at the start and was away slowly, was unhurried in the early going, was steered four wide along the

Footnotes
VIVA LA FIESTA bumped HAPPY IS leaving the break, stalked the early pace to the turn, gained ground four wide along the turn, took command leaving
the bend and drew off in the late stages as much the best. ENGEE OMBEE saved ground while chasing the early pace, could not keep pace with the winner
in the stretch drive but held second over an oncoming rival. HAPPY IS was bumped by VIVA LA FIESTA leaving the break, was hustled to chase the pace
to the turn, improved position along the turn three wide, was outkicked in the final stages and held for third. SOO BROOKLYN chased the pace from the
second flight through the turn and lacked the needed late kick in the drive. MS MOAB was away awkwardly from the gate and spotted the field several
lengths at the break, saved ground through the turn, swung widest into the lane and while not able to reel in the leaders showed late interest in the final
sixteenth. GRAZIN AT SUNRISE chased the pace from the inside and was not a factor. BELLEO'S FOREST was off a bit slowly, chased the pace to the
turn from a two wide path and lacked a late rally. CLIPPERVILE GIRL chased the pace from the midflight and faded in the late stages. VASCO dueled with
BLUEBERRY MUFFIN on the front end to the turn, felt oncoming pressure from VIVA LA FIESTA nearing the quarter-marker, could not match strides into
the stretch run and tired in the late going. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN engaged with VASCO soon after the break and dueled for pace duties through the turn,
gave way into the stretch and gave out in the final stages.
