Footnotes
CAJUN MANDATE sped to the lead at the start and held firm around the turn, was put to a drive two wide entering the stretch, responded and remained
clear. SPRING THE BEAST was forwardly placed in opening stages, chased the winner two wide around the turn, sustained bid in the lane and held second
best. RULING FRONT tracked in close range through early stages, hustled along three wide around the turn, remained in pursuit through the lane and
lasted for show. BEASTFROMTHEEAST raced inside off the pace, shifted four wide at the head of the lane and had a mild improve. ORIENTAL PARK
raced three wide in the back through early stages, came five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. HEAVENLY TRIP raced near midpack along the
inside ,cut the corner into the lane, continued in contention then flattened in the final furlong. AFIKOMAN broke outward and came away last at the start,
chased three to four wide and never threatened. RAYO COLORADO chased two to three wide and failed to move into close contention.

Footnotes
DADDY FRANK (GB) checked and bobbled attempting to avoid a stricken rival into the first turn, stayed in range through the middle fractions, fanned widest
for the drive and kicked in late to wear down DEEP STATE in the closing yards. DEEP STATE prompted SENSIBLE JIM from outside up the backstretch,
challenged midway on the far turn, edged away into the final furlong, then could not hold the winner safe. SNOW'S ISLAND was a step slow at the start,
lodged a three-wide bid outside DEEP STATE turning for home, but was outfinished. SIR TERRE raced three wide early, had the two-path on the far turn,
bid through the furlong grounds but flattened out late. SENSIBLE JIM was checked off AWESOME REMIX and forced wide while inheriting the lead into the
first turn, moved in showing the way for nearly six furlongs, and gave way through midstretch. TOLKIEN tumbled over AWESOME REMIX unseating the
rider into the first turn, was apprehended and escorted off. AWESOME REMIX was on the lead approaching the first turn when he suffered a catastrophic
injury and fell, and was euthanized.

SURF AND TURF settled off the pace along the inside, cut the corner into the, bid inside of foes in upper stretch, reached even terms nearing the eighth
pole, dueled inside several foes through the final furlong and narrowly prevailed. ROCKET JOE COPPER had early speed inside, rated back down the
backstretch, re-bid four wide between foes around the far turn, dueled between several rivals through the stretch run and lost the bob in a game try. STRIKE
THE TOP bumped with OUTSHINE at the start, raced off the early pace three wide between foes, advanced five wide around the far turn, reached even
terms turning for home, dueled outside several rivals throughout the stretch run and just missed. STRIKE APPEAL set the pace two wide around the first
turn and along the rail around the far turn, drifted out turning for home, battled on between foes to deep stretch and was outfinished. WINNING FACTOR
prompted the pace two wide, took the lead around the far turn, was floated out turning for home, dueled between foes through most of the stretch but
weakened late. TIMMY M. raced off the pace three wide, edged closer still in the three path around the far turn but was behind a wall of horses through
most of the stretch run and unable to get a clear path until deep stretch. OUTSHINE bumped with STRIKE THE TOP at the start, was in tight soon after,
advanced four wide around the first turn, bid three deep between rivals around the far turn, dueled between foes to deep stretch then was taken in hand
while in tight late. THANK YOU RICKETTS trailed while racing two and three wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
RESTLESS EYES raced in tracking mode five paths wide in the early going, loomed boldly near the quarter pole then took a slim lead turning for home,
came under a drive two wide top of the lane, responded willingly and pulled away. ADIOS DIXIE hustled along inside near midpack, sustained a three wide
bid into the stretch and got a nose up for place. MABEE LUCKYNWILD set a pressured pace inside, shook clear then got collared by the winner
approaching upper stretch, sustained a two wide and got nipped for place while clear over the rest. UNBRIDLED CHROME raced in the back and angled
inside to save ground, chased two wide around the turn, tipped wider for the drive and improved position without threatening the top trio. DOLCISIMA raced
off the early pace, chased inside into the stretch run and lacked a needed rally. EVIL OF COURSE raced in contention three wide just off the top pair, failed
to progress around the turn and gave way in the lane. STACIAS RUBY raced three wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane and never threatened.
AWESOME APEAL raced in early contention then steadily weakened. K COTTEE pressed the pace in early stages, came up empty mid-way through the
turn, was eased up in the lane and vanned off after the race.

backstretch, stalked inside around the turn, lacked a clear path in upper stretch, tipped out leaving the eighth pole and narrowed the gap. CRUMB BUN
stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, could not reel in the winner then vied between rivals for the minor awards.
ALLWORTHY settled off the early pace, advanced four wide around the turn, bid near the quarter pole but weakened in the final furlong. FAMILY TIME
prompted the pace two wide and faded in the lane. HALLAWALLAH played no factor while racing five wide. GRAN BABY (CHI) was outrun while racing

Footnotes
SAYYAAF vied outside of BREAKTHROUGH around the turn and into the upper stretch, shook clear approaching the furlong marker and held firm. DR.
DUKE raced two wide off the embattled duo around the turn, sustained two to three wide bid in the lane and captured place in final stride. CRACK SHOT
lacked speed in opening stages and raced in the back, shifted out five wide in the upper stretch, finished with good response and just missed place.
BREAKTHROUGH vied inside of SAYYAAF in opening stages, battled back from the inside into the upper stretch, failed to be a move on with the winner
nearing the furlong marker then got caught late for place. PARTNER'S HOPE angled inside soon after the start, chased inside around the turn then two
wide in the lane and ran on evenly in late stages. ZANNO hustled along two wide around the turn, tipped wider for the drive and lacked the needed kick for
impact. THING was ridden along the inside around the turn, angled two to three wide in the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. KARNAK raced two to
three wide off the early pace, shifted out wide for the drive and failed to move on. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE

STRAIGHT SHOT pressed RAISE THE RENT from outside early, took over in the three-path under his own power near the quarter-pole, widened through
midstretch still only mildly roused, then was urged late to maintain control. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY was outrun for better than a half-mile, came five wide off
the turn and rallied with good energy on the far outside. THE DISTRACTOR hit the right side of the gate at the start, chased four wide to the stretch, and
was outfinished for the place. GUMP was outrun to the stretch, and passed tired horses outside. HE HATE ME moved off the inside around the turn, and
lacked the needed late bid. SEPTEMBERTEN saved ground to no avail. MATTY'S EXPRESS tired after a half-mile. RAISE THE RENT set the pace in the
two-path, could not hold off STRAIGHT SHOT approaching the stretch, and gave way. MENELIK faded from contention early outside.
