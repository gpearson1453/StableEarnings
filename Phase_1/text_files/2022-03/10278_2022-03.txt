Footnotes
CHARITY STRIPE settled inside, angled out rallying on the final turn, led at the top of the stretch and drew away under moderate urging. MALIBU ANTHEM
broke slowly, quickly moved to contention, led briefly but was no match for the winner. SPECIAL RISK raced within range outside, bid wide into the stretch
with a mild bid. ORIGINALY FROM DOT forced the pace inside, was taken up near the 3/8 pole, steadied again at the 1/4 pole and had no further response.
SOUR MASH hustled to the front off the inside, clear before before the half then faded. LIL MISS HOTSHOT dropped back after the start and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
MISS DILLINGHAM raced close up outside of NOT A TRACE, then pressed that rival, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled, led into the stretch, responded
when roused and drew clear under urging. NOT A TRACE away alertly, set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the far turn, dug in gamely in
the stretch run and came up second best. TOMARIE raced three wide early, settled two wide off the pace, chased on the far turn and lacked a rally. MISS
LOYALTY raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the far turn, angled out and bested the others. CANOOCHEE tracked along the inside, chased inside
on the far turn and tired. TIZ A SHARPIE raced off the pace inside, chased outside a rival on the far turn and tired. FED POLICY raced three wide early,
settled off the rail, off the pace and did not factor.

MAKEAJOYFULNOISE away alertly, set the pace racing with a clear lead, moved up away from the field on the turn, responded when briefly roused and
drew off in hand. LADY MISTRESS chased close up between rivals, chased on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch run and finished well for the place
award. BROAD JUMPER chased four wide, raced three wide on the turn, was outfinished for second and held for third. PRINCESS KAIRA broke a step
slow, chased on the inside, continued inside on the turn and lacked a rally. BALBOA'S SMILE raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn and had
no rally. THREE POTATOE FOUR chased three wide, came two wide into the lane and tired. MISBEHAVING LADY raced three wide off the pace, came
five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. DRIVER'S LICENSE bobbled at the break, raced two wide off the pace and did not factor.
WEDDINIGHTJITTERS was outrun. LA ALTENITA chased outside, gave way and stopped.

ONE MORE SCORE stalked the loose pacesetter, took over at the five sixteenths pole and edged away while remaining safe. SMARTEN UP settled
outside, was put to urging on the final turn and made a gradual late gain. LOOSE ENDS rated along the inside, moved wide into the stretch rallying too late.
A DANGEROUS GUY quickly moved clear inside, was collared on the final turn and faltered. RELATIVLEA dropped back inside and lacked a response.
CATTY'S UNCLE broke a step slowly, raced wide and was never a factor. CHAMPION BY DESIGN stopped after half a mile losing contact with his field and
was eased through the stretch.

J J LOVES BILLY raced off the pace inside, then two wide, advanced on the turn, moved up inside in the stretch, rallied between rivals nearing the sixteenth
marker, gained command and drew clear, driving. SNOW FORECAST reluctant to load, vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, edged away in upper
stretch, dug in gamely and held on for second. WEST HORIZEN stalked the pace, chased three wide on the turn, rallied mildly outside in the lane and
missed for the place spot. COTTON CANDY CUTIE vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, dug in gamely to midstretch, then weakened. LUSCIOUS
LOLA raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the turn and had no rally. I'M A COCO PEBBLES chased between rivals and had no rally. FAIRY WISH
raced three or four wide off the pace and failed to threaten. THATTA BOY GIRL was fractious in the gate, then had her head turned sideways when the

official.

outside then advanced very wide to gain the place. HOLD ME CLOSER dropped back early, lacked room on the turn and swung wide rallying. QUEEN
LUCKY chased the winner three wide to the stretch and weakened. SOPHIA LAUREN was blocked trying to advance near the three eighths pole and faded
when clear. ROSE LEGACY hustled along the rail in closest pursuit of the winner early and tired. SHEWEARSTHEPANTS chased between rivals in the

Footnotes
HOLDTHEFLIGHT was a bit fractious in the gate, stalked close up three wide, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, dueled
with UNDERCOVER KITTY in the stretch run, gained command and drew clear under urging. UNDERCOVER KITTY raced close up in a bit tight on the first
turn along the rail, then tracked on the inside, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, dueled with the winner and came up second best. MAXIMUS
AURELIUS stalked between rivals, raced between rivals on the far turn and rallied mildly outside. KID BOURBON hopped and was off slowly, raced off the
pace inside, briefly waited for room midway on the far turn, then gained mildly inside in the lane. KIDNAPPED was bumped at the start, raced four wide
early, settled off the rail, off the pace, went four wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. REX KWON DO set the pace racing in the two path, showed the
way on the far turn, dueled into the stretch and weakened. NORTHERN EXPRESS was bumped at the start, stalked three wide, chased three wide on the
far turn and tired.

OBSTINATE set a measured pace inside, repelled a rival at the top of the lane and pulled away under moderate urging. DANCING KIKI prompted the
winner outside to the stretch, weakened and lasted for the place. TONAL VISION lacked speed then advanced into the stretch with a mild rally. TILSA
settled wide off the pace, moved very wide into the stretch and flattened out. NURTURING rated close up three wide for six furlongs and faltered. SOLID
GOLD DANCER saved ground just behind the leaders and lacked a rally. BRAVO REGINA saved ground within range to the final turn and gave way. CATTI
LA BELLE dropped back after the start and was always outrun.
