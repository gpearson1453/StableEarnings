Footnotes
TALLAHATCHIEBRIDGE settled off the pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and readily
drew off. GRAND DAVID bumped with TRENDING at the start, stalked the pace two wide around the first turn, vied two wide down the backstretch and
around the far turn, put away the pace rival in midstretch but could not withstand the winner's late charge. RACKET set the pace along the rail, fought on
inside of GRAND DAVID to midstretch and just lasted for the show. TRENDING bumped with GRAND DAVID at the start, steadied nearing the first turn,
saved ground off the pace, tipped out in the stretch, rallied between foes late and just missed third. NATIVE THUNDER was off slow, raced well back two
wide, tipped out in upper stretch and had a mild rally. MAD MOCHA failed to menace while racing two and three wide. FLASH FROST played no factor
while racing two and three wide. SIR SAMUEL tracked the pace three wide and was through after a half. SUPERSTITIEUX was outrun while racing three
and four wide. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
WINNING AT EASE got in tight quarters and steadied around the first turn, raced in range two wide up the backstretch, picked up the pace between foes
late on the far turn, responded four wide at the head of the lane, cleared with a furlong remaining and widened under steady encouragement. PRESENCIA
was off slow at the start and continued unhurried near the inside, tapped along three wide late on the far turn, responded under pressure, angled in a couple
paths under right handed urging and cleared second best. BITTY BABY was forwardly placed into the backstretch and stalked the pacesetter to the far turn,
vied with RAW HONEY with a quarter mile remaining, got collared by the winner in the upper stretch and stayed on for a share. MONTANA JOYCE stalked
three wide up the backstretch, hustled up around the far turn, continued in range with a furlong remaining but failed to kick on. FUNNY FACE settled three
wide through early stages, edged closer four wide late on the turn, came out wider for the drive and finished evenly. ENOUGH RAIN tracked the pace
saving ground, bid two wide into the upper stretch, raced in contention then flattened in the final furlong. MIAMI SOUVENIRS settled off the early pace, was
ridden along six wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. RAW HONEY set the early pace, vied around the far turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
HIGH YIELD KITTEN bounded clear after the start, ambled along through an easy opening quarter-mile, widened around the turn and into the stretch well
off the inside, stayed on his left lead and was kept busy to the finish. LORD DARNLEY was bottled up behind HIGH YIELD KITTEN up the backstretch,
moved out being asked midway on the turn, came four wide into the lane and ran on to be clearly second best. CHROME FINISH was reserved early in
some traffic, came four wide off the turn, and was along for the show. SIXTY ONE broke slowly, raced three to four wide on the turn, and made no impact.
BEYOND MY DREAMS broke slowly, entered the turn four wide, moved in approaching the stretch and could not gain. AMERICAN MATTERS showed brief
speed outside, and was through after a half-mile.

GREEN UP stalked the pace two wide, seized command leaving the quarter pole and drew off while ridden out. FRIPPET broke a bit awkwardly, chased the
pace three wide, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on willingly to gain the place late. TEASING set the pace along the rail,
was collared by the winner turning for home, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. LOVED saved ground to no avail. DESERT DALLIANCE
bobbled at the start, chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. I CROSS MY HEART played no factor while racing two wide. SKINNY
DIPPIN trailed inside.

Footnotes
NO COMMISSION was ridden along out of the gate and raced four wide in the back, circled up four wide past the quarter pole then took command turning
for home, widened to a commanding margin under steady pressure then wrapped up in the end. BOLDNESS raced in range through opening stages then
hustled up into close contention around the turn, sustained a steady four wide bid through the lane and finished second best. SIR AGGRAVATOR hustled
up out of the gate, angled in and prompted the early pace then vied with PERSONAL MEADOW around the turn, was no match when the winner took over
turning for home but ran on and lasted for a share. BEINFUN was not too far back three wide in the early going, stayed on five wide in the stretch and
narrowly missed show. LADNEEDSAHANDLER raced in early contention just off the top pair, was ridden along two wide into the lane and failed to kick on.
PERSONAL MEADOW held a slim lead in opening stages, vied with SIR AGGRAVATOR around the turn then tired in the drive. BRONX raced outside in
the back and had no response.

Footnotes
IF NOT FOR LUCK vied early outside BAHAMIAN CAPTAIN early, remained in the scuffle up front three wide between horses midway on the turn, saw
SENSUAL CHOCOLATE get away from him near the quarter-pole, altered course outside that rival in upper stretch and came back on to get the decision.
AGARRAMESIPUEDES was a step slow at the start and lagged well back early, came four wide off the turn, angled inward past the eighth-pole and finished
gamely on the rail to get the place. SENSUAL CHOCOLATE advanced to contention four wide on the turn, took over drawing clear into the stretch, then
yielded to late challenges from both sides. CRY MACHO raced two wide in range early, and faded through the stretch on his left lead. AWESTAMIND was a
step slow at the start, and never factored inside. PITTSBURGH broke a step slow, was taken off the inside soon after, and never got close. BAHAMIAN
CAPTAIN was hustled up to a short early lead inside IF NOT FOR LUCK, dueled through the opening half-mile, and tired. KING D showed brief speed
outside, had nothing left approaching the stretch, and jogged in.

Footnotes
CATCH THAT PARTY rated back entering the first turn, saved ground in last around that bend, edged closer inside down the backstretch, made strong
progress still a the rail rounding the far turn, came through inside of the pacesetters in upper stretch, burst clear in midstretch and widened from there.
STIRLING DRIVE saved ground in midpack, tipped out nearing the lane, lacked a path in upper stretch, angled back to the rail in midstretch and finished
willingly for the place. A THREAD OF BLUE settled off the pace while racing three wide, went two wide between foes around the far turn, angled out in
upper stretch and was along for the show. MERZAZ dueled inside of GRACEFUL KITTEN for six furlongs, drifted out turning for home and weakened.
LEASE stalked the pace two wide while pulling through the opening half and came up empty in the lane. GRACEFUL KITTEN dueled two wide, edged
ahead nearing the lane, was floated out a bit turning for home and tired. DESOLATOR was outrun inside. ARCHER ROAD played no factor while racing two
wide. STAR SIGN failed to menace while racing three and four wide. POPPY'S PRIDE was up close three wide and retreated nearing the lane. ISLAND
BOY was outrun while racing three and four wide. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
MITICO was prompted to a forward position out of the gate and tracked the top pair under a light rating, began edging up three wide mid-way around the
turn, took command at the quarter pole, roused four wide into the upper stretch, widened to a commanding lead and stayed sharp under steady urging. IT
BEAST ALL was not too far back along the outside through early stages, hustled along four wide around the turn, sustained a steady outside bid for the
winner and finished clearly second best. ON HIS TOES angled to the rail shortly after the start and raced in range, hustled along two wide around the turn,
tipped wider for the drive and cleared the rest. TACTICAL CHEECH chased three to four wide near midpack, hustled along four wide into the upper stretch
and improved position without threatening. MR. EXTENSION dueled outside of ASTAL RIDE in early stages, shook free entering the turn, was no match
when the winner took control approaching the quarter pole, ran on to the furlong marker then gave way. EYES OF CHAMPION raced in the back, shifted
wide turning for home and passed tiring foes. DIRT ROAD DOLLARS steadied in opening stages, chased two to three wide around the turn then faded in
the lane. ASTRAL RIDE dueled inside of MR. EXTENSION for the early lead, could not match strides around the turn and steadily retreated. STRONG
AGAIN steadied along the rail in early stages, failed to move into contention and faded after a half.

Footnotes
PROVEN STRATEGIES took control right from the start, rated along on a clear lead inside for six furlongs, dug in when confronted by SKYRO turning for
home and held firm for the decision. SKYRO saved ground well within range early, moved out to take a run at PROVEN STRATEGIES on the far turn, bid
outside through a long drive and could not get by while staying on his left lead. JOURNEYMAN spotted the field a couple lengths at the break, raced in the
second flight three wide to the stretch, and was along for the show with a mild response. STREET READY tracked outside the leaders for six furlongs,
moved inward approaching the stretch, and lacked a solid closing bid on the rail. WAR STOPPER raced in the second flight toward the inside, and posed no
threat. GOOD JUJU was never prominent. AMERICAN PRINCE chased after PROVEN STRATEGIES for a half-mile, and faded. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
PRONTA sped to the front, set the pace just off the rail, drifted out under right-handed urging in the lane and lasted. HANNITA'S EMPIRE lacked early
speed, raced four wide around the turn, surged late and ran out of ground. SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL chased the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in
the lane and finished evenly to maintain the show. PEARLINTHEROUGH was soundly bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled out nearing
the quarter pole and improved position. LARA'S LADY broke in and bumped PEARLINTHEROUGH at the start, chased the winner two wide and came up
empty in the lane. WAR OF AGES failed to menace while racing two wide. BRIMAGE hit the starting gate, saved ground and made little impact.
VANISHING FAITH was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES took over a slim lead shortly after the start and saved ground around the first turn, set the pace racing under pressure from
FROZEN SOLID up the backstretch and held firm through the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane, came under right handed pressure, responded
willingly and finished going away. FROZEN SOLID broke to the lead then conceded position and remained forwardly placed around the first turn, applied
pace pressure to HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the far turn, was no match for winner but stayed on with
response for second best. SILVERY RILL raced two wide around the first turn and settled nicely near the inside in range, was ridden along the rail around
the far turn, tipped three wide for the drive and ran on for a share. PERSONAL BEST lost some footing a stride out then settled off the pace, urged along the
rail around the far turn then two wide in the lane and improved position without threatening the top trio. BERAVINA settled nicely near midpack along the
inside, was ridden along the rail through the far turn then flattened in the lane. GET BY raced near mid-range along the outside, was ridden along five wide
into the lane and offered no late rally. TOFFEE raced off the early pace, saved ground into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. STARSHIP BOEING was
forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked three wide up the backstretch, stayed on around the far turn then gave way. MAGNIFICENT PEARL raced five
wide into the first turn, rated two wide up the backstretch and failed to respond under pressure. GOLDSTORM GLORY raced wide into the first turn and
midpack around the far turn, lost position running through the backstretch and steadily faded into the lane. RETORT got bumped and steadied slightly at the
start and never menaced. SOMEBODY LOVES ME lost contact with the field in the early backstretch, was pulled up and walked off after the race. RUN UP
