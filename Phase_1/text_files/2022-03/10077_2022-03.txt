FLIRTATIOUS KITTY chased pace to turn, took over into the stretch, roused to move clear late in a good effort. GUILDER sent quickly to the front, headed
by the winner in the stretch, could not hold that on at bay and proved no match to the wire while clearly best of the rest. PASSIONATE HEART good position
to the turn, rallied along inside for show spot. KHOZYS CROWN tracked outside to the turn and stretch, could not keep up. AKA LIONESS never factored.
BEARS BREECHES failed to contend throughout. CANDYCREAM perfect position to the turn, could not go and faded back. MINNIEMOREPROMISES had
a tardy start, never close.
