Footnotes
DISCO PHAROAH coaxed from the gate, showed the way early on until headed for the front five furlongs from home, prompted that rival from the outside
three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole when taking over command, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got shown the crop
to the right side and went clear under a vigorous hand ride, then got geared down inside the final sixteenth to prevail comfortably well clear of the rest.
SINFUL DANCER broke out at the start and was bumped solidly askew conceding two to three lengths to the front before advancing in the two path to take
command five furlongs from home, showed the way under pressure from the aforementioned foe to the outside tucking to the rail into the turn, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner displaced from the front into upper stretch, tipped out straightened away, proved no match for the top one while
keeping on to preserve the place honors. SCHERZANDO coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four
wide into upper stretch and weakened. AL'S PRINCE chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. EVERESTING chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. BE
ONBOARD bobbled at the break, then got bumped solidly between foes conceding two to three lengths to the front, chased just off the inside under a ride
from three furlongs out, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. VINNY TWO CENTS broke in at the start bumping BE ONBOARD in concert with
SINFUL DANCER, then got bumped by the pressure coming from inside and conceded two to three lengths to the front, chased briefly just off the inside
before taking to the rail and was hard held off heels of the leader when pulling with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just
off the inside for home and tired.

ELECTABILITY showed good speed from the outside post then stalked on the outside, was asked in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch
under the crop, gained the lead outside the furlong marker, battled outside of the runner-up while still on his inside lead in the final furlong, was kept off that
foe by the rider late and prevailed. LONG TERM broke in and bumped with a rival, showed speed on the inside of a foe then set the pace, was asked along
the rail while still inside that opponent on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, lost the advantage outside the eighth-pole, fought on well inside
the winner in the final furlong and missed while well clear for the place. IMPROPER settled on the outside, chased in the three path around the turn, turned
into upper stretch under a drive then shied in before being straightened by the rider and weakened but was well clear for the show. CATHEDRAL BEACH
bumped with a foe at the start, settled at the rear early then came under urging, dropped back around the nine- sixteenths, went two then three wide while
ridden on the turn and was no factor. DON THE JEWELER settled at the rear early, moved up under urging with six furlongs to run, came under urging
leaving the backstretch, raced inside to the two path on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths, drifted out in upper stretch and faltered.

OFFICIATING hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside until tipped to the three path half a mile from home, got floated four wide by PRIME FACTOR
when placed to urging three furlongs from home, angled in nudging that rival to the two path at the five-sixteenths before spinning three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command just outside the sixteenth marker, then drew clear to the
finish to score. CHATEAU coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole,
got roused continuing just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under growing lone threat to the outside inside the final furlong, got collared near the
sixteenth pole and kept on safe for the place honors. REPO ROCKS got away to a hesitant start standing momentarily when the latch was sprung, got
hustled and chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the inside near the half mile pole, advanced through the turn into striking
range with five-sixteenths to go and took the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened in the final furlong unable to match the top pair while along well
clear for the show honors. PRIME FACTOR hustled from the start, raced three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths
and was nudged to the two path by OFFICIATING after briefly floating that rival outwards, swung three to four wide for home and tired. TIMELESS BOUNTY
chased along the inside down the backstretch, tipped two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing with seven-sixteenths remaining while
growing detached at the tail of the field, swung three wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
JUMPSTER broke out at the start, was well placed down the backstretch, moved from the two path to the four path under strong urging on the turn, chased
under a strong drive into the final furlong, gained while still on his inside lead into the final sixteenth and got up under vigorous urging. BREAKING STONES
was away alertly from the outside post, chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, gained under a drive to make an outside bid in upper
stretch, dueled with VICTORY BUILT while continuing on his inside lead to the wire and narrowly bested that foe for the place but was denied by the winner.
VICTORY BUILT was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail while still inside a foe on the turn, was asked for his
best into upper stretch, dueled gamely inside of BREAKING STONES in the final furlong and just missed while able to get the show. CENTAVO broke out
and bumped with a rival, was urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, gained under the crop into the stretch then moved out, continued to
advance closer to the leaders into the final furlong, remained on her inside lead to near the sixteenth-pole then switched to the proper lead and finished with
good courage but flattened out some in the end then missed the trifecta. BRUNATE was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn and
came up empty. RUN CASPER RUN stumbled at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, angled in at the rear near the five-eighths,
saved ground on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor. FORGOTTEN MISSION showed speed on the outside then was taken in hand
while pressing the pace, drew even in the two path midway through the turn, vied between foes while still on his inside lead in upper stretch, dropped back
into the final furlong and tired. BLACK IRISH was urged along towards the back, dropped from the five path to the three path early on the turn, moved to the
rail nearing the quarter-pole and was no factor. MATTY'S MARAUDER was urged along off the pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, went four then
five wide on the turn and failed to respond.

the turn coming under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive closing well inside the final sixteenth
and was up in the last jumps to prevail. KUMAR established the front and crossed to the show the way in hand along the inside under pressure from
JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ to the outside, had that rival advance and dueled midway on the turn getting headed for the front inside the five-sixteenths, took the
inside route into upper stretch taking back command straightened away, dug in under a drive briefly inching clear before getting caught in the final strides to
the finish. F F ROCKET three wide in pursuit just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive keeping on to the wire to secure the show honors, then fell a sixteenth after the finish, got apprehended by the outrider and walked off unde
his own power. JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ prompted the leader from the outside in the two path coming under coaxing at the three-eighths when advancing to
duel with that rival, took over narrow command inside the five-sixteenths and spun just off the inside into upper stretch yielding the front straightened away,
then weakened in the late stages to the line. DIRECT ORDER bumped at the start by GLORY ROAD, who broke out a step, chased three then two wide
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and made no headway. PARADE FIELD chased four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. AMERICAN LINCOLN chased two to three wide under coaxing
from midway on the turn, continued two to three wide at the top of the stretch, tired in the drive.

Footnotes
FITZPATRICK was reserved at the back under restraint, dropped further off the pace late on the backstretch, saved ground while let out midway through the
turn, shifted three wide near the five-sixteenths, rallied six wide into upper stretch and closed strongly to get up late. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN tugged hard
at the bit while prompting the pace on the outside under tight restraint, was let out near the half-mile pole, chased two to three wide on the turn, made a bid
in upper stretch, battled outside of TRASH TALKER into the final furlong, held a short lead over that foe into the final sixteenth, drifted out under a
left-handed crop late and was denied by the winner while clear for the place. TRASH TALKER was hustled to the front then moved in, showed the way
under some pressure to his outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was asked for his best into upper stretch, fought on well with the runner-up into
the final sixteenth but was outfinished while able to get the show. CASTLE CHAOS settled on the outside, came under urging near the half-mile pole, went
three then four wide on the turn and lacked the needed kick. KAZ'S BEACH was reserved towards the back of the field, came under urging leaving the
backstretch, went three the two wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. HIM SHE KISSES was well
placed just off the pace, dropped back inside on the turn and came up empty. BUSTIN SHOUT settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch,
went two to three wide on the turn and had nothing left. STANDUP was hard held on the outside then let out near the half-mile pole, went four wide on the
turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
VENTI VALENTINE just off the inside early on, tipped out three wide nudging STERLING SILVER to the four path, raced three wide just off the pace,
advanced through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered three to four wide into upper stretch, took over command with
three-sixteenths to go and drew clear under a drive, then got geared down inside the final sixteenth to the finish prevailing comfortably on the wire.
SHOTGUN HOTTIE chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping to the two path through the turn getting placed to coaxing midway, took the
inside route into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors while never threatening the winner. MAGIC CIRCLE established the front
and showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits under attendance from RADIO DAYS to the outside but facing little pressure save for
her presence, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under pressure for the initial time, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front at the
three-sixteenths, then weakened in the late stages getting collared for the place honors while clear for the show. RADIO DAYS attended the leader from the
outside in the two path, came under coaxing between foes three furlongs from home, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. STERLING
SILVER bobbled at the break getting away last, chased three wide from the tail of the compact field and was nudged to the four path by VENTI VALENTINE
nearing six furlongs to go, tucked two to three wide through the turn getting put to coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and
trailed throughout.

response then just missed the show. GLIDER lost his footing some at the start then came inward, settled towards the rear under some restraint, was urged
along while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn and failed to rally. RUNNINSONOFAGUN broke in at the start, settled off the pace, moved
up just behind the leader with a half-mile to run, chased inside on the turn, moved to the two path approaching the quarter-pole and came up empty.
FROMANOTHAMUTHA was coaxed along towards the front, chased in the two then three path on the turn and capitulated. NONEEDTOWORRY bumped
solidly with an opponent at the start, was reserved off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and failed to threaten.
BOLD JOURNEY was bumped soundly on both sides at the start then squeezed back while in tight, raced near the back under reserve, dropped from four
to three wide early on the turn, moved to the rail late on that bend and was no factor. ROCKEFELLER hit the outside of the gate then stumbled at the start,
brushed with a foe shortly thereafter, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, came up empty in the four path on the turn and
faltered.
