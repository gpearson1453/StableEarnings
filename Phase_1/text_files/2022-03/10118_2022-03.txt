Footnotes
MARTHARITA was well rated on the inside, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then lugged in nearing the furlong marker, then was corrected
with the left handed crop urging, then drew clear in the final sixteenth to prove best. PEACEARELLA was three wide into the first turn, stalked the pace two
wide on the backstretch, made a bid on the turn to take over, then shook clear by the furlong marker, but proved to be no match for the winner late, second
best. LIFE IS ETERNAL tracked the pace three to four wide and then was empty in the drive, bested rest. PSYCHE set the pace on the inside and was
headed on the turn and gave way. SHE SO COOL was allowed to settle early on the inside, then was three wide by the quarter pole and had no rally.

Footnotes
HOLD THE IRISH tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, kicked clear leaving the turn, then was kept to strong nadling to prove best.
SUPER HOUDINI was settled back early, advanced four wide on the turn, then rallied well to gain the place award late. BOCK was three wide into the first
turn while being sent to the front, set the pace on the backstretch on the inside, then was headed by the five sixteenths, angled off the inside nearing the
furlong marker and faded, bested rest. VISHNU was rated along the inside and lacked a rally. YES FOR LESS was well placed on the inside and tired.
AFLEET TRAXX was settled three wide and tired.
