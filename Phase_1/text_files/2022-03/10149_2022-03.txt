Footnotes
COTTON JIM sent clear set the pace to upper stretch bearing out badly there holding on near the apron at the wire. TRAMORE BAY went evenly through
the turn rallying to emerge on the inside in upper stretch pressing a drifting rival hard to the wire. HALO'S DANCE slow early mustered a mild rally down the
lane to pick up the others. SHARINGTHEJOURNEY went evenly through the turn to upper stretch lacking more there. AWESOME OX chased the pace
through the turn weakening in upper stretch. MUSICAL MAN played no factor. THE FALCON was always outrun. SILVER DOLLAR CITY showed little.
