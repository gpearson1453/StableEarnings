Footnotes
GET YOUR GOLD was bumped hard at the start then forced strongly into another foe, spotted the front a few lengths, moved up under urging then chased
on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch under a drive, drifted in under a right-handed crop outside the furlong
marker, switched to a left-handed crop into the final furlong, kept on well while gaining on the tiring leader into the final sixteenth and got up under strong
urging. MRS BELL was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two path while still outside of a foe on the turn, turned into
upper stretch under urging, shook clear under the crop outside the furlong marker, shortened stride while still clear into the final sixteenth and was overtaken
while well clear for the place. DRAW OFF was hustled from the gate, disputed the pace on the inside of the runner-up, vied along the rail while still inside
that foe on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and tired while able to hold the show. HALF BIRTHDAY
broke in at the start, angled out under strong urging at the five-eighths, chased the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped back three then two wide on the
turn, moved out near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. SOARING MIST broke in and bumped hard with a foe then was taken up some,
spotted the front a few lengths, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. GIANT BOTTLE was bumped
hard at the start and spotted the front a few lengths, raced at the rear under urging, started the turn in the two path then shifted four wide, came five wide
into the stretch and was no factor. PER NEW YORK STATE GAMING COMMISSION RULING, SOARING MIST WAS DISQUALIFIED AND MADE

Footnotes
CRYPTO CASH coaxed from the gate, raced four wide in closest aim of the leader early on before being shaken off a bit, tucked three wide through the turn
and advanced once more to prompt the leader in tandem with EUCHARIST between foes and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining outside and was up in the last jumps to the wire. CHRIS AND DAVE hustled from the gate, showed
the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn and came under increasing pressure from a pair getting placed to coaxing in response with
five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole before coming under growing threat to the
outside and was caught in the final strides to the finish while well clear of the rest. AMERICAN RULE coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened while along for the show honors. EUCHARIST coaxed from the
gate, raced forwardly placed three wide down the backstretch before advancing to apply pressure just off the inside now between foes through the turn and
placed to coaxing midway, spun three wide for home, got shaken off straightened away and weakened. LOKOYA ROAD broke out at the start under
coaxing and was corrected, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. RUNABOUT
coaxed from the gate, got taken in hand briefly when losing his lane between foes seven and a half furlongs from home, chased three wide under coaxing
from three furlongs out, went four wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TOWERING ORBIT was hustled to the front then well rated while showing the way, vied in the two path around the turn, responded well under pressure into
upper stretch and proved best under strong urging. SOLIB tracked the pace on the outside, moved up at the nine-sixteenths, vied in the three path on the
turn, spun four wide into the stretch under urging, lost touch with the winner before the furlong marker and was outfinished while just able to hold the place.
MIA BEA STAR settled at the rear of the field, was roused in the two path on the turn, pursued the top two under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly
to just miss the place while able to get the show. FANCY FELINE broke out then was quickly corrected, was urged along on the outside, went five wide on
the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CAPTIVATING CARA moved around just prior to the start and was off a bit
slow, settled while moving out some down the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths then driven five wide into the stretch
and came up empty. GENTLE ANNIE climbed some while urged into the kickback early, moved up coming to the nine-sixteenths, was asked along the rail
on the turn, chased into the stretch and capitulated.

shook away as a pair with SISTER LUCK inside the three-sixteenths dueling through the final furlong to the finish and getting carried in by SISTER LUCK
under a right handed crop to near the rail, dug in under a left handed crop bumping lightly with her main rival just inside the sixteenth marker after getting a
narrow advantage, then bumped again seventy yards from home and gamely prevailed on the wire. SISTER LUCK vied five then four wide outside a pair
from the start, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch taking narrow command three-sixteenths from home, dug in
under a right handed crop dueling with the aforementioned foe and carrying her inwards from the four path to near the rail, got bumped lightly just after
being headed for the front inside the sixteenth marker and then again seventy yards from home while fighting on gamely but was ultimately bested at the
end. GLITTERING PRIZE vied three then two wide inside a pair of rivals coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and clinging to the lead, spun three wide
for home, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go, dug in under a drive altering off the inside to the three path near the sixteenth marker as the top pair
came inwards and kept on to preserve the show honors. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS coaxed from the gate, chased four wide in closest aim of the pace
dispute up front, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. COLBY GIRL five
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home and rode the rail coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued
in the inside route into upper stretch and made no late headway. QUIET TYPE struck the near side stall at the start and got away last, chased three then
two wide until tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and made no impact.
CRICKET WEST coaxed from the gate, chased four wide down the backstretch and then from the two path through the turn under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, tipped four wide for home and made no impact. AFTER ALPHA six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a
mile from home, came under a ride with seven-sixteenths remaining, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and was outrun. There was a Stewards'
Inquiry into the stretch run as well as a claim of foul by the rider of SISTER LUCK alleging interference against MAJESTIC SPIRIT. After review, the
objection was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

NO CHALK chased the early pace then dropped back outside the nine-sixteenths, saved ground around the turn, rallied inside under the crop in the stretch
and closed well to get up late and win her debut. CELEBRITY NEWS bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, disputed the early pace on the inside
of a foe then dropped back at the nine-sixteenths, was guided out from the two path to the four path early on the turn, chased outside through that bend,
gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch, battled into the final furlong and was outfinished then bumped with BIG BEAN CHRISTINE nearing the wire
but earned the place. BIG BEAN CHRISTINE bumped with an opponent at the start, was urged along off the pace, dropped from the three path to the two
path early on the turn, moved to the rail late on that bend, gained while cutting the corner into the stretch then took the lead, led into the final sixteenth but
was overtaken then missed the show after bumping with CELEBRITY NEWS near the wire. CAPITAL GAL was urged along off the pace, traveled around
the turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch, chased the leader into the final furlong, altered course to the outside at the sixteenth-pole and finished
willingly to just miss the show. ONE TRACK MINE chased the pace on the inside of a foe, went four to five wide on the turn and came up empty.
FLATTERY'S MUSIC was bumped on both sides at the start then pinched back between foes, raced at the rear under urging, went three to four wide on the
turn and was no factor. TONIGHT WE LOVE broke in at the start, showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path around
the turn and tired. COSTANTI was fractious in the gate, came away towards the rear of the field then was hustled, moved up to contest the pace on the
outside, vied in the three path through the turn and capitulated.

home, remained patiently handled through the turn and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused straightened away and went clear under a
drive getting geared down inside the final sixteenth. SCOTTY chased two to three wide until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while along for the place honors clear of the rest. RESPECT FOR
ALL chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired while along for the show honors.

Footnotes
SECRET LOVE was last to commence, raced towards the rear under urging, saved ground around the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, came
under a right-handed crop around the three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed crop while rallying into the final furlong, closed strongly to get the lead
inside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear while placed under a hand-ride to the wire. CHASING CARA was hustled from the start, pressed the pace
between horses, vied in the two path on the turn, took the advantage just inside the five-sixteenths, shook clear in upper stretch, led under a drive into the
final furlong but was overtaken while able to secure the place. IMPAZIBLE DONNA was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside, moved a bit
closer with a half-mile to run, vied in the three to four path on the turn, pursued the leader while outside in the stretch and was oufinished but clearly earned
the show. MY ROXY GIRL settled at the rear of the field, was urged along in the two path around the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed response. OUR SWEET GIRL chased the leading group down the backstretch, went around the turn in the three path, spun four wide into the
stretch under the crop and weakened. MOSIENKO settled on the outside, moved in near the nine-sixteenths, went three to four wide on the turn, came five
wide into the stretch and failed to rally. BEAUTIFUL KAREN was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the
turn, lost the advantage just inside the five-sixteenths and gave way.

Footnotes
DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY settled on the outside, ranged up in the four path to make a bid on the turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole then was put to a
drive in upper stretch, fought with the runner-up in the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. BRACIOLE was last to begin, angled quickly to the
outside early, moved up with six furlongs to run, chased four then five wide on the turn, gained to make a bid near the eighth-pole, fought with the winner in
the final furlong and missed while clear for the place. BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES broke out then was hustled, raced off the pace while urged along, moved
closer near the three-quarter pole, went two then three wide on the turn and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. HEADS OR TAILS brushed
with a foe early, tracked the pace on the inside of a rival, moved to the lead before the nine-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage to
the winner at the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. MY LAST MISSION brushed with an opponent early then moved in, settled
in the back half of the field, brushed with a foe and steadied between horses leaving the backstretch, moved from three to five wide under strong urging on
the turn and failed to rally. NOT YET CHARLIE went to the front and showed the way early, lost the lead with five furlongs to run, dropped back along the
rail on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and capitulated. HOT STEPPER dropped well behind, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn and
failed to respond then was vanned off after the race. RED REVOLUTION moved out in the early going, pressed the pace while well out in the track, drew
even with the leader near the five-eighths, vied inside on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and faded.
