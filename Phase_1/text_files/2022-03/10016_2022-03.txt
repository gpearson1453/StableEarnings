Footnotes
BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN tracked in the three path around both turns, shifted to the six to seven path in upper stretch for better footing, rallied to bid at the
furlong pole, and edged away late. TIZ LIGHT THE WAY prompted the pace two wide, led at the five sixteenths pole, shifted to the three path entering the
lane, dug in approaching the furlong grounds as a pair of rivals bid on either side, got headed by his outer challenger a sixteenth out, drifted outwardly to
confront that foe, but was bested. FREEDOM FACTOR stalked along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn, ranged up inside of the leader in
upper stretch in hopes of producing a bid approaching the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer rival at that junction while flattening out.
BOURBON TAN set the pace along the inside, but was headed at the five sixteenths pole, and gave way through the lane. MUSCADINE trailed throughout.

ITELLYOUTHEFACTS brushed an outer rival a few strides out of the gate, sped clear soon after, met NINEJUANJUAN CALL's bid around the turn, dueled
turning for home, but repelled that rival and shook clear passing the quarter pole, held sway through midstretch, and lasted from an outer rival late.
CHEROKEE TAKEOVER took a mild brush from an inner foe in the early stages, laid off of the pace three wide while in the four path around the turn,
shifted to the five path at the furlong grounds, produced a late kick, but missed reaching the leader late. NINEJUANJUAN CALL stalked outside of the leader
while in the three path, bid at the five sixteenths pole while staying a path away from that rival, but was repelled at the quarter pole, and yielded in the four
path approaching midstretch. MY HEAVY SON tracked two wide and between horses, but failed to factor. BOURBON SKY tracked along the inside, but
faded.

ZANDREA'S tracked in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leading trio from the four path around the far turn, floated to the seven path in upper
stretch to remain outside of the drifting leader, ranged up leaving the furlong grounds, led a sixteenth out, and edged away. JUDY'S WAY broke inwardly
and stacked up inner rivals at the start, vied in the three path, then three deep into the far turn, led turning for home, drifted to the six path passing the
quarter pole, as inner rivals fought on, clung to an advantage as an outer ZANDREA'S ranged up entering the final furlong, got headed by that foe at the
sixteenth pole, and was bested. GLITTERARY was bumped by an outer rival and caused to brush an inner foe at the start, stalked two wide, bid between
horses into the far turn, vied around that bend and through midstretch, but was bested by a pair of outer rivals in the final sixteenth. CANDY'S PARADE got
brushed by an outer rival at the start, vied along the inside, fought on through the lane, but yielded a sixteenth out. PAYTONSATTHEPLATE was bumped
by an outer rival and pushed into an inner foe at the start, trailed the field around both turns, came into the lane three wide, but lacked a kick to split rivals
through a wide opening, and failed to menace.

THIEF OF HEARTS set the pace in the three path into the turn, met an outer rival's bid at the five sixteenths pole, repelled that foe passing the quarter pole,
shook clear in upper stretch, and held sway under driving pressure. JOANIE GAL prompted the pace in the four path around the turn, bid at the five
sixteenths pole, but was shrugged off at the quarter pole, then chased the leader through the lane to prove second best. SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI laid
close up along the inside into the turn, lost ground position turning for home, but kept on with a rail chase through the late stages to regain show on the wire.
STONE ARCH BRIDGE tracked in the two path, then from between horses turning for home, vied with those foes for show through the lane, but was
outfinished by an inner rival for that position on the wire. LATTE DOLCE tracked in the five path around the turn, vied for show through the lane, but
flattened out late. MOON OVER TUSCANY was outrun.

Footnotes
MAGA MAN showed the way in the three path around the first turn, then in the four path around the far turn as rivals pressed on either side, dueled in the
five path outside of foes through upper stretch, got headed by an inner bidding BUDRO TALKING passing the furlong grounds, but fought back in the final
sixteenth to reclaim an advantage in the closing stages. BUDRO TALKING tracked from midpack two wide, stalked the leading trio from just off and in the
three to four path around the far turn, split rivals three wide at the three sixteenths pole, bid at the furlong grounds, gained an advantage leaving that marker,
but was outfinished late. STANDING MAN tracked along the inside early on, moved between horses at the five furlong pole to press inside of a pair of rivals
into the far turn, took the far that bend in the three path while creeping closer, bid entering the lane, dueled through upper stretch, but was outkicked by a
rival-splitting foe at the furlong grounds, and yielded therafter. PAYDAY TOO broke slowly, trailed along the inside around the first turn, laid at the rear in the
two to three path around the far turn, swung to the eight path in upper stretch, and moved up outside of foes in the final sixteenth. SYDSTER stalked two to
three wide around the first turn, moved forward outside of foes entering the backstretch to press from the four path, then in the five path around the far turn,
failed to keep pace with inner rivals while in the seven path in upper stretch, and faded. CHARLIES TICKET vied along the inside around the first turn,
stalked entering the backstretch, was outmoved to midpack passing the five furlong pole, then chased along the rail through the lane, and failed to menace.
SHANGHAI RONNIE broke rankly between horses, took the turns in the four to five paths, swung to the nine path entering the lane, and tired.

Footnotes
WILD FOR WYCLIFF set the pace inside of a prompting PRAIRIE, shook clear of that foe at the three sixteenths pole, and held sway thereafter. OTTOMAN
EMPIRE tracked in the four path around the turn, shifted a bit further out in upper stretch, then stayed on late while hanging on his left lead, and reached
place approaching the wire. PRAIRIE prompted the leader from the outside, inched closer turning for home, but was repelled approaching the three
sixteenths pole, gave way in midstretch, and lost place in the closing stages. BALTIC FLEET chased the leading pair from the three path around the turn,
but was outkicked for show by an outer foe in upper stretch, shifted to the six path soon after, and tired without making an impact. SCARY LARRY veered
inwardly and bumped the gate while breaking multiple lengths behind the field, then saved ground at the rear and failed to get involved. MISTS OF TIME
raced off of the pace in the five path around the turn, and tired.

Footnotes
SEVEN JEWELS set the pace along the inside, shook clear at the quarter pole, and held sway through the lane. MELODY ROSE trailed in the three path,
moved up inside of rivals in upper stretch, shifted to the six path at the furlong grounds, and rallied to reach place on the wire. LOVE TO LEARN saved
ground off of the pace, rallied along the rail to reach place in the final sixteenth, but was nailed on the wire for that position. A LOT OF SPUNK tracked in the
two path, chased between horses through the lane to vie for place in the final furlong, but was outfinished by rivals on either side in the final sixteenth. MAW
MAW'S SOPHIA stalked along the inside, shifted to the three path to claim place from an outer drifiting foe at the quarter pole, but hung on his left lead
thereafter, and tired between horses in the final furlong. PRINCESS RENEE laid off of the pace in the three path, came into the lane in the six path and
between horses, and failed to factor. FASHION MOON rated far back in the five path, swung to the seven path entering the lane, but failed to make an
impact. TIME FOR A SONG prompted the pace two wide and in the three path, but drifted to the four path entering the lane, and weakened in midstretch.
MOORAC tracked in the three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and weakened.

Footnotes
PAPA'S BOY set a clear pace a bit off of the rail, rated well in hand down the backstretch and into the far turn, then drew off in upper stretch, drifted many
paths outwardly at the furlong grounds, but held safely. YOUR TIME'S COMING tracked in the two path, gained place from an outer drifting rival at the three
sixteenths pole, then chased the leader home to prove second best. DEER CROSSING stalked along the inside, took aim on the clear leader while shifting
outside of him approaching the lane, but failed to keep pace due in upper stretch due to lugging out, lost place to an inner foe at the three sixteenths pole,
and kept on. UNRESTRICTED rated off of the pace along the inside, then stayed on to claim a minor share in midstretch while hanging on his left lead.
CABO'S RUMOR settled at the rear two wide, improved four wide into the far turn, swung to the ten path in upper stretch, and rallied late for a minor share.
LOUISIANA MOON laid far back in the three path around both turns, and improved between horses late. DREWCITABLE raced off of the pace in the four to
three paths, swung to the seven path entering the lane, floated to the nine path in upper stretch, but lacked a kick. VISION OF ANGELS saved ground at the
rear, but to no avail. RELUCTANT WARRIOR stalked two wide, but faded in the four path turning for home, and weakened through the lane. IM A COWBOY
TOO rushed to stalk the leader from the three path, chased that foe around the far turn, and weakened through the lane. IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT took both
turns in the five path while off of the pace, and tired. I'M D'CAT raced far back four wide, and was done early.

Footnotes
JACK BOB AND LARRY set the pace from the two path while inside of hounding foes, then drew off at the quarter pole. TRADER PRICE tracked three to
two wide into the turn, tipped to the four path passing the quarter pole to take aim on the leader, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, vied
with an inner rival for place thereafter, and secured that position late. CHECK ME OUT rushed early on to stalk along the inside, then chased the clearing
leader from the rail while vying with an outer rival for place, but did not have enough for that position. DEAL WITH HIM rated far back along the inside, then
stayed on between horses through the lane. HUDSON'S TURN was bumped by an outer foe at the start, raced far back in the four path, shifted to the six
path in upper stretch, and improved. CHEATIN CHARLIE broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, vied two wide from the three path around the turn,
but failed to keep pace with the leader while between horses at the five sixteenths pole, then lugged inwardly at the three sixteenths pole, and tired.
AUTUMN'S SUPER CED failed to factor. NACHO BIZ rushed to press the pace in the four path, but weakened after drifting to the five path entering the
lane. ORGERON broke a step slowly, and got outrun.
