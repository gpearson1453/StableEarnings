Footnotes
AUJARA had good position, early, rallied in the stretch and altered course off the rail, drew clear late, driving. LARSA set the pace and dueled on the lead,
gained a clear lead in mid stretch, was outfinished late but was second best. SOMUCHSUGAR allowed to settle early, rallied four wide and closed willingly.
DIAMONDS N DEW vied for the lead and weakened, in the lane. QUEEN HIGH pressed the pace, steadied slightly at the half mile pole, then went evenly.
OPHA MAY allowed to settle, failed to menace. DENIRO'SRUNFORFUN well placed and saved ground, had no rally. SWEET BETTY JOYCE had brief foot
and was through early. MOBIL CHIC was outrun. The stewards posted the inquiry sign but took no action.
