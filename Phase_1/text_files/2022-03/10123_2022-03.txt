Footnotes
LOVETHEONEYOUGOT stalked the early pace in the two and three paths, took the lead nearing the half mile pole and came under pressure toward the
five sixteenths, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn and was steadily encouraged through the lane. REVEIRS MINUTE broke a step slow
and rounded the first turn about the five path, ran outside into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths, challenged at the five sixteenths and raced at a
close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn, though had to settle for second. CHOPRA saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole,
raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened stride. PROUDLY ELEGANT settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path, drifted outward approaching the top of the stretch then flattened stride. QUINCYS WAY saved ground on the first
turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and showed little further. SISTER JOANN broke awkwardly and
steadied shortly afterward, rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn then
weakened. SISTER SECRET LEE was asked for the lead and set the early pace inside, gave up the lead approaching the half mile pole and faded past the
three eighths.

LIME AFTER LIME scraped the gate upon exit causing her rider to lose her left iron, was bumped a stride later but gave chase inside, took the lead at the
rail midway on the turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on well. Note: Her rider never recovered her iron. LIL BUNNY set a pressured pace,
was caught off the rail midway on the turn, lost some ground toward the head of the lane, though came back to finish evenly. SOOEY'S PRINCESS came in
at the break to make contact with Lime After Lime, gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail then relented in the stretch duel for second. SWISS HORIZON
gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path, ran evenly through the upper stretch then flattened the final sixteenth. IN THE NEWS became a bit
fractious in the gate, gave chase and rounded the turn near the rail. TRUENO FUERTE was not a factor.

BUFF'S EYE VIEW settled back off the rail through the first two turns, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled with the lead from the three eighths,
drew clear at the quarter and dug in under steady encouragement through the lane. ELVIRUS rounded the first turn three wide and raced with the pace two
deep from the seven eighths pole, took the nod passing the nine sixteenths, was headed and dueled leaving the three eighths, dropped back at the rail
nearing the quarter pole but dug in to recover late ground. GREYLOVER had a brief early lead but dropped back in the vicinity of the thirteen sixteenths
pole, picked up the chase past the half mile pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for third. STEP OUT DANCING saved
ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. LEG UP rounded
the first two turns about the five path, raced outside leaving the second turn but showed little response through the backstretch. CITIZEN'S FIRE rounded
the first two turns about the four path and showed little response through the backstretch. NAUTICAL WARRIOR raced with the early pace and was headed
at the nine sixteenths pole, briefly gave chase into the backstretch but faded readily and was eased the final quarter.

Footnotes
CHESTNUT LIME rated off the pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn, dueled for
the lead mid-stretch and dug in determinedly to inch further ahead of SONDE ST BLUES through later yards. The latter set the pace between horses
through the front stretch then stalked into the first turn, recovered the lead two deep approaching the seven sixteenths pole, dug in to the challenge of Nazca
Mystery leaving the three eighths, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, but was caught mid-stretch and grudgingly ceded later yards. RUM
RUNNER RED settled back off the rail the first turn, raced outside and bid into the backstretch, improved in the four path of the far turn then dug in to take
third the final strides. NAZCA MYSTERY stalked three wide then bid nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep while
between horses on the far turn but flattened the final furlong. KITE SURFER rounded the opening turn about the three path, picked up the chase toward the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn still about the three path then flattened the final eighth. HARD BEING ME settled off the rail on the first turn and
showed little response through the backstretch. FEISTY AND SASSY took the lead at the rail into the first turn, was caught nearing the seven sixteenths
pole, gave chase from that point but faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
MR CHANCE ROMANCE became a bit edgy in the gate then gave chase through the backstretch, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn,
dueled at even terms through the upper stretch, took over toward the sixteenth pole and widened later yards. MANHATTAN WEAVE dueled for the early
lead and set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn and continued at even terms through the upper stretch, yielded nearing the
sixteenth pole then flattened later yards. ANGELA'S ROMEO gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path then dueled to take third later yards. WHAT
AN OX pressured the pace through the backstretch but dropped back at the rail leaving the quarter pole and flattened stride. MY PHOENIX ducked out
leaving the gate then chased outside, rounded the turn in the five path and ran evenly down the lane. REMYS GUNSMOKE ducked in across the path of
ROYAL PAIN leaving the gate, gave chase and rounded the turn off the rail. The latter was shut off at the break, gave distant early chase, rounded the turn
off the rail and could only close the gap.
