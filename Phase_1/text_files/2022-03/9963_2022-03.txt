the final turn then rallied strongly late but failed to get up in time. AMERICAN ROMA prompted the pace outside, led before half a mile then proved empty in
the stretch. TERRY'S CHARM saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally. LUXURY SUITE lacked speed in the two path and was finished on the final
turn. JUPI'S LIGHTNING dropped back early and weakened steadily. SIGHT LINE hustled to the front inside then was finished after half a mile.

HEY DEWZPOTS took control inside, raced clear to the stretch, was collared in midstretch but held on tenaciously. MISS ALEX stumbled at the start, bid
into the stretch, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. MONSTER RISING chased between rivals then inside and finished willingly for the show.
BALBOA'S SMILE prompted the pace four wide down the backstretch then flattened out. JUST A DREAM broke very slowly, bid extremely wide on the turn
and was no menace. LA ALTENITA saved ground off the leaders and lacked a rally. ANGELSFOUR MICHELE chased behind a wall of rivals early and
failed to respond racing wide in the stretch. WEDDINIGHTJITTERS raced along the inside and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
UNCLE GARY G forced the pace outside, led midway on the turn then drew away driving through the stretch. GIMMEDAMONEY stalked the leaders three
wide and continued willingly for the place while no threat to the winner. FATHER WALSH saved ground, rallied on the turn, angled out in the stretch with a
mild bid. INSTANT CHAOS broke slowly and dropped back at the start then closed well without menacing. THINKIN OUT LOUD chased very wide on the
backstretch and was never in contention. HAPPY BACK hustled to the lead inside, was collared on the turn and gave way. GIMME A JAMESON began
fading into the far turn, stopped abruptly and was eased late.
