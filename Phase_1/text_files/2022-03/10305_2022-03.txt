the final strides to prevail. AIN'T SHE DAHRLIN chased the pace from the inside, then menaced gamely on the turn to vie for lead mid-stretch but was
outkicked by an outside rival and was second best. G'S ALILCRAZY stalked the leader while three wide, made a four wide bid on the turn, then rallied mildly
in the stretch drive but was no threat. MISS M J set the pace from the inside, was in a hard drive around the turn but gave way in the stretch drive. DANCE
