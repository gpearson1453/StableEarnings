Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE TINA was jostled soon after the start, settled off the pace toward the inside then bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved in the three
path of the far turn and dug in through the stretch to take the nod later yards. CARINA had the lead through the front stretch then stalked inside past the five
eighths pole, challenged DANCE LIGHTLY at the seven sixteenths and took the nod at the five sixteenths, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far
turn, dug in gamely through the stretch, though, relented later yards; while the latter closed to a slim lead two deep past the five eighths pole, dug in to the
challenge of Carina leaving the seven sixteenths, gave the nod to that one at the five sixteenths, continued a close factor two deep on the far turn but
dropped back midway on the turn and weakened the final furlong. WHIZ PASS raced well off the pace in the four path the first turn, left the turn outside,
rounded the far turn near the rail but angled to the five path toward the head of the lane and finished evenly. BOCA BIRDIE was brushed lightly at the break,
settled off the pace in the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. I AM I WILL was brushed lightly at the break then settled inside,
picked up the chase past the half mile pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little further. FONDA ROMANA was never a factor.

COMPLETE SURPRISE broke a step slow then closed to the lead two deep while tapering in through the front stretch, came under pressure nearing the
three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and extended her lead under steady stretch handling. HOUSE WRECKER steadied at the rail off the inside
flank of Complete Surprise then stalked, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane.
MARY'S JEWEL raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little more.
LADY MACHO settled off the pace and off the rail, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little more. DUBAI
WAS LIT raced off the pace in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole but showed little response through the
backstretch. After reviewing claims of foul against the rider of Complete Surprise, lodged by the riders of House Wrecker and Mary's Jewel, the Stewards
found no cause for change.

the stretch to hold second. MADY ROSE rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran just off the rail
on the far turn and was gaining on third. UNCAPTURED RUBY settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole,

Footnotes
TRAVEL GIRL drew clear and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, rounded the far turn near the rail
and was steadily encouraged through the stretch. CALIFORNIA SUZY saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
near the rail and cleared second into the stretch. TOTALLY PERFECT saved ground on the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced
off the rail on the far turn and showed little further. CHRISTINE'S COSMO rated close off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then drifted while weakening into the stretch. COLETTE'S SPIRIT saved ground and showed little response
through the backstretch. BETTER BOAT was never a factor. HOLIDAY CONNECTION raced well back off the rail and never factored. RHYTHM TREE was
well off the pace in the two and three paths and was never a factor. LOOKIN BACK rounded the opening turn in the four path then started to fade toward the
three eighths pole.
