SPIN TOWN went to the front, drove clear, saved ground around the final turn, pulled away and proved the best. PALIMONIUM pressed the pace, forwardly
placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SHOETRICK bumped at the start, pressed the pace, saved ground and proved
no match for the top two. GENERAL EISENHOWER raced within striking distance, put forth an even effort and lacked a rally. BIT PART lacked early speed,
finished outside and was never a factor. COUNTRY CUT was bumped and bothered at the start, raced near the back and was never close. THE Z MAN
stumbled at the start, raced in the back and was never a threat. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

SMOKY TOPAZ raced within contention, moved up around the second turn, racing between rivals, pulled away down the stretch and won under steady
urging. TYLER'S ADMIRAL lacked early speed, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a
clear second. SIR OVERANALYZE reared and hesitated at the start, racing in the back, moved up on the outside around the second turn and gained
ground. LEYTON'S HIPPIE raced near the back in the beginning, had an outside trip, made a late bid and was outfinished for third. JUST RIGHT MIKE
challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the final turn and faded. CARLOS PUNCH showed early speed and faded down the home stretch. REAL

Footnotes
MISS CHARLIE SIOUX pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, pulled away down the home stretch and finished well. WORLD PARTY unhurried in
the beginning, made a steady gain, rallied down the home stretch, racing wide, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. WILD TAPIT raced
in the middle of the field, had an outside trip, made a late gain and got up for third. KIND WAYS raced within striking distance, made a mild bid and was
outfinished for third. GEE GEE went to the front, took the early command, weakened and lacked a finish. ETERNAL ENDEAVOUR (GB) raced within
contention, drove clear entering the final turn and faded. VALLEJO lacked early speed, finished wide and was no factor. C C'S BABY GIRL pressed the
early pace, came around the second turn wide and dropped back. ORB'S SOUL raced near the back in the early going and never mounted a bid.
MSCHITCHATTOUR always raced near the back and showed little.
