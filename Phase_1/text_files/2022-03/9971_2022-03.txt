Footnotes
KATE'S KINGDOM stalked the pace three wide, took over three deep near the quarter pole and drew clear under a drive. LIDO KEY raced off the pace
three wide around both turns and finished willingly to gain the place. DESTINIQUE tracked the pace two wide around the first turn and from the rail around
the far turn, lacked the needed rally but churned on to gain the show. PANOTTI settled off the pace along the inside, steadied off heels nearing the quarter
pole, swung out in upper stretch and improved position. KATZ A DREAM set the pace along the rail and tired in the lane. ACT LIKE ARTIE pressed the
pace two wide, took the lead between foes around the far turn but wilted in the lane. ON A TOUR trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
BIG DADDY DAVE dueled inside GHOSTLINER into the turn, got the best of that dispute past the eighth-pole and edged away, then had enough to stave
off KATIE'S COWBOY in the final yards. KATIE'S COWBOY got bumped by TRINNI SUMMER and bobbled just after the start, lagged at the back to the top
of the stretch, rallied on the far outside and finished strongly too late. GHOSTLINER broke out nudging TRINNI SUMMER into KATIE'S COWBOY, nudged
PUNX out of the way soon after that in order to engage BIG DADDY DAVE up front, battled outside the latter to midstretch, then weakened. TRINNI
SUMMER got nudged into KATIE'S COWBOY by GHOSTLINER at the start, saved ground throughout and had some late interest. PUNX got pushed out as
GHOSTLINER made some room for himself up the backstretch, followed behind the battling leaders with aim in the three-path approaching the stretch, but
came up empty. MILITARY DRILL raced in the second flight three then two wide, and steadied while hard to handle off heels leaving the furlong grounds.
THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
KIMARI tracked the early pace racing under slight restraint in the early going, let out a notch and took over the lead midway around the turn, turned back the
challenge from LIBERY MD approaching the upper stretch and finished going away. LIBERTY M D bumped with rival, slightly bobbled and weakened just
after the start, raced three to four wide in the back, moved up to challenge KIMARI for the lead near the quarter pole, could not kick on with winner in the
upper stretch but sustained a steady bid and cleared second best. UNION MAIDEN chased up close along the inside, had to wait for a clear path mid-way
through the turn, tipped out a path wider and headed in pursuit at the quarter pole, chased the top pair into the stretch and just lasted for show. MON PETIT
CHOU chased two wide in close contention, raced between foes and steadied past the three eighths pole, moved out wider for the drive, churned on with
interest and narrowly missed show. SPLASH CASH sped to the lead at the start, continued to show the way then got collared mid-way around the turn and
dropped far back.

ESPECIALLEA tracked the pace two and three wide, closed determinedly and was up in the final strides. MAYOR REMO set the pace along the rail, held
clear past the eighth pole and led until the final strides. SKYWALKING was off a step slow, trailed inside early, went three to four wide around the far turn
and closed widest. SUPERPOSITION settled off the pace while racing two wide, tipped out in upper stretch, rallied between foes but was outkicked. SMALL
REASON raced off the early pace two wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn and was one-paced in the lane. ROYAL WAR stalked the pace
inside around the first turn, prompted two wide down the backstretch and around the far turn and tired in the lane. SPECIAL MEISTER was shut off and
checked sharply nearing the first turn, saved ground and made little further impact. THIS WAS RACE HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
TOUR OF DUTY broke through the gate prior to the start, reloaded and came away alertly, tracked outside ISABELLA'S DREAM while unhurried through
the early going, took over under his own power midway on the far turn, and drew off through the stretch in hand. JERRY'S TURN raced in easy striking
range three wide to the stretch, could not go with the winner but finished with good energy. POLSAR raced wide early in midpack, and gained mildly through
the late stages to get the show. FREE SHIPPING moved off the inside to the three-path approaching the stretch, and improved for the last major share
without becoming a factor. MOONQUEST had no response through a ground-saving trip. ISABELLA'S DREAM sprinted clear early, got overrun by the
winner approaching the quarter-pole, and folded up. FUSION JAZZ was off a couple lengths behind the field, and remained well in arrears. KILLARGUE
KELLY broke outward contributing to the slow start of FUSION JAZZ, and was outrun. ROYAL HARRY was always far back. JUSTPLAYITLOUD faltered
inside. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
BRASSTOWN sped to the lead soon after the start and set the pace inside up the backstretch, continued on top around the turn then took on the challenge
from HERO TIGER at the head of the lane, fought back gamely from the inside and held late under a driving finish. HERO TIGER tracked the pacesetter two
to three wide in early stages, launched a two wide bid for BRASSTOWN near the quarter pole, dug in determinedly two wide through the lane but could not
get by the game winner. JOE DI BAGGIO stalked near the inside up the backstretch, tipped out wide mid-way around the turn, ran on three wide into the
lane and finished well clear over the rest. LUXERO raced four to five wide off the early pace, was ridden along three wide into the upper stretch and never
threatened. AEQUOR stalked the pacesetter along the outside up the backstretch, weakened around the turn and continued to tire in the lane. STAY HOME
was reserved racing wide in early stages, tucked inside around the turn and never menaced. MEADE was not too far back in early stages, came up empty
late on the turn, pulled up in the last stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
FAMOUS GENT set the pace in the two path, kicked clearing nearing the head of the lane and held clear under a drive. BEE BY THE SEA settled off the
pace outside, raced five wide around the turn, finished willingly outside and was up late for the place. LOYAL LOUIE raced off the pace two wide between
foes, angled to the rail nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into the lane, moved into second approaching the eighth pole but was outfinished. NO
COMMISSION was off a bit slowly, trailed five wide for a half and rallied belatedly. PUTIN ONLINE tracked the pace from the rail, tipped out in upper
stretch, had aim on the winner but weakened. LUCKY AS A SEVEN pressed the winner in the three path and tired in the drive. BEINFUN saved ground and
failed to menace. MONY had early speed three wide between foes and faded around the turn. EMICRACK (CHI) was up close while racing four wide and
came up empty in the lane. LADNEEDSAHANDLER played no factor while racing four wide.

Footnotes
NOSTALGIC broke out making some light contact with PRINCESSOFTHENORTH, saved ground behind the first flight early, split horses and confidently
moved outside LIAM'S KISS approaching the stretch, overpowered that one after straightening away for the drive, and drew off while merely flashed the
crop. LIAM'S KISS led early before yielding to MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER around the first turn, stalked outside the latter through the backstretch run, rebid
taking the lead again after six furlongs, took a couple of awkward steps as NOSTALGIC came calling to her outside at the top of the lane, proved no match
and ran on best of the others. EASY COME EASY GO was never far back, came under a ride on the far turn three then four wide, and could not keep pace
with the top two after six furlongs. MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER took over outside LIAM'S KISS on the first turn, got overhauled by that same rival midway on
the far turn, and gave way readily. PRINCESSOFTHENORTH brushed with NOSTALGIC coming out, raced two to three wide on the turns and was not a
factor. FREEDOM ROSE raced wide trailing throughout.

the furlong marker and held clear under a driving finish. GIRLY THE BUTCHER bumped with rival not long after the start, was unhurried four to five wide up
the backstretch, swung wide into the upper stretch, rallied along the outside and captured place. Z FIRST tugged while rated under a snug hold heading into
the backstretch, prompted the pace to the final turn then moved up to challenge approaching the quarter pole, continued on top by a slim margin into the
upper stretch, got collared by the winner with a furlong left to run then got edged late for place. SWOONATRA tugged while rated around the first turn
settled in range up the backstretch, waited for a clear path near the quarter pole, roused two wide in the upper stretch and failed to kick on. RAW HONEY
bumped with rival shortly after the start then settled off the early pace, was ridden along four wide into the upper stretch and improved position without
threatening. ICE LOVE was reserved racing in the back, saved ground around the final turn, tipped out wider for the drive and passed tiring rivals. JAIMIE'S
WARRIOR raced near midpack near the inside, waited along the rail for a clear path around the final turn, tipped out wider with a furlong left to run and
failed to kick on. TIZMET held a slim lead around the first turn, vied inside of TOURASTAR up the backstretch, fought back around the final turn then gave
way. TOURASTAR dueled outside of TIZMET up the backstretch, battled on around the far turn then tired in the drive. TOOSWEETTOBESOUR raced near
midpack then failed to keep pace late on the far turn. PRETTY FLATTERING was forced to check sharply shortly after the start, lost all momentum, dropped
