Footnotes
BIG BRAND settled just off of the early pace, was steered to the inside along the backstretch run, mounted a rail bid along the second turn, took a clear lead
into the stretch run and edged away in the end. FRONT OF LINE (GB) stalked the pace from a three wide path, gained ground on the second turn, was
outkicked by the winner in the stretch run but was a clear second over the rest. ALLISON'S SURPRISE saved ground in the early stages while lacking early
speed, advanced along the second turn while on the inside, finished evenly in the late stages but kept on to be an easy third. ROSES FOR MARILYN
settled just off of the early pace while four wide on the first turn, continued that wide trip into the second turn and gave way in the stretch run. DINO'S HEAT
was away alertly and took command of the pace into the first turn, set prompted fractions into the second turn, was caught nearing the quarter-marker,
steadied while losing ground into the stretch run and faded in the late going. CLIFFSOFTHUNDER (GB) was a bit eager on the first turn while attending the
pace, continued to track the leader along the backstretch run, stopped along the second turn and gave out in the late stages.

Footnotes
GO THRU THE HOLE stalked the pace while three wide between foes on the turn, gained ground into the stretch run, was put to firm urging in the final
stages and made a late push to prevail. CHUMLY contested the quick early pace with SONORA SERMON, dueled with that foe through the turn three wide,
vied for the lead at the furlong marker, was confronted in the final sixteenth by the winner and was bested in the final strides while clear of the rest for the
place. SONORA SERMON disputed the early pace with CHUMLY, carved out reasonably fast fractions while dueling on the front end through the turn,
yielded in the final sixteenth to the top pair but held third in the end. RUNNING ON EMPTY saved ground while chasing the pace on the turn, gained ground
leaving the bend, lacked room at the furlong grounds, steadied in tight quarters leaving the furlong marker and made a mild late gain, just missing for third.
FLOYD KNOWLES chased the early pace outside of foes, advanced on the turn four wide and was outkicked in the late stages. HANDS OFF was away a
bit slowly, lacked early speed into the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
JEDI KNIGHT settled off of the early pace, saved ground through the backstretch run, was steered three wide on the second turn, had a good late kick in
the drive and inched clear in the final stages. SOUTHEAST ASIA settled off of the pace while saving ground, lacked room while in tight quarters nearing the
quarter-marker, improved position into the stretch run and continued that rally to earn the nod for second in the end. DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI took command
of the early pace and set the fractions through the second turn, lost the lead to HULA KING in upper stretch, kept on in the final furlong, was outfinished in
the end and was just edged out for second. HULA KING attended to the pace from a two wide path through the first half-mile, confronted the pacesetter off
of the second turn, edged to a narrow lead at the furlong marker but weakened in the late going. COLLUSION DELUSION had an awkward beginning and
spotted the field leaving the break, was unhurried through the backstretch run, was steered outside of rivals on the second turn and lacked a late rally.
MONSTRODAMOUS was four wide on the first turn then settled behind the early pace while still close up through the backstretch run, kept a three wide
position through the far turn, gained ground into the drive but gave way in the final stages. SLEEP OVER tucked in behind the early leaders on the first turn,
stalked the pace through the second turn while saving ground and tired in the late stages.

THE PHARAOH'S GIRL broke alertly and was hustled to the front in the early stages, set a reasonably quick pace through the turn, was kept to task through
the lane and drew clear in the late stages. EMPIRE HOUSE was bumped by IMA HAPPY CAT leaving the break, chased from the rear while outside of
rivals through the turn, closed in the stretch run and could not reel in her stablemate but held safely for the place. TIP TOP GAL chased the pace from a two
wide path on the turn, was outkicked in the stretch run and just saved third in the end. DO YOU HEAR THAT broke out at the start, pressed the early quick
pace through the turn three wide, lost ground into the stretch run and gave way in the late going. IMA HAPPY CAT bumped EMPIRE HOUSE at the start,
chased the early pace from the inside, was under a tight hold nearing the turn then steadied leaving the three furlong marker, held position through
midstretch but weakened in the final stages.

Footnotes
UNTO THEE broke sharply and was sent to the front at the start, showed good early speed while setting fast fractions through the turn, extended the lead
into the stretch and drew away in the final stages. EXECUTIVE CHEF was away a bit slowly leaving the break, chased from the rear through the turn,
navigated through weakening foes while closing in the drive and was up in time to get the nod for second. HUNTER JOHN stalked the pace from a three
wide path along the turn, lost ground into the stretch run, was outkicked in the late stages and just missed for second. YOU KIDDING ME tracked the fast
pace from a two wide path, was outrun into the drive and tired in the late going. OBVIOUS chased the pace outside of foes and weakened in the stretch run.
WINTER FALCON stalked the early pace while saving ground, lost ground into the stretch run and gave way in the final stages. DIAMOND WILLOW was a
bit slow into stride in the early going, lacked speed into the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TIZ AN EDVENTURE settled just off of the early pace while saving ground, advanced on the second turn, was roused at the top of the lane, vied for the lead
at the furlong grounds and pulled away in the end. FABRIANA was unhurried through the far turn while saving ground, tipped out at the top of the lane,
rallied well in the late stages and was no match for the winner in the end but was up in time to get the nod for second. PROOF OF JAZZ broke alertly and
contested the pace along the first turn, checked leaving the first turn, pressed the pace into the second turn, took the lead into the stretch drive, could not
hold off the winner in the final furlong and was outfinished, while just missing for second. GRIGORO settled off of the pace, advanced three wide on the
second turn but flattened out in that effort and gave way in the drive. AWESOME AMANDA contested the early pace with PROOF OF JAZZ, shook free of
that foe into the backstretch run, was confronted again by PROOF OF JAZZ into the far turn, ceded the lead nearing the top of the lane and gave way in the
late stages. BANDEENA stalked the pace in the early stages, lost ground on the second turn while four wide and faded in the late going.

TORPEDO AWAY took back in the early stages and settled off of the fast early pace while saving all of the ground, was roused at the top of the lane, made
a bold inside bid in mid stretch, struck the front with a sixteenth to go and held for the win in a blanket finish. LORD BRANCUSI chased the pace two wide
on the turn, was blocked and lacked room in upper stretch, found a seam inside of the furlong grounds, made a late push and was nipped for the win while
earning the nod for the place. OUR BOLD PRINCE chased the pace two wide on the turn, swung six wide for the drive, steadied in tight quarters
approaching the sixteenth-marker, closed fast in the final stages and just missed for the win and place, while holding for the show. SONOFAFINCH was
carried out nearing the half-mile marker and chased the quick pace while outside of rivals, swung widest into the drive, made a strong late run and just
missed for the win. MURPHYS TIGER chased the pace three wide on the turn, advanced in upper stretch and was outfinished in the late stages.
COUNTING CARDS chased the pace outside of foes on the turn, closed in the stretch run but was outkicked in the final stages. STRUT TO THE WIRE was
bumped by STORMY CHARMANT at the break and was off a step slowly, lacked early speed through the turn, rallied behind a wall of horses in upper
stretch and was outfinished in the end. STORMY CHARMANT bumped STRUT TO THE WIRE leaving the break, showed good speed while disputing the
early pace, was confronted nearing the furlong marker, ceded the lead in the final furlong and lacked a late response. R M C HOOK'EM pressed the fast
early pace from a three deep position on the turn, took a narrow advantage nearing the eighth pole and was outfinished in the late going. OFFSHORE
AFFAIR disputed the early pace, lost position two wide between rivals on the turn, improved position to vie for the lead nearing the furlong grounds and
gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
I GOT SPEED was sent leaving the break and stalked the pace from a two wide path through the turn, was put to firm urging in upper stretch, overtook
WESTERN SIERRA inside of the furlong grounds and edged clear in the end. ENJOY IT STRAIT settled off of the pace while saving ground through the
turn, swung out six wide for the drive, made a strong late rally, finished well in the late stages and was up in time to secure the place. BLESSED BROTHER
chased the pace from a three wide path on the turn and closed in the drive to get up for third. ROISTER was forwardly placed while along the inside through
the turn, gained ground into the stretch run, angled out leaving the furlong marker and just missed for the show in the end. WESTERN SIERRA was away
alertly and was hustled to the front in the early going, maintained a clear edge over I GOT SPEED through the turn and into the drive, was overtaken by the
winner leaving the furlong marker and weakened in the final stages. DANNY MICHAEL saved ground while lacking early speed, advanced into the stretch
run and made a mild late rally in the drive. BRANNIGAN tracked the early pace outside of rivals, lost ground into the stretch run and tired in the late stages.
GLORIOUS CITY lacked early speed, was three wide on the turn and did not have a late response. LOVE THAT KID was outrun in the early stages, saved
ground through the turn and did not have an impact. WIND IN HIS SAIL ducked in at the start and spotted the field many lengths, continued on while well
behind the field and was never involved.
