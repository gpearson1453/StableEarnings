Footnotes
DR GS SWEETIE was away in good order to set a pressured pace, was rated through the back-stretch, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off
with something left. BLAZING MISS JOJO broke sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well
to hold the place. SANDY SUNSHINE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid.
RANDOM PLEASURE was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. INFO'S TREASURE showed no early speed,
saved ground throughout and did not reach contention. TRINNI SUNSET chased the leaders from the inside for five furlongs and weakened.

PREDETERMINATION was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore into the lane but could not match
strides with the winner late. SHE'S A LADY GRIZ sprinted clear at once, drifted out nearing the half, came back to set a pressured pace and gave way
grudgingly in the drive. PANCAKES AND BEER showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn and finished with a late bid. UPTOWN
RHAPSODY was off slow, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and did not menace.
KARALINKA was forwardly placed early, moved six-wide through the second turn and gave way in the drive. GRAN MANNA was void of early speed, raced
four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
WICKED FORTITUDE stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a sixteenth to run and edged away late. UPPER ROOM
lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. KING LEBRON sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the
pace and gave way through the final sixteenth. GOT EVEN SMARTER was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch,
rider lost whip with a furlong to run and finished willingly. PARLEY STREET settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished
evenly in the drive. I AM ALLTHATYOUARE chased the leaders from off the rail and gave way through the final furlong. CHEF was off a step slow then
allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. WESTERN SMOKE raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn
and weakened.
