Footnotes
COX'S LEDGE , two wide the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced three deep to bid for the lead turning for home, dueled outside
DR. FERBER through the lane and narrowly prevailed. DR. FERBER , patiently handled down the backstretch, began a rally in the two path mid way on the
far turn, was taken to the inner rail at the head of the stretch, challenged for the lead in upper stretch, dueled and hung. MAID THE JOURNEY lacked
speed, worked between horses in the stretch and offered a slight rally. ALBERTANO hopped then was steadied at the break, swung four wide in upper
stretch and lacked a rally. SHOULDA HAD IT hugged the inner rail on both turns and gave way in upper stretch. DREAMING OF CARATS set the pace
along the inner rail, drifted to the two path leaving the far turn and faltered. CRYING FOR MORE , outside horses down the backstretch while chasing the
pace, pulled up lame on the far turn and was vanned off.

Footnotes
KRUG rated close up while saving ground, had ample room along the rail to advance past the quarter pole, bid inside the leader and took command a
sixteenth out, briefly spurted clear then was fully extended to hold. MONEY CODE , unhurried early while saving some ground, swung five wide the drive,
leveled off to his best stride past the eighth pole and had his rally fall just short. FIVE STAR PHIL rated outside a rival while stalking the pace, moved up to
engage the leader nearing mid turn, dueled briefly, shook clear while four wide in upper stretch, kept on under left handed asking past mid stretch, ceded
command a sixteenth out then gave way grudgingly. YO NESSROUNDONKERN stalked two to three wide, moved up some past the three eighths, angled
out to chase on his left lead nearing mid stretch, switched over to his correct lead for the final sixteenths and churned on. GREYLOVER cleared early, set
the pace towards the inside, was joined mid turn, sparred to the head of the lane while in the two path, stayed on with effort to the sixteenth pole then faded.

Footnotes
JOHN THE BEAR prompted the pace outside HE'S ORIENTATE, over took that one approaching the stretch, drifted out entering the lane, drove clear and
drifted out late. ROYAL THUNDER , three deep around the turn, was floated out a bit turning for home then gamely chased the winner through the lane.
CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO drifted in and bumped with HE'S ORIENTATE soon after the break, raced in the three path on the turn while stalking the pace
and failed to rally. HE'S ORIENTATE , jostled on both sides leaving the starting gate, sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail and weakened through
the stretch. WHATCHASAID bumped and pinched back FERMAT when bearing out at the break, raced in the two path around the turn and through the
stretch and lacked a rally. RAPID RESPONSE , four deep on the turn, faltered. FERMAT , bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate, trailed.

BELLSWILLBERINGING moved to command inside rivals leaving the chute and handled outside pressure, pulled her way clear with five and a half furlongs
remaining, dictated the issue from there while two wide, opened up under coaxing in upper stretch, was kept alert with one ask of a right handed stick past
the three sixteenths then continued clearly best while steadily hand ridden to the wire. TIKTOKNAWAY stalked the winner three wide, was ridden along into
the lane and finished willingly. GOT A GOOD REASON pulled her way forward between runners near the five eighths, dropped back a bit mid turn, shifted
out four wide and found some more through the lane. CINNAMON DREAM , four wide within reach past the three quarter pole, dropped back leaving the far
turn and failed to generate a run from there. ALL THE WAY MAE , a bit keen making her way forward past the three quarter pole, tracked into the turn, had
no response nearing the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GRANT , clear and angled in approaching the first turn, set the pace along the inner rail, was pressed throughout and dug in tenaciously to
prevail. SIERRA LEONA , a bit rank behind the winner approaching the first turn, prompted the pace outside that out in a game effort. BREVIARY , three
wide the first turn, remained outside horses down the backstretch, was bumped by DUSTWHIRL WONDER leaving the backstretch, circled rivals the far
turn, raced on her left in the stretch and flattened out. DUSTWHIRL WONDER , a forward factor inside horses, bumped BREVIARY when drifting out
entering the far turn and weakened through the stretch. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY bumped with ARBUTUS leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on
both turns and faltered in upper stretch. POSTINO'S SECRET was outrun. ARBUTUS bumped with TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY leaving the starting gate and
faltered on the far turn.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN CARDO , bumped soon after the break, was patiently handled while saving ground, crept closer leaving the three eighths, eased out and worked
between runners nearing the eighth pole, put a head in front while outside SPRITZER near the sixteenth pole, dueled and dug in under solid handling to
prevail. SPRITZER was sent clear early, dropped in and set the pace, met an initial bid from UNCLE JEROME near the quarter pole, kept that one at bay to
mid stretch, dug in when collared by the winner, lost the lead a sixteenth out but battled on valiantly to the wire. UNCLE JEROME came in a bit soon after
the break and bumped with a rival, stalked the pace three wide, ranged up to threaten nearing the quarter pole, fought outside foes to mid stretch, was
floated a bit then flattened out. TRANSFER THE FUNDS was steadied off the heels of UNDER FIRE nearing the first turn, raced well back while off the rail
past the five eighths, swung five wide for the drive and had belated interest. UNDER FIRE , a bit rank and keyed up early, edged up four wide to be within
range after three furlongs, gave hard chase past the five sixteenths and weakened. WAY MORE , bumped soon after the start, raced between runners early
and failed to respond. WONDERVILLE , in the clear while off the pace past the five eighths, had no kick. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE stalked the pace two wide,
was under a hearty ride past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and retreated. DOUBLBARRELBOURBON lagged well back while saving
some ground early then never fired. EL BONITA , four to five wide into the first turn, retreated.

Footnotes
D' RAPPER took over early to the inside, handled outside pressure while under rating, moved away with eased around the turn, opened up in mid stretch
and maintained a comfortable advantage under mild encouragement. CARIBBEAN (AUS) pressed the pace outside the winner and kept on willingly. IRISH
RIVIERA chased and held the show. CLOSER LOOK lacked a solid bid. HALITE , off the pace, raced between foes late and was not a factor.
GOODLUCKCHUCK stalked three wide and faded. OTHER THINGS EQUAL stalked the pace, swung wide and gave way. SILENT MALICE was getting out
mid turn, bolted nearing the lane, was eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
HEIDI T saved ground around the turn, found room along the rail to challenge for the lead in upper stretch and drew clear under pressure. WATCH YOUR
TONE prompted the pace outside HOLY PINK, was fanned three wide in upper stretch, remained on her left lead and rallied. HOLY PINK bore out leaving
the starting gate, sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, drifted to the two path entering the stretch and weakened the final furlong.
ROYAL FLUSH GIRL , along the inner rail on the turn and in the stretch, passed tired foes. SPRINKLE THIS , last after being squeezed back leaving the
starting gate, passed tired rivals. LA REINA SUSAN , very wide turning for home, lacked the necessary late response. SUPERIORITY , three deep chasing
the pace around the turn, faltered. ILLUSION OF HOPE was outrun.
