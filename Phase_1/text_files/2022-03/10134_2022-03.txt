Footnotes
CALIFORNIA GIGI stalked three wide up the backstretch, vied with REAL GOOD VYBZ around the far turn then shook free turning for home, widened to a
clear advantage then held late under a driving finish. KNOWWHENTOFOLDEM saved ground around the first turn and settled off the early pace, circled up
closer four wide late on the final turn then came five wide into the upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and was getting to the winner in closing strides.
IMOTO was unhurried up the backstretch, hustled along six wide into the upper stretch, sustained steady response and cleared the rest. JUANITA R settled
through early stages, moved into contention three wide around the far turn, sustained bid to mid-stretch then flattened out. REAL GOOD VYBZ pressed the
early pace, dueled with the winner around the far turn then faded in the final furlong. SAY NO MORE fanned wide around the first turn, rated off the early
pace, was ridden along two wide between foes around the far turn and offered no late rally. SONGTELLER raced near midpack, was ridden inside around
the far turn and failed to respond. MOSA MIA bumped with rival at the start, was reserved in the back, ridden five wide around the far turn and failed to
move on. WI FI fanned wide around the first turn, raced in range up the backstretch, urged two wide then inside around the far turn and steadily faded.
PRETTYASPINK saved ground to no avail. RIDE LITTLE GIRL showed speed and came up empty after a half. RAVEN'S HARLAQUEEN came up empty
entering the far turn.

Footnotes
LUANN settled off the early pace, advanced three and four wide around the turn, closed down the center of the track and was up on the wire. LIZA STAR
sped to the front, set the pace in the two path, held clear to deep stretch and was nailed on the wire. INFATUATING chased the pace from the rail, lacked
the needed rally but stayed on to maintain the show. WEDONTBELIEVEHER stalked the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. BEAUTY QUEEN had
her head turned at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. LAWN DART was outrun inside.

Footnotes
I'M SO SORRY prompted the pace outside BLYTHE SPIRIT for six furlongs, bid for command between horses through upper stretch, battled inside
KIVALINA late and prevailed by the slimmest of margins. KIVALINA tracked three wide to the stretch, had aim through a long drive outside I'M SO SORRY
and just missed. MITIGATION saved ground to the far turn, moved out for the drive, finished willingly outside the top two but needed more. QUEEN MACHA
was outrun early, shifted out three wide on the far turn getting a bit closer, went to the far outside for the drive and gained mildly. CHARLEY RUDE raced in
the second flight for six furlongs, fanned five wide off the far turn and made no impact. SPURT spotted the field a two-length head start at the break, and
posed no threat inside. BLYTHE SPIRIT established a moderate pace inside for six furlongs, then yielded readily. WHY LEA was no factor three to four wide
throughout. PEACH COBBLER tired after six furlongs.

Footnotes
PEACHY WEACHY raced three wide just off the top two leaders then vied with PRESSLEYS HOPE around the turn, cleared three wide into the upper
stretch, tipped wider under left handed pressure and finished going away. SCIENCE FRICTION raced in the back in opening stages then edged up into
close contention along the rail, was patiently handled around the turn then shifted five wide heading into the lane, sustained a solid bid for the winner and
gained second best. PRESSLY'S HOPE vied for the early lead with PLAYA INCLUSION, fought back when challenged by the winner mid-way around the
turn, could not match strides approaching the upper stretch then got edged late for place. GOLDEN BOW tracked up close racing between foes in early
stages, continued in range while ridden three wide around the turn then flattened out in the upper stretch. DEL REY DOLLY rated three wide in range up the
backstretch, failed to respond under pressure around the turn then drifted out wide approaching the upper stretch and faded. PLAYA INCLUSION dueled for
the early lead with PRESSLEYS HOPE, fought back into the turn then came up empty past the quarter pole and retreated.

Footnotes
KHOSEA was reserved early toward the inside, shifted out four wide closing in behind the leaders with a quarter-mile remaining, tipped further out for
clearance into the stretch, and rallied past the leaders a sixteenth out under only a light drive. EMMA AND I prompted NO DOWN DAYS from outside, bid in
earnest past the midway point on the far turn, fought through a long drive and dug in to get the place. PERFECT KIMBERLY S was strung out four wide on
the turns, loomed outside the leaders at the top of the stretch, but weakened leaving the furlong grounds. NO DOWN DAYS set the pace inside for nearly
six furlongs, battled on against several challengers into the stretch, but gave way in the late stages. SUNNYMEDE DREAM saved ground to the far turn in
the second flight, moved out for the drive and could not muster the needed closing response. KISSING FROGS advanced to contention between horses
three wide after six furlongs, but could not sustain the rally. DANZATALE was forwardly placed early inside, and faded after six furlongs.

Footnotes
WINDY CITY RED was ridden along in close contention of the early leader, put to pressure three wide around the turn, stayed on determinedly through the
lane and powered past AWESOME PUDDING in the final sixteenth. AWESOME PUDDING broke on top and dictated the early pace along the inside then
held firm racing through the turn, responded and held clear into the final furlong then got outkicked in deep stretch. MARKET CAP was a step slow at the
start then chased inside through early stages, hustled along three wide into the upper stretch, sustained steady response and prevailed for a share.
POLITICAL RIOT bumped with rival at the start and tracked in contention along the rail, was ridden along the inside into the lane, sustained bid to
mid-stretch then flattened out. CREATIVE CLOUD raced three to four wide off the early pace, came out wider into the lane and lacked a needed rally.
JEALOUS BOYFRIEND bumped with rival at the start, chased the top trio along the outside, was ridden along four wide around the turn then gave way.
PACIFIC LEGEND raced five wide and failed to move into contention.

prompted the pace two wide, took a narrow lead between rivals near the five-sixteenths marker, vied inside of the winner past the eighth pole, could not
match strides from there but outdueled a foe for the place. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT stumbled at the start, saved ground off the pace, advanced three wide
between rivals around the far turn, angled back to the rail turning for home, bid inside of the top two near the eighth pole but was outfinished. RIVETING
SPIRIT had some speed between foes, rated back entering the first turn, raced two wide around that bend, advanced five wide around the far turn but
evened out in the lane. FEETS OF FEATHER steadied at the start, trailed inside, went four wide around the far turn and improved position in the lane.
LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN saved ground in range early, advanced four wide between foes around the far turn and failed to sustain the bid in the lane.
STARSHIP NANA was in range inside and had no response. ISLA BONITA advanced five wide to the lead, cleared and angled in midway around the first

STARTING UP vied early inside LEE ANN'S WARRIOR, took back letting the latter go early on the turn, moved out and around to rebid approaching the
stretch, gained command through the furlong grounds and drove clear. CACHETON tracked outside the leaders three wide to the stretch, and finished
willingly. BLANK'S HAT TRICK was outsprinted early, swung four wide leaving the turn, and rallied mildly outside the top two. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR vied
early outside STARTING UP, pulled clear and moved inward on the turn, could not hold that rival off after straightening away for the drive, and weakened on
the rail. AWKWARD PAUSE lagged well back three wide to the stretch, and passed tired horses. BOUND LUCKY bumped with HUNTER at the start, raced
close up early inside, and faded before reaching the stretch. PHILZANO raced two to three wide, and tired after three furlongs. SLIGHTLY FROSTED was
no factor four wide. HUNTER took the worst of a bump with BOUND LUCKY at the break to spot the field a couple lengths, and never got close.
