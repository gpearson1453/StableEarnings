Footnotes
WIN FOR GOLD hustled from the gate, vied briefly with a pair before prompting the pace of TOMMY GUN from the outside three wide, advanced to duel
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three then two wide straightened away into upper stretch taking over the front, edged
away under a drive kept to task. KAZMIKE hustled from the start, vied briefly with a pair before chasing two then three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and offered up a mild bid. OUSTER struck the near side stall at the start, chased four then three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. TOMMY GUN hustled
from the gate, vied briefly with a pair before tucking along the inside to show the way in sole command under some pressure from WIN FOR GOLD to the
outside, had that rival advanced and knocked heads through the turn while just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into
upper stretch and was headed for the front, weakened in the late stages. SCHERZANDO bumped at the start by MAJOR SPIN, chased five wide under
coaxing from midway on the turn, continued five wide into upper stretch and made no headway. MAJOR SPIN broke in at the start bumping the
aforementioned foe, chased four wide under a ride from three furlongs out, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened. BUILT TO LAST three
then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. CIVIL SERVICE hustled from
the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths growing detached at the tail of the field, went four wide into upper stretch well
behind and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
AMOUNT showed good speed on the outside, inherited a clear advantage when MUCHO SUNSHINE lost action and leapt nearing the seven-eighths,
passed the half-mile pole under urging while under pressure, was ridden along in the two path around the turn, shook off two foes outside the furlong
marker, drew off while kept to the task into the final seventy yards then was eased up late while much the best. CORKMAN settled on the outside, stalked
five wide early on the turn then dropped to the four path, was given his cue inside the three-eighths, chased outside into upper stretch, pursued the winner
under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. MAJESTIC TIGER angled out during the opening furlong, was coaxed
along just off the pace, moved up to make a bid before the half-mile pole, vied in the four then three path on the turn, was roused for more at the
five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under the crop, dropped back into the final furlong and tired while able to get the show. BINGO JOHN settled just
off the pace, dropped back under urging while saving ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out in the final furlong and came up
empty. MUCHO SUNSHINE came away in front, shied and lost action briefly early then leapt and lost action significantly just before the seven-eighths,
moved outside the leader shortly thereafter then chased, dropped back three wide leaving the backstretch, moved to five wide midway through the turn,
continued five wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
TELLAPERFECTTALE showed good speed on the inside of multiple foes, vied inside on the turn, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole, drew off under the
crop into the final furlong then was placed under a hand-ride while widening and much the best.. BOSS CARA dropped off the early pace then came under
urging, saved ground while ridden along on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and just got up for the place while no match for the winner. TO A
T bobbled while losing her footing just after the start then dropped back, spotted the front a couple lengths, was urged along off the pace, went two to three
wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and just missed the place while able to get the show. CADEAU DE PAIX was hustled from the gate, showed
speed then dropped just off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch and weakened. STENCIL showed good
speed between foes then disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path around the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired. WICKED HAPPY
dropped back quickly on the outside, went around the turn in the five path, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. HEY MAMA was hustled from
the start, showed speed on the outside then chased the pace, dropped back in the three path around the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and
capitulated.

Footnotes
STATE PLANNING coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive rallying to get up in the final jumps and prevail. PINEAPPLE MAN bobbled at the break, established the front and showed the way in hand
along the inside under pressure from a pair, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, edged away to the
eighth pole, dug in and was caught in the late stages while well clear for the place honors. CONVERTIBLE FREEZE hustled from the gate, prompted the
leader from the outside four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the final
furlong. MO DANCIN six paths off the inside early on, tucked three wide five furlongs from home before making his way to the rail into the turn, came under
coaxing three furlongs out, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. ACHILLES HEEL bobbled at the break, chased three then two wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. EDDIE THE GREAT coaxed from the start, prompted the leader between
foes from the two path under coaxing from midway on the turn, got shaken off near the quarter pole and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, then
tired in the drive. CUT THE CORD hustled from the gate, chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, tipped six wide into upper stretch and was
eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
BRONX BOMBER angled in while going to the front then moved clear with five furlongs to run, controlled the action along the rail around the turn, extended
the advantage in the two path into upper stretch, drew off into the final furlong, remained well clear while shortening stride into the final sixteenth and held
sway under steady urging. SICILIA MIKE was hustled from the start then came inward before steadying very briefly, dropped well back under urging, moved
from the three path to the five path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished with good energy to get the place. MONEY IN THE
BANK was urged along towards the front, went around the turn in the three path, pursued the winner in the stretch and finished willingly for the show.
GANDY DANCING was asked leaving the gate then coaxed along on the outside, went four wide around the turn, drifted out some near the furlong marker
and lacked the needed response. DURKIN'S CALL was a bit reluctant to load then broke a half-step slow, was urged along towards the rear, saved ground
on the turn and failed to threaten. BAD GUY was last to commence, raced at the rear of the field, saved ground while inside to the two path on the turn,
swung five wide into the stretch and was no factor. SOUTH AFRICA chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back three wide on the turn and
retreated. DOUBLE VISION showed early speed then dropped back near the five-eighths, moved to the outside of the leader, came up empty on the turn
and faltered.

Footnotes
ROSSA VELOCE three wide in pursuit just off the top pair, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch advancing to take
command with three-sixteenths to go, then edged clear under a drive to prevail. ROYAL MEGHAN prompted the pace just off the inside coming under
coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, took over narrow and brief command swinging three to four wide into upper stretch, got displaced from command at
the three-sixteenths and kept on clear of the rest to preserve the place honors. HALO CITY chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. LETMETAKETHISCALL showed the way in
hand along the inside under pressure from the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch and weakened. BETSY BLUE chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off
the inside for home and weakened. BOURBON REBELLION stumbled badly at the start falling to her face and lost the rider as a result, got apprehended by
the outrider after the finish and walked off under her own power. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start focusing on BOURBON REBELLION before
the result stood and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
BOOM BOOM KABOOM chased the pace down the backstretch, made a bid in the two to three path on the turn, took the lead under a drive in upper stretch
and drew away under strong urging. CROSTATA B C went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside to the two path on the turn, lost
the advantage in upper stretch, moved out while dropping back at the furlong marker then bothered a foe at that point and weakened but held the place.
TIMMY ME BOY showed speed then chased the pace, shifted from the rail to the two path on the turn, moved out while dropping back in upper stretch and
tired but earned third. EL VEINTICUATRO bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along off the pace, went around most of the turn in the two path then
shifted four wide, spun six wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and failed to rally. BOINTHEBACK was urged along on the outside,
went three then four wide on the turn and came up empty. LIMIT UP was bumped on both sides at the start then in tight between foes, raced off the pace
under urging, went four wide around the turn, drifted in some near the furlong marker then steadied when CROSTATA B C came out at that juncture and
had nothing left. MY INSPIRATION broke in and bumped hard with a foe which caused a chain bumping reaction to his inside, was urged along off the pace,
went three wide for most of the turn then was carried five wide, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. COURT BANKER was bumped hard at
the start and forced into another foe then taken up while squeezed, angled in at the rear, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. C. B
LOVES A FIGHT was bumped hard at the start and forced strongly into another rival then checked while pinched back, raced inside to the two path on the
turn and never reached contention. MOONS THE LIMIT broke in at the start, was urged along off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, saved
ground on the turn and retreated. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF LIMIT UP AND A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, CROSTATA B C WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED SIXTH FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE EIGHTH-POLE
