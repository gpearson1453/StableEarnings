Footnotes
ERNIE BANKER in the second flight off the inside, came three wide out of the turn, collared the leaders with less than a furlong remaining, drew well clear
late. INCORRUPTIBLE away in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, headed nearing midstretch, proved no match for the winner late, regained
the place spot while fully extended. SHACKS WAY broke toward the front, dueled off the inside, put a head in front past the furlong marker, also could not
contain the winner in the final sixteenth, outfinished for the second spot. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK in the second group inside the winner, roused for the
drive, shifted out a bit but lacked a significant closing response. TERAWATT off a step slow, raced well back inside, was never dangerous after moving out
for the drive. RIFT VALLEY lacked speed while lacking speed between rivals, failed to respond in the drive as well. WISE KHOZAN finished early while
racing three wide.

Footnotes
HARDLY A SECRET unhurried for five furlongs, moved strongly to the front while three wide and between rivals turning for home, quickly clear, won geared
down to win ridden out. EAGLE PASS in tight at the start, raced well back for five furlongs as well, fanned six wide into the lane, rallied for the place while
not a threat to the winner. KIERKEGAARD away in good order, dueled up front along the inside, held a slight advantage late in the final turn, offered little
resistance to the winner when that one took over into the lane, chased that same rival past the furlong marker, caught late for the place. THAT'S WHAT I
SAY lacked speed, encountered some traffic in the far turn off the inside, was floated five wide into the stretch, displayed a mild amount of late interest.
SPLASH FOR GOLD brushed at the start, settled in mid pack while toward the inside, continued in the two path into the far turn, moved inside midway on
the final bend, lacked a serious closing response when called on for the drive. SLICK SILVER off the pace and the inside, four out to five wide in the second
turn, lacked a rally. GAMBLER raced in the second flight while off the inside, had little left for the drive. PRIVATE LAKE four wide in the first turn when with
the main body, continued outside, weakened through the stretch. KING FORD brush at the start, raced back off the pace and the inside, two path second
bend, failed to muster a rally. JACK'S ADVANTAGE dueled up front off the inside, continued to alternate up front the middle half, gave way turning for
home. ANDREAS off a step slow, dropped inside to save ground, was never a factor. KNIGHT'S CROSS in the second flight while moving just off the inside
first turn, stopped second turn, jogged in.

ONE FOR RICHIE never far back off the inside, three wide into the turn, challenged outside the leader soon after, shook clear when straightened for home,
held the runner up comfortably safe under steady handling. DON'T FORGET in mid pack toward the inside early, encountered some traffic when moving
somewhat closer midway on the turn, steered out for the drive, slowly getting to the winner, clearly second best. MR. ANKENY broke sharp, set the pace,
briefly responded when the winner challenged late in the turn then began to weaken, continued gradually falter down the lane, saved the show. PRESS
SNOOZE last away, trailed just off the inside, remained in the two path through the turn, improved down the lane without posing a serious threat. TAPPIN
FORA DANCE forwardly place for a half off the inside, three wide into the lane, had little left for the run to the wire. WIN WITH PRIDE well back off the pace
while in the three path through the turn, failed to rally. WRONGWAYHIGHWAY saved ground to no avail. BACHELOR PAD within striking distance outside,
four wide through the turn, tired. SEAU five wide trip throughout, trailed home.

Footnotes
CONNIE K with the pace after breaking alertly, in the two path into the turn, dropped to the rail soon after, held a narrow advantage into the lane,disposed of
the other speed in upper stretch, enough left to hold the runner up narrowly safe in the waning strides. UNBRIDLED TWISTER with the early inside the
winner and along the rail up the backstretch, shuffled back into the turn, moved out and was four wide turning for home losing ground to the winner, roused,
rapidly getting to that rival late, well clear of the others. TOO PRETTY forwardly placed the opening quarter on the outside, four wide into the turn, vied three
wide through the latter part of the bend, could not match the winner in the drive nor contain the runner up, narrowly saved the show. RICHNESS in mid pack
early toward the rail, moved out three wide through the bend, went one paced through the lane to improve position slightly. KABOOM BABY off a step slow,
raced back and outside, came five wide when off the pace turning for home, lacked a closing response. HILLARY G with the pace outside the winner,
between horses through the turn, faltered when the real running began at the head of the lane. STARRGARITA off a step slow, lacked speed in the two
path, was not involved in the drive. LADY ASTRID fell back to trail soon after the start, three wide turn, also was always outrun.

Footnotes
COLE SPUR with the pace from the start, vied between horses through the turn, put a head in front when straightened for home, slight drift under a brisk left
handed crop past the furlong marker, was straightened and kicked well clear under continued encouragement. OILER lacked early foot well out in the strip,
four wide through most of the turn, swung five wide into the lane, finished full of run to be in time for the place. UNCAPTURED DREAM showed the way up
the backstretch, continued to hold the advantage through the turn inside, could not match the winner in weakening past the furlong marker, caught for the
place late, just lasted for the show. TREATY off step slow, moved up behind the leaders off the inside, continued behind traffic late in the turn, steered out
sharply nearing the furlong grounds to bother a couple of outer rivals, finished with some late energy to improve position. WESLEYAN forwardly placed
outside, pressed the issue while three wide through the turn, gradually weakened down the lane. ARISTOCAT settled in mid pack, in some traffic late
backstretch, raced in the two path through the turn, came up empty for the drive. PUBLIC RECORD saved ground to no avail. DRIVEN ONE behind the
pace while racing three wide, faltered in the drive. POPSTER finished early with a four wide trip.

Footnotes
HOME BASE never far back outside, ranged up to challenge four wide midway on the turn, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, edged clear
under firm handling. ATOKA off the pace well out in the strip, four wide through the turn, briskly set down for the drive, willingly for the place. MOJO MAN
behind the pace while racing inside, continued to save ground turn, crept a bit closer past midstretch then flattened out a bit the final sixteenth. MUCH
BETTER moved up to take control soon after the start inside, showed the way through the turn, two path into the lane, weakened gradually from between
horses. SEVEN NATION ARMY within striking distance off the inside, challenged three wide and inside the winner midway on the turn, had little left late.
LYKAN last to leave, lacked a bid while racing in the two path. WHISKEY DOUBLE fell back to trail after the start, was never involved. TOPPER T
pressured the pace in the two path for a half and began to give way.

Footnotes
GAR HOLE away best of all, pressed the early leader off the inside and in hand, took over under his own courage turning for home, quickly clear upper
stretch, shaken up a bit nearing the furlong marker then was geared down late as much the best. SOUIXPER CHARGER settled off the pace and the inside,
tipped out to be three wide and behind the winner exiting the turn, could do little with that foe in chasing past the furlong marker, enough left to hold the
place position. BANDIT POINT lacked speed toward the inside for the opening quarter, worked way out to be three wide turning for home while racing in
some traffic, continued with resolve to the finish to be gaining on the runner up. MRS. BEANS off a step slow and then veered into the gap, was sluggish
early to trail well back, closer three wide late turn,improved through traffic late. K J'S NOBILITY dropped to the inside, saved ground in mid pack through the
turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a late punch. TEMPT FATE forwardly placed for a half while racing in the two path, had little for the drive.
YOUNG BULL in mid pack outside, four out to five wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. BIG SUCCESS remained always back while racing just off
the inside. BLAME J D moved up to set the pace along the inside, caved when displaced by the winner entering the stretch. REEF'S DESTINY in mid pack
for a half outside, four wide through the turn, gave way in the drive. PER RULING DATED 3/27/2022 RECEIVED FROM THE ARKANSAS STATE RACING
COMMISSION (RULING #2022-OP-22), SOUIXPER CHARGER WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
BEGUINE broke alertly, clear into the first turn, rated kindly in the run up the backstretch, breather into the far turn, stayed clear in the drive while drifting out
a bit late. STAR TABLE off the pace while racing well out in the strip, was four wide into the far turn,advanced through that bend to chased the winner into
the lane, could do little with that one the final furlong, clearly second best. MADELYN'S MAGIC lacked speed, advanced while three wide through much of
the second turn, flattened out past the furlong marker to finish clear of the rest, no match for the top two. RUN THE TAP off a step slow, off pace, traffic late
backstretch, asked along, improved 2nd turn, also failed to sustain that advance in the drive. EMITYAAZ hesitated at the start, trailed for five furlongs,
swung four wide into the lane, improved upper stretch and also flattened out in the final furlong. BELLA RUNNER chased the winner early off the inside,
three wide into the far turn, faltered. DECADE OF DREAMS a bit rank in traffic in the first turn, moved up to chase the winner up the backstretch, began to
tire in the far turn. MIDNIGHT MISTRESS was finished after a half, well beaten in trailing home. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION.
