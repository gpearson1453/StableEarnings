Footnotes
YOU'RE KILLIN ME settled off the early pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, made a steady gain outside, took over nearing the sixteenth pole
and drove clear. TIGER set the pace in the two path, was headed near the five-sixteenths pole, regained command in upper stretch, led between foes to the
sixteenth marker and stayed on to hold second. TWICE TOO MANY stalked the pace from the rail, got through smoothly in upper stretch, bid at the rail
nearing the eighth pole but was outfinished from there. AMPERSAND broke a bit awkwardly, raced well back down the backstretch, moved up five wide
around the turn and finished well widest. HANDSOME PRINCE raced two and three wide between foes in midpack and lacked the needed stretch rally. OLD
TIME REVIVAL pressed the pace in the three path, took a short lead near the five-sixteenths pole, vied to midstretch and tired through the final furlong.
JESS'S STRIDE was up close two wide and faded in the lane. FRIENDLY FELLA failed to menace while racing four wide. THE ICE BEAST played no factor
while racing three wide. FAST LOADED chased three wide and was through after a half. BAILEY was outrun inside. AWESOME BEACH had brief speed
inside.

Footnotes
VETERANS HIGHWAY vied outside of OLGA ISABEL in the early going, dueled around the turn, held a slight edge turning for home, drifted out wider,
came under right handed pressure, challenged by FALCONET in late stages, dug in gamely and held on. FALCONET was forwardly placed and three wide
around the turn, shifted out wider to move up outside the leader in the stretch run, stayed on gamely, was edging up on winner in final strides and just
missed. SILVERLEAF raced off the pace near the inside, was ridden along three to four wide into the upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and finished well
clear for a share. OLGA ISABEL vied for the early racing inside of VETERANS HIGHWAY, battled with the eventual winner around the turn then tired in the
drive. INVITING got shuffled back a bit and lost path at the start, chased near midpack, came three wide into the lane and lacked the needed response for
late impact. TIFFANY'S MO raced two to three wide off the early speed, saved ground into the lane and lacked a needed rally. LOVE TO RUN angled to the
inside in opening stages, chased the top trio into the turn, came two wide into the lane and faded. TEQUILERA raced four to five wide in or near the back,
came five wide into the lane and never menaced. BLINI raced off the early pace five paths wide, came three wide into the upper stretch and failed to move
into contention. TACHLIS showed response in the opening quarter then steadily faded. PELIGROSO raced five wide off the early pace and dropped far
back.

MIRA MISSION saved ground unhurried early, began moving around the far turn while guided out and around rivals, fanned five wide into the stretch, rallied
determinedly outside MOUILLAGE and wore that one down in the closing stages. MOUILLAGE (FR) broke flat-footed at the back, went along in the
two-path reserved to the far turn, swung four wide getting his cue after six furlongs, forged to the front outside NOBLE INDY with an eighth of a mile
remaining, stayed on his left lead and could not withstand the top one late. ENGLISH BEE hugged the rail to the far turn within range, came two wide into
the lane, stayed on his left lead and did enough to get up for the show. NOBLE INDY tracked outside the pacesetters three wide, reached a brief lead
turning for home, then gave way through the furlong grounds. NEVER SURPRISED was outsprinted to the top by CLEAR VISION and fought rating early,
lodged a mild bid between horses on the far turn, but was finished by upper stretch. CLEAR VISION set the pace inside for six furlongs, and folded up once
displaced for command. SIGILOSO dropped far back inside after six furlongs, and was vanned off after the finish. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
FELIX settled in range widest down the backstretch, bid three wide around the turn, took the lead nearing the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear turning into the
lane, continued on the left lead to deep stretch and lasted. CREATIVE MINISTER raced off the early pace inside, angled four wide leaving the
five-sixteenths marker, surged outside, switched back the left lead in deep stretch and just missed. MASTER OF ARMS raced three wide in midpack and
stayed on to gain the show. POSITIVE REVIEW stalked the early pace between foes, bid two wide into the turn, led between nearing the three-eighths pole,
could not match strides with the winner nearing the lane and weakened. HIDDEN PLAN failed to menace while racing four wide. WINSTON BLUE played no
factor while racing two wide. MENDENHALL dwelt, raced five wide around the turn and was never a threat. PARTICULAR broke inwardly and slowly,
advanced inside down the backstretch, made some progress two wide around the turn and faltered nearing the lane. TOWN BRANCH was up close inside
down the backstretch and retreated around the turn. SUPER QUALITY sped to the front, set the pace along the rail and stopped after a half. VILLEGAS
SWING had only brief speed two wide.

VIRGINIA JOY (GER) was well rated two to three wide under a snug hold in early stages, edged up a bit closer late on the final turn then swung five wide,
given cue approaching the furlong marker, rallied along the outside while shifting in a couple paths and edged away. FAMILY WAY was forwardly placed in
the early stages and stalked the leader up the backstretch, launched a bid midway around the final turn, dueled outside of BEAUTIFUL LOVER into the
lane, shook free to a slim lead in the final furlong then got outkicked by the winner. HARAJUKU (IRE) secured inside position and tracked the pace near
midpack, launched a two wide bid late on the final turn, shifted three wide for a clear path in the upper stretch and sustained a solid bid. BEAUTIFUL
LOVER cleared and crossed over soon after the start and set the pace through early stages, took on the challenge from FAMILY WAY mid-way through the
final turn, battle for the lead into the final furlong then gave way. SORREL (IRE) was reserved racing in the back, tucked inside for the final turn, shifted out
three to four wide in the upper stretch and had a mild improve. MEZCAL was nicely rated near midpack through middle stages, launched a three wide bid
with a quarter-mile remaining, raced up close then weakened in the lane. ONYX settled off the early pace, chased two to three wide around the final turn
and failed to move on. KELSEY'S CROSS got in tight along the rail and steadied sharply in opening stages, settled off the pace saving ground, was under a
ride two to three wide into the upper stretch and had no response. QUINEVERE (GER) raced in close contention and stalked inside up the backstretch then
came up empty around the final turn. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE

Footnotes
KATHLEEN O. was slowest into stride and allowed to settle, took closer order after six furlongs shifting out to the three-path behind horses, tipped further
out for clearance into the stretch, responded readily to overtake the leaders from outside and drove clear. CLASSY EDITION saved ground in the second
flight to the turn, had the two-path into the stretch and went past a spent GIRL WITH A DREAM, moved back to the rail with a solid response but could not
match the winner's late kick. COCKTAIL MOMENTS raced four wide around the turn, could not seriously menace but was up outside SWEET DANI GIRL to
snag the show. SWEET DANI GIRL went up to engage the leaders three wide into the turn, fought her way to a short lead in the two-path after six furlongs,
stayed on to the furlong grounds and gave way. OUTFOXED advanced after a half-mile, bid three wide coming to the five-sixteenths pole, but had nothing
left in the final furlong. GIRL WITH A DREAM contested the pace between MI NEGRITA and SWEET DANI GIRL into the turn, and had nothing left in upper
stretch. MI NEGRITA moved inward with the lead up the backstretch, was hard-pressed by GIRL WITH A DREAM and SWEET DANI GIRL after a half-mile,
stopped on the turn, and jogged in.

Footnotes
COINAGE was in range inside while a bit rank around the first turn, continued to save ground around the far turn, swung four wide in upper stretch, bid
outside of foes near the eighth pole, vied three deep to deep stretch and inched ahead. MAIN EVENT settled off the early pace three wide, bid three deep
midway around the far turn, vied between foes through the lane, was brushed by a drifting BUENO BUENO late and just missed in a game try. BUENO
BUENO set the pace along the rail, fought on inside of foes to deep stretch, drifted out late and made light contact with MAIN EVENT and settled for the
show. RED DANGER raced off the pace two wide around the first turn and three wide around the far turn, swung further out in upper stretch and rallied.
SOSUA SUMMER was in range four wide around both turns and lacked a rally. CREDIBILITY broke awkwardly but quickly, saved ground off the pace and
never threatened. C MY MEISTER was off a bit and was outrun inside. MOMS MOON stalked the pace two wide, bid between foes midway around the far
turn and tired in the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

PREVALENCE was prompted into a forward placed in opening stages and applied pace pressure to LIAM, edged past aforementioned rival and dueled
inside of SOUP AND SANDWICH at the quarter pole, shook free into the stretch and finished going away. CHOCOLATE BAR tracked the pace along the
inside up the backstretch, launched a bid mid-way around the turn, remained in pursuit of the winner through the lane and gathered place. SOUP AND
SANDWICH stalked three to four wide through early stages, loomed up to duel with PREVALANCE approaching the quarter pole, could not match strides
with winner at the head of the lane but ran on and secured a share. AWESOME GERRY raced off the early pace, was ridden along four wide around the
turn, came five wide into the upper stretch and produced a mild bid. STAGE RAIDER stumbled at the start then got shuffled back and dropped to last, was
ridden along six wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. LIAM set a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead into the turn then came up empty
near the quarter pole. KING'S OVATION settled three wide off the early pace and had no response when called upon near the three-eighths pole. MANOR
HOUSE got shuffled back shortly after the start, raced off the pace along the outside and failed to move into contention. HIDE THE DEMON raced in
contention up the backstretch then came up empty entering the turn.

IN ITALIAN (GB) took control soon after the start, rated along in the two-path to the stretch, responded to pressure and remained clear. WAKANAKA (IRE)
settled in midpack two wide for six furlongs, moved out a bit for the drive and finished well. NAVRATILOVA tugged along close up and three wide early,
lodged a bid outside IN ITALIAN with a quarter-mile remaining, could not reach the leader and was outfinished for second. SUGAR FIX raced three wide
around the far turn, and offered a mild response to improve without threatening. JOUSTER raced close up inside to the stretch, and weakened. ALMS
lagged well back early, went four wide on the far turn, and made no impact. BIPARTISANSHIP (GB) was no factor inside. GIFT LIST (GB) was always
outrun. LOVELY LUVY was slow into stride, and stayed well back two wide. KATAMA MOONLIGHT was no factor three wide. QUINOA TIFAH prompted the
early pace outside IN ITALIAN, and retired approaching the stretch. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

SPEAKER'S CORNER brushed the starting gate and was off a bit slowly, advanced inside down the chute, took over leaving the three-quarters marker, set
the pace along the rail, shook clear nearing the quarter pole, drifted out a bit while drawing off in upper stretch and widened through the lane. FEARLESS
settled off the pace inside, advanced at the rail under urging around the turn, swung out in upper stretch, had aim on the winner but was no match for that
foe while staying on to be a clear second. ENDORSED advanced between foes down the backstretch, pressed the winner two wide around the turn, could
not keep pace from the quarter pole but churned on to best the rest. DIAMOND OOPS raced off the early pace, advanced two and three wide between foes
around the turn to reach contention nearing the lane then flattened out. NY TRAFFIC had early speed outside, dropped back after a quarter, chased two
wide around the turn and lacked a rally. INJUNCTION led early, chased the winner in the four path around the turn and tired in the lane. COLLABORATE
was in range while racing five wide and came up empty in the lane. BOURBON WAR was outrun inside.

TEMPLE settled nicely tracking the pace just out of striking distance in early stages, continued to track in hand through the backstretch, prompted to clear
the advantage mid-way around the final turn, drifted out wider heading into the lane and held clear under a driving finish. SHAMROCKET rated through early
stages and raced five paths wide through the backstretch, loomed up to issue a challenge late on the final turn, got carried five wide into the upper stretch,
sustained solid response for the winner and cleared the rest. MEDIA BLITZ raced near midpack through the backstretch, was ridden along three wide
around the final turn, stayed on four wide past the furlong marker and prevailed for a share. ABAAN steadied around the first turn and lost position in
opening stages then settled inside through early stages, prompted and responded to loom closer late on the far turn, sustained a three wide bid in the upper
stretch then flattened out. FANTASIOSO (ARG) raced near midpack through early stages, roused two wide into the upper stretch and lacked the needed
response for late impact. GLOUCESTERSHIRE was reserved in the back, was ridden along four wide into the upper stretch and had a mild improve.
GLYNN COUNTY tracked the pace along the inside, continued in contention two wide through the final turn then weakened in the lane. TIDE OF THE SEA
was forwardly placed in opening stages and stalked the early pacesetter, dueled with SAFE CONDUCT through the backstretch, briefly held the lead the got

and had no response. KYGO (GER) steadied sharply along the inside around the first turn, raced off the pace and failed to move into contention. SAFE
CONDUCT set the pace through early stages, dueled through the backstretch then faded around the final turn. RACE WAS HAND TIMED, RUN UP

Footnotes
SIMPLIFICATION settled in midpack within range early, circled up six wide to join a gaggle of horses contesting the front late on the far turn, wrested
command through upper stretch and kicked away staying on his left lead. IN DUE TIME was never far back while two to three wide in the second flight, split
horses brushing with A. P.'S SECRET rallying past the quarter-pole, altered further out through upper stretch and finished well. O CAPTAIN was slow into
stride, fanned four wide beginning to find stride approaching the stretch, and rallied mildly. EMMANUEL was strung out five wide early, advanced still well
out in the track after six furlongs, but could not sustain the rally. DEAN DELIVERS pressed the pace outside MARKAMIAN early, reached a short lead after
six furlongs, and stayed on to midstretch before giving way. RATTLE N ROLL was slow into stride, saved ground and failed to become a factor. A. P.'S
SECRET raced close up three wide, made some contact with IN DUE TIME and HIGH OAK in close quarters late on the far turn, had his heels clipped by
the latter just past the quarter-pole and dropped back. MARKHAMIAN set the pace inside for nearly six furlongs, and steadily gave way. HOWLING TIME
never reached contention. HIGH OAK raced four wide, was contesting the front in tight quarters and made some contact with A. P.'S SECRET, clipped that
one's heels and fell just past the quarter-pole, regained his feet and was apprehended and escorted off. GALT raced four wide, leapt over a fallen rival past
the quarter-pole unseating the rider, was apprehended and escorted off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE SPILL BEFORE THE RESULT
WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

the start, raced well back two and three wide and finished strongly to narrow much of the gap. MISCHIEVOUS KISS chased the winner from the rail, angled
three wide near the quarter pole, drifted in then out in the stretch and stayed on to hold third. LAST LEAF saved ground well back, tipped out in upper
stretch and improved her position. LIA MARINA gave distant chase three wide and lacked a rally. BESIDE HERSELF saved ground to no avail. BALI DEL
SOL failed to menace while racing three wide. LEMIEUX pressed the winner two wide and retreated through the lane. DIA DE SOL hit the starting gate,
raced two and three wide and made little impact. HOWDYOUMAKEURMONEY bumped with OPALINA at the start, raced three and four wide and never
threatened. SOUL OF AN ANGEL was off slow and trailed inside. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
