Footnotes
OUTCOME never far back off the inside, advanced to challenge three wide turn, dueled into the lane, kicked well clear the final furlong while being kept to
pressure. FREER with the pace up the backstretch along the inside, vied through the turn, dueled in the two path and inside the winner entering the stretch,
proved no match for that one the final furlong, caught in the final strides for the second spot. RISKY SITUATION raced in mid pack early just off the inside,
came three wide out of the turn, altered course sharply to the outside in upper stretch, finished willingly while well out in the strip to be in time for the place.
HARRY in the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground into the lane, had little left for the drive in finishing up evenly. MOUNTAIN PINE off a
step slow, lacked early foot, came four wide into the stretch, improved position while not a serious threat. JUSTDENNIS void of speed, saved ground
through the turn, improved slightly while also not a serious threat. BLUES TUNE raced back off the pace outside, four wide through the turn, made little
impact through the stretch. GLASSATO raced briefly forward, began to fade before a half. LOOKIN GOOD SO FAR away in good order, dueled up front
outside the runner up into the turn, gave way into the stretch, drifted out then lugged in nearing the furlong marker, continued to falter. RAZOR RAY off a
step slow, remained always back. CONFESS in mid pack early off the inside, steadily faded.

Footnotes
SCHMOOZE four wide into the first turn, angled in a bit midway on that bend to save some ground, stalked up the backstretch, ranged up four wide to
challenge into the lane, gained the advantage, responded and dug in late to refuse to let the runner up by. DECLARE THE MOON raced back off the early
pace toward the inside, moved closer three wide late in the second turn, shifted outside the winner when straightened for home, late bid, could not get by.
SUEZ set or forced the pace while between rivals, continued to vie second turn, gradually weakened through the stretch while comfortably saving the show.
DRIVEN ONE with the pace along the inside, also steadily weakened through the lane. PINCH HITTER pressed the pace while racing three wide, gave way
in the drive as well. JACKPOT BOY off a step slow, trailed most of the way and was never a factor. PRACTICAL MAN within striking distance outside, four
wide into the lane, began to back up soon after.

Footnotes
LONELY PRIVATE broke alertly, sprinted clear up the backstretch, shrugged off a rival late in the turn, clear again stretch, kept to task. CAPTURE THE
GLORY in tight start, closest to the leader off the inside, moved a bit closer late in the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, remained clear for
the place. GAMBLER steadied just after the start, back off the pace well out in the strip, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, staged a mild rally toward
the inside to be in time for the show. WHENTHEDOVESCRY within striking distance outside, continued to race forwardly out of the turn, came up empty for
the stretch run, caught late for the show. SEEK N JUSTICE reserved and off the pace while in some traffic entering the turn, asked midway on the turn, four
to five wide in the turn, improved position. TRAPPE VALLEY off a step slow, trailed early, improved inside turn, flattened out drive. TIME HEIST in mid pack
early and just off the inside, failed to respond when set down for the drive. SMART TIME within striking distance early inside, began a steady retreat along
the rail before a half. BEBOP SHOES raced back and four wide early turn, eased soon after, jogged in, vanned off.

Footnotes
EPWORTH broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch, saw that lead diminish through the turn, two path into the lane, clear when straightened for
home, extended that advantage past the furlong marker, enough left late to last. JERI DAWN lacked speed well out in the strip, four wide into the turn, got
out and was in the six path exiting, late run to be rapidly getting to the winner late. CHAI TEA in the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground
turn, lacked a closing punch to finish up best of the rest while slowly closing the gap on the winner, no match runner up. MAZIE G chased early, with the
pace while between rivals and outside the winner through the turn, gradually weakened through the lane. HALF SCOUT void of speed inside, continued
along the rail through the turn when beginning to advance, continued to improve position in the drive. FIBRILLATOR broke back, raced three to four wide
through the turn, passed mostly tiring rivals in the stretch to also better her position. SAILAWAY AND HIDE forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch in
the two path, had little for the drive. ANGIE'S REVRAC failed to menace while racing just off the inside. CALICO TABBY four wide when in mid pack into the
turn, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. LIL' BIT OF CHROME off a step slow, remained always back. HOLLYSROYALDEFENSE with the
pace outside, four path through the turn, gave way in the drive. KENKEAD was finished before a half, well back.

Footnotes
SPARTY SENSE narrowly showed the way up the backstretch inside, continued to set the pace turn, responded when challenged by a second foe nearing
midstretch, dug in late and refused to let that rival by while holding the runner up safe in the final strides. ACEHIGH ROYAL void of speed off the inside,
began to advance early turn, dropped to the inside by late in the bend, moved back out for the drive, finished willingly to be in time for the place and was
getting to the winner late. SINNER'S SIN broke back, moved up inside to within striking distance, two path when moving to challenge upper stretch, drifted
out, caught late for the place. RARE STRIPE void of speed just off the inside, continued in the two path through the turn, improved position in the drive while
not a threat to the top three. BOAT SONG broke back, moved outside and was four wide into the turn, three wide exiting when in some traffic, lacked a
closing kick. K C ROCKET in mid pack early off the inside, five wide turning for home, went evenly through the stretch. ONYOURMARKGETSETGO
forwardly placed while racing just off the inside, had little left for the stretch run. STAINLESS STEEL pressed the winner from the outside for a half then
gave way entering the stretch. ALPHA WHISKEY was finished early while racing four out to five wide in the turn.

Footnotes
FLATOUT WINNER tucked inside early in the first turn to save ground,continued along the inside up the backstretch, waited behind a rival into the far turn
while still inside, two path through much of that bend, split foes past the furlong marker and proved best in determined fashion. EKATI'S VERVE settled in
the second flight while off the inside, three wide through the final turn, briskly roused for the drive, challenged, outkicked by the winner late while edging
clear for the second spot. RESTORING HOPE with the pace into the first turn between horses, dueled onto the backstretch closest to but not on the rail,
continued to hold a narrow advantage through the second turn and upper stretch, faltered in the late going, lasted for the show. SPORTS FAN back off the
pace, continued back far turn, tipped our four wide turning for home, improved slightly the final furlong while flattening out a bit. SHOFAR with the leaders
into the first turn inside, maintained contact with the dueling pair the middle half, remained within striking distance into the stretch before coming up empty
for the stretch run. ENGLANDER broke on top, vied three wide early, dueled onto the backstretch while remaining in the three path, continued to duel into
the second turn, was beginning to tire when rider lost whip a furlong out, continued to weaken. CALL OF HONOR settled in mid pack, steered out and
ranged up closer four wide midway on the final turn, failed to sustain that advance in the stretch. GEORGIA DEPUTY last away, trailed for six furlongs, four
to five wide in the second turn, failed to rally. MAKE NOISE lacked speed, was four wide through the second turn, remained outrun through the lane.

Footnotes
GOALIE prompted the winner in the three path through the first turn,continued to prompt that one down the stretch the first time and into the second turn,
took over in the third bend, quickly clear after moving to the inside into the stretch, drew out while being kept to task. SCALES OF JUSTICE forwardly
placed along the inside, continued to save ground the middle six furlongs, moved out around the tiring leader in the third turn, was no match for the winner
through the stretch, clearly second best. HUNT THE FRONT void of speed for over a mile, picked off a couple of tiring rivals to prove best of the rest, no
threat to the top two. SUPER CONSTITUTION went one paced throughout while racing off the inside. TONALTALITARIAN settled off the pace, was finished
after nine furlongs. WARTIME HERO angled in to show the way in the two path, gave way when headed by the winner final turn. SPHEROID fell back after
start, sluggish, pulled up 2nd turn, walked, walked off. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND TIMED. FRACTIONS ADDED AND TIME

Footnotes
BRICE came in just after the start to bother a couple of rivals, was straightened and pressed the pace off the inside, continued to apply pressure up the
backstretch, engaged the leader far turn, dueled into the stretch and wore that rival down to kick clear late. GO FOR SHERRIE settled in the second flight
off the rail, came three wide and under pressure into the lane, closed with good resolve to be up for the place, not a threat to the winner. HOME RUN TRICK
broke on top, showed the way along the inside, responded when confronted by the winner final turn, dueled into the lane then faltered, caught late for the
place. VENTURE FORTH bothered at the start, settled in mid pack off the inside, raced three wide through the second turn, finished up evenly. DERBY
CODE lacked early foot, saved ground through both turns, improved slightly without posing a serious threat. INDIAN GULCH bothered and was bumped to
be off slowly, remained always back in failing to threaten. CASHANOVA bothered at the start, trailed far back early, passed tiring rivals while never a factor.
HEIRLOOM KITTEN broke in, bothered rival, raced in the second flight off the inside, gave way in the two path. RYE HUMOR in mid pack off the inside,
finished after five furlongs. GAGOOTS off slowly, was always outrun.
