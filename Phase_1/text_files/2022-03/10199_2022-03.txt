Footnotes
POWER BANKER broke in front, set all the pace and finished full of run under brisk handling to win going away. SHE'S CRAFTY checked along the rail in
the middle of both turn, shifted out to the four path entering the stretch and rallied for second. FLAXEN chased the winner from the four and three paths and
was outfinished for second. FRIDAY vied for the lead three wide into the far turn then faded. SILVER MAPLE settled outside and lacked the needed
response. JETTIN PEGASUS was no factor. KIST failed to menace. THE RIDER OF SHE'S CRAFTY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER
OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE FAR TURN. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF

Footnotes
GLACKEN'S CAUSE stalked the pace from the inside into the far turn. shifted out to the five path nearing the quarter pole, responded readily when set
down, made the lead a furlong out then widened the balance of the trip under strong handling to win as much the best. LIAM'S LASS stumbled out of the
gate, was unhurried, closed willingly through the stretch in the five path, was righted past the furlong marker after drifting in slightly then finished well clear
for second. ANDIAMA pressed the pace two wide for five furlongs, made the lead, quickly drew clear, set the pace until mid stretch then weakened late.
SWEET DEVIL failed to menace. ROSA'S SOUL away alertly, set the pace for five furlongs along the inside and gave way in the final furlong. SCHOOLED
was no factor. DANCE ON OVER trailed.

ARCHIE'S GIRL with the second flight two wide, closed steadily three wide in the five path through the stretch and was along in time. ANNMARIA rushed to
contention three wide, made the lead two wide entering the stretch, quickly shook clear then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. JILLY FROM
JERSEY vied for the lead along the inside into the stretch, shifted out to the five path then went evenly. BLACK BUTTE broke in front, set the pace to the
top of the stretch then weakened late. CHECK SIX trailed.
