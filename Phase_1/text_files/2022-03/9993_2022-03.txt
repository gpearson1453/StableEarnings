Footnotes
RAMBLIN' MAN settled at the rear early, began to gain inside approaching the half, took the lead inside of FAMOUS ROCK STAR at the quarter, continued
to lead while pursued by HEY PILGRIM down the lane, and narrowly held to the wire over that foe. HEY PILGRIM settled near the rear, improved four wide
from near the half mile mark, loomed four wide past the three eighths, continued to chase RAMBLIN' MAN down the lane while that pair separated from the
rest of the field, gained late on RAMBLIN' MAN but missed. FAMOUS ROCK STAR was sent between horses, led in the opening furlong, tracked three
deep after MYSTIC REALITY took the lead near the five eighths, engaged to vie outside of MYSTIC REALITY into the turn, led briefly again past the three
eighths while positioned three wide, was headed by RAMBLIN' MAN to his inside with a quarter mile remaining, pursued that foe and HEY PILGRIM in
upper stretch while proving no match, and held show. MOONLITE GRAHAM came away well but settled back to chase the leading trio, raced toward the
rear in the five path on the turn, and passed tiring horses under a drive in the lane. MYSTIC REALITY was sent inside for speed, set the pace while pressed
by FAMOUS ROCK STAR, vied with that foe into the turn, began to flatten out between horses from near the three eighths and continued to flatten in the
lane. SMOOTH PAPA attended the early pace between horses, began to flatten near the five furlong mark, raced with the trailing pair in the two path on the
turn and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
ARIZONA SUN tracked the pace outside of FOUNDATION early, encroached on the leader three wide into the turn, poked his head in front near the three
eighths, continued to vie three deep from there, went to a drive into the lane, took over for good approaching the eighth pole and held sway. BURNADEBT
chased well off the leading trio early while racing just outside of SUPAH SISTA, was urged outside of WHO B DAT on the turn while well behind the leading
trio, swung into the lane in the five path, rallied with good interest under a drive and got up for place inside the final sixteenth. FOUNDATION tracked the
pace inside of ARIZONA SUN, edged closer inside of pacesetter LAST PUNCH near the half mile mark, vied at the inside of the leading flight from near the
three eighths, continued to vie inside of ARIZONA SUN under a drive in upper stretch, proved no match nearing the eighth pole and flattened out. LAST
PUNCH set the pace down the backstretch, was engaged from both sides by FOUNDATION and ARIZONA SUN into the turn, was headed by ARIZONA
SUN near the three eighths but continued to vie between to the three sixteenths, proved no match from there and flattened out. WHO B DAT settled near
the rear outside of SHOE GAME, continued well off the pace on the turn, was driven into the lane in the three path and lacked the needed rally. SHOE
GAME settled at the rear inside, was driven inside into the lane and offered no bid. SUPAH SISTA chased well behind the tracking flight, was pushed along
into the turn, pulled up near the three eighths and was vanned off. A HEAD-ON VIDEO REPLAY WAS NOT AVAILABLE.

Footnotes
BIG BLUE NOTE soon led, set the pace while being pressed by SNOOZY SUZY past the half, continued to set a pressured pace in the two path on the turn,
shook away in upper stretch and proved much the best under a vigorous hand ride late. DATQUICKCAT was in tight between horses early, situated near
the rear while still hard to settle into the turn, raced near the rear in the three path on the turn, swung out into the eight path for the drive, sustained a rally
under a drive, proved no match for the winner but rallied with interest to get the place. CRITICAL CONDITION tracked the leading pair down the backstretch
and while saving ground on the turn, was asked for an inside bid into the lane, proved no match for BIG BLUE NOTE from upper stretch, chased on inside
but was caught for place in the final strides. SNOOZY SUZY broke last, was sent to press the pace outside of BIG BLUE NOTE from past the half mile
mark, attended outside the leader in the three path on the turn, proved no match from the three sixteenths, chased on mildly but lost the show late. ELLE
VICTOIRE was asked for position inside in the opening strides but settled at the rear, trailed in the two path on the turn, floated into the lane in the three to
four path under a drive, and passed tiring horses late. CHARMINGKINDAGAL settled toward the rear inside early, was driven near the rear in the two path
on the turn and into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. BELLA'S GIFT chased midfield early and in the three path on the turn, swung into the lane in the
four to five path and proved empty.

Footnotes
LEMON DROP LADY chased the leading pair, edged closer approaching the far turn, bid on the leaders three wide into the bend, vied outside of PLUMA
from the three eighths, continued to battle outside that foe into the lane, and edged to a defined lead in the final fifty yards. PLUMA tracked the pacesetter,
engaged inside of her into the far turn and took the lead near the seven sixteenths, vied inside of LEMON DROP LADY from the three eighths, continued to
battle down the stretch but was narrowly outfinished in the last fifty yards. SLEW SOUTH settled toward the rear, began to improve inside of ADDYDIDIT
near the half mile mark, took closer order inside around the far turn while pushed along, proved no match for the leading pair from near the quarter, chased
on willingly, gained on the leading pair late but could not reel them in. JEWEL OF DENIAL was off a bit slow, settled toward the rear, edged closer in tandem
with SEVEN POINTS to her outside into the far turn, rallied in earnest from near the three eighths, tipped out four wide, bid into the lane, chased on to gain
on the top two while racing just outside of SLEW SOUTH but was outkicked by that foe for the show. SEVEN POINTS came away a bit slowly, settled at the
rear, took closer order in tandem outside of JEWEL OF DENIAL into the far turn, was driven up the inside into the lane and offered a brief bid, but flattened
out in the final three sixteenths. ADDYDIDIT chased well behind the leading trio in a strung-out field, was urged three wide on the far turn and four wide into
the lane, and lacked the needed rally. LOW DOSE was keen to the early lead, set the pace while clear around the far turn and the back straight, was
headed by PLUMA to her inside near the seven sixteenths, retreated steadily, came into the lane three wide and had no further response when driven in
upper stretch. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

SURPRSINGLYPERFECT raced three wide toward the rear around the clubhouse turn, inched forward to chase three deep down the back straight,
improved further while still three deep past the half mile mark, floated six wide into the lane, stayed on under a drive, engaged outside of MISSED THE
BOAT and CZECHMIGHT past the furlong mark, led near the sixteenth and held off TOP OF THE GAME. The latter settled at the rear, trailed down the
back straight, was pushed along to gain around the far turn, swung eight wide into the lane, found his best stride in the final sixteenth, and missed. MISSED
THE BOAT attended the pace inside of MORE HONOR and CZECHMIGHT, tracked CZECHMIGHT around the far turn while racing inside, floated three
wide into the lane, drew even between CZECHMIGHT and the rallying SURPRSINGLYPERFECT past the furlong mark, lacked the kick of the latter and
flattened late. MAGIC MOSCO hopped at the start and was away awkwardly, settled in second last, was pushed along to gain from past the three eighths,
swung seven wide into the lane, continued to improve willingly and got up for a share of the show. CZECHMIGHT raced three wide with the leading flight
through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, took the lead alone into the far turn, continued clear under a drive in upper stretch, was headed near
the furlong pole and weakened in the final sixteenth. CAPTAIN RED raced between horses toward the rear through the clubhouse turn, continued to chase
down the back straight and around the turn, was driven five wide into the lane, and passed tiring horses late. PASSED BY PAUL tracked the leading trio,
was pushed along to make a bid three wide on the leading pair approaching the three eighths, came six wide into the lane, drifted out to the six path in
upper stretch while proving no match for CZECHMIGHT, chased on between horses to midstretch, but flattened out in the final furlong. SAYIN GRACE
chased inside, was driven for a bid inside into the lane, kept on in range to the furlong mark, and weakened. MORE HONOR raced between horses in the
leading flight, proved no match for the leaders from the half, gradually flattened around the far turn, came three wide into the lane, and continued to weaken.
EL CHUMELITO was keen inside near the rear early, was pushed along into the far turn, began to lose ground, and had no response when driven into the
lane.

Footnotes
DYNAMIC MIMI was slow into stride and settled near the rear, was pushed along for a four wide bid around the far turn, swung four wide into the lane,
sustained her rally, drove past ROSES FOR SUZZETT near the sixteenth and edged away. ROSES FOR SUZZETT broke sharply, tracked the leader well
off the inside down the back straight, continued in range around the turn, bid past the five sixteenths, engaged the leader near the quarter, headed her while
racing three wide into the lane, cleared, through midstretch, but was reeled in at the sixteenth by DYNAMIC MIMI and proved second best. ONEFINEDAY
soon led inside, set the pace while clear, was engaged by ROSES FOR SUZETT approaching the quarter pole, was headed by that foe into upper stretch,
proved no match for her or DYNAMIC MIMI, chased on earnestly and found just enough to hold a share of third place. I AM YOURS chased inside of FIRST
PROMISE down the back straight, raced at the inside of the chasing flight around the turn, swung three wide into the lane while driven between horses,
chased on, never threatened the leading pair but finished well enough to get up for a piece of the show. WORKIN NINETOFIVE settled toward the rear,
raced between horses in the chasing flight around the far turn, was outkicked by rallying foes past the five sixteenths, but passed outside tiring horses in the
lane. FIRST PROMISE tracked the leading pair inside, was urged for a bid inside in upper stretch, proved no match for ROSES FOR SUZZETT approaching
the furlong pole, and weakened. RUNNINGONTHETAFUEL settled at the rear, trailed inside through the far turn, came inside into the lane and offered no
rally.

INCLUDED past the half, tracked in range around the far turn, tipped two wide into upper stretch, bid outside of the leader and poked his head in front,
cleared past the furlong mark and held sway. BOB'S ALL IN settled near the rear inside, began to edge forward between horses near the half mile mark,
rallied well three to four wide around the far turn, swung six wide into the lane and sustained his rally, and kept on to secure the place late. EXETER broke
sharply and soon led, vied inside of FINAL ROSE from the three quarters to the half, took a narrow lead into the far turn, carried that lead into the lane, was
engaged in upper stretch by THIRTY SECONDS OUT to his outside, proved no match in the final furlong, and lost place late. OUR DANDY'S BOY raced
between horses in the tracking flight around the clubhouse turn, was a bit keen between horses into the back straight, chased outside of THIRTY
SECONDS OUT to the half, continued midfield as that foe advanced, kept on between horses around that second turn, was driven between horses into the
lane, proved no match for the leaders from upper stretch but kept on best of the rest. EL BORRACHO settled at the rear, continued to trail two to three wide
around the far turn, swung out near the center of the racetrack for the stretch run, and passed tiring horses outside. MAD AT MONEY settled near the rear
outside of BOB'S ALL IN, raced three wide while still near the rear approaching the half, raced near the rear two to three wide around the far turn, swung out
toward the center of the track into the lane, and passed tiring horses late. THETRAILERGUY chased outside of MONUMENTAL SEVEN through the
clubhouse turn, continued toward the rear down the backstretch, chased inside around the far turn and into the lane, and lacked the needed rally.
