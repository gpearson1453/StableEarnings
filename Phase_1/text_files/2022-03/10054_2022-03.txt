Footnotes
LETS RUN TWO chased after DANCE FOR GOLD early, bid between that one and CENTSATIONAL GRACE through the stretch, edged away and had
enough to stave off BLAME THE VETS in the final strides. BLAME THE VETS trailed for three furlongs, swung widest for the drive and closed strongly to
just miss. CENTSATIONAL GRACE pursued the early pace outside, bid in the four-path turning for home but weakened late. MAGNOLIA ROAD was outrun
early, and offered a mild response to pick up the last major share. ROUGH ENOUGH lacked the needed bid three wide. DANCE FOR GOLD sprinted clear
early, had the two-path into the lane, and yielded to outside challengers with a furlong remaining. BRAIN TRUST was no factor two wide. STORMY STELLA
was finished early inside.

Footnotes
MISH quickly cleared on top and set the pace racing four paths off the inside, held clear around the turn, came two wide into the upper stretch, shook the
reins past the furlong marker, responded willingly, drew off and finished in hand. EMBRACE MY UNCLE stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, hustled
along two to three wide around the turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and finished second best. CHUCKY tracked the pace through early stages,
launched a three to four wide bid mid-way around the turn and stayed on to secure a share. MAN ON THE MOON was forwardly placed along the inside up
the backstretch, hustled along just off the inside into the lane and gave way in the final furlong. NIXON JOY (ARG) raced in the back four wide, was ridden
along five wide into the upper stretch and failed to move into contention. KHOZY MY BOY was not too far back in the early going, failed to progress around
the turn and offered no late rally.

Footnotes
AWESOME FAMILY sped to the lead and angled inside soon after the start, took on the challenge from ADMIRAL TRUFFLES midway around the turn,
dueled into lane, dug in gamely under firm encouragement and edged away in deep stretch. HIGH PRESS rated just off the early pace, picked up the pace
two wide around the turn, shifted out wider for the drive, produced a solid finish and captured place. ADMIRAL TRUFFLES chased between foes in early
stages then moved up to challenge AWESOME FAMILY midway around the turn, dueled into late stages then failed to be a late match for the winner. THE
RED MAN chased three deep in early stages, continued in range into the lane then ran on evenly in the final furlong. UNIMPEACHED tracked just off the
second flight entering the turn, was ridden along into the upper stretch, shifted in to race two paths wide in late stages and needed more for late impact.
VALHALLA AIR BASE was hustled along out of the gate, remained in steady pursuit inside into the lane and lacked late kick.

BIG TENTATIONS settled in the second flight early toward the inside, advanced after six furlongs swinging out four wide, rallied to overhaul MIA CAMILA
from outside in deep stretch and edged clear. MIA CAMILA bumped with TAG HER at the start, rallied to contention four wide on the far turn, forged to a
clear lead in the stretch, then could not fend off the top one while best of the others. LUNA ANTONIA was slow early three wide, moved further out in the
track approaching the stretch, and rallied only mildly. DOWNBURST was covered up behind the early leaders, went along in the two-path to the stretch, and
faded. LONDON LADY saved ground to the far turn, moved to the far outside for the drive and failed to menace. TICKET TO HEAVEN was four wide early,
loomed a threat three wide after six furlongs, but could not sustain the rally. TAG HER bumped with MIA CAMILA at the start, set the pace inside for six
furlongs, and gave way. LIGEIA showed early speed, then retired.

Footnotes
EQUAL PAY sped to the lead soon after the start and tipped out a few paths wider, set the pace up the backstretch under a light rating, widened advantage
still unleashed around the turn and continued to pull away through the lane in hand. FIRST TO ACT was forwardly placed along the outside in early stages,
launched a three wide bid for EQUAL PAY around the turn, sustained a five wide run through the lane and finished clearly second best. SIEMPRE
ELEGANTE raced in contention near the inside, was ridden along the rail around the turn and prevailed for a share. EGYPTIAN BRIDE tracked the early
pace then retreated around the turn and continued to tire in the lane.

UNCORK THE BOTTLE raced up close two wide in early stages then inherited the lead entering the turn, came under a ride two to three wide into the upper
stretch, responded and finished clear. DOO WOP DON was ridden along the inside around the turn, tipped wider for the drive, sustained a steady bid for the
winner and secured second best. GAME BOY BENNY was forwardly placed just off the inside then steadied sharply and bobbled when the leader got pulled
up entering the turn, lost all momentum and dropped back, launched a game rebid along the outside into the lane and bested the rest. OHIO EAGLE was
well reserved racing well in the back, tucked inside around the turn, was under steady urging into the lane and failed to rally. AEQUOR slammed the side of
the gate hard at the start causing rider to momentarily lose iron, roused forward into close contention around the turn then came up empty in the lane. FACE
OF VICTORY briefly held the lead then got pulled up entering the turn and vanned off after the race. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY WHICH

PHANTOM VISION pressed the early pace between horses, wrested command outside DIRTY DANGLE leaving the furlong grounds and edged clear.
HONEY PANTS saved ground early in midpack, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and rallied with good energy outside the winner. FOUZIA
raced close up behind the leaders to the stretch two wide, and finished evenly. MILLENNIUM FORCE settled in the second flight early three wide, shifted
out a bit wider for the drive and gained mildly. JEANIE B (GB) was no threat two wide. WHIMSICAL MUSE broke slowest and never factored. DIRTY
DANGLE set a pressured pace inside to midstretch, and weakened. VIOLENZA was outrun inside. LEXINATOR pursued outside the leaders three wide
early, and weakened turning for home. TIMES REMOVED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
RAPTUROUS tracked the pace near the inside in early stages, was ridden along two wide around the turn, took the inside position at the head of the lane,
roused forward to the lead just past the furlong marker and widened advantage under steady urging. STELLAR RIDE shifted off the inside soon after the
start and tracked the embattled pair into the turn, launched a three wide bid near the five-sixteenths pole, sustained a steady run through the lane and
secured place. AMANI'S IMAGE was unhurried racing in the back and angled inside midway through the backstretch, angled out at the quarter pole, hustled
along four wide into the lane and captured show. CANCEL THIS raced just off the second flight going by the half mile marker, chased three wide around the
turn, tipped wider for the drive and needed more for late impact. DOLL BABY dueled outside of FROSTY BREW for the early lead then shook free past the
three eighths pole, held clear through the turn, got collared by the winner leaving the furlong marker and steadily weakened. FROSTY BREW dueled inside
of DOLL BABY up the backstretch, could not match strides past the three eighths pole and steadily faded. JET FORCE had no response and steadily
retreated.

Footnotes
BUILT DIFFERENT tracked inside up the backstretch, was patiently handled around the far turn, raced behind rivals at the head of the lane, found a path
three wide with a furlong left to run, roused forward between foes and drew clear. PRETTYKEEN lost path and clipped heels shortly after the start, lagged
behind into the first turn, remained unhurried two wide up the backstretch, picked up the pace late on the far turn, lugged in and roused left handed in the
upper stretch, dug in four deep a furlong out and captured place, raced without front shoes. WARWOMAN tracked in the second flight up the backstretch,
was ridden along three wide around the final turn, vied for the lead with a furlong left to run then failed to kick on with the winner and got edged late for
place. HARD ROCK WARRIOR held a slim lead around the first turn and set a pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled around the far turn and into the
upper stretch then came up empty in the final furlong. FRAGEELAY applied pace pressure to HARD ROCK WARRIOR in the first turn and forced the issue
through the backstretch, dueled for command around the far turn then tired in the drive. MILES OF SMILES bobbled and got bumped at the start, rated off
the early pace, showed interest three wide around the far turn then failed to sustain bid in the lane. WINNING LAUGH bumped the gate at the start, rated off
the early pace and raced between foes late on the backstretch, was hustled along two wide around the final turn and failed to kick on. KATNISS got bumped
back, lost path and steadied shortly after the start, was not too far back saving ground in early stages then had no response when called upon and steadily
weakened.
