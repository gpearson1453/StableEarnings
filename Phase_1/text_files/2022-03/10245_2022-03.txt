Footnotes
GREY ROGUE moved to the front and made the pace from along the inside, dug in through the far turn when challenged by BROADWAY then dueled that
one to the wire to finish on even terms. BROADWAY saved ground to late second turn, angled out and moved to the leaders three wide to challenge,
continued outside GREY ROGUE to duel that with his rider losing whip turning for home then went head-to-head in the lane to finish on even terms. WATER
PATROL was in each while trailing three and four wide, moved up going to the far turn but could not get to the top pair. DAYS OF GLORY prompted the
pace outside GREY ROGUE to midway up the backstretch and tired. FAKE SOLUTION followed the pace three wide and tired through the far turn.

STREET N SOUR was on the lead racing well off the inside, shook free into the far turn remaining out about the three or four path, was roused briefly
entering the lane then was taken in hand through the final sixteenth. SUBSCRIPTION followed the pace three wide then rallied clear for the place while no
threat to the winner. HANDY BOY tracked the winner's pace from outside to midway up the backstretch, continued nearest that one into the lane but could
not hold position. THE BONDSMAN lacked a rally two to three wide. LEFT BEHIND saved ground nearest the early pace and weakened. WHERE'S
FREDO hesitated at the break to get away last and was always back. PERVASIVE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DARE FELIX was on the pace out from the rail while inside a rival, shook free through the far turn then was roused into the lane and held a safe margin the
remainder. FERRARI ROAD followed the pace four wide, angled in through the far turn to get nearest the winner turning for home but could not threaten
that one late. DREAM BABY DREAM dropped off the early pace three wide, moved up while five wide into the lane and gained the show. RENVYLE trailed
to the far turn, fanned six wide into the lane and moved up. GAMERA chased the early pace three wide and weakened. ALL SHACKED UP forced the early
pace outside the winner and weakened. SEELEY saved ground, angled out nearing the lane and failed to threaten. PAPA CABALLERO tired racing two to
three wide.

Footnotes
BUD MINISTER saved ground to late backstretch, angled four wide to rally through the far turn then continued with good energy to move off under steady
handling. HEAROSEONEASTER dropped back off the pace saving ground, moved out in the far turn to rally five wide into the lane and rallied to gain the
place late. UNCLE TAP was back off the pace outside, rallied four and five wide through the far turn into the lane gained the show. FEISTY BIRD rallied four
and five wide on the far turn to gain position late. DOUBLETROUBLE BEAR settled three wide, moved inside for the drive and was briefly in tight midstretch
then came up short in the photo for minor placings. FORGERY chased the early pace along the inside and lacked a final closing run. MY BOY GUS showed
the most early speed to cross over and gain inside position, made the pace to the lane and weakened. CRIMSON TRACE followed the early pace three
wide and weakened. SHADY'S TURN chased the leaders two or three wide and tired.

Footnotes
SILVER MAKER lunged at the break to come away last, saved ground to begin his rally going up the backstretch, angled out nearing the lane to bid outside
YANK CRIME and moved clear under steady handling. YANK CRIME was on the pace inside rivals to the far turn, edged clear through that bend then could
not handle the winner's late run. LITTLE JOHN was back off the pace outside, moved up four and five wide into the lane and bested the others. KID'S
MISCHIEF contested the pace between rivals to the far turn and weakened. JAZZY JUSTIN saved ground and lacked a rally. BURGAMEISTER saved
ground, angled into the lane but was no threat. JOMO failed to make a bid three to four wide. MASTERPIECE DAY was on the pace outside rivals to the far
turn and tired.

Footnotes
WRATH was on the pace inside THE BIG SHOW to the far turn, repelled bids turning for home and rallied back clear. THE BIG SHOW prompted the pace
outside the winner to bid into the lane but could not handle that one late. CAESARTHERULER stalked the pace in good position along the inside but could
not produce the needed late run. ACCOUSTICAL saved ground to late far turn, angled out through the lane and moved up late. COWORKER moved up five
wide to bid into the lane but could not sustain the move. SPEEDY FELLAR stalked the pace three or four wide in reach but lacked the needed late rally.
SOUTHGATE was not a threat four wide. TIGER THE MAN was always back and fanned five wide into the lane. Fractional times not available.

ITS A WRAP was unhurried early saving ground, rallied inside through the far turn and found room inside rivals turning for home, responded with a good
late run and was going clear at the end. HAYDENS HAVOC contested the lead out from the rail inside GETALOADOFTHIS, was joined by
OURBESTFRIEND DL to be between rivals through the far turn then dug in for the drive but could not hold the winner safe. OURBESTFRIEND D L stalked
the pace inside, bid while coming off the inside nearing the lane and continued on well but could not contain the top pair. GETALOADOFTHIS was on the
pace three or four wide outside HAYDENS HAVOC and weakened into the lane. BRAINSTORM moved up four wide but could not threaten late. ST. LOUIE
GUY was four and five wide throughout and failed to rally. STEPHEN'S ANSWER was close up to the early pace three wide and weakened. BORN AGAIN
