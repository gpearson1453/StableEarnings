Footnotes
SLAATS stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up four-wide to offer a bid into the stretch, vied with NOT THAT SERIOUS and drew off through
the final sixteenth. NOT THAT SERIOUS disputed the pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the three-sixteenths
marker, vied with that rival but could not match strides in the drive. THE MET dueled for the lead while racing four-wide and lacked the needed late
response. HEY NOW was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. BANGO FOR BUCKS showed no early
speed, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a factor.

SILLY NOTION sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane with
complete authority. CONVINCE lacked early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to
gain the place. GOLD INCLUDED settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. SHOE GAME
lagged early, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with a belated bid. IT'S ALEXUS was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through
the second turn and gave way. TIZ WONDERFULLY chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going three-quarters.

CHICKS DIG MUNNY raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the turn, responded to steady urging and wore down KEEPINMYPROMISE in the
closing yards. KEEPINMYPROMISE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a quarter to run,
opened a clear lead but could not resist the winner late. TIZ TENACIOUS was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing four-wide and gave way
through the final furlong. MOUNTAIN PASS disputed the pace from off the rail and gave way with a furlong. TWILIGHT GALAXY lacked early speed, raced
five-wide through the turn and failed to rally.

Footnotes
THORN HILL CAT stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and quickly drew off. THIRTY SECONDS
OUT broke sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide, offered a bid nearing the three-eighths marker, led into mid-stretch and yielded to the winner.
PLAYOFF BOUND lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn, remained inside for the drive, steadied in mid-stretch and finished willingly
when clear. PROVOST was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. START A RUNNIN was away alertly to
set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way after going three-quarters. ROCKY TOUGH showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second
turn and was not a factor. EL CHUMELITO settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened. RIDEO chased the
leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going six furlongs.

Footnotes
CIBERTRUCK settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and wore down I WILL YEAH
(IRE) in the closing yards. I WILL YEAH (IRE) was reserved just off the leaders from the inside early, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the fore
nearing the three-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead but could not match strides with the winner late. FISHEL was void of early speed, saved ground
through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished evenly. WILLTOBELUCKY showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn
and finished with some late run. BODEGA raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the second turn and failed to menace. CRYPTO GOLD
was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. ROUSING RUBBLE was away in good order to duel for the lead from
the inside and weakened after going five furlongs. SINGLE BARREL broke awkwardly, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going
a half. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND broke sharply to dispute the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going five-eighths. THE RACE WAS HAND
TIMED.
