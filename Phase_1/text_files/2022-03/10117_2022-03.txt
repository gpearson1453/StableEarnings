about early, was in tight inside in the opening quarter, faded on the turn then came again in the stretch. DADASHEV dropped back after the start, rallied
wide and closed well while no threat. ONE NINER TANGO earned a narrow advantage inside, vied through the turn and faded. KISSES FOR VAL dueled
between rivals on the turn and proved empty in the stretch. PORSUPUESTO trailed early, moved briefly closer on the turn then faltered.

rallied late outside and got up for second at the wire. SEIZE THE WHISKEY stalked close up early on the outside, commenced her bid on the turn, loomed
in upper stretch, dug in gamely, then weakened late and lost second at the wire. MISS ALEX chased on the inside and failed to rally. SHARON'S LAW
chased three wide, continued three wide on the turn and weakened in the lane. LEFTATTHEALTAR raced off the pace with an inside trip and failed to
threaten. REMEMBER THIS GAL raced off the pace and did not factor. LUZ raced off the rail, off the pace and was outrun.

Footnotes
SILVER FURY angled inside on the turn, rallied in the stretch and and edged clear through the final furlong. DECKOLOGY chased wide throughout, loomed
a stretch threat but was outfinished. DEFIBRILLATOR lacked speed, moved very wide and closed well late. BURN AND TURN rushed to contention inside,
angled out on the turn and flattened. DIESEL quickly drew clear, led to midstretch and faltered. IMPACTFUL trailed early then passed rivals without
menacing. GOLDENLINEOF chased outside and lacked a rally. SPEED SYNDROME lagged far behind and was never a factor. SHANDIAN flashed speed
outside then stopped abruptly. THE REIGN MAN saved ground well behind and weakened steadily.
