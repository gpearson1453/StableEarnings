Footnotes
JOYFUL NOISE stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch and around the turn, eased out to the four path turning for home, gained command
outside foes near the sixteenth pole and drew clear under urging. MAKE IT A DOUBLE stalked the pace two wide on the turn, swung to the three path
entering the stretch, gained a short lead in mid stretch and continued willingly. R TRUE SENSATION disputed the pace outside DANNY DEEP CUTS and
weakened the final furlong. SILENT FLUIDITY bumped FAMILY FORTUNE when bearing out at the break, saved ground around the turn and was not a
factor. FAMILY FORTUNE bumped DANNY DEEP CUTS when bumped and forced out leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path on the turn and was
not a factor. WIN THEN GRIN , three deep on the turn, was outrun. DANNY DEEP CUTS bumped with FAMILY FORTUNE after bobbling at the break,
hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to upper stretch and faltered.

IMAGINE THE MOJO , four wide past the seven eighths, edged up outside a rival leaving the three quarter pole and stalked, was put to a strong ride leaving
the far turn, pursued into the lane, kept on doggedly under left handed asking, drew alongside CHICA RABIOSA inside the sixteenth pole, dueled head to
head and got the bob. CHICA RABIOSA was sent from the gate and prompted the issue outside a rival past the seven eighths, put a head in front into the
backstretch then shook clear past the three quarter pole, dropped in and set a rated pace, came under pressure in upper stretch, dug in when confronted in
deep stretch, kept on valiantly but just missed. TINAS SHINING STAR chased the pace, saved some ground into the far turn, shifted four wide and got past
a tired rival for the show. LOLA FLO , between rivals early, stalked three wide past the five eighths, failed to kick on under pressure nearing the quarter pole
and gave way. MIZ THE BEST held the early lead towards the rail, ceded command into the backstretch, dropped further back into the far turn then faltered
approaching the stretch.

VICTORY GIVEN drifted in on JUNGLE WARRIOR soon after the break, stalked the duel while three wide around the turn, advanced outside the duelers to
take the lead in mid stretch then drive clear while drifting out. AMEN CORNER lacked speed, raced in the three path leaving the turn and rallied between
horses. BIG HAMBONE sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail disputing the pace and finished gamely. JUNGLE WARRIOR , bumped and pinched
back soon after the break, circled the turn four wide and rallied outside foes. PET'S NIGHT raced in the two path on the turn, angled to the three path in
upper stretch, worked between horses and passed tired ones. LITTLE BOLD BANDIT disputed the pace outside BIG HAMBONE and gave way in mid
stretch. FINAL SAY was outrun. EXTRA MEDIUM saved ground on the turn, remained along the inner rail in the stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
JUST PICK ONE , under a ride leaving the far turn, moved up between rivals mid turn, shifted out four wide into the lane, leveled off under left handed
asking in mid stretch, sustained under pressure and forged past DIVINE PROPORTION in the final yards. DIVINE PROPORTION rated to the inside of a
rival early on, eased out around the turn and was called upon, quickly moved up and engaged the leader nearing the quarter pole, assumed command soon
after, kicked clear under a drive past the three sixteenths, kept on gamely but just failed to contain the winner's charge. DEJOHN dueled outside
BALTIMORE BUD through the opening quarter mile, disposed of that one and cleared near the three eighths, dropped in then was collared after a half mile,
stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. TRIPLE AMERICANO , sluggish from the gate, was under pressure three wide into the lane, dropped in and came
up empty. INJECT THE LIGHT chased outside a rival, moved up some four wide past the five sixteenths, pursued to mid stretch then faded. BALTIMORE
BUD broke a step slow, rushed up soon after and disputed the pace to the inside of DEJOHN, failed to keep up past the three eighths and faltered.

I'M GITTIN THERE tracked inside, was under pressure to maintain a forward spot mid turn, eased out past the three sixteenths for room, knifed her way
between rivals past mid stretch, responded to right handed asking and eagerly kicked clear. SHE'S A BIG DEAL cleared early, set the pace off the rail into
the lane, clung to the advantage under a drive past the eighth pole, gave way grudgingly in the final fifty yards and managed to save the place. SEA PINES
broke a step slow, pulled her way forward between runners near the half mile marker, had aim three wide into the lane, was floated out a bit by the winner
near mid stretch and kept on with effort. JOE MIKE JIM , sluggish at the break, moved up three wide into the turn, was in range past the five sixteenths,
swung six wide and churned on with interest. MY BOSS prompted the pace, came four wide for the drive, gave willing chase past mid stretch but flattened
out very late. MISS CASEY broke slow, regrouped and moved up four wide outside rivals heading past the five eighths, was under pressure pursuing past
the five sixteenths and weakened.

LOW COUNTRY DUDE saved ground around the turn, closed inside STACKS OF SILVER and was up at the finish. STACKS OF SILVER , right to the early
lead, set the pace two wide around the turn, drifted to the four path turning for home, drifted out in mid stretch and just missed. BURGEE lacked speed,
circled rivals on the turn, was six deep turning for home, raced on his left lead and rallied. CODIGO , inside horses around the turn, hugged the inner rail in
the stretch and flattened out. SCINTILLIO , three wide on the turn, drifted four wide turning for home and failed to rally. BLAMEITONTHEFUN raced in the
two path between horses on the turn and gave way in the drive. VIOLENT ROCK prompted the pace outside STACKS OF SILVER, was fanned five deep
turning for home and gave way.

Footnotes
OUTKISSED took it to AL LOVES JOSIE from the get go, prompted that one from the outside while in hand, seized command near the quarter pole, quickly
widened past the three sixteenths, was kept alert with left handed asks past the eighth pole then maintained a comfortable lead while steadily hand ridden
late. STEINBECK stumbled at the break and was brushed, regrouped and stalked early from the inside, dropped back a bit mid turn, eased out soon into the
lane, leveled off nearing mid stretch and finished with good energy. AL LOVES JOSIE came in a bit at the break and brushed with STEINBECK, accelerated
to a short early advantage, was hounded by the winner, ceded the lead nearing the lane then weakened in the final furlong. SUNDAY MISCHIEF bobbled
slightly at the break, chased to the outside of a rival and gave way.

Footnotes
TITAN'S WILL showed speed three deep around the first turn, remained three wide entering the far turn, opened up in upper stretch then was kept to his
business. BAHAMA CHANNEL , three wide the first turn, was four deep entering the far turn and rallied nicely. LOST MY VOWCHER , forwardly placed
early, bid for the lead in the two path between horses entering the far turn, remained prominent to the stretch and weakened. PERCHER , bumped and
pinched back leaving the starting gate, raced between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. UNION LEADER lacked speed, circled the far turn four
wide, floated to the six path in upper stretch and was not a factor. HAYNE'S FEVER stalked the pace, raced three wide the far turn and weakened.
LUDICROUS MODE bore out leaving the starting gate, was outrun and swung to the six path in upper stretch. EDICT showed speed along the inner rail and
faltered on the far turn.
