Footnotes
SWEET BAY stalked the clear leader from the three path, took aim on that foe turning for home while inching closer, drove past her in upper, drew clear,
then held sway from a pursuing SPY A STAR while under wraps in the late stages. SPY A STAR trailed along the inside, gained inside of foes entering the
lane, tipped outside of the clearing leader approaching the furlong grounds, took aim, and was gaining on that geared down leader late. TIDDLY sped clear
early on, but was caught by the eventual winner in upper stretch, and tired. CUSTOM FOR CARLITA laid off of the pace two wide, fanned to the five path
turning for home before trailing entering the lane, then moved up for a minor share. I LOVE TO RACE lacked early speed along the inside into the turn,
tipped to the four path and between horses at the five sixteenths pole, was bumped by an inner rival at the quarter pole, and failed to factor. RIVETRIX
chased the clear leader from the two path while inside of the eventual winner, failed to match rallying strides with that foe approaching the five sixteenths
pole, shifted to the three path at that marker while a pair of outer foes gained alongside, then bumped her most immediate rival at the quarter pole while
weakening.

Footnotes
DOCTRINAIRE stalked along the inside early on, shifted outside of the leading pair entering the turn, ranged up to bid for the lead entering the lane, led in
upper stretch, and inched clear in the final furlong. BACK ALLEY JAMMIN settled far back two wide, shifted outside of the leading trio in upper stretch, then
stayed on while hanging on his left lead to claim place in the late stages. TRIPPER JOHN set the pace outside of a rival, briefly cleared at the five sixteenths
pole before meeting DOCTRINAIRE's bid entering the lane, but was headed by that foe in upper stretch, gave way while hanging on his left lead leaving the
furlong grounds, and lost place in the final sixteenth. BIG BOSS MAN laid close up inside of the pace setter into the turn, but failed to keep pace at the five
sixteenths pole, then faded in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead. K T'S JILTED GROOM raced off of the pace three wide, got outmoved by an
inner foe entering the lane while being floated four wide, and failed to factor. P T'S FLASH saved ground far off of the pace, but never got involved. BLUE
RIDGE RED tracked the top trio early on, chased them from the four path around the turn, then was floated five wide entering the lane as inner foes moved
along side, and faded while not asked for run through the lane. GINA'S BROTHER showed little.

Footnotes
IBERVILLE set the pace in the three path before clearing to the rail around the first turn, felt pressure from an outer UNINVITED GUEST before vying with
that bidding foe around the far turn, repelled that rival while CAUSE TO CRUISE menaced in upper stretch, got briefly headed at the furlong grounds, but
fought on resiliently to regain an advantage passing that marker, dueled to the wire, and prevailed gamely. CAUSE TO CRUISE broke inwardly at the start
but was quickly corrected, stalked three wide, bid for the lead in upper stretch as an inner IBERVILLE resisted, poked a head in front approaching the
furlong grounds, but was re-headed by aforementioned foe leaving that station, then dueled through the late stages, but failed to regain even terms.
UNINVITED GUEST pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart as well as an outer bidder in upper
stretch, got headed by an inner foe for show at the furlong grounds, but fought on late and reclaimed that position via a tight photo. DOWN COLD stalked
along the inside, chased the top trio around the far turn, bid for show inside of UNINVITED GUEST at the furlong grounds, reached that position shortly
after, but hung and was nailed late by his outer counterpart. STOCKPILER broke a step slowly and shied a bit from an outer foe at the start, laid off of the
pace along the inside, was asked for run in the two path into the far turn, took that bend in the three path, then failed to progress in the five path through the
lane. MONARCH MAN tracked in the two path, chased under urging from off of the pace in the four path around the far turn, fanned to the six path entering
the lane, and failed to factor. FIGHTVILLE rushed the gates while waiting for them to open, was allowed to settle shortly after, then hopped inwardly and
bumped the gate when they were finally sprung, spotted the leaders multiple lengths in the process, then trailed throughout and showed little.

CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST tracked in the two path, gained three wide around the far turn to bid in upper stretch, awkwardly changed leads while gaining an
advantage, then drove clear. KANNON WITH A K vied two wide and between horses early on, stalked down the backstretch, re-bid for the lead inside of the
pace setter in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outside bidder in the process, then held place on his left lead. UNBRIDLED HOPE bumped an inner
foe at the start, laid close up along the inside, led at the half mile pole, showed the way around the far turn, but was bested by rivals on either side in upper
stretch. BODEE BODEE raced at the rear in the four path around the first turn, then saved ground off of the pace around the far turn, and stayed on but
failed to threaten. PA PI broke a bit inwardly, laid off of the pace along the inside, but was wrangled back between horses entering the backstretch to trail
the field, then passed tired foes through the lane. PAC THE PULPIT never got involved. JOHNNY BOOTLEGGS bumped with an outer rival at the start,
stalked in the three path, moved forward approaching the far turn, pressed two wide around the bend, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. AW HECK
failed to factor. RUN TO BLADE vied three wide, led entering the backstretch, but weakened at the half mile pole, wilted through the field in the early part of
the far turn, and stopped.

BIG CHOPPER established a loose lead early on, widened his advantage at the half mile pole to steal the show, and inched further away through the lane.
EVERLOVINGHAND stalked two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader into the far turn, dueled for place with his inner entry-mate through the final
furlong after that foe claimed that position, but regained it late. BATTLE OF WILL tracked from the two path, bid inside of his entry-mate for place in
midstretch, but succumbed to that foe in that battle. YOUR TIME'S COMING settled off of the pace along the inside, moved two wide and between horses
down the backstretch, but tentatively backed out of that spot into the far turn, then kept on. PERRINS laid far back in the two to three paths around the turns,
and failed to menace. SY MICHAEL trailed in the three path early on, moved out of last in the two path around the far turn, but never got involved. COFFEE
COUNTY tracked three wide, but failed to keep pace around the far turn, and weakened through the final furlong. TOE BANDIT laid off of the pace three
wide, and faded.

Footnotes
DEANO tracked in the two to three path turning for home, bid three wide in upper stretch, drifted a bit outwardly before shifting back in while vying in
midstretch, then led entering the final sixteenth, and lasted from an outer surging foe to the wire. GOTTA GO saved ground off of the pace, chased the
leading trio through upper stretch, tipped outside of them entering the final sixteenth, then surged late, but missed. CURTIN'S UP set the pace, led inside of
a vying ROCKDALE around the turn, got headed approaching the lane, gamely reclaimed an advantage inside of a pair of rivals in upper stretch, but was
bested by an outer bidder entering the final sixteenth, and lost place late. ROCKDALE stalked three to two wide into the turn, bid at the three furlong pole,
vied before forging a narrow advantage approaching the lane, but was re-headed by his inner counterpart in upper stretch as an outer foe bid, then gave
way to those rivals passing the furlong grounds. TIGERBEACH laid off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, and tired.

KEYS INCLUDED vied for the lead inside of LORD ZED, battled on through the lane via a long duel, and prevailed. LORD ZED vied for the lead outside of
KEYS INCLUDED, sparred with that rival through the lane via a long duel, brushed him in the final furlong, but yielded late. TRICOLOUR broke a beat
slowly, settled far back along the inside, gained in the four path around the far turn, then stayed on to claim show at the furlong grounds. BROTHER
HAROLD stalked along the inside, chased the top pair through upper stretch, but lost show at the furlong grounds, faded, but saved fourth. CRYPTIC CODE
broke a beat slowly, and failed to factor. KEEN HEIR took solid bumps from rivals on either side at the start, tracked two wide, then tired in the five path
around the far turn. CURLIN EDGES bumped an inner foe at the start, and never got involved. SHARP SENSATION was reset in the gate after being briefly
fractious, then squarely bumped an outer rival at the start, perched himself outside of the top pair while stalking three wide, but weakened between horses
approaching the five sixteenths pole.

JANISTHEBEAUTY set the pace inside of a prompting foe, shook clear of that rival entering the lane, and lasted to the wire. KISS GOODBYE laid off of the
pace along the inside, came into the lane in the three path, shifted inwardly at the three sixteenths to claim place from outer rivals approaching the furlong
grounds, then stayed on to take aim outside of the clear leader late, but did not have enough to reach him. VALE MALE returned to the paddock after the
post parade in order to replace a broken saddle, stalked the top pair from the three to four path, got outkicked by an inner rival while bidding for place
approaching the furlong grounds, then stayed on to secure show. BITSY C C LIL GIRL prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader
entering the lane, then tired between horses at the furlong grounds while hanging on her left lead. PRISSY JADEN raced far back in the three path around
the turn, and failed to factor. SUPER ET chased along the inside, but faded. LOCO POCO never got involved. STELLA LINK laid far back in the four path
around the turn, and tired.

HIGH SPEED broke a beat slowly, laid off of the pace along the inside, tracked from the three path entering the lane while searching for racing room, rallied
through to bid for the lead in the final sixteenth inside of a bidding MY FRIEND AMY, forged an advantage fifty yards from home, and held. MY FRIEND
AMY broke a step slowly, gained from far back while in the five path around the turn, tipped to the six path entering the lane, sustained her rally to bid in the
final sixteenth along with an inner HIGH SPEED, but was outkicked. FLY ME HOME was reluctant to load, did so rider-less, sped clear early on, showed the
way while tipping to the two path entering the lane, held sway through midstretch, but was worn down by a pair of foes in the final sixteenth. JALEBI BABY
stalked in the two path as the clear leader's closest pursuer while under mild urging, came into the lane in the three path, sustained his chase between
horses through midstretch, but was outkicked by rivals on either side approaching the final sixteenth. PLEASE BE KIND stalked in the three to four path
around the turn, chased through upper stretch, but yielded between horses leaving the furlong grounds. SIXTYTHREECALIBER laid off of the pace, failed to
sustain her positioning while in the three path around the turn, but picked up stride passing the quarter pole, tipped to the six path at the sixteenth pole, and
passed tiring foes with mild interest. MOST EMPRESSIVE tracked from midpack in the three path, shifted to the five path at the quarter pole, but lacked a
kick outside of the leaders, then was outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and tired. MEDWAY QUEEN was reluctant to load, the tracked along
the inside, but faded in upper stretch. RYAN'S GRACE raced far back in the four path around the turn, and never got involved. DIAMANT DAMHSA (IRE)
laid off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and faded. SUMMER TSUNAMI had her head turned to the left when the gates opened, broke a step
slowly before bobbling a bit at the start, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GREELEY WENT WEST tracked from midpack along the inside, split the leading pair entering the lane, dueled with an inner game early pace-setter through
the final furlong, and prevailed. FRIENDOFTHECOURT set the pace along the inside, repelled an outer rival's bid approaching the lane before meeting
GREELEY WENT WEST's challenge entering it, dueled gamely inside of that rival after being headed entering the final furlong, but was bested.
UNWANTED INTRUDER saved ground far off of the pace, in the improved inside of foes in upper stretch. QUEETEN broke a step slowly, laid off of the
pace in the four to three path, then moved up in upper stretch, but failed to threaten while hanging on his left lead. LUCKY STREAKER trailed, then passed
tired rivals in upper stretch. CAEUS IN PASADENA stalked along the inside while in the two path early on, shifted outside of the leading pair down the
backstretch, pursued in the four path around that turn before being floated to the five path entering the lane, and tired. THREE RUN HOMER prompted the
leader while intentionally staying a path away from that foe, pressed in earnest around the far turn, but drifted to the four path approaching the lane, allowed
an inner foe to bid in the process, and weakened. PERFECTURE broke a step slowly, recovered to stalk in the three path, got rank entering the backstretch,
then faded a furlong later and was done early.
