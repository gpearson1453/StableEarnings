Footnotes
CHARLIE'S TOWN set the pace inside of a pressing foe, drew clear entering the lane, then widened under driving pressure. OLE STUD MUFFIN prompted
the pace setter from the outside, but drifted outwardly while failing to keep pace entering the lane, and maintained place in the center of the track. BODEE
BODEE lost his footing at the start, ducked out, and spotted the field multiple lengths at the start, trailed around the turn, split foes two wide at the three
sixteenths pole, and rolled through traffic thereafter. PAC THE PULPIT took the turn far off of the pace in the two path, altered course four wide and outside
of foes approaching the final sixteenth, improved to reach a minor share. YANKEE HAIL CAT chased two wide around the turn, and tired on his left lead.
DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY rushed between horses after breaking a beat slowly, stalked the leading pair along the inside around the turn, but tired through the
lane. PA PI raced far back in the five path and made little impact. MULETRAIN laid off of the pace in the four path, and tired. VERDUNVILLE was very
fractious while resisting being loaded, then never got involved.

Footnotes
GALLANT STAR set a clear pace, met his stable-mate's challenge entering the lane, dueled with that foe thereafter, and held gamely. CUSTOM KAT
tracked four wide into the turn, moved up to take aim on the clear leader turning for home, bid at the quarter pole sparking a duel, but hung on his left lead,
and failed to go by. THUNK took the turn in the five path while off of the pace, gained show in upper stretch, and held it from a pair of inner foes while
hanging on his left lead. HOT LE ROY chased from midpack under steady urging in the two path, kept on to bid for show inside of rivals at the sixteenth
pole, but was denied. CHAMBLISS stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail entering the lane, chased from between horses through the final furlong,
but lacked a bid. KINLEE'S SONG took a brush from an outer foe at the start, then raced far back in the five path, and made little impact. VON DOM chased
two to three wide and between horses, and tired. STEAL IT BACK never got involved. PAT ME DOWN showed little.

TONAL IMPACT settled at the rear two wide, picked up stride in the four path around the far turn, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, and drove clear
entering the final sixteenth. FAHAN set the pace inside of a prompting foe, inched clear at the quarter pole, met TONAL IMPACT's bid in midstretch, and
was bested entering the final sixteenth. FLYING FRED stalked along the inside, got outmoved by an outer foe entering the lane, and chased the top pair
from the three path thereafter without gaining. UNORTHODOX trailed around both turns, altered four wide in midstretch, and moved up. DOVER STRAIT
stalked two wide, but weakened between horses approaching the five sixteenths pole. MR. J. MCKAY tracked in the four path around the first turn, failed to
keep pace before tucking to the rail into the far turn, then tired through the lane. WHISKEY GENT prompted the pace two wide, but weakened between
horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
JUS MY IMAGINATION acted up in the gate briefly before the start, dueled for the lead inside of THE COMPLETE COURT while a few paths off of the rail
around the turn, met GALAXY THIRTYSIX's inside challenge at the three sixteenths pole, dueled with that rival thereafter, and gamely held an advantage to
the wire. GALAXY THIRTYSIX also reared in the gate pre-race, stalked in the four path as the dueling leaders' closest pursuer, shifted inwardly entering the
lane to bid for the lead inside of JUS MY IMAGINATION at the three sixteenths pole, battled with that foe through the final furlong, but was denied getting
past, and lost the photo-finish. THE COMPLETE COURT pulled into the turn to duel for the lead outside of JUS MY IMAGINATION while in the four path,
but failed to keep pace with that foe entering the lane, then maintained show thererafter. OPPS MY BAD saved ground off of the pace, then failed to
threaten through the lane while besting an outer rival for a minor share. KICK N KISS raced at the rear in the two path, altered to the five path in midstretch,
and surpassed a rival without factoring. PLATINUM SKY tracked in midpack in the three path around the turn, and tired. COMMERCIAL FLASH took the
turn in the four path while at the rear of the field, and was outrun.

Footnotes
BOURBON ST TAPPIN bobbled a bit at the start and trailed the field, commenced a rally two wide and between horses into the far turn, sustained a rail
charge entering the lane, then blew past the outer leaders at the three sixteenths pole, and drew off. NOW NOW MAN laid close up along the inside around
the first turn, backed off to stalk passing the five furlong pole, took aim on the leader from the three path around the far turn, but was swiftly outkicked by an
inner bidding rival at the three sixteenths, then kept on to claim place at the furlong grounds. GREY SLOAN laid off of the pace in the three to five paths, and
stayed on. WISH UPON A STAR tracked in midpack two wide and between horses around the first turn, nudged an outer foe approaching the far turn, took
that bend in the four path, then wandered about while hanging on his left lead through the lane, and lacked a bid. CHARLI MICHAEL set the pace two wide,
cleared his inner counterpart approaching the nine-sixteenths pole, showed the way in the two path around the far turn, but proved no match for an inner
rival at the three sixteenths pole, and tired. JOEBOY tracked in midpack in the four path, took a brush from an inner foe approaching the far turn, tucked to
the two path shortly after, and failed to factor. BITSY'S OTHER HALF laid off of the pace along the inside, trailed around the far turn, and made little impact.
PEACHY MANDATE stalked three wide, but wilted between horses around the far turn.

DREAM MUSIC was tough to load, then set the pace into the turn, met a pair of pressing rivals' outer bids at the five sixteenths pole, but repelled them at
the quarter pole, shook clear, drew off, and was put to hand late. VINEGAR VEGGIES pressed two wide, bid for the lead between horses at the five
sixteenths pole, but was turned away entering the lane, and proved second best. RACEDAY ATTIRE stalked three wide, ranged up to bid at the five
sixteenths pole, but was repelled entering the lane, tired thereafter, and just lasted for show. ABBY THE BULL DAWG broke half a step slowly, raced far
back in the three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on late, but just missed reaching a tiring foe for show. GILLIAN ELIZABETH
chased the leading trio from the two path around the turn, then tired between horses in the final furlong. CAJUN TWO STEP trailed by a distance around the
turn, then never got involved. BEL ARIA saved ground far off of the pace, but made little impact.

Footnotes
ZAP MOTION chased the clear leader from the three path as that foe's closest pursuer around the turn, ranged up inside the final three sixteenths to bid
outside of his green counterpart, led at the furlong grounds, and held firmly while putting that foe to a bit of tight quarters late. RUNPAT set a clear pace in
the two path around the turn, but lost action while greenly resenting a right handed crop inside the final three sixteenths, which allowed for an outer ZAP
MOTION to forge a narrow advantage approaching the final furlong, fought on through the late stages, but failed to reclaim even terms while being put to a
bit of tight quarters approaching the wire. SUPERCOOL tracked the leading pair from the inside, chased them along the rail through upper stretch before
shifting to their outside at the furlong grounds, and proved best of the rest. HE'S GOT THIS laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the five path in
midstretch, and chased evenly. JELLY NOUGAT took the turn in the three path while off of the pace, and failed to factor. RUNAWAY READY trailed along
the inside, and made little impact. OLD HICKORY laid close up inside of the leading pair early on, rated back approaching the nine sixteenths pole to shift
outside of those foes, but failed to keep pace shortly after and quickly lost many lengths of position, retreated to trail the field passing the five sixteenths
pole, then lacked a re-rally under strong urging in the final sixteenth.THE RIDER OF RUNPAT CLAIMED FOULD AGAINST THE RIDER OF ZAP MOTION
FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE CLOSING STAGES, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
MY BARILEY comfortably trailed the short field, gained three wide around the far turn, shifted a bit outwardly while ranging up to bid outside of ORDER FOR
PORKEY entering the final furlong, sparred with that foe while gaining a narrow advantage entering the final sixteenth, and held to the wire. ORDER FOR
PORKY prompted the pace two wide, vied at the five furlong pole, led at the three furlong pole, showed the way through upper stretch as an outer MY
BARILEY menaced, dueled with that foe at the furlong grounds, but was headed entering the final sixteenth, and fought on grudgingly to the wire.
TAKAFUMI (BRZ) stalked along the inside, chased in the two path around the far turn, along with an outer MY BARILEY while just behind the leaders, got
outkicked by that bidding foe turning for home, then kept on to chase the top pair through the final furlong. SILVER N LAI set the pace inside of a vying
ORDER FOR PORKY, but got headed by that foe at the three furlong pole, and yielded leaving the quarter pole.

Footnotes
OAK HILL SENIORITA pressed two wide from the three path, led with nine sixteenths remaining, showed the way via a clear margin around the far turn, and
held sway from a chasing outer rival through the lane. LUCKY LINDA tracked three wide, took aim on the clear leader turning for home, but only managed a
mild gain through the lane. BAD GAL RIRI bumped an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, inched closer in the four path around the far
turn, but leveled off before threatening. GERRIE LOU lagged well behind the field, reached tiring rivals approaching the far turn, took that turn three wide,
then stayed on well through the lane. LOOKING HOT stalked along the inside, then tired entering the lane. RECKLESS SERGEANT stalked three wide from
the four path around the first turn, chased the leader two wide around the far turn, but tired between horses passing the five sixteenths pole. MY AVANI
tracked two wide, but faded down the bacsktretch. JULIA'S CHANCE leaned inwardly, then was corrected with a firm right hand rein causing her to spot the
leaders multiple lengths at the start, raced far back inthe three path, and never got involved. SAYANOTHERPRAYER took a bump from an outer foe at the
start, set the pace in the two path and from a pair of rivals down the backstretch, but weakened with nine sixteenths to go, and stopped.
