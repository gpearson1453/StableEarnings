Footnotes
COMPLEXITY away well, lightly brushed in hind end at the start, but didn't mean much, hand ridden throughout in a measured win. BEYOND BEING broke
in and bumped rival at the start, steadily urged throughout while maintaining a straight path, unable to catch clean trip winner in a solid try. ANOTHER WAY
hopped and came away slow losing about a length and a half, hand ridden early, angled out three paths, past the eighth pole, and responded to finish
willingly. BOUJIE BELLA broke in two paths, rider fought with horse to avoid lugging out throughout, did not get to fully level. SEPERATE BLAST broke out
and bumped rival at the start, rider slightly hesitant having to race with rival close to him, SEPERATE BLAST wanted to get out and fought the rider which
caused very awkward strides late.

Footnotes
APOLITICAL PREMIER broke in, accelerated well while being brushed early, almost cleared midway, drifted out a path and a half late to win under a hand
ride throughout. CACTUS JACK bobbled at the start losing half a length, quickly leveled and gained on leader throughout while drifted out late in a game
effort. RUN BY YOUR CARTEL very fractious in the gate, rearing a couple times, broke in and bumped rival at the start, and failed to run a straight course
moving in and out slightly throughout while being outfinished late. INSIDER away cleanly, minor correction early and finished ok under a hand ride
throughout. CRYSTAL PRIZE off slow and bumped hard at the start, hesitated early while lacking a path, accelerated well under a hand ride, and finished
up under a hold. EL TIO ANGEL broke in, bumped rival early, lacked needed acceleration to hold path, once rival crossed over horse quit running and faded
to last while drifting in.

MISTER TORNADO away well, lugged in nearing the eighth pole, hard ridden throughout and held on while drifting in late. JUST A DASHA HERO away
clean and had a clear path throughout, hand ridden throughout in a solid effort while avoiding trouble. CATTAIL COVE carried in three paths at the start,
steadily gained on leaders to the wire under a hand ride. BAIL CZECH ducked in three paths at the start, recovered quickly to be up close and outkicked in
the late stages. CHOCOLATITO away cleanly, lacked needed acceleration to be up close, gaining on leader midway until leader lugged in and crowded him
to the wire. UP AND ATEM came away a step slow, lost path early, lugged out at the eighth pole and lacked rally when asked. STOLEN LIVES away well,
up close early, within range passing the sixteenth pole and took up when crowded late.
