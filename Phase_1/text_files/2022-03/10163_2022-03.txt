Footnotes
EXCEED SPEED LIMIT was just off of the early pace while saving ground through the turn, swung widest into the drive, was put to firm urging in
mid-stretch, responded in the late stages and made a final push to prevail. MEET THE SHERIFF stalked the pace three wide on the turn, gained ground into
the stretch, was outkicked by the winner but kept on to earn the nod for second. GREAT STORY broke sharply and was hustled to the front, set quick
fractions through the turn, was overtaken by the winner just inside of the sixteenth marker and was edged in the final strides for the place. EL TENAMPA
lacked early speed, was steered three wide along the turn and was not a factor. THATSABADBOY tracked the fast pace from a two wide path through the
turn and tired in the stretch. OASIS was a bit slow into stride leaving the break, chased from the rear through the turn and was never involved.

Footnotes
STATEFOREST was sent after an alert break and cleared the field into the first turn, was well rated through the backstretch run and into the far turn, was
kept to task in the final stages and held safely in the end over the oncoming runner-up. BANDEENA stalked the pace through the second turn, made a
steady gain on STATEFOREST in the stretch run but could not reel in the winner and held for second over an oncoming rival. NICOLE GRACE was
unhurried in the early going, advanced along the far turn two wide and continued that run into upper stretch but was outfinished in the drive, while clear of
the rest for third. GOOD TIME DOLLY settled just off of the pace, gained a bit of ground on the far turn three wide, continued that bid into the lane but
flattened out in the late stages. MANGOTANGO settled just off of the pace, lost ground along the second turn and did not mount a late rally.

SHOT OF A LIFETIME broke alertly and was sent to set the fractions, was well handled through the backstretch run, extended the lead into the stretch run
and pulled away in the end. FLY NIGHTLY saved all of the ground while just off of the pace, gained ground into the stretch run, was outkicked by the winner
in the late stages but was best of the rest. PREMIUM FOREST was unhurried in the early stages while saving ground, lacked a late bid in the drive but was
up in the final stages to claim the show. DUCHOSSOIS settled just off of the pace while outside of rivals and lacked a late response in the stretch run.
BOTTLE OF SMOKE attended to the moderate fractions through the second turn, was outrun into the stretch and weakened in the final stages. NOWHERE
MAN was four wide along the first turn, settled through the backstretch run, was three wide on the far turn, swung widest into the drive and did not offer a
late rally.

EARNEST hopped at the start and crowded BROKEN FINGER a bit at the break, settled just off of the early pace while saving ground, gained ground in
upper stretch, overtook BROKEN FINGER inside of the furlong marker and held safely in the end. ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT was pinched at the start, saved
ground while settling off of the pace, was in tight traffic on the second turn, lacked room in upper stretch but rallied in the end and kept on to secure second.
ALLEYCAT settled just off of the early pace while outside of horses, gained ground three wide on the second turn and continued that run in the drive to
close for third. INVERTIGO settled off of the pace while maintaining a two wide path, angled out in upper stretch and closed willingly in the final stages but
could not reel in the top trio. TOUGH IT OUT was away a bit slowly and was allowed to settle, was steered three wide along the far turn, gained ground into
the stretch but was outkicked in the end. BROKEN FINGER was bumped a bit by EARNEST at the start and then squeezed ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT leaving
the break, was sent to the front and set moderately quick fractions while being prompted, was caught inside of the furlong marker and weakened in the final
stages. UNPOSSIBLE was hustled leaving the break, stalked the pace through the second turn, lost ground into the drive and tired in the late stages.

UNRAPTURED settled off of the early pace, mounted a two wide bid on the second turn, gained ground in upper stretch, had a good late kick to get by his
stablemate and drew clear in the end. ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA stalked the pace through the backstretch run, took a narrow advantage nearing the
quarter-marker, edged clear into the drive, was overtaken by UNRAPTURED nearing the sixteenth marker and was best of the rest. C'MON MAN was
unhurried in the early stages, was steered three wide on the far turn, made a mild gain in the late stages but was outkicked by the top pair and was a clear
third over the rest. ELLAMIRA saved ground while settling just off of the pace and did not mount a late rally. NUESTRO ENGREIDO broke alertly and was
sent to the front, set pedestrian fractions while on a tight hold through the backstretch run, was overtaken by ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA nearing the
quarter-marker and gave way in the late stages. SEN SEN bobbled at the start, recovered nicely to be just off of the pace on the first turn, advanced along
the backstretch to come within aim nearing the half-mile marker, was three wide on the second turn, lost ground into the drive and tired in the final stages.

ICONIC SKY advanced in the early stages to press the pace three wide into the turn, took a narrow lead into the stretch run and dug in in the late stages to
prevail. JAYS ANGEL disputed the fast pace two wide between foes, gave a bit of ground to the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished in the final
stages, while holding for the place. PACIFIC ZIP was away a bit slowly and lacked early speed, was steered three wide along the turn, closed well in the
final furlong while showing some greenness in the end but was a clear third. VISIBLE HOPE took back in the early stages and saved ground into the turn,
improved position into the drive but was outkicked in the late going. MISS IVES was fractious in the gate, chased the early pace to the turn, lost position into
the stretch, checked off heels of an advancing rival leaving the furlong marker and lacked a late response. KEEPMEINTHE MOMENT broke a step slowly
then was hustled to the front in the early stages, disputed the pace through the turn, came under pressure at the top of the lane and faded in the late stages.

SEASIDE DANCER broke alertly and took back to track the fast fractions through the turn, closed on RAMONCITA LIGHT in upper stretch, found a
stubborn foe in that rival, shook free in the final sixteenth and edged clear in the end. BIG CHICK lacked early speed to the turn, advanced along the turn
four wide, rallied into the stretch run and could not reel in the winner but was up in time for the place. JENPIRESTRIKESBACK chased the early pace to the
turn, advanced three wide nearing the quarter-marker, closed in the drive and was just edged out for the place. RAMONCITA LIGHT took control of the early
pace from SEASIDE DANCER and set fast fractions through the turn, came under pressure from the winner in upper stretch, kept on against that foe and
stubbornly gave way in the end. JUMPING JILL FLASH saved ground while chasing the fast early pace, improved along the turn and weakened in the final
stages. NAMORITA was away a bit slowly, lacked early speed to the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
CARASYNTHIA was a bit slow into stride leaving the break, settled through the first half-mile while saving ground, was steered five wide along the second
turn, advanced into the drive, overtook SACRED BEAUTY inside of the furlong grounds and kicked clear in the end. REMEMBER SUE saved ground
throughout while just off of the pace, shifted out three wide for the drive, was outkicked by the winner in the final stages but kept on to be a clear runner-up.
SACRED BEAUTY stalked the early pace, made a middle move on the backstretch to contest the lead, dueled on the front end to the quarter-marker, was
collared by CARASYNTHIA inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished in the final stages, while clear of the rest for the show. BALL LASS was
unhurried in the early stages while saving ground, was steered four wide on the far turn, swung widest into the drive, improved position in upper stretch but
was outclosed in the end. GOLD RUSH GAL was fanned four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace while outside of rivals through the backstretch run,
advanced three wide on the second turn to come within aim and weakened in the drive. CHULA GIRL was sent in the early stages and contested the early
pace, took back to stalk the pace into the far turn, lost ground in tight quarters on the second turn and gave way in the final stages. CONFIDENCE BUILDER
was a bit rank and hard to place in the early stages, floated GOLD RUSH GAL four wide on the first turn, settled on the backstretch run while just off of the
pace, lost ground three wide on the second turn and tired in the stretch run. AUTISM INNOCENCE was sent leaving the break and contested the early pace
with CHULA GIRL, was engaged by SACRED BEAUTY nearing the half-mile marker and disputed the pace with that foe to the quarter-pole, lost ground into
the stretch and faded in the late going.

Footnotes
LESSONS OF AUTISM lacked early speed to the turn, was three wide approaching the quarter-marker, shifted out in upper stretch, closed fast in the final
furlong and surged in the final strides to prevail. GALAN GRAY was bumped by VANDENBERG leaving the break, chased the fast pace through the turn
from a four wide path, overtook UNION WAVE inside of the sixteenth-marker and was tagged in the final strides by the surging winner. UNION WAVE broke
sharply and was part of a four horse battle for the early lead to the turn, took a narrow advantage nearing the quarter-marker, extended the lead into the final
furlong, was caught nearing the sixteenth marker but kept on to be a clear third. LEAVEITONTHEFIELD took up soon after the break and lacked early
speed to the turn, was three wide while trailing along the bend, swung widest into the stretch run and while not able to reel in the leaders in the end showed
late interest through the lane. GALOPIN GOURMET contested the early pace to the turn while outside of rivals, pressed the leader through the turn three
wide, lost ground into the drive and weakened in the final stages. ONCE chased the fast pace from a ground saving position, advanced into the stretch run
and tired in the late stages. OLYMPIC SILVER dueled on the front end to the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker while two wide and faded in the
stretch. VANDENBERG bumped GALAN GRAY at the start, was part of a four horse duel for the lead into the turn, lost ground three wide on the turn,
stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off under his own power.
