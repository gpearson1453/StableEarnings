Footnotes
GRAMI'S BOY dueled for the lead from the inside, drew off on the turn and was clearly much the best in the end to be ridden out. IBERIAN RUNNER
dueled for the lead while two wide, was hard used then gave way but held the place safe in the end. TAPPIN' THE BLING stumbled at the start then was
settled, rallied inside on the turn and saved ground but was no menace in late stretch. STORMIN HANK was unhurried early then rallied four wide in the
stretch then closed ground willingly in late stretch. JUST HANGIN RIDGE chased the early pace while four wide into the turn, made a bid but was no
menace. TALK OF TEXAS was allowed to settled then raced on the inside in the stretch but was no threat. KING WITT was unhurried early and no factor.
RED BIRD'S STORM chased the early pace while three wide, was used up.
