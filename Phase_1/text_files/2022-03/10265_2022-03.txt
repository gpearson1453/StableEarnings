Footnotes
BERNALINHO broke a bit awkwardly and brushed CANYON CREST at the start, recovered to sit just off of the early pace, mounted a three wide bid into the
lane, could not completely shake free of BIG CITY BANE in the final sixteenth but made a good late push to prevail. BIG CITY BANE was sent after
breaking alertly and set moderate fractions through the second turn, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker, stayed in range of the winner in the
final sixteenth but was outfinished in the end while besting the rest. KALINE stalked the pace outside of rivals, advanced four wide on the far turn, was
outkicked in the drive but kept on to be a clear third. JEDI KNIGHT attended to the pace from a two wide path, vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker
and weakened in the final stages. PURR CAT settled off of the pace while saving ground and was not a threat. CANYON CREST was brushed at the start
by the winner, lacked early speed, saved ground to the far turn and did not mount a late rally.

Footnotes
GINGERDOODLE saved ground in the early going while settling just off of the pace, was unhurried into the second turn, was roused at the top of the
stretch, found room inside in the final furlong and made a good late run to edge clear in the end. LEIGH ANN was away alertly and set the pedestrian pace
through the second turn, was confronted by MAYDAYSMOON leaving the turn, drifted out approaching the furlong marker, bumped MAYDAYSMOON, kept
on but was outfinished in the late stages, while holding for second over an oncoming rival. FILLY PELLI settled outside of rivals on the first turn, advanced
on the second turn three wide, continued that run in the drive but was outclosed in the end and just missed for the place. MAYDAYSMOON attended to the
slow pace, closed on LEIGH ANN and confronted that rival in upper stretch, was bumped by LEIGH ANN when that one drifted out nearing the furlong
marker and weakened in the final stages. EASTER GRACE hopped at the start, recovered to sit just off of the early pace, lost ground on the second turn
and lacked a late rally. VALDINI saved ground on the first turn while unhurried, was steered four wide on the second turn and lacked a late bid in the stretch.
THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING LEIGH ANN AND MAYDAYSMOON IN UPPER STRETCH AND IN A
UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT LEIGH ANN DRIFTED APPROACHING THE FURLONG MARKER, BUMPED MAYDAYSMOON AND COST
MAYDAYSMOON THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING AND DISQUALIFIED LEIGH ANN FROM SECOND TO FOURTH.

Footnotes
SOMARA stalked the pace three wide, gained ground in upper stretch to confront SIMPLY PERFECT nearing the furlong grounds, could not completely
shake free from that rival, was put to firm urging in the late stages and dug in to prevail. OYSTER SHOOTER saved ground while chasing the early pace,
was put to firm urging in the final furlong and advanced along the inside to get up for second. SIMPLY PERFECT engaged with PULPIT SINGER leaving the
break and dueled with that rival on the front end through the turn, was confronted by the winner nearing the furlong marker, met that foe's bid but was
outfinished in the end and was edged out for the place. FRIEND OF AUTISM was bumped at the start and away a step slowly, chased the pace through the
turn while outside of rivals, gained in the stretch run but lacked the needed late response. PULPIT SINGER broke alertly and was sent to the front, dueled
for pace duties with SIMPLY PERFECT through the turn and tired in the stretch.

TROPICANA GIRL broke sharply and was hustled in the early going, disputed the pace with two rivals through the turn while carving out fast fractions,
shook free of the pressing rivals into the stretch run and opened a clear lead, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up and held to prevail. ARTISAN
DANCER chased the pace five wide on the turn, advanced in upper stretch, showed a bit of greenness in the late stages, mildly pressured the winner in the
final sixteenth and could not reel that one in but was best of the rest. COCORITA saved ground while chasing the fast pace, improved position into the drive,
was outkicked by the top pair in the late going but was up for third in the end. LAST STARFIGHTER chased the early pace, was six wide on the turn and
finished evenly in the stretch drive. JOHNEEDWNTHESTREET chased the pace four wide on the turn and lacked a late kick in the stretch. CIRCLE OF
ROYALTY lagged in the early stages after breaking a bit slowly, shifted out in mid-stretch and passed tiring foes in the final stages. BEAUTYINTHEBEAST
disputed the fast early pace, lost ground into the stretch run and gave way in the late stages. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN contested the early pace while two
wide between rivals into the turn, maintained position nearing the quarter-marker, was outrun in upper stretch and faded in the late going.

Footnotes
FINAL FINAL was unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the second turn, mounted a five wide bid into the stretch run, took a narrow lead into
the final sixteenth and gamely held over the oncoming runner-up. MEMO DADDY (CHI) saved ground while settling just off of the early pace, was steered
four wide off of the second turn, closed in the final stages, split foes leaving the sixteenth-marker and was nipped on the line for the win, while clear of the
rest. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) settled off of the early pace, was roused three wide into the drive, gained ground in upper stretch, was outkicked in the late
stages but got up in the end for third. HEAT N REHEAT was forwardly placed while three wide, advanced in upper stretch to vie for the lead nearing the
furlong marker, was outfinished by the top three in the end and just missed for the show. PAINT ME LUCKY attended to the moderate pace, vied for the
lead nearing the furlong marker and gave way in the late going. UNTHROTTLED broke alertly and was hustled to the front, extended the lead nearing the
quarter-marker, came under pressure in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages.

Footnotes
JAYS ANGEL was sent leaving the start and contested the pace to the turn, pressed the fast pace to the quarter-marker, took a clear lead into the final
furlong, was headed by the runner-up while all out in the final strides and just held on to prevail. TIZ AN EMMA B chased the early pace outside of rivals,
gained ground into the stretch run, closed well in the final sixteenth, headed JAYS ANGEL in the final strides and was nipped on the wire in a good debut.
ACCORDING TO JUDY settled off of the fast early pace, saved ground through the turn, advanced in upper stretch, lacked room nearing the furlong
marker, found a seam inside of the final furlong, gained ground in the late stages but could not get by the top pair. ASHLEY'S RAINBOW was away slowly,
was void of early speed into the turn, shifted out in the stretch run and showed late interest in the drive but was unable to reel in the top three. OH TRUTHY
broke sharply and was hustled to dispute the early pace, set fast fractions through the turn while being pressed by the winner, was overtaken nearing the
furlong marker and tired in the late going. UNBRIDLE THE WILD was hustled to contest the fast early pace, lost position three wide on the turn and faded in
the final stages. DARK INTENT had an awkward beginning and was away slowly, lacked early speed and was not a factor.

ARTEMUS GORDON settled just off of the early pace, mounted a five wide bid into the stretch run, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, was put to
firm hand urging in the final stages and made a late push to prevail. HEAVEN SHINES chased the fast pace three wide between rivals, closed in upper
stretch to vie for the lead nearing the furlong marker, was outfinished by the winner in the end but was best of the rest. NORTH SEA lacked early speed,
swung five wide into the drive and made a steady gain through the late going to secure third. WALKING BOSS stalked the pace four wide through the turn,
lost ground into the stretch and gave way. GALLANT OAK pressed the fast pace, lost position into the drive and weakened in the late stages. HANS
GRUBER was away a step slowly, chased the pace from the inside and tired. FULL OF LIFE broke sharply and was sent to the front, set quick fractions
while being pressed through the turn, lost contact leaving the bend and faded late.

Footnotes
TOM'S SURPRISE settled off of the early pace, was roused four wide on the second turn, quickly overtook the leading pair inside of the furlong marker and
drew clear in the end. FUENTE (GB) saved ground while settling off of the pace, improved position on the second turn and continued that run into the
stretch drive, was outkicked by the winner but closed late for second. TED was hustled after the break and set contested fractions on the first turn, extended
the lead along the backstretch run, felt pressure in upper stretch and was outfinished by the top pair, while clear of the rest for the show. SHADOW SPHINX
was unhurried while two deep early, was roused on the second turn and mounted a five wide bid at the top of the lane, could not sustain that run and gave
way. MOHAWK KING (IRE) attended to the moderate fractions, closed on the pacesetter nearing the quarter-marker and into upper stretch and tired in the
late going. READY SAY GO settled off of the pace, advanced on the second turn and weakened in the late stages. WINE AND WHISKY settled off of the
pace while in the second flight, saved ground into the far turn and did not mount a late bid. SHADRACK saved ground while settling off of the pace and
lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
AMAAZA saved ground while stalking the early quick pace, advanced along the inside in upper stretch and had a good late kick in the final sixteenth to
prevail. ENGEE OMBEE was away well and showed good early speed while dueling on the front end through the turn, took a narrow advantage into the final
furlong, could not hold off the fast closing winner in the end but held on for the place. GRAZIN AT SUNRISE was forwardly placed while three wide, gained
ground in upper stretch to vie for the lead nearing the furlong marker but was outclosed in the final stages and just edged out for second. BONNIE BRAE
chased the quick pace from the second flight, gained ground in upper stretch but lacked the needed late response in the final sixteenth. SURFLINE chased
the pace two wide in the early stages, shifted out eight wide for the drive and closed willingly in the late going. MS MOAB was shuffled at the start and was
off slowly, lacked speed to the turn, saved ground into the stretch run, improved in the final furlong and was outkicked in the end. ORISSA hopped at the
start then was squeezed leaving the break, recovered to chased the pace five wide on the turn, gained ground nearing the furlong marker and faltered late.
ICY BREEZE lacked early speed to the turn, was steered seven wide for the drive and finished evenly. FROSTY DOLCE chased the pace from the second
flight while two wide, lacked room leaving the quarter-pole and into upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. SOO BROOKLYN chased the early pace
four wide on the turn, swung six wide for the drive and gave way in the late going. DEAREST BARBARA showed good early speed while contesting the
early pace, ran in tandem with ENGEE OMBEE to the quarter-marker while carving out fast fractions, lost ground in upper stretch and tired in the late
stages.
