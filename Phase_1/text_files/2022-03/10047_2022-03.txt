Footnotes
BOSSY CAT chased well behind the leading pair while racing outside of GOLD FELLOW, edged closer to the leaders past the five eighths, rallied three
wide into the far turn, circled past the dueling pair near the three eighths, raced clear from past the five eighths, and drew away under moderate handling.
GOLD FELLOW chased inside of BOSSY CAT while racing well off the dueling pair, continued to chase patiently down the back straight, was pushed along
near the half, tracked the leading trio in the three to four path around the far turn, swung out near the center of the course under a drive, could not match
BOSSY CAT but chased on best of the rest. ICHIGO dueled inside of SILVER TOKEN, could not go with BOSSY CAT when he swept by near the five
sixteenths, chased on under a drive three to four paths off the inside down the lane, was passed for place midstretch and drifted out late. SILVER TOKEN
dueled outside of ICHIGO from the start, had no answer when passed by BOSSY CAT near the five sixteenths, and weakened in the lane. JOZANI R V F
trailed, raced into the lane inside of the weakening LOVEDISC, drifted out in the lane and never got involved. LOVEDISC settled in second last, began to
weaken down the back straight, floated into the lane near the center of the track under a drive and had no response.

Footnotes
PROTECTTHEWITNESS was placed on the lead, set the pace uncontested down the backstretch, continued to lead in the two to three path while prompted
by ANIPPE around the turn, shook that foe off in upper stretch and proved best while kept to task until just inside the sixteenth. ANIPPE tracked the pace
outside of WILLING, edged forward to press in the three to four path directly outside of PROTECTTHEWITNESS on the turn, proved no match from that foe
from the three sixteenths, angled in late and chased on well enough to prove second best. SOULSTONE chased toward the rear, improved in the five path
around the far turn, was driven past the quarter, swung out near the center of the track into the lane, continued to improve to midstretch, but leveled out in
the final furlong. WILLING tracked the pace inside of ANIPPE early, began to lose ground on the leading pair from the seven sixteenths, was urged in the
two path around that bend, was driven in the two to three path into the lane, offered no rally and drifted out midstretch. AFTER ALPHA settled near the rear,
continued with the rear group in the four path on the turn, lacked a rally when driven in the lane and drifted out late. SULTRY SKY was urged early but raced
at the rear, continued to be urged while trailing in the six path on the far turn, was driven toward the center of the track into the stretch, lacked a rally and
was carried out late by AFTER ALPHA.

Footnotes
SIMMONS chased two wide early, edged forward to track between horses near the nine sixteenths, bid outside of ALL TACKED UP near the three eighths,
was shaken off into the lane, continued to pursue the leader while racing outside of TRENDING UP, gained well on the leader in the final sixteenth and got
up in time. ALL TACKED UP set the pace, continued clear in the two to three path on the far turn, was engaged by SIMMONS past the three eighths but
shook him off into the lane, shortened stride in the final sixteenth of a mile and was caught in the final strides. TRENDING UP chased inside, edged forward
to the inside of the tracking flight near the nine sixteenths, tracked the pace inside foes in the three path around the turn, continued to track in range behind
ALL TACKED UP in the lane but lacked the needed kick to reel him in. LONG TOM settled at the rear, was pushed along into the far turn, improved up the
inside, angled out into lane in the five path, angled inward in upper stretch, and chased on to prove best of the rest. CRYPT floated three wide into the first
turn, settled back to the rear of the main group for the backstretch run, was pushed along inside foes around the far turn and improved position in the three
to four path, but could not sustain the bid into the lane. LEAVE 'EM LOADED broke well outside early, tracked the early pace outside of GOSIGNAL, began
to flatten out between horses from the nine sixteenths, faded in the seven path around the far turn and was no further threat in the lane. COOL COMEDIAN
chased three wide through the first turn, kept on three to four wide down the back straight, continued in range three wide around the far turn, but flattened
from the five sixteenths. TUCKERTON BAY was hung four wide on the first turn, chased five wide down the backstretch, began to weaken in the eight path
from the three eighths and was no further factor in the lane. GOSIGNAL tracked the leader inside of LEAVE 'EM LOADED early and began to fade between
horses near the half.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S PEEBLES settled at the rear, raced at the inside of the rear pair into the turn, began to improve in the two path around the turn, sustained her
rally into the lane, altered out past the three sixteenths, continued to improve, and got up outside of BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD in the final strides.
BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD tracked the leader down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, continued to give chase in upper stretch, gradually
reeled in UNO TIGRESS in the final furlong, poked her nose in front between horses in the final forty yards, but was nailed in the last jumps. UNO TIGRESS
set the pace down the backstretch and in the two to three path on the turn, continued on a clear lead into the final sixteenth, but was caught from the outside
by BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD in the final forty yards. INTROSPECTION tracked the leading pair down the backstretch, floated out to the five path on the turn
while continuing to track the leading pair, was pushed along near the three eighths and driven in upper stretch, and lacked the needed rally. IL MIO AMORE
broke outward, settled near the rear, raced into the turn outside of KITTEN'S PEEBLES, trailed in the four to five path around the bend, was driven in upper
stretch, had no response and was allowed to trail home.

FLATTERING RUBY vied for the lead outside of SNIFF, took the lead past the seven sixteenths, raced clear in the two path on the turn, floated out toward
the center of the track into the lane but nonetheless maintained her lead, drifted in slightly midstretch, and held. SEEKING THE DREAM broke outward,
tracked in close range of the leading pair down the back straight, was pushed along in the three path around the turn, continued to give chase to the leader
in the lane, kept on willingly under a drive but proved second best. TIMELY TRADITION settled at the rear of a close-knit pack, continued to chase in the
two path on the turn, was urged to improve between horses past the three eighths, went to a drive nearing the furlong mark, but lacked the needed kick to
keep up with the top two. SNIFF vied inside of FLATTERING RUBY to the seven sixteenths, could not keep pace from there despite being asked, weakened
inside and was empty for the drive.

BETTER BOOGIE was sent for speed inside his foes while racing a bit keenly early, edged away from the rest of the field around the backstretch, continued
clear on the lead in the three path on the far turn, drifted out in the lane but still held clear to the finish. A T M AWESOME hung four wide into the clubhouse
turn, took up between horses past the three quarters, settled to the rear outside of OSCAR WINNER from there, was pushed along in the three path from
second last around the far turn, floated out near the center of the track and was driven between horses in upper stretch, and kept on with interest to prove a
clear second best. OSCAR WINNER raced two wide into the first turn just behind the pacesetter, settled to the rear of the pack into the backstretch inside of
A T M AWESOME, trailed at the rear in the three path around the far turn, swung out near the center of the track outside of A T M AWESOME into the lane,
and passed tiring horses outside for the show. RIPPOLINO raced five wide into the first turn, continued to chase four deep around much of the bend, got his
place past the three quarters to track the leader outside of MIAMI MUMBLES, continued to chase while positioned in the three path on the far turn as
BETTER BOOGIE edged away, could not rerally on BETTER BOOGIE into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. MIAMI MUMBLES raced three
wide between horses into the first turn, tracked the leader inside of RIPPOLINO past the three quarters, continued to save ground while chasing BETTER
BOOGIE around the far turn, proved no match as that foe drew away, and weakened inside.

Footnotes
LADY BREXIT broke a bit slowly, raced two wide into the clubhouse turn, prompted the pace outside of COLOR FORCE, engaged her in earnest
approaching the half, vied on the lead until the seven sixteenths, began to edge away under her own power, and drew off at will in the lane. COLOR FORCE
set the pace inside while prompted by LADY BREXIT, vied inside of her from near the half, could not go with her past the seven sixteenths, continued to
chase under a drive in the lane and proved best of the rest. DISCO PARTY tracked in range outside of the leading trio, was no match for them from the half,
chased them in the two to three path on the far turn, drifted out in midstretch, lacked the needed kick but kept on narrowly well enough for show. TUXEDO
LEMON settled at the rear of a compact field, raced in the three to four path outside of DISCO PARTY in the rear flight around the far turn, was driven into
upper stretch, angled in midstretch, and lacked the needed rally.
