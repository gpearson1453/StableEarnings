Footnotes
NIGHT CAP was urged three deep between foes dictating the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, shifted inwards on the turn, then edged
forward in the closing stages to prevail under firm left handed encouragement. DON'T GET KHOZY was rated off the first flight racing well off the inside on
the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch while carrying out SPECIAL PRINCESS but continued with interest to close the gap late.
WHOLEBODEMEISTER, forwardly placed inside foes stalking just off the leaders, advanced inside foes to prompt the pacesetter racing through the turn but
weakened in late stages. TAP DANCE FEVER, in touch four wide stalking the pacesetter through the backstretch, was urged to bid three deep nearing
upper stretch but faded in late stages. SPECIAL PRINCESS tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, was carried out five wide in upper
stretch and had no rally. PINK SHOELACES, urged between foes prompting the pacesetter in the opening stages, gave way racing through the turn.

Footnotes
CAJUN CASANOVA tipped off the inside in the opening stages while being urged disputing the pace inside a rival through the backstretch, edged forward
nearing upper stretch, shifted to the four path entering the lane and widened the margin late under pressure. BREWMEISTER settled inside foes racing
through the backstretch, saved ground on the turn while gathering momentum, was urged to challenge along the rail racing through the stretch but couldn't
gain even terms with the winner while edging a rival for the place honors. HE'S SMOKIN NOW settled between foes in the opening stages, was prompted to
gain position between rivals bidding inside the pacesetter racing into the stretch but was outkicked for second. JEOPARDY JAMES, off slowly, then bumped
at the start, was prompted to advance three deep racing into the turn to gain a position just off the leaders nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. SELF
TAUGHT broke inwards bumping JEOPARDY JAMES, was righted to track the leaders four wide to the turn and steadily faded into the lane. A ROSE FOR
RAVEN angled inwards while being urged forcing the pace outside the eventual winner through the backstretch into the turn and gave way into upper
stretch. DECIMATOR settled between foes on the backstretch and dropped out nearing lane.

ROCKY DICE tracked off the second flight in early stages, shifted out racing into the turn, split foes three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a
steady late response to reel in the pacesetter and go clear in time under firm handling. STREET LAMP was urged inside rivals pursuing the pacesetter
through the backstretch, tipped out racing through the turn and continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors in time. RUNAWAY TOM
sprinted clear of the field on the backstretch, held sway on a commanding margin to midstretch but faltered in the final sixteenth. THAT'S MY BOI TOY
broke awkwardly, settled between foes, angled to the inside nearing the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position.
MARSICO angled inwards to track off the second flight racing to the turn and continued evenly between foes gaining some position. OUTSTANDING
ISLAND tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight, shifted inside racing through the turn and came up empty late. EL FANTASMA, caught four
wide in second flight racing through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. GOLDEN WONDER settled outside foes in early stages and
failed to menace. AS DE ORO COCO broke readily but quickly dropped back. JAQUE MATE COCO, caught seven wide in the opening stages, soon
dropped out. CLASSIC ESCAPE RAN LOOSE, THEN EXITED THE COURSE PRIOR TO THE START, NECESSITATING HIS LATE SCRATCH.

Footnotes
JACKSON STRONG vied for command between foes from the outset, edged forward to a narrow advantage leaving the turn and held grudgingly to the end
under pressure. CAPTAIN exchanged bumps with SPANISH SOUL at the start, was settled last to the turn, angled out five wide to split foes entering upper
stretch, then produced a solid late response to close the gap while prevailing for second. WHISKEY PLANK, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the
outset to upper stretch, kept on willingly while just failing to contain the top pair. NANTUCKETER, off a step slowly, gradually gained position three deep
between foes racing into the stretch, then switched out in the closing stages to gain some position. MIAMI CHROME settled outside foes on the backstretch,
was fanned six wide into upper stretch and made some belated progress. CPOWER joined the pace five wide in early stages, shifted inwards entering the
turn to press the issue three wide into upper stretch but faded late. SPANISH SOUL exchanged bumps at the start, pulled his way between foes to gain a
position in second flight, then was carried out, then steadied off NANTUCKETER in late stages. TINKER'S PAL proved no threat. JIMMY THE KID flashed
brief pace four wide between foes but dropped back early. EXCELLENT MARK vied briefly three deep between foes and steadily faded nearing the stretch.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF SPANISH SOUL LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF NANTUCKETER WHILE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED NANTUCKETER
FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM SEVENTH.

Footnotes
FENWICK broke readily, was urged to the lead along the inside racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the second bend, then
shook clear racing into upper stretch, widening late under some mild hand urging. COMMANDPERFORMANCE, forwardly placed three deep attending the
pace in the opening half, shifted in racing through the far turn while being prompted to challenge but proved no match. ALWAYS ABOVE, off last, settled
near the inside to the backstretch, was prompted to split foes racing into the far turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest
while being just outkicked for second. KING OF CHAOS angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing to the far turn but came up empty in the
drive. ROYAL COURT tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight and steadily faded nearing the lane. FLATFORD MILL, reserved off the second flight
along the inside, dropped back early. EXXEL, urged between foes prompting the pace in the opening half, gave way between foes racing into the far turn.
PICCADILLY settled outside foes in early stages, was caught five wide after a half and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
GINA ROMANTICA was rated dropping off the second flight in early stages while angling inwards on the backstretch, swung outside rivals racing into the
turn commencing a steady advance five wide nearing upper stretch, then rallied smartly to the front four deep in the closing stages to wrest the advantage in
time under firm left handed encouragement. SPIKED tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight racing to the turn, continued with a steady, three
wide advance to challenge for command in late stages but was outkicked by the winner. BROOKWOOD HILLS broke readily, angled inwards prompting the
pace outside a rival racing into the turn, took over from that rival nearing midstretch but was collared by the top pair. LA CASA D'ORO tipped a bit off the
inside tracking just off the first flight racing into the turn and continued evenly in late stages. CROSSTALK sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside,
dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch and gave way late. BIRTHDAY TIME tracked off the second flight outside rivals, made brief progress
four wide between foes on the turn but lacked the needed late bid. TWO WORDS, pulling inside rivals racing just behind the second flight on the
backstretch, was steadied avoiding tight quarters racing into the turn and soon gave way. LADY CREATIVE settled outside foes in early stages and proved
no threat. SWEETS MAKER ducked in at the start losing position to the leaders and failed to menace thereafter. RAGTIME BELLE, away slowly, proved no
threat. AMOR COCO proved no factor.

Footnotes
BLEECKER STREET, reserved while angling inside leaving the chute, continued unhurried along the inside racing into the far turn, swung out four wide
nearing upper stretch, took charge leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm encouragement. ROCKY SKY (IRE) angled to the inside tracking
just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, tipped out three wide nearing upper stretch while being urged to challenge, couldn't contain the winner but
edged rivals for the place honors late. GLADYS, urged dictating the pace outside a rival, then a bit off the rail racing through the backstretch, held sway to
midstretch but yielded to the top pair late. LADY SPEIGHTSPEARE, urged along the rail prompting a rival's pace, switched outside that foe nearing upper
stretch but faded in the drive. LOVELY LUCKY, reserved along the inside from the outset to the far turn, swung out racing into upper stretch but made no
real impression. RUNAWAY RUMOUR, off a bit slowly, settled last to the backstretch, was fanned five wide into the lane and never proved a serious threat.
JEZEBEL'S KITTEN was rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the far turn and emptied out into the stretch. TAKE CHARGE RO was rated off
the second flight inside a rival racing to the far turn and faded into the stretch. NANTUCKET RED ducked out at the start, was prompted to gain a position
outside a rival in second flight and gave way racing through the far turn.

SCALDING tracked the pacesetter three deep from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, moved to close the gap on that rival while shifting
inwards racing through the far turn, bid for command between foes nearing upper stretch, continued in a three way skirmish past midstretch and wrested a
narrow advantage in time under firm right handed encouragement. CODY'S WISH, off a step slow, tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the
backstretch, steadily drew on terms with the leaders three deep racing into upper stretch, contested the issue outside the eventual winner to late stages but
was outkicked. DYNAMIC ONE settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, gained some position just behind the leaders on the far turn,
shifted to the four path entering the stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share. MISCHIEF AFOOT settled along the inside racing to the
backstretch, switched out three wide nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick while racing between foes through the stretch. WOLFIE'S
DYNAGHOST broke sharply, dictated the pace on a clear margin to the far turn, shifted off the inside while being roused to resist the winner's bid past the
furlong marker but gave out late. GREATEST HONOUR tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch and
steadily faded entering the far turn. TUNE IN, urged to a forward placing between foes tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, gave way racing
through the far turn.

DOLCE ZEL (FR) was rated along the inside stalking just off the first flight to the backstretch, tipped off the inside to bid three deep racing into upper stretch
and wrested the advantage from SPICER in time under left handed pressure. The latter gained a forward placing attending a rival's pace under light rating
racing to the backstretch, took over nearing upper stretch, then resisted the winner's bid to the end while coming up second best. ON ALERT, bumped at
the start, was settled last while being guided to the inside, saved ground to upper stretch, then split foes just off the inside to gain a share in the closing
stages. MRS. BARBARA tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch, then swung four wide racing through the stretch while
continuing with interest to gain some position. SWEET DUTCHESS tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight in the opening half, shifted three wide
on the far turn gaining striking distance nearing upper stretch but soon flattened out. ALITTLELOVEANDLUCK broke outwards bumping ON ALERT, was
righted to track off the second flight outside foes, raced four wide on the far turn to upper stretch and faded. ROUGHLY A DIAMOND settled near the inside
early and failed to menace. PRINCESS ELIN, urged inside a rival disputing the pace, dueled for command to the far turn and gave way. AMBITIEUSE
angled inwards to track off the second flight between foes to the far turn and faded into upper stretch.

Footnotes
HEAVEN STREET tracked the pacesetter outside a rival from just out of striking distance to the backstretch, tipped out three wide racing into upper stretch
and responded to stout pressure to edge forward in time. BENS MALICE, reserved along the inside, saved ground on the far turn, was urged to advance
along the rail entering the stretch and couldn't quite match the winner's kick. FORT WASHINGTON settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the far turn,
swung out five wide midway through the bend while being prompted to advance and continued willingly to gain a share. NIGHT JUMPER tracked the
pacesetter inside the eventual winner as part of the second flight, tipped out racing into upper stretch to bid between foes but lacked the needed final kick.
WAKE SURF was rated off the second flight inside foes racing to the far turn, tipped off the inside while briefly awaiting an opening racing into the stretch,
then continued evenly between foes late. KITTEN MISCHIEF tracked off the second flight between foes, awaited an opening racing into upper stretch and
never gained contention. ELECTROSTATIC tracked off the second flight off the inside in the opening half and faded between foes into the stretch.
GINGRICH tracked three deep behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide nearing upper stretch but proved empty in the drive.
GRUMLEY sprinted to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace to far turn and gave out racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
CLASSIC CAUSEWAY broke sharply, dictated the pace to the backstretch racing a bit off the rail while in hand, maintained the advantage under confident
handling through the far turn, tipped out to the three path in upper stretch and came under some right handed pressure to widen the margin in the closing
stages. GRANTHAM, urged to a forward placing along the inside, tracked just off the pacesetter nearest the rail, saved ground throughout and edged rivals
for the place honors in late stages. SHIPSATIONAL raced four wide to the backstretch while just off the second flight, was prompted to advance in that path
nearing the far turn, continued in pursuit of the winner three wide between foes into the stretch and prevailed for a share at the wire. GOLDEN GLIDER
angled to the rail racing to the backstretch tracking behind the second flight, shifted off the inside on the far turn while being prompted to advance, angled
four wide near midstretch and displayed some late interest to close the gap on the leaders nearing the wire. TRADEMARK tracked the pace between foes in
second flight racing to the far turn, then faded between rivals in late stages. SPIN WHEEL ducked out at the start while getting away last, settled into stride
off the inside racing to the backstretch, then continued with an even effort to gain some position between foes racing into the stretch. BELGRADE tracked
off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to advance while caught four wide racing into the far turn and steadily faded nearing
the lane. GIANT GAME, reluctant to load in the starting gate, tracked the pacesetter three wide between foes in second flight for a half and gave way racing
into the far turn. HAPPY BOY ROCKET, shuffled out of tight quarters at the break, settled well off the leaders to the backstretch, switched outside foes after
a half, was caught five wide racing into the far turn and never mounted a serious challenge. MAJOR GENERAL stumbled at the start, was settled outside
foes racing to the backstretch and dropped out early.

Footnotes
GET SERIOUS, angled to the rail leaving the chute tracking just off the leaders, saved ground into the far turn, tipped out nearing upper stretch, gained a
narrow advantage midstretch and held BALI BELLE safe to the end under firm handling. The latter angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing
to the backstretch, swung out three wide in upper stretch while advancing to challenge but was outkicked. PURE COUNTRY, off a bit slowly, settled near
the inside racing to the far turn, then split rivals just off the inside in the closing stages to prevail for a share. POINT WELL TAKEN settled outside foes
racing to the backstretch, angled inside on the far turn and continued with interest inside foes to improve position. CURIOUSLY was rated between foes off
the second flight to the backstretch and continued evenly into the lane. UNBRIDLED ENSIGN switched outside rivals early, raced four wide through the far
turn and had no closing bid. AFRAID NOT settled outside foes, was fanned seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. STANDUP COMEDIENNE,
forwardly placed outside a rival racing to the first turn, pulled her way clear on the backstretch, set the pace to upper stretch and abruptly gave out. LAUGH
AND PLAY, caught wide throughout, proved no threat. INDIA CARIBE hopped at the start while breaking slowly and trailed the field to the stretch. ZENA
CROWN tracked off the first flight outside foes and faded racing into the far turn. EDYE'S CANDY, urged to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn,
continued in pursuit of the pacesetter to the second bend, saved ground through the far turn, then was taken up entering upper stretch.
