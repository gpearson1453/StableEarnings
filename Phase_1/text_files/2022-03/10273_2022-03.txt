Footnotes
MINISTER SHANE stalked the leaders off the rail, took aim at the top pair three wide entering the stretch, drew alongside the runner-up at the eighth pole
and drove clear. OUBABE went up to vie for command from inside, dueled along the rail around the bend, cleared briefly in upper stretch before being
pressured by the winner with a furlong left to run and yielded in deep stretch. SQUARE NOT broke slow and inward, lost his path behind ARICKAREE soon
after then was taken outside, went two wide into the turn, swung out leaving the bend, drifted inward in the lane and finished well for a clear third. JOHNNY
PAYCHECK angled inside to chase along the rail, got put in tight by rival at the seven-sixteenths pole, angled out to the two path around the bend, forced to
check when SQUARE NOT drifted inward in midstretch and was ridden out to the wire. HOT LEGS ROMOLO vied for the lead from between rivals, dueled
outside foe in the two path around the bend and weakened in the lane. ARICKAREE traveled at the back outside a rival, took the turn two then three wide
and made no impact. TAKE THE TWO TEN was off slow and bothered by rival at the start, traveled along the inside then two wide into the stretch and failed
to menace. PHILOSOPHER'S TONE chased between then angled to the rail on the turn, saved ground to the stretch and faded. ALL FOUR WINDS was off
slow from outside, sent for the lead and vied three deep to the turn, lugged out around the bend then was wrangled back to the three path and tired.

Footnotes
INDULGE had early speed inside IKIGAI then took back briefly and angled outside that rival, went up to press the pace between rivals into the turn, vied for
command around the bend, took over into the stretch, held a short lead over FIRST CLASS DAD through the final furlong and gamely prevailed. FIRST
CLASS DAD forwardly placed four deep up the backstretch, vied for the lead three deep on the turn, battled outside INDULGE down the stretch, dug in late
but could not get by. SPECIAL RIDE became fractious in the gate, raced up close on the inside of the pacesetter then got shuffled back at the
sevens-sixteenths pole, angled to the four path around the turn, rallied while drifting in through the lane and kept gaining to the wire. IKIGAI came away well
and took control, set the pace under pressure into the turn, vied for command along the rail around the bend, lost the lead into the stretch and weakened in
the final furlong. BELMONT BILL broke out and bumped rival, checked hard behind INDULGE early, chased three to four wide on the turn and could not
rally. AMADMADWORLD got bumped back leaving the gate, started to climb while trailing early on, went three then two wide around the turn and was not a
factor.

TMORROWISALONGTIME stalked the leader around the first turn, went up to apply pressure in the middle stages, vied three wide into the lane, took over
at the three-sixteenths pole and drove clear. THE GINGER QUEEN (IRE) stumbled leaving the gate, pulled on the first turn and became rank near the
five-eighths pole, remained inside then bid along the rail entering the stretch but got outkicked by the winner while gaining the place. ROYALLY COMMAND
sped clear and was rated in the two path, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, vied two wide into the stretch, lost the lead at the top of the
stretch and faltered between rivals. BLOSSOMING was off slow and broke out, traveled in the two path then became rank near the five-eighths marker,
chased off the rail, four wide into the lane and needed to find more in the final furlong. SWEET WORKOUT stumbled in the beginning, tucked inside for the

Footnotes
ALLABOUTTHEMONEY stalked three wide around the first turn, bid three deep on the far turn, vied three wide into the stretch, took over nearing the eighth
pole, cleared midstretch and drew away. WARRENS CANDY MAN stalked in the two path then moved to the inside, angled four wide leaving the second
bend, bid four deep in upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner inside the furlong grounds but edged out PRIMER DIMER for the place honors.
PRIMER DIMER broke well and took control from inside, set the pace up the backstretch, held a short lead on the far turn before losing the advantage
approaching the quarter pole, kept on from inside through the final furlong and missed the place. STAR SAILOR was closest in pursuit in the two path,
moved up to press from outside, took over nearing the quarter pole, vied between leaving the far turn, lost command in upper stretch and flattened to fourth.
GRANADA FLAVOR was off slow in the beginning, traveled along the rail into the first turn then angled out to the three path, rounded the second turn four
wide and failed to threaten. MONGOL ALTAI went three wide around the first turn, trailed five wide into the stretch and was always outrun.

Footnotes
AUGUSTA MELODY showed early speed and crossed over to the inside, took pressure again by the same rival up the backstretch, shook free at the
five-sixteenths pole, led clear through the final furlong and held safely. DONCIC angled down to the inside, bumped with rival into the turn, remained inside
then tipped to the two path in the lane and finished well to prove second best. JOHNNY PODRES dropped back off the pace early, went between rivals into
the turn, got blocked behind a rival then angled to the inside on the turn and finished evenly for the third. COMMANDER KHAI checked off the heels of
HIGHLY DISTORDED early, was up close outside the top pair then chased three deep around the turn and flattened to fourth. SCRATCHY APACHE broke
slow then steadied behind rival soon after the start, trailed two wide into the lane, moved out and improved placings. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE sat off the
pace and moved inside, angled out in upper stretch and failed to menace. HIGHLY DISTORTED was off a bit slow then sped to the front, lost action briefly
crossing back onto the grass, steadied when crowded by AUGUSTA MELODY near the nine-sixteenths pole, switch out and went up to press that rival from
outside, could not keep pace past the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the drive and weakened.

Footnotes
SET SAIL sped to the front with company alongside while in the two path, put away BLETCHELY PARK at the five-sixteenths pole but was tested by ONE
MORE BID shortly after, cleared that rival past the quarter pole, then drew off in the lane under mild urging and was ridden out to the wire. ONE MORE BID
showed early speed three deep of four wide into the first turn, angled to the three path around that bend, bid three wide midway around the far turn, could
not keep up past the quarter pole and stayed on to secure second. Q B ONE raced two wide around the first turn then angled inside, steered out on the
second bend to advance outside rivals, came four wide into the stretch and was along for third. MAURITIUS chased three then two wide on the first turn,
angled to the rail on the far turn and faded. BLETCHLEY PARK pressed the pace from outside, could not keep up with five-sixteenths remaining and tired in
the lane. GUSTAV suffered a mild shuffle and angled in prior to the first turn, steered out around that bend, dropped to last in the middle stages, weakened
on the far turn, eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
FAST BUCK broke slow then rushed up the inside, cleared the field up the backstretch, inched away around the turn, then powered away in the stretch.
ORTH bothered outside rival at the start, bumped repeatedly with DICK BEST early, chased inside through the turn, was no match for the winner and stayed
on to hold second. PRESS ON tracked the pace off the rail, went between rivals approaching the quarter pole, chased two wide into the lane and gained the
show. GRAZEN SUN got bumped and lost his path at the start, chased along the rail off the pace, summoned a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta.
DICK BEST showed early speed then got pinballed between rivals early, suffered a shuffle between runners early on the turn, exited the bend three wide
and could not rally. ADRIATIC came in and bumped rival early, bumped again prior to the half-mile pole, was closest in pursuit three wide into the turn,
stayed off the rail to the stretch and weakened. ROMEO'S GLORY got bumped by ADRIATIC early, went two wide around the turn and failed to menace.
CANDYBOX came away quickly then dropped back to track the leader, took the turn four wide and tired. MUNNY BALL steadied between rivals early, raced
greenly to the turn, drifted out around the bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
PEQUENA TORMENTA was off slow to begin then rushed up outside the top pair, dueled with SWEET HEIDELBERG into and around the turn, inched
ahead at the quarter pole, shook free into the stretch and drew off. NEVER SWAY tracked off the inside, took the turn four then three wide, tipped outside
rival in upper stretch and ran on to prove second best. DADDY'SFAVORITESON lacked early speed, raced well off the rail early, went four wide into the turn
then angled in and raced along the inside into the stretch and was along for the show. SWEET HEIDELBERG bumped with outside rival early, vied for the
lead inside a pair of rivals then dueled with PEQUENA TORMENTA, lost touch with that rival into the stretch and weakened down the lane. TICKLISH broke
alertly and showed speed between rivals, could not keep up leaving the backstretch, chased the top pair three wide into the turn, lost ground around the
bend and faded. DONA FLAMA bumped with inner rival early, saved ground while dropping back on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
THRUMPS DREAM (IRE) stalked the pace outside a rival, took aim three wide into the lane, bid three deep in upper stretch, took over past the eighth pole
and drew clear. EVER SMART pressed the pace from outside, dueled on the far turn, took over at the quarter pole, vied between in upper stretch, overtaken
midstretch and held the place. DRAMATIZER went three wide around the first turn, sat off the pace, roused nearing the quarter pole, came five wide into the
stretch and closed well. PRINCESS MO broke well and took control early, set the pace under pressure, dueled on the far turn, was overtaken at the quarter
pole and faltered in the final furlong. KUORA (PER) traveled between and pulled early, continued between up the backstretch, entered the stretch three
wide and needed to find more in the final furlong. JIBBER JABBER (IRE) pulled on the first turn then rated in the early going, chased two wide exiting the far
turn and flattened out. GLESGA GAL (IRE) tracked three deep on the turns then came four wide into the drive and failed to rally. HERMAPHRODITE (FR)
stalked along the inside and steadied briefly around the first turn, traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn and could not
rally. VAROMA broke in and bumped rival at the start, raced near the back of the pack in the two path on the first turn, spun four wide into the lane and
made no impact. ZEYARAAT bumped with outside rival then lost her path at the start, moved to the inside trailing the field, swung five wide leaving the far
turn and was not a factor.
