was outfinished for place. CLOCKED IN TYME lacked early speed, showed late interest, finished wide and was no factor. BE A BANDIT raced near the

the final turn and faded. BEAUTIFUL ENDING raced near the rear in the beginning, moved up, faded and was no threat late. JENNIFER'S ARCH pressed
the early pace and dropped back. OUR LITTLE GIRL raced in the middle of the field and retreated to the back.

took the advantage down the stretch, but came back in the rail and drove clear before the wire. EAGLEOVERTHEMOON pressed the pace, made a bid
around the second turn, took command down the lane, but couldn't hold off VIOLET SHADOWS late. CORBIN'S WILD ACES pressed the early pace, came
out around the first turn, raced outside around the final turn and proved no match for the top two. BEANIE dueled for the early lead, forwardly placed
throughout and faded. SMILING ANGEL lacked early speed, brushed around the first turn and raced evenly near the back. CZAR'S BALLERINA stumbled
at the start, bumped rival, drifted out around the first turn, brushed SMILING ANGEL, finished wide and was no threat. SHE'S TAKIN OVER bumped at the
start, lacked early speed and was never close.

Footnotes
BASSETT challenged on the front end, saved ground and drove clear down the stretch. SWEET RACHEL vied for the early lead, forwardly placed
throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of others. DOUBLE PRIORITY pressed the pace, saved ground around the final turn, made a
rail bid and got up for third. BLAZING CHARLIE broke slow, raced in the back, came around the second turn three wide and got caught for third. F J'S GEM
pressed the pace, raced five wide around the first turn and weakened. OPLIN lacked early speed, raced wide around the final turn and was never a factor.
WESTERN STAR void of early speed and was never close. SHOT ON WINDY HILL showed brief speed, racing four wide around the first turn and dropped
back.

and was caught late for second. ALLIGATOR CRAWL was fractious in the gates, raced near the back in the beginning, made a late gain, but was no factor.

pack and put forth an even effort. TIME TO MOVE raced within striking distance and faded. CALICO JOE raced in the middle of the field, came around the
