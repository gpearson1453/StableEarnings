GOTTA ROLL prompted the pace two wide and from between horses, bid entering the lane, led at the furlong grounds, and held while hanging on her left
lead. EXCETERA pressed three wide, chased a bidding GOTTA ROLL through the lane, but did not have enough to reach that foe. MISS TYRO set the
pace inside of a pair of rivals, got headed by a bidding foe at the furlong grounds, and gave way. HEIGHTEN broke a step slowly, trailed around the turn,
and failed to threaten the top trio. TERRIS STRONG HOPE laid off of the pace along the inside, but faded.

Footnotes
BLACK COFFEE BUZZ tracked two wide, shifted five wide in upper stretch, rallied between horses, bid outside of OH NIKI in the final sixteenth, dueled
thereafter, and prevailed at the wire. OH NIKI stalked the leading trio from along the inside, tipped outside of them entering the lane, rallied to bid entering
the final sixteenth while hanging on her left lead, met BLACK COFFEE BUZZ's challenge shortly after, dueled to the wire, but got nailed. STRONG WOMAN
prompted the pace three wide, led entering the lane, shifted inwardly while clinging to a margin through midstretch, but was outkicked by outer rivals a
sixteenth out, then just saved show. DERRY'S HERO raced at the rear four wide around the turn, shifted six wide in upper stretch, but failed to keep pace
with a pair of inner rallying rivals approaching midstretch, then stayed on while hanging on her left lead, and just missed reaching show. SHAWK'S LIL AVA
set the pace inside of a pair of rivals, then weakened approaching the final sixteenth. RIVER BISCUIT was reluctant to load, then veered inwardly at the
start while breaking slowly, and never got involved. SAVE A PENNY vied two wide and between horses, but weakened at the furlong grounds. THE FINAL
TIME WAS HAND-TIMED

Footnotes
SECRET PICASSO stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leader turning for home to bid at the quarter pole, led entering the lane, edged ahead in
upper stretch, and held from an outer chaser through the final furlong while hanging on his left lead. MAMANEEDSNEWSHOES tracked three wide while in
the four to five path around the turn, but was outmoved by an inner foe approaching the quarter pole, chased that foe through the final furlong, but did not
have enough to reach him late. OUTCASHED set the pace while a bit off of the inner rail, but was headed by an outer bidding foe entering the lane, and
yielded. NOMOREMRNICEGUY laid off of the pace two wide and between horses around the turn, shifted to the six path entering the lane, but failed to
threaten while hanging on his left lead. OSCAR CHOICE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. OFF AND BACK hesitated a bit at the start before
breaking a bit inwardly, then raced off of the pace three wide and tired. GRANITO DE ORO pressed the leader from the outside while in the three path, but
weakened between horses at the quarter pole. SILVER STAR OKIE broke slowly and showed little.

Footnotes
CALCULATING KING settled off of the leading group early on, tracked five wide around the turn, ranged up outside of TOTALLY TIGER in upper stretch,
bid for the lead while taking a bump from that one passing the furlong pole, and edged away late. TOTALLY TIGER laid off of the early leaders while shifting
outside of rivals, tracked five wide early on, then three wide around the turn, drifted out to the four path at the five sixteenths pole while vying for contention,
led in upper stretch as CALCULATING KING menaced, bumped that foe at the furlong grounds while meeting his bid, and got outfinished. COMMON
KNOWLEDGE vied along the inside, fought on through upper stretch as outer rivals gained advantages, and yielded at the sixteenth pole. TARUCA stalked
four wide and between horses, then chased through the lane while lacking a bid. REACH THE CIRCLE vied for the lead two wide, but weakened between
horses entering the lane. BAOZUN laid close up two wide and between horses early on, but faded at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
CAGED BEAR settled off of the pace, five wide, circled inner foes turning for home to bid entering the lane, and assumed command in upper stretch. MY
CITY GIRL set the pace, but proved no match for CAGED BEAR in upper stretch, and held place between horses late. CUSTOM MEDINA tracked four to
three wide, but was outkicked by an outer foe entering the lane, kept on thereafter while hanging on his left lead, but missed reaching place. EVENING
STORM broke slowly, tracked the leaders from the inside, bid for place along the rail at the furlong grounds, but was fended off. PUSSYCAT PUSSYCAT
raced in midpack four wide around the turn, and made little impact. SEXY RAGS prompted the pace three to two wide and from between horses, but tired
entering the lane. ARKANSAS INVASION failed to factor. HARLOW'S VISION never got involved. MISS ALLIE GRACE laid close up two wide early on, but
steadily faded into and around the turn.
