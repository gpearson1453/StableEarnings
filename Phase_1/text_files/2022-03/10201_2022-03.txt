Footnotes
JESSE THE GREAT was rated along early and made a four wide move on the turn to move into contention by the quarter pole, then dueled for command by
the furlong marker and edged away to prove best under a drive. JUSTKISSMYGRITS set the pace from the inside and was headed nearing the furlong
marker and proved to be no match for the winner late, second best. TRIPP ROAD chased the pace on the inside, eased out on the turn and came four wide
into the lane, lacked the needed stretch bid while besting the rest. KATY THE CAT stalked the early pace three wide and was two wide by the quarter pole
and weakened. PROMISE OF JOY chased the early pace in between horses and weakened.

DISCREET SISTER was well rated early, made a three wide move on the turn to draw clear leaving the turn, then held sway late to prove best under a
drive. MAD FOR FAME was reserved early on the inside, eased out mid way on the far turn and came four wide into the lane while advancing, closed well
under strong left handed crop urging but could not get to the winner, clearly second best. PARANOIA set the pace on the inside and was headed on the far
turn, weakened and stayed on to best the rest. ROYALBONNIELEGACY was reserved early three wide and lacked a rally, failed to menace. SHE'S
DANCING prompted the pace three wide and tired.
