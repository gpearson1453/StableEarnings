Footnotes
DESERTROSE OFTEXAS set the pace in the clear shifting in to the two path, maintained the advantage through the turn, was challenged in the stretch
while drifting out but held at bay that rival under steady handling. IMPEACHING switched out tracking the leader two then three wide on the turn, was
carried out a bit in the stretch but could make no headway while clearly second best. RUN LIKE KATE stalked three to four wide, failed to rally. RAISE OUR
FLAG failed to threaten after going two wide through the turn. ZENMAGIC chased inside and was not a factor.

FEEL THIS MOMENT set the pace in the clear, went in the two to three path through the turn, drifted out in the stretch but held safe. MS HIGHSPEED
angled out heading up the backstretch content to trail, went three then five wide on the turn, was gaining but too late. SHADOW JUMPER chased three to
four wide, ran on evenly in the stretch. HOLLYWOOD BOUND was a step slow at the break spotting the field just over a length, moved forward up the
backstretch in pursuit from outside, went four to five wide on the turn, made no late bid. OUR ISLAND GIRL failed to rally after saving ground. TRIMBLE
DAT chased two to three wide, dropped back on the turn, was not able to threaten.
