Footnotes
PEAK OF CHIC trailed early, circled her field into the stretch and surged clear in the final stages. MS CANELA slipped through inside to the front into the
stretch then bore out crowding rival through the lane. DILLY DILLY PHILLY forced the pace in the two path, was carried out through the stretch but
continued well. FLASHING DIAMOND prompted the pace four wide, remained wide on the turn and finished willingly. BACK CHANNEL prompted the pace
three wide to the stretch and proved empty. ALWAYS TALKING quickly sprinted to the front inside, dueled through the turn then faded late. Following a
stewards inquiry and an objection by the third finisher against the second finisher for interference in the stretch, MS. CANELLA was disqualified and placed
third.

DIVINE MIRACLE dueled inside, repelled that rival into the stretch, was challenged again, came out brushing that rival in the lane and held on gamely to the
finish. ROAN MOUNTAIN settled off the leaders, bid wide to the front in the stretch, was brushed from the inside and outfinished. DOUBLE THE HEART
alternated for the lead outside then weakened in the stretch. COLONEL JUAN saved ground off the pace then began fading on the final turn. BUMPERDOO
raced close up between rivals then stopped after half a mile. A claim of foul by the runner-up against the winner for interference in the stretch was
dismissed.

MISS LOYALTY saved ground throughout, rallied into the stretch and wore down the leader in the final furlong. MISS DILLINGHAM stalked the leaders
outside, took over on the final turn but weakened late. TIZ A SHARPIE lacked speed, moved extremely wide and closed well. FED POLICY trailed early then
offered some late energy while wide. JADE DELTA moved closer in the two path after half a mile and flattened out. ASSUME CONTROL bid outside on the
final turn then proved empty in the stretch. FLEETERTHAN alternated for the lead inside then faded in the stretch. MALIBU ANTHEM dropped well behind
while wide and was never a factor. HAY BUCK earned a narrow advantage off the rail for half a mile then stopped.

EXIT RIGHT set a measured pace inside, widened throughout, remained well clear and was geared down late. SECRET PATH made a menacing wide bid
on the final turn but proved no match for the winner. JACOHARE reserved close up, continued willingly while unable to gain. SILVER EDGE inside early,
advanced wide on the final turn then flattened out. LONG GRAY LINE dropped back inside, angled wide after half a mile and was no factor. THEY SHOT
SONNY lacked speed and was never in contention. BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL lagged far behind throughout. MARCO ISLAND pressed the winner outside for
half a mile and stopped abruptly.

BRAZEN vied wide down the backstretch, dueled two wide on the turn then drew away in the stretch while kept to his task. MACH TRIAL dropped back
early, moved outside on the turn then back inside passing rivals in the stretch. SNEAKINESS was urged close up between rivals then inside and continued
well in the stretch. JAMMINWITHBRANDON lagged far behind then passed rivals without threatening. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN dueled with the winner inside
to the quarter pole and gave way. PORTAL ONE dropped back early outside and was never a factor. FEDERAL CASE prompted the pace to the turn then
began faltering.

Footnotes
MAMAIGOTTHIS angled inside into the far turn, bid to the front in the stretch and lasted. LOAD UP MOE far back early, advanced inside and narrowed the
gap late. MR THRIFTY saved ground, bid on the final turn then flattened out. TAINO hustled to the front inside to the stretch and weakened. WEEKEND IN
COURT advanced inside before half a mile then flattened out in the stretch. PIGGYBANK broke slowly then rallied past fading rivals. NIMBLE BEAST forced
the pace for three quarters and weakened. POLITICAL dropped back early and lacked a rally. DEFIBRILLATOR urged within range for half a mile and gave
way. YONDERING dropped back early and far back throughout. SAMARONTI stopped abruptly losing contact with his field.
