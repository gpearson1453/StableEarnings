HARD TEN tipped out early stalking just off the pacesetter on the backstretch, pressed that foe racing into the turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch
while gaining a clear advantage, then maintained that margin to the end under firm right handed encouragement. VALID EXCHANGE tracked off the first
flight near the inside in the opening stages, was urged to advance between foes racing into the turn, shifted out gaining position four wide between foes
entering the stretch and edged a rival for the place honors late. SUPER EDGAR was settled last in early stages while racing well off the inside, was
prompted to advance four wide, then five wide through the turn to upper stretch, then continued in pursuit of the winner while outkicked for second. TITHED
stalked just off the pacesetter along the inside on the backstretch, dropped back racing into the bend and lacked a closing response. NICE OF ME tracked
off the first flight outside a rival in early stages, was prompted to gain contention three wide racing into the bend but emptied out nearing upper stretch. KING
ANDRES was urged to the lead near the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin a bit off the rail in the opening quarter, dueled for command inside the

MELANCHOLY BLUES tracked the leaders inside a rival from just out of striking distance racing through the backstretch, tipped out leaving the midway
point of the turn to race three wide into upper stretch advancing on the pacesetter, took over from that foe in late stages and went clear under some right
handed pressure. JARA broke readily, pressed the pace outside a rival through the backstretch, went clear midway through the turn, held sway past
midstretch but failed to sustain her momentum while prevailing for the place honors. SO MOXIE tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second
flight racing to the turn, then continued a bit off the inside into the stretch to gain some position between foes while prevailing for a share.
TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE was urged along the inside disputing the pace through the backstretch, couldn't match terms with JARA entering the turn and
faded into the stretch. LA ALHAMBRA tracked off the second flight racing three wide, then four wide into the turn and steadily faded into the stretch.
KISSMELIPS stumbled badly at the start losing position to the field, was settled into stride while angling to the inside early and trailed throughout.

KILLEEN broke readily, was urged disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing off the rail through the backstretch, edged clear racing into the turn,
then responded when roused racing into upper stretch to draw well clear of the field in the closing stages. LAUDERDALE tracked off the first flight between
foes on the backstretch, was prompted to advance while tipping out three wide racing into upper stretch, couldn't gain terms with the winner but continued
with interest to hold a rival for the place honors. CANDY MY BOY tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight three wide on the backstretch, came
under pressure to advance while angling to the inside racing into upper stretch but was outkicked for second. MITZRAYIM, urged along the inside pursuing
the leaders on the backstretch, dropped out early. CROI MOR was urged prompting the eventual winner in the three path through the backstretch into the

URBAN WARRIOR broke sharply, sprinted to lead on a clear margin through the backstretch, tipped out nearing upper stretch and held sway on a widening
advantage while being kept to firm encouragement. UNCLEJACKOMO tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing in the three path to the
turn, shifted inwards continuing with a steady effort into the stretch and held a rival for the place honors. NANTUCKETER ducked out at the start, was
settled off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out three wide entering upper stretch and continued with interest while being just
outkicked for second. CPOWER tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in the second flight racing into the turn, then faded into upper stretch. UNIQUE PATH
raced four wide between foes while dropping out of close quarters behind the second flight after the opening quarter and offered no rally. HOLIDAY
DANCER was outpaced early. SPANISH SOUL, caught five wide in the opening stages, was prompted to terms with the second flight four wide on the
backstretch and gave way in that path nearing the stretch.

Footnotes
BENEVENGO vied for command three deep between foes through the backstretch, shifted inwards to gain a narrow advantage just off the inside racing into
upper stretch, then held the challenge of CYBERVIKING to the end under firm right handed pressure. The latter was urged between foes prompting the
pace inside the leaders on the backstretch, angled to the rail racing into upper stretch and continued willingly inside the winner to contest the issue to the
end. TRIPULANTE, in touch with the pacesetter four wide prompting that rival in early, continued to press the issue three wide through the turn to upper
stretch and weakened late. SHED A TEAR broke readily, tracked just off the first flight outside rivals racing five wide early, then four wide into the stretch but
had no closing bid. KABOD tracked the leaders along the inside racing to the turn but lacked the needed closing response. PRETTY DUDE broke slowly
and trailed throughout.

MON PARADIS was urged prompting the pace outside a rival from the outset to the far turn, took over racing into upper stretch, forged clear under pressure
and was taken in hand once the issue was decided. SHES SKY HIGH, carried out a bit at the start, tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing in the
three path to the backstretch, then continued with a steady effort in that path racing into the stretch to prove best of the others. MERICATHEBEAUTIFUL
angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, tipped outside a tiring foe racing into upper stretch and continued well enough to
earn a share. VARSITY KICKLINE (IRE) ducked out at the start, was settled last racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch but
had no rally. DREAM TRACER angled to the inside in early stages tracking off the second flight but offered no rally. LA LENA broke sharply, was urged
along the inside setting the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, dueled for command inside the winner on the second bend and gave way into
upper stretch.

Footnotes
ISLE OF SKYE, forwardly placed three wide stalking a rival's pace on the backstretch, took over from that foe midway through the turn, went clear while
angling inwards racing into the stretch and kicked away under some right handed pressure. SWIFT DANCER tracked the leaders three wide between foes
in the opening stages, switched out four wide entering the turn while being prompted to advance, then continued with a steady effort in that path to prove
best of the others. HEAVY WEIGHT settled outside foes dropping off the second flight on the backstretch, raced five wide into the turn, continued in that
path to late stages but finished with interest to improve position while earning a share. EL FANTASMA ducked out at the start, tracked off the first flight
between foes racing to the turn but offered no rally. RUNAWAY TOM angled to the inside in early while making brief pursuit of the leaders along the rail
racing into the turn, then gave way into upper stretch. AS DE ORO COCO flashed brief pace four wide in the opening furlong but gave way early.
WILLWORKFORFOOD switched off the inside early setting the pace on a narrow advantage racing through the backstretch but gave way abruptly between
foes racing into the turn. QUALITY TRIP broke slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SHE FLED THE SCENE broke slowly losing position to the field, pulled her way to contention three wide in the opening half mile, shifted inwards to attend
the pace outside a rival racing to the third turn, moved to gain a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch and held TAKE TO THE SKIES to the end under
pressure. The latter was rated stalking just off the pacesetter in the opening half mile, continued outside a rival tracking the leaders as part of the second
flight racing to the third bend, was prompted to advance while being fanned three wide racing past midstretch and was just outkicked. LADY DOMINANCE
was rated between foes in early stages, angled to the rail after the opening half mile to track the pacesetter inside a rival as part of the second flight, came
around a tiring foe leaving the third bend to bid inside the leaders leaving midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair. TOWERING GAZE settled last in the
opening stages, continued unhurried for a mile, swung out four wide leaving the third bend and continued evenly in the closing stages. GO YEOWOMEN
went to the lead while angling inside in early stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the third bend and gave way racing into the stretch. SECRET
TEMPLE was rated off the second flight along the inside in the opening mile and faded racing into the third bend. DOUBLE DOT was settled outside foes in
the opening stages and dropped out of contention early.

INITFORTHELOVE, reserved outside foes in the opening mile, continued under patient handling into the third bend, was prompted to advance five wide with
five sixteenths of a mile to go, moved to challenge the pacesetter in the four path racing into upper stretch and wrested a clear advantage in time under firm
left handed encouragement. MOTATAABEQ, reserved outside a rival in the last flight in the opening mile, made a sharp advance to challenge for command
racing four wide into the third bend, gained the advantage racing into upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid but proved only second best. ISAIAS DREAM,
forwardly placed along the inside in the opening half, tracked the pacesetter as part of the second flight through the second bend, advanced along the rail to
strike the front racing into the third bend, kept on inside foes racing into the stretch disputing second to late stages but weakened nearing the wire, then was
vanned off the course. JIMMY D angled to the inside tracking behind rivals in the second flight racing to the third turn, tipped off the inside racing into upper
stretch but had no closing bid. BIRD'S EYE VIEW was rated between foes, then angled to the inside after six furlongs, saved ground on the third turn to
upper stretch but had no rally. MARV'S MAGIC settled along the inside as part of the last flight in the opening pace, switched outside foes on the third bend,
was fanned five wide into upper stretch but passed only tiring rivals. EL PILLO switched off the inside in the opening half mile to track off the second flight
between foes to the third bend and steadily faded into the stretch. ROAD TO MEATH tracked off the second flight three wide in the opening mile and
emptied out racing into the third turn. JACK RABBIT QUICK switched out early tracking the leader outside a rival as part of the second flight for six furlongs,
lodged a brief, three wide nearing the third turn but soon gave out. HOLD THE SPICE, caught five wide racing into the first turn, was prompted to gain the
lead outside foes after the opening three furlongs, was urged well clear for six furlongs, then gave out abruptly between foes racing into the third turn.
