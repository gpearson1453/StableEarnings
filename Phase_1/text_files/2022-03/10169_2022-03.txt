Footnotes
MISS RITA close from the start, moved closer three wide late in the turn, dueled in the two path entering the stretch, shook clear a furlong out, enough left to
hold off the runner up at the wire. CHOCTAW CHARLIE raced in mid pack while off the inside, followed the winner in the two path into the lane, shifted out
when straightened for home, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late. LORI'S EYES forwardly placed along the inside, asked along late in the turn,
steered out turning for home, slow gain. TWENTYTWENTYREDO fell back after the start, saved ground through the turn, improved position through the
traffic with some belated interest. CATCH A WHIFF broke on top, set the pace toward the inside, gave way when headed. ON A SHOESTRING lacked early
foot outside, continued to race three wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. ALLELUIA ANGEL broke back, improved position the middle quarter,
failed to sustain that improvement through the stretch. STREET RIDE within striking outside, four wide through the turn, backed up through the stretch.
SOBER SUNDAY broke back, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
ADMIRABLY outrun in the early going, saved ground into the turn, advanced along the rail through the turn, rail bid past the furlong marker, quickly kicked
clear. STURGILL set the pace up the backstretch off the inside, larger lead in the turn, offered little resistance to the winner when allowing that one the
inside past the furlong marker, remained clear for the runner up spot. WIN WITH PRIDE settled off the pace and the inside, raced four wide through the turn,
along for the show with some mild late interest. LICHITA chased the runner up while racing off the inside, three wide into the lane, had little left for the run to
the wire, outkicked for the show late. STORM ADVISORY fell back, one paced through the lane. AWESOME SATURDAY broke back, saved ground to no
avail. HONORARY DEGREE was always outrun.

Footnotes
NORTHERN WOODS never far back while outside up the backstretch, moved to challenge and dueled into the lane in the two path, disposed of the other
speed past the furlong marker, clear, lasted late. LOCHMOOR off a step slow to race well back early off the inside, moved toward the inside late turn, back
out when straightened for home, roused, late burst to be rapidly getting to the winner in the waning strides. MAMMOTH SPRING broke alertly, soon cleared
inner rivals, showed the way into the turn, dueled out of the bend inside the winner then began to gradually weakened, comfortably saved the show.
BRASKA bumped at the break, raced well back early just off the inside, improved position through the lane. PERIPATETIC void of early foot, angled out to
be four wide when advancing into the lane, improved through upper stretch then flattened out a bit the final furlong. VISION OF ELIAS broke in to bump
BRASKA, was straightened to race in the second flight inside, continued to save ground turn, came up empty when set down the final furlong. RIANTE SKY
broke a step slow, moved outside when well back, raced four to five wide turn, improved a bit stretch by passing tiring rivals. MY KINDA TETON void of
speed, in the two path through the turn, also passed mostly tiring rivals in the drive. OBVIOUSLY TOO unruly loading into the gate, broke with the field,
raced in the main body while racing outside, four wide through the turn, tired through the stretch. UCANTMAKETHISTUFUP away in good order, raced in
the second flight and in traffic up the backstretch, backed up through the lane. YOUNG O' DAINE raced briefly forward while between horsed early, began a
steady retreat before a half. ROYAL DE BE in mid pack along the inside, also steadily backed up before four furlongs.

Footnotes
EASTSIDE COOL in the second flight inside, crept closer into the far turn, challenged along the rail turning for home, gained command, lugged out badly
past the furlong floating PALACE COUP outward, was straightened then lugged out again when struck with a lefthanded crop late to bother that same rival
with a sixteenth remaining causing that one to check up then drew clear of that same foe late. PALACE COUP settled off the pace while saving ground for
five furlongs, steered out three wide turning for home, chased the winner past midstretch, checked up with that one lugged out late, fell back but remained
clear for the place. PATS PROPERTY dueled up front closest to but not on the outside, edged away from the other speed late in the final turn, allowed
EASTSIDE COOL the inside entering the stretch, lost the advantage to that one, could keep pace with the runner up the final furlong, saved the show.
BEER CHASER lacked early foot outside, continued out in the strip into the far turn, four wide turning into the stretch, displayed some mild late interest to be
gaining for the show late. MYOPIC off a step slow, trailed well back early, angled out three wide turning for home, improved position a bit without posing a
serious threat. C FALLS broke on top, dueled up front in the three path through the first turn, continued to alternate up front in the run up the backstretch,
first to blink final turn. MAJESTIC WEST settled in mid pack and just off the inside, continued one paced through the second turn and had nothing for the
stretch run. LAMUTANAATTY four wide into the first turn, steered in a bit to save some ground, was finished after five furlongs. STAYIN' OUT LATE with
always outrun. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF
PALACE COUP AGAINST EASTSIDE COOL FOR INTERFERENCE LATE, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
PRESS SNOOZE back off the pace, steered out to be five wide out of the turn, rallied down the middle of the strip, bid a furlong out, drove clear under
steady handling. FUTILE last away, raced back toward the inside, lost whip in the turn, roused into lane, finished willingly while inside of several rivals.
PETIT VERDOT in mid pack while off the inside, moved closer in some traffic late in the turn, came four wide and between foes into the stretch, bid,
flattened out in the late going. MR. ANKENY broke sharp, set the early pace, headed just before a quarter, dueled into and through the turn, regained the
advantage entering the stretch, weakened late. SKYSCANNER lacked speed off the inside, steered out to be four wide through most of the turn, moved out
further past the furlong, improved position slightly while not a serious threat. TAPPIN FORA DANCE within striking distance up the backstretch while four
wide, moved a bit closer in the four path late in the turn, faltered in the final eighth. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER void of speed, angled out to be four wide by late
in the turn, made little impact in the run to the wire. JACK VAN BERG moved up after the start to duel before a quarter, narrowly showed the way into the
turn, gave way when the real running began exiting the bend. SEAU broke in good order, forwardly placed three wide and between foes early, began a
steady retreat in the turn.

of the strip to prove clearly best. TULANE TRYST broke with the field, raced back and outside, four wide through the turn while also in no hurry, shifted just
off a rivals heels in upper stretch while inside the winner through the lane when rallying, could not keep up the final sixteenth, clear of the others. GREELEY
AND BEN raced up along the inside, continued to vie through the turn, dueled past the furlong marker, could not contain the top two late, proved determined
to hold the show late. HOLLIS moved up to narrowly show the way into the turn, continued to hold a small advantage through the bend off the inside, dueled
past the furlong marker, weakened, lost last position late while also unable to hang with the top two. NO SHIRT NO SHOES broke well, fell back off the
pace and the inside, behind horses into the lane, improved position without proving to be a serious threat. HEART RHYTHM behind the first flight well wide,
four wide into the turn, moved a bit closer in some traffic late in the bend, flattened out through the stretch. ROYAL DAAHER forwardly placed three wide,
moved closer in some tight quarters into the turn, tired in the drive. ATOKA broke near the back, off the inside, moved closer three to four wide by late in the
turn, gave way in the drive. KNEEDEEPINSNOW with the leaders in the run up the backstretch, in tight, then steadied in traffic early in the turn, dropped
inside, gave way late.

Footnotes
RATED R SUPERSTAR allowed the pace to go, accelerated into contention while steering out four wide turning for home, gained command inside the
furlong marker, kicked clear late to finish with good energy. PLAINSMAN with the pace from the start, dueled up front in the two path, continued to battle into
the lane, gave ground grudgingly in the late going while hanging on gamely for the place. BEAU LUMINARIE void of speed in trailing, moved out for the
drive, rallied out in the strip, not enough late for the second spot. THOMAS SHELBY last to leave, quickly recovered to move up and duel inside the runner
up, held a narrow advantage through the second turn and in upper stretch, succumbed late in an honest effort. WARRIOR'S CHARGE forward while off the
inside, moved closer in the three pace second turn, failed to sustain that effort through the lane. POPULAR KID settled off the pace, had little for the drive.
HANALEI'S HOUDINI one paced off the inside, tired in the drive.

Footnotes
LET'S CRUISE took control just after the start, two path first turn, continued to show the way the middle half, rebroke through the stretch to draw well clear.
A REAL JEWEL closest to the leader to that one's outside, moved closer in the second turn to lodge a mild bid through the second turn between horses,
could not keep up in the drive, all out to preserve the runner up spot late. SUNNY ISLE BEACH lacked speed, saved ground through the final turn, made a
mild bid for the place late, outkicked for that position while clear of the others. URSULINA raced in mid pack and outside, moved closer outside the runner
up to briefly challenge in the second turn, weakened in the drive. DUPLICITOUS settled off the pace toward the inside, lacked a response in the drive to
finish up evenly. GUANA CAY off a step slow, four wide through the first turn, moved a bit closer while remaining in the four path second turn, flattened out
in the drive. TROUVILLE raced back throughout to never menace. SUNDIAL prompted the issue for a half, stopped.
