WORD ON A WING led narrowly early outside of GRAB THE GOLD, edged clear near the half, opened up further under a mild hand ride in the two path
around the far turn, and cleared further in the lane under a mild drive. MEET ME AT MUNDIS raced at the rear of a compact pack early, checked back near
the five furlong mark when NEWSTOME came in on him. trailed down the rest of the backstretch and into the turn, raced in the three path on the turn,
swung out into the six path in upper stretch for rally, kept on under a drive and caught NEWSTONE for place honors. NEWSTOME raced near the rear
early, came in on MEET ME AT MUNDIS near the five furlong mark when advancing to join the tracking flight, tracked the leading pair inside of BEYOND
THE BEND, checked between horses approaching the half, kept on to chase the leader while saving ground after GRAB THE GOLD began to fade, chased
on inside down the lane while no match for the winner and was caught late for the place. BEYOND THE BEND tracked the leading pair outside of
NEWSTOME early, continued three deep when GRAB THE GOLD joined the inside of their flight near the half, chased the leading pair two wide on the turn,
and weakened in the lane. GRAB THE GOLD prompted the early pace inside of WORD ON A WING, settled back to the inside of the tracking flight
approaching the half, began to fade from past the seven sixteenths in the two path on the turn, and was allowed to trail home.

Footnotes
FIRST FOREVER was off last but advanced to the lead inside foes approaching the five eighths, raced clear while saving ground around the turn, faced a
bid from S W BRIAR ROSE near the quarter, turned that foe back when driven near the three sixteenths, and kept on to hold sway down the lane. S W
BRIAR ROSE broke well, settled to track the pace between horses, was urged two wide on the turn, began to gain on the leader near the three eighths,
loomed near the quarter, was turned back into the lane, continued to chase the pacesetter while drifting out and held the place. TANYA'S GEM tracked the
early pace three wide, continued to track the leading pair around the turn while positioned three wide, swung into the lane in the five path, chased under a
drive and ultimately lacked the needed kick to reel in the top pair. SWEET TURN raced at the inside of the tracking flight, dropped back inside past the half
mile mark, saved ground around the turn, was driven inside down the lane, made mild improvement midstretch but ultimately proved no threat.

SLEEPY N JOYFUL tracked between horses through the clubhouse turn, prompted outside of BEST CAUSE into the backstretch, settled back to stalk just
off her approaching the turn, engaged her for good past the seven sixteenths, gained even terms two wide near the quarter, continued to give chase when
BEST CAUSE kicked away in upper stretch, regained even terms midstretch, dueled outside her and prevailed. BEST CAUSE was away sharply, set the
pace through the clubhouse turn, maintained a narrow lead down the back straight as SLEEPY N JOYFUL outside and ABOVE THE LINE inside
intermittently prompted her, was engaged in earnest by SLEEPY N JOYFUL past the seven sixteenths, met even terms with her near the quarter, briefly
kicked away again in upper stretch, but dueled inside of SLEEPY N JOYFUL through the final furlong and was narrowly outfinished by that foe. FAVORITE
DOLL chased midfield inside of SEEKING THE THRONE early, continued at the back of a compact main group down the back straight, edged up to take
closer order inside from near the half, chased inside around the far turn, angled out approaching the quarter, swung into the turn five wide, responded with a
rally, but could not get to the leading pair late. HONESTA settled at the rear, raced inside of EMPRESS NEFERTITI around the clubhouse turn and into the
backstretch, took closer order on the main group into the lane, swung out, and kept on mildly to gain a minor award late. SEEKING THE THRONE chased
two wide through the clubhouse turn, continued midfield between horses down the backstretch, offered a mild two wide bid near the seven sixteenths, could
not get within close range of the leading pair, chased on under a drive in the lane while no match for the top three, and lost fourth late. ABOVE THE LINE
tracked the leader inside through the clubhouse turn, continued to track the leading pair down the back straight, chased that pair while saving ground
through the clubhouse turn, had no bid into the lane and weakened inside. SWITCHRATTLENROLL tracked three wide through the first turn, settled back to
chase four wide down the backstretch, was driven in the five to six path around the far turn and lacked a rally in the eight path in the lane. EMPRESS
NEFERTITI raced two wide in the rear pair around the first turn, was urged through the clubhouse turn to keep up, lost ground steadily from the half, had no
further response when driven into the lane and was not persevered with late.

UNION RALLY pressed the pace outside of SILVER LOCKS, drew even near the five sixteenths, dueled outside her to midstretch, took the lead when
driven midstretch while racing in the four to five path, drifted out late but nonetheless edged away. SILVER LOCKS took a narrow lead inside early, set the
pace while attended by UNION RALLY to her outside down the backstretch and into the turn, was joined by that foe near the five sixteenths, went to a drive
in upper stretch, continued to vie to midstretch, but could not hold UNION RALLY at bay in the final furlong. SWEET MESA was unprepared at the start and
trailed, took mildly closer order on the leading pair around the far turn, chased the leading pair down the lane but ultimately never threatened.

Footnotes
LOST IN NEWYORK tracked the early pace three wide, stalked the leader in the three path on the turn, engaged outside of him near the three eighths, took
the lead into the lane, drove clear and held despite drifting out. NICE WEATHER soon led inside, continued clear in the two path into the turn, was engaged
by LOST IN NEWYORK past the three eighths and headed by that foe into the lane, proved no match from the three sixteenths, switched out midstretch,
chased on and held the place. BOURBON MUSIC tracked the pace between horses early, chased the leading pair in the four path on the turn while racing
outside of NIMITZ CLASS, proved no match for the top two into the lane, drifted out, but churned on well enough to wrest the show from NIMITZ CLASS
late. NIMITZ CLASS was bumped in the opening strides by TALENTED T J but was nonetheless prominent in the opening strides, settled back to chase at
the inside of the main group, chased the leading pair in the three path on the far turn while racing inside of BOURBON MUSIC, went to a drive in upper
stretch, offered a brief bid midstretch but could not hold off BOURBON MUSIC coming back for the show. TALENTED T J hopped at the start, broke inward,
bumped NIMITZ CLASS, and soon trailed, continued well behind the field in the three path on the turn and lacked the needed rally in the lane. DUE TO A
TIMER MALFUNCTION THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
GREY QUEST soon cleared to the lead, set the pace in the two to three path on the turn, kept on a clear lead into the lane, was driven to maintain an
advantage, saw that lead dwindle in the final sixteenth but found enough to hold. DEB'S GUNFIGHTER settled at the rear of the main group outside of MY
MAN GEORGIO, chased three wide on the turn, began to improve past the five sixteenths, went to a drive near the quarter, sustained his rally in the lane,
gained well to the finish but did not catch the leader in time. ARTIE CHILLER tracked the leader early outside of MR DUBAI, continued to track the
pacesetter in the three to four path on the turn, did not quicken with the leader into the lane, went to a drive approaching the three sixteenths, kept on
willingly down the lane, began to close up ground on the leader well in the final sixteenth, did not get to him in time and was nailed for place in the last
strides. PAULINO was bumped between horses in the opening strides and soon trailed, continued to trail in the two path on the turn, swung to the six path in
upper stretch, and passed tiring horses. MY MAN GEORGIO was bumped by PAULINO in the opening strides after that one was bumped by MR DUBAI,
chased behind the tracking flight early, made mild improvement between horses past the three eighths, went to a drive at the head of the stretch, but
flattened out from midstretch. MR DUBAI broke outward and bumped PAULINO in the opening strides, tracked the pace inside of ARTIE CHILLER early,
began to lose ground inside horses past the half, was outpaced into the lane and allowed to trail home.

MOVIE SCORE tracked the leading pair while positioned three wide early, improved approaching the half mile mark, stalked in the three path on the turn,
rallied to the lead near the quarter, cleared in upper stretch, kept on under a drive and narrowly held. QUEEN ROSEMARY settled in the rear pair inside of
AMI'S LINK, was urged for a bid between horses near the three eighths, began to improve, swung three wide into upper stretch, sustained her rally under a
drive, gained well outside of MOVIE SCORE in the final sixteenth and just missed. TOMARIE tracked just outside the pacesetter, bid from near the half,
headed the pacesetter approaching the three eighths, led in the two path from there until headed by MOVIE SCORE near the quarter, chased on while no
match for that foe into upper stretch, and flattened. AMI'S LINK settled outside of QUEEN ROSEMARY in the rear pair, continued three wide in the rear pair
on the far turn while urged for a bid, took mildly closer order, was all out by the three sixteenths, and flattened out in the final furlong. COLOR FORCE set
the pace inside, was headed by TOMARIE approaching the three eighths, folded readily, and had nothing further to give when driven in the lane.

WOW FACTOR was bumped when DANCE A LITTLE JIG came inward in the opening strides, nonetheless had a narrow early lead, pressed the pace
outside of GLOSSY MADRINA past the five eighths and into the turn, took the lead from her near the three eighths and soon cleared, and continued clear
under a drive in the lane. DANCE A LITTLE JIG came in and bumped WOW FACTOR in the opening strides, tracked four and then three wide down the
back straight, was pushed on for a bid past the three eighths, raced three wide into upper stretch, kept on with interest under a drive between horses, could
not run down the leader but got the bob for place. LEFTATTHEALTAR settled in second last early, began to improve outside of KAZ'S PRINCESS and
MISS PARFAIT approaching the five sixteenths, turned four wide into the lane, continued to rally down the lane, kept on willingly to the wire but lost the
place nod. KAZ'S PRINCESS was bumped by WOW FACTOR in the opening strides due to DANCE A LITTLE JIG breaking inward, chased two wide early,
raced between horses while tracking the leading pair into the turn, was driven between horses past the three eighths but did not gain on the leader, swung
three wide into the lane and was all out to pass tiring horses. GLOSSY MADRINA was forward from the outset, advanced to take the lead past the five
eighths, set the pace while prompted by WOW FACTOR, was headed by that foe for good near the three eighths, began to lose ground around the rest of
the turn, and kept flattening between horses in the lane. MISS PARFAIT settled toward the rear of the main group early, inched forward near the half to join
the inside of the tracking flight, was urged inside around the turn but did not gain on the leading pair, chased inside in upper stretch and weakened. MUNNY
CALL settled well behind the rest of the field, trailed in the four path on the turn and offered no bid.
