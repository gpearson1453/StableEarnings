Footnotes
ITS MY MONEY TOO angled in on the first turn to set the pace while two wide, was in a long drive and kept to task for the win. IMA SKY TRAVELER
chased the pace while three wide, made bid on the far turn then angled in mid-stretch to close willingly in the end. DIXIE CARROUSEL veered in at the start
then chased the pace along the rail, rallied on the far turn to close well in the stretch drive. COSMETOLOGY chase the pace while four wide, continued to
menace on the far turn to close willingly in the stretch. MRS. KRINKLES pressed the leader from the inside, was in a hard drive, but tired in late stretch.
AIRLINE DRIVE settled two wide on the backstretch, made a bid in the far turn but was no threat. FABULOUS INDY was unhurried early and no factor.
AWESOME SUNSET was unhurried early and no menace.
