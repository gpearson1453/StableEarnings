Footnotes
MISS IMPORTANT was steadied at the start to be away slowly, moved up outside, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, closed steadily and wore down
her rivals to be up late. SECOND GRACE was never far off the pace, raced outside, bid six wide to challenge, dueled through for the lead, led late and was
outfinished in a good effort. CHEROKEE PAPOOSE raced close to the pace, bid willingly, didn't have enough late and settled for show. JUDICIAL set a
pressured pace, inched away on the turn, responded to duel and stopped near the sixteenth pole. TICK TOCK saved ground to the turn, shifted out for the
drive and lacked the needed rally. SONGOFTHEDESERT pressed the pace along the inside to the turn and stopped.

the pace, raced outside, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and had little left for the drive. KANDI SPUN stalked the pace, bid off the rail, had nothing
left and dropped back. LOVE YA MOST was through after a half and faded. WINTER STAR trailed the field and was not urged.

ALL AMERICAN HERO stalked the pace, rallied three across on the turn, assumed command and drew off. UNION BROTHER bumped and was squeezed
at the start, raced in the back, went seven wide at the top of the stretch , closed willingly and was gaining fast late. THIRSTY JUNIOR came in at the start,
stalked the pace and lacked the needed late response. GEORGIAN ROAD was never far back, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, closed well and
failed to menace. MO GEE failed to threaten in an even effort. SIX NINETY ONE was hustled along to set the pace to the turn, was used up and dropped
back. FLOWER BEACH bumped at the start, raced inside and had brief speed only. BLUE BOY WHO broke awkwardly to be away slowly, raced in the back
and lacked a response.

Footnotes
GENERAL THAYER bumped at the start, dueled to the turn, drew off for a clear lead under left handed urging and held safely. DAREABIGDREAM was
slow early, raced outside, dropped in, closed steadily and was gaining late. MR LOVE MUFFIN bumped at the start, was never far back, went seven wide
entering the stretch and offered a mild bid to be along for show. HASTA LA VISTA improved position in an even effort. LUVTHEONEURWITH trailed the
field, bid along the rail on the turn, had nothing left and lacked a response. STORMY SUMMIT dueled to the turn, tired and gave way. FROG WALKER was
hustled along to show speed to the turn, swung wide and gave way. CHICKEN N BISCUIT showed brief speed while racing along the rail and steadily faded
from contention.

Footnotes
OFF THE BOOKS advanced to the turn, bid seven wide and wore down his rivals to get up near the wire. CHARMING VINTAGE stalked the pace, assumed
command into the turn, drew off for a clear lead and was caught. NORTH FORK lagged early, put in a steady effort and got up at the wire for show. GIVE A
LITTLE sprinted clear to set the pace, fell back into the turn, went evenly late and caught for third. HIGH FLYIN TIGER was never far back, lacked a bid and
failed to menace. KEEN JAMES broke awkwardly and failed to threaten in an even effort. RISE UP MOSCOW was not a factor. SHAKELAS DESTINY
raced inside, was through after a half, stopped and was not urged through the stretch. LUCKY CHANCE was through early.

Footnotes
MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) raced close to the pace, awaited room on the turn, slipped through along the rail, dueled for the lead, came out late and
proved best. COLAVITO set the pace, responded when challenged to duel, was crowded late and outfinished in a game effort. FISHEL was slow early,
advanced to the turn, was blocked in the upper stretch, altered course and closed well to earn show. I WILL YEAH (IRE) challenged four across on the turn,
went eight wide at the top of the stretch and leveled off in the drive. CRYPTO GOLD was void of early speed, went nine wide at the top of the stretch and
finished well. WILLTOBELUCKY raced mid pack in an even effort and failed to menace. JAKE THE GREAT stalked the pace, challenged between horses
on the turn and flattened out. CIBERTRUCK stalked the pace, challenged between horses on the turn and gave way. WARRIORS HERO was outrun.
