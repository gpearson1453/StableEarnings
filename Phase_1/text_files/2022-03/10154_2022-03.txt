Footnotes
STOTLAND broke slow and bumped at the start, traveled along the inside off the pace then moved off the rail leaving the first turn, chased three deep into
stretch, angled out and rallied under left-handed urging, overtook the runner-up in the final sixteenth and inched ahead to prove best late. KO SAMUI (IRE)
stalked from inside, tipped out leaving the far turn and came three wide into the lane, rallied three deep with furlong left to run, took over past the eighth pole
and yielded to the winner in the final sixteenth. BRIGHT LEAF stalked the speed from the two path, between foes leaving the backstretch, angled to the rail
on the far turn, came out in upper stretch and finished willingly for the show. SUNDOWN WARREN got bumped leaving the gate then sped to the front, set
the pace on the inside, dueled around the far turn, lost the lead at the quarter pole but fought back into the lane, regained command in upper stretch, was
overtaken past the eighth pole and flattened out. LA'OCH ALOYSIUS raced up close outside the pacesetter, flanked that rival leaving the backstretch, bid
two wide and dueled on the second bend, took over leaving the turn and led into the stretch, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the final
furlong. RIVIERA CHAMP pulled four wide around the first turn, continued to tug a bit on the backstretch outside a rivals, chased two wide into the lane, lost
his path at the eighth pole and weakened. TRIBUTE TO AFLEET came away slow, tucked inside at the back, saved ground to the stretch and was not a
factor.

Footnotes
SIDEWAYS SUANCES vied for the lead from inside around the first turn, dueled with MO CONNELLY in the middle stages, shook free leaving the
backstretch, led two wide into the drive and drew away under right-handed urging and steady handling. MO CONNELLY vied between rivals for command,
dueled from outside up the backstretch, lost contact at the seven-sixteenths pole, went two wide around the far turn and chased the winner through the lane
and had to settle for second best. WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ chased along the rail then moved to the two path on the first turn, came two wide into the
stretch, moved out further in the lane but lacked a late bid. TEAM CONCEPT vied three deep for command around the first turn, could not keep pace with
the top pair and chased outside up the backstretch, continued three wide into the lane and weakened. BIG BELL got shuffled between rivals shortly after the
start, went three to four wide, angled in on the far turn and came up empty. KEEP IT CLASSY went two to three wide around the first turn and dropped back
to last, saved ground around the far turn and made no impact.

Footnotes
FLINT STROLL broke out, got bothered by HULK first time through the stretch and steered to the inside to stalk the pace, tipped three wide late on the
second bend, bid three deep in upper stretch and drew clear. BARNFIELD stalked in the two path, lost positions entering the far turn, got floated four wide
by FLINT STROLL on the second bend, challenged from outside then got struck by the whip from the rider of FLINT STROLL in upper stretch, could not
match strides with the winner in the late stages but finished willingly to the wire. TIZ TACT TOE got bumped from outside at the start, sped to the front and
established a clear lead, tested by rival entering the far turn, dueled around that bend, held a short lead in upper stretch then relinquished the lead with a
furlong left to run, flattened in deep stretch but saved the show. SETTECENTO got bumped leaving the gate, became rank and drifted out to bump rival
entering the first turn, chased along the rail to the lane, then tipped out and improved position. BROTHERLY LOVE bumped leaving the gate, got bumped
by inner rival entering the first turn and went three to four wide around that bend, rounded the far turn three then two wide and could not rally. HULK tracked
three wide around the first turn, bid two wide at the three-eighths pole, dueled around the far turn and into the stretch, then weakened in the furlong grounds.
TUCKER'S TRIBUTE broke out and brushed rival leaving the gate, trailed along the rail entering the stretch and not a factor. THERE WAS A RIDERS'
OBJECTION PLACED BY THE RIDER ABOARD BARNFIELD AGAINST THE RIDER OF FLINT STROLL REGARDING THE INCIDENT IN UPPER
STRETCH. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED FLINT STROLL FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR STRIKING BARNFIELD WITH
THE CROP IN UPPER STRETCH, COSTING THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
LUXURY LINER got brushed from outside at the start, forwardly placed in the earl going off the rail then between rivals, chased through the turn then took
aim leaving the bend, took over near the eight pole and kicked clear. TIZ A MASTER stalked three deep into the turn, chased the leader three wide into the
drive, was no match for LUXURY LINER in the lane and bested the rest. MUCHA WOMAN raced up close on the inside, tried to get out and became rank
around the turn, steered out in upper stretch and gained the show. MAJESTIC GIGI was off a bit slow and brushed rival at the start, sped to the front and
took control, went two wide into the turn, angled to the rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and flattened from inside. TOO MUCH HEAVEN dropped back
early, went three wide around the bend, angled out at the top of the stretch and failed to menace. SWIRLING tracked four deep into the turn, remained four
wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR broke out, bumped with outside rival early then shifted out and bumped again soon after, steadied slightly off heels on the first
turn, ranged up three wide on the second bend, took over entering the stretch, kicked clear and held safely in the end. TODAY MATTERS got bumped twice
early first time through the stretch, vied from outside early then cleared first time through the stretch, led three wide while rated on the first turn, lost
command early on the backstretch, chased that leader inside a rival, saved ground to the stretch, moved out in the lane and was gaining to the wire.
WORLD CRUISER dropped back early and angled in, steered out to the four path on the first turn, made a swift move leaving the clubhouse turn and took
over early on the backstretch, lost command entering the stretch and flattened to third. NOTHNGOODCOMSEASY was off a bit slow to begin, altered out to
the four path early on the first turn then came back to the three path, moved closer up the backstretch outside a rival, chased two wide into the drive and
lacked a serious bid. LOOKOUT POINT broke out, got shuffled between rivals early, trailed up the backstretch, angled four wide into the stretch and failed to
menace. PINEDALE rated along the inside early, ridden through the second bend while saving ground and lacked the needed response. CARPE BELLUM
broke well then stalked two to three wide on the first turn, dropped back and raced between rivals, chased two wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
EVERLYS GIRL angled out early chasing the leader, took over and cleared at the half-mile pole, opened up around the turn and widened easily under hand
urging. SAPADILLA broke slow to begin, chased along the rail into the turn, exited the bend two wide and held the place. ANNA'S MUSIC broke slow, trailed
near the inside early on, saved ground to the stretch and failed to threaten. BOLD CHOICE got forced out by EVERYLS GIRL early on chasing the leader,
bumped with MINING CRYPTO into the turn, moved to the three path around the bend and could not rally. FEELING FLUSH coaxed off the pace up the
backstretch, went four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path around the bend and was not a factor. MINING CRYPTO came away well but raced
greenly up the backstretch, bumped with rival entering the turn, continued to be hard to ride and was eased midway around around the turn, pulled up near
the eighth pole and walked off.

Footnotes
PISTACHIO PRINCESS jumped the dirt costing her some ground early, settled between rivals early, got crowded a bit at the seven-sixteenths pole and lost
some ground, went three wide into the turn then angled down to the rail, steered out in upper stretch, bid three deep and drew clear. SHE LOVES
KARAOKE displayed early speed and showed the way up the backstretch, dueled for command around the turn, maintained a short lead into the final
furlong, yielded to the winner with a sixteenth to go and stayed on for second. SPANISH CHANNEL broke well from outside, raced up close outside rivals,
challenged around the turn, kept the pressure on into the furlong grounds and never found the needed late kick. ST HELENA checked behind ROSES R
BLUE just after the dirt crossing, recovered and moved back into range up the backstretch, went between rivals and got put in tight briefly entering the turn,
exited the bend two to three wide and faltered. ROSES R BLUE was off a bit slow, went up to race inside the pacesetter early, checked at the three-eighths
pole then bobbled soon after, remained inside to the stretch and weakened. FULL SPEED ASTERN dropped early, steered to the inside, angled out leaving
the turn and made no impact. DANCE LADY tracked the pace off the rail, entered the turn three deep, slipped past the quarter pole and faded.

Footnotes
SPEED BOAT showed early speed and set a pressured pace into the turn, tested by rival around the bend, cleared into the stretch and drew off.
CONUNDRUM tossed his head and came away a bit slow, went up to be forwardly placed on the inside, saved ground to the lane and bested the rest. BIG
WELL came out a bit and got bumped in the hindquarters then drifted out soon after early in the race, chased off the rail then, between foes at the quarter
pole, went between another pair at the eighth pole and got edged for the place. LITTLE MISCHIEF was off alertly then drifted out early, pressed the pace
from outside into the turn, dueled for command around the bend, lost contact into the stretch and weakened. SAFE COMBINATION sat off the pace early
on, rounded the turn five wide and never threatened. HEAD FOR BUSINESS got bumped in the beginning, dropped back off the pace, took the turn four
wide and could not rally. BOB DANIELS got bumped on both sides leaving the, was pinched shortly after and checked hard, raced in range outside a rival,
three deep leaving the turn and faded through the lane. ERIK THE VIKING got pinballed at the start and checked hard, raced near the back of the pack
between foes leaving the backstretch, went two wide into the lane and never rallied. CEE E OH broke a bit slow, saved ground trailing through the turn and
was not a factor. CANDY FURY threw his head, leaned back and came away very slow, raced three deep at the back early on, went four wide into the
stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BOCHOMBO sped to the front and set the pace up the backstretch, showed the way along the inside into the lane, challenged by a pair of rivals in upper
stretch and turned away both foes to win clear. SMUGGLER'S RUN shifted out and bumped rival early, tracked along the inside, tipped out and brushed
rival at the top of the lane, bid between foes in upper stretch but got turned away by the winner. HIGHLAND GHOST broke well and raced up close from
outside, flanked the leader leaving the backstretch, chased two wide around the bend, got brushed from inside at the top of the stretch, bid three deep in the
lane, lacked then needed late punch and stayed on to secure the show. DOITFORANDREW (GB) bumped repeatedly with ECHOSMITH (IRE) early,
chased between foes into the turn, tipped three wide leaving the bend, angled out in upper stretch and missed the show. SHUT UP MICHAEL (IRE) dropped
back early and then steered to the inside, ran up behind rival and was on heels from the seven-sixteenths pole to the three-eighths pole, remained inside
through the turn, coaxed along leaving the bend tipped to the two path in the lane but needed to find more in the furlong grounds. ECHOSMITH (IRE) got
pinballed and checked hard between foes early, chased two wide on the turn and could not rally. OLYMPIC LEGEND stalked off the rail then three deep into
the turn, lost ground three wide around the bend and weakened. DIAMOND DIGGER bobbled at the start, jumped the dirt early, trailed through the turn and
was never a factor. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE INCIDENT EARLY IN THE RACE AND RULED THAT SMUGGLER'S RUN, ECHOSMITH (IRE),
AND DOITFORANDREW (GB) ALL CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR PROBLEMS AND BLAME COULD NOT BE ASSIGNED TO ANY ONE RUNNER SO NO
CHANGE WAS MADE.
