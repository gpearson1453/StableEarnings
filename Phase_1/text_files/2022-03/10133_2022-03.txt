Footnotes
HARBOR KNIGHT stalked comfortably along the inside, tipped outside of the leader turning for home to bid entering the lane, and edged clear therafter. MY
GUITAR saved ground off of the pace, improved inside of foes turning for home before tipping to the three path in upper stretch while claiming show, then
stayed on to reach place late. MUSADA rated along on a loose lead in the two path, but was headed by the eventual winner at the three sixteenths pole,
yielded, and lost place in the final sixteenth. SIR POKERFACE settled off of the pace in the three path, tipped to the five path turning for home, gained mildly
outside of foes entering the lane, then leveled off. HIGH RIDGE tracked two wide, ranged up to the leading pair from the four path around the far turn, but
flattened out between horses in upper stretch. SEMI CHARMED LIFE stalked outside of the leader and from the two path, but weakened between horses
turning for home. TIN DELAY trailed throughout.

Footnotes
VEILS AND VOWS stalked along the inside, bid for the lead inside of the pace-setter at the five sixteenths pole, led at the quarter pole, dueled through
midstretch as her outer counterpart fought on, and edged clear entering the final sixteenth. VICIOUS VELMA set the pace in the two path, allowed ample rail
racing room for VEILS AND VOWS to slip through and bid at the five sixteenths pole, got headed entering the lane, fought on through midstretch, but
yielded a sixteenth out. C C'S FREEDOM tracked two wide, improved inside of rivals entering the lane, and was best of the rest. DRESSEDTOIMPRESS
settled at the rear along the inside, gained mildly in the five path around the far turn, but failed to threaten. TETHERED tracked in the four path, but tired
between horses entering the lane. C C'S COWGIRL prompted the pace two wide and from the three path, but weakened between horses at the three
furlong pole. LA DANTA took the first turn in the five path while at the rear of the field, and was outrun.

Footnotes
MA CHERIE tracked in midpack from the four path, chased the clear leader through upper stretch, stayed on in the final furlong as the leader tired, bid
entering the final sixteenth along with an inner DIAMOND INDY SKIES, prevailed over that foe soon after, and shifted in slightly approaching the wire.
DIAMOND INDY SKIES broke a step slowly at the start, recovered to stalk the leader from the three path, chased that clear rival through upper stretch while
inside of MA CHERIE, bid entering the final sixteenth along the her outer counterpart, but was outkicked soon after, then was taken firmly in hand when that
rival shifted in and brushed her approaching the wire. SWEET TRUFFLES tracked from off of the pace two wide, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and
stayed on to reach show late. QUEEN CORDELIA broke outwardly, set a clear pace in the two path, widened her advantage turning for home, but tired
approaching the final furlong, and was overhauled passing the sixteenth pole. DIAL IT UP A NOTCH laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted two wide at
the quarter pole, then back inwardly in midstretch, but only managed to chase and failed to produce a bid. SUPER FIRE stalked along the inside, but tired
through the lane. TRAFALGAR SHORE broke a step slowly before being pushed outwardly by an inner foe at the start, trailed the field in the three path
around the turn, and was outrun. THE RIDER OF DIAMOND INDY SKIES CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MA CHERIE FOR INTERFERENCE
IN DEEP STRETCH, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS stalked along the inside, tipped two wide entering the lane while just behind the top pair, then outside of them approaching the
furlong grounds, grinded away while hanging on his left lead to bid in the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage late. MOMENT set the pace along the
inside, vied inside of REDOUX down the backstretch, the inside of a pair of rivals after SI ES GOYA bid turning for home, dueled gamely with the latter
through the lane, prevailed in the battle, but was outkicked by a wider bidder late. SI ES GOYA stalked two wide, ranged up three wide around the far turn,
cleared an inner foe passing the quarter pole to spar with MOMENT through the lane, but flopped back to her left lead entering the final sixteenth as an
outer foe menaced, and was bested between horses. WOMAN WITH A BOOK laid off of the pace two wide, improved inside of a foe at the five furlong pole
while a path off of the rail, chased the leading quartet as their closest pursuer around the far turn, got floated five wide in upper stretch, but failed to threaten
thereafter. REDOUX prompted the pace three to two wide around the first turn, vied entering the backstretch, then from between horses turning for home,
but weakened entering the lane. OCTOBER SURPRISE raced far back along the inside, took the far turn in the four path, and passed tired rivals in the lane.
EASTSIDE BOY raced far back in the three to two paths, and failed to factor. FULL OF RUN trailed in the four path around the first turn, and was outrun.
JURISDICTION raced in midpack in the three path, but tired around the far turn.

Footnotes
SUMITUP bumped an outer foe at the start, rushed clear soon after, widened his advantage under a vigorous hand ride in upper stretch, and was driven in
the final furlong to seal the deal. MISS UNDERRATED trailed early on after bobbling a bit a few strides after the start, gained four to five wide turning for
home, and stayed on to reach place at the sixteenth pole. A. K. A. GRAMS prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace entering the lane while
proving no match for the leader, then lost place a sixteenth from home. GOODNIGHT GRACIE was brushed by an inner foe soon after the start, raced far
back three wide, improved among foes in upper stretch, and failed to threaten. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA laid off of the pace two wide, chased from inside of
rivals in upper stretch, but faded in the final furlong. VELVET NIGHT was bumped by an inner foe at the start and forced to brush an outer foe soon after,
laid off of the pace along the inside, but was shuffled back behind a tiring SHO NUFF turning for home to trail the field at the five sixteenths pole, swung five
wide in upper stretch, but offered no rally on her left lead. BOX OF PICTURES stalked three wide, but weakened four wide and between horses entering the
lane. SHO NUFF tracked along the inside, but faded at the three furlong pole, and stopped.

Footnotes
HONORARY GUEST stalked along the inside, shifted two wide entering the lane to aim to split foes, did so at the three sixteenths pole after outer foes got
jumps, grinded away passing the furlong pole to bid inside of those rivals, forged an advantage from PLANTS AND BIRDS a sixteenth out, dueled with that
foe to the wire, and held. PLANTS AND BIRDS settled off of the pace in the three path, inched closer in the five path and outside of foes turning for home,
got herded to the seven path in upper stretch, rallied approaching midstretch while shifting a bit inwardly to bid, led narrowly at the furlong grounds, but was
headed by an inner foe at the sixteenth pole, battled on while on his left lead to the wire, but missed. FREEZE THE DAY leaned inwardly at the start, tugged
two wide and between horses to track in midpack around the first turn, but continued to fight with the rider causing him to be wrangled back into the far turn,
took that bend three wide and off of the pace, tipped to the six path at the quarter pole, then shifted back inwardly for clear sailing between horses at the
furlong grounds, grinded away while getting outkicked by an inner foe at that marker, then kept on between the top pair through the late stages. TURF
DANCER tracked in the four path, stalked the top pair around the far turn from that path, drifted a few paths outwardly at quarter pole, kept on to vie for the
lead between horses while drifting inwardly approaching the final furlong, continued to wander about while flopping leads through midstretch, then
weakened between horses in the final sixteenth. DOVE WITH A CAUSE set the pace along the inside, vied inside of a rival while in the two path around the
far turn, got headed by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, then gave way to outer rivals at the furlong grounds. I GOT WINGS saved ground off of the pace,
but faded in upper stretch. VALIANT MINI STAR stalked three wide, pressed in the three path down the backstretch, vied two wide while remaining in the
three path around the far turn, led narrowly at the five sixteenths pole, but weakened between horses passing the three sixteenths marker. JUNIE trailed in
the five path around the first turn, then failed to keep pace with the field down the backstretch, showed little, and was eased through the lane.

OUTLIER set the pace inside of a pressing INVISIBLE WAR, met PERFECT CUT's bid turning for home as the prior faltered, repelled the latter and shook
clear in upper stretch, the held from a re-rallying aforementioned foe in the closing stages. INVISIBLE WAR prompted the pace two wide, chased under
urging around the far turn while getting outmoved by an outer rival turning for home, tipped outside of the top two approaching the final furlong while
regaining stride, then resurged in the closing stages, but missed. PERFECT CUT stalked three wide, bid for the lead turning for home, but flattened out in
upper stretch, then got outkicked for place a sixteenth from home. SOUL COAXING tracked two wide and between horses, then along the inside around the
far turn after an inner foe gave way, required left rein restraint while wanting to get out turning for home, tipped outside of the leading trio in upper stretch,
but lacked a bid. AMERICAN SMOOTH stalked along the inside, but faded around the far turn. HORNSWOGGLE brushed the inner part of the gate at the
start, and was outrun.

Footnotes
EVAN SING tracked in the four path while outside of a pair of stalking foes around the turn, ranged up to bid at the three sixteenths pole, led approaching
the final furlong, and inched clear of inner foes late. TWENTYONE N CHANGE set a clear pace around the turn, met a pair of outer bids at the three
sixteenths pole, got headed by his widest rival approaching the furlong grounds, then fended off his most immediate outer counterpart for place. MAHONEY
ROAD stalked along the inside while a path off of the rail, bid between horses in upper stretch, but was outkicked approaching the furlong grounds, switched
outside of that foe entering the final sixteenth, and kept on, but failed to reach place. TEMPO MADNESS tracked in the two path, but only managed to chase
the leaders home without gaining. EYE DEE KAY bumped an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, swung to the five path entering the
lane, but failed to threaten while mildly staying on and hanging on his left lead. ART HEIST broke a step slowly before being bumped by an outer foe at the
start, took the turn in the five path while off of the pace, and failed to factor. LEVEE PROUD stalked outside of the clear leader, but faded in the three path
and between horses at the five sixteenths pole, then weakened through the lane. SMOOTH CUSTOM was outrun.

Footnotes
GRADED VISION bumped an inner foe at the start, set the pace along the inside, dueled with an outer bidding CUSTOM PRAYER through upper stretch,
and repelled that foe approaching the final sixteenth. CUSTOM PRAYER prompted the pace two wide, bid turning for home, dueled through the lane while
hanging on his left lead, and yielded approaching the sixteenth pole. MR ELVIN was bumped and forced inwardly by an outer foe at the start, chased along
the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, and kept on, but failed to gain. PERMANENTDETENTION tossed his head while being briefly
held by the assistant starter, then raced off of the pace along the inside, moved up entering the lane, but failed to menace. CATCHIN DRAMA took up soon
after the start to avoid trouble from outer rivals, then saved ground far off of the pace, and stayed on through the lane. HEZA SEXY ZONG took a solid
bump while being severely bothered by an outer foe at the start, race in midpack in the four path, but tired through the lane. IRON FORTUNE hopped
inwardly and lunged into an inner rival at the start, raced in midpack while staying wide around the turn, and faded. JUSTA BUSTER broke through the gate
just before the rest of the stalls opened, then was severely bothered by an outer rival, and never got involved. BIG MERRILL was held by the assistant
starter when the gates opened causing him to drastically hop inwardly , then was distanced throughout, and walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY, PERMANENTDETENTION, JUSTA BUSTER, AND BIG MERRILL WERE DECLARED NON-STARTERS.
