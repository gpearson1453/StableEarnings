BEE MAJOR settled mid pack, but was always in striking distance and measuring his fences well, he got in gear jumping the last coming up on the inside,
dueled with CAUSE FOR PARDON in the stretch but drew clear in the final strides. CAUSE FOR PARDON stalked the leader for the the first mile and a
half, then took over the lead heading to the second last, had a clear advantage heading to the last, still had the advantage jumping the last, then dueled with
the winner then gave way in the final stages. FREDDY FLINTSHIRE setttled in the back, came with a rush on the final bend to get in contention heading to
the last jump, but flatened out from there. WESTERLAND (GB) settled mid pack but lacked response when called upon. TOM showed the way for the first
mile and a half, then stopped before the second last jump. REAL FACTOR saddle slipped and was pulled up before the the sixth jump walked of.

BOULETTE (IRE) took command from the start, controled the race on the front end and was much the best here. ANIMAL KINGSTON settled mid pack and
well placed, rallied two fences from home to track the leader heading to the last fence but was no match for the winner. BOSS MAN stalked the pace for
most of the race, hook up with ANIMAL KINSTON two fences from home battled with that rival through the stretch but could not hang on for the place spot.
GLENCORRIB SKY (IRE) raced towards the back and was through heading into the final bend and was no threat from there. GLOBAL FREEDOM (GB)
raced in the back and kept falling back and was no factor here. KNOCandKHOLT trailed the field and was pulled up at the 9th jump.

GAYE BREEZE (IRE) settled mid pack and was well placed, got in gear on the final turn to be right there jumping the last, battled with several rivals after the
last, and prevailed at the wire. DON'T SHOUT (IRE) stalked the leader most of the way, rallied on the final bend to have a slight advantage jumping the last,
dueled with the winner through the stretch but could not get up for the win. FIGHTINIRISHTABIT was allowed to settle mid pack, rallied on the final turn to
be in the mix jumping the last, then flattened out. HOOROO (IRE) showed the way until heading for home, still in the mix jumping the last, then weaken
through the stretch. THREE O ONE was finished after a mile and a half, and stopped on the backside for the final time and kept losing touch with the field.
TRICKED UP raced mid pack, started to tire going down the back side for the final time and losing ground every step of the way. PEAT MOSS (IRE) was in
contention when he made a terrible mistake jumpin the fourth hurdle almost losing in his rider, the rider recovered but could not get both feet in the irons, so
he pulled up before the fifth jump and walked off. JUMP SHIP refused to enter the starters box.
