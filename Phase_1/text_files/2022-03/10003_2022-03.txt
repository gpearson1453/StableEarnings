Footnotes
MOOGIE CAT cleared quickly, continued clear on the turn, and held sway under mild urging in the lane. MARKSMAN ON TARGET chased leader along the
inside, continued along the inside on the turn, and stayed on to hold second comfortably. W. WHITEHOUSE stalked pace three wide on the backstretch,
had to stay three wide due to riderless horse on the turn, and lacked needed rally in the lane to improve. SOUL PRODIGY false broke just before the gates
opening causing the assistant starter to grab a hold, thus breaking slow, stalked four wide on the turn and failed to produce a rally in the lane, declared non
starter. RUN MANNY RUN as the gates opened the assistant starter held RUN MANNY RUN causing the horse to rear and losing the rider at the start.
AFTER STEWARDS INQUIRY, SOUL PRODIGY WAS DECLARED A NON STARTE IN A MAJORITY DECISION, RUN MANNY RUN WAS RULED TO
HAVE CAUSED OWN TROUBLE AND DECALRED A STARTER
