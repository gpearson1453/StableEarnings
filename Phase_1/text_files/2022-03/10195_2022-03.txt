Footnotes
HEART RIVER was away in good order to duel for the lead with CRAZY GOOD while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and
drew off with complete authority. DODROPIN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the
drive but finished well to gain the place. CRAZY GOOD broke sharply to dispute the pace from the inside with the winner and gave way through the final
furlong. NAVARONES SPARKLE bobbled at the break, settled off the leaders early and lacked the needed rally. CROOKHAVEN LASS raced off the
pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and did not threaten. CHICKS DIG MUNNY showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. FANCY GI GI was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. KANDI SPUN raced off the leaders
early, moved six-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
SEEKING REFUGE settled off the leaders early, advanced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch, wore down
NOLONGERAHOBBY in the closing yards to be going away late. NOLONGERAHOBBY raced off the pacesetters early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid
nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin but could not hold the winner safe late. VICENTE'S SHADOW lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the
second turn and finished with good late energy. T BONES TRICK was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the second turn,
reached a contending position but failed to gain late. OPTIMISTIC VALOR chased the leaders while racing three-wide, angled in approaching the stretch
and gave way through the final furlong. N. K. ROCKET MAN broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside with HIT THE SEAM, appeared hard to rate
and weakened after going three-quarters. HIT THE SEAM was away in good order to dispute the pace with N. K. ROCKETMAN while racing three-wide and
weakened after going six furlongs. DILLON ROCKS was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened.

once, responded when challenged by DR. ANGEL nearing the three-eighths pole, vied with the foe and gave way through the final furlong. DR. ANGEL
pressed the pace of PARTY POLICE while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the three-eighths marker, vied, drifted out nearing the
quarter, checked in mid-stretch and failed to gain late. ROCKIN IN settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. DIZZY
LIZZY lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. SWEET BABY RUTHIE showed no early speed, raced four-wide through
the turn and was not a factor. HIGH KELLY BABE was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace.

Footnotes
BACK ALLEY CAT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
opened a clear margin into the lane and held sway to the wire. WARRIORS HERO was off slow, lagged early, ,moved six-wide through the second turn and
finished with good energy. STEAL HOME was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished with
a late rally. ROUSING RUBBLE set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the nine-sixteenths pole and gave way after going three-quarters.
OFF THE BOOKS was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and gradually gave way. AUTISM SIBLINGS raced four-wide
through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. ADD ON was away in good order to chase the leaders
while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
ELLIE CAN PLAY was away in good order to duel for the lead with WREXHAM while racing three-wide, disposed of that rival nearing the five-sixteenths
marker, opened a clear margin and held sway to the wire. EYES FOR GOLD settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished
with a steady bid. WEDDING CHAPEL lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. CURLIN BLESSING was
forwardly placed early, ,moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and back out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished evenly.
CHOCOLATE FRECKLES chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. MS GLORY BEACH was void of early speed,
raced seven-wide through the turn and did not menace. TAP ME A TEXT showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
WREXHAM broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner and weakened after going a half. MACLEAN'S BELLA stumbled at the start, lost the rider and
was vanned off.

Footnotes
DEPARTURE dueled for the lead with BLACK OPS while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and drew off. BALTIMORE
BEECHO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the
place. SOMETHING SUPER was away alertly then settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. SWAMP
SOUFFLE was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. CAIRO KING pressed the pace while racing four-wide
and gave way through the final furlong. BLACK OPS disputed the pace from the inside for a half and weakened. SMARTY RIVER PANTS was void of early
foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SHARP DRESSED BEAU was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and
gradually weakened. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
NOT NECESSARILY was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, was well rated through the back-stretch, opened a clear lead into the
lane and drew off through the final furlong. CLUB MESQUITE pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide throughout and failed to gain on that
rival in the drive. BLUES RAPPER lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a late bid.
MISAWA settled off the leaders from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. CHARMING VINTAGE chased the leaders while racing three-wide
and gave way after going five furlongs. MONTANA JACK was bumped at the break, raced four-wide through the first turn, was forwardly placed and raced
five-wide through the second turn and weakened after going five-eighths. OCTAVIUS PRIME was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, saved ground
through the second turn and was not a factor. HIGH FLYIN TIGER lagged throughout.
