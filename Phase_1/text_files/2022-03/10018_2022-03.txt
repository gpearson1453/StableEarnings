Footnotes
ROCK N ROLL SONG was away alertly and was sent to set prompted fractions through the second turn, opened the lead approaching the top of the lane,
felt pressure in the end from MOONSHINE CAT but held on under steady urging to prevail. MOONSHINE CAT prompted the early pace to the far turn, lost
ground nearing the quarter-marker, closed well in the late stages and could not quite reel in the winner in the final strides but was well clear of the rest for
second. ROUSING YOU BABE stalked the pace outside of foes, was outrun into the drive and was not a threat in the final stages. VALDINI was away a
step slowly and settled off of the pace while saving ground, stuck to the inside on the far turn, lost ground into the stretch run and gave way in the late
stages.

Footnotes
HAWK HILL was pinched at the start and was a bit slow in the early stages, improved position on the turn to be two wide between foes, mounted an inside
bid in the stretch, took command nearing the sixteenth-marker and edged clear in the end. BORKAN was bothered at the start and was off slowly, recovered
to stalk the pace outside of rivals on the turn, closed ground in the stretch run and was not able to reel in the winner but was up in time for the place.
MYSTIC TRAVELER broke in at the start, stalked the pace from a ground saving position on the turn, made a late gain in the drive and was not able to reel
in the top pair but was up in time for the show. CORSICAN tracked the moderately fast pace through the turn, vied for the lead leaving the furlong marker
and was outfinished in the late stages while on the left lead. LEMON ZINGER was hustled to set the moderately fast pace, came under pressure leaving the
turn and gave way in the late going. CIRCLE BACK chased the early pace to the turn, was three wide between foes nearing the quarter-marker, steadied in
tight traffic approaching the top of the lane and weakened in the final stages.

RAILSPLITTER was away in good order and took command of the early pace into the first turn, set moderate fractions while being prompted to the half-mile,
extended the lead on the far turn and drew clear in the late stages under hand urging. AWESOME DUDE was keen along the first turn and steadied in tight
quarters, settled while saving ground along the backstretch run, lost ground to RAILSPLITTER while chasing into the lane and was outkicked in the end but
kept on to earn the place. MOUNT PELLIAR was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground through the second turn, gave ground into the stretch run and
did not offer a late bid in the drive. MAYBE SOMETIME settled just off of the early pace, was steered two wide on the second turn, was outrun into the
stretch and weakened in the late going. HANDS OFF stalked the pace outside of rivals, lost ground on the far turn and gave way in the stretch drive. TIME
IS GONE was forwardly placed in the early stages, lost ground on the second turn while two wide between rivals and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
VANTAGE POINT tracked the pace while outside of rivals and under a snug hold through the first half-mile, edged closer to SEAHAWK CODY nearing the
quarter-maker, overtook that foe leaving the furlong grounds and kicked clear in the late stages. HARBOR SKY saved ground while just off of the pace,
improved position along the rail on the far turn, was outkicked in the stretch run but closed in the late stages to earn the nod for second in a blanket finish.
EL JOY was allowed to settle in the early going while saving ground, was roused leaving the far turn, gained ground in the stretch and just missed for
second while holding for third in the end. SEAHAWK CODY was hustled leaving the gate and set the pace while being prompted by VANTAGE POINT,
could not hold off the winner nearing the furlong marker, kept on in mid stretch but was outfinished in the end while just missing for the minor awards.
CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS was forwardly placed while between rivals through the backstretch run, was three wide in tight quarters on the second turn and
was outclosed in the stretch run. SUGAR BEETS settled off of the pace in the early stages, was steered four wide on the second turn while gaining ground
but tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
GRINNINGEARTOEAR chased the early fractions while saving ground, angled out leaving the turn, closed fast in the final sixteenth and was up just in time
to prevail. CANAM GAL pressed the pace from a two wide path on the turn, lost a bit of ground to HOT RAGEOUS into the stretch run, closed on that foe in
the late stages but could not hold off the fast closing winner and was nipped for the win while holding for the place. HOT RAGEOUS was away alertly and
was sent to set the fractions while being pressed, had a clear lead at the furlong grounds, could not hold off the top pair in the late stages and was
outfinished, while holding for the show. MARILYN'S SMILE settled off of the early pace while widest on the turn, rallied into the stretch drive and just missed
for third. EYE ON TIGER tracked the pace three wide on the turn and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
COMMAND A PREMIUM was away alertly and set disputed fractions through the turn, was challenged through the lane by HOLIDAY HUSTLE, held that
one at bay through the final stages and dug in in the final strides to prevail in a good debut. HOLIDAY HUSTLE engaged with COMMAND A PREMIUM
soon after the break and dueled with that foe while setting quick fractions through the turn, continued to duel into the drive and could not reel in the winner in
the end but was best of the rest. TABLE FOR TWO chased the pace three wide on the turn, closed in the stretch and held for the show in the late stages.
BOLDACIOUS stalked the early pace to the turn, was two wide between foes on the turn, was outkicked in the drive but ran on willingly in the end and just
missed for third. TIZ A THRILL saved ground while tracking the early pace, improved position approaching the top of the lane, steadied in tight quarters
leaving the turn and was outfinished in the final stages. THE LONNA RANGER was off a step slowly, chased the pace from a three position through the turn
and did not offer a late bid. WEAR THE CROWN was away a bit slowly, chased the pace from the rear while outside of foes and did not mount a late rally.

Footnotes
IL BELLATOR stalked the early pace outside of rivals on the first turn, improved position along the second turn, made a three wide bid into the stretch to
take command and drew clear in the end. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH bobbled at the start and took back in the early going to settle off of the pace, saved
ground into the second turn, was outkicked in the stretch run but kept on to earn the place. NUESTRO ENGREIDO was away alertly and set the pace
through the second turn, was confronted by the winner approaching the furlong grounds, could not hold off IL BELLATOR but kept on in the final stages to
be a clear third. BANDERA AZTECA was off a step slowly and settled off of the early pace, gained ground three wide on the second turn but lacked a final
kick in the stretch run. LYING GHOST lacked early speed while outside of rivals on the first turn, was steered to the two path on the second turn and was
not a threat in the late going. LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM was a bit rank on the first turn, settled along the backstretch run to attend to the pace into the second
turn, closed on the pacesetter nearing the quarter-marker and gave way in the late stages. MEETMEATTHECLUB was forwardly placed in the early stages,
tracked the pace while still in aim on the second turn and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
MOHAWK KING (IRE) broke sharply and was sent to the front to set the pace, was engaged by TRASH TALKIN CAT along the backstretch run while
setting reasonably fast fractions, shook free of that pressing rival into the stretch, was pressured in the final stages by the oncoming runner-up and just
lasted under firm handling in the end. BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) stalked the pace to the half-mile, was steered outside of foes along the second turn, closed
well in the final stages and could not reel in the winner in the end but held for the place. LOAFERS BOY was away a bit slowly, settled off of the early pace
while saving ground, was steered five wide outside of rivals on the second turn, made up ground into the stretch run and continued that rally into the final
stages to get the nod for the show. BOTTLE OF SMOKE settled just off of the early pace while traveling in the second flight, gained ground on the second
turn and was just edged out in the end for third. GOVENOR'S PARTY was reluctant to load and was away a step slowly, settled off of the pace while outside
of rivals, gained ground into the stretch run and closed willingly in the end to challenge for the show. BARHOPSKY was off slowly in the beginning and
settled in the early stages while saving ground, stayed along the inside into the second turn, was roused nearing the quarter-marker and finished well in the
late going. TRASH TALKIN CAT tracked the early pace then was given rein along the backstretch to press the pace to the second turn, was outrun into the
stretch and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
PRESKITT broke sharply and was sent to the front at the start, was pressed into the turn by FIRE ME UP, shook free of that rival into the stretch run, was
kept to task through the late stages and was ridden out in the end. HOT ROCKETTE chased the fast pace from the midflight, was two wide along the turn,
swung widest into the drive, made a mild late gain in the final stages and was clear of the rest for the place. JUSTHAPPENLIKETHAT hopped at the start,
chased the pace from a two wide path on the turn, lacked a final kick in the stretch run but was a clear third. MIRACLE IN MOTION lacked early speed while
saving ground on the turn and passed tiring foes in the stretch run. FIRST TIME PLAYER chased the fast early pace to the turn, lost ground nearing the
quarter-marker and tired in the late stages. JOHNEEDWNTHESTREET chased the pace from the inside on the turn and gave way in the stretch.
COCORITA chased the fast pace outside of rivals and weakened in the stretch run. FIRE ME UP was fractious in the post parade, confronted the winner
soon after the break and pressed the fast pace to the quarter-marker, was outrun into the drive and gave out in the late stages.
