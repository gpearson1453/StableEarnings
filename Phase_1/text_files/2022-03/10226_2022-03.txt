Footnotes
LT. JUNIOR GRADE stalked the clear leader from the two path around the turn, chased that foe without progressing through upper stretch, shifted inside of
that drifting rival in the final furlong, grinded away to produce a bid in the late stages, and got up approaching the wire. DESOTO'S WAR was sent clear
early on, showed the way while a bit off of the rail, then drifted outwardly in the final furlong while hanging on his left lead, and got nailed by an inner foe late.
LOOKIN HIGH laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on while hanging on his left lead to reach show late.
GEMO RAIN tracked in the three path, but failed to threaten the top pair before losing show late. DA GOLD ROOM broke a beat slowly, tracked along the
inside, but faded. PAYNT BATTLE broke a step slowly, and showed little.

Footnotes
AMERICAN FIRST set the pace, then from a bit off of the rail as CARLOS LOVES TEE menaced around the far turn, repelled that rival at the furlong
grounds, and drew clear. LUCKY LINDA bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside, chased along the rail through the lane to duel for place
in the late stages, and prevailed for that position. CARLOS LOVES TEE stalked two wide, pressed in the three path around the far turn, bid approaching the
lane, but was repelled at the furlong grounds, vied for place with an inner foe through the late stages, but was nailed. BAD GAL RIRI bumped with an outer
rival at the start, rated far back along the inside, gained between horses into the far turn, then stayed on mildly. PAT HAND GIRL laid far back in the four
path, swung to the eight path entering the lane, and moved up. CONSERVATVE VALUES stumbled at the start, raced off of the pace in the four path
around both turns, shifted to the seven path approaching the lane, and failed to factor while never being asked for his best run. CAJUN ACES tracked three
wide, but faded in the five path turning for home. JULIA'S CHANCE came in and bumped a foe soon after the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but to
no avail. GERRIE LOU took a solid bump to her hind quarters soon after the start, and made little impact. LANDWOMAN'S GIFT was outrun. SWIFT N'
STORMY raced in midpack in the two path around the first turn, but was done early.

while inside of a rival entering the lane, split rivals in upper stretch to lead at the furlong grounds, drove clear shortly after, and lasted from an outer rallying
rival late. GLITTERARY settled far back along the inside, shifted to the three path around the far turn while tracking among rivals, got outmoved by an outer
foe approaching the lane before shifting to the five path entering it, then rallied in midstretch, gained outside of foes in the final furlong, flopped back to his
left lead entering the final sixteenth, sustained a late bid, but missed. BLAME THE GODS rated far back three wide, gained in the four path around the far
turn, got floated to the five path by an inner foe entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, but was outkicked at the furlong grounds, and yielded. PLATINUM
QUEEN stalked outside of the pace setter while in the three path, pressed that foe into the far turn, bid turning for home, vied among foes through upper
stretch, but tired at the furlong grounds. RUNAWAY HENNY laid off of the pace two wide, retreated to trail the field approaching the far turn, saved ground
around that bend, moved up entering the lane, but encountered a wall of traffic while in the two path through upper stretch, then failed to keep pace with
outer bidders approaching the furlong grounds, shifted out, and lacked a rally on her left lead. LIMITLESS MAZIE set the pace along the inside, then from
the two path while an outer rival pressed, but was headed in upper stretch, and weakened shortly after. PAYTONSATTHEPLATE raced at the rear in the
two path around both turns, swung to the six path entering the lane, but failed to factor.

Footnotes
ZUMRA BAYOU bumped with an inner foe at the start, set a narrowly clear pace from a pair of chasing rivals, then drew off at the quarter pole, and widened
under driving pressure. BUT ANYWAY broke a beat slowly, saved ground in midpack, tipped to the four path and outside of the leading trio passing the
quarter pole, then stayed on to claim place entering the final sixteenth without threatening the leader. MO BELLA stalked two wide from the three path
around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the clear leader at the quarter pole while prevailing over her inner counterpart for place, but was surpassed by
an outer rival for that position a sixteenth from hom. SEEMYVALENTINE tracked from midpack two wide and between horses around the turn, but was
floated to the five path by an inner foe passing the quarter pole, and lacked a rally. SWEET JACKIELEIGH saved ground far off of the pace, then moved up
a bit off of the rail through the lane. COSMIC BELLE stalked along the inside, but tired approaching midstretch. RYDENSEEK was last away, trailed along
the inside, and improved along the rail through the lane. STOP SHOP N DROP raced in midpack in the five path and outside of rivals around the turn, came
into the lane in the six path, and faded. A. P. STYLE brushed the gate while breaking a bit slowly, took the turn in the five path while far back, then failed to
factor in the seven path through the lane. CUSTOM GUITAR raced far back in the three path and between horses around the turn, but made little impact.
LISTEN JAN bumped an outer rival at the start, and never got involved. YES I'M A LADY raced forwardly placed in the four path and outside of foes early
on, but weakened between horses around the turn.

Footnotes
CYPRIANO stalked the run-off leader from the two path, ranged up to that foe on his own power turning for home, bid when let out at the furlong grounds,
and drove clear under mild hand urging. CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT laid off of the pace in the two to three path, chased outside of a rival while gaining along
with that foe from the three path around the far turn, but failed to match rallying strides while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, drifted out a bit in the
process, then kept on in the closing stages to reach place approaching the wire. THE GREEN MO'STER set the pace, opened up a large margin down the
backstretch, but came back to the field turning for home, proved no match for an outer bidding foe at the furlong grounds as the rider took a look back for
competition, tired thereafter, and lost place late. LATE NITE MISCHIEF laid at the rear along the inside early on, then took the far turn in the four path while
off of the pace, and failed to menace. RUN ROCKET laid far back in the three to four path around the first turn, then in the five path around the far turn, and
made little impact. BIG FALCON ROCKET tracked along the inside while a bit off of the rail, and faded. MUSCADINE never got involved.

CANADA'S CUSTOMS comfortably stalked the leading brawling leading group from the two path, smoothly split those rivals in the three path at the three
sixteenths pole, quickly took chare soon after, and drew off under mild urging. BASALT STREET prompted the pace four wide and between horses, but was
outkicked by an inner foe at the three sixteenths pole, then kept on to gain place from an outer rival approaching the final sixteenth. NON BINDING bobbled
into the outer part of the starting gate when it opened, trailed the field in the three path around the turn, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and
rallied willingly outside of foes to gain show at the wire. WON DAY vied three wide and between horses in the scrabble for the front early on, led turning for
home, but drifted outwardly in upper stretch, was swiftly outkicked by an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole, tired while losing place approaching the final
sixteenth, and got nailed for show. NONEYA pressed the leading quartet from the outside into the turn, but was floated to the seven path while failing to
keep pace at the three sixteenths pole, and yielded. KNIGHTS SWORD was fractious in the gate pre-race, then was hard sent early on to vie for the lead
inside of a trio of outer rivals, but failed to keep pace passing the three furlong pole, and faded. LIL ADEAU vied for the lead two wide and among the
leading group, sustained contention while inside of the leader turning for home, but faded at the three sixteenths pole. MOMENT TO DREAM was fractious
in the starting gate, tracked from off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
GHOSTING KIM trailed in the three path, swung to the nine path in upper stretch, rallied in the outer part of the track on top of better footing, flopped back to
her left lead approaching the final sixteenth before completing a bid passing that marker, and edged an advantage late. ASSERTIVE STYLE tracked in the
three to four path before tipping to the six path entering the lane, rallied on her left lead to bid approaching the furlong grounds, changed to her right lead
and inched clear, but met GHOSTING KIM's stern challenge a sixteenth from home, and was worn down. EMRO vied for the lead two wide and between
horses while in the four path around the turn, but was outmoved by her outer rival turning for home, fought on through upper stretch to re-bid entering the
final furlong, but was outkicked by an outer bidder soon after, and yielded. SAIL ON ELLEN prompted the leading pair from the outside and in the five path
around the turn, bid at the five sixteenths pole, led passing that marker, but hung on her left lead in upper stretch, got headed by rivals on either side
approaching the final furlong, and weakened between. SHELLBY set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals while in the three path around the turn, but was
headed by her outermost counterpart leaving the five sixteenths pole, and weakened on her left lead in upper stretch.

Footnotes
RUN NATALIE RUN stalked close up along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair passing the quarter pole, chased PINEAPPLE ALLEY into the final
furlong, shifted outwardly to remain outside of that drifted foe leaving that station, then bid entering the final sixteenth as that foe tired, and drove clear.
OURS AND THEIRS tracked from midpack, shifted to the four path early on in the turn, tipped back down to the three path turning for home before altering
back out to be four wide at the three sixteenths pole, chased the top pair through midstretch, gained late as an outer LEAD ME grinded alongside, bid for
place along with that foe at the wire, and prevailed in the tight photo. LEAD ME broke slowly but avoided severe trouble by doing so, raced far back in the
three path before swinging six wide entering the lane, then stayed on willingly after floating seven wide in upper stretch, grinded away late to bid for place at
the wire, but missed. PINEAPPLE ALLEY veered inwardly and squarely bumped a foe at the start, pressed the pace two wide, bid entering the lane, cleared
in upper stretch, drifted out slightly at the furlong grounds as RUN NATALIE RUN inched closer, but tired while shifting back in at the sixteenth pole, gave
way to that foe, and got nailed on the wire by a pair of foes for place. SHESABEAUTYDANCER broke outwardly and bothered a foe at the start, tracked
three wide, shifted to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a rally, wandered about before flopping back to her left lead leaving the furlong grounds, and
weakened. EAGLEOVERTHEMOON broke outwardly and solidly bumped a foe at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, shifted six wide in upper stretch,
but failed to factor after getting outkicked at the furlong grounds. CHEAPSKATE DIVA set the pace along the inside, but was headed in upper stretch, and
weakened through the final furlong. CANDY'S PRIDE was sandwiched between horses at the start when her outer and inner foes both broke into her, then
raced off of the pace along the inside in the two path, and failed to factor. HIGH VALUE TARGET was bumped and bothered by an inner foe at the start,
then failed to make an impact. EASY ACES hopped at the start while breaking multiple lengths slowly, and was outrun. LOVE THAT STAR laid off of the
pace three wide, faded in the five path around the turn, then resisted rider correction from bearing out turning for home, tossed her head rankly in the
process, and trailed through the lane.

XAVEY DAVE stalked in the four path, tucked to the two path at the half mile pole, waited patiently in the pocket around the far turn, shot through a large
opening inside of the drifting leader at the quarter pole, and took charge in upper stretch. VERSTAPPEN saved ground off of the pace, came into the lane in
the three path, tipped to the five path at the furlong grounds, rallied between horses in the late stages, and reached place approaching the wire. GUNTOWN
settled off of the pace two wide, rated in the three to four path around the far turn, split rivals four wide in upper stretch while commencing a gain, shifted out
to the six path in midstretch, rallied outside of VERSTAPPEN through the final furlong, but was fended off by that foe for place late. STITCHED set the pace
in the two path, then inside of a prompting rival down the backstretch and around the far turn, drifted out to the five path entering the lane, but allowed ample
racing room for an inner XAVEY DAVE in the process, quickly proved no match for him passing the quarter pole, sustained place into the final furlong while
hanging on his left lead, but faltered late. BRIT'S WIT took mild bumps between horses at the start, took the first turn in the three path at the rear, saved
ground far back around the far turn, improved inside of rivals in upper stretch, chased along the rail to gain show in midstretch, but was outkicked for that
position in the final sixteenth. TIZ OF THEE stalked along the inside, steadied approaching the backstretch when pulling inside of the leader, shifted out
soon after, split foes approaching the five furlong grounds to vie two wide from the three path around the far turn, but was herded to the six path entering the
lane, and weakened. TUANIS tracked from midpack in the two path, tugged while a bit keen approaching the backstretch, then took the far turn in the three
path before swinging to the seven path entering the lane, but was outkicked by inner rivals in upper stretch, and failed to factor. CREME DE BALI raced in
midpack in the three path, tracked in the five path while outside of foes around the far turn, but weakened while being floated to the eight path entering the
lane. HOLY CITY pressed the leader from the three path, allowed an inner foe to press on at the five furlong pole, stalked from the four path into and around
the far turn, then weakened in the six path in upper stretch. ZULTAN resisted being wrangled back to the rear early on, and got outrun.

Footnotes
AGGIE DOCTOR sped clear, widened around the turn, and lasted safely. LA FEME JOLIE stalked two wide from the three path, and was making up ground
on the clear leader late, but was only second best. SUGAR STAR laid off of the pace in the two path, and moved up between horses in midstretch to claim
show leaving the furlong grounds. ASHLEY'S GIRL saved ground far back, then moved up between horses late. ANGELA'S CELERITY laid far back in the
four path, and moved up between horses late. ANSLIE'S GUMDROP tracked from midpack three wide, swung five wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid.
TWO PUNCH FIST chased along the inside, but tired through the final furlong. SADIE'S RANSOM tracked three wide while in the four path, then tired
between horses leaving the furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead. MON DANSEUR took the turn in the five path while off of the pace, fanned to the
seven path entering the lane, and faded. I'M A CUSTOM TO IT failed to factor. WHEELS LIKE NALA took the turn in the five path far off of the pace, and
was outrun.
