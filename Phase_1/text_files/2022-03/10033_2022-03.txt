Footnotes
LETSGETLUCKY hopped and came away to a slow beginning, angled out widest, gained three wide around the turn, bid three deep into the stretch, fought
four deep in the lane, took over in midstretch and gamely prevailed. CAERULEAN stalked outside a rival, steadied briefly near the half-mile pole and angled
down to the two path, steered to the rail on the turn, rallied up the inside in the drive but was outclosed by the winner. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK dropped
back early, steered to the inside, eased out to the three path around the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch and summoned a mild rally to get up for
third. HAIL FREEDOM stalked off the inside, bid two on the turn, vied three deep between rivals in the stretch, got put in tight past the sixteenth pole and
saved a minor award. MIDNIGHT SOMEWHERE sped to the front and crossed over to the inside, took some light pressure on the turn, vied with rivals in
the two path in the stretch and yielded late. JOE DON LOONEY tracked off the pace early on, crept closer then got blocked behind CAERULEAN near the
seven-sixteenths pole costing him some ground, navigated the turn two then three wide and could not rally. SUZIE QZZ BROTHER chased from inside,
dropped back around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SCREAM AND SHOUT hustled to the front from inside, set the pace under pressure from KEEP YOUR COIL, dueled with that rival on the turn, inched
ahead leaving the turn, held a short lead into the furlong grounds, then drew clear past the eight pole and inched away. KEEP YOUR COIL prompted the
pace from outside, dueled around the turn, kept the pressure on to the furlong marker, could not match the winner late and held the place. CHROME OF
OUR OWN broke out and bumped rival, settled early and moved inside, angled out leaving the turn, came four wide into the stretch and finished well to earn
the show honors. SEASON TO REMEMBER got bumped from inside at the start, asked by the rider early chasing the top pair, went three wide around the
turn and flattened in the lane. RUTHIES RACER chased between early then off the rail, navigated the turn three then four wide and weakened. WARREN'S
MEMORABLE broke a step slow and was bothered shortly after the start, rounded the turn three wide and failed to rally. FLAG SALUTE broke head high to
come away a step slow, raced outside a pair of rivals early then wide into the turn, came four to five wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN LEGEND broke a step slow from inside then was hustled to a forward position in the two path, moved up to apply pressure on the
backstretch, dueled around the far turn, took over and inched ahead in upper stretch, then cleared PERFECTO AMOR and drew away. PERFECTO AMOR
cleared then crossed over to the inside, rated in the early going, pressured from outside in the middle stages, dueled with MONGOLIAN LEGEND around
the far turn, lost command and fought back to the eighth pole, could not keep up in the late stages but stayed on to secure the place. GRANADA FLAVOR
stalked the pace inside, angled three wide on the far turn and kept on through the final furlong. MONGOL ALTAI rounded the first turn three wide, stalked
between foes to the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. ME MACHO got shuffled between rivals before the first turn, angled out and
went four wide around the bend, tracked three deep up the backstretch, came five wide into the stretch and had little left.

Footnotes
BRAVESTONE showed early speed and dueled around the first turn, lost command and chased JUST ABOUT ENOUGH up the backstretch, bid outside
that rival on the far turn, took the lead at the top of the stretch, cleared at the eighth pole and drew away. JUST ABOUT ENOUGH raced four deep into the
first turn, got bumped early on the bend and forced out to the five path, hustled to the front around the bend, cleared up the backstretch and moved to the
inside, headed by rival at the quarter pole, relinquished command, drifted out in the lane and held second. DARK MARCUS got bumped while three deep
early on the first turn, drifted out a bit around the bend, drifted again at the nine-sixteenths pole, went two wide into the far turn, angled out and exited the
turn four wide, then finished evenly in the final furlong. OVER REGULATED bumped between early on the first turn, checked behind rival at the
nine-sixteenths pole, went two then three wide on the far turn, tipped out in the lane and kept on for a minor award. ITS BIG unhurried and moved inside,
steered out on the backstretch, rounded the far turn three wide, came out in the lane and failed to threaten. SIPPIN N KISSIN settled inside, checked off
heels at the three-eighths pole, remained inside to the stretch and could not rally. EREBUS bobbled at the start but recovered quickly and went up to duel
on the first turn, lost command and dropped back a bit to chase the leader in the middle stages, entered the lane two wide and weakened. COOL ACCLAIM
was rank into the first turn and bumped rival, continued to be hard to ride around the bend, settled on the backstretch and could not rally. STEMWINDER off
slow to begin, moved to the inside, steered out and went four wide on the second bend and never got involved.

Footnotes
MUSICA pressed early from inside then moved up to duel for command, took a short lead early on the turn, shook free with a quarter mile left to run and
continued clear under a drive to the wire. KIRSTENBOSCH came away slow, trailed early, saved ground through the turn, rallied along the fence and gained
the place. SECRET FIX broke well then took a stalking position, traveled along the rail into the turn, angled out and chased three wide into the stretch,
closest in pursuit into the furlong grounds but could not find the needed late kick. L BEE sat off the pace early on, entered the stretch two to three wide,
moved out and failed to threaten. MARTINI MISCHIEF took control early under a hold, dueled outside MUSICA into and around the turn, lost contact with
that rival at the quarter pole and tired in the lane. AMERICAN HEIGHTS off alertly from outside, showed speed three deep, chased the top pair leaving the
backstretch, went four to five wide into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
COMMANDER KHAI was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, swept by SWISS SWOO (IRE) at the quarter pole, led clear into the final sixteenth and held
over CHERUBIC FACTOR in the closing moments. CHERUBIC FACTOR tracked the pace along the rail into the turn, came two wide into the stretch, rallied
from outside and was gaining to the wire. MY SUMMER DREAM stumbled leaving the gate, sat off the pace early on, raced along the rail then two wide into
the stretch, finished willingly in the furlong grounds and held the show. GENERAL MATHIS raced well off the pace up the backstretch, traveled along the rail
into the turn, tipped out and was put in a bit tight when trying to go between runners at the five-sixteenths pole, exited the turn three wide and closed late to
miss the show. BIG SCOTT DADDY broke a bit slow and was coaxed early, went two wide into the turn, got moved out to the three path then angled in at
the quarter pole and failed to menace. SWISS SWOO (IRE) sped clear and crossed over, moved to the rail on the turn, offered no resistance to
COMMANDER KHAI and was overtaken at the quarter pole, then faded down the lane. WEARENOTBADPEOPLE broke slow, lagged behind early, saved
ground through the turn and was never a factor. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) raced in range up the backstretch, weakened two to three wide around the turn
and tired in the lane.

MOOSE MITCHELL stumbled at the start, recovered quickly and challenged for command three deep, dueled with WHAT IN BLAZES past the
five-sixteenths pole, inched ahead in upper stretch, had the rider lose his whip at the eighth pole and drew clear nearing the wire. WHAT IN BLAZES vied
between rivals, dueled past the five-sixteenths pole, fought back into the furlong grounds but was bested by the winner. QUICK BUCK attended the pace
four deep to the turn, chased rivals three to four wide past the three-eighths pole, got bumped entering the stretch and kept on to gain the show. FRANKLIN
ONE STAR broke a step slow, went up to vie from inside, battled on the turn then got put in tight at the five-sixteenths pole, chased the top pair leaving the
turn, drifted out and bumped rival into the stretch and flattened. BIG PAPA STEVE came out early on the backstretch, chased the top quartet four wide into
the turn, moved in a bit then came four wide into the lane and made no impact.

Footnotes
ELEUTHERA stumbled and bumped with outside rival at the start, tracked just out of range on the inside, went two wide into the lane, tipped out in the
stretch, rallied outside the top pair with a furlong to go and drew clear. RHEA MOON (IRE) broke slow, pulled early, went between foes on the first turn,
checked off heels at the five-eighths pole, trailed into the far turn, split foes at the five-sixteenths pole, angled out leaving the bend, closed fast and gained
second. ANNIE'S SONG (IRE) broke alertly from inside, rated on the front end then took pressure at the half-mile pole, carried a short lead to the furlong
marker, lost the lead in midstretch and got edged for the place. GRANOLA GIRL raced up close in the two path, applied pressure at the half-mile pole,
challenged to the eighth pole and lacked the needed late punch in the final sixteenth. SUNROOF broke a step slow, traveled two wide into the first turn then
moved inside, cut the corner into the stretch, moved out in the lane and showed late effort in the final furlong. DUVET DAY (IRE) went three then two wide
on the first turn, entered the second bend between rivals, got crowded and steadied in upper stretch and failed to menace. ROCK THE BOURBON stumbled
leaving the gate but recovered quickly, went four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path around the bend, traveled in mid-pack outside a rival up the
backstretch, continued two wide to the stretch and lacked a rally. MIDNIGHT SILENCE broke a bit slow and was rank in the beginning, traveled four then
three wide on the first turn, went three deep into the second bend while near the back of the pack, stayed three wide to the stretch and was not a factor.
SQUILLIONS broke slow, got bumped and was forced to steady at the start, became rank prior to the first turn, pulled at the five-eighths pole, saved ground
through the far turn and came up empty.
