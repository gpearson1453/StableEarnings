Footnotes
BAYOU BELLE prompted the pace two wide, took over near the sixteenth pole and dug in inside of foes. CURRENT SITUATION tracked the pace three
wide, rallied between foes and just missed. PANOTTI was off a bit slow and in tight just after, raced well back three wide around the first turn, made
progress outside down the backstretch, continued three wide around the far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and rallied widest. APPOINTED set the
pace along the rail to the sixteenth pole and weakened. STARSHIP MALLOMAR raced off the pace two wide early, saved ground around the far turn,
advanced inside in upper stretch and flattened out in the final sixteenth. UPTOWN QUEEN failed to menace while racing three and four wide. MORNING
COLORS was extremely rank while up close inside around the first turn, settled briefly down the backstretch, became quite hard to handle again around the
far turn, was briefly settled and urged nearing the lane then was hard held while trying to get out through the stretch.

Footnotes
SUPER LUNAR was never far back, advanced while shifting out three wide approaching the stretch, rallied determinedly to catch SACRED SUNDAY from
outside in deep stretch, and held DREAMING OF AUDREY safe in the final yards. DREAMING OF AUDREY saved ground near the back early, angled out
for clearance leaving the turn, rallied on the far outside and narrowly missed. SACRED SUNDAY pressed the pace two wide, took over through midstretch,
then yielded late inside the top two. PATTI D raced in the second flight two to three wide to the stretch, and gained mildly for the last major share. LENA
THE LION had a ground-saving trip, and lacked the needed bid. WORKINONBEINSINGLE set the pace inside, and yielded in upper stretch. CAJUN SPICE
failed to reach contention. ROSY APPLE raced three to four wide around the turn, and tired after three furlongs.

Footnotes
KARLA SOFIA lost some footing at the start, prompted and advanced to a slim lead, raced two wide under pressure from LONDON LADY into the turn,
repelled bid past the three-eighths pole and edged away on top, prompted turning for home, responded willingly, opened up to a clear lead and finished
going away under steady encouragement. LONDON LADY hustled up out of the gate and pressed the early pace, could not remain in touch with eventual
winner past the three eighths pole but stayed on determinedly and held place. WITH LIBERTY raced in striking distance and steadied along the rail through
early stages, tipped out and chased three wide around the turn, kept on with response through the lane and cleared the rest. GRANDMA'S PUDDING raced
four wide mid-pack not far back in early stages, flattened off the top trio upon entering the turn and continued to tire in the lane. JAN'S GIRL took a solid
bump at the start, was ridden three wide around the turn and failed to move into contention. RACING COLORS broke in and bumped hard with rival at the
start, raced off the early pace, came four wide into the lane and never threatened. HOTTER THAN JULY raced wide in the back, tucked inside around the
turn and failed to respond.

GRACEFUL KITTEN dueled inside a foe in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch and held firm under left-handed urging. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE raced
off the pace inside down the backstretch, angled out early on the turn, advanced four to five wide around the bend and rallied through the lane. SCOTTY
BROWN stalked the pace four wide, lacked the need rally but churned on to hold the show. LEASE trailed while racing five to six wide around the turn and
never threatened. LEAGUE OF SHADOWS was in range inside and weakened in the lane. POPPY'S PRIDE dueled outside of the winner in the three path
and tired in the drive.

SPUNTACULAR set the pace in the two-path, settled into the stretch with a clear advantage, and had enough to hold on while drifting out a bit late.
RUSSIAN TO WIN chased after SPUNTACULAR around the turn and into the stretch, stayed on task and was closing in from outside in the final yards.
GRAN ANDREWS was unhurried early, and rallied mildly on the rail while remaining on his left lead. VISION BOARD was outrun early, fanned five wide
coming off the turn, and gained some ground without threatening. JUST SO YA KNOW broke slowly and trailed early inside, swung six wide approaching
the stretch, and improved without becoming a factor. BEASTFROMTHEEAST raced two to three wide, and was finished after six furlongs. FISHING FOR
FUN faltered after six furlongs in the four-path. ACT OF VALOR saved ground up close early, and was through soon after going a half-mile.

Footnotes
LIDO KEY raced two wide in range around the first turn and settled nicely just off the early pace, made a move between rivals mid-way around the turn then
headed in pursuit of MISS DELICIOUS, was set down three wide at the head of the lane, stayed on determinedly and edged ahead in deep stretch. MISS
DELICIOUS sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm over pursuers around the far turn, roused for more approaching the
upper stretch, held clear a furlong out then got overtaken late. SHORT CIRCUIT was not too far off the early pace while settled inside, angled out three wide
late on the far turn and hustled along into the upper stretch, sustained a steady bid through the lane and secured a share. IN A SPIN angled to the inside
heading into the first turn and tracked the pace up the backstretch, was ridden along the inside around the far turn, tipped a path wider for the drive and
flattened out. ACT LIKE ARTIE was allowed to settle out of the gate and remained reserved up the backstretch, hustled up along the rail around the far turn,
showed brief interest in the upper stretch then gave way. SHEA ON A MISSION stalked two wide through early stages, failed to progress under pressure
around the far turn and offered no late rally. LUCKY LATKES stalked three wide up the backstretch, failed to advance when called upon mid-way around the
far turn and retreated in the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

TUCK when that foe reached near even terms approaching the quarter pole, clung to the lead inside of that foe through the stretch and held firm. FRIAR
TUCK stalked the pace three wide, reached near even terms nearing the quarter pole, battled outside of the winner through the stretch and between rivals
late but could never get by. DEMOCRACY was off slowly, raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and rallied outside. SARAWAT was
outrun while racing three wide. TUWAIM was off a bit slow, advanced inside to duel inside of the winner for a half then retreated.

Footnotes
UNPRECEDENTED sped clear early, showed the way in the two-path around the turn, responded well through the lane and remained in command.
RECONFIGURE raced four wide improving position around the turn, rallied through the stretch unable to reach the winner, but was clearly second best.
INDY LYON was outsprinted early inside, came four wide off the turn, rallied mildly and was just up for the show. CUY pursued the pacesetter four then
three wide around the turn, and lacked a solid closing response. HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE gave chase between horses for three-eighths of a mile, and
faded. THE CONNECTOR chased inside to the stretch, and weakened. KASIM was between horses among a quartet pursuing UNPRECEDENTED early,
and tired after three furlongs.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE LADY stalked the pace three wide up the backstretch, advanced and briefly matched strides before taking the lead late on the far turn, came
under a drive three wide into the upper stretch, turned back the bid from CIDER APPLE in the lane and held clear. CIDER APPLE (GB) raced off the early
pace, circled up closer five wide late on the far turn, came in a couple paths while moving up approaching in the upper stretch, loomed a threat to rival but
could not reach and settled for second best. MAYBE LATER raced near midpack, moved up close three wide late on the far turn, angled inside in the upper
stretch and stayed on to secure show. APPLECROSS (IRE) settled off the early pace, began to make a move two to three wide mdi-way through the far
turn, was forced to steady, lost momentum, shifted out wider at the head of the lane and improved position. SOUPER ALL STAR rated off the early pace,
showed response four wide around the far turn, gained closer contention then flattened in the final furlong. PASSION PLUS secured inside position around
the first turn, settled near midpack saving ground, was ridden along two to three wide around the far turn and failed to move on. SILKY WARRIOR (IRE)
broke awkwardly at the start, raced in the back and passed tiring foes in the lane. HIGH SPEED STEF tracked in contention up the backstretch, remained in
range through the final turn then gave way. BLUE TIMES was briefly edgy in the gate, raced up close behind the pacesetter, briefly vied with the winner
around the final turn then came up empty. THAT'S MY BABY stalked inside up the backstretch and faded around the final turn. GATHER AS YOU GO set
the pace through the backstretch, got collared mid-way through the final turn and dropped back.
