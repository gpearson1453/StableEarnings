Footnotes
RATIONAL CHOICE prompted the pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader while along the rail on the turn, was shaken up inside the five-sixteenths,
shifted three wide approaching the quarter-pole, rallied to the lead just inside the three-sixteenths, fought outside of the runner-up into the final furlong,
disposed of that foe under the crop into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand-ride to the wire while best. AMERICAN LAW went to the front,
remained well out in the track leaving the chute, dropped in after going outside windswept debris on the track near the three-quarter-pole, was well rated
while showing the way, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch, fought with the
winner until near the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while well clear for the place. WRITEITONTHEICE was hustled from the gate, moved out to avoid
debris near the three-quarter pole, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path through the turn and tired but was clear for the show.
DREAMPOINT angled in while urged along well off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. NOTHINGTOSEEHERE was slowest into
stride then urged along at the rear, went three wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
CARBON coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped out five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive steadily gaining to take command seventy yards from home, then inched away to the finish. ROYAL CURRENCY coaxed from the start, raced
forwardly placed three paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn advancing to prompt the leader latching on
three furlongs from home, remained patiently handled until set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, seized command straightened away, inched away
under a drive to the eighth pole, then dug in under threat and was caught seventy yards from the finish while clear for the place honors. DARN THAT SONG
broke out at the start brushing BUNTY WINDEMERE, chased inside early on and was placed in a bit tight by TWIST JUST RIGHT with five furlongs to go,
tipped to the two path at the half mile pole before chasing two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide at the
head of the stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. SEE ME NOW broke in at the start bumping SUCCULENT in concert with TWIST JUST RIGHT
and was hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and kept on to the
finish. TWIST JUST RIGHT broke out at the start bumping SUCCULENT in tandem with SEE ME NOW and came under hustling, chased briefly just off the
inside before placing DARN THAT SONG briefly in tight to her inside before taking over the rail in front of that rival five furlongs from home, came under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. BUNTY WINDERMERE got brushed at the start by DARN THAT
SONG, who broke out a step, came under hustling and showed the way through swift splits along the inside, came under increasing pressure through the
turn and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths in response as ROYAL CURRENCY advanced outside, swung three wide at the top of the stretch under
threat, yielded the front straightened away, and tired through to the finish. SUCCULENT got bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way and
was lightly and briefly taken hold of conceding three lengths to the front, chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing
near the midway point on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

MACHO BOY brushed with a foe at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path through the turn, gained while driven five wide into the
stretch, battled outside of BROCKMONINOFF into the final furlong, took the lead shortly thereafter and prevailed under strong urging. TRUEBELIEVE
brushed with a foe at the start, was coaxed along just off the pace, dropped back three then two wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive
while near the rail, chased in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. BROCKMONINOFF broke very fast and went straight to the front, showed the
way down the backstretch, vied inside the winner in the two path on the turn, was roused for more outside the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final
furlong then was overtaken while well clear for the show. IRISH GIANT was hustled from the start then ridden along on the outside, went three wide on the
turn and lacked the needed response while able to get the last spot in the superfecta. WILD UNION was hustled from the start then urged along at the rear,
went two then three wide on the turn and was no factor. OUR AMERICAN STAR broke a bit slow, quickly angled out at the rear, was urged along on the
outside, went five wide on the turn and failed to respond. RUNNING VIOLENCE was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and also failed to
respond.

CHARGER four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took over command from the embattled duelers swinging four wide
into upper stretch under threat to the outside, dug in under challenge from QUICKFLASH through the stretch to the sixteenth marker before repelling that
rival to inch away in the late stages. QUICKFLASH five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, bid five wide into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive latched on the top one challenging through to the sixteenth marker, then got rebuffed in the late stages while clear for the place honors.
TOUGH TICKETS hustled from the gate, dueled from the two path with EXALTED CHARM to his outside, tucked inside through the turn and came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and was displaced from the front in tandem with his main pace rival by the top one, then
kept on under a drive to preserve the show honors. EXALTED CHARM hustled from the start, dueled three then two wide with the aforementioned foe to his
inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got overtaken in concert with his main pace foe spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. JERUSALEM GATES hesitated at the start and brushed the near side stall under encouragement conceding five to six lengths
to the front before settling into stride, chased three then two wide detached at the tail of the field, came under prolonged urging from the half mile pole,
angled four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. D'VINICRIS chased six then five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered six wide for
home and tired. BREAKING STONES broke in at the start and came under coaxing, chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside for home and tired.

Footnotes
CATHEDRAL BEACH was away fast, pressed the pace on the outside under urging, drew even with the leader in the two path on the turn, gained the lead
at the five-sixteenths, led three wide into the stretch under one pop of a right-handed crop, switched to a left-handed crop while under threat from the
runner-up inside the three-sixteenths then lost the advantage, swapped back to a right-handed whip inside the furlong marker, battled gamely to the wire
and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. EFFICIENCY was bumped hard at the start, settled off the pace, moved closer with five furlongs to run, saved
ground while drafting behind the leader on the turn, was given his cue near the five-sixteenths, gained to make a bid between foes in the two path at the
three-sixteenths, took a narrow advantage outside the furlong marker, dueled inside of the winner under a right-handed crop to the wire and was denied
while well clear for the place. SUGAR GRAY LEONARD broke a step slow then was hustled, chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn,
was driven four wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. RHUMJAR veered in at the start, moved
up to take the lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage at the five-sixteenths, dropped back in
upper stretch and tired. TORPEDO RUN moved out inside the three-quarter pole, was rated on the outside, went three to four wide under urging on the turn,
was driven five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. JOE BRRRR broke in then bumped hard with a foe then dropped back, quickly fell well behind and
was pulled up then walked off.

Footnotes
AWESOME AARON broke in at the start bumping SHARPOON into UNION LIGHTS, raced three to four wide in closest aim of the leader before latching on
half a mile from home, steadily got on near even terms with seven-sixteenths to go and dueled from the three path through the turn widening away from the
rest of the field as a pair before swinging four to five wide into upper stretch when let out for the drive, knocked heads gamely through to the finish trading a
bump at the wire and just got the bob on the line. CHECK THAT CHIP broke out at the start and was corrected coming under hustling to show the way along
the inside early on safely in front, had the aforementioned foe advance outside and came under light coaxing half a mile from home, got engaged in head to
head combat from the seven-sixteenths urged along shaking away strongly from the rest of the field, swung three wide into upper stretch, continued the
head to head fracas through the length of the stretch fighting on gamely and clinging to the slightest advantage before trading a bump at the finish and
getting nailed by a nod of the head. UNION LIGHTS reluctant to load prior to the start, got bumped at the start by SHARPOON due to pressure from
AWESOME AARON breaking inwards, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and was
along for the show honors isolated between the top pair and the rest of the field. SHARPOON stumbled at the start and was bumped by AWESOME
AARON into UNUON LIGHTS, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled to spin just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.
LET FREEDOM SPRING hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn getting placed to coaxing midway, took the
inside route into upper stretch and faltered. MAGIC MINER chased just off the inside, came under brief light coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped out four to
five wide into upper stretch well behind and eased up, then got pulled up near the eighth pole and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
LITTLE MENACE pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead into upper stretch, kicked clear coming to the furlong
marker and proved best under a solid hand-ride to the wire. PIONEER SPIRIT broke out at the start, quickly angled to the outside, tracked the pace down
the backstretch, chased in the four path around the turn, came five wide into the stretch and earned the place while no match for the winner. ITS ALL
RELEVANT went to the front, showed the way under some pressure, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and
tired but was clear for the show. MY FIRST GRAMMY was carried out early then moved in around the seven-eighths pole, settled off the pace under some
restraint, was roused in the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed response.
TWO THIRTY FIVE settled towards the back, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was roused while saving ground on the turn, had the rider lose his crop
outside the five-sixteenths pole and came up empty.

and swung four wide into upper stretch, held safely clear getting placed to light coaxing just outside the eighth pole, the rider keeping his crop tucked to the
