Footnotes
MUWAAN MAT saved ground in reach of the leaders to move closer through the far turn, bid along the rail as the field bunched turning into the stretch,
dueled inside MOONFIELD and narrowly edged that one on the wire. MOONFIELD was just off the early leaders inside, angled three wide nearing the far
turn to bid into the lane, dueled the winner to the wire and just missed. RYRYSWEETIE contested the pace outside DIVA'S DIVA to the far turn, continued
on between rivals as the field bunched turning for home then came up empty late. HOBBS HOPE stalked the early leaders outside, came five wide into the
lane and could not produce the needed late rally. PRINCESS SHAKIRA failed to mount a serious bid three wide. DIVA'S DIVA contested the pace inside
RYRYSWEETIE to the far turn and weakened into the lane.

MISS OCEAN EXPRESS settled outside in reach of the pace, moved four and five wide on the far turn then continued to rally through the lane and went
clear late. STELLA MARIE saved ground and made a mild late run through the lane to gain the place. ALWAYS A TIZ moved to a clear lead early, made the
running to upper stretch and had nothing left late. JUSTATAPIN stalked the pace in reach two or three wide but lacked a final closing bid. CHAMPAGNE
BLING trailed three or four wide and moved up late going six wide into the lane. JOE G'S PAYBACK was in reach three or four wide and failed to mount a
bid. VEGAN GOES BEST tracked the leader three wide and weakened in the lane.

CHARM AND SARCASM was caught in tight between rivals in the opening furlong, rallied three to four wide in the far turn to bid turning for home and edged
clear under steady handling. GOVENESS SHEILA was on the pace inside EUROROPER to edge clear into the far turn, resisted the winner but could not go
with that one late. SWEET CAPRI settled off the early pace and made a mild late run three wide. D L'S GIRL saved ground, angled out into the lane but
lacked a late rally. SPILLED PERFUME saved ground and moved up through the lane while not a threat. HEAVENS PRINCESS saved ground and lacked a
rally. MOON LOVIN weakened four wide. EUROROPER forced the pae outside GOVENESS SHEILA to late backstretch and tired. JOEL'S GIRL was four
and five wide in the first turn and was always back.
