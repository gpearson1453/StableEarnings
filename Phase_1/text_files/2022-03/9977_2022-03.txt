Footnotes
LOVE'S MISERY broke out then was bumped lightly in the hindquarters, established a good position just off the pace, tipped out a path late on the
backstretch, ranged up in the two path to make a bid with three furlongs to run, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, was headed by the runner-up in
upper stretch, dueled gamely inside that foe in the final furlong, regained the lead inside the sixteenth-pole and determinedly prevailed under strong
handling. MY DELICIOUS came outward while breaking in front, pressed the pace on the inside of the leader, dropped just off the pace with a half-mile to
run, was kept to the inside and not allowed an option to get off the rail when the winner moved up outside that one early on the turn, drafted inside while
behind the pacesetter at the three-eighths, was roused around the five-sixteenths then shifted three wide, gained to take a short lead under a drive in upper
stretch, dueled outside of the winner in the final furlong, lost the advantage inside the sixteenth-pole and was denied while far clear for the place. MY
LITTLE LULU bumped with foes at the start, went to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner
outside the quarter-pole, dropped back into upper stretch and tired but was clear for the show. ROMA CARPE bumped lightly with an opponent while off a
step slow, was coaxed along at the rear on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, shifted from four to six wide on the turn, bumped twice with
LONDON GOLD inside the three-eighths and failed to respond. LONDON GOLD broke out then made contact with foes on both sides, settled towards the
back, moved closer late on the backstretch, shifted from three to five wide on the turn, bumped twice with ROMA CARPE inside the three-eighths, dropped
to the four path into upper stretch then drifted further in, had the rider lost his crop into the final furlong and was no factor. BAD BRETH was hustled after
breaking well, chased the pace on the outside, dropped back quickly while three then four wide on the turn, floated seven wide into upper stretch and
faltered.

Footnotes
STENCIL established a good position just off the pace, passed the half-mile pole under snug restraint, drafted inside while still under restraint on the turn,
slipped through inside the pacesetter to take the advantage while asked outside the quarter-pole, kicked clear into upper stretch, drew away under the crop
to the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride to the wire while much the best. CALIBOGUE SOUND settled off the pace, saved ground on the
turn, skimmed the rail while inside of a foe into the stretch and got up for the place while no threat to the winner. MEBS WEB settled on the outside, chased
four wide through the turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop and proved no match for the winner then lost the place but was clear for the show.
AWESOMENEWYEAR came outward at the start, angled in at the rear then dropped well behind the rest of the field, went two then three wide on the turn,
came five wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. INVESTMENT GRADE broke very fast, showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the
turn in the two path, lost the lead to the winner outside the quarter-pole and tired. POLISHED GEM was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the
outside then in the three path on the turn, floated five wide while dropping back into upper stretch and capitulated. CHARLOTTE WEBLEY settled off the
pace, was roused in the two path on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
WINTER POOL was hustled from the gate, traveled around the first turn in the three path, settled comfortably on the outside, ranged up three wide on the
far turn, took the lead inside the five-sixteenths then was asked outside the quarter-pole, kicked clear into the stretch, drew away under the crop to just
before the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. JOHNNYPUMP dropped back in the early going, saved ground around the first turn,
settled at the rear, was urged along passing the five-eighths, raced in the two path early on the far turn, moved to three then four wide while gaining into
striking range late on that bend, pursued the winner under a drive into upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. KING KUMBALAY went
around the first turn in the three to four path, prompted the pace on the outside, took the lead in the two path outside the three-eighths, was asked under
threat around the five-sixteenths then lost the advantage to the winner, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened but held the show. THREE JOKERS
was hustled to the front, set the pace on the inside with company to his outside, lost the lead while along the rail outside the three-eighths and tired. SON
OF AN EX went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the back on the outside, was urged along before the nine-sixteenths, traveled four wide on the far
turn and failed to respond. MY FIRST GRAMMY settled while saving ground, dropped back approaching the half-mile pole and faltered.

HOW LUCKY just off the pace five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn advancing on the front to take
command just inside the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in dueling with SUDDEN IMPULSE through to the sixteenth marker,
then edged clear to the finish kept busy to the wire. SUDDEN IMPULSE five paths off the inside in aim of the front, tucked three wide through the turn
advancing in tandem with the aforementioned foe on the leader coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in
dueling to the sixteenth pole before being shaken off late while well clear of the rest and along second best. GAGLIANO coaxed from the gate, raced six
paths off the inside down the backstretch running isolated between foes quartet up front and the pair well behind, tucked three then two wide through the
turn under coaxing from the half mile pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors in the final furlong.
SUMMARY JUDGMENT hustled from the start, showed the way lightly coaxed along in the two path under some pressure from INCONTROVERTIBLE to
the outside, came under increased pressure midway on the turn, yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go and spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
then tired in the drive. INCONTROVERTIBLE prompted the pace four paths off the inside down the backstretch, began to fade when coaxed along at the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. LUZ chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and made no impact being eased through the final furlong to the finish. LUCKY SITKA hustled
from the gate and coming under the whip to the right side, chased four wide from near the rear of the field, tucked to the two path through the turn, went four
wide into upper stretch, was unable to make an impact and was eased through to the final eighth to the wire.

DEALING JUSTICE was hustled from the gate, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, was roused
for more outside the quarter-pole then shook clear, responded well when put to a left-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a right-handed crop inside
the furlong marker and proved best under vigorous handling. SHESALITTLE EDGY contested the pace on the outside, was urged along in the two path on
the turn, lost touch with the winner into upper stretch, chased that opponent to the wire and was outfinished but narrowly earned the place. ROSSA
VELOCE showed early speed then moved out while chasing around the five-eighths, pursued the leader in the three path around the turn, chased that foe
under a drive in the stretch and narrowly missed the place while clear for the show. TARA'S TALENT broke in then bobbled slightly, was urged along on the
outside, went four wide on the turn and lacked the needed kick then brushed with a foe nearing the wire. ROYAL MEGHAN was last to commence, raced
towards the rear under strong urging, rounded the turn from the inside to the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed
response then brushed with a rival nearing the wire. ELOQUENT SPEAKER was hustled from the start, climbed into kickback after being beaten to the front,
angled to the outside outside the five-eighths then was hard ridden, chased four wide around the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SICILIA MIKE brushed at the start by GOLANI BRIGADE, who recovered outwards from a bobble, chased four wide down the backstretch and through the
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths while steadily advancing on the front, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched
on to the outside of the leader a furlong out, took over command with a sixteenth to go and inched away in the late stages to prevail. GOLANI BRIGADE
bobbled at the break recovering outwards to brush with the aforementioned foe, showed the way in hand along the inside down the backstretch and then
just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared
at the sixteenth pole and was along safe for the place honors. GANDY DANCING coaxed from the start, chased along the inside patiently handled until
roused angled three wide into upper stretch, then kept on to secure the show honors. BAD GUY chased four to five wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. O SHEA CAN U SEE five paths off the inside briefly early on, tucked to the two
path and gave chase from the tail of the field, came under coaxing two to three wide at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made
no impact. TRUE GOLD coaxed from the gate, chased three wide in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, cornered
three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. DEVIOUS MO coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside in range of the front coming under prolonged
coaxing with half a mile to run, spun two to three wide into upper stretch in retreat and faltered in the drive.
