in to prevail. CHA CHING CHARLIE exchanged some bumps at the start, dueled outside two to three wide, had a neck in front in upper- to mid-stretch,
drifted in and bumped a rival near the sixteenth, was outfinished but a game second. ROLLIN IN DIAMONDS chased the dueling leaders in the three path,
failed to rally. FANTASTICALLY FINE was bumped around between rivals at the start, raced outside four wide on the turn and was not a threat. ALVIS
bumped with a rival at the start, shifted in, trailed and failed to menace.

Footnotes
COLOR ME GONE tracked in behind the leaders two to three wide, altered out for room in upper stretch, struck the lead a sixteenth out and won going
away under steady handling. IMA SAINT TOO stalked the leaders, advanced outside leaving the backstretch, pressured four wide on the turn, took a narrow
lead in upper- to mid-stretch but was outfinished. ROAD TO HEAT dueled outside early then contended three wide between runners on the turn, was
outkicked. ESTEEMED settled at the rear, went three to four wide through most of the turn shifting in late on that bend, improved with mild late interest
inside. SMOOTHING IRON dropped back heading to the turn, moved out from three to five wide on that bend coming six deep into upper stretch, failed to
rally. HIT A NOTE was fractious in the gate, bumped at the start, dueled inside a foe but a path removed from the rail, came up empty. WAYLAY broke
outwardly and steadied slightly, shifted in after clearing the gap and moved forward inside, failed to threaten. BULLY RIDE stumbled into a foe and steadied
at the start, switched outside a rival going two wide, was never a threat.

Footnotes
TEQUILA TIME tracked the leaders from inside, moved out midway on the turn to be three wide, had room between rivals in upper stretch, struck the lead
by the sixteenth pole and edged clear. KISS ME D ORO was bumped sideways at the start but quickly recovered to duel outside, went three then four wide
on the turn, had a clear lead in upper stretch but was outkicked and just saved the place. BABO STORM bumped a rival hard at the start, lacked sufficient
early speed chasing three wide on the turn, angled seven deep out of that bend, was flying late but missed the place. FEEL THE BERNING bumped with a
rival at the start, settled off the leaders, moved out from two to five wide advancing on the turn, loomed a threat at the head of the stretch but flattened out.
TROOPER bumped with a foe at the start, lacked early speed, moved out from three to six wide on the turn and was never near enough to threaten.
GALLOPING UNO dueled inside a rival but off the fence, urged along at the five-sixteenths, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
SIDNEY'S HOPE was forwardly-placed, shifted in to the two path entering the turn, came out turning for home, lugged out in late stretch compromising
outside rivals while holding sway. SHANGHAI MIKE bumped into a foe heading up the backstretch then did so again just before entering the turn, tracked
the leaders three wide, angled five wide into upper stretch, was carried out and brushed late. YES ITSA STAR stalked the leaders four wide, moved to
challenge between runners in upper- to mid-stretch, was forced out, brushed a rival and steadied between very late. WILLY TELL HIM settled last but one,
advanced five wide on the turn, swung seven deep into upper stretch and ran on. YOUR ADORABLE brushed a rival at the break, dueled outside going
three wide on the turn, faltered and faded. FABOZZI was brushed at the break, lacked early speed despite mild encouragement, moved in from six to four
wide on the turn, made no bids. LAUNCH LIGHT DREAM raced two wide between runners in the second flight, was bumped early up the backstretch then
again entering the turn and checked about the five-sixteenths. TOMEGA was forwardly-positioned up the backstretch racing inside, checked about the
five-sixteenths as another rival nearby did the same, dropped back significantly and failed to threaten thereafter. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY,
SIDNEY'S HOPE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED THIRD BEHIND YES ITSA STAR FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH.

Footnotes
OUR ISLAND GIRL was bumped lightly at the break, shifted in and advanced three wide to track the leaders, was within striking distance through the turn,
drifted out in mid-stretch then surged late. SHAMEONNATALIE set the early pace from off the inside, went two wide on the turn with challengers inside and
out, drifted out then drifted in through mid-stretch, was outkicked. EVANGELINA WHO bumped a rival at the start, advanced on the turn moving in from five
to three wide, came out six deep at the top of the stretch, gained late to get up for show honors. SHELL GAME was up close early, in contention inside late
on the turn, weakened in the stretch. HOLLYWOOD BOUND broke a bit awkwardly, chased four to five wide, came into upper stretch seven deep and
lacked the needed late kick. CHA CHA TOUCH was carried out a bit heading up the backstretch, angled in early on the turn, saved ground and ran on
evenly. BLUSHING BABE switched out heading up the backstretch quite wide then moved back in two to three deep into the turn, angled eight wide in
upper stretch and failed to menace. MISS RAPPER broke a step slowly, raced off the fence in the two to three path through the turn and was never a threat.
JAZZY RED was within range going four wide on the turn, faltered and faded.

ROBYNS LUCKYLIZARD set the early pace, was pressured after a quarter, edged clear in the two path on the turn, extended the margin into upper stretch
and held under a drive. ALLERGIC TO LOGIC bumped a rival and steadied at the start, switched out and made a swift early move outside, pressured the
leader into the turn, dropped back three wide on that bend, proved no match. COOL AND QUICK was off slowly and bumped at the break, lacked early
speed, went two to three wide on the turn, came out seven wide in upper stretch and got up for show honors late. DADDY HEAT chased just off the leaders,
dropped back four wide on the turn, lost show honors late. OLIVE COUNTY shifted in and tracked inside early, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
EPIC ADVENTURE broke on top but ceded the lead content to stalk, pursued three wide on the turn, dueled through late stretch and got the nod. FIRST
STRING was coaxed forward after the break to take the lead racing a path off the rail, was engaged in upper stretch, dueled late, lost the nod but was game
in defeat. SOULONG exchanged a bump at the start, lacked early speed racing quite wide, moved in to go three to four deep through the turn, got up for
show honors. JUST AWESOME M stalked from between runners four to five wide on the turn, floated out six wide turning for home, kept on in the lane.
TORRIE THE RAPPER exchanged a bump at the start, moved out from two to four wide on the turn going further to be five wide in upper stretch and in
contention for the minor prize but lacked the needed late kick. SWITCHERONIMO tracked inside, failed to rally. SIR AMNESTY chased outside, went five
wide on the turn, tired.

Footnotes
DESTINY WHO broke outwardly, settled mid-pack three to four wide, surged past late. FI FI D'ORO pursued the leader five wide into the turn, edged closer
three wide leaving that bend, exchanged a brush in upper stretch, dueled, won that battle but was outfinished. ARRANGED VOWS was sent clear after the
start racing just off the rail, came out and exchanged some light contact in upper stretch, dueled then weakened. UNBRIDLED DIVA settled into stride last
but one, shifted in from four to two wide on the turn, gained late. FEISTY HALO tracked mid-pack inside, came out three wide early on the turn, angled eight
wide turning for home and ran on mildly. WILEO PROCEED advanced outside rivals five wide on the turn, came into upper stretch seven deep and went
evenly. SOUNDOFME NOTCALLN came out after the break, was in pursuit two to three wide, weakened. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL T settled at the rear, shifted
in to save ground on the turn, ran on mildly. MISS EASYGO was urged from the break, chased two to three wide, gave way. JASMINE BABY broke in the
air and steadied at the start, raced mostly four to five wide, tired.

Footnotes
HALF COURT SAM attended the pace from outside going three wide on the turn, drew away when asked. DANZ AT COLFAX vied inside the winner just off
the rail, was no match but second best. PHANTOMOFTHEOPERE stalked the leading pair, went two to three wide on the turn, was no match. THE LAST
FEAT settled at the rear, went seven wide on the turn, came in through the stretch while improving position. MCMERCELUS broke in the air and slowly,
spotting the field a few lengths then was rushed while shifting in and weaving back out to gain a forward position, chased four to five wide on the turn then
flattened out. PROBATE bobbled then exchanged a bump at the start, raced well back going four to five wide on the turn, was never near enough to
threaten. I'MAGAMBLER switched out early, went three to four wide on the turn racing mid-pack, faded. ILLUMINATE D STORM exchanged a bump at the
start, tracked inside, steadily retreated. FOUR SOCKS WHO failed to threaten after going five to six wide on the turn.
