Footnotes
KING PARKER was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside with THE METAL MAN, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear
margin and was ridden out to be kept to task. MARK YE WELL showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn, could not reach the winner in the
drive but finished with good energy to gain the place. GREAT ULYSSES settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further
into the stretch and rallied late. BLOW MY MIND raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached a contending position and
lacked the needed late response. MAJESTIC CAFE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, gained a striking position and failed
sustain his bid. MOUNTAIN SPIRIT lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. CLUB CHAMP was void of early foot,
raced seven-wide through the turn and was not a threat. LOVER BOY BOB was pinched back at the start, raced six-wide through the turn and did not offer a
bid. THE METAL MAN broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
BODEGA settled off the leaders early, advanced four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a quarter to run, opened a clear margin into the
stretch and drew off. QUINTO SOL raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground through the second turn, waited for racing room nearing the quarter,
slipped through and finished with good courage. BLUES RAPPER was void of early speed, checked nearing the quarter, angled in and out into the stretch
and finished with good energy when clear. COLONEL MIKE raced four-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the second turn
and finished with a belated bid. AUTISM SAVANT settled off the leaders early, moved eight-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. BY
MOONLIGHT dueled for the lead from the inside with THOUGHTS OF GOLD for three-quarters and weakened. FULL VELOCITY chased the leaders from
the inside and six furlongs and weakened. MANCUSO AT THE MIC appeared rank to rate, lagged far back and did not reach contention. THOUGHTS OF
GOLD disputed the pace with BY MOOLIGHT while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. ABANDONED was forwardly placed early,
moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened.
