FI FI D'ORO exchanged a light bump at the start, switched outside the leaders settling in behind heading up the backstretch, moved swiftly outside four wide
on the turn to take command outside the three-eighths pole and quickly edge clear, put to urging in upper stretch, drew off while being kept to the task.
ALLIE R vied inside a rival but off the fence, went two wide into the turn, lugged in past the quarter pole, kept on the chase in upper stretch then yielded.
CORA BELLE settled off the leaders, went three wide on the turn, was along for show but no threat to the top pair. MISSY MIA broke a half step slowly,
raced outside going four to five wide on the turn, improved. SPICEY SECRET vied outside early, dropped back three wide on the turn, came up empty.
YOUNG'UN tracked from inside, faded. CORNERSTONE exchanged a bump at the start, moved well off the inside early then nearer the rail into the turn
before coming back out, tired.

Footnotes
IZA DADDY pressed the pace from between rivals three wide, dueled inside a foe but in the three path on the far turn, drifted out turning for home then
lugged out in mid-stretch, found another gear and repelled that challenger to drive clear. SOUTHERN SUMMER stalked from outside four wide, dueled on
the far turn, was carried out in the stretch still in contention but could not kick on. HEREDITARY broke a half step slowly, settled in the back half of the field
mostly two to three wide, came out in upper stretch and gained mildly. FLICKERING LIGHT set the early tempo inside, dropped back into the far turn,
switched out midway on that bend, failed to rally. DISPUTED moved out two to three wide into the first turn, advanced early up the backstretch, continued
two to four wide on the far turn, failed to get near enough to threaten. A CEE DOO CEE shifted in early on the first turn, dropped back, was not a factor,
tired.

MISS RULES settled mid-pack racing off the fence two to three wide, advanced two to four wide on the far turn, struck the lead at the top of the stretch,
edged clear by mid-stretch and held safe. REALREALGOOD settled at the rear outside a foe two to three wide, continued in this fashion to the far turn,
moved out five deep leaving that bend, gained but too late. SEE YOU AT THE TOP saved ground early on or just off the rail, tipped out three deep heading
up the backstretch, made a swift move three wide to take the lead at the quarter pole but was thereupon challenged, offered no extra. MINNIE ME HA
settled last but one inside, moved out three wide late on the far turn, failed to threaten. BINALLOVERDRINKEN pressed the early pace three to four wide
from outside, led at the nine-sixteenths, continued two to three deep on the far turn and was overtaken by the quarter pole, came up empty. IROQUOIS
HEART set a pressured pace inside a rival but off the fence, faded.

SUNSCREEN was urged from the break, chased from outside going five then four wide on the turn, came out turning for home, was clear in mid-stretch and
held. GOLDEN BAND went four wide through most of the turn moving out six deep late on that bend, came out further still and exchanged numerous light
bumps and brushes through the stretch, got the nod for place. DADDY WHAT IF raced at the rear outside, went five wide through the turn moving out seven
deep late on that bend, was carried out a bit into upper stretch and exchanged several light brushes, missed the place. KRIS WHO set the pace in the clear
racing off the rail, weakened. DESERT DANGER settled off the leaders, raced inside into the turn, angled out nearing the quarter pole, was ten wide in
upper stretch and ran on. AISLE RUNNER chased from between runners four then three wide on the turn, weakened. CHARLIE COMANCH chased the
pace three wide, moved in a bit on the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
OUR IRIS ROSE hopped at the start but quickly sped clear racing two wide, widened into upper stretch, held safe. FLYIN FALYNN switched outside foes
early, settled off the leaders, advanced five to six wide on the turn to reach contention coming to the quarter pole but was only second best. GIRONA settled
between runners, went two to three wide on the turn, found room at the top of the stretch, captured show honors. REVENOOR WOMAN trailed early, moved
outside six to seven wide on the turn and improved. RANEEM exchanged a bump at the break, steadied when in tight early, pursued three to four wide
between runners on the turn, lacked a late kick. BRAVE CINDERELLA saved ground on the turn, faded in the lane. STACI'S RED DRESS exchanged a
bump at the start, pressed the early pace from inside, switched out three deep at the three-eighths, came up empty. BYE BYE JILL veered in early then
straightened out, dropped back four to five wide on the turn and faded.
