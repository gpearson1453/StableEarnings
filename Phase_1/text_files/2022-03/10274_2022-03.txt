Footnotes
AXEL STEEL set the pace racing just off the rail with outside pressure, was shaken up at the top of the stretch, kicked clear and was given just moderate
hand-urging the final sixteenth. RAPID EXPANSION moved up heading up the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn, drifted in and bumped a rival
at the furlong marker, secured the place. SMOKE STACK pressed the winner from outside three wide, was bumped at the eighth pole and continued to
weaken. MISS LUCKY LADY raced toward the back inside, fanned out five wide on the turn, ran on. BIG SKIPPER tracked from inside on or just off the rail,
came up empty. PEVS LUCKY KEY chased, dropped back three wide on the turn, tired. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF SMOKE
STACK AGAINST RAPID EXPANSION ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
CANYON DEL ORO set the pace racing off the rail, moved in from the three to two path on the turn, extended the advantage in upper stretch and held safe.
AMERICAN SOLO was bumped lightly at the start, tracked inside on or just off the rail, moved out turning for home, fought on for place. HALF COURT SAM
bumped a rival at the start, raced toward the rear early, went three then four wide on the turn, improved in the lane. DIABOLICAL MIGHT stalked the pace
from outside, went two to three wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick while between runners in the stretch. QUANTUM BULL switched out leaving
the backstretch, moved out further late on the turn coming six wide into upper stretch, was unable to threaten. FARMER FRED R F chased the pace from
inside but off the fence, dropped back in the two to three path on the turn, lacked room in behind late.

racing in the two path, drifted out at the three-sixteenths, was overtaken in late stretch and had no extra. HENRY ON THE RUN bumped a rival at the start,
switched out heading up the backstretch, chased three wide on the turn, flattened out late. FULL OF DRIVE chased four wide between, kept on and
narrowly missed the fourth spot. SOUTHWESTERN HOPE settled off the pace racing outside a rival, went two to three wide on the turn, angled out in upper
stretch. BASHFUL BOB broke a step slowly, shifted in, failed to threaten. SKEETER WHO raced in the two to three path through the turn while well back,
was not a factor.

Footnotes
TEAM MERCHANTS set the pace racing well off the inside going in the three to four path on the turn, kicked clear when asked and was taken in hand a
sixteenth from home once safely in front. GODDARD shifted in early, saved ground along the rail early on the turn, began to move out later on that bend
swinging six wide into upper stretch, rallied for place. MINISTER OF SOUL chased the winner from outside, exchanged a bump with a rival midway up the
backstretch, went five wide on the turn, shifted in at the top of the stretch, lost the place. EL CHAVO DEL OCHO raced outside the trailing group three to
four wide on the turn, moved out at the top of the stretch, was unable to threaten. SWEET RIVER BAINES broke slowly spotting the field about two to three
lengths, switched out and moved up between rivals two to three deep into the turn, was not a factor. MIDNIGHT SPLIT exchanged a light bump in the early
going while moving forward to pursue from between rivals, shifted in from four to two wide on the turn while dropping back, faded.

Footnotes
TIGHT FITTIN JEANS angled in soon after the start, dictated terms racing off the fence in the two to three path, was clear in upper- to mid-stretch and just
lasted. COUNT THEM AGAIN was carried in early while forwardly-positioned, eased back racing inside about the three-eighths, angled five wide turning for
home, rallied and just missed. PROOFSINTHEPUDDIN tracked in behind, entered the turn two wide, moved out six deep leaving the turn, rallied belatedly
and missed. MINDOFMYOWN pressed from outside, went three to four wide on the turn, had no extra for the drive. FLAXY LADY lacked early speed
despite some encouragement, switched out heading up the backstretch, went four to seven wide on the turn, ran on mildly. LEMON DROP GOLD stumbled
badly at the start, moved in from three to two wide on the turn, failed to rally. LINE CALL chased briefly from inside, altered course in upper stretch.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SHARAPOVA stalked the pace from outside, travelled mostly three to four wide throughout, took closer order late on the far turn, took charge by the
sixteenth pole, edged clear under urging and held. LADY COMMISSIONER settled at the rear three wide, began to advance past foes four wide on the far
turn moving out six deep later on that bend, took aim and was gaining but too late. LISETTE settled mid-pack, went four to five wide on both turns, kept on
in late stretch. OUR IRIS ROSE angled in soon after the start, ceded the lead racing on or just off the rail, moved through inside to regain control heading to
the far turn, lacked the needed late kick. GEMSTONE GAL was forced in heading to the first turn, bumped with a rival, entered the turn in the two path,
steadied past the seven-eighths when appearing to take an awkward step, continued near the inside, failed to menace. UNIQUE BABE was bumped and
steadied heading to the first turn, raced inside, failed to threaten. BOLD REY was urged from the break, forced to steady in tight quarters as a rival came in,
continued to be urged and moved up outside that one to force the pace, came up empty. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS
OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF BOLD REY AGAINST OUR IRIS ROSE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AFTER THE START, THE LATTER WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED SEVENTH BEHIND THE FORMER.

Footnotes
CHEESE TRAY set the early tempo moving in from three to two wide on the first turn, contended inside up the backstretch, eased back heading to the far
turn, angled out at the quarter pole, bid six wide between runners and edged to the lead. JET N G broke a step slowly, settled in the two to three path,
fanned seven wide on the far turn commencing a bid, had a narrow and brief lead but was outfinished. SHINING SOURCE raced in the back half of the field
four to five wide early, advanced outside rivals up the backstretch, bid five wide coming to the quarter pole, evened out in the drive. DELBERT TOO settled
at the rear roughly four wide early, swung eight wide turning for home and gained mildly to improve position. ALL CHROME raced mid-pack mostly four
wide, kept on to regain improved position. EFFORT N RESULTS was caught six wide on the first turn, moved to bid four wide on the far turn but could not
sustain the effort. EVACUEE broke a bit awkwardly, settled toward the rear two to three wide, came out a bit in the stretch and improved position. COMET
CAUSEY was forwardly-placed heading into the first turn moving in from four wide early on that bend to contend for the lead two deep up the backstretch,
gave way in the lane. NEXT AFFAIR was caught six wide early, took slightly closer order four wide on the far turn but came up empty. STORM BAYOU was
caught five wide on the first turn, stalked the leaders up the backstretch, bid three wide between foes then flattened out. SEA EMPEROR was in tight along
the inside entering the first turn, failed to threaten. RISKY REVENGE was in tight two wide into the first turn, dropped back from a more forward position up
the backstretch and shifted out, faded.

outside to get up for the top prize. ALI ALLEY settled mid-pack three wide early, still had much to do four to five wide on the far turn, made a solid late bid
but was outfinished for the win while getting up for place. MANORELLI sped clear opening up and angling in heading to the first turn, dictated terms from off
the fence, weakened in the stretch. TYLER'S DREAM hopped at the start, was unhurried early three wide, swung six deep on the far turn, closed steadily.
OPTIONALITY was caught four wide on the first turn, moved in and tracked two deep into the far turn, kept on evenly inside but had no extra. CALI was
forwardly-positioned off the leader but in with the second group three wide early, dropped back up the backstretch, continued three to four wide on the far
turn and failed to rally. MISS HARD KNOCKS shifted in tracking in behind foes three wide on the first turn, advanced outside up the backstretch, was within
striking distance three to five wide on the far turn but came up empty. LANDSLID settled well back inside, went two then three wide on the far turn, angled in
once in upper stretch and had no rally. PUMPKIN BREAD chased up close inside briefly, dropped back and faded. QUEEN OF THORNS stumbled at the
start losing the rider, walked off. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION OPENING QUARTER-MILE FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

runners at the top of the stretch, made a solid bid but was fended off. LONZO WHO was caught four wide gaining a forward position through the first turn,
forced the issue on the far turn going three to four wide, was outkicked in the stretch. JET SET WARRIOR settled well back three wide, advanced on the far
turn fanning seven wide out of that bend and continued to gain steadily in the stretch. BODIE GOT GOLD was up close racing inside early, dropped back
heading to the far turn, swung out six wide coming out of that bend and kept on in the stretch. WHERES BRAYDEN stalked from outside five wide, made a
mild bid four to five wide on the far turn but could not sustain the effort. I THINK I'M HERE was in a bit tight after the start, trailed while four wide early,
passed rivals on the far turn going four then seven wide, came in a bit at the top of the stretch and ran on. WEALTH N HEALTH was getting out heading into
the first turn going three wide on that bend, dropped back toward the rear up the backstretch, went three to four wide on the far turn and could not threaten.
READS PET ZENON steadied heading into the first turn racing two wide, made a swift move up to be just in behind the leaders between calls early up the
backstretch, lacked room and was eased back off the leaders, came up empty. MARK'S WARRIOR shifted in early, went two wide on the turns and was
never a threat.

SLOW DOWN ANDY dueled inside a rival but off the fence, edged away leaving the far turn while drifting five wide coming out of that bend, was challenged
by a rival in upper stretch being headed by that one who was far outside but dug in under steady handling to hold sway. BYE BYE BOBBY stalked three
wide off the dueling leaders, advanced on the far turn floating seven wide into upper stretch and putting a narrow head in front, drifted out a bit and lost
control but kept on gamely. PEPPER SPRAY bumped a rival lightly at the start, was caught four wide early, began to pass rivals three wide on the far turn,
captured show honors but was no threat to the top pair. FOWLER BLUE settled off the leaders inside on or off the rail, shifted out at the half-mile marker,
went three to four wide on the far turn, needed more. CHROME KING was bumped both sides at the start, raced last but one five wide on the first turn,
advanced heading into the far turn swinging seven wide out of that bend, evened out in the lane. COSTA TERRA failed to threaten after racing inside on or
just off the fence. STRAIGHT UP G bumped a rival at the start, dueled outside the winner three wide, drifted five wide leaving the far turn while weakening,
faded. CLASSIC MOMENT was mid-pack inside early, dropped back, pulled up in the stretch, vanned off.

Footnotes
IZA DADDY settled mid-pack four wide, took closer order early up the backstretch, continued the pursuit five wide on the far turn, struck a narrow lead in
upper stretch and edged clear. SEXY DEXY stalked four to five wide, moved to challenge after half, drew clear three wide on the far turn, was outkicked in
the lane. WE'RE JUST SAYIN was hard to load, settled inside on or just off the rail, found room inside turning for home and was gaining but too late. ARCH
CITY settled in the back half four to five wide, came out in upper stretch and improved. TRUST MANDO settled toward the back three to four wide, improved
position. ARIMONY was forwardly-placed three to four wide pressing the pace, switched outside the leader at the half, came up empty. GORKY PARK
saved ground along the inside through the first turn racing close up, dropped back heading to the far turn and moved out, went two to three wide on that
bend and failed to rally. PHOENIX FIRE steadied slightly after the break, settled into stride three wide in behind, went five to six wide on the far turn and was
not a threat. ATTILA'S FLAG was mid-pack three wide early, dropped back and moved out four to five wide on the far turn, offered no late bid. SOUTHERN
SUMMER set the early pace in the two path, faltered and faded.
