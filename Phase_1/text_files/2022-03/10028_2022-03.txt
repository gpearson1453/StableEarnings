Footnotes
SING ALONG SUZY angled inwards stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, moved through to wrest the advantage after a half, went clear
racing through the far turn and came under firm right handed pressure to maintain a safe margin to the end. WORKING OVERTIME, unhurried outside foes
racing to the backstretch, commenced a steady, three wide advance on the far turn, then continued willingly in that path to close the gap while only second
best. BEAUTIFUL TIZ, reserved inside foes racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain
position to the end. LUNA QUEEN was rated between foes tracking the leaders from out of striking distance to the backstretch and lacked a closing
response. NANCY WORK, urged to a forward placing three wide racing to the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the eventual winner to upper stretch and
gave way. SUNDRENCHED, urged to the lead racing off the rail dictating the pace on a clear margin to the backstretch, gave way between foes racing into
the far turn.

Footnotes
TIZ LOTTIE was rated tracking the pacesetter from out of striking distance racing outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to commence a steady
advance nearing the far turn, quickly closed the gap to wrest command racing past the quarter mile marker, went clear into upper stretch and came under
firm right handed pressure to maintain the advantage to the end. FANCYSOUL, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide
on the far turn and continued willingly in that path to steadily close the gap on the winner to the end. BIONDA SUPRISE was settled near the inside racing to
the backstretch, tipped outside foes nearing upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position while edging a rival for a share. UPPER SPEED
DS hopped at the start while breaking slowly, settled last racing to the far turn, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch and displayed some belated
interest. JUST LIKE INDY tracked off the second flight a bit off the inside to the backstretch, was prompted to make a brief gain between foes racing through
the far turn but came up empty in the drive. DEESSE tracked the pacesetter from out of striking distance inside the eventual winner to the backstretch but
faded after a half. CHILLIN LADY was sent clear racing to the first turn, opened a commanding margin on the backstretch, continued to set the pace into the
far turn and gave out abruptly approaching the quarter mile marker.

Footnotes
KITTY KITTY was urged to gain the lead inside a rival soon after the start, dictated the pace on a narrow margin on her own courage racing into the bend,
edged forward racing into upper stretch and came under some right handed pressure to maintain a safe margin. GRAND MAMOO broke readily, raced in
touch with the eventual winner prompting that rival racing into the bend, continued with a steady bid to late stages but proved only second best. LA
ALHAMBRA tracked the leaders along the inside racing to the turn, tipped to the three path racing into upper stretch but had no rally. SO MOXIE broke
inwards bumping PLAY THAT TONE, was righted to track the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the turn, was fanned to the four path in upper
stretch but had no rally. PLAY THAT TONE, bumped at the start, settled last racing to the turn and failed to menace. WHISTLER DIXIE broke outwards
bumping PLAY THAT TONE, was switched out making brief pursuit of the leaders three wide on the backstretch, shifted inwards nearing the turn and soon
gave way.

Footnotes
LI'L MISS CAMILLE broke sharply, sped clear along the inside racing to the turn, held sway on a comfortable margin into upper stretch, then maintained the
advantage under mild hand urging in a ridden out effort. SAVE THE FLAG tracked the pacesetter outside foes in the opening stages, continued willingly into
the stretch to prove best of the others but couldn't gain even terms with the winner. R FUNNY BIZNESS tracked the pacesetter between foes, then angled
inwards nearing the turn continuing in pursuit of the leader but finished evenly. ALLEZ LELE settled outside foes in the opening stages, shifted inwards
racing into the bend and gained some position between foes while making no impression. LINDSEY LUCK, off last, was urged along the inside on the
backstretch, eased back to last entering the turn, then shifted four wide in upper stretch to make a second effort while no real threat. TIPHARAH settled
between foes in early stages, shifted out three wide racing into the lane but had no rally. REMEMBEROLDTYMES made brief pursuit of the leaders inside
foes and dropped out early.

Footnotes
BARREL OF BLISS forwardly placed along the inside racing just behind the pacesetter to the backstretch, tipped out to challenge that foe racing through the
far turn, gained a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch, drifted out to the four path in the closing stages but maintained a narrow margin to the end
under some right handed pressure. NO VALLA, firmly rated between foes dropping well off the leaders to the backstretch, steadily gained position three
wide racing into upper stretch, then split rivals in that path nearing the wire to just miss. FAST FASHION was urged to the lead while angling inside racing to
the first turn, dictated the pace to the far turn, then grudgingly resisted to late stages. FIRST LADY DI DA, reserved outside foes racing to the backstretch,
switched outside foes racing into the stretch and improved her position late. WICKED INTENT broke slowly, settled last to the backstretch, swung out to the
five path in upper stretch and gained position in a belated rally. SWEET TINA angled inwards tracking behind the second flight racing to the backstretch,
steadily gained position between foes racing into the far turn but flattened out midstretch. SHE'S JUST QUALITY angled to the inside tracking just off the
leaders in the opening half but steadily faded into the stretch. HURRY UP DEAR, rated along the inside to the backstretch, steadied off KITTENS MISS
MOJO midway through the backstretch and never menaced thereafter. DREAM TRACER proved no factor. KITTENS MISS MOJO tracked the leaders
along the inside to the backstretch but retreated early.

Footnotes
WHO'S THE STAR, reserved last racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position after a half, split foes entering the far turn, angled to the rail nearing
upper stretch while continuing with a solid late response, came through inside the pacesetter to wrest the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went
clear under firm encouragement. TAPSASIONAL, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just inside the pacesetter racing through the backstretch to the
far turn, tipped out three wide racing into the stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors. DREAM KEEPER sprinted to the lead a
bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, held sway on a narrow advantage into upper stretch but yielded to the top pair late. HARD LIGHTING was rated
tracking the leaders from well out of striking distance along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch and gained some position
in an even effort. SHALDAG, pulling between foes racing just behind the pacesetter to the first turn, switched out three deep entering the backstretch while
being urged to prompt the pacesetter to the second bend but gave way racing into the stretch. BROTHER BRAD, caught four wide in the opening stages,
shifted inwards while being urged pursuing the pacesetter to the backstretch and gave way early. ALLEN, held up outside foes racing into the first turn,
dropped out early.

Footnotes
ROWDY JESS, bumped at the start, was reserved along the inside to the backstretch, switched out four wide racing into the far turn, then continued with a
steady effort in that path racing into the stretch and rallied to the front in time under firm handling. PROCURADOR, carried out by SCREAMIN JALAPENO in
the opening stages, was settled between foes racing to the backstretch, tipped out three deep nearing the second bend advancing on the leaders, moved to
challenge the pacesetter in late stages and was just outkicked while finishing on even terms for the place honors. GREAT JUNIOR sped to the lead while
angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a clear margin to upper stretch but was collared late while finishing on even terms to share
second. STRATFORD settled between foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was shuffled out of tight quarters racing into the second bend,
swung out five wide nearing upper stretch and gained some position while lacking the needed final response. BENCH WALK, bumped at the start, pulled
between foes, then bobbled momentarily when clipping heels racing through the chute, tipped out three wide racing to the backstretch while being prompted
to make a brief advance but came empty racing into the far turn. BALLINDERRY worked his way to the inside tracking off the second flight to the
backstretch, then steadily faded racing into the far turn. THATZA ALPHA tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight and gave way racing into the
far turn. PLAYING GOLD angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight for six furlong and gave way racing into the far turn.
MARQUET MALICE was reserved outside foes and dropped out early. SCREAMIN JALAPENO broke inwards bumping BENCH WALK, swerved out
carrying out PROCURADOR in the opening stages, then quickly dropped out early.

Footnotes
KING FORCE broke readily, dictated the pace a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, held sway on a widening margin into upper stretch and came under
firm right handed pressure to remain clear to the end. PRAKRITI was settled last racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes nearing the far turn,
commenced a steady advance four wide through the far turn to upper stretch and continued with interest to close the gap on the winner late. SETTE
STELLE, forwardly placed three deep in the opening stages, was rated outside foes tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance to the
backstretch, was prompted to gain position three wide racing into the far turn but lacked the needed final kick. GIOVANE'S PROMISE, rated between foes in
the opening stages, angled to the inside racing into the backstretch to track the pacesetter as part of the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and
faded in the drive. AND THE OSCAR GOES, urged to a forward placing between foes racing to the first turn, tracked the pacesetter as part of the second
flight to the far turn and faded into upper stretch. PRIVATE CODE tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane and offered no
rally. LYLA'S MARK settled between foes and never gained contention. TUTANKHAMUNATCHA settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the
backstretch and dropped out entering the far turn.

Footnotes
SLIME QUEEN was rated along the inside behind the second flight racing to the first turn, tipped outside rivals entering the backstretch, shifted out three
wide on the far turn to challenge the leaders nearing upper stretch, went clear entering the lane and held sway to the end under firm encouragement.
MUSETTA switched outside foes racing to the backstretch tracking off the second flight, was prompted to advance four wide on the far turn to upper stretch
and proved best of the others. TOWERING GAZE tracked off the second flight outside foes in early stages, was caught five wide nearing upper stretch
gaining some position and finished evenly. R TENDERONI tracked just off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, was shuffled avoiding
close quarters racing through the far turn, then angled outside foes in the stretch to regain some position late. SPEED SALSA, reserved along the inside to
the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, tipped outside tiring foes entering the lane, lost some momentum when caught in traffic midstretch but
continued with interest to gain some position. PLATINUMCENTS, urged to a forward placing along the inside tracking just off the leaders, tipped out racing
into the stretch but faded between rivals late. D FLAT WHITE settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. SPEAK ENGLISH
switched off the inside pursuing the pacesetter into the backstretch, moved to terms with that foe after a half, pressed the issue into the far turn and gave
way abruptly racing into upper stretch. TRULY proved no factor. JARA was hustled to the lead along the inside racing through the chute, set the pace on a
clear margin to the backstretch, dueled inside a rival racing into the second bend and emptied out into the lane.
