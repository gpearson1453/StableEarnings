Footnotes
I FEEL THE NEED void of early foot, came three wide out of the final turn, shifted out further nearing midstretch, challenged on the outside of the first flight
late, quickly clear to win going away. LADY COMMANDER prompted the issue up front off the inside, continued to stalk three wide into the far turn,
challenged soon after, floated out to be four wide into the lane, battled past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late, proved game to be
edging away for the place. MARTIQUE MISS broke in, set or forced the pace just off the inside, narrowly showed the way into and through upper stretch,
weakened in the late going while managing to save the show. QUALITY CHROME settled off the pace and the inside, closer in some traffic midway on the
final turn, knifed out and challenged three wide and between foes turning into the lane, vied then hung late. AUTOSTRADA moved up inside to contest the
pace into the first turn, set or forced the issue the middle half, began to weaken turning for home then continued to falter. MAKEMEBELIEVE in tight at the
start, failed to muster a rally. FARASINO remained always back. TRUEBLUEGIRL finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
RATTRAPANTE took control the opening quarter, cleared to the inside late backstretch, relaxed through the turn. BRIAR THICKET bobbled at the start,
raced back off the pace, continued unhurried in the two path, saved some ground into the lane, steered out when straightened for home, finished willingly to
be in time for the place, not a threat to the winner. MILANA chased the leader while off the inside, proved no match for that one in the drive, caught late for
the place. DEDE'S TRICK broke back, raced three wide through the turn, lacked serious kick. DESERT GLOW forwardly placed while racing off the inside,
came up empty for the drive. KEINO broke slowly, trailed for half then picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. GAME OF INCHES raced in
mid pack and inside, tired. TEXAS LEXUS tired after a half while racing three wide.

Footnotes
LIL KINGS PRINCESS dueled up front early off the inside, drew clear before a quarter, held a long lead while rating up the backstretch, continued to hold a
sizable advantage into the lane, not threatened through the stretch while being kept to task. BEACH FLOWER settled off rail, rallied for the place, not a
serious threat to the winner late, clear for the second spot. BOLD TACTICS pinballed just after the start, settled in mid pack while along the inside,
continued to save ground into and through the final turn, moved out a bit for the drive, between rivals past the furlong marker, continued evenly to the finish
to report home best of the rest. PRETTI XTREME bumped with BOLD TACTICS just after the start, raced off the inside, three wide into the lane, made little
impact to the wire. ITSALLINTHENOTES dueled up front into the first turn inside the winner, allowed that one to go midway on that bend, chased up the
backstretch and into the far turn while off the inside, gave way in the drive. TURNSTONE brush just after the start, fell back to trail, failed to menace.

Footnotes
SIGNOFTHECROSS closest to the leader off the inside, challenged between rivals through the final turn, hooked up with the runner up outside that one
entering the stretch, extended duel to the wire, dug in late to prevail in game fashion. LEADING WEST within striking distance inside, was covered up late
backstretch, continued to save ground in the second turn, slipped through along the rail to challenge into the stretch, long duel to the wire, outkicked in the
late going. NOTARY back off the pace toward the inside, saved ground in some traffic through the second bend, moved out for the drive, clear for the show
while not a threat to the top pair. SOL DEL SUR within striking distance off the inside, moved closer three wide in the final turn, failed to sustain that
advance in the drive. JAY VEE BEE void of speed, three wide turning into the lane, improved position while not a serious threat. OPTIMUS KAT settled off
the pace, and the inside, had little for the drive. SPHEROID shuffled back at the start to be last away, trailed most of the way, picked off a couple of tiring
rivals while never involved. TOMA TODO broke alertly, clear early, set the pace off the rail, gave way when headed turning for home. CATHOLIC GUILT
settled off the pace and the inside, four wide trip throughout, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
SUMMER SHOES close from the start while off the inside, quickly shook clear when shaken up entering the stretch, steadily drew out to win in a sharp
effort. PATTERN BET within striking distance up the backstretch, closer in the turn while racing in the three path, proved no match in the drive. GOLD
STRATEGY off slowly to trail early, steered out to be four wide when advancing turning for home, rallied to be clear for the show, not a threat to the top pair.
HAMAZING DEBATE settled in mid pack toward the inside, came three wide into the lane, closest to the top two past the furlong marker, flattened out to be
overtaken for the show spot. MISS RITA lacked speed while off the inside, three wide through the turn, made little impact in the drive. SWEETNESS TO off
a step slow, trailed for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. PRINIA broke alertly to set the early pace, headed midway on the turn
and began to give way. BUCKLE BUNNY RED off a step slow, moved up along the inside, stopped before a half, well back.

Footnotes
EMERALD PRINCESS away in good order, settled off the pace while moving out, roused on the outside for the drive, closed with good determination to be
up in time. EPICUREAN took command soon after the start, cleared to the inside, larger lead through the turn, continued to lead by daylight past the furlong
marker, drifted out slightly, could not contain the winner. FORTUNA ADIUVAT void of speed just off the inside, remained in the two path through the turn,
showed some belated interest to be clear for the show and was trimming the gap on the top two late. LITTLE BIRD FLASH off a step slow, trailed for most of
the way, passed some tiring rivals to improve position, not a serious threat. SUPER WONDER GIRL off a step slow, remained always back in failing to
threaten. CHASING SHADOWS went one paced while racing outside. OLIVIAN dueled up front early along the inside, chased the runner up through the
turn, gave way.

HUNKA BURNING LOVE forwardly placed while three wide through the first turn, continued to stalk up the backstretch, moved to challenge turning for
home, bid between foes then was in a bit tight a furlong out, late duel, narrowly gained the nod. FORT PECK settled off the pace while moving outside, four
wide into the far turn, three wide challenge turning for home, raced on equal terms outside the winner the final furlong, outfinished in the late going to miss.
HOME RUN TRICK took command soon after the start inside, showed the way up the backstretch through some lively fractions while looking comfortably in
hand, continued to set the pace final turn, vied past the furlong marker inside the top two then could not keep pace, narrowly saved the show.
LASTCHANCEATGLORY settled behind the leader along the inside, continued to save ground when within striking distance final turn, flattened in the drive.
LEADER OF MEN last away, lacked speed, four wide into the stretch when improving a bit, also flattened out in the final furlong to finish up one paced.
BEAR ALLEY vied early outside the leader, chased that one the middle half and faded. BODE'S MAKER was never a threat. PLENTIFUL fell back to trail
after the start, showed little.

Footnotes
WELL SPENT squeezed at the start to be off slowly, raced back and off the inside, two path into the lane, steered out a bit for room when advancing nearing
the furlong grounds, outside bid, strongly clear. URSULINA behind the first flight outside, ranged up to challenge four wide late in the turn, vied past the
furlong marker, had a head in front with a sixteenth to run, proved no match for the winner while holding sway for the place. SIANARA with the early pace off
the inside, vied between foes into and through upper stretch, held a narrow advantage with a sixteenth to run, could not last. WINGS OF AN ANGEL moved
up steadily the opening furlong to contest the issue inside, set or forced the pace until a furlong remained and began to weaken. SUNNY ISLE BEACH
broke back, lacked speed outside, raced four wide through the turn, improved position. UPANDCOMINGSTAR prompted the pace up the backstretch while
racing off the inside, lodged a brief bid inside the runner up and between rivals late in the turn, weakened through the stretch. SWEET TEA in tight at the
start, lacked speed, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. ATHENAS SONG void of speed, steadied behind a faltering NIC AND ZOE early in
the turn and did not recover. SUPER CHIANTI broke out to bother a couple of outer rivals, settled in mid pack in the run up the backstretch, was finished
before a half. NIC AND ZOE toward the front early toward the inside, lost action into the turn, gave way and was jogged in late.

Footnotes
HIDDEN PROMISE closest to the early leader while firmly in hand and just off the inside, ranged up to take over while remaining in the two path second
turn, clear when straightened for home, drifted out, increased advantage under steady handling. V. I. P. WHO in the second flight along the inside first turn,
continued within striking distance the middle half mile, crept closer in traffic late in the second bend, got through and chased the winner past the furlong
marker, could do little with that one to the wire, held sway for the place. SOMETHING NATURAL carried out four wide into the first turn, in mid pack while
racing off the inside, moved closer outside the runner up while experiencing the same traffic issues, set down between rivals into the lane, gaining for the
second spot late. COACH ADAMS angled out to be three wide and to carry SOMETHING NATURAL into the first turn, continued forwardly into the far turn,
three bid bid midway on that bend, weakened in the run through the lane. PEPPER PIKE one paced while saving ground, lacked a closing response.
ARRIVAL sprinted clear the opening quarter, set the pace for just under six furlongs along the inside then gave way when headed by the winner in the
second turn. MAJOR KONG remained back in failing to threaten. ZITMAN showed little in a dull effort.
