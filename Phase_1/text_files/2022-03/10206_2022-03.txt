Footnotes
NO MAN LEFT BEHIND secured inside position around the first turn and settled while saving ground through the backstretch, prompted four wide into the
upper stretch, steadily edged up closer and drove by POETIC CODE in late stages. POETIC CODE steadied slightly entering the first turn and prompted the
pace through the backstretch, vied for the lead around the far turn and battled on onto the lane, briefly shook free then got out-finished by the winner.
STOLEN MONEY stalked along the rail through early stages, tipped out three wide late on the final turn, shifted back inside in the upper stretch, sustained
steady response and secured a share. MEKANO tracked up close through the backstretch, loomed three wide late on the far turn, vied with POETIC CODE
a furlong out then flattened out. PRINCIPE raced two wide near midpack, hustled along three to four wide into the upper stretch and lacked the needed
response for serious impact. TAPATERM bumped with rival and came away last at the start, remained unhurried and saved ground through the backstretch,
cut the corner entering the lane then tipped a path wider and failed to move on. THOUSAND LETTERS settled off the early pace, was ridden along two wide
around the far turn, was ridden three to four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. URMIZZENTHEPOINT sped to the lead at the start, set a pressured pace
through the backstretch, dueled for the lead around the final turn then came up empty in upper stretch. STANNIS bumped with rival at the start, raced off the
pace then wide in the lane and never threatened.

QUEEN CALYPSO set the pace just off the rail and held clear under a steady drive. CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY prompted the winner from the three path,
could never gain on that foe in the lane but held second. PINO IN A PURSE saved ground in range, angled out in upper stretch and finished evenly to
maintain the show. PLAYERA chased the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a rally. FOLLOW ME MOM failed to menace
while racing four wide. SIMPLIFY (ARG) trailed inside, swung out in upper stretch and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
Z FIRST became unsettled by wayward waterfowl while showing the way into the first turn, settled down after that and rated along inside, widened the
advantage being roused into the stretch and proved much best. HARDSPUN WOMAN was a step slow at the start and lagged well back for six furlongs,
came three wide rallying off the far turn and was along outside rivals to pick up the place. CHARMED WAY was forced out six wide trying to avoid waterfowl
on the course heading into the first turn, moved back inward advancing after six furlongs, but lacked a solid closing response. MIA CAMILA got forced out
five wide attempting to avoid waterfowl on the course into the first turn, prompted Z FIRST from outside up the backstretch, could not make an impression
on that one turning for home and weakened. AMBAR never factored inside. LOMBARDI AVENUE was through early inside. KELSEY'S SHOT raced in the
second flight early, and was finished after six furlongs. PROTON PACK leapt while grazing a goose heading into the first turn, then trampled an ill-fated pink
flamingo, and retired after a half-mile. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
CAGUA settled and saved ground through early stages, remained patiently handled along the rail with three furlongs left to run, given cue two wide leaving
the turn then tipped wider for the drive, steadily edged up closer and drove by CINDY'S SONG in late stages. CINDY'S SONG showed the way around the
first turn and set a pressured pace through the backstretch, vied with SNEAKY CHEEKY around the far turn then shook free turning for home, continued on
top into the final sixteenth then got denied by the winner. SUSANS NOVELA was well placed stalking the embattled duo through early stages, loomed three
wide late on the far turn, sustained bid in the lane and secured a share. TRUE BLUE PEARL was off a step slow at the start then rated two to three wide up
the backstretch, hustled up around the far turn, came four wide into the upper stretch and ran on evenly. SNEAKY CHEEKY pressed the pace up the
backstretch, vied outside of CINDY'S SONG around the final turn, continued in contention in the upper stretch then weakened in the final furlong. NO
NANNETTE NO tracked in the second flight while saving ground, failed to progress along the rail around the final turn then gave way in the lane. MISS
CALIFORNIA settled off the early pace while never too far back, roused three wide around the final turn and lacked a needed rally. RUN UP DISTANCE

Footnotes
MISSY GREER set the pace in the two path, drew off nearing the quarter pole and widened under a drive. FRIENDSHIP ROAD prompted the winner four
wide, could not keep pace nearing the quarter pole but stayed on to be clearly second best. GREAT ADVENTURE was bumped at the start, raced well
back, went three wide around the turn and was along for the show. HOT BODE saved ground well back, angled out in upper stretch, continued on the left
lead in the lane and never threatened. RITA MARGA broke out and bumped GREAT ADVENTURE, stalked the pace inside and came up empty in the lane.
OAXACA was up close three wide between foes and retreated nearing the lane. I'M BAFFLED bobbled at the break and played no factor while racing two
wide. RUM SWIZZLE was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
DOMINATE THEMOMENT raced close up between horses for six furlongs, tipped out three wide taking aim outside the leaders turning for home, and wore
down EXCHANGE DAY in the closing yards. EXCHANGE DAY set the pace inside, responded when challenged by SUPER DESIGN approaching the
stretch, dug in through a long drive against that one and DOMINATE THEMOMENT, but was overtaken late by the latter. SUPER DESIGN prompted the
pace outside EXCHANGE DAY, battled between that one and DOMINATE THEMOMENT through the stretch and yielded late. DRILLOMATIC saved
ground to the stretch, and improved position without threatening. MISTER LEONARDO broke a step slow, lagged well back for six furlongs, and gained
belatedly on the far outside. MAGICAL MARRIAGE was under a firm hold three wide off the early leaders, and came up empty when roused. MARISA'S
MISSION was outrun early two wide, went further out on the far turn, and could not reach contention. ASTROTURF was no factor. TIMMY M. made no
impact outside. CENTERFOLDPROSPECT faded inside after six furlongs. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
OUR FANTASY stalked three wide up the backstretch, launched a bid for SMARMY around the turn, came four to five wide into the upper stretch, stayed on
determinedly and drew clear in the final sixteenth. BATTLE CRY pressed the pace through the backstretch, was ridden along but flattened midway around
the turn, shifted out wider for the drive, sustained a steady outside bid and regained place. CELESTIAL CHEETAH was unhurried and raced near the inside,
swung wide entering the upper stretch, continued a steady outside effort and got up late for a share. SMARMY gained the advantage coming out of the
chute and set a pressured pace up the backstretch, held firm over pursuers around the turn, continued to put in a game effort while tiring in the upper stretch
then gave way grudgingly in the final sixteenth. HEIRESSINDY rated off the top trio through early stages, was ridden along the inside around the turn, cut
the corner and gained closer contention then flattened out late. RASPBERRY BALLET rated off the early pace, hustled along two wide into the upper
stretch, gained a bit of ground then ran on evenly. TIZ ENOUGH was reserved and five paths wide through early stages, came three wide into the upper
stretch and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
CHICA BOOM had her heels clipped by THE CUBAN MISSLE early, saved ground off the pace, angled four wide turning for home, had her heels clipped by
TIZ IMPRESSIVE near the three-sixteenths pole, closed determinedly outside, reached near even terms outside of KING'S LEGACY leaving the sixteenth
pole was bumped by that foe soon after, causing her to switch back to the left lead, fought on outside and got her nose down on the wire. KING'S LEGACY
came out early and bumped CAPTEOWN CANDY into CALI DIVINE, raced in range three wide, took the lead in upper stretch, drew clear in midstretch,
drifted out under left-handed urging late and bumped the winner, fought on inside of that foe to the wire and lost the bob. TIZ IMPRESSIVE settled off the
pace while racing three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, clipped the winner's heels in upper stretch, took several strides to regain balance
then closed gamely outside to gain the show. L. E. GRAY raced well back two and three wide, rallied between foes in the lane and had to steady off heels in
deep stretch. SINFULICIOUS raced off the early pace four wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, bid in upper stretch, remained in contention past
the sixteenth pole while seeming outkicked by the winner then was in tight when KING'S LEGACY drifted out leaving the sixteenth pole. TEMPERMENTAL
failed to menace while racing four wide. CAPETOWN CANDY was bumped into CALI DIVINE when KING'S LEGACY got out early, dropped well back
inside, swung ten wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. PRINCESS TERESKA raced closest to the runaway pacesetter while saving ground, advanced
inside around the far turn, angled two wide turning for home and weakened. BLUE KENTUCKY GIRL sprinted off to set a clear pace inside and faltered
around the far turn. CALI DIVINE was bumped between foes early, saved ground off the pace, made progress at the rail in upper stretch, lacked room in
midstretch, tipped out and lacked a further bid. THE CUBAN MISSILE clipped heels and nearly unseated the rider soon after the start and was always well
back while racing two and three wide around the turns. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN UPPER STRETCH AND
FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
