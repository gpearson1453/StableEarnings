OUR LITTLE TIGER pressed the pace of STORM THE PALACE while racing three-wide, responded when set down for the drive and wore down that rival in
the closing yards. STORM THE PALACE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter but
could not resist the winner late. MONGOLIAN ROSE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response.
WHO B DAT was off slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn and finished evenly. SHIP'S CREEK was void of early speed, raced off the
rail through the turn and failed to rally. WORKIN NINETOFIVE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

MAJESTIC STREET sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and held gamely to the wire. PIKNITUPLAYNITDOWN was void of early
speed, raced five-wide through the turn, rallied late and just missed. DIA DE PAGO tracked the leaders from the inside, could not get by the winner late but
finished with a steady bid. BECKHAM JAMES showed no early speed, steadied from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths marker and finished with
some late run when clear. PARTYOFSIXTEEN chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. GOLDEN STAR ROCK
was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally.

Footnotes
SHE'S EXPENSIVE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore into the lane and was ridden out to be kept
to task. SWEET LADY LANA sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was no match for the winner in the drive but held on well to save
the place. NETS LAZY LADY was off slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn and finished with a steady rally. ARIZONA BREW tracked
the leaders from the inside and failed to gain in the drive. STEINWAY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the
needed rally. FIVE CIRCLES chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. CHARMINGKINDAGAL was void of early speed,
raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
VELVET GHOST dueled for the lead from between foes, responded when set down for the drive and gamely prevailed. BUGLER lacked early speed, raced
four-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run, bumped with AMERICAN BUDDHA and was gaining on the winner late. TENGAS
MASTERPIECE disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final sixteenth. AMERICAN BUDDHA settled off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, bumped with BUGLER in mid-stretch and did not threaten. YEROSILVERBIZ was forwardly placed early,
moved four-wide through the turn and gave way through the final furlong. BEAR BRIAN lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. SPEEDING STYLE showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. HAMMERING LEMON showed brief speed and
weakened.
