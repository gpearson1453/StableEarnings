Footnotes
AYCAPOTE broke readily, was urged to the lead just off the inside dictating the pace on a comfortable margin to the backstretch, responded nearing upper
stretch to forge clear and widened the advantage under firm encouragement. COUNTY COURT angled to the inside racing into the first turn, made a steady
gain to contention inside foes racing into the far turn, tipped outside the pacesetter racing through the far turn while being prompted to advance but couldn't
close the gap while proving best of the others. MIGHTY GHOST forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter to the far turn, steadily faded nearing the
lane. ENGLISH LAUGHTER made brief pursuit of the leaders three wide to the backstretch and steadily faded racing into the far turn. DOCTOR D J tracked
off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, offered no rally, then was vanned off the course. MIRIAM'S SKY showed little.

Footnotes
BION MAGIC angled to the inside in early stages while dropping well off the leaders on the backstretch, saved ground through the turn steadily gathering
momentum, came through inside foes to wrest the advantage nearing midstretch and kicked away late under firm encouragement. BIONIC BOTTLE, off a
step slowly, was hustled up the rail to gain a narrow advantage after the opening quarter, tipped off the rail nearing upper stretch extending the advantage,
proved no match for the winner leaving the furlong marker but kept on to prevail narrowly for the place honors. ATLANTIC PRINCESS tracked just off the
first flight through the backstretch, steadily gained three wide nearing upper stretch but flattened out late while just missing for second. PROBABLY GRACE
settled off the first flight outside foes on the backstretch, angled out four wide nearing the lane but offered no rally. CEFALO broke readily, prompted the
pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn and gave way after a half. MARICOPA ducked out at the start, settled outside a rival in the last
flight and failed to menace thereafter. CELESTIAL ORB angled to the inside in early stages to race as part of the last flight and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
FOXY AUSTIN ducked out at the start, was righted quickly to gain terms with the leaders three wide in the opening stages, shifted in making steady pursuit
of the pacesetter into the turn, moved to challenge that rival racing through the stretch and prevailed in time under right handed pressure. NATASHA'S
BIZNIZ, urged to the lead along the inside, edged forward racing into the bend, set the pace to upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid to late stages but was
collared nearing the wire. HELENS SPIRIT, carried out by the eventual winner at the start, tracked off the first flight outside rivals racing through the
backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep nearing upper stretch, then continued evenly in that path in the final furlong. NIGHTMIDST tracked off the
second flight outside rivals on the backstretch, then continued four wide through the turn to the stretch but offered no rally. VALIANT SPARK tracked off the
first flight along the inside, gained some position saving ground but lacked the needed late response. AZULENE tracked off the first flight between foes on
the backstretch but dropped out early. VEGAS SLIPPERS flashed brief pace between foes prompting the pacesetter in the opening quarter but gave way
nearing the lane. ADRIANNA'S ROCKET, off slowly, then carried out at the start, was soon outdistanced, then was pulled up racing into the stretch, then
was vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
KNIGHT OFTHE CROWN angled inwards to track the pacesetter between foes as part of the second flight, was prompted to split rivals three deep racing
past the quarter mile marker bid for command, then went clear in the closing stages under pressure. MY MAN VITO bobbled at the start, settled last to the
backstretch, split rivals racing into the far turn to advance on the leaders five wide into upper stretch but flattened late. BANDITOFTHEPRAIRIE tracked the
pace three deep in second flight to the backstretch, gained on the leaders four wide racing through the far turn but had no late kick. PELLEGRINI angled to
the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, switched outside foes entering upper stretch but had no late bid. DADASHEV was
urged prompting the pace outside a rival to the backstretch and faded between foes into the stretch. CHARLIE'S NO SAINT sprinted to the lead, dictated the
pace along the inside to the far turn and gave way once headed racing into upper stretch. BROADWAY RUCKUS tracked off the second flight outside foes
to the backstretch and offered no rally. SUPER NECESSARY rated along the inside to the backstretch, dropped out early. CEDAR BEACH was settled
between foes and dropped out early.

Footnotes
JAZZY TIMES sprinted clear outside foes in the opening stages, held sway on a comfortable margin through the turn to upper stretch and was kept to
pressure. FOX ROX was rated just off the second flight while angling inside nearing the turn, came around a rival racing nearing the lane, angled back to the
rail and proved best of the others. SAVVY LAYLA settled off the second flight along the inside early, saved ground on the turn, then shifted out to split foes
entering upper stretch but continued with interest to improve position. SKIPPY'S STRIKE settled well off the leaders in early stages, swung out four wide
racing into the stretch and gained some position while making no impact. BRILLIANT JOURNEY tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the
turn, shifted out three wide entering the stretch but had no rally. SAMAY broke awkwardly, dropped out last and failed to menace. ABE HONESTLY made
brief pursuit of the pacesetter in the two path racing into the bend and emptied out into upper stretch. SILVER TUNES was urged to contend inside foes and
emptied out early.

Footnotes
BASTIEN LE BROWN broke inwards while gaining a forward placing in the opening stages, was eased off the pace in the second furlong, shifted out four
wide nearing the turn while coming under prompting to advance, continued with a steady bid to gain terms with the pacesetter leaving midstretch and
prevailed in time under firm right handed encouragement. LIL BULL angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, edged
away to a clear advantage while angling inside racing into the turn, maintained the advantage past midstretch but was collared late. FRANKIE Z settled last
in early stages, shifted out five wide with a half mile to go, continued in that path to the lane and finished evenly while earning a share. MR. MAZZA angled
to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing through the backstretch, was shuffled back behind SPANISH SOUL entering the turn and had no closing bid.
GIVE IT A GO tracked off the first flight between foes in early stages, was urged to advance entering the bend but quickly came up empty. SPANISH SOUL,
urged along the inside disputing the pace through the backstretch, emptied out racing into the turn. EAGLE KEEPER switched out when losing his path to
the eventual winner at the break, was urged to contend three wide between foes on the backstretch, gave way entering the turn, was pulled up racing into
upper stretch, then was vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
CHINA BEACH angled to the inside while being rated off the second flight racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum racing into the far turn, came
through inside foes midway through the bend when presented an opening to wrest command, then maintained the advantage through the stretch under firm
encouragement. MONETIZED, reserved along the inside just behind the eventual winner racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, was
roused to close the gap on the winner but couldn't gain terms with that foe. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE, reserved between foes racing to the backstretch,
angled to the rail after a half, continued along the inside to the lane and made an effort to improve position. DEREGULATION (GB) was rated tracking the
pacesetter inside rivals in second flight racing to the backstretch, tipped out entering the far turn while being carried out slightly by the drifting pacesetter but
had no closing bid. LORD OF THE NILE tracked the leader outside rivals in second flight, was fanned four wide while being urged to advance on the far turn
but lacked the needed late bid. DUSTGETSINYOUREYES tracked the pace between foes in second flight, lodged a brief bid three wide between foes on
the far turn and came up empty in the drive. MISTER FERNANDO tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, was checked when
caught behind MYQUEST midway through the far turn and had no further response. NOBLE CROSS settled last to the backstretch, altered course five wide
avoiding traffic nearing upper stretch and proved no threat. MYQUEST sprinted clear of the field racing to the backstretch, held sway to the far turn and
gave out abruptly between foes entering the second bend. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT
ON THE FAR TURN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

opening stages, set the pace on a narrow margin racing to the turn, shook clear racing into upper stretch and widened late under firm left handed
encouragement. TACTICAL RANGE settled between foes in the last flight racing through the backstretch, came under prompting to advance while switching
out racing into the bend, swung four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to edge a rival for the place honors. LITTLE
MISS SASSY tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, tipped out entering the stretch while being roused to advance but lacked the
needed final bid. ACACIAHELPME was rated off the second flight along the inside, saved ground through the turn and gained some position late with an
even effort. READY TO FILM, bumped, then carried in at the start, switched outside the pacesetter while being urged to prompt that foe to the turn, then

racing just off the second flight, faded between foes into the turn. LADY IN HEELS, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the leaders racing into the
turn, gave way into the lane. SUMMER HELPER, caught in tight quarters at the start, dropped out early.

Footnotes
AWILDAS TREASURE, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, prompted that foe racing through the far turn, took over nearing
upper stretch and made the balance of the pace under steady pressure. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY was rated off the second flight along the inside, saved
ground on the far turn briefly awaiting an opening, tipped outside a tiring foe entering the stretch and wrested the place honors late. MYSTIC DREAMS,
reserved a bit off the inside tracking behind the third flight to the backstretch, continued between foes under patient handling racing into the far turn, split
foes racing through upper stretch and narrowly prevailed for a share in time. PEACELOVENKARMA tracked the pace inside foes in second flight, tipped out
three wide racing through the stretch but had no closing bid. SCHATZI, reserved just off the inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes on the far
turn, was fanned six wide entering the stretch and displayed some belated interest. SASSY CAT, urged along the rail dictating the pace from the outset to
the far turn, briefly resisted the winner's bid but gave way midstretch. LADY TEUFLESBERG, pulling between foes behind the second flight racing to the
backstretch, eased back, then switched outside foes to make some brief progress four wide on the far turn but had no closing response. FARCICAL,
reserved last along the inside to the far turn, never gained contention. MAJESTIC QUEEN, caught four wide leaving the chute, tracked off the first fight
outside a rival to the far turn, drifted out nearing the lane and steadily faded. BEAUTY GENIUS tracked off the second flight three wide to the backstretch
and steadily faded nearing the lane.
