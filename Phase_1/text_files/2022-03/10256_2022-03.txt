Footnotes
COTOPAXI (IRE) sped to the front from inside, inched away in upper stretch and remained clear under some right-handed urging and strong handling.
MOTORIOUS (GB) was off slow to begin, tracked three deep around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied for second. GUILDSMAN (FR) stalked
along the inside, saved ground to the stretch and got edged for the place honors. ISTANBUL broke well, was closest in pursuit in the two path into and
around the turn, chased between rivals in deep stretch and lacked the needed late bid. STAR RACER broke out, angled down to the two path chasing the
leader, raced between rivals and lacked room on the turn, remained behind rivals to midstretch then angled to the outside but was too late. CAISSON
chased outside a rival, three wide around the turn and flattened in the lane.

Footnotes
HIGH CONNECTION went up to take control early and set the pace inside a trio of rivals, maintained a short lead through the turn, shook free at the top of
the stretch, powered away in the final furlong and was ridden out to the wire. PIONEERING PAPA pressed the pace from outside into and around the turn,
lost contact at the top of the stretch, flattened in the final furlong but kept on to hold second. B DAWK attended the pace three deep early on, angled to the
rail around the bend, churned on through the lane and gained the show. DEVIL MOON raced up close on the pace four deep to the turn, could not keep up
with the top pair around the bend and chased three wide to the stretch and got edged for the show honors. GO JOE WON broke a step slow, sat off the
pace up the backstretch, went four wide into the turn, exited three wide and failed to threaten. ROYAL ORB tossed his head and came away slow to begin,
trailed four then three wide on the turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
YOUTEYOURHONOR was off slow to begin, pulled early on the inside, steered out and went three wide while rank on the first turn, was still hard to handle
near the halfway point and had to check at the seven-sixteenths pole, swung out leaving the second bend, rallied through the lane and overhauled the
runner-up. MADIHA had early speed but was rated on the inside, tipped outside the leader around the clubhouse turn, went up to prompt the pace up the
backstretch, dueled past the quarter pole and took a short lead into the stretch, kicked clear from SMILIN EVIE but got run down by the winner late.
EMERALD LAKE was hard to ride in the early stages, chased on the inside into the far turn, entered the stretch two wide and finished willingly for the show.
EXACTLY WENDY stumbled slightly at the start, angled to the inside, had to check when put in tight around the first turn, moved closer leaving the
backstretch but lacked room into the far turn and lost some ground, tipped out to the two path and lacked a bid in the final furlong. SMILIN EVIE set the pace
under pressure, dueled leaving the second bend, lost command entering the stretch and weakened down the lane. PRECIOUS INSIGHT rated in the two
path then moved out to the three path, asked around the far turn and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
BIG TALKER tracked the pacesetter in the two path, angled out leaving the far turn, reached the front in midstretch and drove clear. IF ID TOLD YOU
settled inside, saved ground to the lane, tipped out at the top of the stretch, lacked room approaching the eighth pole, then gained a clear path and finished
well to earn the place honors. ANITANEWMERCEDES sped to the front while fighting the rider a bit, continued to race a bit rank while moving clear, dueled
with a rival while in the two path on the far turn, clung to a short lead entering the final furlong, overtaken in midstretch and faltered in the final sixteenth.
STANDING O stalked along the inside, lacked room behind the leader and had to pause into the far turn, remained inside to the stretch, lacked room in the
lane, never finding a clear path but kept on for a minor award. WORSE READ SANCHEZ was rank in the early going, traveled outside a pair of rivals,
chased three wide into the lane and could not find the needed late kick. TOUCHDOWN BROWN sat off the pace in the two path then between runners,
remained two wide into the lane and made no impact. JACK SIXPACK was closest in pursuit off the inside, bid alongside the leader at the three-eighths
pole, dueled three wide on the far turn, fought to the eighth pole and gave way. HAPI HAPI steadied between rivals early, dropped back and moved inside,
saved ground to the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
DANCE COMPANY sat off the pace from inside, saved ground through the turn, moved out and lacked room to advanced between runners with a furlong
left, angled to the outside, surged late and got up in the final strides. DESERVEDLY set the pace with MEMES alongside, dueled along the inside on the
turn, held a short lead into deep stretch and got run down by the winner in the closing moments. MEMES broke in and bumped rival, pressed the pace from
outside, challenged around the turn, kept the pressure on through the lane, lacked the needed late punch but finished a game third. WALL STREET
TRADER got bumped in the beginning, tracked off the rail, two then three wide on the turn, moved out further in the lane and finished evenly late. CHRIS
FIX broke in a bit, trailed early on, rounded the turn four then three wide, angled out in the lane and failed to find more late. GRANDCONCOURSE GUY was
away well from outside, stalked the top pair to the turn, bid three deep at the quarter pole and weakened in the late stages. GEBO chased two wide through
the turn and came up empty in the lane. GOT CURLY sat off the pace early on, went three into the turn, trailed two wide into the stretch and never made an

QUEEN GODDESS was closest in pursuit of the lone leader early on, closed in around the final bend, took over into the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch
and held safely. GOING TO VEGAS settled outside a rival or in the two path, bid between foes with three-sixteenths remaining, could not match strides with
the winner late and held the place. NEIGE BLANCHE (FR) raced three then between foes, waited for room past the three-eighths pole, driven three wide
into the stretch, rallied late and missed the place. CLOSING REMARKS pulled and steadied off heels first time in the stretch, advanced outside rivals on the
final turn, got bumped entering the stretch and finished willingly for a minor award. KEYFLOWER (FR) was off slow to begin, steadied behind rivals while
pulling entering the stretch for the first time and continued to pull for a bit after, gained ground between foes on the final bend, came out and bumped rival
into the stretch and finished willingly in the furlong grounds. CARPE VINUM traveled wide down the hill, rounded the clubhouse turn in the three path,
remained wide into the stretch and failed to menace. CHARGES DROPPED settled on the inside, tipped out in upper stretch and made no impact. QUIET
SECRETARY sped to the front and opened up a comfortable advantage, held a diminishing lead approaching the quarter pole, lost command into the
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SYNTHESIS chased on the inside, bid inside the leader at the three-eighths pole, kept the pressure on into the final furlong, finally took over with a sixteenth
to go and prevailed over the runner-up. CALIFORNIA STREET dropped back early, advanced inside rivals while moving to the two path, came out on the
turn and entered the lane four to five wide, closed well and got up for the place. FENESTRA set the pace up the backstretch met the bid from SYNTHESIS
on the inside at the three-eighths pole, maintained a short advantage into the furlong grounds, relinquished command at the sixteenth pole and was
outfinished for second. FIGHT ON chased between foes leaving the backstretch, was box in behind the leader at the seven-sixteenths pole, angled to the
inside around the turn, moved out in the stretch and finished evenly late. I'M CORFU chased four deep to the turn, took aim three wide entering the stretch
and flattened late. CHARGE CASH forwardly placed three deep, lost ground and came four wide into the stretch and weakened down the lane.
HEARTFULLOFSTARS was off a bit slow to begin, traveled three then two wide on the turn and never got involved. SLAM DUNK SERMON was off slow to
start, traveled four to five wide on the turn and was never a factor. FOREMAN broke a bit slow, chased outside a rival from off the pace, went four wide into
the turn, angled down to the two path while trailing the field and tired.
