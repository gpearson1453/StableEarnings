Footnotes
DEFENDER outrun in the early going inside, continued back into turn, steered out five wide into the stretch, briefly rank and lost action upper stretch, was
righted and challenged soon after, drew clear under firm handling. TOWN CHAMP veered out at the break but came out with the leaders, pressed the issue
up front three wide, vied past the furlong marker inside the winner, could not match strides with that one late, proved game for the place. YODEL E. A. WHO
with the pace in the two path and between rivals, dueled through the turn in the two path, held the advantage past the furlong marker but could not contain
the winner, outkicked late for the place position. CAVE RUN lacked speed off the inside, came five wide and behind the winner into the stretch, improved
position slightly while not a serious threat to the top three. LONG TERM THINKING raced behind the first flight in the two path, came up empty for the drive.
SILVER MOON ROAD broke alertly, narrowly showed the way closest to the inside for four furlongs and faltered.

Footnotes
ROLL DINERO ROLL close up from the start, pressed the leader from the outside up the backstretch, took over late in the turn, shook well clear in upper
stretch, held the runner up comfortably safe late under steady handling. CATS GOTTA CHANCE behind the leaders while inside, continued to save ground
through the turn, rallied up the rail to annex the place. JACKYS BACK void of early foot, began to advance between horses midway on the turn, three wide
and in some traffic entering the stretch, continued to steadily advance, not enough late for the place. POINT BLANK back off the pace and the inside early,
got out a bit late backstretch, raced three out to four wide through the turn, improved upper stretch then flattened out the final furlong. WARNING LABEL in
mid pack and off the inside, briskly roused late in the turn between horses, steered out to tighten up and bother MO HAWK MAN exiting the turn causing
that one to steady, went evenly through the stretch. OTHER TIMES ran off for three furlongs post parade, broke a step slow, moved inside, saved ground
turn, improved position while continuing up the rail through the stretch. HOWL YEAH fell back to trail after the start, remained sluggish up the backstretch
and through the turn, improved position toward the rail stretch. MR. WULLY BULLY broke back, was never dangerous while racing three wide. FULL BUCK
MOON in mid pack while along the inside for a half, failed to respond. BACKGATE RED was always outrun while racing four wide. MO HAWK MAN
forwardly placed for a half off the inside, gave way. PACIFIC HARBOR broke sharp, set or forced the pace along the inside for four furlongs, stopped.

Footnotes
KUCHAR broke in, in the second flight while three wide through the first turn, continued outside and moved closer while remaining in the three path late in
the second bend, drifted past the furlong marker to see that progress stall, lugged in under a right handed crop when moving to challenge again with a
sixteenth remaining to lightly brush with the runner up, dueled to the wire, gained nod. CHILENO broke sharp, was clear before a quarter, moved to the
inside, showed the way up the backstretch, responded when challenged far turn, dueled into the lane, shrugged off that foe inside the furlong grounds, light
brush, late duel inside the winner, nipped. DEPUTY CONNECT settled in the second group inside the winner, was moving with that one into the far turn
when blocked, fell back while continuing inside, moved out when straightened for home, along for the show while not a threat to the top two. VIGANO
forwardly placed inside into the first turn, moved out and stalked that one up the backstretch, moved to challenge far turn, dueled into the lane, faltered the
final furlong. BONNE CHERE off a step slow, was four wide into the first turn, moved inside to save ground when still back through the second turn, failed to
muster a rally. ALYANAABI hesitated at the break, remained back in failing to menace.

Footnotes
INTERSTATEDAYDREAM tracked the leader while racing in the two path and under firm restraint, moved on that one in the second turn, dueled into the
stretch then kicked strongly clear before gearing down late to win ridden out. WARRIOR'S BATTLE took command past the wire the first time, rated in
showing the way up the backstretch, briefly responded when the winner came alongside midway on the second turn, proved no match in the drive, clearly
second best. ANNAGANGSTA in the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, proved no threat to the top pair in the drive,
narrowly prevailed for the show. BIG JAVA raced off the pace and the inside, continued back into the far turn, improved three wide through that bend, failed
to sustain that advance in the drive, outkicked for the show. ZAZZY ZAZZY DAZZLE lacked speed, raced three wide into the lane, had little in the way of a
closing kick. CUPID'S MUSIC raced within striking distance on the outside in the second flight, had little for the drive. DARE ME steadied at the break when
in tight to be off a step slow, saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
MISS YUM YUM pressed the issue early while between foes, continued to apply pressure the middle half outside the leader, bid, took over from that one
entering the stretch, clear past the furlong marker then held that same rival save late under steady handling. BURROW DOWN showed the way into the first
turn after clearing to the inside, set a pressured pace up the backstretch and into the far turn, headed into the lane, fell a bit further back past the furlong
marker, switched out and was trying to come back on the winner late, clearly second best. KEEN CONTENDER void of speed while inside, continued to
save ground second turn, also switched out for much of the drive, finished with good determination to earn the show. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE broke back,
raced four wide through the first turn, continued outside and was four wide again into the far bend, managed a good gain into the lane, flattened out a bit to
be outkicked for the third spot. ONLY SHOW IN TOWN forwardly placed through the first turn three wide, continued within striking distance for five furlongs
and began to weaken. RAINBOWS ARE FREE last away, raced back and off the inside, improved a bit into the lane then went evenly to the wire in lacking
a closing punch. PONTIFFANY four wide through the first turn, remained outside, five wide into the lane, had little left for the drive. BEYOND THE HYPE in
mid pack early, was finished after a half. PURRFECT MISTRESS five wide through the first turn, began a steady fade after a half.

Footnotes
VERRAZANO FIRST prompted the leader from the outside in the run up the backstretch and into the turn, crept a bit closer late in the bend, dueled into the
lane, wore that same foe down inside the furlong marker while fully extended to prove best. PLANE TALK broke on top, set the pace along the inside,
responded when challenged by the winner exiting the turn, gave ground grudgingly to that rival. CABOT forwardly placed, dropped inside midway on the
turn, finished up best of the rest while not a serious threat. FIRERY TALE lacked early foot, ranged up to loom a threat four wide turning for home, flattened
out a bit in the drive. AMERICAIN JOEY moved up after breaking toward the back, three wide through the turn, went flat through the lane in lacking a closing
response. COAL TRUTH raced in mid pack and inside, came in the two path for the drive, lacked a closing kick. CALIFORNIA SWING remained back in
failing to menace. SACRED OATH broke near the rear, was always outrun while racing four wide. CHICORY BLUE last away, finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
MARKET ANALYSIS in the second flight early while between foes and under restraint advanced on the two leaders far turn, challenged three wide midway
on that bend, dueled into the stretch, drew steadily clear while being left to pressure. BACKGROUND pressed the early leader off the inside, dueled the
middle half in the two path, put that rival away just as the winner was challenging in the second turn, dueled with that rival upper stretch, proved no match
late, held sway for the place. WELLS BAYOU broke on top, showed the way into and through the first turn in the two path, dueled the middle half while
closest to the inside, began to weaken late in the final turn, managed to save the show. BEAVER HAT off a step slow, moved up to race in the second flight
while three wide, floated out a bit to be four wide midway on the final turn when moving closer, resumed an even running style down the lane in lacking a
closing punch. SONNEMAN void of speed off the inside, steered to the outside turning for home, came up empty. MY SIXTH SENSE lacked speed while
outside, three wide both turns, failed to muster a closing response. TAISHAN steadied when in tight along the rail into the first turn, continued to save
ground to no avail.

SISAWAY NOW off the pace while racing well off the inside, floated out four wide late in the turn, roused when straightened for home, finished with good
courage to be up in time while drifting in slightly late. MAXIENFINN prompted the issue early up the backstretch, dueled through the turn in the two path,
garnered a larger advantage past the furlong marker, drifted out to help bother outer rivals, outkicked by the winner in the final strides. MEAN JAKEY came
in to bump BE THERE just after the start, raced in mid pack just off the inside through the turn, steered out late to bother an even running SLIM MAN then
was bothered in turn when put in tight quarters in the waning strides by MAXIENFINN, finished up willingly. BLAME ELI off a step slow, void of speed, trailed
for a half inside, steered out for the drive, improved position with some belated interest. SLIM MAN in the second flight toward the inside early, came out a
bit late in the turn carrying a couple of rivals out, was going evenly in deep stretch in traffic with bothered, continued to race one paced to the wire and lost a
position late. IMPROBABLE JOURNEY moved up inside to duel backstretch, continued to vie through the turn, began to weaken past the furlong marker
then lost several positions late. COLD CITY lacked speed while racing three wide, made little impact through the stretch while encountering some traffic late.
GHAALEB'S BIG WIN raced off the pace outside, four wide into the turn, floated out a bit wide late in the bend, came up empty for the stretch run. BE
THERE bumped early by MEAN JAKEY, raced in mid pack for a half and tired. FOLLOWING CLAIMS OF FOUL BY THE RIDERS OF BOTH SLIM MAN
AND MEAN JAKEY AGAINST SISAWAY NOW AND MAXIENFINN FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM SECOND AND PLACED FIFTH.
