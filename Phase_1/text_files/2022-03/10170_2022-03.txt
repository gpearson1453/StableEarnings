RELENTLESSLY eager, exploded. APOLLITICAL REDFLASH no match for runaway. JUICE IS LOOSE carried out by foe. JK WILDCAT RED drifted in
late. EL CAMINO CL shut off at wire. JESS ROCKET MAN in tight midway. WIEBURG not enough late speed. WATCH HIM B FAMOUS squeezed out
early. JESSLIGHTNINGLEGS lost path late. DASHIN APPROACH altered inward. DE LAURENTIS bid, backed out.
