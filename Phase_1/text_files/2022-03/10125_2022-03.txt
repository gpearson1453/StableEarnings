FREE SPEECH sprinted up the inside to make the lead shortly after the start, set all the pace while never asked and won as his rider pleased. MY MAE
DAY trailed into the stretch, swung wide, circled rivals and got up for second. PAT DADDY allowed to settle, finished with good courage in the four path.
PRETTY STORMY well placed, failed to respond. BIG TRIP pressured the winner two wide early, chased that one until mid stretch then faded. WIZARD
WILLIE was no factor.

MANNFORD stalked the early pace, circled rivals three then two wide through the stretch and was along in time. GALACTIC battled for the lead along the
inside until deep stretch, altered course outside the winner nearing the wire and finished second best. JUDGE HEAD went evenly. OAKS HONEY best his
stride late. SEND ME ON failed to menace. REANIMATE matched strides for the lead two wide into the stretch then weakened. OFTEN ENOUGH trailed.
