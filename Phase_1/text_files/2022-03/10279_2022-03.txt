WAKE UP CALL bobbled at the start, dueled for the lead with CAPTAIN SCOTTY while racing three-wide, drifted out to bump that foe through the lane and
gamely prevailed. CAPTAIN SCOTTY disputed the pace with the winner while racing four-wide, was bumped repeatedly by the winner in the drive but
finished willingly. ALL AMERICAN HERO showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
BRAZEN NOW was hustled along to track the pace of DRISKILL from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the fore nearing the
three-sixteenths and was ridden out to the wire. DRISKILL sprinted clear soon after the start, was no match for the winner after going a half but held on well
to save the place. JOKERIN chased the leaders while racing three-wide, finished with late interest but failed to gain on the winner late. WIND RIVER was
void of early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a factor. LA CAPRICHOSA showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and
did not reach contention.

MOONLITE GRAHAM sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch, increased his margin into the
lane and was fully extended to hold VINTAGE KITTEN safe late. VINTAGE KITTEN lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and
finished with a steady rally. HEIR (FR) broke sharply to race closest to the winner throughout, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished with a
steady bid. RONAMO settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. CERNAN settled off the leaders
early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. LAUNCH PAD was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and
did not menace. MAKE ME BLUSH lagged throughout, saved ground and did not offer a bid.

CURLING SECRET was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and drew
off with complete authority. DAREABIGDREAM settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. MR LOVE
MUFFIN disputed the pace from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. PRETTY LOUD showed no early speed,
raced four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. HASTA LA VISTA was void of early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and finished
evenly. IMAROYALFLUSH settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. FROG WALKER showed brief speed and
weakened. DON DANIEL was void of early speed, raced eight-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ANY GIVEN NITE raced off the leaders from the
inside and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
BIG BLUE NOTE was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and held QUEENS
RANSOM safe late. QUEENS RANSOM settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and finished with a steady bid. SMOOTH RITHMS
disputed the pace from between foes and gave way through the final furlong. DAZZLING MIST vied for the lead from the inside and gave way after going a
half. MIST OONA B was off slow, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and did not offer a bid. ADRIENNE'S
PROGENY was void of early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BARBARIUS showed no early speed, raced eighth-wide through
the turn and did not reach contention.

LILA'S LUCKY LADY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the first turn, raced three-wide through the second turn and wore
down IKNOWYOURFACE in the final yards. IKNOWYOURFACE sprinted clear at once, was well rated through the back-stretch, remained in control
through mid-stretch but could not resist the winner late. STARLIGHT TWIST showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the first turn, moved four-wide
through the second turn and finished with good late energy. WILLING TO BURN was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and
finished evenly late. BONITA RAPIDS was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. MONGOLIAN EMPIRE settled
off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened. SHARMEL was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the second
turn and did not offer a bid. TWIRLY GIRL showed brief speed, weakened and was eased through the lane.

MISSCZECH was away in good order to duel for the lead with ONEFINEDAY while racing three-wide, disposed of that rival after going three furlongs and
drew off through the lane. WHISTLING HOME was off slow, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in
mid-stretch and finished with a steady bid. ADDYDIDIT chased the leaders while racing three-wide throughout and finished willingly. ROSES FOR
SUZZETT raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. FIRST PROMISE appeared hard to rate, lacked early foot,
raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. I AM YOURS showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
SECRET HAVEN was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ONEFINEDAY broke sharply to duel for the lead from the
inside and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
MISTY MATT dueled for the lead from the inside, responded when challenged by MISS REBEKAH nearing the quarter, vied with that rival and edged away
late. MISS REBEKAH broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing the quarter, vied but could
not match strides late. O SHUGAH MINT was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane and finished
with a late bid. TAHOE BLUE veered in soon after the start, raced just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the
drive. ROCKSIE HARTBRAKER settled off the leaders early, moved eighth-wide through the turn and failed to rally. LOTSA LENA disputed the pace with
the winner for a half and weakened. TEQUILA RITA was off slow then allowed to settle early, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. GOTCHA
JENNY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not threaten. LIL' MISS MISCHIEF steadied soon after the start, raced three-wide
through the turn and did not offer a bid. WICKENBURG showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERING THE STEADYING OF LIL' MISS MISCHIEF SOON AFTER THE START AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS
CONCLUDED TAHOE BLUE HAD VEERED INWARD AND CAUSED THE INFRACTION AND WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED
NINTH.
