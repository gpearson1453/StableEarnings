DEPARTURE stalked the leaders while racking five-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin with a furlong to
run and drew off with little need of urging. SEBASTIAN'S BOY raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the
stretch, was no match for the winner but finished well to gain the place. ASTRONOMICAL was off a step slow then raced just off the leaders from between
foes, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. NUMEROLOGIST was off a step slow then was forwardly placed early, moved
four-wide through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished evenly. CAUCUS RULES was away in good order, opened a clear margin before going a
quarter and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
DARNQUICK broke sharply to duel for the early advantage with STONE CARVER, vied with that rival through a vigorous drive and prevailed in the closing
yards. STONE CARVER dueled for the lead with the winner from the inside through a prolonged drive and gave way grudgingly to that rival late. RACE
HOME was off a step slow, settled off the leaders from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn angled out further into the stretch and finished full of
run. GREEK GEEK raced off the pacesetters early, moved up from the inside to gain a contending position, could not reach the top pair in the drive but
finished with good courage. SOMETHING SUPER was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. TAKE CHARGE
DEPUTY was off a step slow, showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. UNLEASH THE BEAST was reserved just off
the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, offered a bid into the lane but was not urged and gave way.

Footnotes
LOOPY was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command into the stretch and quickly drew off. JEWEL AZUL settled off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further approaching the stretch, angled back in with a furlong to run and was up for the
place. BIG STRETCH was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, advanced four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a quarter to run, drifted
out slightly and yielded. PRANCE was never far back, raced four-wide through the second turn, steadied nearing the quarter and failed to gain in the drive.
ALLIE'S PAL sprinted clear at once, appeared hard to rate and weakened after going three-quarters. FANCY GI GI tracked the leaders from the inside and
weakened after going a half. THE RIDER OF PRANCE LODGED AND OBJECTION AGAINST BIG STRETCH AND THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AND
INQUIRY CONCERING THE STEADYING OF PRANCE NEARING THE QUARTER AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE.

ZERO DOWN was away in good order to duel for the lead with TENGO SED while racing three-wide, edged away from that rival in the final sixteenth and
held off the closing REDDISH to prevail. REDDISH was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the
stretch and was gaining on the winner late. BEAR BRIAN lacked early speed, raced between foes through the back-stretch, moved four-wide through the
turn,, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. TENGO SED disputed the pace with the winner throughout and gave way through
the final sixteenth. TRACK BOUND was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. OXBOW PARK lacked early
foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a belated bid. A GEM IS A GEM was void of early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. HANDSOME ACCOUNT lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not menace. FLOYD
MONEYMAKER lagged throughout, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
THIRD WHEEL pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the half, opened a clear margin into the stretch and was
ridden out to the kept to task. THIRSTY KISS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the
stretch, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. MINNESOTA RED checked nearing the seven-eighths marker, lacked early foot,
raced five-wide through the second turn and rallied late when clear. PRETTY LOUD jumped heels nearing the seven-eighths pole, moved up three-wide to
offer a bid nearing the half, gained a brief lead and gave way in the drive. TRAPALIS was void of early speed, saved ground through the second turn and
finished evenly. BEL RAGAZZO was taken back at the start, checked nearing the three-eighths pole, moved three-wide through the second turn and did not
menace. SHADYFIED was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the quarter and failed to rally. TOLUI set a
pressured pace from the inside and weakened after going a half. AWEZEE showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a
factor. DON DANIEL showed brief speed and weakened.
