EXTREME FORCE vied inside for the early lead, shook free on the turn, responded when roused, pulled away in the lane and was kept to the task. E T'S
SUPER STAR raced off the pace, two wide, came three wide into the lane, rallied near the inside and finished well for second. RUN HAPPY STAR stalked
outside, moved up four wide on the turn, rallied into second and was outkicked for that spot. JACKS AMERICAN PIE vied between rivals for the early lead,
chased the winner on the turn, weakened and just held on for fourth. EXPLAIN was steadied at the start, raced off the pace inside, closed belatedly inside
and just missed for fourth. THE METHOD raced two wide off the pace, failed to threaten and passed tired ones. MR. TUTTLE vied four wide for the lead,
chased on the turn and faded. MAJESTIC SKY vied three wide, chased on the turn and faded. I'M BLAMING YOU chased the leaders and gave way.

B B'S ROCKET stalked the pacesetter outside, moved clear briefly in midstretch then just lasted when inside rival came again. CALL THE PO PO set a
clear pace along the rail, was collared after half a mile, rallied again and just missed. IOVA dropped back outside, remained wide and closed the gap too
late. GOING GOING GONE prompted the pace early then pursued the top pair before tiring. BOLD'N NAUGHTY lacked speed along the rail and was never
in contention. MONSTER RISING raced within range early and began fading after a quarter mile. LAUGH IT OFF dropped back after the start and trailed
throughout.

PUMPERNICKEL dwelt at the start losing about five lengths, recovered and caught up to the field at the half mile marker, advanced on the turn, angled out
at the top of the lane, closed willingly, took charge at the furlong marker and drew off under urging. ONE PAIR OF HANDS dueled between rivals for the
lead, dueled two wide on the turn, led into the stretch, dug in gamely and was no match for the winner. CUP OF LIFE raced off the rail, off the pace, chased
on the turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly. BAI BAI SAMURAI raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the turn and weakened. HOLD
ME CLOSER dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and faded. ARDEAN dueled three wide for the lead, chased three wide on the turn and faded.
GUNS UP raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor.
