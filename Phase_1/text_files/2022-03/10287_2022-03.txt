after, an drew off on her left lead. SHEZA HOT FLASH set the pace inside of rivals early on, drew clear of them into the turn, shifted off of the rail turning for

inner foe in upper stretch, and failed to bid. LANDRY KYLE chased three wide and from between horses, but faded. LADY ABIGAIL stalked four wide, but

SEXY SOCKS set the pace inside of a vying foe around the turn, shook clear of that rival entering the lane, and drew off. COLD AS YOU pressed three wide
early on, chased the leading pair under steady urging around the turn, then stayed on mildly while hanging on her left lead to reach place in the late stages.
RUN A FIRE vied for the lead two wide, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart entering the lane, tired on her left lead through the stretch, and
was caught for place late. SHE'S SO SMARTY tracked in the two path around the turn, then chased along the rail through the lane without progressing.
SWEET STORMY ELLE tracked in the four to five path around the turn while failing to keep pace with the leaders, and tired on her left lead. SHE'S GOT
CHROME was outrun.

Footnotes
BELLA BLU stalked in the four to three path around the first turn, bid for the lead outside of GEORGIANO around the far turn to vie between horses, inched
an advantage from that foe entering the lane, held a margin through midstretch while hanging on her left lead, then shifted inwardly passing the sixteenth
pole, put that foe in tight quarters in the process, and held from an outer rival late. SKIPPERLITTTLEGIRL raced at the rear in the seven to five path around
the first turn, made an early move down the backstretch to press the pace three wide around the far turn, failed to keep pace with an inner foe entering the
lane, but kept on late as that foe drifted, completed a re-bid approaching the wire, but missed. THE ONE FOR FUN tracked in midpack in the three to four
path around the first turn, then was caught five wide chasing the leading trio around the far turn, but managed to stay on late. GEORGIANO set the pace in
the three to two path while clearing entering the backstretch, met a pair of rivals' bids around the far turn, got headed at the quarter pole, fought on through
the lane, but was bested entering the final sixteenth, then steadied when put to tight quarters soon after. MARKANTONY'SQUEEN laid off of the pace along
the inside, chased outside of the leading trio turning for home, but flattened out between horses in the final furlong. SAVE THE DAY was outrun. FAVORITE
SISTER stalked along the inside, but was outmoved by outer foes at the half mile pole and faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, BELLA BLUE
WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOURTH.

pair from the four to five path around the turn. LAKE SENSE broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, set the pace while being pressed by the
eventual winner, got headed approaching the lane, then gave way in upper stretch. NORMALENORA was bumped by an inner foe into an outer rival at the
start, trailed, cut the corner entering the lane, and improved along the rail. HEY SISSY laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, shifted to the six
path in upper stretch, but failed to factor. SWIFTY DAWN took up a bit while in tight quarters between horses at the nine sixteenths pole, took the turn three
wide while off of the pace, and made little impact. WHO'S MY GIRL tracked along the inside, but tired between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
YOU SEXY BOY chased three wide, bid at the quarter pole, gained an advantage at the furlong grounds, drew clear while hanging on his left lead, and
lasted from an outer rallying rival late. SALT CREEK KID tracked in midpack in the three path, but was held up behind foes into the turn, split rivals around
the turn, tipped to the five path in upper stretch, rallied in pursuit of a clear YOU SEXY BOY through the final furlong, but missed reaching that foe late.
FOGGY RIVER prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses turning for home, but was outkicked in upper stretch, and chased. MESTA PARK broke
outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, set the pace, met a pair of bids approaching the lane, resisted until the furlong grounds, but was gave way
thereafter. WHIP stalked along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch, but lacked a rally while hanging on his left lead. THAT'S SOMETHING was bumped
and pushed outwardly by an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and
moved up. CHARLIE MO took a bump from an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path, and failed to factor. BECKETT'S LUCKYDAY was
outrun. FRIGERATOR laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the lane, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
MAN U set the pace inside of a vying CATALE STORM, got headed by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, but regained an advantage entering the lane,
then held between bidding rivals through the late stages. CANEY'S GHOST tracked three wide and between horses, chased entering the lane, gained in the
final furlong in hopes of making a late bid, but did not have enough to reach the leader while prevailing for place. HE'S MUNNIE stalked along the inside,
chased along the rail in hopes of producing a bid in the final sixteenth, but did not have enough to reach the leader, and lost the photo for place. CATALE
STORM pressed two wide, vied around the turn, led at the five sixteenths pole, but was re-headed entering the lane, and yielded between horses on his left
lead. ONOMATOPOEIA tracked four wide, but lugged inwardly in upper stretch and failed to bid. NOSBOR laid off of the pace in the five path, and failed to
factor. SEDARIS raced off of the pace in the four to six path, and made little impact. WILL KNOWS was outrun.
