Footnotes
MACHISIMA raced the widest trip both turns, rallied outside to go clear late in good fashion. MI ENLACE tracked pace from three wide, ran on in the stretch
for place. BEARS BREECHES tracked from inside, made a bid through the stretch but weakened on rail in the stretch run. EUROPA dueled from two path
to deep stretch but also weakened in the late stages. LA CUMPARSITA showed inside speed to duel, stayed to deep stretch but faded in the final furlong.
TAMI ANN never really menaced. CROWELLA always trailed.
