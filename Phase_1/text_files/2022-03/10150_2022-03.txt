Footnotes
DUCHESS BUBBLES pressed the pace off the inside, dueled into and through most of the final turn, disposed of that rival turning for home, kicked clear,
kept to task with steady handling. FORTUNA ADIUVAT within striking distance off the inside, continued in the second flight the middle half, ranged up closer
three wide and outside the winner late in the final turn, proved no match for that one in the drive, far clear for the place. LITTLE BURRITO broke well, set the
early pace inside, dueled far turn, gradually weakened through the stretch, saved the show. FLIRTATIOUS SMILE in the second flight while racing off the
inside, closer four wide turning for home, failed to sustain that advance in the drive, came up empty for the drive. MILLIGANMIKEANDME last away, four
wide when off the pace through the first turn, moved toward the inside in the second bend, lacked a closing response. MERLIN'S SISTER fell back to trail
after the start, remained always back to be outrun.

Footnotes
SIMONA'S CHOICE within striking distance off the inside, continued to stalk three wide into the turn, lost some ground late in the bend, roused when
straightened for home, late push to be up in time. FLASHY BIZ broke back, lacked speed, angled out five wide turning for home, finished willingly to be in
time for the place. GRAPEVINE broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch, continued to set the pace through the turn, drew out to a larger
advantage past the furlong marker, faltered late and failed to contain the top two. ITSY BITSY BETTY chased the leader outside that one for a half, could
not keep up in the drive. WICKED STREET settled in mid pack, raced in the two path out of the turn, lacked a closing response. LIFE OF SATURDAYS
back off the pace between foes into the turn, came four wide and in traffic turning for home, failed to rally. LUTESCOOT N BOOGIE in the second flight
along the inside, saved ground to no avail. UNHERDOF last to leave, lacked speed well wide, four path into the turn, five wide by midway on the bend,
improved a bit into the lane then flattened out. CAGED BEAR void of speed, remained back in failing to threaten. FULLY AWARE raced in mid pack early,
began to tire before a half. PURE SILK finished early, trailed home.

LADY SHAMAN closest to the early leader, three wide turning for home, took over then held that same rival safe late. SAPPHIRE ROYALTY broke in good
order, set the pace into the turn while in the two path, moved to the rail late in the bend, surrendered the advantage to the winner nearing the furlong
grounds, proved stubborn to the end, clear of the others. MY BOSS LADY off a step slow, raced well back in trailing early, swung widest for the drive,
finished willingly to be clear of the others. SPURWINK LANE in the second flight while between rivals early in the turn, saved ground into the lane, lacked
response. BEAUTY DAY broke alertly, within striking distance outside, four wide early in the turn, two path exiting, had little left for the run to the wire.
HOPING FOR A RING back off the pace and the inside, four wide midway on the turn, faded through the stretch. DONT FLOAT THE ICE forwardly placed
in the early going inside, stopped before a half, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in, bled, vanned off.

Footnotes
JILTED BRIDE allowed the pace to go early, four wide into the far turn when beginning to advance, took over in the three path entering the stretch, quickly
clear under a pair of right handed crop strikes, geared down late to win ridden out. MISS IMPERIAL took command soon after the start, set the pace toward
the inside, shrugged off nearest pursuer when headed midway on the final turn to regain the advantage, offered little resistance to the winner in the drive,
narrowly lasted for the place while gaining the nod. BOBBIN TAIL in mid pack while off the inside, came four wide out of the final turn, displayed some late
interest to narrowly miss the nod for the place. LAVENDER (IRE) last to leave, lacked speed, saved ground into the lane, improved position. BLESSED
AGAIN closest to the leader off the inside, briefly put a head in front midway on the final turn then faltered in the drive. TUCKYOURTALEANDRUN broke
alertly, raced forwardly early, began a steady fade before a half. BEACH FLOWER trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
COULD YOU broke on top, set the pace under restraint and off the inside, two path into the lane, moved out a bit further when straightened for home,
maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under a moderate hand ride to win ridden out. GIRLS A BULLET last to leave, lacked speed well out in the
strip in the run up the backstretch, steered in a bit early in the turn, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improved into the lane then flattened out a
bit in the late going to lose the place. HONEY PARADE within striking distance outside, continued to maintain contact with the leader through the turn in the
four path, had little for that one the final furlong, narrowly gained the nod for the show. SHACKLEFORD COUNTY chased the winner in the three path,
roused for the drive, could not match that same rival through the stretch, weakened a bit late and was outkicked for the second spot. FLATOUTANDFOXY
broke back, raced four wide throughout, lacked a serious closing response late. COURTLY in mid pack while saving ground, in some traffic late in the turn
while remaining along the inside, lacked a response when clear for the drive. MARY ALICE settled along the inside behind the pace, backed up through the
stretch. HIT IT TWICE trailed throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
ONE TEN STADIUM settled off the early just off the inside, worked way out to three wide midway on the turn, came five wide into the lane, late burst down
the middle of the strip to be up in time. PEACE DOG behind the pace while saving ground, tipped out a bit for the drive, late bid inside the winner and
between foes, not enough for the win, in time second. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER away well, edged clear into the turn, larger lead when straightened for
home and past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner. WHERE'S RANDY last to leave, lacked speed, moved out and raced four wide through the
turn, moved a bit closer into the lane then raced flat through the final furlong. KINFOLK fell back after the start, got out midway up the backstretch, trailed
through the turn, picked off some tiring rivals while not a serious threat. AFLEET SKY chased the leader three wide for a half then weakened in the drive.
OJITOS in the second flight while racing in the two path, tired in the drive. ONEIGHTHUNDREDCASH was finished early, trailed home to be well beaten.

Footnotes
TIZ RYE TIME in mid pack and off the inside between rivals, advanced three wide far turn, took over in upper stretch, drove well clear. JAY VEE BEE
closest to the leader three wide into the first turn, continued to pursue up the backstretch two off the rail, moved to engage the leader as the winner was
challenging late in the final turn, proved no match for that one, clearly second best. BEACHWALKER lacked speed, advanced along the inside second turn,
steered out for the drive, rallied for the show, no threat to the top two. CALIBRATE one paced while racing just off the inside, continued in the two path
between foes second turn, lacked a closing response. MINE OWN STAR sprinted clear to set the pace along the inside, faltered when headed by the top
two turning for home. AMONGST FRIENDS saved ground to no avail. GALACTIC EMPIRE settled behind the pace outside, four wide into the far turn, tired
in the drive. RIVER REDEMPTION was never involved.

CADDO RIVER closest to the leader while settling nicely, continued to stalk up the backstretch, advanced and challenged from the outside late in the final
turn, shook clear, steady handling. WAYAKIN moved up after the start to set the pace, rated in the run up the backstretch, responded when the winner came
alongside late in the final turn, dueled into the stretch, could not keep pace the final furlong, remained clear of the others. FAN CLUB settled behind the
pace while just off the inside first turn and between foes, remained within striking distance while saving ground through the second bend, eased out a bit for
the drive, slowly getting to the runner up while also no threat to the winner late. HARVARD in mid pack while racing outside, continued three wide onto the
backstretch and through the final turn, lacked a serious closing kick when called on for the drive. SALOW five wide into the first turn, continued off the inside
while pulling onto the backstretch, failed to menace. YOU'RE TO BLAME last away, raced outside and was never a threat while four wide through the
second turn, lacked response in the drive. GAME DAY PLAY rank while behind the pace inside, began to be eased into the far turn after moving outside,
distanced, jogged in, walked off. ALLEGE lacked speed, remained back off the pace while off the inside second turn, pulled up stretch, vanned off.

UNCLE MO'S CAT closest to the leader, moved at will on that one in the second turn, quickly clear, steadily clear while being kept to pressure. MO BETTA
angled in to save some ground first turn, settled in the run up the backstretch, lost some position late in the second turn, roused for the drive, battled back to
earn the place, no threat to the winner. STRIKE A BEAT broke out and set off a chain reaction of interference, was straightened to race behind the pace,
three wide through the final turn, closest to the winner past the furlong marker, outkicked for the place spot. CHASE TRACKER fell back before a half,
outside, four to five wide late in the final turn, improved position while not a threat to the top three. SOUTHERN RAGS off a step slow, four wide into the first
turn, continued outside, four wide again in the second turn while still one paced, continued evenly through the lane. JUNESANDRA slammed at the start
then checked up, back early, made little impact while racing toward the inside. KNIEVEL broke in, bumped soundly, remained back off the inside. ALPINE
GHOST broke on top, sprinted clear to set the pace, continued to show the way up the backstretch, weakened when headed in the second turn. FAY DAN
slammed at the start, in tight, trailed well wide, eased second turn, jogged in, walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE
START, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
