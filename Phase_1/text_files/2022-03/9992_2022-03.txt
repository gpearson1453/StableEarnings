Footnotes
PHARAOH FANCY PANT tracked off the first flight outside rivals to the backstretch, split foes three wide nearing the far turn, continued with a steady bid to
challenge for command on the far turn, went clear into upper stretch and was kept to firm encouragement while widening. NIP OF BOURBON, urged to the
lead along the inside racing to the backstretch, conceded the lead once challenged approaching the far turn, then produced a second effort inside rivals
racing into the stretch to prove best of the others. TIZ TRIUMPHANT, in touch with the pacesetter prompting that foe in early stages, was urged to bid
between rivals racing into the far turn but flattened out in upper stretch. DOHKO settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and
continued evenly. WILSHIRE DIAMOND, rated along the inside in early stages, made some brief progress to advance near the inside racing to the second
bend but came up empty in the drive. YOU'RE IN COREY flashed brief pace three wide racing to the backstretch but gave way early.

Footnotes
TOUR FOR GOLD broke readily, angled to the inside while being urged dictating the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, forged clear racing
through the far turn, widened under some left handed pressure and was taken in hand nearing the wire. ONLY GIRL tipped outside the pacesetter racing to
the first turn while being urged to prompt that foe into the backstretch, couldn't maintain terms with that rival racing through the far turn but responded to firm
encouragement to prevail for the place honors. BELLAVALENCIA was rated tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch,
was urged to lodge a brief, three wide bid nearing the far turn, continued under pressure into the lane in that path but proved empty in the drive.
SERENDIPIA, roused in early stages, soon retreated.

LIVEFORTHESONG was rated along the inside stalking the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, tipped out three wide leaving
the midway point of the far turn while continuing with a steady bid, moved to challenge in that path racing through upper stretch and went clear late under
firm encouragement. MIDNIGHT RAID tracked just off the pacesetter between foes in second flight to the backstretch, advanced to press just outside that
foe racing through the far turn, dueled between foes midstretch and prevailed for the place honors while failing to contain the winner. REMEMBER THE
TUNE sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage just off the rail through the backstretch,
shifted to the inside on the far turn dueling for command inside foes past midstretch but yielded to the top pair late. ACTION DREAM, pulling a bit against
restraint inside foes, switched outside foes racing into the backstretch dropping off the second flight, angled back to the inside nearing the far turn but lacked
the needed late bid. NAVY KING tracked the pacesetter three wide in second flight in the opening half, then gave way racing into the far turn. ONE COOL
DUDE hopped at the start, settled last to the backstretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CYBERVIKING was urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, edged forward nearing upper stretch and went clear under firm
urging and some right handed encouragement. TRIPULANTE angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch into the turn,
proved no match in the last quarter but was clearly best of the others. MIL DOSCIENTOS angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes on the
backstretch, tipped out on the turn while being prompted to advance, drifted out racing into upper stretch and lacked the needed late bid while prevailing for
a share. MY WAY OR NO WAY tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight in early stages, shifted out four wide racing into the lane, but
offered no rally. ONE LUCKY DAY broke in the air losing position to his rivals at the start, switched outside foes to race three deep in the second flight on
the backstretch but faded racing into the turn.

Footnotes
ASCENDING MOON was rated between foes off the second flight racing to the first turn, was carried out a bit by LET'S TRY AN ALIAS approaching the
backstretch, conceded some ground to let that rival shift outside, then angled inwards to race between foes through the backstretch, was prompted to
advance while shifting out four wide leaving the midway point of the far turn, steadily closed the gap on the pacesetter and edged forward of that foe in time
under firm left handed encouragement. BOURBON BROWN was urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail to the backstretch, held sway on a clear margin to
upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid but proved only second best. SHIPWRECK, reserved outside foes leaving the chute, angled to the rail when
presented an opening racing into the backstretch, saved ground into the far turn gaining some position, tipped out four wide racing into upper stretch and
continued well enough to edge a rival for a share. CREATIVE CHOICE tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight from the outset into the far turn
and faded into the stretch. RAMIRIN, off last, was settled outside foes to the backstretch, was prompted to advance five wide racing through the far turn to
upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. PRINCE AMADEUS tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight from the outset to the far
turn and faded racing into the stretch. JOHNNIE GOT JETS, caught four wide racing to the first turn while gaining terms with the second flight, dropped back
while shifting inwards on the backstretch and never menaced thereafter. RAGING WHIRLWIND, caught in close quarters racing through the chute, was
reserved inside foes to the backstretch and never gained contention. MANUKA BOBBY tracked the pacesetter three wide in second flight for five furlongs
and steadily faded racing through the far turn. LET'S TRY AN ALIAS, pulling hard against restraint while shifting to the inside leaving the chute racing
behind the second flight, continued to fight restraint on the first turn, switched out four wide when presented an opening racing into the backstretch and soon
gave way.

Footnotes
HOT AND HEAVY, urged between foes, then along the inside pursuing the leaders into the turn, came through inside the leaders nearing midstretch to
challenge for command and prevailed in time under pressure. HIGHLAND PARK HERO, in touch with the leaders three deep attending the pace on the
backstretch, pressed the issue in that path into upper stretch challenging for command but came up second best. GUNMAN, bumped at the start, settled off
the second flight racing through the backstretch, split foes three wide midstretch gathering late momentum and prevailed narrowly for a share on the wire.
MR LIGHTNING BOY tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing into the turn, angled four wide racing through the stretch but lacked the needed final
kick. GEMO settled outside foes racing to the turn, was fanned five wide entering the stretch and continued to gain some position while making no real
impression. STRIKING HEIR broke outwards bumping GUNMAN at the start, was quickly righted, then urged between foes prompting the pace, dueled into
upper stretch and gave out abruptly leaving the furlong marker. ARAZI LIKE MOVE, bumped at the start, settled last along the inside on the backstretch and
failed to menace thereafter. NOTORIOUS NICK broke outwards bumping ARAZI LIKE MOVE, was righted, then urged inside rivals disputing the pace
through the backstretch into the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, then maintained the advantage to the end under firm handling. SANDY LANE KITTEN, urged inside foes
disputing the pace in the opening stages, conceded the lead to stalk the pacesetter along the inside to the backstretch, switched outside the leader racing
into the stretch while being urged to advance but couldn't gain even terms with the winner. OBIWAN was rated behind rivals in second flight along the inside
in the opening half, saved ground on the far turn and steadily improved position inside foes to prevail for a share. YES SIR ROBERT was rated tracking just
off the leaders near the inside racing to the backstretch, continued between foes in second flight racing to the far turn, shifted out three wide entering the
lane and was outkicked for a share. LORD BARNA, reserved off the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued evenly to the stretch. DREAM LINER
(BRZ) was rated off the second flight outside a rival in the opening stages, made brief progress to gain some position three wide after a half, but came up
empty nearing the lane. BRING ME A CHECK, forwardly placed three wide racing to the first turn, continued just outside the pacesetter pursuing that rival to
the far turn and gave way. HYPE MAN, reserved along the inside in the opening stages, proved no threat. KRAMDEN dropped out early.

came through inside foes when presented an opening racing into upper stretch to bid for command midstretch and edged forward late under right handed
pressure to prevail. CARROTS OR CARATS, in touch with the first flight three wide pressing the pace racing to the turn, shifted in disputing the issue past
midstretch, resisted the winner's bid but was outfinished. THE SKIPSTER tracked off the first flight outside the eventual winner racing to the turn, shifted out
four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, continued to press the issue to late stages but was outkicked by the top pair. EL GUAPO
broke inwards bumping KAPHAVATA, angled to the inside while being urged disputing the pace through the backstretch, dueled for command while shifting
off the inside entering upper stretch and gave way late. KAPHAVATA ducked in at the start, tracked off the second flight racing to the turn, swung out
nearing the lane but had no late bid. O DANNY BOY, bumped by EL GUAPO at the start, settled into stride, switched out nearing the lane and passed some
tiring rivals. CHAIRMAN FOX, off slowly, was settled outside foes and proved no threat. HIS WILL BE DONE dropped out early. BAHAMIAN DUDE angled
inwards while being urged between foes pressing the pace and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
ALBIE, reserved along the inside racing well out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling to the far turn, saved ground
to upper stretch, then produced a steady late response to advance inside foes to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. ROBINSON was rated
between foes racing well off the leaders to the backstretch shifted out five wide racing through the stretch while making steady progress late but was
outkicked. GOLOVKIN rated just off the pacesetter between foes leaving the chute, shifted to the inside entering the first turn tracking the pacesetter under
rating, saved ground into the far turn, tipped out entering the stretch while being urged to challenge for command between foes but was outkicked by the top
pair. VINTNER tracked off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the far turn, then continued between
foes in that path to the lane but lacked the needed late kick. JO JO KATZ settled last racing to the to far turn, swung out six wide in upper stretch and made
a mild gain. OSPREY was rated along the rail tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight leaving the chute, but was shuffled out of tight quarters
racing into the first turn, switched out racing to the backstretch while being prompted to advance three wide between foes nearing the far turn, continued in
that path into the lane but flattened out late. MR. SARCASTIC, reserved along the inside, tipped out to race between foes on the far turn to the stretch but
had no rally. SPIRITUAL KING, urged to the lead along the inside, maintained a clear margin to the stretch and gave out abruptly in the closing stages.
BUC'S INVESTMINT tracked off the second flight outside foes and faded early. KING ANDRES, urged to a forward placing tracking just outside the
pacesetter in the opening half, gave way between foes racing into the far turn.
