Footnotes
SMILING SALSA moved up inside to set a pressured pace and held on gamely. BUBBAS STREET GAL pressed the pace while racing along the rail, bid
willingly to contend, couldn't get by the winner and finished second best. DOWNTOWN CUTIE pressed the pace, went four wide between horses on the
turn, fell back and went evenly late. GYPSY WOMAN broke slowly, rallied outside on the turn, went ten wide at the top of the stretch and closed steadily.
LADY M was never far back, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed late response. MISS REBEKAH got away alertly, pressed two across to
the turn and flattened out. MIDNIGHT BABY broke slowly and trailed the field.

B J'S SPIRIT settled off th epace, rallied on the turn to challenge, dueled for the lead and drew clear late in a driving finish. STREET SHADOW advanced to
the turn, bid inside, didn't have enough late and finished second best. RED VENUS raced mid pack, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and closed to
get up late for show. JEWEL AZUL was in tight on the first turn, bid off the rail on the second turn, shifted out and caught for third. LEMON DROP LADY
raced close to the pace, went six wide entering the stretch and hung late. LEXOPHILIA was outrun in an even effort. FORTHELOVEOFLYDIA sprinted clear
to set the pace and gave way mid stretch. FABULOUS FORUM lacked a response. Hand timed.
