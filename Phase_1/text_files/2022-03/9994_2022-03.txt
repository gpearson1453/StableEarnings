Footnotes
LUCKYINKENTUCKY no rush to far turn, rallied under confident handling while widest into stretch coming fast all out in time at the wire. KILLER BEE good
position throughout, rallied outside, led in the stretch but nailed on the wire. GOLDEN TEXT speed to the front, stayed well to the stretch, lasted for third.
CARDIAC KID raced evenly to the stretch run and was along mildly too late. INDIANA RED had head turned and unprepared start, trailed to the half and
only improved late. MR. BANYAN four wide into first turn, pressed pace to far turn but gave way in the stretch. MR. FLATTERY close up inside to the half
but gave way readily thereafter. SETSON never in contention.
