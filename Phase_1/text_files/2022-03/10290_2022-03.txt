early pace then went evenly. TV TIZ GORGEOUS failed to respond. NOT JIMMY'S TOY was no threat. I'M JAC'D pressed the early pace two wide and was

much the best while taken in hand late. MISSION GIRL unhurried early, rallied through the stretch in the five path and finished well clear for second.
PARFAIT unhurried early, passed tiring rivals in the three path. BUSYBEING FABULOUS failed to menace. RONNI'S DAY pressed the pace along the
inside into the turn then gave way. ANGEL WINGS raced widest early and was always outrun. PAYTON PRETTY was hustled along two wide to set the
early pace, had speed until deep stretch then stopped. SCARLETT'S AWISH had brief speed.

Footnotes
THURSDAY FROST sprinted to a clear lead before a quarter, set the balance of the pace unchallenged won as much the best. MINE ALONE unhurried
early, swung wide, rallied through the stretch outside and finished clear for second. HOSANNA stalked the pace and went evenly. SCOOBY ROO was
hustled along, chased the winner until deep stretch then faded. PRICEY APPEAL had brief speed. INDELIBLE IMAGE was no factor. HIDDEN PRIDE was
no threat. PROPHETESS was fractious in the gate prior to the start and trailed.
