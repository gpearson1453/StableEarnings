RACK DADDY unhurried early advanced to collar rival at the quarter pole extending from mid track down the lane needed all to edge clear late. HARD TO
ACCESS sent clear set the pace holding daylight through the backside then was hooked from the outside nearing the quarter pole battling back in upper
stretch ceding grudgingly at the end. PRINCESS CELESTE raced evenly through the backside edging up to contend on the far turn chasing through the
lane lacking more late. LONGDRINKOFWATER folded up on the far turn. CUPP OF CLASS stalked the early pace then wilted on the far turn. PAINTED

GOOD IDEA prompted the pace dueling on the far turn wresting a short lead inside in upper stretch digging in gamely from the rail late. ROYAL DRAGOON
was steadied between horses near the seven eighths pole, stalked close up through the far turn looming in upper stretch giving a final push to draw almost
even abreast rival at the wire. MR. HALFTIME went evenly through the backside rallying to pressure on the far turn vying outside rivals at mid track down
the lane. C F V WICKED RED gave a mild middle move racing evenly through the far turn finding late action to close the gap. CENTSOFWANDER played
no factor. GRAND DEAL pressured the early pace then folded on the far turn. BUNDLEDLIKE BERNIE done early was eased to wire.

Footnotes
MAGIC MOUNTAIN broke sharply to the top drawing off on the turn finding more down the lane being ridden out. NIGHT TIME RULER chased a loose
leader through the turn then down the stretch proving a clear second best. INSACIABLE PRINCE slow early raced evenly to upper stretch mustering
enough there to best the others. CAPTAIN BERNARDO a step slow early through managed to outbid a few down the lane. EVASIVE ACTION slow early
played no factor. PASSIONATE LUCK was never involved. WILDCAT CROWN raced mid pack tiring down the stretch. HIKE'S DREAM chased early then
gave way along the inside down the lane.
