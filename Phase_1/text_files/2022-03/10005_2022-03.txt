Footnotes
LIL RICKYS JEWEL with the second flight while saving ground early, shifted out on the far turn, responded under right handed urging in the five path to
make the lead past the eighth pole and finished full of run to win going away. TURBO POWER pressed the pace two wide for a half, made the lead, quickly
opened a daylight advantage on the second turn, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. MARCH MAGIC unhurried early, found
his best stride late in the four path. THANKSDAD away alertly, set the early pace along the inside, chased the pace into the stretch then gave way readily.
CARSON'S ROCKET bumped at the start and had brief speed. DEVINE PRIDE bumped at the start and offered little. VOLUME LEADER was bounced
around between horses at the start, had speed for a half, stopped and was eased to the wire.

mid stretch when struck with a right handed whip, was bumped by that one nearing the wire then outfinished. BULLION went evenly in the six path. UNCLE
MOMO pressed the pace along the rail into the stretch, was bumped near the furlong marker then faded late. SOUTHERN SPIRIT sprinted to the lead two
wide soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the turn, had speed into the stretch then stopped. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT

Footnotes
JUJU NINETEEN pressed the pace two wide into the turn, dropped inside the leader, made the lead at the top of the stretch and proved best under right
handed urging. FLYING GUILLOTINE never far back, swung wide, rallied determinedly near mid rack and got up for second. DONDADA sprinted to the lead
soon after the start, set a pressured pace in the two path to the top of the stretch then was outfinished. ELEGGUA pressed the early pace four then three
wide until deep stretch then was. FED BIZ THE KIDD pressed the pace three wide into the stretch then faded late. NIGHT TIME RULER failed to menace.
ROYAL FROCK had brief speed.
