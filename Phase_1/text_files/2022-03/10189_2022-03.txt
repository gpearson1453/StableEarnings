Footnotes
ABHITA unhurried in the early going, trailed into the far turn while patiently ridden, roused with a quarter mile left to run, angled out into the clear and surged
to the front past the sixteenth pole. BARRISTER'S RIDE stalked the pace from inside, between foes leaving the backstretch, lacked room behind
GHOSTEM through the far turn and upper stretch, tipped out approaching the eighth pole, rallied strongly late but could not get by the winner. BUSKER
ALLIE stalked the pace outside a rival then three deep at the seven-sixteenths pole, bid three deep and took control in upper stretch, led clear into the final
furlong, drifted out and yielded to the top pair in the final sixteenth. ELA CALIMERA MOU sat off the pace early and moved to the inside, went two wide into
the far turn and lacked room at the five-sixteenths pole, shifted out into the lane and finished evenly. TIZ MY PRINCESS settled on the inside early, moved
off the rail and went three then four wide on the far turn and could not rally. GHOSTEM vied between foes early then dueled outside COMMAND ANNA,
inched ahead to take control leaving the backstretch, battled into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. SHE'S A BIT
SASSY hopped at the start, rushed up outside the top pair first time through the stretch, pressed from outside up the backstretch, remained alongside the
leader on the far turn and between rivals into the stretch, steadied off heels in upper stretch and gave way. COMMAND ANNA broke a bit slow then bobbled
at the start, vied for the lead from inside, lost touch leaving the backstretch then got shuffled at the three-eighths pole, dropped back around the turn and
tired.

Footnotes
STORMINSIDE stalked the top pair off the rail, went three wide through the turn, drew alongside nearing the eight pole and drove clear. SPEED PASS
dueled for the lead outside PRINCE RICKY, cleared that rival with a quarter mile left to run and moved in a bit, challenged by STORMINSIDE nearing the
eighth pole, could not fend off the winner and held the place. PRINCE RICKY dueled for command from inside, got put in a bit tight at the quarter pole and
lost touch with SPEED PASS, kept to task through the lane and stayed on for a clear third. TROMADOR lacked early speed, rounded the turn two then
three wide, angled out into the lane then drifted out in the stretch and passed tired foes. TWO PUNCH CAT chased along the inside, lost ground around the
turn and failed to respond. SURPRISE FASHION broke slow, chased off the rail through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BYE BYE BERTIE pulled early while off the rail then sat off the pace in the early going, asked three wide on the far turn, took over quickly and cleared in
upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth, threatened by TOURNESOL in the closing moments but was able to hold on. TOURNESOL sat off the pace,
traveled outside a rival up the backstretch, asked three wide on the final turn, tipped out into the lane, rallied steadily through the stretch and missed.
CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE unhurried in the early going, raced along the inside then tipped three wide into the lane, went between rivals in upper stretch,
showed a mild rally but was not enough. MERCY MERCY took control early and moved to the inside, set the pace up the backstretch, dueled around the far
turn and lost command with a quarter mile left to run, then weakened down the lane. RAPID TRANSIT was rank early and pulled to a forward position first
time in the lane, settled into stride and was closest in pursuit to the outside of the leader, bid into the far turn, dueled around the bend and took control at the
quarter pole, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. KLEEN KARMA was off a step slow from outside, altered out crossing the dirt, went up to be
forwardly placed first time through the stretch, raced in range outside a rival into the lane, lacked room in upper stretch, tipped out to a clear path and could
not rally. BADGER KITTEN got shuffled early and became a bit rank crossing the dirt behind the leader, settled into a stalking position from inside, saved
ground to the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MARIE raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter early on, bid three wide at the quarter pole, took over at the top of the stretch and kicked clear to win
going away. BONITA LEONA broke alertly from outside and cleared the field, steered inward and set the pace two wide into the turn, challenged by MARIE
with a quarter mile left to run, lost command at the three-sixteenths pole and stayed on to prove second best. SUE ETTAS GHOST lacked early speed,
navigated the turn four then three wide and got up for third. LILA AT THE BEACH hit the gate and came away a bit slow from inside, chased behind the
leader along the rail, saved ground to the stretch, flattened in the lane and lost the show.

Footnotes
MUBTADAA dueled from inside to the turn, vied with a pair of rivals around the bend, cleared midstretch and held well in the closing moments. ADMIRAL
HALSEY broke well then dropped back early, angled to the inside and made progress along the rail, had the rider take hold at the half-mile pole then again
into the turn to avoid running up on heels, waited for room around the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, rallied and edged TRAINER PLEASE for
second. TRAINER PLEASE drifted in and bumped rival early, attended the pace from outside, vied three deep around the turn, fought to the eighth pole,
could not kick on with the winner and got edged for second. DANIEL'S MAGIC unhurried in the early going and steered to the inside, roused nearing the
quarter pole, tipped three wide leaving the turn, summoned a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta. NAISMITH dueled for command from outside, vied
between rivals around the bend and weakened in the stretch. FAMOUS STAR broke a step slow then recovered quickly showing early speed, got bumped
from outside and shuffled back early, floated out by rival entering the stretch and could not rally. IRISH PROPHET leaned back and was off slow, raced
three then four wide on the turn and failed to menace. THE GIANTS CANDY broke slow on the outside, raced off the pace three wide around the turn and
failed to make an impact. TAKE ACTION was off slow to begin, raced outside a rival, angled to the rail on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
BRICKYARD RIDE took control early and set the pace down the hill, drew away in upper stretch and held safely to the wire. INDIAN PEAK bobbled at the
start, raced between rivals into the turn, gained ground around the bend and came four wide into the stretch, altered out from behind rival at the top of the
stretch, rallied in the final furlong but had to settle for second best. RIDING WITH DINO came away slow, angled to the inside and traveled off the pace,
exited the turn three wide, angled out in the lane and gained the show. WHOOPING JAY pulled the rider along early then stalked the lone leader three to
four wide around the turn and lacked the needed response in the lane. BIG FISH trailed early off the inside, came five wide into the stretch, improved
position in the lane while failing to threaten, bled following the race and walked off. FASHIONABLY FAST broke well from outside, was closest in pursuit two
three wide down the hill and weakened in the lane. SACRED RIDER unhurried in the early going, went three deep into the turn, steered to the two path
around the bend then moved out nearing the stretch and never got involved. JETOVATOR hopped slightly at the start to come away a bit slow but quickly
recovered, stalked the pace on the inside through the turn, propped and jumped the dirt and could not regain momentum in the lane.

Footnotes
PARK AVENUE broke well and established the front quickly, set the pace on the inside, given his cue with a quarter mile left to run, kicked away in upper
stretch and remained strong to the wire. NEW HEAT broke slow, trailed early on the inside, tipped two wide on the far turn, angled out into the stretch and
steered widest in the lane, closed strongly through the final furlong and was geared down when unable to threaten the winner late. STELLA NOIR came
away well then pulled early first time through the stretch, was closest in pursuit in the early stages, got floated three wide leaving the second bend and kept
on to earn the show honors. MOONLIGHT D'ORO stalked the pace from inside, tipped two wide on the far turn, flattened in the lane and held on for a minor
award. SHORE BREAK (IRE) bobbled leaving the gate, tracked in the two path before angling four wide at the quarter pole, moved out further in the lane
and shared a minor award. BUBBLES ON ICE (IRE) off slow in the beginning, steered to the inside while near the back, saved ground to the stretch and
never threatened. MORAZ stumbled leaving the gate, settled outside a rival, bothered by rival at the five-sixteenths pole and angled inside that foe, came
three wide into the stretch and could not rally. CALIFORNIA KOOK pulled early on the inside, settled in mid-pack up the backstretch, chased inside into the
lane, tipped out in the drive and flattened out. HOGANS HOLIDAY traveled three then two wide around the first turn, raced outside a rival up the
backstretch, trailed three wide into the lane and never threatened.
