Footnotes
RAIN came in a bit at the start and pushed CANDY'S DREAM into NOBLE INTENTIONS, stalked the pace in the three path, took over near the quarter
pole, vied outside of BEAUTY QUEEN through the lane and prevailed. BEAUTY QUEEN set the pace in the two path, dug in inside of the winner when that
foe wrested a short lead near the quarter pole and fought on inside through the stretch. TIME TO TWO STEP stalked the pace in the four path and was no
match for the top two in the lane while outfinishing a foe for the show. VITAEMI had some speed between foes, steadied and dropped back near the
three-quarters pole, saved ground in range, angled three wide approaching the quarter pole, lacked the needed rally and was outfinished for the show.
CANDY'S DREAM was pushed in and soundly bumped NOBLE INTENTIONS soon after the start, chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the
lane. CHEZ PAREE was outrun outside. NOBLE INTENTIONS hit the starting gate, was bumped hard soon after, raced two wide and was never in
contention.

Footnotes
HEIR TO THE ROAR saved ground hemmed in behind the leaders around the turn, stayed on the rail getting clearance once straightened away for the
drive, responded well and edged clear late. LITTLE BELITA was never far back, advanced to loom a threat three wide nearing the stretch, bid through the
furlong grounds and ran on with good courage. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH broke a step slow, raced two to three wide in the second flight to the stretch, and
rallied mildly. TWIN CAUSE raced evenly through a ground-saving trip. ARETE'S CHALICE set a pressured pace inside, and weakened through the last
eighth of a mile. MOCLIPS was edgy in and around the gate prior to the start, lacked speed and never factored. MAGNOLIA ROAD was outrun early, came
four wide off the turn and could not gain. ALBA MIA pressed the pace two wide, and gave way after three furlongs. GRAN MAMIBELLA moved up a bit four
wide on the turn, but could not sustain the rally.

Footnotes
KODAMA (IRE) bumped with rival at the start and raced just off the early leader, chased after FULTON MARKET around the turn, came under left handed
pressure in the upper stretch, stayed on determinedly and got up late. MISS SAKAMOTO tracked the top two leaders into the turn, hustled along three wide
in the upper stretch, steadily edged up closer, finished with good response and captured place. FULTON MARKET broke on top and sped to the lead,
cleared and angled inside, widened to a clear advantage still racing in hand around the turn, came two wide into the upper stretch, held clear a furlong out
then yielded and got overtaken late. BALI BABY bumped with rival at the start and chased the pace into the turn, was ridden along four wide into the lane
and showed interest without threatening the top trio. NEVER (IRE) was off a step slow at the start, raced in the back through early stages, came three wide
into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. VIALETTO chased two to three wide and failed to move into close contention. OXOMOC raced off the
pace, saved ground into the lane and never threatened. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED, RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
PENETANGUISHENE set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. CHEROKEE CHATTER settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled five
wide in upper stretch and rallied for the place. FOR EVER OURS bumped with INDIA PILAGA at the start, chased the pace four wide, lacked a rally and
stayed on to hold the show. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) bumped with FOR EVER OURS at the start, prompted the winner two wide and weakened in the lane.
CODE NAME LISE chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. WIN OR CELLAR failed to menace while racing four wide. TURN IT ON stalked
the pace three wide and tired in the drive. SENORITA SALSA had her head turned at the start, saved ground and made little impact. BELLE'S KINGDOM
played no factor while racing three wide. MISS MAMBA bobbled at the break, lacked speed in the three path, had the rider lose the whip near the quarter
pole and lacked a rally while lugging in through the stretch. TONIGHT MAYBE was outrun while racing two wide.

PIRATE LIFE saved ground outrun early, came three wide into the stretch beginning to find stride, shifted out in front of PARTNER'S HOPE leaving the
eighth-pole, and surged late to overhaul the leaders from outside. DETERMINED FURY vied outside BIG DADDY DAVE from the outset, got the best of that
dispute turning for home, and stayed on stubbornly inside the top two finishers. CRACK SHOT tracked the battling leaders around the turn, bid outside
through the lane and was outfinished between horses. BIG DADDY DAVE dueled inside DETERMINED FURY for three-eighths of a mile, and weakened in
upper stretch. PARTNER'S HOPE raced three to four wide around the turn, and was going evenly outside when bothered slightly by PIRATE LIFE just past
the furlong marker. NO QUE NO was outsprinted early despite hustling tactics, and remained at the back. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE. FRACTIONS ADDED AND FINAL TIME CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
OMIXOCHITL tracked the top pair along the outside through the backstretch, came under a ride three wide around the turn, stayed on determinedly through
the lane and edged away near the sixteenth pole. NEBULI vied out of the chute then edged back to stalk the early leader, moved back up to challenge
PRINCESS CUPID for the lead mid-way around the turn, dueled gamely into the final furlong, began to edge away from aforementioned foe then got
overtaken by the winner. PRINCESS CUPID vied for the lead out of the chute then cleared on top and led the way into the turn, took on the challenge from
NEBULI with five-sixteenths left to run, fought back gamely from the inside into the final furlong then lacked closing response. QUEEN CAMILLA settled
outside off the early pace, was ridden along five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. ICE LOVE raced two wide off the early pace, tucked
inside around the turn and failed to respond when called upon. CHESS NOT CHECKERS raced in range just off the inside through the backstretch, came
up empty near the quarter pole and retreated in the lane. HANNITA'S EMPIRE dropped back after the half and jogged in.

Footnotes
PARKLAND pressed WEIGHT OF GLORY from outside, took over entering the far turn, spurted away from PREFECT after six furlongs and widened under
a mild drive. PREFECT tracked inside to the far turn, moved out to the three-path with aim at PARKLAND at the top of the lane, could not muster a serious
threat and ran on best of the others. AL HILAL broke slowest, moved off the inside leaving the first turn, came five wide from the back approaching the
stretch, and rallied to go clear of the remainder. RED FLAG ALERT was strung out four wide on the turns, and posed no threat. QIAN B C raced three wide
in range for six furlongs, and faded. PROPENSITY pit in a mild run three then two wide approaching the stretch, but could not sustain the rally.
NEVERSTOPDREAMING lagged well back early, lacked room on the rail approaching the stretch, and remained in arrears. KING THEO raced forwardly
three then two wide early, and tired before reaching the stretch. THE PREDICAMENT was no factor two to three wide. WEIGHT OF GLORY set the early
pace inside, could not match strides with PARKLAND into the far turn, and gave way. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
