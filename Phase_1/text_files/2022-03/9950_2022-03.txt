Footnotes
SUNDAY SCHEMING rushed to set the pace inside of a prompting WINNING QUALITY, drew clear of that rival entering the lane, and lasted from an outer
foe late. BLONDIE LOX BABE tracked along the inside, grinded away inside of rivals through midstretch, shifted outside of the clear leader while claiming
place at the sixteenth pole, gained to produce a late bid, but missed reaching that foe on the wire. WINNING QUALITY prompted the pace outside of the
leader, but failed to keep pace with that rival entering the lane, chased thereafter, but lost place to an inner foe a sixteenth from home. CAVE CREEK
chased the top pair from the outside, and then evenly through the lane. BELMAR BEAUTY achieved midpack position early on, but lost ground into the turn,
raced two wide and between horses around the bend, then stayed on mildly without threatening. ALTERED DREAM saved ground off of the pace, but to no
avail. KONA KATIE laid off of the pace three wide, and never got involved. LOVE AND LEMONS trailed throughout.

MOMENT OF STARDOM tracked along the inside, smoothly tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane, rallied through midstretch as an outer
BATTLE OF WILL did the same, bid at the sixteenth pole, led soon after, and kept his outer counterpart at bay. BATTLE OF WILL bumped an outer rival at
the start, rated off of the pace while tucking from the three path to the two path around the fist turn, held that path before tipping five wide entering the lane,
rallied outside of foes in midstretch, attempted a late bid in the final sixteenth, but was denied while reaching place. BIG SCULLY prompted the pace two
wide, vied turning for home, led at the three sixteenths pole, drove clear soon after, but was bested by a pair of outer rivals in the final sixteenth.
EVERLOVINGHAND set the pace inside of a prompting rival, got headed by that foe at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened on his left lead thereafter.
SCORING DRIVE broke a bit outwardly before being firmly taken in hand and wrangled back to last soon after, trailed into the far turn, gained mildly in the
five path and outside of foes around that bend, but leveled off in upper stretch without menacing. RANCH BADGE tracked two wide and between horses,
moved forward to pursue the leading pair down the backstretch, chased them from the three path around the far turn, but faded between horses at the three
sixteenths pole. HENNING took a bump from an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace while hung out four wide, raced between horses in the four path
around the far turn, and never got involved. BACK ALLEY JAMMIN laid forwardly placed four to three wide, but weakened between horses at the half mile
pole, was through early, and eased through the lane. THE HALF MILE AND THREE QUARTER MILE FRACTIONS WERE TRIGGERED BY HAND.

MRS. JUDY dueled for the lead two wide, then drew off at the quarter pole. CRYPTO BRAVE tracked along the inside, shifted to the three path at the
furlong grounds, and stayed on to reach place in the final sixteenth. TENSAS VIRGINIA dueled inside of the eventual winner, but gave way entering the
lane, and lost place late. STEPH'S SPIRIT tracked from midpack two wide, shifted three wide and outside of MADAME JANE entering the lane, altered
course to the seven path at the three sixteenths pole to remain outside of that drifting rival, then bested that foe leaving the furlong grounds for a minor
share. MADAME JANE chased the top pair from the three path while inside of a rival, but drifted outwardly at the three sixteenths pole while failing to keep
pace with the top two, lugged back inwardly soon after, then continued to wander about while weakening between horses at the furlong grounds. STRONG
CHICK broke a bit outwardly, raced far back two wide, and made little impact. SANDRA'S JUEL sat far back along the inside while a path off of the rail, and
never got involved. SILLY SILLY stalked in the four path, but weakened entering the lane. OUR SOUTHERN GIRL was void of early speed outside of rivals,
then bore out to the outer part of the track at the three furlong pole was eased through the lane, but walked across the wire before walking off.

DENVER CITY managed a loose lead around the turn, and widened handily through the lane. IRISH HOKIE stalked outside of the loose leader around the
turn while being that rival's closest pursuer, and was second best. TWIRLING ROSES tracked along the inside, and claimed show from an outer rival at the
furlong pole. MAY HOUR chased in the two to three path around the turn, but lost show to an inner rival at the furlong grounds. DINAR trailed around the
turn, and failed to factor. IN SKY WE TRUST laid off of the pace in the three to four path, and made little impact. THE QUARTER MILE AND HALF MILE

Footnotes
MISS TULSA broke a step slowly at the start, tracked along the inside, moved to stalk down the backstretch, tipped outside of the leading pair at the three
sixteenths pole, rallied to bid entering the final sixteenth, and edged away late. TELLMEONASUNDAY broke through the gate pre-race, laid close up along
the inside of the leader into the first turn, rated back and shifted off of the rail to stalk around that bend before coming into the backstretch two wide and
between horses, re-engaged the pace setter from the outside at the half mile pole, vied between horses before bidding approaching the five sixteenths pole,
dueled with her inner game counterpart through upper stretch, forged an advantage at the furlong grounds, led into the final sixteenth as MISS TULSA
menaced alongside, but was outkicked by that rival late. SARIAH SARIAH broke through the starting gate pre-race, set the pace outside of a rival into the
first turn, cleared that foe around that bend while staying a path off of the inner railing, tucked in into the far turn before showing the way from a pair of outer
rivals, dug in gamely entering the lane, sustained a duel inside of TELLMEONSUNDAY through midstretch, but gave way at the sixteenth pole. I'M FINE
tracked in the three path, moved forward to press among foes into the backstretch, sustained prompting position outside of the leading pair through the far
turn, but drifted to the four path at the quarter pole, and faded in upper stretch. BELLAMY CAY tracked in the four path around the first turn, moved to press
outside of rivals entering the backstretch, but faded approaching the far turn. CHINATOWN NANCY was outrun.

DELIGHTFUL MOMENT vied inside of a pair of rivals around the first turn, set the pace down the backstretch, showed the way from a single pressing rival
around the far turn, shook clear at the quarter pole, and held firmly to the final sixteenth before beginning to tire late, but lasted safely to the wire. SURELY
(FR) vied along the inside through the lane for the first time, but bore outwardly into the first turn, which allowed DELIGHTFUL MOMENT to slip inside, vied
two wide and between horses entering the backstretch, rated back to stalk from the pocket into the far turn, shifted outside of the clearing leader
approaching the furlong grounds to take aim two wide and between foes, grinded away to bid in the closing stages, but did not have enough to reach the
leader. ELLE OF THE BALL bobbled and bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked two wide, gained outside of the leading pair turning for home, failed to
keep pace with the inner leader while vying for place outside of SURELY (FR) through midstretch, but was outkicked by that rival leaving the furlong
grounds, then saved show from an outer foe on the wire. I'M BLUSHING stumbled at the start, rated off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the
three path before swinging eight wide in upper stretch, then rallied through the final furlong while changing to his right lead a sixteenth out, but surged
belatedly and missed reaching show. COLORS OF THE WIND bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked from midpack along the inside while a path off
of the rail, shifted six wide for clear sailing at the three sixteenths pole, then stayed on mildly between horses, flopped back to his left lead entering the final
sixteenth, and got outkicked for minor placings. COCO PUFF saved ground in midpack, retreated to off of the pace into the far turn, then chased along the
rail while steadily progressing through midstretch, but flattened out late. AMENSET took a bump from an inner rival at the start, tracked in the three to four
paths, and failed to factor. MY FRIEND AMY rated off of the pace in the four path, gained four wide around the far turn to striking range entering the lane,
but flattened out five wide in upper stretch, and tired between horses in the final furlong. SHISHITO (IRE) bumped with an outer rival at the start, settled far
back two wide, got caught in the five path around the far turn before swinging to seven wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally. DIAMANT DAMHSA (IRE)
was carried out and severely hampered into the first turn, prompted the pace three wide approaching the backstretch, then two wide into the far turn, but
failed to keep pace with the inner leader at the quarter pole, and weakened between horses approaching the furlong grounds. JUST A NYQUIST was
outrun. THE THREE QUARTER FRACTION WAS TRIGGERED BY HAND

INTREPID HEART stalked the top pair from the inside, tipped outside of them turning for home, ranged up in upper stretch to bid entering the final furlong,
and drew off. WARRIOR IN CHIEF set the pace along the inside, but was headed by a bidding OURNATIONONPARADE, then outkicked by the eventual
winner approaching the final furlong, but kept on to reclaim place approaching the final sixteenth. OURNATIONONPARADE pressed two wide, bid turning
for home, led entering the lane, then from between horses in upper stretch, but faltered approaching the final sixteenth. LORD DRAGON laid off of the pace
in the four path around both turns, then stayed on without menacing. MY BARILEY trailed into the far turn, and failed to factor. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL
tracked two wide, but weakened into the far turn. COLONELSDARKTEMPER stumbled at the start and dumped his rider, then galloped around with the field
before walking off.

Footnotes
ELLE Z set the pace from a pressing outer GOIN' GOOD around the turn, shook clear of that rival in upper stretch, and held sway firmly from that chasing
foe to the wire. GOIN' GOOD pressed two wide around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, chased resiliently through the lane,
but was second best. CHANGE OF CONTROL had her head turned to the left when the gates opened, hopped and was off slowly, regathered and
advanced out of last into the turn, took the bend in the three path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, bid for show passing the furlong grounds, battled
outside of SAIL ON ELLEN for that position through the final sixteenth, and edged it late. SAIL ON ELLEN stalked along the inside, bid for show at the
furlong pole, vied for that position inside of CHANGE OF CONTROL through the final sixteenth, but was outfinished. ONEROLLOFTHEDICE tracked three
wide, drifted to the four path entering the lane, failed to keep pace with the top two in upper stretch, met a pair of show-bidding rivals on either side at the
furlong grounds, and weakened between them while mildly taken in hand entering the final sixteenth. SKINNY DIP laid off of the pace along the inside, but
failed to factor. ELLE'S TOWN was outrun. THE RIDER OF ONEROLLOFTHEDICE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF CHANGE OF CONTROL
FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG; THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS. THE QUARTER AND HALF MILE
FRACTIONS WERE TRIGGERED BY HAND

MORE MEMORIES took the first turn in the four path and between horses while off of the pace, tracked four to five wide turning for home, rallied to bid
approaching the final sixteenth, and edged clear. OUR BLUE JAY settled off of the pace in the three path, tracked around the far turn, split rivals three wide
in upper stretch, bid inside of the leader approaching the final sixteenth, but was outkicked, leaving that junction. MARTINIZED tracked in the two path,
rallied three wide into the far turn, led turning for home, but was outkicked by rivals on either side entering the final sxiteenth. HOME VISIT vied along the
inside, backed off to stalk entering the backstretch, chased the leaders around the far turn, tipped four wide approaching the lane, but flattened out among
foes in the final furlong. CAMEO DANCER broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, settled far back, took the far turn in the five path, and moved up
late. DRILLING REPORT vied three to two wide, led into the far turn, but was headed by an outer bidder turning for home, and gave way in upper stretch.
COMMANDER SCOTT showed the way between horses into the first turn before an inner rival backed off, but yielded around the far turn, and caved under
no urging through the lane. UNFATHOMED tracked in the three path early on, but faded into the far turn. TOUCHDOWN JOE took a bump from an inner foe
at the start, laid off of the pace in the five path around the first turn, but was done early, and eased through the lane.
