Footnotes
SNOW MAN showed good early speed and drove clear in the final stages. HYPER DRIVE stalked the early pace, raced two wide and was no match for the
winner. AMERIPOINT was unhurried early on, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and moved up late to improve postion. DARE FELIX was slow
early, angled six wide through the lane and showed good late interest. JENNA'S GUN RUNNER settled off the early pace, raced three to four wide and had
no final winning bid. RENVYLE dropped back early, raced five wide around the far turn and never was a factor. ARCHRIVAL raced four wide in the lane and
never had a response. SAMURAI MIKE pressed the pace and gave way. HORSE FLY raced along the inside and never was a factor.

the inside and weakened a bit in the final stages. BOBBY BOOTS broke to outside, settled off the early pace, moved up five wide through the upper lane
and showed good late interest. DOUBLETROUBLE BEAR raced along the inside and had no final winning bid. PACK'N IRON raced three wide through the

HAYDENS HAVOC showed good early speed, raced two wide through the lane and held well to be clear under strong handling. GOTTA LOVE IKE stalked
the pace, made a good rail bid in the drive and got up for the place position. WRATH was forwardly placed, raced three wide in the lane and kept on to the
wire. BRAINSTORM stalked the pace, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and flattened out. MAKABIM settled off the early pace, raced four
wide at the eighth pole and had no response. A P'S BLUEGRASS raced three wide around the far turn and never was a factor. OMEN OF CHANGE
dropped back early, raced along the inside into the lane and never threatened. FORT KNOX was slow early and never threatened. BLABIMIR was coaxed
along early and tired readily.
