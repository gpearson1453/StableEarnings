NEVER COMPROMISE stalked the earlier pace then closed to the front two deep approaching the quarter pole, came under pressure midway on the far
turn, dueled clear in the upper stretch and was kept alert to widen the final sixteenth. BLACK STEEL took the lead leaving the thirteen sixteenths pole and
angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, was caught at the rail approaching the quarter and relented the final
sixteenth. MEGA MILLIONS saved ground off the pace on the opening turn, picked up the chase at the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three
path and showed little further. WIDGET FACTORY rated just off the pace three wide the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but
flattened at the rail on the far turn. POPPY'S TWO STEP raced off the rail on the first turn and showed little response down the backstretch. FRATHOUSE

COMMCAT settled close toward the inside, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced four wide on the far turn, dug in for the lead and drew clear later
yards. DYLADDIE moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, dug in under
steady handling from the head of the lane but was caught later yards. KATALIMA settled off the pace inside on the first turn then eased outward into the
backstretch, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, ran three wide on the far turn and raced evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. TINA'S SONG stalked
from the two and three paths, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, continued close nearest the rail on the far turn then flattened the final furlong.
CHARITABLE MISS was never a factor. WHISKEY TALKING settled off the rail on the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase nearing
the three eighths pole but faded on the far turn. This race was hand timed.

I'D LIKE TO KNOW dueled early and took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the turn and dug in under steady
encouragement to hold on. JAIME JAMEL settled off the early pace inside, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the turn about the three
path, lost some ground leaving the turn but dug in to take second mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner. THEHEATOFTHENIGHT gave chase inside,
raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. YOU CAN NEVER TELL had a brief early lead then gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole,
raced close through the turn but weakened the final furlong. SUSPIROS gave chase well off the rail, rounded the turn about the four path, angled widest into
the stretch and finished evenly outside. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL broke through the gate prior the start then came away awkwardly, gave chase toward
the inside and ran evenly in the lane. TRUTH SERUM chased outside and rounded the turn about the six path. JESS'S RESERVE gave chase toward the
outside and raced in the five path of the turn.
