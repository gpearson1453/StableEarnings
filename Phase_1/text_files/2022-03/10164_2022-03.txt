Footnotes
TETRAGRAMMATON vied early outside LEGAL STAR, cleared off and moved inside showing the way up the backstretch through an even pace, responded
to steady urging through the stretch and remained in command. CATATUMBO raced in easy striking range two wide on the turns, had the rail through the
drive and finished willingly to share second. CARNIVORE pressed the pace outside, fought through the lane between horses and finished willingly to wind
up on even terms for the runner-up spot. SIMMS raced three wide on the turns, advanced to contention after six furlongs, and was outfinished outside rivals
for larger shares. LEOPARDI saved ground early, had the two-path on the far turn, and lacked a bid. LEGAL STAR raced inside through the turns, and tired
after six furlongs. BADBADBOBBY raced three to four wide on the far turn, and failed to menace. STONE AGE was finished early. IRISH KING broke poorly
and was always outrun. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
GOLDEN ISLE sped to the lead soon after the start and showed the way by slim margin, vied inside of SHEZ RECKLESS around the turn, cut the corner
and shook free in the upper stretch, stayed on gamely under pressure and held on in final strides. SHEZ RECKLESS was forwardly placed out of the gate
and moved up behind the early leader, vied outside of GOLDEN IDLE around the turn, could not match strides in the upper stretch but stayed on gamely,
was inching back up to GOLDEN ISLE in final strides but ran out of time. UNCONSCIOUS tracked the top two leaders into the turn, launched a three wide
bid into the upper stretch and sustained response to secure a share. HIGH ARABIAN raced two to three wide near mid-pack in early stages, was ridden
along two wide in the stretch run and improved position without threatening. TWENTY ONE SHORT raced in range along the inside on the turn, tipped three
wide in the stretch and ran on evenly. DOLCE APRILE was off a step slow at the start and angled inside to save ground, was ridden along four to five wide
into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. DOMINANT JOY raced two wide off the early pace, ridden along four wide into the lane and failed to move
on.

LUCKY GIRASOL stalked the pace inside, angled three wide to split rivals in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the lane, rallied between foes
and was up in deep stretch. NURSE JUDY was in range four wide, bid in upper stretch, vied outside of the winner through the lane and just missed.
DRINKS ON ME pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, led to deep stretch and just lasted
for the show. ALIZEE lacked early speed, advanced four wide around the turn, rallied widest and just missed third. AFFICIONADO (FR) chased the pace
two wide and lacked a rally. MS BIG SPRING dueled inside a DRINKS ON ME in the two path and tired in the lane. NOBLE INTENTIONS played no factor
while racing four wide. I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT was outrun inside.

Footnotes
VIVE BIEN bumped with REDDINGTON at the start, sprinted to the front in the two-path, responded whenever HAMMER LANE tried to muster a challenge,
and widened through the lane under pressure. HAMMER LANE prompted the pace outside VIVE BIEN from the outset, could not seriously menace but was
clearly second best. REDDINGTON was squeezed at the break between VIVE BIEN and STAT, then bobbled getting shut off a couple strides later, moved
off the inside on the turn, and was clear of the remainder through the stretch. SMOKEY WHITE raced three wide between horses into the turn, and could not
gain through the stretch on his left lead. STAT bumped with REDDINGTON at the start, and was through early inside. THE MAR was no factor four wide.
BOLD PLAY broke slowly, and showed little trailing near the inside.

Footnotes
BACKWOODS BOOGIE angled in soon after the start, tracked the top pair around the turn, roused two wide a furlong out, advanced to a slim lead and held
on. GRAN MALBEC chased three to four wide near midpack around the turn, set down five wide for the drive, was inching up to the winner approaching the
wire and just missed. JETTIN OUT steadied in opening stages then raced two to three wide in range around the turn, sustained response through the lane
and captured show. BALISTICO was forwardly placed in opening stages then vied outside of rival around the turn, battled on gamely into deep stretch then
yielded in final stages. LIVING VICARIOUSLY took over the lead soon after the start, vied inside of BALISTICO around the turn, fought back into the final
furlong then came up empty. DANI'S VICTORY was ridden along off the early pace, chased two to three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally.
SUNSHINE CHARLIE angled inside soon after the start, chased along the rail around the turn and failed to move on in the lane. MIRACLE SILVER raced
off the pace, came five wide into the lane and offered no late rally. TENACITY ZIP stumbled at the start but still managed to get away quickly then failed to
keep pace and steadily weakened. STANFORD (IRE) raced in the back throughout. TRAINERS OBJECTION JETTIN OUT AGAINST BACKYARD BOOGIE

SPIRIT WIND set the pace along the rail, drew clear around the turn and held clear under confident handling in the lane. ONE IDENTITY chased the pace
three wide, angled into the two path in upper stretch and stayed on willingly to gain the place. STRATEGIC BIRD prompted the winner two wide, could not
keep pace nearing the quarter pole and was outfinished for the place. YOU LOOK COLD broke awkwardly, saved ground off the pace and lacked the
needed rally. OFFALY FAST was outrun while racing three wide. LEVIOSA saved ground off the pace, swung out in upper stretch and had no response.

Footnotes
PEACE OF EKATI pressed BUENISIMO from outside early, challenged midway on the far turn, battled inside MORNING STRIDE entering the stretch, and
would not let that rival get by through a long, hard drive. MORNING STRIDE was strung out three to four wide throughout, reached even terms outside
PEACE OF EKATI turning for home, could not get by and remained clear for the place. BUENISIMO was nursed along on a short lead for six furlongs,
yielded to the top two finishers entering the stretch, and ran on late to hold the show spot. GO MIKE hugged the rail throughout, had room to come on
through inside the leaders at the top of the lane, but did not have enough. DUROCHER trailed in range to the stretch, and lacked the needed closing
response. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

IGLOO broke readily and led the way in opening stages, vied inside of HARPER'S IN CHARGE around the turn, briefly shook free then took on the
challenge of inside running SAMMY'D TOWN, dug in gamely a furlong out, edged ahead and held firm under right-handed pressure. SAMMY'S TOWN
raced along the rail just off the top pair around the turn, cut the corner and moved up to challenge IGLOO for the lead, battled back from the inside past
mid-stretch, could not kick on with the winner but sustained response and held place. DESIGNED BY KITTEN raced three wide in the last flight around the
turn, responded three to four wide in the upper stretch, steadily edged up closer and just missed place. TREVESS raced three wide in the second flight
around the turn, sustained three wide bid into the final furlong and got caught late for show. SARA MIA raced outside of the last flight around the turn, was
ridden along four to five wide into the upper stretch and had a mild improve. MORNING COCKTAIL chased two wide in contention around the turn,
sustained bid into the final furlong then gave way. HARPER'S IN CHARGE vied outside of the winner around the turn then came up empty in the lane.
AFLEET DIVA saved ground to no avail and vanned off after the race. MOON OF LOVE (IRE) raced two wide in the last flight around the turn and offered
no late rally. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE

BRIGHT FUTURE tracked the pace three wide, seized command near the quarter pole and drew off while drifting out under left-handed urging. LOGICO
lacked early speed, raced four wide and stayed on to gain the pace in the final strides. GASOLINE set the pace along the rail, was collared near the quarter
pole, fought to midstretch then weakened and lost the place late. PRACTICAL WAY chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. DUAL
THREAT was bumped at the start, saved ground and never threatened. STRONG LIGHT failed to menace while racing three wide. MACHISTO broke out
and bumped DUAL THREAT at the start, raced two wide and made little further impact. TOUCH CODE pressed the pace two wide for a half, chased two
wide around the turn and retreated through the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
YES I AM FREE pursued WARRIOR'S PRIDE from outside to the stretch, reached the front leaving the furlong grounds, then turned back BELGRANO
through the final yards. BELGRANO stayed close around the turn while awaiting room inside, came through on the fence with a bid through midstretch,
finished gamely inside the winner and narrowly missed. ARREST ME RED was outsprinted two wide for three-eighths of a mile, split horses finding his best
stride into the last sixteenth of a mile, and closed in with late interest. HIGH CRIME saved ground in the second flight early, moved out three wide
approaching the stretch, and gained mildly outside the top trio. OLD CHESTNUT lagged well back three wide on the turn, moved to the far outside and
gained belatedly. CHESS MASTER lacked the needed response three wide. WARRIOR'S PRIDE set the pace to the stretch, and was overhauled from both
sides soon after leaving the furlong grounds. OMAHA CITY was outrun inside. COOL QUEST was no factor two wide. HELLO HOT ROD showed little
trailing throughout. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
PROVOCATEUR bumped with rival at the start then settled nicely three to four wide sitting just off the top pair nearing the turn, let out a notch and moved
up three wide to engage rivals for the lead approaching the quarter pole, dueled with NITROUS CHANNEL to the furlong marker then drove clear and
widened under a steady pressure. NITROUS CHANNEL got bumped between rivals at the start, vied with GOLDEN JUAN into the turn then took on the
added challenge from the winner approaching the quarter pole, fought back into the furlong marker then failed to move on with the winner but sustained
response and finished clearly second best. GOLDEN JUAN bumped the gate at the start then held a slim lead in initial stages, dueled with NITROUS
CHANNEL into the turn then took on the added challenge from the winner approaching the quarter pole, could not match strides in the upper stretch but ran
on and held a share. AMERICAN SANCTUARY raced two wide in range around the turn, tipped four wide for the drive and needed more for late impact.
SPORT PEPPER tracked the pace along the rail around the the turn then weakened in the lane. DESERT RULER chased three to four wide off the early
pace although never far back in early stages then came four wide into the upper stretch and gave way.
