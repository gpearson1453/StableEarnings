Footnotes
KHULUQ veered out at the start then was hustled while corrected by the rider, contested the pace on the outside while in hand, moved to a solo advantage
with five furlongs to run, was asked in the two path midway through the turn, shook off the runner-up into upper stretch, came under a left-handed crop
around the three-sixteenths, drew off under the crop until just outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a solid hand-ride to the wire while much the
best. CULDEE angled out near the three-quarter pole, settled on the outside, moved closer with five furlongs to run, chased in the three path around the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place. POINT PLEASANT was well positioned just off the
pace, dropped back under urging in the two path early on the turn, moved to the rail late on that bend and tired while best of the rest. OH MRS. MAISEL
moved out while settling at the rear, was urged three wide on the turn and came up empty. DOLCE SERA settled off the pace, dropped back and lost
position near the nine-sixteenths, was urged along in the two path passing the half-mile pole, shifted four wide under strong urging at the three-eighths,
turned into the stretch under the crop and failed to respond. ROZ contested the early pace, dropped back with five furlongs to run, came up empty while
inside early on the turn and retreated.

DARE TO BE GREAT dropped back under coaxing then settled on the outside, gained leaving the backstretch, made a bid in the three path with three
furlongs to run, passed the five-sixteenths in front while under the crop, moved clear coming to the quarter-pole, extended the advantage under a
right-handed crop while still on her inside lead until just before the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead, was switched to a left-handed crop
shortly thereafter and given one pop outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a strong hand-ride to the wire while much the best. ELEGANT
LAOBAN was coaxed along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and just got up for the place
while no match for the winner. KEEN DANCER broke out then was quickly corrected by the rider, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the half-mile
pole, went four wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match then lost the place but was well clear for the
show. LIVE IN FIVE showed good speed and set the pace, vied inside while asked for more on the turn, lost the lead before the five-sixteenths, dropped
back nearing the quarter-pole and tired. EMERALD BANKER was urged along at the rear then dropped to the rail, moved out leaving the backstretch, went
three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then drifted in around the three-sixteenths and was no factor. LITTLE MISS MINION moved
up to race just off the pace, dropped back while lugging out some into the turn and capitulated. ALARRA tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back two
then three wide on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
BETSY BLUE prompted the leader three wide outside the top pair, advanced to take narrow command when set down spinning three wide into upper
stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. FIGHT ON LUCY broke out at the start and was corrected, chased five then four wide patiently handled until
set down spinning five wide into upper stretch, kept on to chase the winner home while along for the place honors. RUVIES IN TIME bobbled at the break,
recovered under hustling to and nudged AWILLAWAY from the two path to advance and prompt the leader from between foes, took over narrow and brief
command with five-sixteenths to go, got headed at the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while well
clear for the show honors. AWILLAWAY chased in the two path early on until nudged three wide by the aforementioned foe, tucked inside into the turn, then
got out to the two path under a firm grip, came under coaxing inside the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and tired. BABA hustled from the gate,
showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from a pair, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got displaced from command with
five-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BANK ON ANNA stumbled badly at the start then was taken up, spotted the front several lengths, settled under some coaxing early, moved out under
stronger encouragement around the nine-sixteenths, went three then four wide on the turn, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed strongly to make a bid
into the final sixteenth and got up under strong urging. LEELOO chased the pace on the outside in third position, went three to four wide on the turn,
pursued the pacesetter under a drive into the final furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, reached even terms for the lead about seventy yards from
the wire but just missed while able to get the place. READY A. P. showed good speed and set the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, responded
well when asked for her best into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while well clear for the show. THINKING IT
OVER broke in and bumped soundly with a foe then was taken up, spotted the front a few lengths, moved in while ridden along off the pace, saved ground
on the turn and came up empty. EASY PLAY was hustled from the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn, moved
out outside the furlong marker and tired. THE HONORABLE RUTH stumbled badly at the start then checked, spotted the front many lengths, trailed while
well out in the track, rounded the turn in the five path and was no factor.
