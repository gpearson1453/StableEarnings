Footnotes
BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) tracked on the inside into the turn, had to steady a bit off heels at the three-eighths pole, tipped to the two path around the
bend, surged late and got up in time. NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) set the pace under pressure from outside, shook free leaving the turn, led into the final
sixteenth and got nailed on the line. SILARDI broke well, was forwardly placed inside, saved ground to the stretch, chased within striking distance, finished
willingly late and held the show. NILES CHANNEL bobbled at the start, sat off the pace, went two wide around the turn, angled out in the stretch, split foes
with a furlong remaining and missed the show. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE traveled at the back of the pack, went three wide into the turn, angled down to the
rail around the bend, then showed a mild response to improve placings. HIGHLY DISTORTED raced in range outside rivals up the backstretch, traveled
three then four wide around the bend and could not rally. JAMMING EDDY chased two wide into the turn, angled out to the four path and failed to rally.
POLAR pressed the pace from outside, lost contact with the leader leaving the turn, came three wide into the drive and tired. D K'S CROWN raced at the
back of the field early on, steered to the inside, angled three wide on the turn and made no impact.

IMPOSSIBLE TASK sent from the gate, dueled three then two wide on the first turn outside NO HANG CHARLIE, vied between rivals around the second
bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and held well in deep stretch. RIFEY stumbled leaving the gate, trailed on the inside through the first turn, moved out on
the backstretch, rounded the far tur three to four wide, rallied from outside in the lane but was not enough. NO HANG CHARLIE hustled to the front from
inside, dueled with IMPOSSIBLE TASK through the early stages, battled with rivals around the far turn, fought to upper stretch and weakened in the final
furlong. DOC ADAMS forwardly placed into the first turn and got put in a bit tight between the top pair, pulled and was hard to ride around that bend to early
on the backstretch, settled into a stalking position in the middle stages, trailed two wide into the lane and made no impact in the stretch. ABSOLUTE UNIT
stalked off the inside, bid three deep and vied for command on the far turn, lost touch with the winner approaching the furlong grounds, then was eased in

HONG KONG HARRY (IRE) broke slow from inside, stalked off the rail then moved to the two path, bid three deep on the far turn, took over then cleared at
the eighth pole and won going away. CARMELITA'S MAN raced up close outside the pacesetter, bid two wide nearing the far turn, raced between rivals
then got crowded past the quarter pole, chased the top pair two wide into the lane, then ran on to regain the place. PRINCE MAIOR sped to the front and
crossed over, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged from outside into and around the far turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and flattened to third.
LUVLUV settled in the two path, went three then two wide on the far turn, moved out in the stretch and could not rally. JIMMY P broke slow, tracked on the
inside to the stretch and was not a factor.

WIN THE DAY got bumped between rivals leaving the gate and dropped back to last early, tucked inside on the first turn, steered out on the backstretch,
rallied four wide and drew alongside the top trio with a quarter mile left to run, took over in upper stretch, then drew off in the final furlong. PIROLI chased in
the three path on the first turn, bid three wide into the stretch, could not go on with the winner in the furlong grounds but won the battle for the place honors.
CLASSIC MARK broke out and brushed WIN THE DAY, set the pace on the inside under pressure, vied with rivals on the far turn and carried a short lead
into the stretch, lost command in upper stretch and got edged for second. KEROUAC bumped with WIN THE DAY at the start, went up to press the pace
from outside, fought between rivals at the quarter pole, then weakened in the stretch run. MONGOLIAN BOX sat off the pace three wide early, took the
second turn two wide, trailed into the stretch and tired.

into the stretch, lost command outside the sixteenth pole and fought gamely to the wire. DEL MAR DRAMA stalked from a bit off the rail into the turn, angled
out to the three path around the bend, put in a mild late bid but could not reach the top pair. FI FI PHAROAH broke slow, trailed early well off the rail, chased
four then three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. HEELS UP set the pace inside of SHARAPOVA, lost command past the three-eighths pole, could not

Footnotes
AIR FORCE RED rated outside the pacesetter early on, angled to the rail for the turn, saved ground around the bend, tipped out in upper stretch, reached
the front with a sixteenth to go and edged away. TRAINER PLEASE sped to the front and moved inside, met the challenge from MAGIC MAN around the
bend, shook free from that rival leaving the turn, tested by AIR FORCE RED approaching the sixteenth pole and yielded to that rival. MIGRATION broke
slow, pulled early up the backstretch, took the two path through the bend, drifted inward in the lane and gained the show. MAGIC MAN stalked the leader
outside a rival, bid two wide around the turn, could not sustain the challenge leaving the turn and flattened in the final furlong. NINEELEVENTURBO away
quickly from outside, stalked the pace well off the rail, moved to the three path for the turn, drifted out in the lane and never produced a bid. FLINTMORE
broke cleanly then dropped back off the pace, rounded the turn two wide and offered no response when called upon. TROUBADOUR broke slow, tracked
from inside through the turn and failed to rally. HUNTER JOHN broke slow, was forced to check early, went three wide around the turn and was not a factor.
JEDI MASTER traveled along the inside near the back, went two wide into the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
EDA sped to the front and angled to the two path, challenged from inside at the quarter pole, cleared that rival and inched away in upper stretch, continued
clear into the final sixteenth and held over the late charge from the runner-up. UNDER THE STARS broke a step slow from outside, forwardly placed three
then two wide early, stalked outside a rival up the backstretch, chased three then two wide on the far turn, finished well in deep stretch and kept gaining to
the wire. AIN'T EASY rated behind the pacesetter, put in rail bid at the quarter pole, lost touch into the stretch and flattened to third. DESERT DAWN
tracked along the rail then shifted to the two path around the clubhouse turn, tipped out and came three wide into the stretch and needed to find more in the
final furlong. FORTUNATA TENSIO was off a bit slow to begin, got shuffled between rivals on the first turn, chased three deep on the backstretch, lost
ground under urging on the far turn and weakened. MISS EVERYTHING sat off the pace in early going, raced outside a rival in the middle stages, driven
two wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CAIRO MEMORIES came away slow, moved to the two path, saved ground around the far turn and came up
empty. CLASSICAL ROMANCE went three wide around the first turn, trailed outside rivals into the second bend, went four wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LUCKY GIRL (IRE) broke slow from outside, reserved in the early going, advanced from outside up the backstretch, bid outside the leader at the
three-eighths pole, took over in upper stretch, cleared with a furlong remaining and held well to the line. AN AGENT MISTAKE chased three then two wide
on the first turn, steadied when bothered by rival at the nine-sixteenths pole, ranged up three wide leaving the backstretch, exchanged bumps with ISLAND
OF LOVE (IRE) entered the far turn, moved out in the stretch and finished well for the place. STERLING CREST (IRE) came away cleanly, tossed her head
around early, tracked off the inside, became rank again up the backstretch, went three wide into the second bend, two wide into the drive, moved out in the
lane and closed well in the final furlong. ISLAND OF LOVE (IRE) rated off the rail in the early going, exchanged bumps with AN AGENT MISTAKE entering
the far turn, sat behind the leaders exiting the bend, tipped out in upper stretch and finished willingly to the line. GOLD DRAGON QUEEN settled inside,
took closer order up in the middle stages, saved ground through the far turn, angled out in the lane and kept on while unable to threaten. PAMMY'S READY
took control early from inside, set the pace up the backstretch, challenged from outside entering the far turn, relinquished command in upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. VIRULENTE (FR) broke slow, steered to the inside, tipped out and came two wide into the lane, moved out in upper stretch
and failed to menace. URBAN was off slow at the start, got fanned four wide into the first turn then angled to the two path, dropped back to last on the far
turn and steered down to the rail and had little let for the drive.
