Footnotes
WALK THE BANK rated the pace from the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, drew clear at the five sixteenths, widened at
the rail on the far turn and extended his lead while kept alert through the lane. MOTIVATED SPEAKER settled off the rail on the opening turn, bid leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, drifted toward the head of the lane but dug in under steady encouragement to take second the
final strides. GATORATER rounded the first turn in the four and five paths, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of
the far turn and came along for third late. STALKING raced with the early pace inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back at the
five sixteenths, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened the final furlong. REGHITTO saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn just off the rail, was eased outward toward the head of the lane but steadied off the outside flank of Motivated Speaker at the eighth
pole and flattened stride from that point. PONY SOPRANO settled off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, flattened in the four path
of the far turn and left the turn outside. HIGH ROCK raced well back saving ground.

SNOW CANDY was shut off at the start and settled back in the three path the first turn, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
about the three path, dueled for the lead past the eighth pole and was steadily handled to hold on well. DONTFORGETTOBLINK settled off the pace leaving
the first turn, started a bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and finished well to take second nearing the sixteenth
pole. RED MESA exchanged contact with Dr. Grant at the break then stalked, moved to even terms at the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point,
cleared About To Rage approaching the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn but was caught weakening leaving the eighth pole. AGENT STONE
ducked out leaving the gate then saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. ABOUT TO RAGE rated the early
pace inside, was met at the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, but dropped back approaching the quarter pole and weakened at the rail
rounding the far turn. DR. GRANT exchanged contact with Red Mesa leaving the gate then stalked from the three path on the opening turn, started a bid
toward the three eighths pole but was fatally injured nearing the quarter pole and had to be euthanized on the track. The Stewards posted the inquiry before

gave chase, rounded the turn in the three and four paths, then dueled through the stretch to take the nod for third. MARIPOSA D'ORO broke outward to
make contact with My Best Friend then gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail then missed the nod in the stretch duel for third. COLLEGE KID gave
chase toward the outside, rounded the turn four wide and showed little in the lane. NICE N' BROAD gave chase, rounded the turn in the three path, raced

Footnotes
UNSPOKEN MEMORIES stalked two deep on the openig turn then took the nod into the backstretch, drew clear leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came
under pressure into the far turn, raced at the rail through the turn and was steadily handled down the lane. BREWING STORM rounded the first turn in the
five and six paths, raced outside into the backstretch and started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the five path and
dug in to take second late yards. HEROIC DEED settled off the pace about the three path on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened the final furlong. NEW SOUTH took the lead and angled to the inside to rate the pace, was met into the
backstretch, gave chase from that point but dropped back past the seven sixteenths pole and flattened in the three path of the far turn. MONOGRAM
rounded the first turn about the five path and showed little response through the backstretch. SWEET NATION saved ground. JUBA'S YANKEE ONE broke
in the air then settled back toward the inside and showed little response through the backstretch. TAKE A SWING raced off the pace in the two and three
paths the first turn, eased outward into the backstretch and showed little response.
