QUEENS GIFT was allowed to settle early on, moved up along the rail through the far turn into the stretch and finished well to be clear under strong
handling. HIGH COST OF LIVIN stalked the pace, moved up four wide around the far turn and finished second best. MITCH'S PINS was slow early, moved
up five to six wide through the upper stretch and made a good late bid. D'WILD MUFFIN dueled for the early lead from the inside and weakened late.
JACK'S PARTY GIRL settled off the early pace, raced along the inside and had no response. J'S TWOSTEP BEAUTY dueled for the early lead and gave
way. NEW YEARS LOVE failed to sustain a bid.

the inside and finished second best. BACK INTHAT ACTION stalked the pace, raced four wide through the upper stretch and had no final winning bid.

while racing two wide. AQUATICA was slow early and never threatened. CHIEFTESS settled off the early pace and failed to respond. PRUD AS PUNCH
