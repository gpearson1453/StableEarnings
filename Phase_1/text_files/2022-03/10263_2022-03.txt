Footnotes
SOOLEY stalked along the inside, shifted two, then three, wide entering the lane, grinded to bid at the furlong grounds, led leaving that marker, shifted down
and held from an outer bidding foe late. ALMANZO got caught in the four path while off of the pace around the turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane,
rallied while shifting inwardly in midstretch, bid at the sixteenth pole, but hung. OLD HICKORY settled far back in the two path, swung to the ten path leaving
the furlong grounds, and produced a good late kick to reach show late. AHIMAAZ prompted the pace two wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, led passing
that marker, cleared entering the lane, but met SOOLEY's challenge at the furlong grounds, and gave way. SERGEANT RECKLESS was briefly fractious in
the starting gate, saved ground off of the pace around the turn, improved inside of foes at the quarter pole before shifting two wide and between horses at
the three sixteenths pole, chased on his left lead to claim fourth in midstretch, but failed to threaten after changing leads entering the final sixteenth. MR. J.
MCKAY took the turn in the two to three path while well off of the pace, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, and failed to menace. BRIMESTONE KID
stalked in the three path, came under a drive into the turn, drifted to the five path entering the lane as the eventual runner up rallied alongside, got outkicked
by that foe at the three sixteenths pole, and tired. HERMS CROWN tracked two wide between horses, shifted three wide in upper stretch, was timid among
foes at the three sixteenths pole, and faded soon after. BOSS MOON BENNY hesitated at the start and broke multiple lengths slowly, lagged behind around
the turn, and never got involved. ALL OVER OLIVER set the pace along the inside, but was headed passing the five sixteenths pole, and weakened through
the lane.

Footnotes
HIGH LIMIT ROOM stalked two wide, led entering the lane, and drew off in midstretch. YES HE CAN staked three wide, took aim on a leading HIGH LIMIT
ROOM in upper stretch, but flopped back to his left lead at the furlong grounds, and failed to keep pace with that foe thereafter while proving second best.
BLACK SWORD tapped the inner part of the gate while breaking a step slowly, raced off of the pace in the three path around the turn, shifted to the six path
entering the lane, and stayed on. POPULIST tracked along the inside while a bit off of the rail, tipped to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a kick and
failed to menace. DENVER CITY set the pace along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner at the quarter pole, and weakened. VERB laid far
back in the four path, swung to the eight path entering the lane, but made little impact. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE broke slowly, shifted out to avoid a pulled up
rival approaching the turn, and showed little. GRINNING TIGER broke a step slowly, then sustained an injury leaving the half mile pole, was quickly pulled
approaching the turn, and was vanned off.

DEAL WITH HIM tracked three wide, ranged up five wide entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, led at the furlong grounds, and fended off an outer
challenger through the late stages. TOUCHUPONASTAR bumped the gate while breaking slowly, recovered a bit into the turn, swung four wide at the five
sixteenths pole, then six wide entering the lane, rallied to bid outside of the leader in the late stages, but was staved off. IRON IN THE FIRE chased the
leading pair form the two to three path, took a bump from an inner foe in upper stretch, bid between horses leaving the three sixteenths pole, but was

bumped an outer rival while shifting outside of the leading pair passing the quarter pole, bid at the three sixteenths marker along with outer rivals, but failed
to keep pace with a pair of them in the final furlong, gave way, and was nailed at the wire to dead heat for show. BIG ACE tracked in midpack two wide,
shifted three wide in midstretch, and moved up. CHECK ME OUT laid off of the main group four wide around the turn, and failed to menace. RELIC
HUNTER dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses passing the three sixteenths pole. AND FIFTY dueled for the lead along the inside,
but weakened leaving the three sixteenths grounds. JIMMIE'S HALO hopped slightly while breaking slowly, and made little impact. KILLINGSWORTH
stumbled at the start and never got involved. FIGHTING SOLDIER was outrun. RISKTAKER never got involved before being eased through the lane, then
was pulled up without reaching the wire, and walked off.

Footnotes
FORESTDUNGONE bumped an outer foe at the start, set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pressing UNRESTRICTED around the far turn,
shook clear of that foe entering the lane, then tired late, but lasted. UNRESTRICTED tracked in the three path, moved forward leaving the five furlong pole
to press the leader, but failed to keep pace with that rival passing the quarter pole while hanging on his left lead, kept on, rebid late as that rival tired, but
missed. PAYDAY TOO bumped with an inner foe at the start, saved ground far back early on, moved forward to track the pace at the half mile pole, chased
the leading trio around the far turn, then kept on to claim show approaching midstretch. IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT tracked in the four to three path around the
turns, but tired through the lane. CABO'S RUMOR laid off of the pace in the two to four paths, and failed to menace. VISION OF ANGELS failed to factor.
BAYOU JAM never got involved. POWER JET was outrun. WAITIN' ON A WOMAN stalked in the two path, but weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
DOUBLE BARREL MAN tracked along the inside, inched closer entering the lane, tipped outside of the clear leader at the three sixteenths pole, chased that
foe through midstretch, then reeled that tiring rival in approaching the wire. CREOLE CHARLIE set the pace inside of a pressing foe, shook clear entering
the lane while tipping a bit off of the inner railing, held sway through midstretch, but was worn down in the final sixteenth. FOOLISH DREAMS stalked the
leading pair from the three path, ranged up in the five path entering the lane, bid for place in upper stretch along with an inner DOUBLE BARREL MAN, but
was outkicked for that position while flattening out in midstretch. BINDING AGREEMENT took the turn in the two path while off of the pace, shifted to the six
path and outside of leading rivals at the three sixteenths pole, but lacked the needed rally. SCHNELL pressed two wide but faded between horses at the
quarter pole. MAGEEZ was outrun. MAY HOUR never got involved.

Footnotes
COCO TIGER set the pace in the two path while inside of a pressing rival, met HUG THE MUNNY's rail bid at the five sixteenths pole, clung to a narrow
margin while dueling with that foe through the lane, and held gamely. HUG THE MUNNY stalked two wide before clearing an inner foe approaching the turn,
tucked inside of the top pair entering the bend, slipped through along the rail to bid at the five sixteenths pole, dueled with the outer leader through the lane
while not quite able to reach his throatlatch, and was denied late. HONEY WON'T saved ground off of the pace, came into the lane in the four path, picked
up stride before tipping to the seven path at the furlong grounds, and rallied to reach show late. FREEDOM FACTOR trailed into the turn, came into the lane
in the six path, shifted out to the eight path while improving in midstretch, and rallied willingly for a minor share. COROT tracked along the inside, tipped
outside of the leading pair in upper stretch while claiming show, but was surpassed by a pair of outer rivals in the late stages. GET NONE tracked in the
three path, tipped to the five path in upper stretch, chased to bid for show at the sixteenth pole, but flattened out between horses late. DREWZANO tracked
in the two path while between horses around the turn, and failed to threaten. LOVETHATCAUSE settled far back in the two to three path, swung out to the
nine path entering the lane, and moved up. JUST BLAZE saved ground far back, but to no avail. BOURBON TAN took the turn in the four path while at the
rear, shied from an inner foe to the ten path entering the lane, and made little impact. MAKATI PHIL broke a step slowly, tracked from midpack along the
inside, shifted to the four path entering the lane, and tired. SPECTROLITE pressed two to three wide around the turn, and faded in the four path entering the
lane.

Footnotes
WINNING ROMANCE prompted the leader from the outside and in the four path around the first turn, then from the three path around the far turn, bid
entering the lane, led in upper stretch, and drew off entering the final furlong. SHE'S GONE D'WILD stalked two wide and between horses early on, then
only inside a foe while a bit off of the rail and behind the leaders around the far turn, tipped to the four path and outside of the leading pair at the three
sixteenths pole while failing to keep pace with the eventual winner, chased through the final furlong, and reeled in a tiring SPIRITED BEAUTY for place at
the wire. SPIRITED BEAUTY set the pace inside of a pressing WINNING ROMANCE while in the three path around the first turn, then in the two path
around the far turn, but was headed by that foe leaving the quarter pole, yielded approaching the furlong grounds, and was nailed for place at the wire. NET
A BEAR tracked along the inside, backed off down the backstretch before chasing under urging from midpack around the far turn, came into the lane in the
three path, and lacked the needed kick. FORT POLK laid off of the pace in the four path, stalked the top pair from that path around the far turn, but came
into the lane in the five path, and drifted outwardly in upper stretch while tiring. TECATE TIME never got involved. STRUMMER tracked in the five path, but
faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
OVA CHARGED dueled for the lead inside of OFFSPRING, kicked clear of that foe passing the quarter pole, and drew off under driving pressure while
resenting the rider's intermediate use of the crop. OFFSPRING dueled for the lead two wide, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart leaving the
quarter pole, yielded in the four path, met SNOWBALL's inside place bid at the sixteenth pole, and just saved that position late. SNOWBALL settled far back
in the two path, grinded away along the inside to bid for place inside of OFFSPRING entering the final sixteenth, but just missed reaching that position.
FAME FEATHER trailed along the inside, then shifted to the five path, and moved up between horses. EILEEN ALEXANDRA raced at the rear in the three
path, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and never got involved. CONDESA'S HANDMAID stalked the dueling leaders from the two path, but faded
in the four path through the lane. GIGABLAST tracked in midpack in the two path while under steady urging, shifted to the six path in upepr stretch, then
tired through the lane.

Footnotes
BEHEMAH STAR stalked in the four to three paths, chased the clear leader from the four path through upper stretch drifted outwardly in midstretch, grinded
away through the final furlong to bid entering the final sixteenth, and drew clear. HIGHLAND CREEK got a bit antsy awaiting the start, prompted the pace
two wide, stalked down the backstretch, bid into the far turn, led entering the lane, drew clear in upper stretch, but was caught in the final sixteenth. WHO
TOOK THE MONEY got a bit antsy awaiting the start, the was squeezed between horses at the break, raced far back, swung to the seven path entering the
lane, and rallied for a minor share. MAGA MAN broke inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, set the pace inside of HIGHLAND CREEK, inched clear
down the backstretch, met that foe's re-bid into the far turn, but was headed at the quarter pole, and gave way. JAX MAN tracked in the three to two path
early on, then along the inside around the far turn, and kept on through the lane. BALLINONABUDJET laid off of the pace two wide early on, and failed to
menace. BUDRO TALKING bumped an outer foe at the start, saved ground off of the pace, and failed to threaten. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE got hung out in
the six path in midpack around the first turn, and failed to factor. TREYS MIDNITE MOON raced far back, saved ground around the far turn, and failed to
make an impact. SILVER GALAXY hopped slightly before taking mild bumps from rivals on either side at the start, then made little impact. JIMI'S A STAR
never got involved. FREEDOMFI broke slowly and got outrun. DREWHUSTLE raced in midpack in the four path, and steadily faded. IT'S A BIRD tracked in
midpack in the five path and between horses around the first turn, and weakend.
