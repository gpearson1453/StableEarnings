JUST FINE BY ME never far back, rallied three-four into the stretch, urged along and edged clear late. PURE FASHION (GB) chased three wide to far turn,
gained a short lead late stretch but run down in the late stages. MI ENLACE had a troubled first turn inside, raced between horses to the half and gamely
ran on for the third spot. AMAZING DANCER sped to the front, stayed game in the stretch run but faltered in the late going. MY DIOR bit slow from the gate,
raced along close up to the stretch while never a menace with no late kick. AKA LIONESS had an outside run throughout and, never menaced. CROWELLA
between horses close up to the half but gave way readily thereafter. MAGIC SOLUTION was antsy in the gate, broke sharp, close up to the half but gave
way and dropped far back.

JACK'S DREAM quick from gate, chased leader, coming on between horses while all out and lunged nose in front on wire late. PETTINARI rushed up to
gain the led, pressured throughout, stayed well in the stretch run but outgamed to the wire in a good effort. OXWOOD had no speed to the stretch, rallied
with a late rush for third in a three way photo at the wire. ME WE raced evenly throughout while mildly in the stretch run. AMES MISTER was bothered at
the start, raced back to stretch and finished up mildly in the stretch run. MOUNTAIN TIME chased top pair to the stretch with no late gain in the final furlong.
MY PAL JOHNNY was through early and dropped far back. LITTLE CAIRO had an awkward start, broke in while never a menace thereafter. LESTERS
DREAM always outrun.

close up, rallied from quarter pole on the wrong lead through the stretch to the wire and might have been best. CAPTAIN FANTASTIC sandwiched at start,
raced inside to the turn, shuffled back past quarter pole and rallied late while coming on. EXPENSIVE CUT came in at the start squeezed rival, never far
back to the stretch with a wide run. GUN LAP three wide speed, dueled to deep stretch but faltered in the late going. THIRSTY OWL dueled between horses
to the turn, stayed game stretch but faltered in the final furlong. ALTMEISTER pressured on the lead to the half, used up gave way.
