Footnotes
INDIAN BELLA settled on the outside, was urged three then four wide on the turn, gained five wide to make a bid at the three-sixteenths then took a short
lead from the runner-up, battled outside of that foe under the crop in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. FOXTAIL came away well
while asked, showed in front early then was taken under a tight hold and relinquished the advantage, stalked outside the leading duo under stout restraint,
engaged those leaders while still in hand in the four path around the turn, had the rider take a peek behind him at the five-sixteenths, took the advantage
while the rider took five more looks to his inside into upper stretch, was asked while surprised by the presence of the winner to her outside at the
three-sixteenths then lost the advantage, kept on under a drive while fighting inside that foe in the final furlong and just missed while well clear for the place.
THAT IS KEY broke a half-step slow, settled towards the rear, was roused in the two path on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed
response while able to get the show. MAGNETIQUE contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths
under a strong hand-ride, battled under a drive into upper stretch and weakened. PEACHES AND SPICE was slow into stride, dropped well behind the rest
of the field, rounded the turn in the two path and was no factor. MY GIRL LEXI was hustled from the start, moved up to contest the pace on the inside, was
urged along passing the half-mile pole, vied inside under urging on the turn and stopped.

SCOTT ALAIA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside patiently handled until roused spinning three wide into upper stretch, then

RED PEPPER GRILL broke out a step at the start trading a bump with APPRECIATE who broke in a step, came under coaxing and chased forwardly
placed three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to collar the leader near the eighth pole,
then edged away to the finish kept to task. SABREEN broke in at the start forcing PAZZION to steady very briefly in behind, knocked heads with MISSION
TRAIL to her outside five then four paths off the rail, got given some rein and cleared that and other rivals half a mile from home quickly to tuck to the two
path into the turn and enjoyed sole command briefly before coming under threat from flanking challenges, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in
and was caught a furlong from home, then fought on well clear of the rest to be along second best. APPRECIATE broke in a step at the start trading a bump
with RED PEPPER GRILL who broke outwards, chased four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top pair while keeping on to secure the show honors. MIDMON chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled
three to four wide into upper stretch and made no late headway. HALF DAY PAM five paths off the inside briefly, tucked three wide and gave chase under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and offered no response. MISSION TRAIL dueled from the two path with SABREEN to her
outside, got shaken off by that rival and tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing in pursuit now at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and tired. PAZZION steadied briefly at the start as SABREEN took over the lane in front, chased along the inside under a ride from
midway on the turn, tipped three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
BLEWITT showed speed on the inside of two foes, dropped back along the rail early on the first turn then moved to the two path, was forwardly placed on
the outside, engaged the leaders in the three path on the far turn, took the advantage at the five-sixteenths, kicked clear into the stretch, extended the
advantage under a drive into the final furlong, swapped leads back and forth while shortening stride into the final sixteenth and held sway under strong
urging. REGAL QUALITY went four wide around the opening bend, settled on the outside, chased three then four wide on the turn, pursued the winner
under a drive in the stretch, gained on that foe into the final sixteenth and kept on well for the place. STRIKING SPEED showed speed on the outside of two
opponents, moved clear while dropping from the three path to the rail early on the initial turn, set the pace while in hand, was challenged near the
three-quarter pole, came under urging along the rail while inside of two foes on the far turn, lost the advantage to the winner passing the five-sixteenths and
weakened but was clear for the show. AMERICAN RULE moved out into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled off the pace, chased two then
three wide on the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and came up empty. MO GOTCHA was hustled from the gate, showed speed between
horses, dropped off the pace while two to three wide on the first turn, moved up to contest the lead with six furlongs to run, was asked between horses
leaving the backstretch, vied in the two path on the far turn and capitulated. MICROSCOPE veered out at the start and was last to commence, went three
wide on the first turn, was unhurried towards the rear, passed the five-eighths under coaxing, was ridden along while three then four wide on the far turn,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. PRIORITIZE angled in at the rear of the field, saved ground through the opening bend, was urged
along at the rear, went two to three wide on the far turn and was no factor. LOST IN ROME dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, settled off
the pace, dropped back under urging leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and failed to respond.

turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole then was asked for her best, responded well under threat in the final furlong, drifted out late and held gamely under
strong urging. BATTLE BLING broke a half-step slow, settled under some urging, went three wide while under stronger encouragement on the turn, moved
out under a drive inside the three-sixteenths, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed well to just miss while clear for the place. MAIDEN BEAUTY was
hustled to the front, drifted out leaving the chute, set the pace inside of a foe while well out in the track, moved in leaving the backstretch, was urged along
while two to three wide on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner at the quarter-pole, fought on with that foe into the final furlong and weakened but was
well clear for the show. SHARP STARR broke a half-step slow, was taken in hand early then settled off the pace, moved closer passing the three-quarter
pole, was urged along in the two path early on the turn, angled five wide inside the five-eighths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and came up empty.

Footnotes
EASY PLAY five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing inside the five-sixteenths, swung
five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just outside the eighth pole, dug in under challenge from flanking rivals and inched away in the late
stages to prevail. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under
coaxing from the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch, dug in running on to just get up for the place honors in the final jump. DOC DOC
ROCK broke out at the start and was corrected coming under hustling to chase two to three wide, got put to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on inside but was just nailed for the place honors on the wire. LOLLYGAG vied from the four path
loosely between foes, tucked to the two path half a mile from home and took over command at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under threat and was headed a furlong out, weakened in the late stages. QUIET TYPE broke out at the
start bumping COLBY GIRL, chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch and offered up late foot. U
SHOULD B DANCING chased four to five wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went eight wide into upper stretch and weakened. COLBY GIRL
bumped at the start by QUIET TYPE, who broke outwards, vied from the five path down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. KNOT JOKING hustled from the gate, chased three then two wide
under coaxing from midway on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. ARDUOUSLY hustled from the start, vied inside a pair from the two
path before tucking to the inside at the half mile pole, got displaced from the front with seven-sixteenths to and came under coaxing at that station, retreated
and went two to three wide at the head of the lane, then faltered in the stretch.
