Footnotes
STROLL SMOKIN rushed up outside horses down the backstretch, set the pace well off the inner rail and dug in late under urging. JOHN'S PROMISE ,
bumped and caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and rallied. SPITBALL
bumped with JOHN'S PROMISE leaving the starting gate, swung to the four path leaving the turn and rallied. SEANOW showed speed along the inner rail,
was taken to the two path entering the turn, returned to the inner rail turning for home and passed a tired rival. ROBEY'S BOY , wide leaving the turn, was
not a factor. BIG CITY BOB , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way in mid stretch.

Footnotes
MILITARY HOP , off towards the back when in close at the break, regrouped and angled in and pulled his way forward past the five eighths, continued
progress mid turn advancing to the inside of a rival, shifted out three to four wide, surged away under a drive in mid stretch then steadily widened from there.
TOP BOSS stalked the pace, moved up three to four wide approaching the stretch, wandered outward a bit pursuing near mid stretch, straightened and kept
on with effort to save the place. COOKE BROTHERS lagged off the pace, raced three wide in upper stretch, worked between rivals past mid stretch then
flattened out to the inside of TOP BOSS. MICE AND MEN leaned in at the break and bumped with a rival, raced off the pace, circled the turn four wide,
shifted wider and offered a mild kick. TOM TERRIFIC , bumped at the break, saved ground off the pace, eased out in upper stretch and had belated action.
BOURBON AND ICE saved ground, was hustled along mid turn and lacked a solid response. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) chased the pace, was ridden
along three wide mid turn and faded. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD sped clear early and set a sharp pace, drifted three wide in upper stretch, faltered and was
eased late.

Footnotes
FORTUNE'S FOOL , three wide to contention, rated kindly two wide while stalking, bid in hand outside the leader with a half mile to go, dueled under
confident handling mid way on the final turn, spurted clear approaching the lane, eagerly widened after being set down past the three sixteenths then held
firm while under steady hand encouragement through the final seventy yards. ROUGH SEA settled off the rail, edged up four wide outside foes nearing the
half mile marker, gave hard chase leaving the three eighths, circled a bit wider into the lane and finished up willingly to out kick CLUBMAN for the place.
CLUBMAN , taken to rate towards the inside, moved up between runners mid way on the final turn, continued progression between horses in mid stretch
kept on willingly but was out finished to the inside of ROUGH SEA. UNEQUIVOCAL , forwardly placed off the inside, took closer order three wide into the far
turn, gave four wide pursuit into the lane, stayed on willingly to mid stretch then failed to seriously kick on. MY GOOD MAN stumbled at the break,
regrouped and settled off the pace, advanced in the clear and got in range past the five sixteenths, swung out for a clear run leaving the three sixteenths but
lacked the needed punch. SHERIFF CHIP , keen early, opened up towards the rail, was reeled in nearing the far turn, sparred with the winner leaving the
three eighths, stayed on to about mid stretch then gave way. WHIRLIN CURLIN steadied off heels when advancing near the five eighths, recovered and
saved ground stalking past the three eighths, was ridden chasing into the lane and faded. LUDICROUS MODE broke outward then steadied, found himself
far back after a quarter mile, remained out of touch past the five sixteenths, raced wide through the drive and failed to threaten.

under steady hand encouragement and prevailed. COMBAT QUEEN rated forwardly, moved up to the inside of BEHIND THE COUCH nearing the quarter

gate, angled in and was taken to rate, saved some ground into the lane and rallied. TRITONE GAL was steadied off heels nearing the turn, swung out in
upper stretch but lacked a solid run. BEHIND THE COUCH prompted the pace outside the winner, was under asking chasing past the five sixteenths, drifted
a bit into the lane then faded. ARCHER'S HALL , four wide early, gave way. ELLIE BE DANCING , four wide early showing some speed, dropped back mid

late. LIGHTFOOT MISS lacked speed, raced near the inner rail the final furlong and passed tired horses. FORTES , well placed early, raced in the two path

Footnotes
PEYTON ELIZABETH was rated back off of the leading trio soon after the break, dropped in and was patiently handled stalking the pace, found room along
the rail to advance in upper stretch, closed in under left handed asking and challenged past mid stretch, forged clear with a sixteenth to go then held sway
under a drive. FINDING FAME drifted out at the break and bumped a rival, dropped back off the pace and settled while saving some ground, swung out five
wide for the drive and closed gamely to gain. JUROR NUMBER FOUR , bumped and pinched back at the break, regrouped and was taken to rate off the
rail, moved up swiftly after given her cue past the three eighths, bid four wide outside rivals to take command into the lane, kicked clear with a furlong
remaining, ceded the lead heading to the sixteenth pole then faded. PROPER ATTIRE stumbled at the break nearly unseating her rider, recovered and
rushed up inside rivals to take over, held a clear lead into the turn, drifted three wide soon into the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then gave way.
DECOUPAGE , three deep early forcing the pace, remained close past the five sixteenths, shifted in as the leader drifted out in upper stretch, pursued to
mid stretch then faded. PLATINUM FROLIC , bumped at the break, pressed between runners early, failed to keep pace past the five sixteenths and gave
way. Following a stewards' inquiry to the start and an objection by the rider of JUROR NUMBER FOUR, FINDING FAME was disqualified from second and
placed third

Footnotes
PRINCIPALITY stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, drifted in when challenging for the lead inside the eighth pole and drove clear. I'M NOT SLOW ,
two wide on the turn, remained off the rail in the stretch, steadied in tight quarters inside the eighth pole and finished gamely. HE ROLLS set the pace in the
two path around the turn, raced on his left lead in the stretch, drifted out in front of I'M NOT SURE inside the eighth pole, weakened and returned with a
bloody mouth. SHANGHAI CANDY lacked speed, worked between horses in the stretch and flattened out. HOLIDAY AVENUE , under urging three wide
midway on the turn, gave way. KAZU , under urging along the inner rail leaving the chute, was not a factor. PHRA PHROM hugged the inner rail chasing the
pace and weakened after six furlongs. An objection by the rider of I'M NOT SURE against the winner for alleged interference in deep stretch was not
allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch drive but no action was taken.
