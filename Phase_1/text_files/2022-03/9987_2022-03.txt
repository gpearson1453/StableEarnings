PERCHER was off a step slow, then was reserved and in between horses down the backstretch, made a four wide move on the turn to vie for command
leaving the turn, then dug in determinedly in the stretch to edge clear late under a drive. THUNDER GRUNDER was allowed to settle four wide early, made
a five wide sweep on the far turn to vie for command leaving the turn, then had a long drive with the winner but was outfinished late. THE BEST CANDY
was rated along the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and was along for the show award. AIN'T MISBEHAVIN chased the pace three to four wide
but lacked the needed rally. CANTSTOPRUNNING tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but was empty in the drive. ESPRESSO
CALIENTE broke in the air at the start, then raced on the inside and swung out three wide for the drive and had no rally. VOUCH set the pace on the inside
and gave way in the drive.

BELLA PRIMA dueled for the early lead two wide, then made a bid to shake clear and drop down to the rail on the turn, then drew off after a few pops left
handed with the riding crop leaving the three sixteenths, then was ridden out late to prove much the best. NYX AND CHAOS dueled with the winner three
wide early, then chased that rival three wide on the turn, proved to be no match for that rival while staying on to be second best. FUELED UP was bumped
at the start, chased the early pace three wide, made a mild four wide bid on the turn and then was empty in the drive. V W TURBO chased the early pace
and was two wide on the turn, then shifted to the inside in the stretch and weakened. DENALI RAE pressed the early pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
BIRD TRAFFIC was rated along two wide early, then was shuffled back leaving the half mild marker, dropped down to the inside on the turn, advanced
leaving the five sixteenths, then shifted out four wide nearing the furlong marker, then drew clear in the furlong grounds to prove best under strong handling.
ALLISON K was settled back early, made a five wide move on the turn to move into contention leaving the turn, but flattened out while getting up for the
place award. RIDGELYSREDHOT was away alertly to set the pace while clear and racing off the inside, then faded in the final furlong losing the place
award late. PRIDE IN THE BIZ chased the early pace and moved up on the inside down the backstretch, then shifted off the inside leaving the turn and
came up empty in the drive. NEARLY MISSED was allowed to settle early and was three to four wide on the turn and weakened. BRYCE'S PHILLY tracked
the pace three wide and tired. GOTTAFLATHAVEHER chased the pace four wide and stopped.

Footnotes
BLUEGRASS POSSE was rated along three wide, then made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, was clear by the sixteenth pole then held off C C'S
WARRIOR to prove best under a drive. C C'S WARRIOR was reserved early towards the inside, angled out leaving the three sixteenths and closed well on
the outside. JOINT AND SEVERAL was sent to the lead to set the pace while racing in the two path, turned back bids leaving the quarter pole but faded in
the final furlong, held show award. FED FEVER was settled back early, advanced on the turn and was four wide by the quarter pole, angled in by the furlong
marker and had a belated rally on the inside to just miss the show award. GRANDFIRE stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter
pole and flattened out. MASS APPEAL was well placed early and made a bid on the inside by the quarter pole but weakened in the drive. FOR THE
MOMENT was off a step slow, made a mild five wide bid by the quarter pole and came up empty in the drive. PASSCODE lacked a rally.
