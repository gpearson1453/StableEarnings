Footnotes
HENRY'S WORLD sped to the lead soon after the start and showed the way by a slim margin through early stages, roused three wide at the head of the
lane, responded, widened advantage then held clear late under firm handling. RESERVENOTATTAINED applied pace pressure to HENRY'S WORLD
through early stages, could not remain in touch with rival into the lane but remained game in pursuit and finished clearly second best. BAM BAM BLU
tracked the top pair into the turn, was ridden along four wide into the lane and churned on for a share. BIG CITY RED raced in the back, saved ground
around the turn and failed to rally.

Footnotes
FRAN'S STRIKE set the pace along the rail, took some pressure around the far turn, responded when KING OF TRUTH reached near even terms turning
for home, kicked clear nearing the eighth pole and widened under a drive. KING OF TRUTH stalked the winner two wide early, pressed the pace around the
far turn, reached near even terms entering the lane but was no match for the winner in the stretch. WICKED FAST hit the rail and bumped GHOSTINYOU
entering the first turn, saved ground off the pace, swung four wide in upper stretch, rallied outside and just missed second. PANORAMA TRUCK was in
range inside, tipped three wide nearing the quarter pole and was one-paced through the lane. GOD IS LOVE came in and bumped GHOSTINYOU entering
the first turn, raced off the pace two wide and never threatened. K. C. CHIEF tracked the pace three wide and tired in the drive. GHOSTINYOU was bumped
on both sides and pinched back entering the first turn and was never again in contention while racing two and three wide. FAST N STEADY played no factor
while racing three and four wide. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

FIRENSPICE settled early, advanced rapidly four wide on the turn, wrested command outside VELOCE BELLA into the stretch and pulled clear, shied out
from a left-hand crop entering the final furlong and continued to widen while shifting back in. BUNNYNOTBEAST raced three to four wide, stayed on task
through the lane and was up late for second. ARROW SHAPE raced evenly inside. DAVID'S ROSE chased the pace for three furlongs, and tired. VELOCE
BELLA received a bump on the hind end from AMAZING TRIP at the start, set the pace inside for three furlongs, and yielded readily to the winner turning for
home. AMAZING TRIP broke out into VELOCE BELLA and steadied back at a cost of several lengths, and raced far back inside.

I'LL FIGURE IT OUT was forwardly placed sitting just off the leader into the turn, hustled along three wide into the upper stretch, dug in gamely under
left-handed pressure, drove by UNSOCIABLE in late stages and edged away. UNSOCIABLE vied in opening strides then cleared and angled inside, held
firm still unleashed around the turn then roused for more at the head of the lane, held onto a diminishing lead mid-way through the stretch run then got
collared by the winner and stayed on for place. OLD TOWN ROAD raced in contention three wide around the turn, given cue entering the upper stretch, dug
in between foes late and captured show. FAITHFUL RULER vied in opening strides then edged back to race in range along the rail, launched a bid leaving
the turn, ran on in contention then finished evenly and got edged for show. LUCAGO switched out to race four paths wide in early stages, was ridden along
the outside into the lane, continued in range three deep in late stages and lacked the needed kick for impact. ALWAYS GAMBLING lacked speed and
angled inside, saved ground into the lane and never threatened. FROLIC MAN raced four wide off the early pace, tucked inside around the turn and steadily
faded.

Footnotes
R GIRL'S WERTH IT sped to the front, set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging late, straightened out
under hand urging in the final yards and just lasted. MUSICAL DESIGN was off slow, advanced inside around the turn, closed along the rail, briefly tipped
out near the sixteenth pole, angled back in when the winner drifted out late, surged inside and lost the bob. DEVILLY was bumped at the start, saved ground
in midpack, angled three wide leaving the quarter pole and ran on for the show. PERFECT PROVISION stalked the winner two wide in the clear and
weakened in the lane. RADIANT GEM raced off the pace two wide and never threatened. HARD TO CAPTURE chased the pace inside and faded through
the lane. ANNA AND MIA bumped with I SAID HEY at the start, saved ground and failed to menace. PRINCESS OF SWORDS played no factor while racing
three wide. BULLET ON TAP was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. I SAID HEY bumped with ANNA AND
MIA at the start, was in range two and three wide and faltered in the lane. DOVE IN CHARGE was outrun while racing four wide. VALIANT MISS was
bumped at the start, raced two wide and retreated nearing the lane. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

GITANA bumped with BE NAUGHTY WITH ME at the start, hustled to the lead inside, fended off repeated challenges from SHES ALL WOMAN and would
not be denied late. SHES ALL WOMAN pressed GITANA from outside throughout, and could not get by while clearly best of the others. FOXY LADY was
outrun early, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and was along to be a non-threatening third. BE NAUGHTY WITH ME bumped with GITANA at
the start, saved ground in range to the stretch, and faded. SMOOTH PEBBLE pursued the leaders three wide for three furlongs, and tired. PINO IN A

Footnotes
BEECHNUT TROPHY bumped and bobbled strides out of the gate and remained unhurried near the inside up the backstretch, angled out and edged a bit
closer late on the far turn, swung six wide into the upper stretch, quickly gathered up ground then shifted to the inside and surged clear. LOVE HER LOTS
steadied slightly approaching the first turn then settled midpack, was patiently handled inside around the far turn then shifted out at the head of the lane,
roused forward into close contention and outdueled rival for place. AMERICAN HEROINE stalked along the inside up the backstretch, launched a two wide
bid near the quarter pole, raced in striking distance a furlong out and got edged late for place. JUMEIRAH set the pace up the backstretch and held firm
around the far turn, continued to hold onto a diminishing lead with a furlong left to run then got swallowed up in deep stretch. RUNNING LEGACY steadied
approaching the first turn, was reserved racing in the back, swung to the outside entering the lane and passed tiring foes. THATAINT TOOSHABBY got
bumped between foes at the start then steadied approaching the first turn, settled three wide through early stages, showed interest when called upon late on
the far turn but failed to sustain bid in the lane. DEMOGORGON stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, continued in contention three wide around the far
turn then gave way. PHILLY EAGLES (IRE) raced near midpack, was ridden along three then two wide around the final turn and faded in the lane. RUN UP

Footnotes
DREAMING OF AUDREY lacked early speed, advanced three wide around the turn, seized command in upper stretch and drew off under a drive.
FEARLESS GIRL was bumped at the start, raced well back outside, advanced four wide around the turn and finished willingly to be clearly second best.
LEMONADE LADY chased the pace two wide, lacked the needed rally but stayed on to gain the show. MATCHA raced off the pace two wide between foes,
angled four wide in upper stretch and improved position. I LOVE MAGEL bumped with FEARLESS GIRL at the start, raced two wide and never threatened.
BLACK SWAN set the pace along the rail and tired in the drive. SOUPSTER prompted the pace two wide and retreated through the lane. PINCH MINE
played no factor while racing three wide. SUNDAY SUZANNE was outrun inside. GILDED ASSET trailed inside.
