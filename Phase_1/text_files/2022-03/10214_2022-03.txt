DOUBLE DARE YOU set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane and held GUARDING ELK CAMP off to gamely prevail.
GUARDING ELK CAMP was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and rallied late. MCGOLDIE pressed the pace while
racing four-wide, angled in with a furlong to run and finished willingly. SHESAHEATWAVE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn
and failed to gain in the drive. SWEET HONOR was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TRANS MISSISSIPPI settled
off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive.

into the stretch and rallied late. CAUCUS RULES broke sharply to dispute the early fractions with the winner from the inside and gave way after going a half.

with that rival and drew clear in the closing yards. RESULTANT showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished full of run.
MINNESOTA RED pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with that foe and gave way late.

and finished evenly. KEENEYE GEORGE was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the second turn and gave way. CREATIVE ONE settled off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, checked in mid-stretch and failed to rally. THIRSTY KISS chased the leaders while racing four-wide
and weakened after going a half. TRAPALIS showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. THE RACE WAS HAND

Footnotes
SHOOTING was away alertly to duel for the lead with PLAYFORTATERS, disposed of that rival after going three furlongs, opened a clear margin and was
ridden out to the wire. SON OF SMALLS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and was up for the place. SHACKEY'S
LOVE showed no early speed, raced seven-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. MIZZEN POWER chased the leaders while racing
four-wide, angled in with a furlong to run and failed to gain late. SUPER INTENSE was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a
factor. EZ RULER settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch and weakened. PRAYFORTATERS was away in good order to
duel for the lad with the winner while racing three-wide, weakened after going three furlongs and was eased.

Footnotes
NORTH FORK lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, reached BLAME THE DEVIL nearing the three-sixteenths pole, vied with that
rival and was fully extended to prevail through a hard drive. BLAME THE DEVIL stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing
the five-sixteenths pole, was challenged by the winner into the lane, vied with that foe but could not hold on. BY MOONLIGHT settled off the leaders early,
checked nearing the quarter, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly late. GIVE A LITTLE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace
and gave way after going three-quarters. SHAKELAS DESTINY lugged out through the first turn, showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the second
turn and did not offer a bid. AUTISM SAVANT showed brief speed and weakened. BIG LARRY chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened
after going a half.

Footnotes
QUINTO SOL stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths marker and drew off through the lane with
complete authority. HOLY CROSS was reserved just off the leaders early, angled out into the stretch and failed to gain on the winner late. ME B BUBBA T
was bumped soon after the start, lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn, drifted inward nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly.
GIVE EM HECK BECK settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. ABRAAJ MIRAGE showed no early
speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, steadied nearing the sixteenth pole and did not threaten thereafter. ZERO DOWN was off slow then
bumped nearing the seven-eighths marker, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. THE THIRD RING sprinted clear soon after the
start, saved ground while setting the pace and weakened after going a half. BREXTON showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and
weakened. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AND INQUIRY CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF ABRAAJ MIRAGE AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE AND
AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
