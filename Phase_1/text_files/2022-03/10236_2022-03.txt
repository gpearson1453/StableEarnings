Footnotes
MAMBA COOL showed early speed then stalked on the inside, tugged closer up the backstretch inside a pair of rivals, tipped three wide and bid between
rivals entering the lane, took over in upper stretch and drove clear to prove best. TALKLESSWORKMORE stumbled leaving the gate, reserved in the early
going and moved inside then moved closer while between rivals, bid four deep exiting the far turn and got outkicked by the winner. JUST ABOUT ENOUGH
hustled early then chased off the rail, bid two wide around the second bend and took over into the stretch, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and was no
match for the top pair late. BLUE STAR sat off the pace early on, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out in the lane and needed to find more. ITS BIG
forwardly placed early then got shuffled between rivals nearing the first turn, raced two then three wide around that bend, three deep in the middle stages,
lost ground on the far turn and could not rally. BEL RAGAZZO was off a bit slow to begin, saved ground trailing the field and was never a factor. SIPPIN N
KISSIN broke slow from outside then rushed up and cleared around the first turn and angled to the inside, showed the way to the far turn, held a short
leaving the second bend, lost the lead into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
MANITOWISH stalked the leading pair up the backstretch, took aim three wide into the stretch, rallied to the front at the sixteenth pole and prevailed over
the runner-up. BEAR CHUM (AUS) tracked the pace off the rail, angled in around the bend, rallied between foes with a sixteenth to go but lacked the
needed late punch to get by the winner. MCWHERTER dueled for the lead on the inside, put away ALLEVA nearing the eight pole, lost command with a
sixteenth remaining and held the show. VERY IRISH unhurried in the beginning, trailed two wide into the turn, raced near the inside entering the stretch and
never threatened. BLACK STORM threw his head and broke a couple lengths slow, chased off the pace on the inside into the turn, moved out around the
bend and raced three to four wide into the stretch, altered out from behind rival at the sixteenth pole and never got invovled. ALLEVA dueled for command
outside MCWHERTER into and around the turn, fought two wide into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
OVER REGULATED angled in early, tracked along the inside, coaxed around the far turn while angling out, rallied widest in the lane and reached the front
approaching the sixteenth pole and edged away late. SQUARE CAT was hard to load prior to the start, showed speed four deep into the first turn then
ceded control and moved into the three path, bid three deep on the far turn, took over in upper stretch, was overtaken with a sixteenth to go and stayed on
well for second. FORE FLAG pulled early then steadied between foes early, remained close and vied between foes into the first turn, prompted the pace
from outside in the middle stages, challenged around the far turn and vied between foes into the lane, fought to midstretch and flattened in the final
sixteenth. EREBUS vied along the rail into the first turn then took a short lead, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, vied inside with a pair of
rivals into the lane, lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened past the eighth pole. STRAUS'S PLACE vied three deep into the first turn then chased in the
two path leaving the bend, traveled between runners to the far turn, lost ground around that bend and was no match in the drive. ATTENZIONE hesitated
and broke slow, saved ground into the lane and failed to menace. CENTRE CIRCLE broke slow, got impeded by the winner and checked early, went two
wide around the first turn then moved inside, tipped three wide leaving the far turn and made no impact. HOTROD RIDE was fractious in the gate, came
away slowly, went three then two wide around the first turn, three to four wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH got bumped leaving the gate, sped to the front and crossed over, set a pressured pace into and around the turn, shook free at the
top of the lane and drew away. BIG SPORT broke well then steadied off the heels of the winner early, switch to the outside and prompted the pace two
wide, lost contact at the top of the stretch and stayed on to prove second best. SMILEFORME broke out and bumped rival, got crowded between rivals
early, rounded the turn four wide and lacked a late bid. HALF RIGHT broke a step slow and got knocked into the winner at the start, raced up close three
deep into the turn, chased three wide into the stretch and weakened.

VANZZY was off a bit slow to begin, rated on the inside early, steered out and was closest in pursuit three wide into the lane, bid outside the runner-up at
the eight pole and drove past. MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS broke out and bumped rival, set the pace on the inside, remained unchallenged into the drive,
tested by VANZZY with a furlong left to run and yielded grudgingly. ECRIVAIN (FR) allowed to settle in the early going and tucked inside, chased two wide
into the lane, came out in upper stretch, lugged inward in midstretch and kept on willingly for third. DEAN MARTINI bumped with inner rival at the start, got
blocked behind LAMBEAU early on the far turn then angled to the inside moved out in the stretch and could not rally. LAMBEAU got bumped on both sides
at the start, stalked in the two path or off the rail, dropped back two wide then three wide around the bend and came up empty.

GOOD VIBES ONLY prompted the pace from outside early, dueled into the turn, took over with three-eighths remaining, shook free in upper stretch and
drew away. RANTANEN settled five then four rivals deep early on, traveled four wide into the turn, three wide into the lane, could not threaten the winner but
held the place. DIXIE'S TWO STENTS chased along the inside through the turn, tipped out in the lane, summoned a mild rally but could not gain the place.
PYEONG CHANG set the pace inside of GOOD VIBES ONLY up the backstretch, dueled with that rival around the turn, fought back to upper stretch and
weakened along the fence. SWISS SWOO (IRE) raced between rivals off the pace, got put in a bit tight at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into
the lane and could not rally. FLASH OF GENIUS traveled four then three deep up the backstretch, took the turn three wide and tired. HIDING THE BRICK
broke through the gate and had to be reloaded, chased three deep then crowded between rivals and dropped back to last, went five then four wide on the
turn and tired.

Footnotes
WHISTLER'S STYLE settled early in the two path near the back outside a rival, steed out on the far turn, rallied widest in the lane, reached the front with a
sixteenth left and drew clear. RENEGADE PRINCESS traveled in range outside a rival, angled out in upper stretch, rallied between foes in deep stretch but
got outclosed by the winner. NAUGHTY EVELYN set the pace under pressure from SONG OF FIRE, held a narrow advantage into the final furlong, was
overtaken in midstretch, was no match for the top pair in the final sixteenth but churned on edge SONG OF FIRE for the show honors. SONG OF FIRE
pressed the pace from outside, raced on even terms into the lane, led briefly in midstretch then relinquished command at the sixteenth pole and flattened to
fourth. CHEERFUL CHARM stumbled badly at the start, stalked the pace on the inside, lacked room behind the top pair nearing the quarter pole, angled out
in upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong, bled following the race and walked off. READY AT MIDNIGHT broke inward leaving the gate, tucked inside
on the first turn, saved ground into the lane and never responded to urging.
