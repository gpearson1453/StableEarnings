Footnotes
ANTIPOISON bumped with DEJOHN leaving the starting gate, chased the pace three wide around the turn, gained command in upper stretch, opened up in
mid stretch and held sway under steady handling. DEJOHN bumped with the winner when forced in by GLORIOUS WEEKEND soon after the break, circled
the turn four deep and gamely chased the winner through the stretch. NOT TELLING , along the inner rail entering the turn, moved over to the two path mid
way on the turn, angled out in mid stretch and finished willingly. MUSTY RED saved ground around the turn, raced along the inner rail in the stretch and
lacked a sufficient rally. TIZ GOLDEN , pinched back leaving the starting gate, swung four wide approaching the stretch and was not a factor. MANKLIN
CREEK , four wide leaving the turn, was outrun. GLORIOUS WEEKEND caused a jam up when bearing in leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on
the turn and was no factor. BALTIMORE BUD , quickly clear, set the pace along the rail to the stretch, faltered and was eased.

ONE TWO KID , brushed at the break, was nudged up three to four wide and poked a head in front past the seven eighths, cleared then set the pace off the
inside, handled an inside challenge past the five eighths, met and outside bid from ALBERTANO leaving the far turn, dueled three wide and to the inside of
that rival into the lane, lost the lead past the three sixteenths, battled back under strong encouragement to regain command leaving mid stretch, kicked clear
then held firm while under solid handling. ALBERTANO came out at the break and brushed with the winner, vied between runners into the first turn, shifted
out and stalked three to four wide, bid to engage ONE TWO KID exiting the far turn, sparred in the four path into the lane, moved to a short advantage soon
after, failed to match strides leaving the furlong grounds but kept on with good energy. DR. FERBER prompted the pace along the rail, bid inside the winner
leaving the five eighths and pressed, failed to keep pace leaving the far turn, stayed on to give hard chase into the lane but went evenly late. MAID THE
JOURNEY , five wide early, rated four wide past the three quarter pole, edged up approaching the three eighths, chased outside a rival leaving the five
sixteenths but needed more late. LET US MAKE GOLD broke a step slow, moved up and was in range while saving some ground past the five eighths, was
under pressure around the final turn but failed to generate a rally.

Footnotes
LITTLE MS SCARLET rated behind rivals heading to the half mile marker, angled out and picked up steam four wide, made a strong under left handed
asking to take over nearing mid stretch then pulled away with vigor while kept to task. UNREQUITED LOVE cleared early, set the pace towards the inside,
was collared in upper stretch, failed to deny the winner but kept on with effort to be clear for the place. MAUREENLOVESFRANK broke outward into
GRACE ISABELLA, corrected and stalked three wide between runners, edged up to be the closest pursuer leaving the far turn, gave hard chase into the
lane but came up empty in the final furlong. MOVIE SCORE , two wide between runners, stayed in touch to mid turn then gave way. GRACE ISABELLA ,
brushed at the break, rated four wide outside rivals leaving the five eighths, chased three wide mid turn and weakened. DEVILISH AFFAIR edged up inside
rivals nearing the five eighths then was taken to rate, chased while still inside leaving the three eighths, checked out of tight quarters approaching the
quarter pole, shifted out and was eased through the drive.

SHE'S A BIG DEAL saved ground around the turn prompting the pace, battled inside MY BOSS through the stretch, drifted out approaching the wire and
narrowly prevailed. MY BOSS set the pace outside the winner, dug in during the drive, drifted out near the finish and just missed in a game effort. MO FIRE ,
three wide around the turn, was well positioned entering the stretch and flattened out. JOE MIKE JIM , four deep on the turn, lacked a rally. SWEET TALIA ,
three deep around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole and was not a factor. MONARCH BEACH hugged the
inner rail around the turn and failed to rally. BISTRITA lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn and gave way.

ROYAL THUNDER vied outside RAD PAISLEY while under nice handling, asserted himself and was roused clear soon into the lane, opened up under left
handed asking past mid stretch and was under solid hand encouragement through the final sixteenth. MONSTER MASON broke a step slow, lagged off the
early pace, saved ground into the lane, eased out, split rivals with a strong run past mid stretch and continued on well to be second best. THE REVENGER ,
four wide early, stalked the dueling leaders three wide past the five sixteenths, was under pressure pursuing to mid stretch, came up empty but managed to
save the show. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO saved ground while in range early, dropped back some around the turn, eased out in upper stretch, worked
between runners but needed more. HE'S ORIENTATE , off the early pace while saving ground, angled four wide and lacked a bid. RAD PAISLEY took a
short lead between runners leaving the five eighths, secured the inside and was hounded by the winner, ceded command soon into the lane, failed to go on
past the furlong grounds and faltered.

Footnotes
UNCLE BUDDY took over early and set a rated pace off the inside, dug in when confronted from his outside near the five sixteenths, sparred with
GOLDENIZE from there, was headed leaving the three sixteenths, fought back under left handed urging to reclaim the lead inside the furlong grounds,
spurted away a bit inside the sixteenth pole then held firm. GOLDENIZE rated four wide in range and outside rivals past the five eighths, crept closer in hand
leaving the far turn, bid to engage mid turn, dueled and gained a slim lead past the three sixteenths, could not hold on leaving the eighth pole but kept on
with interest to the wire. CRABS N BEER , urged along chasing off the inside, circled four wide into the lane but failed to generated a solid finish.
STEINBECK edged up along the rail heading to the five eighths to attend the pace, saw the leader edge away a bit leaving the far turn, was under pressure
pursuing and saving ground mid turn, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and faded. ONE TEN , off the pace while saving ground, swung four wide
into the lane but failed to menace. LOW COUNTRY DUDE , between runners early, dropped in and saved ground around the turn, was under pressure into
the stretch but came up empty. MOCEPHUS bobbled at the break, stalked three wide early on, failed to go on leaving the far turn, faltered and was eased
late.

Footnotes
I'M NOT SLOW , three deep the first turn, raced in the two path on the far turn, closed steadily outside PHRA PHROM the final furlong and took the lead
late. PHRA PHROM bumped BISCOTTO D'ORO when bearing out leaving the starting gate, was hard sent to make the early lead, set the pace along the
inner rail and weakened late. KAZU chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and had a
slight rally. BISCOTTO D'ORO , soundly bumped leaving the starting gate, circled the far turn three deep to reach a striking position then gave way the final
furlong. WATERMELON CRUSH , a forward factor near the inner rail down the backstretch, faltered on the far turn.
