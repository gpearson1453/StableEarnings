Footnotes
LONDON GOLD came away in good order, stalked the pace on the outside while in hand, was let out late on the backstretch, chased in the three path
around the turn, gained coming to the quarter-pole, took the lead under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, disposed of the runner-up outside the furlong
marker and drew clear under strong urging. MY DELICIOUS bumped with a rival while breaking in front then was hustled before being taken in hand early,
showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was shaken-up outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner in
upper stretch, fought on with that foe into the final furlong then proved no match while far clear for the place. U CANT HANDLE THIS broke a step slow, was
rated off the pace early then leveled out before the nine-sixteenths, dropped back under urging while saving ground on the turn and came up empty while
just able to get the show. IN SANDALS brushed the inside of the gate and was off a step slow, chased the pace on the outside, dropped back four wide on
the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and capitulated. ROMA CARPE settled at the rear, was roused in the two path on the turn, came out three to
four wide into upper stretch and failed to respond. ANCHOR LADY bumped with an opponent at the start, was rated just off the early pace, dropped back
under urging with a half-mile to run, fell to the rear in the two then three path on the turn and faltered.

LOVE AND LOVE raced four then three wide in pursuit just off the top pair coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper
stretch and rallied to take command a furlong out, then edged clear to prevail. FROST ME attended the leader to the outside four then three wide getting
placed to coaxing three furlongs from home and advancing through the latter portion of the turn to take over the front spinning four wide into upper stretch,
dug in under threat to the outside and was collared a furlong from home, ran on to secure the place honors, clear of the rest. COURAGEOUS GIRL coaxed
from the gate, established the front shortly after and showed the way rated three then two wide under the close eye of FROST ME to the outside but facing
little pressure save her presence, came under coaxing at the three-eighths as that rival intensified the pressure, yielded command swinging three wide into
upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. TONED UP lightly coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from
home, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN three wide in pursuit, tipped out to the five or six
path with nine-sixteenths to go before tucking four wide through the turn advancing mildly under coaxing from the three-eighths, tipped six to seven wide at
the head of the lane and weakened in the stretch.

THRILL OF IT showed speed then pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the three path early on the turn, took the
advantage inside the three-eighths then was asked coming to the five-sixteenths, responded well under threat from the runner-up into upper stretch, came
under a right-handed crop outside the eighth-pole, fought gamely in the final furlong and determinedly prevailed under strong urging. COLLOQUY showed
early speed then tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the four path on the turn, gained to make a bid into upper stretch, had the crop
knocked from the left-hand of the rider outside the eighth-pole, fought with the winner in the final furlong and missed while far clear for the place. FRONT
PORCH dropped back under urging, went three wide while hard ridden around the turn, came four wide into upper stretch and failed to respond while best
of the rest. KAZ SUGAR BANK showed speed then set the pace under pressure to his outside, was asked in the two path early on the turn, lost the
advantage to the winner outside the five-sixteenths then dropped to the rail, fell back into upper stretch and tired. KONG LOVES A FIGHT was off slow and

crop in the stretch and held under strong urging. AMERICAN MONARCH bumped with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the
three path through the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished with good courage for the place. ARTHUR'S HOPE bumped with a
foe at the start, was in tight briefly near the eleven-sixteenths, went four then five wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and improved for
the show. COMPETITIVE SAINT bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, raced off the pace under urging, went three to four wide on the turn and
lacked the needed response. SAGAMORE MISCHIEF bumped with an opponent at the start, was rated just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was
roused late on that bend and came up empty. JEMOGRAPHY raced at the rear under some urging, traveled around the turn in the three path, swung six

Footnotes
YO CUZ established the front and showed the way in hand four then three wide down the backstretch briefly taking to the two path before tucking inside half
a mile from home, came under light coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, drew off under a drive kept to task. STONE
CREATOR five then four wide down the backstretch just off the pace early on, advanced and tucked three wide briefly before taking to the two path through
the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths in closest chase of the leader, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for that rival
while running on to secure the place honors on the wire. CAPTAINSDAUGHTER four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. SANDY'S GARDEN chased two to three wide in aim of the leader early on, came under
coaxing three furlongs from home in the midst of being shaken off by the top pair, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. SALSA A PARTE
six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway, continued four wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. SILVER FIST stumbled badly at the start nearly belly flopping before up-righting herself conceding three lengths to the front,
came under coaxing and rushed up from the two path, tucked inside five furlongs from home, came under urging near the three-eighths beginning to back
away, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
RED PEPPER GRILL went to the front, showed the way under some pressure to her outside, went around the turn in the two path, responded well when
asked for her best into upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. CARLY HUSTLE moved out then tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the
four path on the turn, dropped to the three path while in dead-aim into upper stretch then was roused for more, threw her ears forward and tried to pull
herself up outside the furlong marker, was asked to pick it back up by the rider, responded mildly to that request and held the place while continuing a bit
erratically to the wire. MEBS WEB was well placed down the backstretch, came under nearing the seven-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn and
weakened while clearly best of the rest. CALIBOGUE SOUND was urged early then settled well back in the field, saved ground on the turn and was no
factor. CALESCENT was hustled from the start, prompted the pace on the outside, was asked near the seven-sixteenths, vied in the three path on the turn,
spun four wide into the stretch and tired. SUPER TWENTY SEVEN was hustled from the start then urged along at the rear, went three wide on the turn and
trailed.
