Footnotes
BELLE REBELLE set the pace along the inside, showed the way with a clear advantage around the turn, inched further away at the quarter pole before
being set down leaving the three-sixteenths, then held safely from a pursuing MISREAD in the late stages while under light encouragement. MISREAD laid
off of the pace in the four path, rallied in upper stretch, shifted down while surpassing inner foes in the final furlong to take aim on the clear leader entering
the final sixteenth, but did not have enough to reel that foe in late, and was second best. PATNA raced forwardly placed early on two wide and between
horses, but was restrained back under a firm hold approaching the turn, retreated to midpack before getting outmoved by the eventual runner up
approaching the five sixteenths pole, shifted ground five wide and outside of leading rivals at the furlong grounds, and moved up in the late stages.
VIOLENT OUTBURST trailed around the turn, cut the gap on the rest of the group entering midstretch, swung to the six path approaching the final sixteenth,
and stayed on late. GEORGETOWN ROAD tracked three wide around the turn, chased from between horses through upper stretch while failing to keep
pace with the leader, got outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, yielded thereafter, and dead heated for fifth. SPEAKING OF CHANGE hopped a
bit at the start while breaking slowly, raced far back in the three path around the turn, swung out to the six path entering the lane, then stayed on mildly
before flattening late to dead heat for fifth. CATCH MAGIC broke a bit inwardly, tracked along the inside, but weakened through the final furlong.
EXACTITUDE stalked two wide, chased between horses through upper stretch after failing to keep pace with the leader entering the lane, then tired through
the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
MAZUMA stalked along the inside while a bit keen into the first turn, comfortably pursued the leaders down the backstretch, tipped two wide around the far
turn to surpass a tiring foe as TEPEU drew clear, took aim on that foe from the three path entering the lane, bid at the furlong grounds, assumed command
shortly after while flopping back to his left lead, and inched away through the late stages. MCGOLDEN laid among the forward group two wide and between
horses while a bit keen early on, settled a tracked from midpack around the first turn, moved closer three wide around the far turn while outside of MAZUMA,
but failed to match rallying strides with that foe while floated to the four path entering the lane, then stayed on in the final furlong, and reached place at the
wire. TEPEU prompted the leader from the outside while tugging stoutly in the bit in the four to three path around the first turn, led at three furlong pole when
let out a notch, cleared shortly after, showed the way through upper stretch as MAZUMA ranged up alongside, but offered little resistance to that one at the
furlong grounds, yielded, and was nailed at the wire for place. URBAN RECOVERY saved ground off of the pace, tracked in midpack around the far turn,
shifted off of the inside in upper stretch, then chased from between horses without menacing. MADISON LUVS DUKE laid off of the pace two wide, and
failed to factor. MIZZEN MAN set the pace in the three to two path around the first turn while feeling outer pressure from TEPEU approaching the
backstretch, then got headed by that foe into the far turn, failed to keep pace around that bend, and faded through the lane. KING DOODLE trailed along the
inside early on, and made little impact. BEYBLADER tracked three wide while in the five to four path around the first turn, then faded four wide around the
far turn. MY BROTHER PATRICK settled far back in the two path, but trailed leaving the half mile pole, and was outrun thereafter. NO HEAD-ON REPLAY

DREAMING OF NEANY tracked along the inside, comfortably stalked while just behind the leading trio around the far turn, shifted two wide turning for
home, split foes at the three sixteenths pole to bid inside of a leading COURTLY DOC a the furlong grounds, led shortly after, and held as that foe fought on.
COURTLY DOC leaned a bit inwardly at the start, pressed the pace two wide, vied between horses into the far turn as his outer stable-mate produced an
early bid, inched away from her counterparts passing the quarter pole, but was headed by an inner foe at the furlong grounds, and battled on through the
late stages. BODE'S CONNECTION settled far back along the inside, shifted to the four path entering the lane, searched for racing room behind the leaders
through upper stretch, shifted inwardly at the three sixteenths pole, split foes in the two path at the furlong grounds, claimed show from an outer rival a
sixteenth from home, and chased the top pair thereafter. MISHPACHAH laid off of the pace in the four to two path around the first turn, came under mild
urging around the far turn before swinging to the five path entering the lane, but only managed to chase, then lost show to an inner rival at the sixteenth
pole. WHOLELOTTAMO was fractious in the gate waiting for rivals to load, reared and popped open the gate with his front feet in the process, then tracked
from midpack in the five to four path around the first turn, was urged along in the four path around the far turn, got floated to the six path entering the lane
while inching closer to striking range, but lacked a kick while drifting out a bit in upper stretch, and tired. MISS JANA bobbled at the start, stalked three wide,
bid for the lead into the far turn, vied around that bend, but failed to keep pace in the four path passing the quarter pole, hung on her left lead until the three
sixteenths pole, then further weakened between horses. MY NANNY'S A HOOT raced far back in the six to three path around the first turn, and made little

Footnotes
FANCY MARTINI stalked two wide, pressed in the three path around the far turn, came into the lane in the four path, vied while shifting back down to the
three path in midstretch, sparked a duel with an inner rival at that marker, and edged an advantage in the final sixteenth. AMENSET set the pace, led from
an outer pressing rival while taking the far turn in the two path, clung to an advantage through upper stretch as that foe battled and an inner rival attempted
a bid, gradually shifted down approaching the furlong grounds and put her inner challenge to tight quarters, then dueled with her outer counterpart passing
that marker, but was bested in the final sixteenth. SPRING MAGIC stalked along the inside, attempted a bid for the lead inside of the leading pair in upper
stretch, but failed to secure that position before the leader put her to tight quarters approaching the furlong pole, took back at that junction, tipped outside of
the leading pair, and stayed on. LADY GOT MOVES tracked from midpack in the three path, inched closer in the three to four path turning for home before
being floated five wide by an inner MISSONI entering the lane, took a mild bump from that foe soon after, and kept on to secure a minor placing. MISSONI
laid off of the pace in the two path, moved forward between horses while tracking the leaders turning for home, tipped four wide entering the lane, bumped
an outer rival soon after, and flattened out. FORGOTTEN REALM trailed in the five to three path around the first turn, shifted to the six path in upper stretch
with plenty of work to do, then tipped to the eight path in the final furlong, and surpassed inner rivals late. TREASURE OF WAR broke a beat slowly before
shying mildly from an inner foe at eh start, settled far back in the three path, gained in the four to five path around the far turn before fanning to the seven
path entering the lane, but flattened out without contending. COCO PUFF bumped with an inner foe at the start, saved ground off of the pace, then failed to
factor. MARIA GONE WILD bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced forwardly placed three wide before shifting to the six path entering the backstretch,
then weakened into the far turn, and stopped. THE RIDER OF SPRING MAGIC CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF AMENSET FOR
INTERFERENCE AT THE FURLONG POLE, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISSALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS. THE THREE QUARTER FRACTION
WAS OMITTED AND IS PENDING REVIEW

Footnotes
COSMIC TRAIN trailed two wide, shifted to the three path entering the lane while much work to do, rallied while splitting rivals in upper stretch, bid inside of
MORE MEMORIES leaving the furlong grounds, sparred while hanging on his left lead, forged a narrow advantage at the sixteenth pole, and held. MORE
MEMORIES laid off of the pace in the two path, tracked from outside of the leading group in the four to five path around the far turn, rallied to bid
approaching the furlong grounds, led at that marker as an inner COSMIC TRAIN menaced, then dueled with that foe through the late stages, got headed at
the sixteenth pole, and was denied reclaiming even terms. JACK BOB AND LARRY vied in the three to two path around the first turn while inside of BLIND
FAITH, allowed that foe to clear entering the backstretch, set up shop outside of that foe soon after to stalk, inched closer down the backstretch and vied
outside of that foe while in the three path around the far turn, cleared turning for home, but weakened between bidding foes at the furlong grounds.
TAMBOURINE STAR laid forwardly placed in the two path early on, stalked three wide and in the four path around the far turn, took aim turning for home,
but weakened between horses in upper stretch. PLAY MO laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted form the three path to the five path in upper stretch,
and failed to menace. ITS WILD AGAIN hesitated at the start, raced far back along the inside, failed to gain in the five path around the far turn, and was no
factor. FIESTY FIST stalked along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, and faded. VODKA GIMLET broke a step slowly before being put to a bit of
tight quarters between horses at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, got hung out in the seven path around the far turn, and made little impact.
BIND FAITH vied outside of a rival while in the four to three path, cleared entering the backstretch, met that foe's outside rebid into the far turn, and
weakened turning for home. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS broke a bit inwardly, stalked in the five to four path around the first turn, but weakened at the half mile
pole, was done early, then eased through the stretch, and walked off.

Footnotes
YANKEE SEVEN prompted the pace two wide, bid in upper stretch, sparred as his inner counterpart fought on, drifted outwardly a bit under left handed
urging leaving the furlong grounds, flopped back to his left lead and straightened when the rider changed to right handed pressure, and edged away.
BERTIE'S GALAXY set the pace from a pressing YANKEE SEVEN, resisted that foe's bid in upper stretch, dueled while hanging on his left lead through the
lane, but was bested in the final sixteenth. ALTERANA tracked in midpack two wide and between horses while taking the turn in the three path, swung to the
six path entering the lane, and stayed on to claim show, and held that position from an outer rival late. HAIL STATE bumped an outer foe at the start,
tracked in midpack four wide, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, then stayed on to bid for show in the late stages, but was fended off by an inner
foe. X CLOWN saved ground in midpack, tipped two wide turning for home, chased between horses through upper stretch to vie for show at the furlong
grounds, but flattened out late. CUSTOM DEELITE stalked along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leading pair turning for home, chased through
upper stretch, then faded. SWOT ANALYSIS stalked three wide, but faded in the four path at the quarter pole, then further tired between horses in
midstretch. HALF AGAIN raced off of the pace along the inside, but faltered into the turn to be far back, and made little impact. A SONG FOR ARCH failed
to factor. CLASSY JOHN took mild bumps from rivals on either side at the start, raced at the rear in the two path, but was shuffled back behind HALF
AGAIN into the turn to trail the field, and failed to factor thereafter. SMOOTH COLLIERY never got involved. JAKE THE BAND MAN broke a step slowly
before being taken in hand and bumped by an inner rival at the start, took the turn far back in the four path, swung to the eight path in upper stretch, and
was outrun.

Footnotes
MARSALIS dueled for the lead inside of CLOUD WITHOUT REIN early on, then inside of a pair of foes as LAGOON loomed large entering the turn, got
headed by the latter turning for home, but confidently remained in hand entering the lane, disposed of that foe when let out a notch at the three sixteenths
pole, widened under the lightest of urging, and was geared down through the final sixteenth. VINCO tracked two wide and between horses early on,
remained a bit off of the rail around the turn after an inner foe weakened, improved inside of foes entering the lane, shifted outside of the top pair at the
three sixteenths pole with many lengths to find, stayed on well to claim place entering the final sixteenth, but failed to threaten the wrapped up leader late.
MALIBU S S bumped with an inner foe a few times in the opening furlong, raced far back, crept closer in the three path around the turn, swung to the six
path and outside of foes at the three sixteenths pole, and stayed on to claim show. LAGOON prompted the dueling pair from the outside, joined the fray
entering the turn, loomed large and produced a bold bid turning for home, dueled with a confident MARSALIS entering the lane, but proved no match for that
foe at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened through the final furlong. GREYS THE BOY broke outwardly, recovered to raced in midpack four wide
around the turn, got floated to the five path entering the lane, lacked a kick to produce a bid, then was outkicked by an outer rival for a minor share in the
final fulong. HYPERBOLIST bumped with an outer foe in the opening stages, laid far back in the two path, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and
passed tired rivals. ZARTOWNIS stalked early on, chased the dueling trio from the three path around the turn, came into the lane in the four path, and tired
between horses. CAN'T HUSH THIS broke slowly and shied from an inner foe at the start, then never got involved. CLOUD WITHOUT REIN dueled for the
lead outside of the eventual winner, then from between horses around the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. TAPIT TO THE LINE chased along
the inside, but weakened around the turn. RAMMER JAMMER laid off of the pace along the inside, but faded turning for home.

SHE CAN'T SING stalked three wide while in the four path around the first turn, bid outside of the leading pair from the three path at the five sixteenths pole,
led in the four path at the quarter pole, clung to a margin while hanging on her left lead to midstretch, but changed over at the furlong grounds, and inched
away. GAM'S MISSION laid off of the pace two wide, tipped outside of the leader to the five path at the three sixteenths, produced a grinding rally in pursuit
of that foe, bid for place at the furlong grounds, and secured that position while chasing. CLARA PEETERS (GB) stalked along the inside, but was outmoved
by the eventual winner into the far turn, stalked the leading trio around that bend, then tipped three wide in upper stretch as GAM'S MISSION ranged up
alongside, bid for place along with that foe at the furlong grounds, but was bested. LAKE LUCERNE broke a bit inwardly, saved ground in midpack, tipped
off of the rail entering the lane, then to the four path and between horses at the furlong grounds, and held fourth from an inner foe late. RUSSIAN MAFIA
settled reserved along the inside, saved ground around both turns, then shifted three wide at the furlong grounds, and improved between horses entering
the final sixteenth, but was denied reaching fourth. HENDY WOODS broke a bit outwardly, laid off of the pace three wide, then was floated to the five path in
midstretch, and made little impact. LOVELY RIDE pressed two wide, vied between horses turning for home, but was outkicked entering the lane, then
yielded between rivals at the furlong grounds. I HEAR YOU set the pace along the inside, met a pair of bids around the far turn, got headed entering the
lane, and weakened in midstretch. MISS TULSA was crowded between horses at the start, and got outrun.

Footnotes
OLYMPIAD stalked two wide, relaxed comfortably into stride in pursuit of the clear leader down the backstretch, ranged up turning for home to bid entering
the lane, led soon after, drove clear in upper stretch as PROXY gave chase, and held sway. PROXY tracked two wide while in the three path around the first
turn, rated back down the backstretch, picked up stride into the far turn, gained outside of the top pair while under urging in the four path around that bend,
took aim on a bidding OLYMPIAD passing the quarter pole, but only managed to chase that foe while claiming place at the furlong grounds, and proved
second best. PROMISE KEEPER was allowed to go forward inside of horses early on to set the pace, established a loose advantage entering the
backstretch, met OLYMPIAD's bid entering the lane, was headed at the quarter pole, then yielded in upper stretch, lost place at the furlong grounds, but
maintained show. SUPER STOCK tracked along the inside while a path off of the rail, chased the top pair around the far turn, got outmoved by an outer rival
entering the lane, and failed to threaten the top trio thereafter. HAPPY AMERICAN trailed early on, moved out of last into the far turn inched closer in the
three path while inside of PROXY around the far turn, but got outmoved by that foe turning for home while lacking room behind rivals, tipped to the five path
in upper stretch, but drifted a bit further out approaching the furlong grounds, and failed to rally. CHESS CHIEF broke well but failed to sustain forward early
positioning, laid off of the pace in the two path, trailed in the three path around the far turn, then shifted to the seven path in upper stretch, and never got
involved.

Footnotes
TWO EMMYS built a clear margin entering the first turn, showed the way via a loose and uncontested advantage, widened that margin in upper stretch, and
held stoutly thereafter. SANTIN stalked two wide as the leader's closest pursuer while not hassling him, then failed to keep pace with that foe in upper
stretch, dueled for place along with an inner CALVARY CHARGE through the lane, and edged that position in the final sixteenth. CAVALRY CHARGE was
timid to vie for the lead inside of TWO EMMYS early on, lost that option after a furlong when that foe shifted down, stalked comfortably enough from the
inside, but failed to keep pace with the loose leader in upper stretch, sparred inside of SANTIN for place through the lane, but was bested entering the final
sixteenth. SACRED LIFE (FR) trailed, took the far turn in the four path, swung to the eight path, and rallied to reach his stablemate for fourth on the wire.
DEVAMANI (FR) saved ground far back, rallied along the rail to claim fourth at the three sixteenths pole, but was nailed by an outer rival at the wire for that
position. FORTY UNDER tracked two to three wide, but drifted to the five path entering the lane, and faded. CAPTIVATING MOON laid off of the pace two
wide, shifted to the six to seven path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. ANOTHER MYSTERY settled far back two wide, took the far turn in the three
path, and made little impact. PEACOCK KITTEN saved ground in midpack, but came under a drive entering the far turn, and faded. THE QUARTER MILE
FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED

Footnotes
ECHO ZULU set the pace with her ears pricked while encountering mild pressure from an outer rival, felt sterner adversity as that foe and another outer rival
ranged up around the far turn, shook narrowly clear of those foes at the quarter pole, held a margin through upper stretch under light hand urging, came
under driving pressure entering the final furlong as HIDDEN CONNECTION again crept closer, dueled with that bidding foe through the late stages, and just
lasted via a tight photo. HIDDEN CONNECTION stalked outside of the leading pair while in the four path, took aim while inching closer at the five sixteenths
pole, briefly failed to keep pace with the leader entering the lane, kept on determinedly, grinded away through the final furlong to produce a late bid, but just
missed. FAVOR lunged outwardly and severely bothered BERNABREEZY at the start, tracked along the inside, got outmoved by an outer bidding HIDDEN
CONNECTION at the three furlong pole while awaiting racing room, slipped inside of a rival entering the lane to claim show at the quarter pole, then chased
the top pair home. TURNERLOOSE stalked outside of the leader from the three path while only applying light pressure, moved forward at the three furlong
pole to issue a challenge between horses turning for home, but yielded entering the lane. SEQUIST laid off of the pace along the inside, then in the two to
three path around the far turn, and failed to factor. BERNABREEZY was severely hampered and lost all chance after being squarely knocked off balance by
an inner foe at the start, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
EPICENTER failed to make the front early on, stalked along the inside while rating comfortably behind the top pair down the backstretch, tipped outside of
them at the five sixteenths pole, shifted to the six path while ranging up well in hand entering the lane, confidently forged an advantage at the three
sixteenths pole, then asserted his authority over his competition, kicked away while shifting inwardly, felt a left handed crop entering the final sixteenth, and
was wrapped up approaching the wire. ZOZOS set the pace while a bit off of the rail, encountered pressure from an outer PIONEER OF MEDINA down the
backstretch, disposed of that foe passing the quarter pole as EPICENTER loomed large, but proved no match for that foe approaching the final furlong, and
safely managed place. PIONEER OF MEDINA got loose pre-race, pressed outside of the leader from the three path down the backstretch, ratcheted up the
pressure around the far turn to bid at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace while getting outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, and was best
of the rest. RATTLE N ROLL laid off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the three path, came into the lane in the six path, chased from between horses
in midstretch, and moved up to reach a minor placing late. GALT tracked from midpack while shifting down from the four path to the three path around the
first turn, tucked to the rail into the far turn, claimed fourth entering the lane, then failed to threaten the top trio before losing fourth late. CALL ME MIDNIGHT
sat back when the gates opened and came out a step slowly, trailed the field around the first turn, moved out of last outside of SILENT POWER at the five
furlong pole while being forced outwardly by that foe, then crept a bit closer in the four path around the far turn, got floated to the nine path to remain outside
of a drifting KUPUNA entering the lane, then only produced a mild kick, attempted to vie for fourth in midstretch, but flattened out. KUPUNA tugged while
shifting out from the three to four path and outside of the leaders, tracked those foes down the backstretch and into the far turn, but drifted to the eight path
entering the lane before weakening. CURLY TAIL laid off of the pace along the inside, but was through after six furlongs. SILENT POWER was done early.
