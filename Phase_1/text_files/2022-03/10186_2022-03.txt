Footnotes
CANADIAN GINGER broke back, raced behind traffic into the turn, continued to save ground into the lane, closer upper stretch, shifted out past the furlong
marker, split foes, finished willingly to prove best. NORTHERN DIAMOND tracked the pace from along the inside, came in the two path for the drive,
displayed a modest amount of late interest to be up late for the show. DRINKATTHECREEK off a step slow,. raced back in the two path up the backstretch,
angled out and moved closer three wide turning for home, challenged on the outside of the first flight with less than a furlong remaining, could not match the
winner late, edged clear for the place. PARKIN IN THE REAR broke on top, got clear to set the pace inside, continued to hold a daylight advantage with a
furlong remaining, weakened, proved no match for the top two the final sixteenth, nipped late for the show. CATECHISM chased the leader for a half and
gave way.

Footnotes
DESCENTE with the pace while three wide, dueled through the second turn outside the runner up, extended duel to the wire with that one, fully extended to
prove best. ATHENAS SONG restless in the gate prior to the start, broke alertly, set or forced the pace along the inside, long drive while continuing along
the rail, proved stubborn to the end. HASHTAG WINNER in the second flight off the inside, raced four wide through most of the second turn when within
striking distance, mild rally well off the inside stretch to be slowly getting to the top two late. RIGHT TRAPPE dwelt at the start, closer after a half, dropped
inside final turn, also managed to close the gap on the lead pair while being outkicked for the show spot. BIG BASE in the second flight along the inside,
continued to save ground second turn, steadied behind a tiring rival with a quarter mile remaining, altered course off the inside, one paced stretch. LADY
GUSTO with the pace between the top two for six furlongs, gave way. TAKE CHARGE GAL finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
LOCH GARMAN pressed the pace from along the inside, dueled far turn, inherited a clear advantage when the other speed got out turning for home,
continued to hold a daylight advantage until late, just lasted. RIFT VALLEY settled in mid pack while saving ground, continued along the inside second turn,
encountered some traffic and waited briefly late in that ben, moved out slightly, split foes and was coming late when clear. MEGA MAX closest to the dueling
leaders toward the inside, saved ground second turn, roused upper stretch, slowly gaining while between the top two at the wire. GUARD behind the pace
just oft the inside, remained in the two path when one paced through the final turn, three wide into the lane, lacked closing punch. SO BRAVE lacked speed,
raced along the inside second turn, improved position through the stretch without posing a second. AXIS broke on top, set a contested pace in the two path
outside the winner, got out turning for home and began to falter. SEASIDE BOY off a step slow, four wide through the first turn, continued outside, four wide
again second bend, went evenly to the wire. STUD PUPPY settled early out in the strip to be four wide into the first turn, angled in a bit to race just off the
inside into the far turn, steered out four wide into the stretch, also came up empty for the stretch run. MOON IN THE SKY void of speed, never menaced.
WHATA SHOW OFF remained always back. SPORTY FLYER steadied at the start to break slowly, lacked speed, middle move three wide to briefly reach
contention in the second turn then stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
JOYFUL CADENCE pressed the issue early from along the inside, moved out, advanced and challenged between foes turn, put a head in front nearing the
furlong grounds, drifted out late when clear, was straightened and continued to expand his advantage under a right handed crop while drifting in during the
final strides. SOUTHERN GRAYCE forwardly placed outside, moved with the winner to challenge in the turn while outside that one, lost some ground into
the lane, could not get back to that one late while clear of the others. PERFECT HAPPINESS broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, weakened and
was unable to keep pace with the top two the final furlong, clear of the others. MELTING SNOW in the second flight, four wide into the lane, was never
dangerous. HEART FULL OF SOUL in the second flight through the turn, came up empty for the drive. BREAK CURFEW trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
MOLTO VIVACE confidently handled behind the leaders while just off the inside, tipped out into the three path when moving to challenge that pair late in the
turn, roused, kicked down the loose leader inside the furlong grounds to win going away. VULCAN broke on top, dueled up front closest to the inside,
disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, clear a furlong out, proved no match for the winner late, clearly second best. SAG HARBOR
tracked the pace while saving all the ground, proved no match for the top two late, determined for the show. MARVIN in mid pack while off the inside, three
wide late in the turn, had little for the drive to finish up evenly to miss the show. SITTIN ON GO off a step slow, raced back toward the inside, came three
wide into the lane, improved position with some belated interest. DEFLATER in the main body, was four wide midway on the turn, failed to muster a
response when called on for the drive. FIVE DREAMS alternated up front outside the runner up for a half, caved in entering the stretch. GREAT FACES
lacked speed, four to five wide when moving slightly closer in the turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
KERSHAW broke in and a step slow, raced back while settling well off the inside, advanced four to five wide late in the second turn, lost considerable
ground to the next two into the lane, challenged outside that par with a sixteenth remaining and proved best. SIGNOFTHECROSS stalked the pace inside,
moved up inside the leader to challenge late in the final turn, dueled past the furlong marker, proved game for the place while unable to contain the winner.
ROAMING UNION contested the issue closest to the inside into the first turn, showed the way onto the backstretch, garnered a larger advantage before a
half, two path far turn, allowed the runner up the rail soon after, dueled with that one through upper stretch, outkicked by the top two late while between
horses. LASTCHANCEATGLORY vied between in the early going while between horses, pressed the issue the middle half, fell back off the issue into the
lane to weaken slightly. HARDLY A SECRET in mid pack early while racing off the inside, dropped in late second turn, went evenly through the lane to lose
a position late. FIRST LINE bumped, off slowly, raced back, improved position through the stretch while not a serious threat. MOROCCO bumped, off
slowly, lacked speed, made little impact. BULL HOLLOW within striking distance early outside, four wide first turn, continued outside, four wide again
second bend, tired through the stretch. EGO off a step slow, four wide through both turns, remained always back. COLOSI prompted the early pace while
outside, steadily faded.

Footnotes
LAC VIEUX DESERT in the second flight while outside, four wide advance and challenge late in the turn, shook clear when straightened for home and
increased that advantage under steady handling. MARTIQUE MISS lacked early foot, raced off the inside into the turn, came three wide when being asked
for run into the lane, finished willingly to earn the place while not a threat to the winner. COMEDY ACT dueled off the inside, gained the advantage midway
on the turn, could not stay with the winner in the drive, weakened a bit late to be caught for the place. CANDYWRAPPER CRAZY lacked early speed, began
to advance midway on the turn, five wide into the lane, improved down the middle of the strip, too late for the show. CHURCH SERVICE in the second flight
while racing in the two path, asked along into the lane, finished up evenly. M M M MY SHAROANA void of early foot, remained back turn, improved position
through the stretch with some belated interest. JOG off a step slow, trailed for a half, passed tiring rivals while not a serious threat. DISTORTED SECRETS
forwardly placed early along the inside, began a steady fade before a half. DEVIOUS broke alertly, dueled up front while closest to the inside, first to blink
turning for home. MAGIC MAGS three out to four wide in the turn, faded. MCMANSION dwelt at the start, moved up to improve a bit early, gave way in the
drive.

Footnotes
ERNIE BANKER outrun early, steered out three wide late in the turn when beginning to advance, closed with good determination to prove best while
between horses at the wire. STRATOFORTRESS in the second flight outside, challenged turning for home, shook clear past the furlong marker, nipped in
the late going while closest to the inside of the first flight, gained the nod for the place. MESA MOON off the pace while well out in the strip, floated out five
wide by the winner turning into the stretch, rallied mid track, missed while widest at the wire. ROLLING FORK forwardly placed along the inside, in some
traffic into the lane, steered out, encountered additional traffic with a sixteenth to run while within striking distance, angled in, finished up evenly. LEAGUE
OF LEGENDS last to leave, trailed for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. DEVIL'S TOWER in mid pack off the inside, floated out
when directly outside the winner exiting the turn, weakened. LOCK UP sprinted well clear after the start, showed the way through the turn by daylight, gave
way when headed by the runner up entering the stretch. NAME REJECTED in the second flight for a half while between horses, backed up through the lane.

Footnotes
MORE THAN BLESSED four wide into the first turn, angled in a bit to save some ground under restraint, in the two path into the far bend, angled out four
wide turning for home, kept grinding on the outside to prove best. DINNER AT CRUMPIES broke on top, set or forced the pace in the two path, continued to
hold the advantage into the stretch, gave ground grudgingly to the winner while edging clear for the second spot. BIG SUCCESS in mid pack while racing
inside, moved closer in some traffic late in the final turn along the inside, in tight three sixteenths out, stayed on to earn the show. TWISTED DIXIE within
striking distance off the inside, steadied in traffic upper stretch, finished up with modest late interest to miss the nod for the show. BUDDY REAUX in mid
pack while racing just off the inside first turn, continued in the main body into the far turn, four wide into the lane, went one paced through the lane. DOC
IRWIN void of speed, three to four wide and in some traffic turning for home, lacked closing kick. SMOKIN BOOTS lacked speed when six wide into the first
turn, continued back, four wide second bend, improved a bit in the drive while not a threat. REEF'S DESTINY within striking distance while three wide,
faltered in the drive. YOU VEE CEE narrowly set the pace along the inside, was beginning to tire when in tight and steadied with a furlong remaining,
continued to give way. TOPF ROAD RULES broke back, trailed for a half well wide, five to six wide second turn when moving slightly closer, flattened out in
the drive. RUBIGINOUS mid pack while well wide, continued outside, four to five wide second turn, tired through the stretch. SUPER GEEK was never
involved in trailing home.
