Footnotes
UNION BLISS contested the early pace with BRANNIGAN, took the lead from that rival entering the backstretch run, opened the lead along the second turn,
was given a few reminders in upper stretch and was geared down in the end. FANTASTIC DREAM was allowed to settle in the early stages while outside of
rivals, maintained an outside path along the second turn, swung widest into the drive and was no match for the winner in the end but closed well late to
claim second. DADDYS SPECIALDARK saved ground while settling off of the early pace, gained ground two wide on the far turn, came over into the path of
BRANNIGAN in upper stretch, lacked a late response but kept on to secure the show. FAIT ACCOMPLI settled off of the pace, improved position four wide
on the second turn but did not go on with that bid and finished evenly in the final stages. MORE GUMPTION settled just off the early pace, steadily
advanced on UNION BLISS along the backstretch run and into the far turn, lost position into the stretch run and gave way in the final furlong. BRANNIGAN
was sent after breaking alertly and contested the early pace with UNION BLISS, ceded the lead to that foe entering the backstretch run, stalked the winner
into the second turn, lost ground into the drive, steadied at the furlong marker when passed by a rival and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
DUMB LUCK was hustled leaving the break and took a narrow advantage over OMMANEY BAY into the turn, carved fast fractions into the drive, shook free
from the runner-up in the final stages and edged clear in the end. OMMANEY BAY broke alertly, lost the early advantage to DUMB LUCK and pressed the
fast pace through the turn, could not match strides with the winner in the late going and was outfinished, but held safely for second. STING LIKE A BEE
stalked the quick pace from a three wide position, lost a bit of ground into the stretch run and was outkicked by the top pair, but was clear for the show.
SLIGHT APPROVAL was unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the turn, improved position into the stretch but lacked a final kick in the drive.
ON ICE lacked early speed, was steered four wide outside of rivals on the turn and was not a threat. DANNY'S IRISH BOY chased the pace from a three
wide path and gave way in the late stages.

LOTSABLING stalked the pace while saving ground through the first half-mile, was steered three wide nearing the quarter-marker, advanced in upper
stretch, took command inside of the furlong marker and kicked clear in the end. ACOUSTIC SHADOW stumbled at the start and spotted the field leaving the
break, was allowed to settle in the early stages, lost ground on the second turn four wide, swung widest into the drive and made a mild late gain to get the
nod for second. CITY GLITTER stalked the pace from a two wide path through the far turn, vied for the lead in upper stretch but was outfinished in the end
and just edged for the place. KOKO'S MOM broke alertly and took command of the early pace into the first turn, was prompted into the far turn by CITY
GLITTER while setting moderate fractions, came under pressure nearing the furlong grounds and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
FAR WEST tracked the moderate fractions from a two wide path through the second turn, closed on GOING AWAY PARTY in upper stretch, overtook that
foe inside of the furlong marker and edged clear in the end. FRIDAY'S AT SHADY settled just off of the early pace, gained ground three wide on the far turn,
closed in the final furlong and while unable to reel in the winner in the end was a clear second best. KNOWN was unhurried in the early going, advanced
along the backstretch, continued that run four wide on the second turn and into the drive but lacked a final bid in the stretch, while clear of the rest for third.
GOING AWAY PARTY broke alertly and was sent to set moderate fractions, was confronted by the winner in upper stretch, lost the lead inside of the furlong
grounds and weakened in the final stages. MAXINAMILLION stalked the early pace, was under a snug hold into the backstretch run, lost ground on the far
tun two wide and tired in the drive. MEGAMEISTER was allowed to settle in the early going while saving ground and was not a threat. BERNIE'S BIG BOY
settled just off of the early pace while outside of rivals, lost position along the second turn, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the lane and walked
off.

ROCKS AND SALT was allowed to settle off of the fast early pace, was roused four wide along the far turn while matching strides with GALLANT WARREN,
dueled with that foe to the final stages and dug in in the end to gamely prevail. GALLANT WARREN was unhurried in the early going while saving ground,
was steered three wide nearing the quarter-marker while matching strides with ROCKS AND SALT, dueled with that foe through the lane and was gamely
bested in the end, while well clear of the rest. MANILA MISCHIEF settled just off of the fast early pace while saving ground, maintained a rail trip into the far
turn, was outkicked in the stretch run but kept on to hold the show. ROCKTILLYOUDROP broke in the air and spotted the field at the break, lagged in the
early going, advanced along the second turn and into the stretch drive but was outfinished in the late stages. DESCARTES pressed the fast pace two wide
between foes through the first half-mile, kept pressure on ON RAGLAN ROAD nearing the quarter-marker, lost position into the drive and faded in the final
stages. TRASH TALKIN CAT disputed the fast early pace three wide through the backstretch run, lost ground on the far turn and tired in the stretch. ON
RAGLAN ROAD broke alertly and was hustled to the front, was pressed by two rivals through fast fractions into the second turn, was overtaken into the
stretch run and gave out in the late stages. BIG STORY settled off of the fast early pace, lost ground on the far turn three wide and stopped in upper stretch.

Footnotes
IN OUR A tracked the fast pace from a two wide path through the turn, confronted WAR GAMES nearing the furlong grounds, battled with that game foe
through the final sixteenth, made a late push under firm urging in the end and just held over the fast closing runner-up. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD was
forwardly placed while three wide in the early stages, gained ground in upper stretch, shifted out leaving the furlong marker, closed in the final sixteenth and
just missed for the win while getting up in time for second. WAR GAMES broke alertly and sped to the front in the early stages, carved out fast fractions
through the turn, was confronted by the winner nearing the furlong marker, battled back against that foe's bid but was outfinished in the end, while clear for
third. PERFECTIONISTIC chased the fast pace two wide through the turn, closed in the final furlong but could not reel in the top trio. LONG LANCE chased
the early pace, drifted in nearing the half-mile marker and bothered CLEM LABINE, saved ground through the turn and showed late interest in the stretch.
HEY MATE was fractious at the gate, chased the early pace from an inside path and was outkicked in the stretch run. CLEM LABINE was a step slow
leaving the break, took up sharply nearing the half-mile marker when LONG LANCE drifted in, continued on while trailing and was not a threat. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING CLEM LABINE AND LONG LANCE AND IN A MAJORITY DECISION RULED
THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER STEMMING FROM THE INCIDENT.

Footnotes
BENGAL TIGER had an alert beginning and sped to a clear lead into the turn, extended the lead nearing the quarter-marker, was given a few reminder taps
through the lane and was ridden out in the end in a good debut. ROSARITA CARMELITA stalked the fast pace from the inside, lost contact with the winner
in upper stretch but kept on to get the nod for second. LIVIN' AT THE BU chased from the midpack while four wide on the turn, was outkicked in the stretch
run and just missed for second while holding for third. KIND BUT SHE LIES stalked the fast pace three wide on the turn, lacked a final kick in the stretch run
and was just edged out for the place and show. LOCHMARA chased the pace from the second flight while five wide on the turn and gave way in the stretch
run. BROCARD chased the pace from toward the rear and tired in the drive. MISTICAL SURPRISE was fractious in the gate and broke in a tangle, lacked
early speed to the turn and was not a factor. BRITTANY BREEZE tracked the fast early pace from a two wide path, lost ground nearing the quarter-marker
and faded in the late stages.
