Footnotes
SOMEDAY IS TODAY took a quick lead and rated a clear pace inside, widened under hand urging off the rail on the far turn, was kept alert to mid-stretch,
then allowed to relax later yards. HERETODAYGONMANANA was blocked into the first turn and settled off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path and dueled through the stretch for second. FEEL THE LOVE saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase from
the three eighths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn and finished evenly while gaining on the runner-up. CEDARS BULLS EYE stalked in the two and
three paths, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. YOU'RE DOING
FINE saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then weakened. ARROWWOOD rounded the opening
turn in the four path, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, though weakened into the far turn.

JOSEF IS REAL rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, kept the advantage at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady
encouragement and just lasted. LOOKIN' SMART saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, dug in
through the final furlong, was closing fast and just missed by the nod of the head. CHARLIE POTATOES rounded the first turn in the four path, started a bid
leaving the three eighths pole, raced close two deep on the turn and finished well. BUZZHOUND stalked off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep, angled four wide into the stretch and finished evenly. HIGH PRINT raced off the pace two deep while
between horses, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and ran evenly to mid-stretch before flattening
stride. GHOST ON A MISSION saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane.
GOOFY BOY raced well back leaving the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and had little left. DAY OF
HONOR and DUNLUCE CAISSLE were not factors. KNOKKE BY THE SEA raced off the pace in the three path of the first turn then faded past the seven

Footnotes
FRANKEE MERCH rated a slim lead inside past the three quarter pole, came under pressure toward the three eighths, contested the edge nearest the rail
on the far turn, was bumped just inside the eighth pole but dug in determinedly to keep the edge. HE'S NOT CURLY settled off the rail the first turn, gave
chase into the backstretch and rounded the far turn two deep, dueled to a slim brief lead leaving the turn, came in to make contact with Frankee Merch past
the eighth pole and continued close while needing more. BROTHER SKYE saved ground well off the pace, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn off the rail, left the turn three wide and finished well. ENVISION SUCCESS raced well off the pace and off the rail the first turn, bid from the
seven sixteenths pole, ran two deep on the far turn and showed little in the lane. SKY GAZER R V F saved early ground racing well back, angled six wide
through the far turn and could only improve his position. WOODHAVEN KID settled in the three path the first turn and showed little response through the
backstretch. GRAN CITY raced outside into the backstretch and never factored. EPIC WEST raced four wide on the first turn then faded toward the three
eighths pole. LATE BREAKING NEWS stalked the earlier pace two deep, gave chase past the three eighths pole but faded leaving the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
JAYJAYDEE ran in the three path the first turn then stalked from the seven eighths pole, bid nearing the three eighths, took the lead two deep midway on
the far turn, drew clear into the lane, was steadily handled through the upper stretch but allowed to relax a bit later yards. SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR settled
off the rail early, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and dug in from the head of the lane to get second the final yards.
AUTS REVOLUTION took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail midway on the
far turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. FIND YOUR BOAZ raced well off the pace saving ground, bid approaching the three eighths pole, came
through the far turn in the five path and ran evenly in the lane. CATCH MY CABOOSE raced off the rail on the first turn and stalked from the seven eighths
pole, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths, then faded at the rail on the far turn. THE IRON BANK saved ground off the pace, gave chase toward the
three eighths pole, eased to the five path on the far turn and showed little in the stretch. SHAMCAT raced off the pace about the three path, picked up the
chase toward the three eighths pole then faded on the far turn. KATHERN'S JOY raced outside leaving the second turn and showed little response through
the backstretch. HARD BEING ME was never a factor. LOAN ME YOUR EAR raced well off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
SPANGLISH rounded the first turn in the five path and settled close into the backstretch, came from between horses with a bid and took the lead
approaching the five sixteenths pole, drew temporarily clear midway on the far turn then dug in to turn back the challenge of Tyry Tyrannosaurus and
cleared that one again later yards. JACKSON MAN settled off the pace inside on the first turn, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about
the three path and dug in from the head of the lane to take second under the wire. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS stalked from the two and three paths then
took the lead between horses approaching the three eighths pole, was caught toward the five sixteenths, raced close at the rail on the far turn then nipped
from second under the wire. MY BOY CLYDE raced off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the four
path of the far turn and passed rivals. C R'S MANDATE saved ground off the pace, bid toward the three eighths pole, ran two deep on the far turn and
showed little more. CATFISH rounded the first turn in the six path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn still about the six path and
showed little in the lane. ROLL DEM BONES took the lead at the rail into the first turn and rated the early pace, was met at the seven sixteenths pole and
gave chase through the backstretch then weakened nearing the far turn. ON A WHIM had a brief lead through the front stretch then stalked, recovered
another brief lead three wide at the seven sixteenths pole then faded from the five sixteenths. A FAREWELL YODEL rounded the first turn in the six path
and raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response.
