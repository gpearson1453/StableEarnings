FAMILY BIZ bumped at the start, was allowed to settle and raced in the back, advanced on the turn, bid five wide, assumed command between horses past
the eighth pole with a short lead, was under pressure and held on gamely. GAGE HAS A GRAY was checked at the start, was unhurried early, raced
outside, advanced to the turn, bid six wide, went willingly to the wire and couldn't get by the winner. CERNAN bumped at the start, pressed the pace, moved
up to challenge two across, drew off on the turn for a clear lead, faltered past the eighth pole and settled for show. IMPRESSION set a pressured pace, tired
on the turn and faded through the stretch. LOOKIN FOR GOLD was through early, steadily faded and was not urged late.

Footnotes
SHOE GAME was slow early, rallied around the turn, assumed command in the upper stretch and drew off under mild urging. MISS YOU MOM was void of
early speed, closed steadily mid track and earned place while no match for the winner. AROUSE N GO set the pace, drew off on the turn for a long lead,
tired and gave way. GOTTA BE LUCKY raced in hand early, stalked the pace while racing inside, bid and came up empty. MONGOLIAN WINDOW came in
at the start, went widest in the drive and lacked a response. MCGOLDIE bumped at the start, raced in the second flight between horses, tired into the turn
and gave way. PAIGE RUNNER bumped at the start, raced close to the pace outside, tired into the turn and stopped.

NEVADAN moved up outside to challenge three across, drew clear late and held off the late charge of COUNT ALEXEI under steady urging. COUNT
ALEXEI vied to the turn, was steadied between horses leaving the turn, fell back, angled out, came again and was gaining late. SUCCESS RATE saved
ground, angled out for the drive, bid eight wide and closed well to earn show. OVER EZ raced in the back, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and
offered a mild bid only. AWESOME HEIGHTS was hustled along to vie to deep stretch and faltered. FORGOTABOUTME had brief speed only. The
stewards' posted an inquiry concerning possible interference on the turn. No change was made.

Footnotes
CHEWY CHEWY GOOD pressed the pace, was carried out leaving the turn, dueled through the stretch and prevailed in a long drive. LADY LANA set the
pace, swung wide leaving the turn, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. SPUN LINE raced five wide along the backstretch, went
nine wide at the top of the stretch, closed steadily and gained late. LA CASTIGLIONE raced in hand early, raced in the back, bid to get within striking
distance and hung. MIDNIGHT GARDEN was not a factor. YES PLEASE broke awkwardly and was checked at the start, showed speed to the turn, tired
and was not urged late. MULLIGAN led early, pressed the pace along the inside, was through after a half, stopped and was not urged late. The stewards'
posted an inquiry concerning the start. No change was made.

Footnotes
HOLY CROSS stalked the pace while racing inside, assumed command along the rail on the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely under mild
urging. LUGIA was never far back, bid inside to get within range, hung late and held for place. LIGHTNING STAR pressed the pace, lacked the needed late
response and settled for show. E. Z. PAPA set the pace to the second turn, swung wide, fell back and weakened. FLYING CHARLIE broke out, was slow
early, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and failed to rally. ATLATL was in tight at the start and improved position in an even effort.
BARELYSTILLCOUNTS was not a factor. PRINCE OTTO was through early. ARDIE THE LEGEND was fractious in the gate, broke awkwardly, was through
after a half, stopped and not urged late.

ADDYDIDIT drew clear on the turn, bore out entering the stretch and drew off in the drive. KYNLIE'S EMPIRE came in and was steadied at the start,
advanced outside to threaten, was carried out entering the stretch, fell back and continued willingly to the wire to earn place. SAVAGE LOVE came out at
the start, was void of early speed, closed inside and earned show. STOLEN HALO challenged for the lead on the turn, was carried out, angled back in, bid
and came up empty. LIP'S OF WINE was outrun in an even effort. PLUM ROSE bobbled at the start, was checked early, showed speed to the turn and
