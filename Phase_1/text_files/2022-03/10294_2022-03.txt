ZIGGY, forwardly placed three wide in the opening stages tracking just off the pacesetter, continued with a steady effort to challenge for command
approaching midstretch, then took over late under firm right handed pressure. EL GUAPO broke sharply, dictated the pace a bit off the rail racing to the turn,
came under stout pressure while shifting out resisting the winner's bid racing past midstretch but proved no match late. THE SKIPSTER swerved in at the
start, was urged along the inside prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch but steadily faded after a half. MANUKA BOBBY settled last on the
backstretch, switched out nearing upper stretch but passed only tiring rivals. FURIOUS FINNEGAN broke slowly and proved no threat. JUSTICE WARRIOR
angled inwards tracking just off the first flight through the backstretch and gave way after a half.

ST. PAT'S DAY tracked off the first flight four wide in the opening stages while under light rating, steadily advanced on the leaders three wide entering the
turn to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, took charge, then steadily widened her advantage on her own courage in a ridden out effort. BAILOUT
KELA was rated off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted out racing through the stretch to split foes three wide and prevailed for the place
honors late. MOON PARTY tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued well enough to earn a
share inside foes late. BAYOU MELODY was urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, proved no match for the
winner while pursuing that foe to midstretch and gave way late. SASSY CHARLEE, urged between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch, gave
way early. TWO SPOT, slow to gather stride, failed to menace. HAPPY RIDE dislodged her rider and ran loose in the post parade, necessitating her late
scratch.

Footnotes
XY SPEED was urged to a forward placing while angling to the inside in the opening stages, tracked just off the first flight racing into the turn, tipped out
three wide racing through the stretch and took over late to prevail by a clear margin in time under firm handling. SAVVY LAYLA was settled along the inside
racing to the turn, saved ground on the bend, tipped out entering the stretch and found his best stride in the closing stages to split foes three deep while
narrowly prevailing for the place honors. FOX ROX was rated between foes, then just off the first flight outside the eventual winner racing into the turn,
shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance and was outkicked by the top pair. FIG JELLY, forwardly placed four wide in
the opening stages, shifted in to force the pace outside a rival racing into the turn to strike the front nearing upper stretch, dueled for command past
midstretch and gave out late. HARD COUNT ducked out at the start crossing over the path of HELLFIRE BOB, was righted to track off the second flight
under light reserve racing into the bend, angled five wide in the stretch and continued with a mild bid. SAMAY was urged inside foes pursuing the leaders in
the opening stages, lost some ground when shuffled a bit avoiding tight quarters entering the bend, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing
response. MUDSLIDE WICKED, urged to gain the lead three deep in the opening furlong, angled to the rail once gaining a clear advantage, dueled for
command into the turn, then past midstretch but gave out late. HELLFIRE BOB, off slowly, then shut off at the start, raced four, then five wide to the stretch
and proved no threat.

Footnotes
KNIGHT OFTHE CROWN tracked off the first flight three deep racing through the backstretch, commenced a steady advance in that path racing through the
turn and wrested the advantage in time under firm encouragement. STYLE was urged along the rail to dispute the pace inside a rival through the
backstretch into the turn, edged forward midstretch but couldn't contain the winner. ITS OVER tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn,
saved ground while being prompted to advance inside foes entering the lane but lacked the needed final kick while altering course to the three path late.
MORE MUCHO broke readily to gain the advantage racing past the chute, prompted the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, but gave
way nearing midstretch. ROCKY DICE tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing through the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into
upper stretch but had no rally. MELINA'S DREAM angled to the inside tracking off the second flight on the backstretch but offered no rally. FIERCE
WARRIOR was settled last outside rivals and failed to menace.

SANDY LANE KITTEN, forwardly placed along the inside racing just off the pacesetter in the opening half, tipped out midway through the backstretch while
being prompted to advance, continued with a steady bid to challenge for command nearing upper stretch and narrowly prevailed between foes in a long
drive. FLY FLY AWAY broke readily, dictated the pace on a clear margin along the inside while under light rating to the backstretch, responded when
challenged to resist the winner's bid racing through the stretch but couldn't contain that foe while narrowly prevailing for the place honors. D'CRAZINESS
tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing through upper stretch while steadily
advancing on the top pair but was just outkicked. OUTRAGEOUS BET tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out three
wide nearing the far turn and continued willingly outside foes gaining position to the end. EL SAMURO settled along the inside early, was fanned six wide
into upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. OBIWAN settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled out to race five wide
between foes in the stretch to gain some position while making no real impression. ALBIE angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the
backstretch but lacked the needed late response. VAN proved no threat. KRAMDEN tracked the pace outside rivals in second flight and faded between foes
early.

Footnotes
IDEAL BREEZE was urged inside the pacesetter prompting that rival through the backstretch into the turn, pressed the issue while shifting a bit off the
inside entering the stretch, then edged clear late under pressure. R LOVE ON THE RUN broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin outside the
eventual winner through the backstretch, dueled for command through the turn to midstretch but proved no match late. J D'S VISTA, off slowly, settled last
racing to the turn, split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch and continued with late interest to gain position between foes to the end. BAHAMA
PEARL tracked off the first flight racing outside foes in the four path on the backstretch, was urged to advance in that path to lodge a brief bid nearing upper
stretch but flattened out late. BLUSHING KEYLEN angled inwards tracking off the first flight in early stages, saved ground through the turn to upper stretch
but lacked the needed late bid. DONTLOSETHATNUMBER tracked off the first flight in the three path between foes on the backstretch, was urged to lodge
a brief bid three deep between foes nearing upper stretch but proved empty in the drive. GONE DREAMING ducked out at the start, was collected to track
off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn but offered no rally. IMINCOMUNICADO angled inside settling off the second flight racing to the turn and
failed to menace. QUEEN TIGER tracked off the second flight between foes on the backstretch and faded early.

Footnotes
LUNA QUEEN broke sharply, stalked the pacesetter along the inside racing into the first turn, tipped out midway through the backstretch moving to terms
with that rival, pressed the issue between foes leaving the midway point of the far turn and edged clear in late stages under firm left handed encouragement.
HOITY TOITY tracked the leaders three wide between foes in second flight racing to the first turn, angled inwards after a half to track just off the second
flight racing to the far turn, split foes just off the inside racing through the stretch and edged rivals for the place honors late. MORGAN'S Z VA tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide steadily advancing on the leaders racing into the far turn, was fanned
four wide racing through the stretch and lacked the needed final kick. GIVEITSOMEWELLIE, caught four wide racing to the backstretch racing as part of the
second flight, was prompted to lodge a brief bid in that path nearing the far turn but had no closing bid. SENSIBLE MYTH angled to the inside tracking just
off the leaders racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn to make a brief bid inside foes near midstretch but soon flattened out. PROPER
MANNERS sped to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. NO SNIVELING was
settled outside a rival dropping well off the leaders to the far turn and never gained contention. MAGICGIRL broke awkwardly, was settled along the inside
and steadily faded into the stretch. PER RULING #2022-019795 FROM THE FLORIDA RACING COMMISSION, LUNA QUEEN WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
