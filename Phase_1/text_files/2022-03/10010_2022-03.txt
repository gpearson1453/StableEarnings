Footnotes
BURNIN TURF settled near the inside then moved to the two path, dove back to the rail in upper stretch, rallied up the inside, cleared with a sixteenth
remaining and held safely. GOLD PHOENIX (IRE) broke a bit slow, settled off the pace early on, angled out in upper stretch, rallied five wide and kept
gaining to the wire. ADARE unhurried in the beginning along the inside, angled out on the turn and came five wide into the stretch, steered widest in the
drive and got up for the show honors. CANE CREEK ROAD stalked near the inside then moved out and came three wide into the stretch, drifted inward and
was straightened out approaching the eighth pole, summoned a mild response and got edged for the show. SEE THROUGH IT dueled for command inside
a rival down the hill, held a short lead into the final furlong and weakened in the late stages. CALI BAY (IRE) settled off the rail, went three to four wide
leaving the bend and failed to produce a bid. SPIRIT MAKER tracked the pace on the inside then moved out a bit on the turn and failed to threaten.
SOUTHERN HORSE (ARG) broke slow from outside, raced off the pace in the early going, traveled five wide leaving the turn and took an awkward step
crossing back on to the turf and could not regain momentum. NEWPARK (IRE) dueled for command outside of SEE THROUGH IT down the hill, fought
back in upper stretch then weakened in the furlong grounds. CITY RAGE bobbled at the start, checked off heels early, angled out and came six wide into
the lane and was not a factor. RIVER TIBER broke slow and was tossing his head at the start, traveled near the back of the pack, came three wide into the
stretch and failed to menace. CONSTITUTIONAFFAIR tracked off the rail, entered the lane four wide and faded out of contention.

Footnotes
TAIBA came in and brushed rival early, dueled for command up the backstretch, vied with a pair of rivals while along the rail on the turn, inched ahead with
a quarter mile remaining, shook free at the top of the stretch and powered away. MAURITIUS broke a bit slow to begin, moved closer and went up outside
the top pair past the half-mile pole, vied three deep and bumped with rival around the bend, could not keep up with the winner in upper stretch and stayed
on to secure the place. PIONEERING PAPA got brushed from outside early, raced up close inside the top pair then chased behind those rivals into the turn,
got put in a bit tight near the quarter pole, remained inside and kept on through the lane to earn the show. ONE MORE BID got crowded a bit down along
the inside early, angled out at the half-mile pole, moved up but had to pause while lacking room early on the turn, angled out and came four wide into the
drive and flattened. MAGICNTHEMOONLIGHT showed early speed from outside and dueled for command, vied between foes and got bumped on the turn,
chased the leader two wide into the lane and faded. TENTH STREET DON settled off the pace, navigated the turn four wide and weakened. OVERRULE
got shuffled between rivals early, trailed three then two wide on the turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
SAVVY GAL dropped back off the pace, raced outside a rival then lost her path when STORMING LADY moved inward at the seven-sixteenths pole, went
three wide into the turn, moved to the two path then came out into the stretch, steered six wide in the lane, rallied and drew clear late. BRISTOL BAYOU got
forced in at the start, tracked between into the turn, two wide into the drive, steered to the inside, rallied up the rail and gained second.
MYLITTLERUNAWAY set the pace with company alongside, cleared midway around the bend, led into the final furlong, then lugged out and bumped rival at
the sixteenth pole and lost the place. STORMING LADY tracked three to four wide around the turn, moved out and raced widest in the drive and finished
willingly for a minor award. ON PURPOSE chased off the rail then angled to the inside for the turn, bid between rivals in the furlong grounds, got bumped by
MY LITTLERUNAWAY and crowded at the sixteenth pole and was ridden out to the wire. RESPECTFULLY pressed the pace from outside, chased the
leader leaving the turn, re-bid three deep in final furlong but got forced out and had to check near the sixteenth pole and could not regain momentum. SADIE
BLUEGRASS chased outside the top pair up the backstretch, went three wide around the bend, lost path and checked hard at the sixteenth pole and was
ridden out to the wire. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED MYLITTLERUNAWAY FROM THIRD TO LAST FOR SHIFTING OUT
AND INTERFERING WITH ON PURPOSE, RESPECTFULLY AND SADIE BLUEGRASS NEAR THE SIXTEENTH POLE.

Footnotes
CEZANNE pressed the pace from between rivals, vied for command around the turn, carried a short lead to the quarter pole, fought with PRINCIPE CARLO
in upper stretch, cleared in midstretch and drew away. PRINCIPE CARLO attended the pace outside the top pair, vied three deep around the bend, fought
back in upper stretch, proved no match for the winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. CANADIAN PRIDE set the pace under pressure from
outside, vied for the lead around the turn, could not keep up exiting the bend and weakened in the lane. WICKED TRICK was off a bit slow to begin, chased
four to five wide into the lane and could not rally. SHOOTERS SHOOT stumbled leaving the gate, recovered and went up to chase in range well off the rail,
went four wide around the turn and flattened out. PHANTOM DANCE settled early, traveled along the inside then two wide into the lane and lacked further
response.

Footnotes
LEGGS GALORE cleared quickly and angled to the inside, opened up around the clubhouse turn, led well clear to the stretch, remained unchallenged into
the final sixteenth, then held off the late charge from GOING TO VEGAS in the closing moments. GOING TO VEGAS stalked outside a rival through the
early going, entered the lane three wide, chased through the lane then put in a late bid but was not enough. CLOSING REMARKS rated early on the inside,
angled out on the far turn and came four wide into the stretch, closed well and got up for the show. MUCHO UNUSUAL settled off the pace outside a rival,
traveled three wide around the far turn, finished willingly in the final furlong but lacked room behind GOING TO VEGAS while hemmed in by CLOSING
REMARKS in deep stretch. CANOODLING broke through the gate and had to be reloaded, got shuffled between rivals early, was rated in the two path
outside a rival, continued two wide to the stretch, chased between in the lane and could not rally. AVENUE DE FRANCE (FR) was off a bit slow to begin,
raced in the two path near the back, angled three to four wide on the far turn and improved position. TONY ANN stalked the pace from inside, exited the far
turn in the two path and weakened down the lane. KEEPER OF TIME (IRE) saved ground off the pace, lacked room in the lane and never threatened. FAST
JET COURT (BRZ) broke slow, steered to the two path and failed to menace. MADONE was off a bit slow in the beginning, moved to the inside trailing the
field, came out and was driven three wide into the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
FORBIDDEN KINGDOM was off alertly and cleared nearing the first turn, padded the lead up the backstretch, opened up on the far turn, showed the way
two wide into the stretch and remained well clear under hand urging. DOPPELGANGER broke a bit slow, advanced inside on the far turn, angled out into
the stretch, could not threaten the winner in the stretch but proved second best. HAPPY JACK broke well, was forwardly placed from inside early then
dropped back off the pace, moved out on the far turn then drifted into the lane and gained the show. BEAUTIFUL ART fractious in the gate, hopped and
steadied when losing path at the start, trailed off the rail to the far turn, angled down to the two path under a drive on the second bend and showed a mild
response to round out the superfecta. CABO SPIRIT went four wide around the clubhouse turn, traveled three deep in the middle stages, got floated five
wide into the lane and weakened. ARMAGNAC was closest in pursuit from off the rail in the early going, dropped back on the far turn and tired. WORSE
READ SANCHEZ raced near the back, went two wide into the far turn, tipped three wide entering the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
WAR AT SEA settled early off the rail, ranged up four wide on the far turn, reached the front in upper stretch, cleared with a sixteenth remaining and held
safely. BALDORO was rank and pulling the rider along early, settled into a stalking position on the inside, pulled forward again at the half-mile pole, waited
behind rivals on the second bend, tipped out leaving the far turn, finished well but could not get by the winner. LIL BRO COOP was off slow and crowded at
the start, moved up to mid-pack on the backstretch, chased three wide into the drive and got outkicked for second. TUSKEGEE CAT showed early speed
and moved to the two path, rated off the rail in the early going, bid three deep on the far turn, led into the stretch, was overtaken in upper stretch and yielded
placings in the final sixteenth. TORAJIRO broke slow, tucked inside on the first turn, moved out on the backstretch, went two wide into the second bend,
steered out and came four wide into the lane and failed to rally. GOT THUNDER showed speed along the rail then ceded command around the first turn,
angled outside and flanked the leader up the backstretch, bid outside into the far turn, held a short lead at the quarter pole, relinquished the lead leaving the
turn and weakened down the lane. BARNFIELD raced off the rail off the pace, came four wide into the drive and was not a factor. LEGALLY REDDY broke
inward, was rank early then rushed up four deep, cleared and angled in around the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch, vied with rivals through the
far turn and gave way in the lane.

THAT'S AMARE hopped at the start, chased in the two path or between rivals on the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied three deep and got up late.
HONEY JAR stalked from outside, went four wide into the lane, took over at the top of the stretch, vied with a pair of rivals in the lane and was bested in the
final moments. THRUMPS DREAM (IRE) was off slow from outside, went four wide into the turn, moved to the three path, came back out and bid five wide,
entering the stretch, vied between rivals in the drive and got outkicked. TAMING THE TIGRESS steadied off heels early, angled in on the turn, steered near
the sixteenth pole and finished willingly for a minor award. KALON checked early, chased five wide into the turn, came six wide into the stretch, produced a
mild late bid but never threatened the top pair. ANOTHER EDDIE forwardly placed on the inside then two wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane and
lacked a serious bid. EVER SMART was forced to check twice early, saved ground then tipped out in upper stretch, lacked room near the eighth pole,
angled to the inside and could not rally. ZYDECO MAMA sat off the pace off the rail, lacked room behind a rival in midstretch, angled inward and could not
regain momentum. XMAS SURPRISE checked early, went four wide into the turn, got bumped from inside crossing the dirt and came six wide into the
stretch and could not summon the needed response. ALOHA KITTEN tracked three wide, drifted out and bumped rival crossing the dirt and failed to
menace. ULTIMATE HY got squeezed at the start, checked twice in the early stages, got crowded between rivals in upper stretch and could not recover.
MENDHAM MILL sped to the front, moved to the inside for the turn, came three wide into the stretch and gave way.

AS TIME GOES BY bumped VARDA and bobbled at the start, sent between rivals for the lead and cleared around the clubhouse turn, padded the
advantage and carried a comfortable lead into the second turn, roused along the rail entering the stretch, put to right and left-handed urging in the lane and
remained clear to the wire. MISS BIGLY brushed with ENVOUTANTE while three deep into the first turn then stalked between rivals around the bend, was
closest in pursuit in the two path on the far turn, took aim at the leader in the stretch but lacked the needed late kick in the final furlong. VARDA got bumped
leaving the gate, showed speed from inside then ceded control to AS TIME GOES BY on the first turn, chased along the rail into the far turn, angled three
wide around the bend and weakened. ENVOUTANTE raced four deep while brushing with MISS BIGLY into the first turn then chased the leader three deep
around the bend, continued outside rivals in the middle stages, lost ground leaving the backstretch, angled to the rail for the far turn, saved ground trailing
the field and had little left for the drive.

COUNT AGAIN settled off the pace, saved ground along the rail to the stretch, angled out at the three-sixteenths pole then closed fast from outside to be up
in time. SPACE TRAVELLER (GB) got shuffled between rivals early, moved down to the two path then along the rail, lacked room behind rivals at the
five-sixteenths pole, tipped two wide around the bend, steered out in the stretch, rallied three deep and got outclosed by the winner. SUBCONSCIOUS
broke well then got put tight by BEYOND BRILLIANT soon after the start and had to steady back, stalked from inside and saved ground to the lane, tipped
out in upper stretch, bid between rivals, battled to the wire and finished a game third. BEYOND BRILLIANT took control early, controlled the pace through
the early going, showed the way along the inside into the stretch, remained clear into the final furlong, challenged from outside with a sixteenth remaining
and yielded late. LAW PROFESSOR raced in range early off the rail, traveled three wide on the far turn then took aim two wide entering the stretch, got
crowded between rivals at the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. FLAVIUS came away slow, raced outside a rival or off the rail near the back,
lacked room to advance near the three-eighths pole, angled out and came five wide into the stretch and could not rally. DELAWARE (GB) broke slow from
inside, trailed on, swung out leaving the far turn and steered out widest in the drive and showed a mild response to improve position. BOB AND JACKIE was
fanned six wide entering the first turn, dropped back and angled to the four path, traveled four wide into the stretch, angled out in the drive and prove no
menace. WHISPER NOT (GB) was closest in pursuit in the two path, dropped back between rivals on the far turn and faded in the lane. TELL YOUR
DADDY went four then three wide on the first turn, traveled two to three wide on the far turn and weakened. TEAM MERCHANTS was fanned five wide into
the first turn then moved to the four path, traveled three then four wide on the second bend and weakened.

Footnotes
EXPRESS TRAIN tracked three then four wide on the first turn, bid three deep into the second bend, dueled with WARRANT past the five-sixteenths pole,
battled down the stretch holding a narrow advantage and gamely prevailed. WARRANT pressed between early, chased two wide leaving the first turn, drew
alongside the leader and applied pressure up the backstretch, took control with three furlongs remaining, dueled with EXPRESS TRAIN on the far turn,
battled down the stretch and got edged by the winner. STILLETO BOY trailed three wide into the first turn then went outside rivals, moved into range up the
backstretch, driven three wide into the lane and bested the rest. SPIELBERG came away slow then was hustled to the front from inside, lost command
around the clubhouse turn and chased the leader into the backstretch, got blocked behind AMERICAN THEOREM on the far turn, tipped out and came
three wide into the stretch, moved out further in the lane and improved position. WHY WHY PAUL WHY tracked along the inside then a bit off the rail into
the backstretch, got asked two wide around the far turn and weakened in the lane. AMERICAN THEOREM pressed the pace three deep early, moved up to
take control and cleared briefly at the three-quarter pole, set the pace under pressure from WARRANT up the backstretch, relinquished control to that rival
at the three-eighths pole, lost ground and positions through the far turn and tired in the drive. SOY TAPATIO chased two to three wide then between rivals
on the first turn, forced to steady early on the backstretch, trailed three wide into the lane and made no impact.
