Footnotes
DEAREST KITTEN broke sharply speeding to a solid early lead maintaining the margin to the far turn being threatened near the quarter pole drifting wide
into upper stretch forcing rival to go wider shaking off an inside challenge to reestablish command a sixteenth out winning under a hand ride. WEEKEND
PASS slow early gave a mild rally to upper stretch giving steady surge the final eighth to save place. VOODOOISM slow early saved ground surging to
threaten along the rail in upper stretch being turned back by the winner before weakening late. BELLS OF JOY stalked the pace edging closer on the far
turn, was forced to go wide as the leader drifted into upper stretch losing momentum there finishing evenly. YARMA D' BOSS raced evenly off the pace
through the far turn, had faded when pinched between horses near the eighth pole. MOCHA slow early was always outrun racing wide to upper stretch
angling back inside squeezing rival near the eighth pole. POST CODE ENVY tracked early then dropped off on the far turn, encountered traffic being put in
close near the eighth pole.

Footnotes
RUN AWESOME TIZ stalked the pace through the turn vying four deep in upper stretch edging up gamely in the closing yards. COMPANYS COMING sent
clear set the pace coming under pressure outside the quarter pole, shook clear on the inside in upper stretch digging in from the two path late unable to hold
under outside pressure. JILLY FROM JERSEY a step slow through the turn lost ground to upper stretch finding late response to close with a rush at mid
track. FRIDAY slow early raced wide to upper stretch finding belated surge in the six path. TALKBACK chased the pace through the turn into upper stretch
weakening late on the inside. BEND THE KNEE stalked the pace pressing hard to the quarter pole, rebuffed in upper stretch would weaken late in the three
path. CASCABRIA slow early played no factor. SWEET BELEN was always a step slow. TWO DIAMONDS was always outrun.
