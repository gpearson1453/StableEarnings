Footnotes
DOCTOR LEE went evenly through the backside giving a quick advance to the quarter pole wresting the lead in upper stretch showing full of run from there
to win going away. SHELL FIRE a step slow through the far turn came five wide into upper stretch finding belated response angling in a bit getting up for
place. SMASH set the pace on a short lead to the far turn, collared near the quarter pole would cede grudgingly along the inside in upper stretch before
wearing out late. FRITTONS GOLD well back early lagged through the far turn losing ground to upper stretch improving with even action the final eighth.
BOB'S CALLING slow early gained on the inside on the far turn then leveled off through the lane. NOD TO PERSIA stalked the pace chasing on the far turn
before giving way in upper stretch. FORT RAMSEY played no factor.

Footnotes
EARLY BLOOMER stalked the pace looming close through the turn losing ground to upper stretch rallying clear late six wide. KLEONA away alertly set the
pace holding daylight through the turn widening some in the four path upper stretch being overpowered from the outside late. LUCKY PENNY ROSE a step
slow early was hustled on the turn giving even action through the lane to best the others. LATE DATE raced evenly throughout lacking more. GOLOSA slow
early played no factor. HAUGHTY PRAISE was never involved. CABARET FLEUR hustled along chased through the turn wearing out to upper stretch. EAT
MY DUST gave way on the turn.
