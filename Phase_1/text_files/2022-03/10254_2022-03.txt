TAKE CHARGE DEPUTY Settled in rear early and was passed to be last at the half-mile pole while in the six path, was asked at the five-sixteenths pole
and then commenced a bold, sweeping move at the quarter pole, strongly to wire. SWITCH BACK Dueled inside from the break until the three-sixteenths
pole when overtaken by winner but nevertheless held place. OVER EZ Dropped back early and moved up on the backside two wide to be second last,
showed late interest in lane to get up for third. EMPEROR'S CHOICE Tracked along the rail into the first turn and maintained that position throughout,
showed mild late gain inside of rivals but could not match the rest. TIME TO ZOOM Dueled outside of rival from break until three-sixteenths pole when
passed by eventual winner, gave way when headed. FIGHT ME Stalked two wide into the first turn and throughout the backstretch in the three path, moved
up at the five-sixteenths pole to challenge for the lead, gave way at the eighth pole.
