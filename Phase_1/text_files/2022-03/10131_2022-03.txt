Footnotes
AMERICAN BOURBON sprinted clear, led throughout with a long lead, was tiring and held well. IF YOU WANT IT raced mid pack, bid off the rail leaving the
turn, lacked the needed late response and finished second best. IT'S ALEXUS was unhurried early, went six wide leaving the turn and finished well. SILLY
NOTION rallied inside on the turn, angled out, bid and came up empty. SURE ANGEL settled off pace, saved ground and lacked a stretch response. PIPER
ROSE was outrun in an even effort. LUCKY STEPPER advanced to the second turn, had nothing left and stopped. Hand timed.

closed well to finish second best. MICKEY DOBBS was never far off the pace, closed along the rail, lacked the needed rally and held for show. HAPPY AT
SHADY raced outside, went ten wide at the top of the stretch and closed steadily. WIN LIKE COACH P raced in the back, went eight wide at the top of the
stretch and lacked a bid. SPECIAL LESSON was not a factor. CANDY RUNNER raced close to the pace, lacked a stretch response and fell back. LA

Footnotes
THIRTY SECONDS OUT dueled to the second turn, drew off and extended his lead under left handed urging. WE'RE JUST SAYIN stumbled at the start,
raced in the back, went eight wide entering the stretch and closed to get up for place. RIDEO advanced outside to the second turn to challenge for the lead,
fell back, finished evenly and settled for show. ROWDYROOSTER improved position in an even effort. PAYNTER'S BOY was not a factor. REAL GLITTER
was not a factor. SILENT MUSKETIER saved ground, was through early and dropped back. OSTINI was in tight on the first turn, raced inside, advanced to
the turn and stopped. MO BOB (IRE) dueled inside to the second turn, stopped and was not urged late.
