Footnotes
EASY TO BLESS was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, rushed up on the outside while tugging at the bit, took the lead at the nine-sixteenths,
went clear in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive then widened, drifted out under a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker
then was straightened by the rider, was given one last pop of a left-handed crop just inside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride to the wire
while much the best. SHESALITTLE EDGY moved in while showing good speed and set the early pace, lost the lead at the nine-sixteenths, dropped behind
the winner while inside on the turn and proved no match while clear for the place. SWEET MIA bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the
pace, raced between horses passing the seven-sixteenths, dropped back three to four wide under strong urging on the turn and came up empty while best
of the rest. ITS COLD IN DEHERE was coaxed along near the back, raced inside to the two path on the turn and had nothing left. MY GIRL LEXI bumped
with a foe at the start, settled under some urging, came under stronger encouragement while in the three path on the turn and failed to respond. CAZILDA
FORTYTALES angled in while showing early speed then chased the pace, dropped back abruptly while faltering badly on the turn and was pulled up then
collapsed fatally after the rider had dismounted.

Footnotes
WITCH HUNTER six paths off the inside down the backstretch, advanced five to six wide through the turn into contention with three furlongs to run, angled
in taking over command swinging three then two wide straightened away into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was geared down inside the final
sixteenth to prevail comfortably on the wire. INDIAN BELLA coaxed from the gate, chased just off the pace four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive improving position and just held for the place honors at the finish. SNIFF six then five
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide put to coaxing half a mile from home, swung five wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to
just miss for the place honors. AWESOMENEWYEAR five wide in aim of the leader, advanced through the turn prompting that rival before taking over
command just inside the three-eighths pole, yielded the front near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened to the
finish. STARSHIP REINA chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and tired. INVESTMENT GRADE stumbled at the start and came under coaxing to establish the front to show the way in hand five then
four wide down the backstretch before briefly tucking three wide at the nine-sixteenths, took to the two path into the turn and came under increasing
pressure yielding command just inside the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch backing away, then folded in the stretch.

Footnotes
HONEY MONEY hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand three paths off the inside under some pressure from GRINGOTTS to the outside, tucked to
the two path through the turn and came under increasing threat from the runner up to the outside under light coaxing from the three-eighths, got displaced
from command spun just off the inside into upper stretch, altered in slightly as CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE came in slightly under a right handed crop at the
three-sixteenths, came again to issue a challenge a furlong out and was placed in tight briefly inside the eighth pole before seizing the front nearing the
sixteenth pole for good, then edged clear to the finish kept to task. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE four to five wide in aim of the leader down the backstretch,
commenced a four wide advance from the seven-sixteenths to issue a challenge and take command near the quarter pole, spun three then two wide into
upper stretch in front, came in slightly under a right handed crop at the three-sixteenths forcing HONEY MONEY to alter slightly inwards, dug in under threat
and tightened the inside on that rival just inside the eighth pole, yielded the front soon after and kept on to just preserve the place honors on the wire.
GRINGOTTS prompted the leader from the outside four wide, tucked three wide and raced between foes as the aforementioned foe advanced outside and
was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, got shaken off a bit by the top pair nearing the quarter pole, went three wide at that station, tipped out two paths
straightened away and came again to miss for the place honors. DARIA'S ANGEL chased two to three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out to the five path straightened away and weakened. BEE BIT
seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, chased two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and offered no response. GAME THEORY coaxed from the start, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four
wide through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, went five wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

in outside the furlong marker and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. TIERGAN moved out then settled on the outside, was urged along
passing the half-mile pole, went five wide on the turn and finished willingly for the place. HAMMERIN AAMER broke in at the start, settled towards the rear
on the outside, was urged along in the three path through the turn, turned into the stretch under a strong drive and lacked the needed response while able to
get the show. PIER FORTY broke in then bumped with an outer foe after the start, was urged along towards the back, went three then four wide on the turn,
drifted out some around the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten while improving position. JOHNNYPUMP came in at the start then bumped with an
opponent and was last away, angled in towards the rear, went four then five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. STRIKING SPEED broke in at the start,
prompted the pace on the outside, was urged along in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired. SPECTATORLESS was
bumped in the hindquarters at the start, showed the way while inside a foe down the backstretch, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, lost
the lead near the quarter-pole and gave way. AMERICAN LINCOLN brushed with a foe just after the start, was well placed in the early going, dropped back
under urging with five furlongs to run, went two to there wide on the turn and had nothing left. FAST BREAK tossed his head while rank under restraint in the
chute and was taken up around the seven-eighths, climbed while dropping back inside the three-quarter pole, saved ground on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
AWESOME INDRA moved in while showing speed, pressed the pace on the outside then drew even with the leader, vied in the three path on the turn,
shook clear when asked for her best in upper stretch and held under strong urging. OK HONEY chased the pace on the outside then four wide around the
turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. SHASTA STAR was hustled from the start then urged along off the
pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch then moved out a bit more and lacked the needed response while able
to get the show. SHADOLAMO brushed with a foe at the start, settled at the rear of the field, dropped from the three path to the rail early on the turn, saved
ground from that point into the stretch and failed to threaten. BUSTIN BAY was hustled from the start then carried in some early, dropped off the pace under
coaxing, went three wide on the turn then was driven four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. COVER PHOTO brushed with an opponent at the start
while last into stride, was urged along on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to threaten. QUALITY
STONES went to the front, set the pace on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path while still inside that rival while losing the advantage on the turn, dropped
back then moved out into upper stretch and faded.

BLEWITT just off the pace four wide past the stands for the first time, tucked to the two path through the first turn before making his way three wide down
the backstretch, continued three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced to take command continuing three wide into
upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. AIR ATTACK coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to chase the winner home along clear of the rest and second best. THERISASTORMBREWIN
established the front crossing to show the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits, remained patiently handled until under pressure for the initial
time and was placed to coaxing just off the inside three furlongs from home, got headed for the front spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, then
weakened in the final furlong while just preserving the show honors. ORIGINAL INTENT two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals missing for the show honors at the end. ROMAN EMPIRE
chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. GIOCARE four to five paths off the inside past
the stands the initial time, tucked to the inside through the first turn and then chased two to three wide from the backstretch on forward, came under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home and tired. FLEET IRISH two to three wide early on, went four wide through the first turn before
chasing four to five wide down the backstretch and through the far turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. BAR FOURTEEN forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in retreat, folded, and was eased home to the finish. BELLAMY DOLCE three then two wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing half a mile from home, swung three wide at the quarter pole, made no impact and was eased to the wire. SUPER JOHN just off
the pace tracking along the inside, began to fade after completing the opening three-quarters, continued along the inside through the far turn and into upper
stretch, faltered, and was eased to the finish.

best into upper stretch, took the lead outside the furlong marker and prevailed under strong urging. ZOOMER was urged along at the rear, raced inside to
the two path on the turn, gained under a drive into the final furlong and finished well for the place. SON OF AN EX broke a step slow, settled on the outside,
went five wide on the turn, gained into upper stretch, loomed bodly into the final furlong but flattened out and was out-kicked while clear for the show. REPO
ROCKS was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, angled in inside the three-quarter pole then moved up to dispute the pace, was eased back at the
nine-sixteenths, chased in the two path through the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. PRINCE JAMES moved out
near the five-eighths, settled off the pace, advanced closer while four wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response.
MEXICAN WONDER BOY was hustled to the front, set the pace under some pressure, moved clear at the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two
path, was challenged by the winner inside the three-eighths then shaken up inside the five-sixteenths, came under the crop in upper stretch, lost the lead
