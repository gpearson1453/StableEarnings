CHASING FAME was never far off the pace, rallied on the turn, went five wide entering the stretch, closed willingly and drew clear near the sixteenth pole.
ARABIAN STORY pressed the pace three across, dueled through the stretch and yielded near the sixteenth pole to finish second best. THIEF IN THE
NIGHT vied between horses, dueled through the stretch, weakened late and held for show. CAIRO KING saved ground, angled out in the upper stretch, bid
seven wide and passed a tiring rival. CLASSY CLASS set a pressured pace, dueled through the stretch and faltered near the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
HAVE A LIL PEPPER set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. ROYAL SEEKER chased the pace, put in a
steady effort and narrowed the gap to finish second best. GATO DE RAYO pressed the pace between horses, fell back, leveled off in the drive and held for
show. SNIGGLE raced three wide between horses, fell back on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and gave way. FORTY FATHOMS broke
awkwardly to be away slowly, raced in the back and lacked a bid. VIX HERO pressed the pace while racing four across to the turn and gave way. WILD
WILD KINGDOM trailed the field, lacked a response and showed little.

Footnotes
FIONA BAY raced in the back, rallied around the turn, bid six wide, dueled late and prevailed in a game effort. PAYNT THE KITTY assumed command
along the backstretch, inched clear entering the stretch, responded to duel late and was outnodded to just miss. O SHUGAH MINT lagged early, advanced
inside on the turn, bid to loom a threat, hung and held safely for show. INDIAN AFFAIR stalked the pace while racing inside, dropped back and gave way.
FIVE CIRCLES showed speed to the turn and stopped. ASEAAWINNER was not a factor. KEEPONROCKINMEBABY veered out at the start while getting
away well, led early and stopped on the turn.

Footnotes
CAMEO SHORES raced three wide between horses, rallied on the turn to challenge, dueled to the sixteenth pole and drew clear. PREDETERMINATION
was void of early speed, bid off the rail, found her best stride late and was gaining ground. WAR MAIDEN set the pace, responded when challenged to duel,
faltered and finished best of the rest. BLAZING MISS JOJO pressed the pace to the turn, dropped back and had no further response. SUGAR ON TOP
broke slowly and was outrun in an even effort. OLD WEST pressed the pace while racing inside and stopped on the turn. LETS PARDI MARTI raced close
to the pace towards the outside and had brief speed only.

Footnotes
COLONEL MIKE was never far back, advanced to the turn, angled out, bid six wide, closed willingly, got up late and won going away. HAMMERING
LEMON vied inside to the turn, drew clear, led to deep stretch and was outclosed to finish second best. ABANDONED was void of early speed, went seven
wide entering the stretch and finished well. DON WITH THE WIND vied between horses, dropped back along the backstretch and had nothing left for drive.
BLAME THE DEVIL moved up to challenge three across, dropped back entering the stretch and faded through the stretch. NOT NECESSARILY carried out
badly on the first, raced in the back, went widest in the drive and failed to contend. KING OF WISHES bore out badly on the first turn, raced in the back, was
eased in the stretch and walked off. Hand timed.
