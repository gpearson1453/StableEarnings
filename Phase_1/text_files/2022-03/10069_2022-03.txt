Footnotes
DUTCH TREAT off a step slow, raced back, steered out to be five wide into the turn, steady advance to challenge three wide into the stretch, kicked steadily
clear while kept to pressure. PROUD VICTORIA lacked early foot off the inside, three to four wide exiting the turn, rallied widest to be clear for the place.
TAILORBESWIFT pressed the issue early while between horses, vied into the lane in the two path, could not match the winner the final furlong, drifted out
under a left handed crop with a sixteenth to run while clear, weakened to lose the place, narrowly held the show. TIGER BAIT behind the pace while racing
along the inside, steered out for the drive, steadied slightly when TAILORBESWIFT drifted out with a sixteenth remaining, finished up evenly. PRINCESS
LILLI BUG prompted the pace in the three path for a half and began to tire. VERY SPICY back off the pace and the inside, fell back a bit in the two path
turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals through the stretch while never a factor. MO MONEYHONEY off slowly, raced in the second flight well wide in the run
up the backstretch, four down to three wide turn, had little for the drive. WILLOW MOON broke on top, showed the way for a half along the inside, gave way
in the drive. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
STOCK DEAL off a beat slow, moved out and raced three wide through the first bend, raced unhurried up the backstretch, rallied three to four then back to
three wide through the second bend, challenged into the lane, shook clear under steady pressure. FOXY ACE forward from the start off the inside, narrowly
showed the way the middle half while in the two path, had little for the winner into the lane, shifted out, no match in the run to the wire, fully extended to
retain the place. REVENIO settled off the pace and the inside early, moved to the rail second turn, steered out a bit turning for home, made a bid for second
outside the runner up late, outkicked late. EGOMANIAC void of speed, trailed for six furlongs toward the inside, angled out to be three wide late in the final
turn, came four wide for the drive, improved position with some belated interest while not a serious threat. GAINER settled off the pace and the inside, three
wide turning for home, failed to muster a response when set down. SOUTHERNER dueled up front along the inside with the runner up, caved in stretch.
KAT'S HITMAN raced in the second flight while outside, gave way in the far turn.

Footnotes
CHISHOLM TRAIL settled off the pace and the inside to be three wide first turn, closer second turn, dropped in a bit into the stretch, challenged along the
rail late, proved narrowly best in a game effort. MY FAVORITE UNCLE lacked early foot inside, moved out for the run into the far turn, three to four wide
advance through that bend, challenged on the outside of two rivals late, missed. PIZZA CHARLIE closest to the leader toward the inside, took over from that
one in the two path second turn, clear past the furlong marker, drifted then was caught while between the top two at the wire. LOVING LUCKY in mid pack
while off the inside through the first turn, continued one paced in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, saved ground through the second turn,
went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. DREAMER'S DELIGHT lacked speed, saved ground both turn, moved out a bit for the drive, had
little for the run to the wire. TANGO KILO unruly in the gate, broke back, was never a threat while racing well out in the strip. QUARANTINE WHISKEY
sprinted well clear past the wire the first time, maintained a sizable advantage in the run up the backstretch, gave way readily when headed final turn.
MOONSHINE SURFER off a step slow, remained always back.

Footnotes
JERRY'S EIGHTY allowed the pace to go early while outside, came four wide into the stretch, set down, lodged an outside bid past the furlong marker, drew
clear to the wire to win going away. SWIFT TAP prompted the pace while racing outside, three wide through the turn, took over on the outside when
straightened for home, showed the way past the furlong, proved no match for the winner late, clearly second best. BEEASY away in good order, set or
forced the pace off the inside for a half then began to weaken, continued to falter down the lane. TURNSANDCONDITIONS back off the early pace toward
the inside, angled four wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally when called on. BANJO BEAR broke best of all, raced with the pace along the inside for
a half and gave way. CATCH THE SMOKE off a step slow, moved out, was floated out further late in the turn by TURNSANDCONDITIONS turning for
home, remained back in trailing home.

Footnotes
CUMBERLAND AVENUE off a step slow, moved up, between horses into the turn, in some traffic late in the bend, split foes into the lane, engaged the
leader with a sixteenth to run from the outside, wore that rival down. WOBBERJOD broke well, dueled up front off the inside, disposed of the other speed
past the furlong marker, responded when confronted by the winner late, proved stubborn. LATIN CASINO moved up inside to duel up the backstretch,
alternated from the rail through most of the turn, could not match the runner up through the stretch, saved the show. SPACE ODESSEY lacked speed off
the inside, came four wide out of the turn, improved slightly while never dangerous. TOTALIZER off step slow, trailed most of the way just off the inside,
picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. BASEBALL POLITICS in the second group while racing four wide into the turn, closer in the three
path late in the bend, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. FIVE DREAMS headed up; the second flight just off the inside, had little for the drive.

Footnotes
SOPHIE'S ANGEL back off the pace and the inside, steered four wide midway on the turn, lodged a bid while widest of the first flight past the furlong
marker, proved best while fully extended. KASSERINE PASS forwardly placed in the three path for a half, challenged inside the winner and between rivals
with a furlong to run, held on in game fashion to miss. JETS A GINNIN pressed the issue early inside, vied through the turn while continuing to save ground
showed the way nearing the furlong grounds while remaining along the inside, gave ground grudgingly to the top two. TEXAS RAIN off a step slow, raced off
the inside to be four wide midway on the turn, angled in a bit late in the bend, went evenly through the stretch. MIDNIGHT KARMA lacked speed along the
inside, was never dangerous while improving only slightly. TAPALONG off a step slow, never menaced in the three path. BETCHA showed up the
backstretch between horses, continued in the two path turn, gave way from between rivals late in the bend. LIL MISS HOT MESS four to five wide early in
the turn when off the pace, gave way.

COST A FORTUNE off a slow, raced back early, advanced on the outside into the stretch, engaged the early early nearing midstretch, gained the
advantage then was fully extended to last for the dead heat. TRULY A ROCKET sprinted clear after the start, showed the way into the turn in the two path,
headed inside the furlong grounds, then battled back in determined fashion to earn part of the dead heat. CANT BE TOUCHED prompted the issue while
racing three wide into and through the turn, no match for the top two in the drive, far clear of the rest. CYPRESS QUEEN one paced while four wide into the
turn, three wide exiting, continued in even fashion to the wire in lacking a closing response. ESSENTIAL BELLA within striking distance early while inside,
tired in the drive. ICE BABY off bit slow, made little impact while racing three wide. MUMBLEBEE was finished early to be outrun while five wide throughout.

ACTING OUT moved up to take control after the start, set the pace in the two path, responded when challenged stretch, dug in late to prevail in game
fashion. JOY'S ROCKET back off the early pace inside, moved out turning for home, engaged the winner from the outside and between foes inside the
furlong marker, denied, held sway for the place. LI'L TOOTSIE last to leave, raced back early toward the inside, angled out four wide late in the turn, lodged
a brief and mild bid outside the top two approaching midstretch, hung the final furlong. HEADLAND chased the winner early off the inside, had little left for
the drive. RING LEADER within striking distance early three wide, began a steady fade after a half.

Footnotes
BELLAMYS ROAN prominent from the start from the outside, kicked strongly clear under steady handling. BETTYS CASH back off the pace, moved off the
rail early in the turn, rallied for the place, no threat to the winner. KISSOFTHENILE last to leave, lacked speed, lodged a belated rally to finish best of the
rest. SKYPED in mid pack into the turn just off the inside, improved position while not having enough for the show. EV'S SHERMAN prompted the pace
three wide and inside the winner, tired in the drive. MO VODKA appeared to race one paced while off the inside. FORSAKEN broke in good order, raced
with the pace between foes early, backed up through the stretch. ATTA PARTY broke alertly, with the early pace off the inside, also gave way. THE BUS
made little impact while five wide through the turn. BILLHILL four wide into the turn, lacked a rally. GENTLEMENS JET broke in good order, raced forward
early then began a steady retreat. MACER THE RACER stopped, jogged in. RUNNING POSITIONS OMITTED DUE TO HEAVY SNOW.
