Footnotes
FAIRY DUST was placed on the lead inside, set the pace while prompted by WAVERLY SUNSET, vied inside of that foe from the three eighths to the top of
the lane, began to drive clear approaching the three sixteenths, drifted out slightly but nonetheless held sway. LIFE ON THE EDGE settled at the rear, was
pushed along in the four path on the turn, continued to give chase outside in the lane, gave her best in the final furlong, and reeled in WAVERLY SUNSET
in the final fifty yards. WAVERLY SUNSET tracked the pace outside of FAIRY DUST, engaged outside that foe near the three eighths while racing in the
three path, vied from there into the lane, was no match from upper stretch, chased on, flattened in the final furlong and lost the place late. SMOKIN CLASS
chased inside, was outpaced into the turn, trailed inside around the bend, went to a drive in upper stretch and had no response.

Footnotes
JESSE THE GREAT was pushed along hard inside early, tracked the pacesetter inside of MAGICALLYDELICIOUS down the back straight, continued to
track the pace in the three path on the turn, launched a bid outside the leader near the quarter, led past the three sixteenths, and drew off under vigorous
hand urging until being wrapped up in the last few strides. MAGICALLYDELICIOUS tracked the early pace outside of JESSE THE GREAT, lost ground
while racing in the three path near the three eighths when the rider lost an iron, was driven into the lane while between horses in the rear line, never
threatened JESSE THE GREAT but chased on best of the rest. SUNSHINE BAY settled at the rear, raced into the turn outside of LA DAME, chased in
second last in the four path around the bend, raced three wide into the lane, and lacked the needed kick. ARTEMIS RISING soon led, set the pace in the
back straight and in the two path on the turn, was engaged past the quarter by JESSE THE GREAT, could not hold that foe at bay past the three sixteenths,
and emptied out inside. LA DAME chased between horses early, settled back and joined inside of SUNSHINE BAY in the rear pair near the nine sixteenths,
raced at the rear in the two path on the turn, was driven inside foes into the lane, offered no response and drifted out.

YANKEE JOE soon led, was pressed by NOT TO BLAME outside him from the five eighths, briefly lost the lead to that foe at the three eighths, dueled
inside him while saving ground around the bend, drove clear in upper stretch, was threatened by CALM DOWN near the sixteenth but kept finding enough to
hold the advantage. CALM DOWN chased the leading pair, began to edge closer to them in the three path from near the three eighths, swung three wide
into the lane, bid under a drive, loomed a threat approaching the sixteenth but could not reel in the leader. NOT TO BLAME tracked the pacesetter early,
turned up the pressure from the five eighths, briefly headed YANKEE JOE near the three eighths, dueled outside him while racing in the three path from the
three eighths to the head of the stretch, was no match for YANKEE JOE from the three sixteenths, loomed nearby to the sixteenth pole and flattened late.
COMPACT settled near the rear, chased well behind the leading trio in the three path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch but lacked the needed
rally. BLACKJACK HUNCHO broke slowly, trailed down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, had no response when briefly driven in upper
stretch and was allowed to trail home.

BESS chased three wide through the clubhouse turn, stalked outside of MINDING MILLIE down the back straight, bid outside of the pacesetter in the three
path approaching the three eighths, took over from there, kept on down the lane while drifting out, was confronted by MOMA TIGER to her outside in the
final furlong, but got the bob in the end. MOMA TIGER chased between horses through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, was urged for a bid
in the four path on the far turn and responded, continued to give chase to BESS down the lane, gained well on that foe in the final furlong but lost the nod.
FOLLY settled at the rear, chased five wide at the rear of a compact field down the back straight, continued toward the rear in the three to four path on the
far turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, proved no match for the leading pair under a drive but chased on best of the rest. MINDING MILLIE led
narrowly inside early, shook to a defined lead through the clubhouse turn, maintained the advantage down the backstretch and into the far turn, continued to
lead inside into the far turn, was headed at the three eighths and capitulated readily. MAD FOR FAME stumbled at the start, chased at the rear early,
advanced to midpack inside on the first turn, continued to chase midfield through the back straight, weakened in the two path on the far turn, swung out to
the six path in upper stretch and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
MY MAGICAL MAN raced at the inside of the tracking flight early, continued patiently near the half as INDEFATIGABLE and CALL THE SHERIFF launched
their bids outside of him, tracked the leading trio in the four path on the turn, floated into the lane in the six path, rallied under a drive and got up in the final
fifty yards. INDEFATIGABLE was fractious in the gate and backed out, was reluctant to load when being put back in the gate, broke inward and bumped
VENCIL in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair between horses down the back straight, launched a bid between horses near the half in tandem with
CALL THE SHERIFF, led at the seven sixteenths between horses, drove clear in upper stretch, but was caught late. CALL THE SHERIFF tracked the leader
three wide, made a three wide bid in tandem with INDEFATIGABLE near the half, prompted INDEFATIGABLE after that one took the lead at the seven
sixteenths, proved no match for the leader at the head of the stretch but chased on mildly as best of the rest. MISTER ARANGUIZ settled toward the rear
between horses, well behind the leading quad while racing down the backstretch, raced toward the rear into the turn, began to improve in the three to four
path on the turn, raced three wide into the lane, dropped to the inside in midstretch, and lacked the needed late kick to gain the show. KATZ ME KNOCKIN
bumped with VENCIL in the opening strides, settled at the inside of the rear flight, was urged to improve while saving ground around the far turn, was driven
two wide into the lane, drifted out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. NOTORIOUS REY led early, was headed by INDEFATIGABLE and CALL
THE SHERIFF at the seven sixteenths, readily backed up along the inside from there, and had no more when driven inside in the lane. VENCIL was
bumped between horses in the opening strides, settled three wide in the rear flight, trailed in the three path around the turn, swung five wide in upper stretch
and offered no rally.

Footnotes
MEMORY BOUQUET was forward three wide and engaged DON'T LOSEMYMONEY in a duel from the eleven sixteenths, came inward on TORPEDO
MAX near the half while still vying for the lead with DON'T LOSEMYMONEY, continued to vie two wide around the bend and into upper stretch, proved best
in the final furlong and edged away under a drive. DON'T LOSEMYMONEY broke sharply, dueled for the lead with MEMORY BOUQUET from the eleven
sixteenths while racing inside, continued to vie inside of MEMORY BOUQUET around the turn and into upper stretch, could not match that foe into the final
furlong and chased on second best. TORPEDO MAX attended the early pace between horses, steadied between foes at the half when MEMORY
BOUQUET came in, was pushed along to keep tracking the leading pair in the three path on the turn, proved no match past the quarter, chased on mildly to
prove best of the rest, fell past the wire, but walked off the track. SATCHEL DE RITCHES settled toward the rear of a compact field early, chased outside of
TORPEDO MAX while racing in the four path on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. MISTER GARY settled at the rear,
trailed in the two to three path on the turn, was pushed along approaching the three eighths but began to lose ground, swung out six wide into upper stretch
and had no bid under a drive.

Footnotes
LIME SQUASH prompted the pace between horses around the clubhouse turn, continued to prompt outside of SKY OF DREAMS down the back straight
and two wide on the far turn, was carried out by SKY OF DREAMS into the lane, kept on gamely outside of the pacesetter under a drive in the lane and
wore her down in the last jumps. SKY OF DREAMS set a pressured pace inside of LIME SQUASH and LIGHTNING ROUND around the first turn, continued
to set the pace inside while prompted by LIME SQUASH down the back straight and around the far turn, floated into the lane in the six path, maintained a
short lead under a drive for most of the stretch run, but could not hold off LIME SQUASH in the last strides. LIGHTNING ROUND was hustled for early
speed, attended the pace three wide around the far turn, settled pack to track the leading pair into the back straight, chased them while racing in the three
path around the far turn, was driven near the quarter, proved no match for the leading pair but kept on best of the rest. SAW chased behind the leading trio
outside of TALENTED TAPPER around the clubhouse turn, continued outside of that foe in the rear flight down the backstretch, chased in second last in the
three path around the far turn while pushed along, lacked the needed bid and was allowed to trail behind the leading trio late while still well clear of
TALENTED TAPPER. TALENTED TAPPER was reluctant to load, chased the leading trio inside of SAW, was steadily outpaced in the three path on the far
turn and had no more to offer in the lane.

Footnotes
HIPNOTIZADA was forward outside from the start, set the pace in the three path on the turn, began to open up on the rest of the field from the three
eighths, felt mild hand urging midstretch, and was wrapped up late. SINISE tracked the leading pair outside of GOLDEN LAW early, continued to chase
HIPNOTIZADA in the four path as he began to edge away, pursued the pacesetter under a drive while drifting out in upper stretch, and proved a clear
second best. FROSTED ANGEL tracked the leading pair inside of SINISE down the back straight, chased midfield in the three to four path on the turn,
floated into the lane in the six path, kept on chasing under a drive, proved no match for HIPNOTIZADA or SINISE but kept on with enough to capture the
show from GOLDEN LAW in the final sixteenth. GOLDEN LAW stalked the leader inside early, tracked while saving ground around the turn, began to lose
ground on the leader from the three eighths, chased under a drive from the three sixteenths, proved no match for the top two and lost the show in the final
sixteenth. MITTENSANDMUKLUKS settled near the rear, was pushed along in the four to five path in the rear flight on the turn, floated into the lane in the
six path, and lacked the needed kick between horses late. BIG CHEEKS settled at the rear, continued to trail while saving ground around the turn, was
driven from upper stretch but did not muster a rally.
