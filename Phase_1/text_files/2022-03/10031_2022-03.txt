COME SEE ABOUT IT dueled on the early lead, shook clear on the far turn, widened in the stretch under brisk handling to win as much the best. SEMI
CHARMED DAY was allowed to settle on the inside, saved ground in the stretch, was no match for the winner but was second best. PARADE GRAND
raced four wide and had a mild bid late. KING RICHIE contended for three quarters, then tired in the lane. O'HAIRE allowed to settle, failed to menace.
BORN TO BE KING never far back, lacked a late response. DON'T MATTER was no factor. VALEROSO dueled on the lead for five eights, then came up
empty.

Footnotes
DEXQUIRE was away alertly and quickly made the lead, led throughout and remained well clear under firm handling. ADMIRAL GLEN chased the winner
throughout, could not gain late but was second best. WHISKEY HELPS was allowed to settle early, swung wide in the stretch with a mild bid. NOSEY
POWER well placed and saved ground, had no rally. TAMMY'S TOY well placed early, lacked a late response. ARION MAXIMUS allowed to settle, failed to
menace. COUNT BRIAN raced mid pack for a half and tired in the stretch. KISS THE DEMON trailed.
