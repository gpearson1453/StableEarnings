Footnotes
TENNIS TAP closed to a slim lead leaving the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths,
was headed into the far turn, contested at a close disadvantage two deep through the turn, dug in to recover the edge mid-stretch and dueled clear later
yards. BAYS CASTLE settled off the early pace two deep, raced outside into the backstretch and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
appeared a close factor in the three path of the far turn and dug in to take second later yards. MAY MAYS CASTLE raced with the pace inside then
challenged at the three eighths pole and took the lead at the rail at the quarter pole, contested the edge through the far turn, was caught mid-stretch and
relented later yards. MOIRAINE stalked two and three wide on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened at the rail on
the far turn. MY SISTER PAM rounded the opening turn in the three path then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole, though,
flattened off the rail on the far turn. TIMETOGETUP saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far
turn about the three path, eased to the outside into the stretch and showed little further.

Footnotes
WALK A FINE LINE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and dug in under
steady stretch encouragement to defend. LOVE TO ZOOM came in to make contact with Magnificent Rocket in the vicinity of the three quarter pole then
stalked off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close into the stretch and finished evenly. IN TO THE NIGHT saved ground on
the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little further.
MAGNIFICENT ROCKET was bumped and steadied from tight quarters between horses in the vicinity of the three quarter pole then settled off the pace, bid
leaving the three eighths pole, though, flattened near the rail on the far turn. LADY SPARROW settled off the rail on the first turn, started a bid toward the
three eighths pole and raced close through most of the backstretch, but faded off the rail on the far turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the
rider of Love To Zoom, lodged by the rider of Magnificent Rocket and disqualified the former to fourth place, for coming in on the latter in the vicinity of the
three quarter pole.

THE BIG K cleared rivals toward the half mile pole and set the pace inside, came under pressure at the rail midway on the turn and was steadily
encouraged to hold on. PARISHIONER gave early chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the three path and was gaining steadily later yards.
RICHIE'S B L came away awkwardly then gave chase well off the rail, rounded the turn two deep, angled three wide into the stretch and dueled for third.
GOLDEN HUGHES chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. ZIP THE LIP chased outside, rounded the turn
in the three and four paths, angled to the six path leaving the turn and ran evenly through the lane. TANELEER chased and rounded the turn off the rail then
weakened past the eighth pole. SPLIT THE PACK gave early chase toward mid track, rounded the turn about the four path then weakened. HARTEL broke
outward and appeared to scrape the stall gate, chased outside down the backstretch, rounded the turn about the six path and showed little in the lane.

Footnotes
WILLIAM CROTTY was a bit reluctant to load then hit the gate upon exit and dropped well back from early contention, however, was well managed in a
steady advance to take the lead midway on the far turn, then well handled through the stretch. CRAZY IDEA settled back about the three path then bid
nearing the three eighths pole, improved in the four path of the far turn, was carried out entering the stretch but dueled for second mid-stretch. RIGHTEOUS
RENEGADE settled off the pace inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, appeared a close factor at the rail rounding the far turn, angled
to the four path approaching the top of the lane then flattened the final sixteenth. ADMIRE became fractious in the gate then broke inward to make contact
with Owl Run, took over approaching the first turn and rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, gave up the lead at the rail
midway on the far turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. GLAD MOON (GER) settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, was eased
to the six path toward the head of the lane and showed little more. GIO DUDE was bumped leaving the gate then settled close off the rail, picked up the
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, though weakened off the rail on the far turn. TIZEZZY steadied early and rounded the first two turns about the four
path, raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response. OWL RUN was bumped inward and into Gio Dude and rounded the opening turn about
the foru path, settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, gave chase into the second turn but showed little through the backstretch.

Footnotes
KITE SURFER was bumped leaving the gate, saved ground off the pace then bid from the seven sixteenths pole, closed the gap off the rail on the far turn,
dug in under steady handling from the eighth pole and got up the final strides. LIL MR MATT tapered in through the front stretch and rated the pace inside,
came under pressure approaching the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, dug in under steady handling from the top of the stretch but
was caught in the final strides. THORN OF ROSE HILL raced well back in the two and three paths the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole,
progressed steadily four wide on the far turn and was along for third under the wire. OMEGA GOLD was crowded early and settled off the pace about the
three path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, improved off the rail on the far turn, drifted a bit into the stretch and was nipped from third
under the wire. WEAVINTHEBLOCKS rounded the opening turn in the four path, bid toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the
three path then flattened the final furlong. MASTER YOO saved ground, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and
showed little further. ISLAND CADGER came away awkwardly and made contact with Kite Surfer, settled off the pace about the three path but was through
after a half mile. LUCKY PENGUIN raced well back saving early ground and never factored. JUST GETS BETTER stalked two deep then faded past the
three eighths pole.
