Footnotes
STRANGE ARRANGE crossed over causing chain reaction bumping, drew clear and proved much the best. MILITARY FORCE four wide run to turn, rallied
in the lane for place spot while no match for the winner. YANKEE MISCHIEF had an inside trip to the turn, exchanged bumps early and stayed on for third.
JACK BE NIMBLE three wide to turn, chasing leaders, wore down in the stretch while evenly. SEATTLESWAY never factored throughout. WATERBOY
between horses to the turn, bumped around out of the turn and flattened out. GIANT'S GATEWAY in tight after the start, raced evenly with no late gain.
BLUEBANK lost all chance early, checking up hard to avoid the rail out of the chute, far back throughout. HOW IT GOES in tight and bumped around early,
lost all chance while far back.

Footnotes
NEVER KNOW CHRISTY tracked to the turn, took up chase, strong urging for the nod on the wire. GUILDER shot to the lead, stayed to deep stretch,
outgamed to wire. BOOMTOWN no speed to the turn, came widest in the stretch for show spot. AKA LIONESS no speed to the turn, moved up a bit while
no real menace. ONE FAST ORB close up outside to the stretch with no late gain in the drive. ZIGGY'S STORM inside position close up, game stretch,
empty in final furlong. FANTASTIC RIVA tracked to the turn but faded back in the stretch run. UPSIDE DOWN chased pace to turn, could not keep up,
stopped readily.

rallied in the stretch for the place spot. WALLAHOLLY tracked to far turn, gained short lead quarter pole but weakened in the stretch run. HUQOOQ raced
evenly while inside with no late response in the stretch run. GOGO inside speed to the half but gave way readily and faded back. SUMMER AUTUMN

Footnotes
DISTINCTIVE FLOWER speed to set all pace, well handled through the stretch run to prevail on the wire in a sharp effort. BETHABARA no speed from off
rail, rallied into the stretch and finished well while coming on too late. DULCIMER DAME broke sharp, never far back throughout and proved best of the rest.
DARK TEMPTRESS had a slight bobble at the start, never a real threat in the stretch run. MY GOOD GIRL trailed to the stretch and improved position only
in the late going. GRANITE CANDY between horses to the turn, stayed well to deep stretch but faltered in the late going. STYLIN UPTOWN flashed brief
speed inside, have way quickly and dropped back. DOCS SEVEN up close from off rail to the stretch and gave way in the stretch run.
