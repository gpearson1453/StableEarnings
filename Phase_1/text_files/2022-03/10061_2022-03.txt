Footnotes
WINNING DRIVE hustled from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, tipped out
a furlong from home and steadily gained on the leader to collar that rival in the last jumps to the finish. KAREN'S COVE established the front and spurted
away in hand just off the inside widening through the turn, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused nearing the eighth pole, dug in under
lone threat and was caught in the final jumps to the wire. HEALY'S HOPE chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. BINKSTER coaxed from the start, chased four wide throughout under coaxing from midway on the turn
and offered no response. FLEET WARRIOR hustled from the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and weakened. CAUSE OF ACTION chased five wide throughout under a ride from three furlongs out and tired.

Footnotes
BAR FOURTEEN strolled to the front, was well rated on an easy lead, cruised around the turn a bit off the rail while the rest of the field was under strong
urging, responded well when set down outside the three-sixteenths, drew off under two successive pops of a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker,
widened under a brisk hand-ride into the final sixteenth, was given two more successive pops of a right-handed crop about fifty yards from the wire and
proved much the best. ROYAL REALM settled just off the pace on the outside, chased four wide under strong urging on the turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. QUICKFLASH brushed with a foe at the start, tracked the pace between rivals,
chased under strong urging while in the three path and tightly between horses on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved
no match then lost the place while just able to get the show. REMEMBERMOM was restless in the gate, brushed with an opponent at the start, was rated
between foes, chased in the two path while tightly between horses on the turn, fought for the minor awards in the stretch and just missed the trifecta while
well clear for the last superfecta position. PRAYER BOOK quickly dropped back while showing no speed then angled out, was hard ridden on the outside,
dropped back five wide on the turn and had nothing left. CENTAVO settled just off the pace on the inside, chased along the rail under strong urging on the
turn and faded.

Footnotes
MO DANCIN coaxed from the gate, ranged up to prompt the pace early on from the three path, steadily got shaken off a bit as a duel developed into and
around the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, seized command with three-sixteenths to go from
the embattled duo and edged away under a drive kept to task. UNCLE WATER FLOW chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung
five wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. SIR WILLIAM three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, briefly took to the rail midway on the turn before spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, then improved position to secure the show
honors. DEVIOUS BANKER four to five wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals.
WILD CARP DIEM stumbled at the start under hustling conceding two to three lengths to the front before making his way inside to advance into contention
near the nine-sixteenths, hooked up in head to head combat with DANCING WITH RICO at that station, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the
corner into upper stretch clinging to a narrow lead, got overtaken with three-sixteenths to run and tired. SELL SOMETHING hustled from the gate, chased
just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and tired. DANCING WITH RICO showed the way early on from
the two path under some pressure from MO DANCIN before being engaged by WILD CARP DIEM with nine-sixteenths to go, dueled with that rival coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got headed near the quarter pole and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.
RESERVATION hustled from the gate, chased four then three wide before tucking to the two path placed to urging at the nine-sixteenths, chased two to
three wide through the turn before spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN settled at the rear of the field, was roused while moving from three to five wide around the turn, bumped with GIRL OF
TOSCONOVA into upper stretch, rallied in tandem with that foe while on the outside into the final furlong, closed well to make a bid into the final sixteenth
and got up under strong urging. GIRL OF TOSCONOVA broke out at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the four path on the
turn, bumped with the winner into upper stretch, rallied in tandem while inside that foe into the final furlong, closed well to make a bid into the final sixteenth
and just missed while able to get the place. BELLA PRINCIPESSA bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, moved up outside the early leader to
press the pace, vied in the three path on the turn, drew even with the pacesetter at the five-sixteenths, gained a narrow advantage while brushing with TO A
T under a drive in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth-pole, brushed again with TO A T at that juncture and was overtaken while able to get the show. TO A T
moved in while going to the front, showed the way while inside of a foe, vied in the two path while still inside that rival on the turn, brushed with BELLA
PRINCIPESSA while under a drive in upper stretch, fought on well into the final furlong, brushed again with the aforementioned opponent into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished. FREDDYMO FACTOR broke out and bumped with a rival, was rated off the pace, lugged out some while two to three wide
on the turn and lacked the needed response. KINGDOM QUEEN dropped back under urging with six furlongs to run, moved in near the nine-sixteenths,
saved ground under urging on the turn, moved off the rail into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
HEY MAMA established the front showing the way just off the inside until tucked inside with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the three-eighths
under increasing pressure, got headed for command spinning just off the inside at the quarter pole, took back the front straightened away, dug in under
threat from a trio and held safe to prevail. LAOCHI chased just off the inside advancing to latch on the leader through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took narrow command swinging three wide into upper stretch before being displaced once more by the top one straightened away, dug in
under a drive fighting on loosely between foes to the wire to secure the place honors. STEPPIN' HAWK three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. BAVARIAN CREME chased four wide under coaxing from
the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was outkicked by the top trio while well clear of the rest. VIVAZANO chased
just off the inside until tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and offered no
response. MADAME ROSE got bumped askew at the start by ONE TRACK MINE due to pressure from WINTER SIREN breaking inwards, chased three
then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. ONE TRACK MINE got bumped at the start solidly
by WINTER SIREN and in turn bumped MADAME ROSE before being pinched back, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off
the inside through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, tipped four wide at the head of the stretch and tired. WINTER SIREN broke in at the start
bumping ONE TRACK MINE solidly into MADAME ROSE, chased six then five wide growing a bit rank when green with seven-sixteenths to go, tucked
briefly four wide before tipping out five wide once more into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
SHALIMAR GARDENS coaxed from the gate, settled four to five paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader, tucked three wide through the turn patiently
handled advancing on the front from the five-sixteenths, took over narrow command and was roused spinning four wide into upper stretch, drew clear under
a drive getting put to a light hand rider inside the final sixteenth. RAFFINITY showed the way in hand just off the inside early on before tucking along the
inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and came under increasing pressure from the top one to the outside, yielded the front
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for that rival while running on clear for the place honors. MIA BEA STAR got brushed at the
start by ENTER SANDWOMAN, who broke outwards, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages while clear for the show honors. ENTER SANDWOMAN broke out at the start brushing the aforementioned foe,
chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. VOICE OF SPRING four then three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. INOUAINTALKINTOME chased along the inside
under coaxing from midway on the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY JAZZ stalked the pace on the outside, ranged up three wide to make a bid with three furlongs to run then took the advantage, shook clear into
upper stretch, drew away under a drive until just before the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. REELEY PSYCHED settled off the pace,
was urged three wide on the turn then driven four wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. BLIND SIGHT chased
the pace down the backstretch, dropped back while moving from the inside to the two path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further
out and weakened but clearly held the show. MISS MALALA settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn and came up empty.
PLAYMAGGIEFORME showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead to the winner before the
five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and tired. HALF BIRTHDAY pressed the pace down the backstretch, dropped back in the two path on the turn
and capitulated. BEAUTIFUL BANKS was urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond. PALS ALLY broke awkwardly and
was off a bit slow, raced well back on the outside, went five wide on the turn and was no factor. GRACIE O'MALLEY was urged along towards the back,
rounded the turn in the two path and also failed to respond. MISS FLINTSHIRE moved in while urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and
never reached contention. PRINCESS RILEY was urged along off the pace, dropped to the rear on the turn and was pulled up then vanned off.
