Footnotes
EISELE was pinched back at the start then saved ground on the first turn, started a drive leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved and raced off
the rail on the far turn, dug in for the lead past the eighth pole and drew off with steady encouragement. LIL MR MATT saved ground on the first turn, dueled
for the lead two deep approaching the quarter pole, but was caught past the eighth and weakened from mid-stretch. TOWERING CHANCE stalked from the
nine sixteenths pole, bid leaving the seven sixteenths and had range in the three and four paths of the far turn, though flattened the final furlong. IN THE
GOSPEL settled off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and showed little more. CROSSTHEBAY
became a bit edgy in the gate, closed to the front approaching the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace from that point, came under pressure at the
seven sixteenths, was caught at the rail nearing the quarter pole and faded readily on the far turn. MR. HOSTLER broke inward and raced just off the pace
in the three and four paths the first turn, then faded through the backstretch.

GOLDEN KEY angled in early and set a pressured pace off the rail, dueled clear toward the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn and was
steadily handled to widen. CAIRO CALLING was shuffled back and steadied past the half mile pole, quickly recovered stride to give chase, rounded the turn
off the rail and finished well. DAN THE MAN CAN steadied at the inside flank of Cairo Calling in the vicinity of the half mile pole, gave chase toward the
three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the turn and finished well. PETE THE BEAST pressured the pace inside but dropped back at the five sixteenths
pole, raced at the rail on the turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. STRETCH THE TRUTH steadied on the chute then angled to the outside to give
chase, rounded the turn about the five path and finished evenly; widest. UNCLE ROAMIE gave close early chase then faded toward the turn. The Stewards
reviewed claims of foul against the riders of Cairo Calling and Golden Key, lodged by the rider of Dan The Man Can. Also, there was a claim of foul against
the rider of Golden Key, lodged by the rider of Cairo Calling. In summation, Golden Key was disqualified to third place for causing a chain reaction that

Footnotes
LOVE CALIFORNIA rated off the pace toward the inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, took the lead in the
upper stretch, drew clear toward mid-stretch then drew off with steady encouragement. EL MILAGRA saved ground on the first turn, eased out into the
backstretch and started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced in range of the lead three wide on the far turn and came along for second later
yards. DECREED veered out leaving the gate then closed to even terms and took the lead past the five eighths pole, came under pressure past the five
sixteenths, rounded the far turn near the rail but was caught in the upper stretch and weakened. PLAY CHARADES settled back in the three and four paths
the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, was forced wider into the stretch and passed
some rivals. GOLDEN GLOW settled off the rail on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. SUPERSTASIA was hustled to the front
to show the way through the front stretch, gave up the lead and gave chase leaving the five eighths pole, dropped back on the first turn, continued the chase
into the backstretch then faded past the three eighths pole. OUR ELECTRA GUITAR showed little response. RHYTHM AND POWER veered out at the
break, rounded the first turn about the four path and never factored.

the quarter pole, rounded the turn at the rail and was steadily handled to hold on well. FEDERALE gave chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail then
dueled clear for second later yards. WIZARD OF ODDS gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn then yielded in the stretch duel for second. BUCKED
TOOTH raced well off the early pace, gave chase toward the three eighths pole and rounded the turn in the four and five paths, left the turn widest and
passed some rivals. SHACKLED exchanged contact with Cash For The Soul leaving the gate then made contact with Surfer Boy George on the chute, gave
chase through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn and finished evenly. INTERESTING LEGACY gave chase, rounded the turn about the four
path and showed little more. CASH FOR THE SOUL exchanged contact with Shackled leaving the gate, gave chase then flattened in the three path of the
turn. SURFER BOY GEORGE was bumped then jostled at the break, dropped well back from contention, saved ground on the turn and could only close the

Footnotes
RRACE DAY WARRIOR rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the second turn, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in
determinedly to inch clear of RATIFY the final sixteenth. The latter stalked off the rail then challenged into the backstretch, contested at a close
disadvantage two deep on the far turn and grudgingly ceded in a good stretch try. IRISH MEADOW settled back off the rail, bid into the backstretch, raced
off the rail on the far turn and was gaining late on the runner-up. MARTIN MAN raced off the pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths
pole then flattened at the rail on the far turn. HAPPY CHARLIE saved ground, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then weakened into the far
turn. DISTORTED SPLENDOR rounded the opening turn in the four path, faded through the second turn and showed little further.

Footnotes
STROLLING THROUGH took the lead leaving the chute and rated a clear pace, came under pressure past the five sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on
the turn and was kept alert through the stretch. REAL APPEAL gave chase inside, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. TUESDAY
TOO was squeezed at the break, gave chase leaving the chute, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened the final furlong. GLOBAL EMPRESS became
edgy in the gate then gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail and flattened in the lane. OFFICER SLEW chased, rounded the turn in the three and four
paths, drifted wider into the stretch and showed little more. WAGER WORTHY became edgy in the gate then broke inward to make sharp contact with
Tuesday Too, gave chase outside, rounded the turn in the six path and had little left. IN THE NEWS became fractious in the gate, gave chase and saved
ground on the turn. MEDAL GENIUS broke out to make contact with Tuesday Too and was bumped a stride later by COOK THE BOOKS, then never
factored. The latter came out to make contact with Medal Genius on the chute then never factored. NINETY PROOF became edgy in the gate and raced
well back.
