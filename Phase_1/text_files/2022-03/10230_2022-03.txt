Footnotes
QUICK ENTRY closed to contention through the front stretch then stalked three wide the first turn, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the
lead two deep approaching the quarter and was steadily encouraged to hold on. FRANKEE MERCH saved early ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole
and raced near the rail on the far turn, eased slightly outward leaving the turn, dug in to take second mid-stretch and was gaining on the waning winner.
SUNMAN raced well back off the rail the first turn, eased outward leaving the turn and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in
the five path, finished well to take third late yards and was gaining on the top two. FAST LOADED settled off the rail the first turn, started a bid leaving the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and ran evenly through the lane. ELEVATED FOREVER stalked the early pace two deep, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn then weakened. GETOFFMYBACK settled back in the three and four paths the
first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then flattened off the rail on the far turn. MINE TO HOLD was not a factor. SCOTTSDALE took
the lead at the rail into the first turn and rated a short lead, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught approaching the quarter,
rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened.

AUBURN MILL tapered in and took a slim lead past the three quarter pole then moved to the rail into the first turn and rated the pace, opened up at the rail
on the far turn and was kept alert through the lane. BRIAN'S AVENUE rounded the first turn in the three path then stalked into the backstretch, picked up
the chase toward the three eighths pole but had to settle for second best. LATE BREAKING NEWS saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven
sxiteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn but showed little in the lane. CARTER'S RUN settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase
nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, left the turn outside and passed rivals. PECULIAR SENSATION saved ground on
the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. SILVER CASTLE was shut off and clipped the heels of Dr. Devera's Way past the three
quarter pole then raced wide on the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened in the five path of the far turn. RESIDENT stalked
off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced close into the far turn but faded at the rail through the turn. SURFER BOY
GEORGE was not a factor. DR. DEVERA'S WAY was forced in and had his heels clipped past the three quarter pole, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole but was eased with a fatal injury and had to be euthanized on the track. The Stewards reviewed the heel clipping incident before posting this race
official.

Footnotes
COUNT THE SHELLS steadied in tight at the rail into the first turn then stalked, bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the nod past the five sixteenths,
contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and held well with steady encouragement. CHARLIE POTATOES rounded the
first turn in the four path then settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, drew close four wide toward the head
of the lane and dueled through the stretch for second. BUZZHOUND was hustled to the lead while tapering inward and set the early pace, was caught into
the backstretch and gave chase between horses from that point, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn then outfinished in the
stretch duel for second. LOOKIN' SMART rounded the first turn in the five path, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn off
the rail, angled to the five path entering the stretch and finished well while gaining on third. GOOFY BOY saved early ground, picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, eased out into the stretch and finished well outside. SUSPIROS saved ground, picked up the
chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened. TRUTH SERUM settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail, eased outward into the stretch then flattened the final sixteenth. DAY OF HONOR
was never a factor. SPIRIT WOLF stalked the pace three wide on the first turn and took a slim lead into the backstretch, came under pressure nearing the
three eighths pole and was caught past the pole, continued close on the far turn then gave way.
