Footnotes
JEANETTEO set the early pace while clear on the inside, turned back the bid from J M R GEMMA leaving the quarter pole and drew off in the stretch after a
couple right handed pops with the riding crop leaving the furlong marker. J M R GEMMA was well placed early on the inside, then eased off the inside and
made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole but flattened out, clearly second best. KEEN ON ME was reserved early on the inside, swung out four wide
leaving the turn and was up for the show award late. PURELY SILVER stalked the pace three wide and weakened, lost the show award late. SHASHKA
chased the pace three wide and stopped.

SACRED MOUNTAIN set the pace on the inside and was well handled, drew off leaving the turn and was kept to mild pressure to prove much the best.
POCOPSON STATION was well placed early on the inside, made a two wide bid on the turn but proved to be no match for the winner while saving the
place. CATTLE DRIVE was settled early three wide, then was four wide on the turn, came five wide into the drive and was along for the show award to best
the rest. PEPE TONO was settled early on the inside, eased out on the turn and was four wide by the quarter pole but had no rally. ALWAYS FORGIVEN
was off a step slow, failed to menace. SOLAR WARMING stalked the pace three wide and tired.

JOJOMAR set the pace while racing off the rail, turned back a bid by the quarter pole and shook clear leaving the turn, then was kept to pressure to remain
clear to prove best. CHARGING LION tracked the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole but flattened out, held place award.
NORTHERN THUNDER chased the pace and advanced on the inside on the turn but needed more in the lane on the inside. MR HOOVER was allowed to
settle early and was four wide by the quarter pole but had no kick in the drive. NARMER was reserved early, advanced three wide on the turn, split rivals by
the quarter pole, then was blocked by the furlong marker and lacked room to the wire. SOUL FIGHT failed to menace. PETULANT DELIGHT stalked the
early pace three to four wide and was eased on the far turn, walked off. This race was HAND TIMED.

sixteenth pole and drew clear under a drive. TIP TOP TAPPER stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the backstretch to press the pace then
shook clear on the turn, then was headed around the sixteenth pole and could not match strides with that rival late, second best. NORTHERN CROSS was
settled early and was three wide on the turn but lacked the needed stretch bid, bested rest. NABRUZZI passed the tiring rivals. SOCIAL EXCLUSION
