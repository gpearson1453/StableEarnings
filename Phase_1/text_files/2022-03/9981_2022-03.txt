Footnotes
STERN was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced along the inside throughout and finished well to edge clear late under steady pressure. HERE
AND VOW was allowed to settle early on, moved up four wide through the lane and got up for the place position late. BACK INTHAT ACTION pressed the
early pace while racing between rivals and kept on to the wire. POLLY WAR CRY stalked the pace, raced three to four wide and had no final winning bid.
CYBER SNEAKER was allowed to settle early, saved ground and had no response. AQUATICA dropped back early, raced three wide and had no response.
FEAR THE FLASH was slow early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. GET UP WENDY went to his nose at the break and raced
far back.

BOURN tracked the leader from the inside, moved up four wide near the eighth pole and finished well to edge clear under strong pressure. D'WILD MUFFIN

stretch and had not enough for the top pair. PRINCESS SHAKIRA was forwardly placed to lay up close early on and weakened in the drive. FIVE ROSES
LUNA was unhurried early, raced three wide and had no late rally. DISTINCT APPROVAL raced two to three wide and had no late response. J'S TWOSTEP
BEAUTY raced four wide in the lane and never was a factor. INDAWIN saved ground and never threatened. LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS was off a step slow
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
UPPERCLASSMAN showed good early speed to set the early pace and raced well clear in the stretch run under steady handling. MATRICULATE stalked
the pace from the inside and finished second best. HOLIDAY MAN was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced between rivals and had not enough
in the drive for the top pair. GOOSE raced four wide near the eighth pole and had no final winning bid. TACKSON was allowed to settle early, raced along
the inside near the three sixteenths pole and had no rally. WINGS UP raced three to four wide in the stretch run and had no response. LITTLE JOHN was
slow early, raced five through the upper stretch and never threatened. DRASTIC raced four wide near the eighth pole and never threatened. KING OF
ANYTHING was forced to take up early, raced near the inside and never threatened. CAROUSE trailed throughout.
