Footnotes
SOUL PRODIGY away well and pressed the pace early, decided to take off the pace and went to rail entering the turn, waited for room late in the turn and
decided to sneak through up the rail entering the stretch, proved to be the winning move as SOUL PRODIGY responded strong to urging to kick clear.
AUTISM ABILITY away well and vied for lead three wide on the backstretch, entered turn dueling two wide, continued on the turn two wide and into the
stretch in the three path, battled gamely to the wire to be second best to ground saving rival. ABOVE THE LAW away well and hustled to gain the lead and
rail on the backstretch, continued to lead on the turn and into the stretch, overtaken in upper stretch and finally gave way inside the final sixteenth. MOOGIE
CAT stalked pace along the inside throughout and made up a good amount of ground in the stretch under a hand ride. MARKSMAN ON TARGET away well
and asked to show speed, encountered trouble exiting the chute when put in tight and appeared to bump with inside rival, rider steadied out of position and
lost all chance, recovered to save ground the rest of the way and bested rest. RUN MANNY RUN off slow and bumped by rival at the start, settled well off
the pace in between rivals on the backstretch, continued in between on the turn and came up empty in the lane. NO MALICE bumped rival at the start, failed
to show and speed and settled for a three wide position at the rear of the field, continued three wide throughout and never threatened to improve. INNATE
broke out and bumped rival at the start, settled off the pace in the two path, continued off the rail on the turn, drifted out into the five path entering the stretch
and tired.

Footnotes
LUCKY MARY away very well and sped off to easily clear the field, continued well clear on the turn, entered stretch well clear, drifted out while keeping full
momentum in the land and ridden out to the wire in convincing win. GODDESS APHRODITE stalked clear leader along the inside on the backstretch,
continued to save ground on the turn, launched bid along the rail and failed to make any headway while holding place. MY BELLA CHICK saved ground
throughout, eased out into the two path entering the stretch, kept on well under urging to gain on the top two. PROJECT LOGIC came out two path and
bumped rival at the start, stalked clear leader in between rivals on the backstretch, continued on the two path on the turn and weakened into the stretch.
FOR MY BROTHER bumped and pushed out at the start, settled into a three wide stalking position on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and
had nothing left to give in the lane. SURPRISE PARTY turned head while gate was opening and came away very slow, after losing all chance at the start,
rider just coasted along to the finish.

Footnotes
IMM BORN TO FLY away well, leveled quickly, drifted in a path, quickly corrected by rider and responded to hold on for the win, galloped out well.
CORONA ROSE came out two paths at the start, showed good acceleration and finished ok while lugging the last hundred yards. CHESTER CARLSON off
half length slow, showed good albeit brief acceleration before lugging out and being a handful for ayala, never fully leveled. NOMAD TOO away well, slightly
not leveled early, in contention, getting outkicked when rivals took his path, and finished evenly. VGK CORONA CARTEL fractious and reared in the gate,
came away ok and in contention, shied from rival when rival drifted out, and seemed to stop running thereafter. FELONIOUS hesitated and came away a
length slow, after a few jumps, veered in sharply and almost hit the rail, after that rider took hold to the wire.
