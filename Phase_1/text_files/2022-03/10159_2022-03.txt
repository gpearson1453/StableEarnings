Footnotes
TOTAL EFFORT prompted the pace of ALITE from the outside in the two path, came under coaxing when taking command at the five-sixteenths, took the
inside route into upper stretch and went clear under a drive to prevail. INFEASIBLE coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. MY BOY COLTON
under a light hold just off the pace a bit rank facing some kick back through the early stages, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the
inside into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. WE READY chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, bid three wide into upper stretch, then flattened out in the late going. LEFT ON BOYLSTON chased along the inside under coaxing from
the seven-sixteenths, spun three then two wide for home and weakened in the stretch. LEFTY'S WAR six then five wide down the backstretch, tucked three
then two wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals, then was
reported to have bled. ALITE established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from a pair, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, got headed for command with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. QUESTION MY SANITY coaxed from
the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths and made no impact. IRIE SPICE chased just off the inside under a ride from
the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and made no impact. NAPOLEON COMPLEX just off the inside in pursuit until tucked to the rail half a mile
from home, came under coaxing midway on the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and never menaced. ANALYSIS broke out at the start,
chased five then four wide, got placed to a protective hold nearing the quarter pole and was guided nine wide into upper stretch, then was eased up before
being pulled up in the vicinity of the eighth pole and was subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
MAGNIFICENT CHROME showed speed on the inside of two foes then was eased back and rated just off the pace, saved ground behind the leading duo
early on the turn, was let out near the three-eighths then shifted three wide at the five-sixteenths, gained outside to make a bid in upper stretch, dueled
outside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. MO MISCHIEF disputed the pace on the outside, vied three then two
wide while in front on the turn, inched clear briefly at the quarter-pole, drifted out while challenged by the winner in upper stretch, battled inside that foe into
the final furlong, drifted out some more while fighting on into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the place. TEXAS BASIN settled under
some urging, came under stronger encouragement while two then three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out in the vicinity of
the furlong marker and finished willingly for the show. GREAT WORKOUT brushed with a foe while last to commence, quickly dropped well behind under
urging while traveling with high action, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved inward in the final furlong and reached
his best stride too late while up for the last spot in the superfecta. MERCHANTS OF COOL broke out then was corrected by the rider, was coaxed early then
dropped back with five furlongs to run, settled towards the inside, raced inside to the two path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved further out
around the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. CONFORMIST brushed with an opponent at the start, contested the pace down the
backstretch, vied in the two path early on the turn then moved to the rail, dropped back into the stretch and tired. DOUBLEPOUR dropped back early then
settled on the outside, was roused in the four path on the turn and came up empty.

wearying rival and was along safe for the place honors. FLOWERS FOR LISA three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four

INVEST came away in good order then was hustled, set the pace on the inside of a foe, was urged along in the two path around the turn, turned into upper
stretch on even terms with the runner-up, dueled inside that foe to the wire and prevailed under strong urging. UMBRIA bumped lightly with a foe shortly
after the start, was taken under a tight hold early then prompted the pace on the outside under restraint, vied in the three path on the turn, was asked inside
the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch on even terms with the winner, battled outside of that foe to the wire and missed while able to get the place.
STRAIGHT SKINNY bumped lightly with an opponent after the break, was well placed towards the front, chased three then four wide on the turn, pursued
the top two under a drive in the stretch and was out-kicked while able to get the show. JADE'S DREAM broke in and bumped with a foe then bumped with
another rival early, settled towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path, spun into upper stretch under a drive and gained ground while improving
position to garner the last spot in the superfecta. CUT THE CORD lost his footing at the start then bumped with a foe early, went four wide on the turn and
gained ground but failed to seriously impact. RUN FOR BOSTON had his head turned at the break and was off a bit slow, angled in at the rear with six
furlongs to run, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten while gaining late ground. FOREVER WICKED was urged along while well back on the
outside, went five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. FORTY TWO ACE bobbled a bit at the start and bumped with a foe,
moved out before leaving the chute, settled off the pace, was urged five to six wide on the turn and came up empty. KODIAK BROWN tracked the pace on
the outside, passed the five-eighths pole under urging, chased four to five wide on the turn, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch
and had nothing left.

Footnotes
TIN PAN ALLEY showed speed then was well placed just off the pace, started the turn in the two path then shifted four wide near the three-eighths, ranged
up to make a bid at the five-sixteenths, took the lead into upper stretch, fought outside the runner-up to near the sixteenth-pole then edged clear under
strong handling. EMINENCY pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, took a brief lead at the quarter-pole then lost the advantage
to the winner into upper stretch, fought on well with that foe to the sixteenth-pole then was outfinished while clear for the place. FLOWING RIVER went to
the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened but was clear for the show. MODERN MIDAS stumbled at the start and was last away, raced well off the pace, went three wide on the turn and
improved position without threatening. RIA'S ANGEL was urged along on the far outside, went six wide on the turn and lacked the needed response.
BARREL OF QUESTS brushed with a foe at the start, was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. CRAWFORD COUNTY
bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was roused while moving from the inside to the two path on the turn and failed to respond. MY GAL
VAL brushed with an opponent at the start, settled early then came under urging, saved ground on the turn and also failed to respond. LOZ bumped lightly
with a rival at the start then dropped back, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. LUCA AT THE SPA bumped with a rival at the start, was
urged along off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn and had nothing left. GOLD BULLION was well spotted
just off the pace, chased four then five wide on the turn and faded. MAYTHISBETHEONE made contact with a foe at the start, settled on the outside, was
urged three to four wide on the turn and never reached contention. A LISTER hit the inside of the gate at the start then bumped with a foe, was urged along
off the pace, went five wide on the turn, lugged out some under the crop passing the five-sixteenths and capitulated. TOUCH OF A BUZZ bumped lightly

LANFRANKOPHILE two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole advancing to take command at that station before swinging
three wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat and held safe to the finish. KINGDOM QUEEN
got bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way and got away last, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing near the
seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, closed well on the outside latching on the top one as she hit the wire. CLOSING DEALS broke in at
the start bumping KINGDOM QUEEN in tandem with ROSEMARY POTATOES, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued
three to four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. AMORE FIRE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. CLASSIC VINMAN traded a bump at the start with BEVERLY'S
CHARGE and came under hustling, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, angled four wide into upper stretch
and passed tired rivals. TRINITY TITOLI hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide down the backstretch before tucking inside
through the turn, came under increasing pressure to the outside and was placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths in response, yielded the front and took the
inside route into upper stretch, then weakened to the finish. THATS PRETTY NICE hustled from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and
then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and offered no response. ROSEMARY POTATOES
broke out at the start bumping KINGDOM QUEEN in concert with CLOSING DEALS, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four
wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, went four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BEVERLY'S CHARGE traded a bump
at the start with CLASSIC VINMAN, chased along the inside, faded into the turn and was placed to a light protective hold through the latter portion of the
turn and tipped five to six wide into upper stretch, then got eased home through to the finish well behind and walked off under her own power.
