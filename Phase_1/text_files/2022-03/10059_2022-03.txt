FLASH was unhurried early, saved ground, angled out for the drive, closed fast and was gaining late. DEPUTY KNIGHT raced in the second flight between
horses, chased the pace, lacked the needed late response and held for show. SQUALLSGHOSTMOVER showed good early speed, went four wide on the
first turn, dropped back, was never far off the pace and lacked a stretch bid. SMOKIN ARROW led around the first turn, dropped back and had no further
response. JUROR was pulled up soon after leaving the gate and was vanned off. Fraction of 2444 was removed.

Footnotes
START A RUNNIN set the pace, drew off entering the stretch for a clear lead and held safely. KING PARKER chased the pace, lacked the needed rally and
finished second best. BLUES RAPPER raced close to the pace, saved ground and offered a mild bid to earn show. JOHNNY raced close to the pace, failed
to rally and did not threaten. JEDI WARRIOR raced mid pack in an even effort and was outrun. ANGELINO was not a factor. SHOTGUN RIDER trailed early
and improved position in an even effort. CHEF was outrun. IMPERATOR had brief speed only.
