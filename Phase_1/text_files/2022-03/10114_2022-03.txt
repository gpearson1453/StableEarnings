Footnotes
CHEST CANDY stalked the pace while racing inside, was steadied on the turn, angled out, bid willingly to duel and drew off near the sixteenth pole.
THEGLORYISALLMINE set the pace, responded when challenged to duel to the sixteenth pole and yielded. RAIL HUGGER saved ground, got through
along the rail on the turn and lacked the needed late rally. HARD TO DENY showed speed to the turn and gave way. DYNAMIC RULER broke sharply,
pressed the pace, was through early and dropped back. NO SUPAH FOR YOU had brief speed only. YHA YHA was outrun. Hand timed;

Footnotes
HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY was taken back at the start, raced in the back, went eleven wide in the upper stretch, closed willingly and got up late. NOUMEA
was never far off the pace, went ten wide in the upper stretch and closed to get up for place. JUST GRACE raced close to the pace, went nine wide in the
upper stretch, closed steadily and earned show in a game effort. STARLIGHT TWIST was unhurried early, closed inside to assume command and was
outfinished in good effort. CALLMEJESSIEJAMES stalked the pace, assumed command on the turn, came out in the upper stretch and faded. A DIME FOR
ME broke awkwardly, went eight wide in the upper stretch and lacked the needed late response. WILLING TO BURN was outrun. IKNOWYOURFACE set
the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. PERFECT EDITION was outrun. KEEPINMYPROMISE pulled up and walked off. The stewards' posted a
general inquiry. No change was made.
