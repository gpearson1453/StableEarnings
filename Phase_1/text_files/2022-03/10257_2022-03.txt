Footnotes
I'VE GOT IT tracked the early pace, ranged up seven wide through the turn, took control at the eighth pole and edged clear. FEISTYFILAMINA set a
pressured early pace, raced between rivals into the turn, was no match and finished second best. MISS LORDOSIS was allowed to settle early, raced off
the rail, drifted out through the turn, angled in and finished evenly late. QUESTA was void of any early speed, raced six wide into the turn and offered a mild
late rally. GRACEANNE was reserved early, raced five wide into the turn and flattened out. BELLA Y SOFIA was outrun early from between rivals and never
fired. RAP A GIFT pressed the early pace from off the rail and faded. DELIA was unhurried early and was never a threat. SHELLY D'ORO was taken back
and was no factor. MADDIE POPPE raced in mid pack early from between rivals and tired.
