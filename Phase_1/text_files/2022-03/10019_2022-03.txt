EMMA AND I prompted the pace two wide, took the lead between foes nearing the quarter pole, vied through the lane and dug in inside to prevail. CACTUS
KITTEN settled off the pace inside, edged closer three wide around the far turn, rallied between foes, reached near even terms in deep stretch but was held
at bay. ADELE KAT raced off the early pace three wide, circled five wide around the far turn, bid in upper stretch, dueled outside of foes in the lane and was
outfinished. BLUES SONGS settled off the pace two wide, advanced four wide between foes around the far turn, was in a bit tight in midstretch, shifted
further out and lacked the needed rally. BONHEUR was in range inside, went two wide around the far turn, steadied near the quarter pole and lacked a
closing bid. BELLE'S KINGDOM was pulling while racing three wide around the first turn, bid three deep around the far turn, turned for home on even terms
with the winner and weakened. KAY'S PROJECT set the pace along the rail, was collared nearing the quarter pole, steadied near the quarter pole and
faded through the lane.

ILLOGICAL LOVE sped to the lead soon after the start and showed the way through early stages, held clear around the turn then roused for more in the
upper stretch, felt the threat from oncoming WILDCAT STAR in the final furlong, dug in gamely under left-handed pressure and held on. WILDCAT STAR
was prompted to a forward placing out of the gate and tracked the leader around the turn, launched an outside bid approaching the head of the lane, dug in
determinedly in pursuit of ILLOGICAL LOVE, was inching up on rival in final strides but could not get by in time. DOMORE was hustled up out of the gate
but lacked early kick and raced near the back, angled inside and moved up closer late on the turn, sustained a two wide bid into the lane and secured a
share. OLYMPIC FENCER raced in contention off the top pair positioned outside a rival in early stages, ran on three wide in the upper stretch then chased
evenly in the final furlong. METAXA GRANDE raced near midpack and two wide in the early going, shifted out wider for the drive and lacked the needed
response for impact. MASKED HEROINE angled inside soon after the start, chased along the rail through the turn, cut the corner into the upper stretch,
sustained bid to the furlong marker then gave way. GRAND DIANA raced four paths wide off the early pace, chased two wide around the turn and lacked a
needed rally. LITTLE BELITA was edgy loading the gate, raced in the back, shifted to the outside in the upper stretch and failed to respond. TOUCH OF
LOVE was ridden along three wide in early stages and failed to move into close contention.

Footnotes
EVERTHREE advanced three wide after a half-mile to poke a head in front of RUBYSA, battled outside that one through the stretch and edged away
staying on her left lead. SIREN'S LUCKY SONG raced in range around the turn two to three wide, ran on willingly outside through the lane and was up for
the place. RUBYSA vied early outside T. WALTZ, got the best of that dispute only to be hooked by EVERTHREE near the five-sixteenths, fought on through
the furlong grounds and gave way inside. ELLIEREESEASTON hesitated at the break spotting three lengths or so, trailed near the two-path to the stretch,
moved out past the eighth-pole and had some late interest to get a share. TONIGHT MAYBE gained mildly two wide into the stretch, stayed on her left lead
and flattened out. T. WALTZ delayed the start fractious behind the gate, eventually came away in good order and dueled inside RUBYSA, and was finished
before going a half-mile. BAHAMIAN BEAUTY was finished early three wide.

Footnotes
MALRAUX held a slim lead in opening stages then vied outside ALLEGEDLY PERFECT around the turn, held a slim lead with a furlong left to run, tapped
along right handed, responded, turned back bids and edged away. STAR WEAVER raced in the back two wide then chased inside around the turn, came
out two to three wide at the head of the lane, shifted back to the rail and got up late to take place. ALLEGEDLY PERFECT prompted the pace in opening
stages then dueled inside of MALRAUX around the turn, continued in striking distance a furlong out then yielded in late stages and got edged for place. SKY
MAGICIAN was away in good order and forwardly placed, raced three wide in aim late on the turn, sustained three wide into the lane then chased evenly in
the final sixteenth. NO NAY MAYBE (IRE) tracked the top trio along the inside, was ridden along four wide into the lane, continued in range but failed to kick
on. GRAN MALBEC was hard ridden out of the gate but got outpaced for the early lead, hustled along three wide around the turn, came out wider for the
drive and never threatened. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
GOOCH GO BRAGH was never far back while three wide, went after FOREVER SOUPER turning for home, forged to the front from outside entering the
final furlong and drew off under pressure. BELOVED WARRIOR was reserved early near the three-path, advanced after six furlongs, rallied outside through
the late stages and was up for the place. FOREVER SOUPER set the pace inside to midstretch, was no match for the winner into the last eighth of a mile,
and lost second near the wire. CARNIVORE settled in the middle of the field inside, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and made no
appreciable headway. TRAVEL GUIDE raced well back for six furlongs, and passed only tired horses. T VILLE bumped with ARGYLL at the start, and was
outrun inside. FIERY HEART prompted the pace outside for six furlongs, and faded steadily. ARGYLL bumped with T VILLE at the start, showed speed for a
half-mile, and had nothing left approaching the stretch. TRAVELINGBLUESMAN raced three wide and was through early. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED,
FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
HERE COMES BULLET pressed the pace two wide, took over near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. TONE FEELIN set the pace along
the rail, yielded near the sixteenth pole and stayed on for the place. PLATO was bumped at the start, advanced between foes down the backstretch, raced
in range inside around the turn, could not gain on the top two in the lane but outfinished a foe for the show. MALIBU MAX broke in a tangle and bumped
PLATO at the start, had speed three wide, chased three wide around the turn and lacked the needed rally. ITALIAN CHARM lacked speed, saved ground off
the pace, steadied near the quarter pole and never threatened. CATCHING FISH chased the pace inside and faded after a half. KEEPSAKEKITTEN was
outrun inside and was vanned off. DIZZY GILLESPIE played no factor while racing two wide. LUCAS N' LORI had brief speed four wide. PAPA HONOR
was off slow, made some progress three wide around the turn, came up empty in the lane and was easing through the later stages.

Footnotes
BENELUX was a bit slow into stride out the gate and allowed to settle heading into the first turn, remained rated off the pace under slight restraint, let out a
notch four wide into the final turn and quickly circled up to loom a threat, dueled with UNCLE CURCLE in the stretch run, dug in along the outside,
exchanged bumps and prevailed in closing strides. UNCLE CURLY was well placed racing two to three wide in range up the backstretch, advanced to duel
three deep at the quarter pole, shook free to a slim lead in the upper stretch then dueled inside of BENELUX, fought back from the inside, exchanged
bumps and got edged out in final strides. VETTORI KIN (BRZ) was unhurried and raced near the back, picked up the pace entering the far turn, launched a
four wide bid in the upper stretch and produced a solid finish. MR MATUSCHEK settled through early stages, remained patiently handled around the far
turn, given cue five wide a furlong out and had a mild improve. HEZA KITTEN rated two to three wide near midpack, launched a bid for top trio mid-way
around the far turn, kept under a drive three wide into the stretch run and ran on evenly. POPPY'S BOYS rated inside near midpack, given cue three wide
with a furlong left to run and lacked a needed rally. ON THE COUCH was reserved in the back, hustled up four wide with three furlongs left to run, showed
some interest then came out wider for the drive and failed to move on. SPINNING KITTEN raced off the pace, saved ground into the upper stretch, tipped
two to three wide under a drive and never threatened. BORU set a pressured pace, dueled around the final turn then came up empty in the upper stretch.
VEGAS KITTEN was forwardly placed up the backstretch, dueled around the final turn then tired in the drive. KITTEN STREET stalked inside up the
backstretch then began to fade mid-way around the final turn. STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY LOOKING INTO THE STRETCH RUN, AFTER REVIEW

Footnotes
EAGLE CHIEF was well rated racing near mid-pack through early stages, picked up the pace along the inside into the final turn, given cue three wide bid at
the head of the lane, swept by to clear command and stayed sharp under steady urging. WARN raced off the early pace, was ridden along two wide around
the far turn, came under left-handed pressure entering the lane, shifted out five wide and finished well. SWING LOW lagged out of the gate and continued
unhurried two to three wide up the backstretch, swung six wide into the upper stretch, rallied willingly in final stages but ran out of time. SHIMMERING
LIGHT rated near midpack up the backstretch, was ridden along the rail around the final turn, tipped two wide for the drive and had a mild improve. EL
PECADO prompted the pace through early stages, dueled around the far turn, sustained bid to the furlong marker then gave way. LOVE ME ARCHIE
settled two wide around the first turn, tipped wider into the backstretch raced off the pace, hustled along along three wide into the upper stretch and lacked a
needed rally. THE ZIP FACTOR settled and saved ground through early stages, was ridden along two wide into the stretch run and failed to move on. OUT
WORK'N was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the top pair up the backstretch, failed to advance when called upon around the final turn and
steadily faded. BEAU BROWN set a pressured pace, dueled around the final turn and tired in the drive. RIGHTEOUS ROY saved ground around the first
turn and remained unhurried up the backstretch, was ridden along four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. D BLACK MAMBA steadied just
after the start, raced near the back three to four wide and failed to move into contention. MY WROTE secured inside position around the first turn, tracked
the pace up the backstretch then began to retreat around the final turn. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE
