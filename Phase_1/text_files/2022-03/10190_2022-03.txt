Footnotes
SEVEN ROONEY exchanged a light brush at the start, moved through inside to take the lead after the opening quarter, moved clear soon after racing off
the inside, went in the two to three path extending the advantage, held safe. TAB ME OUT was urged to the fore at the break, came in early up the
backstretch pursuing the new leader three to four wide through the turn, kept on in the stretch to close the gap. QUINTON'S CHARMER broke awkwardly
and veered out dramatically at the start, settled at the rear off the inside, went in the four path on the turn, swung nine wide into upper stretch, drifted in then
out in the lane and rallied. WILD FIREWATER exchanged several bumps at the start, switched outside rivals and advanced forward to track from between
foes, was forced in a bit midway up the backstretch exchanging light contact, continued two wide on the turn and lacked any late kick. CASH CRUZER
chased the leaders four to five wide on the turn, failed to rally. DYNASTY SMOKE was fractious behind the gate, had several bumps at the start, was
brushed up the backstretch and in tight being shuffled back a path, saved ground on the turn while dropping back and was not a threat. ANXIOUS INDIAN
broke inwardly bumping with rivals at the start, settled into stride outside, chased five to six wide on the turn drifting seven to eight deep into upper stretch,
faded.

Footnotes
PARK LANE LAD was forwardly-placed inside rivals heading into the turn, raced just off the rail through that bend and edging clear, drifted four wide into
upper stretch, held sway under steady handling. U S N CADEN chased outside five then four wide on the turn, altered inside the drifting leaving at the top of
the stretch and lacked the needed late kick but was second best. MAJORWAYHOME was forwardly-positioned between runners for three-sixteenths,
continued the chase two wide on the turn and ran on evenly. BLACK EYED BANDIT settled mid-pack going four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch
six wide and improved. DAN WHO settled at the rear racing off the inside, went in the four path through much of the turn, swung seven to eight wide into the
stretch and passed tired rivals. LAUGHING STORM chased inside racing in the two then three path on the turn, angled six wide into the stretch and faded.
KEY TO THE CITY pressed the pace four then three wide, came up empty. POSTMANFOURTYEIGHT failed to threaten after going two to three wide on
the turn.

Footnotes
BIKINI TIME settled into stride, advanced on the leader three wide taking the lead past the quarter pole, lugged out at the head of the stretch then drifted in
a bit in mid-stretch while clear, held sway under steady handling. ATILL I CHIME set the pace racing off the inside, went in the two path on the turn, kept on
evenly once overtaken. BAND OF GLORY settled off the leaders mid-pack, went three wide on the turn, captured show honors. REAPPEARING settled in
the back half of the field, went four wide on the turn, gained mildly late. DIXIE JEN broke very awkwardly spotting the field a couple lengths, advanced
outside four wide, lacked the needed late kick. AUTUMN TOUCH was forwardly-placed inside, steadily retreated. SUNNY JEWEL failed to threaten after
racing well back two to three wide on the turn. HOLLYWOOD PRINCESS switched out at the half-mile, went four wide on the turn, faded.

Footnotes
MISS ABILITY settled off the leaders racing mostly six to seven wide, driving and just got up to prevail. BIKINILESS was off slowly spotting the field about
three to four lengths, moved forward in behind four wide into the turn, had room five to six deep at the top of the stretch, made a strong bid for the lead in
mid-stretch but just missed. CHARITY WATER broke outwardly, was prominent early three wide, exchanged a brush in upper stretch and was outkicked.
ANNIE GET UR GUNS was forwardly-positioned five to six wide, had no extra. SHEZACONSTANTSONG exchanged a bump after the start, settled
mid-pack two to three wide, came out a bit in upper stretch and improved position. I GET STORMED contended inside rivals on or just off the rail, lacked the
needed late kick. ALWAYS PUNCTUAL steadied slightly after the start advanced between rivals early, went four wide on the turn, exchanged a minor brush
in upper stretch and weakened. MISS JAX failed to rally after moving in from six to four wide on the turn and then back out. UNDER RAPPES exchanged a
bump after the start, moved out from three to six wide on the turn, failed to make a bid. RONA CHROME chased briefly from inside, dropped back and
faded.
