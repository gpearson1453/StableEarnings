Footnotes
BILLY YANK came through tight quarters at the start to track off the second flight three wide between foes, commenced a steady advance nearing upper
stretch and continued in that path to wrest the advantage and go clear in time under firm left handed pressure. EL GUAPO broke inwards crossing the paths
of several rivals, was quickly righted, then sprinted clear racing through the backstretch, widened the advantage entering the turn, held sway past midstretch
but faltered late. POSEIDONS MYTH, caught in close quarters at the start, switched out four wide tracking off the second flight just outside the eventual
winner, continued in that path into the bend, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to close the gap while just outkicked for the
place honors. RAL COPPERHEADROAD shifted out in early stages to track behind the second between foes racing to the turn but lacked a rally. CALLE
DE BOYD switched off the inside early while being urged pursuing the pacesetter to the turn but soon gave out nearing upper stretch. PESKY VALESKI
tracked the pacesetter as part of the second flight along the inside on the backstretch but faded early.

Footnotes
DOODLE HOPPER ducked out at the start carrying out FADE AWAY momentarily, tracked off the first flight four wide through the backstretch, was
prompted to advance in that path racing through the turn to bid for command nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage in upper stretch and went clear
under firm encouragement. PREFERRED OUTCOME tracked off the first flight racing through the backstretch, advanced three deep between foes on the
turn to challenge for command racing into upper stretch, couldn't match the winner in the drive but held rivals for the place honors. FADE AWAY, carried out
at the start, recovered to race five wide just off the second flight on the backstretch, shifted inwards racing into the bend, then switched out four wide in the
closing stages while making an effort to improve position. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY, forwardly placed along the inside, saved ground through the turn
tracking just off the leaders, was prompted to advance nearing upper stretch but had no closing bid. PHILO, urged to the lead dictating the pace a bit off the
rail racing to the turn, gave way between foes into the lane. PICCADILLY BEAU settled last while angling to the inside early and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RIDE EM, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset, dueled inside a rival through the turn to upper stretch, tipped off the inside in the closing
stages and edged forward under firm encouragement. THROWN FOR A LOUPE joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue
outside the eventual winner through the turn past midstretch but proved only second best. SUPER EDGAR tracked off the first flight outside foes from well
out of striking distance racing to the turn, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch and continued with a mild gain. RIP IT RYAN, off a step slowly, tracked
the leaders between foes from well out of striking distance racing to the turn and continued evenly while edging a rival for position late.
TIMEWON'TLETMEGO, urged inside the top pair prompting the pace in the opening stages, dropped off those foes while switching off the inside racing into
the bend and steadily faded. CASTLE KING settled between foes in early stages and failed to menace. FITZ'S MO broke slowly and proved no threat.

FARMINGTON ROAD was urged inside rivals from the break disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, edged forward to a clear
margin nearing upper stretch and was kept to firm encouragement to extend the advantage to the end. WINFROMWITHIN joined the pace four wide racing
into the first turn, continued willingly three wide nearing upper stretch to prove best of the others but failed to match terms with the winner. CONFESSOR,
urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset into the far turn, faded into upper stretch. MANOR HOUSE was rated along the inside tracking just off
the leaders racing to the far turn, saved ground on the second bend while being prompted to advance but had no closing bid. MUNQAD, held up nearing the
first turn to track off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, gave way racing into the far turn. MYSTIC LINK, urged three wide between
pressing the pace in the opening half, came up empty entering the far turn.

CUPIDS DREAM broke through the gate prior to the start, was away well, then urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the
backstretch, dispatched JUDGE JUDITH racing into upper stretch to widen the advantage and held BLUE NEITH to the end under firm left handed
encouragement. The latter tracked just off the leaders between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three wide leaving the midway
point of the far turn and continued willingly in that path to close the gap on the winner to the end. TIZ NENA, bumped at the start, angled to the inside racing
to the first turn tracking the leaders in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick while going well enough to earn a share.
JUDGE JUDITH was urged prompting the pacesetter from the outset to the far turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. MALIBU SKY broke inwards
bumping TIZ NENA at the start, was collected, then settled last along the inside racing to the first turn and failed to mount a serious challenge thereafter.
RUSTON DRILL was urged in pursuit of the leaders four wide racing into the first turn and dropped out early.

NATIVE HAWK angled inwards stalking the pacesetter outside a rival through the backstretch, was prompted to advance nearing upper stretch, continued
with a steady bid while being carried to the four path in the closing stages but narrowly prevailed in time under firm left handed encouragement.
TRAPPEZOID angled inwards nearing the chute while being urged to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage just off the rail through the backstretch,
shifted out racing through the stretch grudgingly resisting the winner's bid but was collared approaching the wire. ROARING RIVER was rated off the
second flight on the backstretch while shifting off the inside, continued three, then four wide into the lane to gain some position but lacked the needed late
response. CREEKMORE angled to the inside racing to the chute tracking just off the pacesetter through the backstretch to the turn, then faded into upper
stretch. CAUSALISTIC was settled five wide between foes in early stages and failed to menace thereafter. BOURBON WISDOM was settled avoiding close
quarters at the break, switched out six wide on the backstretch and never proved a serious factor.

ENDLESS broke readily, was rated along the inside dropping off the leaders racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling approaching the far
turn, angled out five wide nearing upper stretch and responded to firm left handed encouragement to wrest the advantage in time. DANCING SOPHIA, off a
bit slowly, was urged to regain position between foes racing into the first turn, switched outside rivals racing into the backstretch, steadily advanced four
wide nearing the far turn to challenge for command in that path midway through the bend, moved away to a clear advantage nearing upper stretch, resisted
the winner's bid grudgingly to the end but just failed to contain that foe. CURRENT CAUSE, shifted inwards, then was steadied avoiding tight quarters
nearing the first turn, settled well off the leaders near the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out nearing the far turn, angled out five wide approaching
upper stretch and continued well enough to earn a share while failing to menace the top pair. SUWANNEE CHICK was settled outside a rival in the last flight
racing to the backstretch, shifted out racing into the lane and passed some tiring rivals late. MACRELLETTA tracked just off the first flight outside those foes
racing to the backstretch, was urged to advance three deep between rivals bidding for command on the far turn but came up empty in the drive. ANY PORT,
forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace in the opening half, moved to press the issue between foes entering the far turn and gave way racing into the
stretch. DONNA LIRICA, urged to the lead along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes
racing into the far turn and soon gave way. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF CURRENT CAUSE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF DANCING SOPHIA ALLEGING INTERFERENCE APPROACHING THE FIRST TURN, BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL KING angled inwards while being urged dictating the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, responded to maintain a clear margin
when challenged leaving the midway point of the turn, shook clear racing into upper stretch and was kept to steady encouragement. MYSTERY MAN, urged
to contend along the inside in the opening stages, was held up after the opening furlong, then switched outside foes continuing in pursuit of the eventual
winner three wide racing into the turn to briefly menace but quickly proved no match while besting the remaining field. NEWYEARSBLOCKPARTY was
urged inside the pacesetter prompting that rival while shifting to the inside racing through the backstretch, lost terms with the top pair nearing upper stretch
but continued well enough to prevail for a share. WELD angled to the inside in early stages dropping well off the leaders, saved ground to upper stretch and
continued evenly while being outkicked for a share. PREPARE FOR GLORY was settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the turn, found his best
stride to gather momentum between foes midstretch but steadied off a tiring foe nearing the sixteenth marker. BERHANU, carried inwards by the leaders in
the opening stages, switched off the inside to track the pacesetter between foes racing to the turn and steadily faded into the lane. ASHIHAM, reserved
along the inside in the opening stages, failed to menace thereafter. PICASSO tracked off the second flight racing off the inside on the backstretch and
dropped out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
LADY TEUFLESBERG angled to the inside racing to the first turn stalking just off the pacesetter, tipped outside that rival midway through the first turn to
attend the pace under light rating, took over nearing the midway point of the far turn, shifted out under pressure racing into the stretch but steadily drew
away under a right handed drive. CIDSTAYINURLAINE sprinted clear a bit off the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the
second bend, continued in pursuit of the winner once headed racing into upper stretch but proved no match while clearly best of the others. DOUBLE DOT
was rated off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, lost some position after a half, was prompted to split foes racing into upper stretch, then
angled in late while continuing well enough to earn a share. REYNA DE VERANO settled outside foes dropping well off the second flight to the backstretch,
angled out four wide racing into upper stretch but offered no rally. OB LA DI, urged to a forward placing outside a rival in second flight in early stages,
continued in pursuit of the tp pair into the far turn and gave way between foes racing through the stretch. GET BACK HOME tracked the leaders inside a
rival in second flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded after a half. WHISPERING WANDA broke inwards brushing IMAHONKYTONKGIRL at the
start, settled well off the field racing to the backstretch and never proved any factor. IMAHONKYTONKGIRL, brushed at the start, dropped out last racing to
the first turn and trailed well off the field throughout.
