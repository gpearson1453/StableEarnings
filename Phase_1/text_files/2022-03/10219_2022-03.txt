Footnotes
BOURBON DELIGHT took command past the wire the first time, rated through the middle half, remained clear in holding the runner up comfortably safe
down the lane under steady handling. JEDREK stalked the pace while off the inside, called on for some run into the far turn, made little inroads on the
winner while chasing that one into the stretch, minimal late gain, clearly second best. SERBIAN SAILOR unhurried for five furlongs, moved a bit closer while
three wide late in the final turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, could do little with the top two the final furlong to finish up best of the rest. REMEMBER
NORMANDY raced firmly in hand in the two path when with the main body, moved out a bit in some traffic when inside entering the far turn, came up empty
for the drive. OTHER TIMES forwardly placed along the inside and under firm restraint through the first turn, moved out a bit for the run up the backstretch
while still in hand, dropped back to the inside far turn, had little left for the stretch run in tiring. COMMANDING OFFICER dwelt, then broke out and
awkwardly, moved up to be four wide late in the first turn, continued outside, had little for the drive. HOOK 'EM JOHN off a step slow, saved ground first
turn, moved out three wide, continued to trail and showed little. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

Footnotes
INCORRUPTIBLE dueled up front along the inside, continued to alternate through the turn, disposed of the other speed in upper stretch, remained
comfortably clear the final furlong while kept to pressure. HANKS in the second flight off the inside, raced three wide through the turn, steered out to be
widest approaching the furlong grounds, rallied late to be up for the pace out in the. WINDCRACKER tracked the pace in the two path, continued to race in
the second flight turn, angled in, outkicked for the place. BLAME GEORGE raced off the pace outside into the turn, four wide midway on the bend, three
wide into the lane when moving closest to the winner, flattened out in the final furlong. APPRAISAL saved ground to no avail.. HOLDING PATTERN off a
step slow, trailed most of the way to be never a threat. MEGATAP dueled up front in the two path and outside the winner, caved in turning for home,
continued to weaken steadily in the run to the wire.

inside, came four wide out of the turn, rallied, narrowly missed the place. MANDONA dueled up front along the inside, continued to alternated into the far
turn, weakened in the drive. MOONSHINE LILY went one pace while racing outside. COURTNEY FAY alternated up front in the two path for five furlongs,

Footnotes
SHI O'SHI broke back, tracked the leader from along the inside, continued along the rail under confident handling through the turn, switched to the outside
for the drive, collared the leader a furlong out and drew clear without feeling the whips to win ridden out. UNTOUCHED ELEGANCE broke alertly, set a clear
pace early off the inside, continued to show the way through the turn, offered brief resistance to the winner in upper stretch closest to the inside then proved
no match, clearly second best. LOVELY LADY LEXI broke out but with the frontrunners, was straightened to race within striking distance while racing
outside, three wide through the turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive, just lasted for the show. WARM BEAUTY off a step slow, trailed for a half,
four wide into the lane, improved position while widest through the lane, narrowly missed the show. HOPTOWN HONEY off the pace, raced four wide
through the turn, failed to muster a rally. FABLES LOVE AFFAIR off a step slow, mid pack toward the inside, weakened the final furlong.

Footnotes
ABDAN broke alertly, set the pace in the two path, shrugged off a foe turning for home, remained clear through the lane while being kept to task. ROAD
BIBLE within striking distance off the inside, crept closer in the three path and outside the winner late in the turn, lost contact with the winner while drifting
past the furlong marker, held sway for the place. VIOLENT PASS in the second flight while racing inside, battled with the runner up the final furlong,
outkicked by that one while remaining along the rail. FUNANDFUNNY back off the pace and the inside, came four wide out of the turn, turned in a modest
rally to improved position a bit, not a threat to the top three. HARD TO PARK broke in the air, saved ground for a half, improved upper stretch then flattened
out in the late going to finish up evenly. HOLIDAY TICKET went one paced throughout while saving ground through the turn. WISE KHOZAN void of speed,
failed to rally. UNEMBELLISHED in the second flight while racing three wide, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
ALEX JOON off a step slow, raced behind the pace in the two path through the first turn, continued back in the run up the backstretch, ranged up into
contention with a three wide move late in the final turn, engaged the two leaders nearing the furlong grounds from the outside, drove steadily clear.
PRIORITIZATION pressed the leader from three down to two path first turn, continued to apply pressure the middle half, dueled upper stretch, briefly vied
between rivals and inside the winner a furlong out, failed to keep pace with that one, edged clear for the place. BIG THORN broke on top, set the pace along
the inside, dueled into the stretch while remaining closest to the inside, gradually weakened when headed by the top just over a furlong remaining,
comfortably salvaged the show. DR JACK in mid pack just off the inside, continued one paced off the rail in lacking a closing response. WHAT A COUNTRY
within striking distance while saving all the ground, failed to muster a closing response when called on for the drive. LAST MARTINI off step slow, trailed
most of the way, made little impact. ALTERED settled off the pace while racing three wide, tired.

SIMPLY BEGUILED off a step slow, raced well back for a half while saving all the ground, steered out and hit a moving seam inside the furlong grounds
when on stride, lodged a late bid while between foes, in time, lost rider pulling up. RIO LADY back off the pace while just off the inside, in traffic late turn,
steered out for the drive, challenged widest of the first flight late, outfinished in the final strides while finishing up evenly. BAJA FOG in mid pack and outside,
four out to five wide through the turn, widest through the lane, finished up willingly to be in time for the show. MILANA broke sharp, cleared toward the inside
soon after, showed the way through the turn, continued to set the pace past the furlong marker when well clear, fell apart in the late going to lose several
positions. OUTFORARUN bumped repeatedly at the start with BORN INTO BAD NEWS, recovered to race toward the front and the inside, second flight
past the furlong marker, came up empty in the late going to finish flatly. FASHIONABLY QUICK off the pace and the inside, four wide and surrounded by
rivals turning for home, lacked a closing response. PLANETARY off a step slow, main body toward the inside, two path into the lane, also was found lacking
when the real running began at the head of the stretch. UNDECODED forwardly placed for a half three wide, backed up through the stretch. BORN INTO
BAD NEWS bumped repeatedly with OUTFORARUN to be slow away, trailed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. CYCOLOGIST in mid
pack and four wide, continued in the four path turn, tired through the stretch. G MONEY LIV chased the leader for a half, stopped in the drive and trailed
home.

Footnotes
PARLANCE with the pace four wide in the run up the backstretch while between foes, remained between rivals through the bend, held a narrow advantage
in the three wide entering the stretch, drew steadily clear while kept to pressure. STANLEY MARKET broke in a bit to slightly bother a couple of inner rivals,
set or forced the pace along the inside, could not match the winner through the stretch, remained determined and clear for the second spot late. COM' ON
SWEET LUV bothered and was off slowly, raced back, angled out four wide turning for home, staged a mild rally while remaining well wide to be along late
for the show. ICY STARE DOWN prompted the pace while in the five path up the backstretch, continued to prompt the leaders four wide exiting the bend,
went evenly through the stretch in lacking a late punch. BENEDICT CANYON with the pace for a half in the three path and between horses, faltered in the
drive. PIPELINE GIRL with the first flight between rivals for three furlongs, was finished midway on the turn. IMPULSUS bothered at the start to be off
slowly, was never a factor while saving ground.

FORSAKEN off slow, moved up to a forward position under a snug hold up the backstretch, mired in traffic through most of the turn, steered out slightly to
be three wide by upper stretch, late bid, edged clear under steady handling. ALLO ENRY forwardly placed while three wide, lost some position late in the
turn, briskly roused with a right handed crop upper stretch while rider was leaning in, finished willingly to be in time for the place. J'S LITTLE MAN within
striking distance while outside, closer four wide through the turn, took over nearing the furlong grounds, led, could not contain the top two. KILGORE
pressed the issue early off the inside, narrowly showed the way late in the turn while between rivals, continued to vie past the furlong marker, had little left
for the late going. WARNING LABEL behind the pace while racing toward the inside, waited in traffic late in the turn, went evenly in the late going.
MALINTENT off a step slow, raced back in trailing, improved through traffic down the lane without posing a serious threat. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY void of
speed, angled out to be five wide turning for home, passed tiring foes to improve a bit, also not a serious threat. BOSTON WALLY remained back while
racing four wide through the turn. HEART HEADED ARKY with the pace four almost four furlongs along the inside, stopped through the stretch. UNCLE O.
G. off slow, moved up to race in mid pack early, also stopped and finished far back.
