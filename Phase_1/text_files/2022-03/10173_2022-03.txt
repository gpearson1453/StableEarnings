Footnotes
SHES'A PERFECTLADY stalked the pace off the rail then between rivals, lacked room and had to pause briefly at the three-eighths pole, chased near the
inside into the lane, then tipped out and rallied three deep to get up. LUNATIC was closest in pursuit outside the pacesetter, bid two wide at the quarter pole,
took over in upper stretch, put away inner rival with a sixteenth remaining but was run down by the winner in the end. TRANSLATE brushed the gate and
came away a bit slow, trailed the field up the backstretch, went two wide around the bend, then angled widest in the stretch and closed well for a game third.
SUITE MADAM BLUE sped to the front and set the pace up the backstretch, tested by rival with a quarter mile left to run, lost command in upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. BOWL OF CHERRIES chased three deep to the turn, moved to the two path around the bend, steered out in the stretch, put in
tight quarters at the sixteenth pole and flattened. UNWRITTEN CODE jumped the dirt crossing and stumbled early, chased inside to the turn, got put in a bit
tight midway around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
AMERICAN ADMIRAL rated along the inside then in the two path behind the top pair, tipped three then four wide on the far turn and bid three deep entering
the stretch, took over and cleared approaching the eighth pole and drew away. BALLADEER pressed the pace from outside, lost contact for a bit before
applying pressure again on the backstretch, dueled two then three wide past the five-sixteenths pole, led briefly in upper stretch but was soon overtaken by
the winner and ran on to prove second best. HAPPY RUNNER set the pace under pressure early, cleared for a bit on the backstretch before being
pressured again by BALLADEER, dueled with that rival past the five-sixteenths pole, lost the lead in upper stretch and flattened along the fence. CANDY
FOR CARMEL was off slow to begin, chased three wide early, moved out four wide on the far turn then steered down to the two path leaving that bend and
had little left for the drive. HALFBARBERBINGIE lacked early quickness and steered down to the two path, went between runners at the seven-sixteenths
pole, angled to the rail around the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
TIZZY TWISTER came away a step slow, went up to grab the early lead with company to the outside, dueled with SWEET CALIFORNIA around the turn
and into the stretch, kicked clear nearing the eighth pole and drew away. WARREN'S QUEEN BEE well placed behind the top pair in the early going,
entered the turn along the rail, eased out to the three path around the bend, finished willingly for the place but could not reach the winner. ROMAN
EMPRESS bumped from inside at the start, traveled in range early outside rivals, chased four wide into the lane and was along for the show. SWEET
CALIFORNIA broke a step slow then went up prompt the pace from outside, dueled around the turn and into the stretch, lost contact outside the eighth pole
and weakened in the late stages. MIX AND MATCH bobbled and bumped rival at the start, chased off the rail then two wide into the turn, angled to the rail
around the bend and weakened. ADMIRAL AESCHBACH stumbled leaving the gate, shifted in shortly after, traveled along the inside then angled four wide
and came up empty. SWEET DUCK tracked widest up the backstretch, round the turn four wide while dropping back and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
FUNNY FELINE sped clear to establish the front, padded the lead around the turn, remained well clear into the final furlong and was kept to task through the
final sixteenth. ROUBAIX was off alertly while breaking out, chased just out of range up the backstretch, went two wide around the turn and finished willingly
to best the rest. BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE settled off the pace, went four deep into the turn, chased three deep into the stretch and held the show. CURRENT
MOOD raced along the inside off the pace, lacked room from the seven-sixteenths pole to the five-sixteenths pole, angled out in the stretch, was rank and
ducked in at the sixteenth pole and kept on to round out the superfecta. MENSA ON TAP was off slow to begin and got pinched at the start, chased
between rivals off the pace, lacked room from the half-mile pole to the five-sixteenths pole, angled to the inside around the bend, got forced in by CURRENT
MOOD at the sixteenth pole and was outfinished for the minor award. ROSIE FORECAST was off slow leaving the gate, angled to the inside, lacked room
and was forced to steady behind rival early, traveled along the inside then tipped out into the stretch and could not rally. KITTEN'S KID forwardly placed in
the early going outside a rival, angled to the rail around the turn and weakened. SUMMER PUDDING was close early then dropped back up the backstretch,
went three deep into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. YES YOUR GRAZE broke well, chased three deep off the pace, got shuffled
into the turn, came three wide into the lane and also weakened. BELLEO'S MUSIC settled off the pace well off the rail, went four then five wide around the
turn and made no impact. SUGAR APPLE broke slow and checked soon after the start, chased two wide around the turn and made no impact. SHEILA'S
CHARLIE was off slow and broke in, sent to a forward position on the inside, dropped back around the turn and tired.

Footnotes
AFFABLE pressed the pace from outside, challenged around the turn, dueled into the lane and put in a head in front past the eighth pole, then drew clear in
deep stretch. DISCO BALL shifted out and bumped rival in the beginning, sped to the front and set the pace with AFFABLE alongside, dueled with that rival
on the far turn and down the stretch, relinquished the lead past the eighth pole and was able to save the place. PHANTOM DANCE stalked the pace along
the inside, tipped two wide on the far turn, put in a mild late bid and missed the place. DIVINE ARMOR bumped both sides at the start, settled off the rail,
angled six wide leaving the far turn and kept on for a minor award. ZIMBA WARRIOR trailed two wide on both turns and improved position in the lane.
MONGOLIAN WIND pulled a bit entering the first turn, traveled in range in the early going off the rail, chased between foes on the second turn, angled four
wide into the stretch, lost his path midstretch and angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and failed to threaten. HOLDEN THE LUTE got bumped at the start,
stalked the top pair from outside, bid three deep on the far turn and weakened in the lane. NOBLE REFLECTION stumbled badly leaving the gate, angled
four wide around the first turn, traveled three deep on the second bend then came five wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
LOUD MOUTH vied for the lead from inside, inched ahead into the far turn, cleared entering the lane and drew off under right-handed urging and steady
handling. THERE GOES HARVARD rated in the early stages in the two path, tipped three to four wide leaving the second turn, proved no match for the
winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. PARNELLI vied for the lead between rivals, continued to apply pressure on the far turn, lost contact
into the lane and weakened to third. BACK RING LUCK pulled at the three-quarter pole and into the backstretch, angled out and came five wide into the
lane, had the rider lose the whip in upper stretch and summoned a mild response and rounded out the superfecta. MOTOWN MUSIC went four wide into the
first turn then angled down to the two path, remained two wide to the stretch and failed to make an impact. GOING WITH STYLE went three then two wide
on the first turn between rivals, angled to the inside and saved ground to the stretch and lacked the needed response. COVER ME UP vied four deep into
the first turn, contested the pace three deep up the backstretch, could not keep pace with the top pair around the far turn and weakened. PRINCE MAIOR
vied three deep into the first turn, chased outside a rival on the backstretch, went two then three wide on the second bend and weakened. DANCE SOME
MO broke out, steadied behind rival five wide into the first turn, angled down to the three path around the bend, dropped back to last entering the second
bend, eased into and down the stretch, coasted across the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
EDDIE'S NEW DREAM broke well then settled in a stalking position, entered the turn between rivals, bid outside the leader late on the turn, kept the
pressure on BECCA TAYLOR through the lane, surged in the final strides and got up on the line. BECCA TAYLOR bumped lightly with PULPIT rider at the
start, sped to the front then cleared and angled to the inside, met bids from a pair of rivals late on the turn, maintained a short lead through the lane and into
deep stretch but got nailed at the wire. SENSIBLE CAT settled early outside a rival, went three wide into the turn, exited the bend five wide and gained the
show. SHE'S DEVOTED stalked outside a pair of rivals into the turn, bid three deep late on the bend, entered the stretch four to five wide and faltered in the
final furlong. SASSYSERB tracked off the pace and steered to the two path for the turn, moved out and exited the bend four wide and could not summon the
needed rally. PULPIT RIDER was off slow and bumped leaving the gate, saved ground through the bend, moved off the rail in the drive and went between
rivals late but never failed to threaten. MAYBE I WILL forwardly placed in the early going on the inside, chased two wide into the lane and flattened.

rivals into the first turn, ceded command around the bend and stalked from outside, bid three deep on the far turn, cleared in upper stretch and but got run
down by a trio of rivals late. FLY THE SKY reserved in the early going, coaxed three then four wide on the far turn and showed late effort. EXULTATION
