Footnotes
EDGEWAY prompted the pace from outside, challenged around the bend, kicked clear at the quarter pole and drew off easily under light hand urging.
PRIVATE MISSION set the pace with EDGEWAY to the outside, dueled around the turn then lost contact with the leader at the quarter pole, tipped to the
outside leaving the bend, flattened in the final furlong but was still clearly second best. DYNASTY OF HER OWN broke well then dropped back chasing the
top pair, navigated the turn four then three wide and could not rally. ALOHA KITTEN stumbled badly leaving the gate, lagged behind up the backstretch,
angled in on the turn and never got involved.

TOO LATE at the top of the stretch, cleared that rival at the eighth pole, drifted out in the final furlong and held well. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY broke slow,
climbed early on the backstretch, advanced four wide around the turn, rallied through the lane but was not enough. TOO LATE broke well then drifted out

flattened to third. FORT BRIDGER chased the speed from off the rail, went two wide around the turn while losing positions and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
KING APOLLO raced up close early then moved back a bit to a stalking position and steered to the inside, moved a bit off the rail around the turn, tipped out
and bid three deep in midstretch and overhauled TOWN BOY in the final sixteenth. TOWN BOY pressed the pace from outside to the stretch, put a head in
front at the eighth pole but got outkicked by KING APOLLO in the final sixteenth. CLAMPETT forwardly placed outside the top pair, continued three deep
around the bend, bid four deep in the stretch, lacked the needed late kick but bested STREET ART for the show. STREET ART set the pace on the inside,
held a short lead through the turn and into the lane, lost command at the eighth pole and got edged for the show. ARRABIATA broke slow and was crowded
a bit leaving the gate, raced off the pace outside a rival, went two to three wide around the turn, steered out in upper stretch and could not rally. MAKE MINE
WINE was off slow and came in at the start, sat off the pace on the inside, entered the lane two wide and proved no menace. DIVINE FEMININE was off a
bit slow from outside and dropped back early, angled to the rail on the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
TAYET stalked two then three wide on the first turn, bid two wide into the second bend, dueled down the stretch, took over at the sixteenth pole and edged
away to prove best. WITH THIS VOW cleared early and angled to the inside around the clubhouse turn, controlled the pace up the backstretch, challenged
into the far turn, held a short lead into the lane, dueled down the stretch and yielded grudgingly. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH trailed two wide around the first
turn, angled to the rail on the second bend, summoned a mild late bid and whittle the gap on the top pair. STOIC LUNA steadied off the heels of WITH THIS
VOW on the first turn, steered out on the backstretch, chased three wide while losing ground on the second bend and flattened. WILD ARCH broke step
slow, got shuffled between rivals on the first turn, moved out on the first turn, eased early on the backstretch, pulled up at the half-mile pole and walked off.

Footnotes
THRIVE sent for the lead, cleared and angled in around the first turn, padded the lead on the backstretch, remained comfortably ahead into the stretch, then
widened under hand urging and coasted in late. WHISKEY VISION was off alertly then dropped back and chased four wide around the first turn, traveled
three deep on the second bend, came four wide into the stretch and bested the rest. KING ROB forwardly placed four then three wide on the clubhouse
turn, closest in pursuit up the backstretch, gained some ground around the far turn in the three path, flattened in the lane and saved the show. MISSING
MAURICE chased along the inside, angled out three to four wide on the far turn and improved position. CROSS INDIAN chased three wide on the first turn,
outside a rival on the backstretch, rounded the far turn between rivals, drifted out midstretch and had to be corrected, then failed to rally after. BIG EVENT
lost his path when the leader angled in on the first turn, tracked out of range in the middle stages, coaxed along the rail into the stretch and failed to rally.
MONGOLIAN BONUS raced in the second flight, moved out on the backstretch, went five wide into the far turn, angled down to the three path and made no
impact. AWKWARD MORNING stumbled leaving the gate, raced four to five wide around both turns from off the pace and was never a factor. SYNC trailed
in the three path early, remained three wide into the stretch and never got invovled.

ROYAL ADDRESS (IRE) stalked the pacesetter outside a rival into the turn, eased out and went four wide crossing the dirt, bid three deep in the furlong
grounds, dueled with BIG SWEEP and dug in to prove best in the end. BIG SWEEP stalked the pace from inside, launched a rail bid past the eight pole,
dueled with the winner late and was edged for the victory. SHE'S SO NICE (IRE) stumbled leaving the gate but recovered quickly to clear the field, showed
the way down the hill and into the stretch, challenged from both sides past the eighth pole, relinquished the lead with a sixteenth to go and held on for the
show. MISS FIA forwardly placed early on, went two wide into the turn, three wide crossing the dirt, got put in tight and checked between rivals at the top of
the stretch, moved out and continued willingly to the wire. CALIFORNIA KOOK broke a bit slow, tracked three deep into the turn, remained three wide into
the stretch and needed to find more in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SMILING GOODBYE away quickly then ceded control early, bid two wide into the turn, lost contact at the quarter pole, continued to give chase through the
lane, then came back on from outside in deep stretch and got up. SAWASDEE showed early speed then took full control near the nine-sixteenths pole, got
pressured from outside into the turn, cleared with a quarter mile left to run, remained unchallenged to midstretch, then was confronted by SMILING
GOODBYE again in the final sixteenth and got nailed at the wire. DUTCH BUS chased wide up the backstretch, four wide through the turn and finished
willingly for the show honors. ARTHUR SPOONER chased three then two wide on the turn and flattened out. FUNKENSTEIN was off a bit slow to begin,
drifted five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. ROMEO'S GLORY broke a step slow, traveled along the inside then eased out to the three path around
the turn and failed to menace. SPEED GRAZY broke slow, moved closer up the backstretch, chased a bit off the rail into the lane and weakened.
FORGOTTEN VOWS was off a bit slow, coaxed along the inside near the back, saved ground to the stretch and was outrun.

Footnotes
COUNTESS ROSINA (IRE) was off slow from outside, got bumped and altered out midway around the turn, took aim three wide into the stretch, drifted
inward in the final furlong and drove clear. SNARK pressed the pace from outside, lost touch with leader and chased two wide leaving the turn, re-bid
between rivals with a furlong remaining and got outkicked by the winner. SCENIC MASTERPIECE stalked up the backstretch and moved inside, brushed
with rivals and bobbled midway around the turn, lacked room with a sixteenth to go, tipped off the rail and gained the show. TOPOLINA broke alertly on the
inside, set the pace under pressure from SNARK, shook free and led clear into the stretch, lost command in midstretch and got edged for the show.
VIVANDO stalked the pace outside rivals, went two wide into the turn, got bumped between foes around the bend, continued to give chase through the lane,
got floated out late and lacked a bid. MONEY BABY broke slow, bobbled and got bumped from outside at the start, tracked along the inside, steadied into
the turn, remained inside to the stretch and made no impact. YADIAMA became fractious in the gate and had to be reloaded, was off slow, came in and
bumped VIOLENT RUNNER in the beginning, steadied past the nine-sixteenths pole, was in a bit tight entering the turn, traveled two wide to the stretch and
came up empty. VIOLENT RUNNER broke slow and got knocked into inner rival at the start, jumped a bit over the dirt crossing then checked between rivals
shortly after, trailed two then three wide on the turn and had little left for the drive.
