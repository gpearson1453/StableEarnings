Footnotes
HALO JAX tracked the early leader, moved up three wide around the far turn through the stretch and drew clear late under strong pressure. JONO sprinted
clear early on, raced along the inside in the stretch and held the place position. FEISTY BIRD was off a step slow, raced four wide near the eighth and kept
on to the wire. THE GREATEST EAGLE was allowed to settle early on, raced two to three wide and had not enough in the drive. BUD MINISTER lunged at
the break, raced for wide into the upper stretch and had no rally. SING N SPURS stalked the pace from the inside and tired. GERDY'S BOY was slow early
and never was a factor. SCHLEICHER raced far back and never threatened.

Footnotes
SENOR BLAIR stalked the pace, moved up three wide to take command entering the upper stretch and drew off to be well clear under steady handling.
LITTLE NO WAY pressed the early pace, raced two wide and was no match for the winner. MASTERFUL STRIDE was allowed to settle along the inside,
raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no final winning bid. I CALL SHOTGUN stalked the pace, raced four wide in the lane and had not enough in the
drive. LOOKING FOR BULL dropped back early, raced towards the inside and had no response. STICKINWITHTHEGUYS raced three to four wide in lane
and never was a factor. DREAM BABY DREAM was sent along early and gave way. DANCE EVEN failed to menace. Internal racing fractions were
unavailable.
