WHOS DALLINS DADDY broke out, set a pressured pace to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held well in a driving finish. CURLING SECRET bumped
at the start, stalked inside, angled out on the turn, swung wide, closed steadily and gained late to narrow the gap. LUVTHEONEURWITH veered out and
was impeded at the start, raced in the back and offered a mild bid inside to earn show. TANGLED THOUGHTS was crowded and ducked out at the start,
trailed the field and passed tiring rivals. GATO SICILIANO broke in and bumped at the start, pressed the pace while racing along the inside, fell back on the
turn, angled out to be widest in the drive and lacked a further response. O G GULFSTREAM GUS showed speed to the turn, dropped back and gave way.
The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning the start. No change was made.

Footnotes
ROYAL SEEKER advanced around the turn, assumed command three across entering the stretch, drew off and extended his lead under mild urging. TEN
CARAT ROCK bumped and was squeezed at the start, advanced inside, angled out for the drive and earned place while no match for the winner. VALLEY
WILDCAT was intimidated and veered in on the backstretch, saved ground, angled out to bid seven wide and got up for show. PREMIER LEAGUE was
slow early, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. FORTY FATHOMS got away well to set the pace to the turn, fell back and faded
through the stretch. RUN FOREVER bumped at the start, showed speed to the turn and gave way. FATS DOMINUS broke in, pressed the pace along the
inside, challenged for the lead on the turn, weakened and stopped.

swung wide leaving the turn, dueled for the lead, was outfinished and caught for second. TOTHEMOONANDBACK vied three across, was carried out
leaving the turn, fell back and continued in a steady effort. PALACE STAR saved ground, bid along the rail on the turn to duel for the lead, hung late and lost
position. LAURA BELLE vied between horses to the turn and gave way. SIZZLING GRACE saved ground, lacked a response and showed little.

SILVERBULLITBADGER bumped at the start, led early, fell back, came again between horses, was carried out leaving the turn, closed willingly and drew
clear. COASTAL KING bumped at the start, pressed the pace, was carried out leaving the turn, angled back in and closed steadily to earn place.
MEMOLOTSAMISCHIEF moved up inside to assume command, swung wide leaving the turn, continued willingly and hung late. EVIL ROCKS broke
awkwardly, was never far off the pace and lacked a rally. PLAYING FIELD broke in, raced in the back, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid.
ASSURANCE was carried out leaving the turn and was outrun. WHATISAY was not a factor. INCREDIBE MO broke in and failed to threaten in an even
effort.

Footnotes
FREIBURG was void of early speed, went widest in the drive, closed with a rush and got up near the wire. JAZZ TOWN rallied four wide on the turn, went
willingly to the wire, had the lead late and was caught. TIM'S BUDDY broke out, set a pressured pace, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a
game effort. OUT FOR JUSTICE pressed the pace, bid willingly and didn't have enough late. SIR DEPUTY pressed the pace, fell back into the turn, came
again to duel and didn't have enough late. FAMOUS ROCK STAR pressed the pace while racing inside, bid and hung. LIMITED OFFER raced evenly and
was not a threat. FINAL ROSE was outrun.
