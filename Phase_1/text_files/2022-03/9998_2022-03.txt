Footnotes
FLUFFPOINT prompted the pace two wide, bid turning for home, drew clear leaving the three sixteenths pole, and lasted from an outer rallying rival to the
wire. INTO WISHING raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, shifted outwardly in midstretch while bidding for place, then rallied in hopes of
reeling in the clear tiring leader late, but missed. STEALING APRIORITY trailed, swung to the five path entering the lane, and moved up on his left lead.
TOOL BOX set the pace inside of a prompting FLUFFPOINT, got headed by that foe passing the quarter pole, and weakened in upper stretch. TRIPPER
JOHN stalked the top pair from the three path around the turn, drifted to the four path entering the lane, then tired on his left lead. THE THREE KS saved
ground in midpack, but faded. TOTALLY ADDICTED backed out between horses early on despite those foes being clear, took the turn in the four path while
off of the pace, got floated to the six path entering the lane, and made little impact.

Footnotes
PERRINS took a bump from an outer foe soon after the start, settled well back in the two path, took the far turn in the three path, swung out entering the
lane, then to the seven path leaving quarter pole, rallied to bid outside of rivals entering the final furlong, and drove clear in the final sixteenth. MO CREDO
stalked along the inside, then from a path off of the rail around the far turn, grinded away between horses in upper stretch to bid inside of the leader at the
furlong grounds, but was outkicked entering the final sixteenth. NORTHERNREFLECTION tracked in the three path around the first turn, chased along the
rail through the far turn, but was one paced through the lane, and dead heated with an outer foe for show. CHARLIE G took both turns in the four path while
tracking from off of the pace, tipped to the five path and outside of the leader as that foe crossed over passing the quarter pole, but was outkicked by an
outer rival at the furlong grounds, then kept on to dead heat for show. RY DONT LIE set a clear pace in the three path around the first turn before shifting to
the five path entering the backstretch, tucked back down to the three path a furlong late, but bore back out to the five path around the far turn, tucked down
to the four path passing the quarter pole to hold an advantage to the furlong grounds, but was swallowed between horses at that marker. MORE HARDER
saved ground around both turns while off of the pace, shifted to the four path at the quarter pole, then to the six path in midstretch, but made little impact.
HELAIRE stalked two wide, then from the three path around the far turn, but weakened between horses at the three sixteenths pole. CATCHIN DRAMA
bumped an inner foe soon after the start, then was outrun and showed little.

Footnotes
RUNANDHIDE WIND stalked three wide, grinded away through midstretch while lugging inwardly from right handed cropping, ranged up in the final furlong
after the rider changed to left handed urging, sustained a bid entering the final sixteenth, and prevailed at the wire. COURTHOUSE COVE set the pace
inside of a vying rival, shook clear of that foe passing the quarter pole, held sway through midstretch, met RUNANDHIDE WIND's bid in the final sixteenth,
and got nailed on the wire. GOLDEN PEGASUS trailed, swung to the five path entering the lane, and rallied willingly to reach show late. GOLDEN
PASSAGE tracked two wide and between horses around the turn, chased along the rail through upper stretch, shifted outside of a tiring SPEEDY G at the
furlong grounds to bid for show outside of that foe in the final sixteenth, but was outfinished by an outer rival late. SPEEDY G pressed the pace two wide,
vied around the turn, but gave way at the quarter pole, and tired through the lane. FEROCITY chased along the inside, but yielded into the turn.

NET A BEAR tracked the leading pair from the three path, chased them while mildly failing to keep pace around the far turn, but quickened in the six path in
upper stretch to range up approaching midstretch, bid at the furlong grounds, dueled while forging a narrow advantage entering the final sixteenth, and
edged ahead late. FORT POLK prompted the pace two wide, vied into the far turn, gained a slight edge at the five sixteenths pole, held in the three path
through upper stretch, disposed of her inner counterpart at the furlong grounds while meeting NET A BEAR's challenge, battled with that foe thereafter, but
was headed entering the final sixteenth. OFFSPRING set the pace inside of a vying FORT POLK, got headed by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, fought
on through upper stretch, but gave way at the furlong grounds. BLESSED ANNA tracked along the inside, but made little impact.

Footnotes
WOW ME FAST took a bump from an inner foe at th start, tracked in the two path early on before tipping to the four path at the five furlong pole, moved past
a pair of inner rival entering the far turn to take aim on the clear leader from the three path around that bend, edged closer entering the lane, bid at the
furlong grounds, got brushed passing that marker, and edged clear through the final sixteenth. DIAL TEN FOR G bobbled and bumped an outer foe at the
start, set a clear pace in the three to two path around the first turn, maintained a margin entering the lane as an outer WOW ME FAST closed in, but was
caught by that foe passing the furlong grounds, exchanged a mild brush leaving that junction, then gave way a sixteenth later, and was second best.
BURNING DESIRE stalked in the four to two path around the first turn, came under strong urging inside of rivals into the far turn, and failed to menace.
FREEZE THE DAY tracked from the outside and in the five to four path around the first turn, chased the clear leader down the backstretch, but weakened
between a pair of rivals into the far turn, and was done early. DASHING HERO showed little.

Footnotes
DOWAGIAC CHIEF set the pace, dictated terms while well in hand down the backstretch, met RUSSIAN TANK's challenge passing the half mile pole,
allowed that rival to gain a minor advantage at the five sixteenths pole, but responded readily when set down at the quarter pole, swiftly repelled his outer
foe at that marker, and willingly drew off through the lane. TOMMY BEE stalked two wide, pressed the leader into the backstretch, shifted a bit outwardly
approaching the half mile pole as RUSSIAN TANK maneuver alongside, allowed that foe to go on before taking a bump from him passing that marker,
stalked the top pair from the three path around the far turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, then regained place at the three sixteenths pole while
not threatening the leader, and proved second best. IBERVILLE settled off of the pace in the three path, trailed at the five furlong pole, then surpassed tiring
rivals on either side in the final furlong while not menacing. SILENT TAP laid off of the pace in the four to three path, shifted to the seven path in upper
stretch, and failed to factor before tiring late. RUSSIAN TANK tracked two wide, tipped three wide entering the backstretch, moved outside of the top pair
approaching the half mile pole, got minorly carried out by an inner TOMMY BEE while doing so, came back in and bumped that foe at that marker while the
rider scolded his inner competitor, vied outside of DOWAGIAC CHIEF into the far turn, led briefly at the five sixteenths marker, but proved no match for that
foe at the quarter pole, and weakened. HOLY CITY tracked along the inside, and faded.

Footnotes
COSMIC TRAIN trailed early on, commenced a gain around the far turn, swung five wide entering the lane, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, dueled with
BIG CHOPPER through the final furlong, and prevailed. BIG CHOPPER veered outwardly and bumped the gate while breaking slowly, tracked in the three
path, tugged two wide and between horses into the far turn, settled and stalked the trio of leaders from the inside around that bend, tipped outside of them in
upper stretch as an outer COSMIC TRAIN rallied alongside, bid along with that foe passing the furlong grounds, dueled through the late stages, but was
bested. TAMBOURINE STAR stalked four wide and in the five path around the first turn, engaged the leading pair from the four path into the far turn, bid
with five sixteenths to run, showed the way entering the lane, but was outkicked by a pair of outer rivals passing the furlong pole. BIND FAITH stalked in the
three path around the first turn, tucked to the rail down the backstretch, checked mildly approaching the far turn while inside of foes, shifted to the two path
around that bend, and lacked a bid. EDDIE'S HUMOR pressed two wide from the three path, vied between horses around the far turn, but weakened in
upper stretch. RUNNINGINTHEMONEY set the pace while a path off of the inner railing, vied inside of a pair of foes around the far turn, but weakened
entering the lane. I LIKE DREAMING laid off of the pace along the inside, and never got involved. THE RIDER OF BLIND FAITH CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST
THE RIDER OF BIG CHOPPER FOR INTERFERENCE INTO THE FAR TURN, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
MANGELSEN set a clear advantage while intentionally staying well off of the inner rail, drifted further out through midstretch as an inner TREYS MIDNITE
MOON produced a rail challenge, but held through the late stages. TREYS MIDNITE MOON settled off of the pace in the two to three paths, shifted inwardly
at the quarter pole for clear sailing, sustained a rail rally to bid in the final furlong, but was denied by the outer leader. BALLINONABUDJET tracked along
the inside, gained three wide around the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch to remain outside of the clear leader, and kept on to secure show. MR.
UNIVERSE trailed around both turns, then surpassed outer tiring foes without menacing. CHANGI stalked along the inside, but drifted a few paths outwardly
at the quarter pole, and tired. CITY PARK stalked two wide, but weakened while shying from an inner drifting foe at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
NEW YEAR'S PARTY stalked along the inside, swung five wide entering the lane, rallied in the final furlong, and reeled in the leader on the wire.
TUFFOLOGY pressed three wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch, but was nailed on the wire. CUSTOM FOR CARLITA tracked
four wide, got floated six wide entering the lane, but lacked a rally between horses. ACTIVE GIRL was put to a bit of tight quarters at the start after breaking
a step slowly, raced off of the pace in the three path around the turn, swung seven wide entering the lane, produced a mild kick to vie for minor rewards in
the final furlong, but flattened out. GILDED APPLE tracked from off of the pace along the inside, shifted four wide at the furlong grounds, but lacked a kick.
POINT OF VICTORY dueled for the lead two wide, then from between horses at the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked in upper stretch, and weekend.
FOR REAL ALICE dueled for the lead along the inside, but yielded to a pair of outer rivals at the quarter pole, and was eased through the lane. KEHRON'S
CREED was outrun.
