in late stretch and was up in the final strides. SUPER LEGS chased the pace while two wide, bid on the far turn came out four wide in the stretch to close
willingly in end. BOLD LEGEND was quick to set the pace, then dueled from the inside on the backstretch, was in a long drive, but weakened in the end.
SHE IS A BLING settled three wide on the backstretch, then angled in along the rail to rally on the far turn, but flattened out in the stretch. NOCTURNAL
MISSION was well placed early, then dueled for the lead while two wide, continued to bid on the far turn but faltered in the stretch drive. WEST COAST
TEMPLE was unhurried early and no factor. FETCHING FURY stalked the leaders while three wide, made four wide bid on the far turn and stopped.
