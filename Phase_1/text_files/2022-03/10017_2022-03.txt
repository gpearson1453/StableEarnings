Footnotes
GOTTA LOVE IKE showed good early speed to set all the pace and held well to be well clear under steady pressure. LITTLE TOE stalked the pace, moved
up five wide through the lane and finished second best. GOOSE DRANK WINE was allowed to settle early, angled six wide through the stretch run and
made a good late bid. DANCE DOCTOR stalked the early going, raced three wide between rivals and had no final winning bid. RANDOM AFFAIR stalked
the pace from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. FLY FIRST CLASS pressed the early leader while racing two wide and gave way. GOLD
NOTE was slow early, raced five wide through the stretch run and never was a factor. MASTERFUL STRIDE dropped back early, raced six wide into the
upper stretch and never threatened. LET'S GO PLACES saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
ITS A WRAP was unhurried early, moved up three wide through the far turn, angled in to the rail in the stretch drive, surged late and got up under strong
handling. STEPHEN'S ANSWER showed good early speed, led inside the sixteenth pole and was wore down late. OURBESTFRIEND D L pressed the early
pace, raced three wide in the lane and weakened. FAYETTE WARRIOR settled off the early pace, moved around the far turn, raced along the inside and
had no final winning bid. HOLDING FAST dropped back early, raced four wide in the lane and had no response. CAESARTHERULER raced five wide
around the first turn, was four wide near the eighth pole and never threatened. SOUTHGATE dropped back early, raced six wide into the upper stretch and
never was a factor. HANSENS MISCHIEF settled off the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn and never was a factor. MARQUEE
THUNDER was coaxed along early and faded.

from the inside and weakened a bit late. DREAM BABY DREAM stalked the pace, raced three to four wide and had no final winning bid. CHUCKMATE was
allowed to settle in the early stages, raced five wide through the upper stretch and made a mild late gain. STICKINWITHTHEGUYS was slow early, raced
four wide and never was a factor. MIDNIGHT DESTINY was off a step slow, raced four wide around the far turn and never threatened. GREEN CARD raced
