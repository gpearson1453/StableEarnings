led briefly in the stretch then faltered. FICTIONALFAIRYTALE led narrowly between rivals to the stretch and faltered. LATE TO THE SHOW reserved early,

ARGENTINA GIRL vied inside for the lead, dueled on the backside, shook free on the far turn, bumped soundly with EIGHT DANZAS at the top of the
stretch, then drew clear under urging. EIGHT DANZAS raced off the early pace, then tracked inside, made a rail bid at the quarter pole, drifted out some
entering the stretch, bumped soundly with ARGENTINA GIRL, then dug in through the stretch run and proved second best. PEACH PERFECT was off
slowly, trailed the field, saved ground, moved up inside on the far turn, angled out in the stretch and rallied mildly. IMAGISM tracked on the inside, came
three wide into the lane, lacked a rally and weakened. PAGEANT PRINCESS was bumped at the start, stalked outside, continued three wide, went four
wide on the far turn and tired. HOLD ME CLOSER was bumped at the start, vied two wide for the lead, dueled and gave way. A Jockey's Objection by the
rider of EIGHT DANZAS against the winner was dismissed.

Footnotes
FLEETERTHAN -saved ground throughout, bid into the stretch and edged ahead through the stretch. SENSE A MILLION prompted the pace outside,
reached even terms at the quarter pole, led briefly in the stretch and finished gamely. CLOSET SHOPPER settled close up outside, was asked for run on
the turn then made a mild late gain. BRAVO REGINA broke slowest, advanced inside on the turn and continued well. SOLID GOLD DANCER set a clear
pace inside through the opening quarter, was collared on the turn then came up empty. ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE angled outside in the opening quarter,
moved wide into the stretch and flattened out. LIL TATER dropped back outside and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
MISSION WRAPITUP vied inside for the lead, dueled inside of MANOLETE on the turn, battled with that rival to the eighth pole, then took over and drew
clear under urging. ALEJANDRO'S TEAM raced off the pace inside, moved up on the turn, came three wide into the lane, angled in and finished willingly
inside for the place award. MACH TRIAL tracked on the inside, then stalked, chased three wide on the turn and rallied mildly outside for third. EXCHEQUER
vied between rivals for the early lead, chased inside on the turn and weakened. MANOLETE steadied at the start, made an early four wide bid, dueled two
wide on the turn, battled to the furlong marker and then gave way readily. DRENA'S BULLET raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. LAWN BOY
(GB) stumbled at the start, raced off the pace inside and had no rally. DON'T POKE THE CAT raced two wide off the pace, angled out entering the stretch
and did not factor. RISQUE REBEL vied three wide for the lead, then chased and gave way.
