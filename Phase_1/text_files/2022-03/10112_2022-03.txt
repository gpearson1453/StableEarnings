WHAT A RUSH sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and widened through the stretch under a strong hand ride to win as much the best.
ELLADA PINOT never far back, rallied four wide through the far turn and finished second best. THE GOSPEL OF MARK unhurried early, swung wide and
passed tiring rivals. VENTURE ON trailed through the clubhouse turn, advanced along the inside through the far turn then failed to sustain that bid.
CATMAN JACK chased the winner from the five and six paths for six furlongs then gave way in the stretch. ZIP IT QUICK was through after a half.

Footnotes
AYKIZ bumped with JUSTASMALLTOWNGIRL shortly after the start, dueled for the lead two wide into the turn, took command then widened the balance of
the trip to win as much the best under a strong hand ride. NEVER AT ALL (FR) allowed to settle, rallied late between horses in the four path and finished
clear for second. TACK WISE with the second flight, swung wide and went evenly. WHAT'S SO FUNNY unhurried early, rallied determinedly along the rail
into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. JUSTASMALLTOWNGIRL was bumped by the winner early, offered a mild bid in the three path into the
stretch then came up empty. IMA SURE BET was no factor. DANA'S CONQUEST battled with the winner near the inside into the turn, swung wide and
gave way. WICKED KITTY was outrun.

SWEET QUEEN BEE prompted the pace two wide in the six path until deep stretch, dug in under strong handling to make the lead late and edged clear.
BEAV'S BOO was forced out brushing with OFFTHEROADAGAIN near the half mile pole, swung wide and closed a gap late mid track. ABERRATION
rushed to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace in the five path until deep stretch then was outfinished. BOUDOIR BURLESQUE near the inside
early, drifted out near the half mile marker, advanced on the turn and into the stretch then leveled off. SKY had brief speed. OFFTHEROADAGAIN was
brushed and forced outward near the half mile pole then trailed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED

UNCLE KEVIN trailed down the backstretch, circled his rivals with a burst of speed through the stretch and drew off to win in hand. GIO SAMMY stalked
pace the early pace, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole, matched strides until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. BORN TO BE
KING allowed to settle, split horses two wide through mid stretch and was steadily gaining ground late. ANOTHER BREEZE was hustled to the lead soon
after the start, set a pressured pace along the inside until mid stretch then gave way. HIT THIS TOWN stalked the early pace, loomed boldly three wide on
the turn then came up empty. O'HAIRE had brief speed. FLAMING HOT pressed the pace two wide into the turn and was used up.
