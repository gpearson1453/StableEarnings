Footnotes
DARK NINJA had sharp speed to the front, led all poles while well handled and held sway to wire. ANYTIMEALLTHETIME chased leader to deep stretch,
kept on in the final stages but could not get past. REMEMBER THE MAINE raced evenly to the stretch but ran on for show while well clear of the rest. THE
LAST OPTION brief speed and chased to the turn but gave in and faded in stretch run. HERE'S CARLOS never factored. O CIGANO no speed from outside
and never menaced. FEELING IT inside chase while in tight going to turn and backed up readily. CALL WEST antsy in the gate, reared at the start and lost
all chance.

HONORABLE HERO cleared early, pressured from the half, well handled out of the far turn and stretch to hold sway at the wire. COURT AND SPARK
tracked leader with a clear shot to the wire but outgamed to the wire. GRAY HOPE unhurried inside to far turn, rallied along late for the show spot.
AREYOUTALKINGTOME chased from off rail to far turn, angled in while fading in the stretch run. TILL THEN raced widest into first turn while evenly
throughout. DOWN HOME KITTEN tracked from off rail to the half and gave way, faded back. KEARNY COUNTY never factored.

Footnotes
NARROWS BRIDGE speed to the front, well rationed throughout and held sway to the wire under steady handling. KITTEN ROCKS inside trip to far turn,
angled out widest and rallied for place. TARANTA (IRE) unhurried to far turn, rallied five wide into stretch for the show spot. TEMPTATION EYES saved
ground while in a bit tight, raced along evenly with no late gain. MOMMY BERTA five wide run into first turn, tracked leaders but used up in the stretch run
and faltered. CLASSY LYNN chased leader to far turn, could not go on and faded back readily. PAULAS GAME a bit of a slow start and never menaced
thereafter. MISS HOLIDAY (ARG) had a sluggish start and never threatened thereafter. UNWANTED INPUT raced six wide into first turn while close up to
the half but gave in and stopped.
