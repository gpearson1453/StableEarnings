Footnotes
ROCKYSBUCKAROO, in touch between foes prompting the pace in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival on the turn, edged forward
nearing upper stretch and maintained a narrow advantage to the end under right handed encouragement. HOT AND HEAVY, under some pressure in early
stages while angling to the inside tracking off the first flight, tipped out nearing midstretch to split foes just off the inside and continued willingly to close the
gap just inside the winner in late stages. OPTIMAL COURAGE, forwardly placed tracking just off the leaders, continued with a steady effort in that path
through the turn to upper stretch and finished evenly while being outkicked by the top pair. IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK, urged inside foes dictating the pace on
a narrow advantage to the turn, dueled inside the eventual winner on the bend and weakened in the drive. D'ROCK tracked off the first flight between foes
racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch.

Footnotes
AMERICAN EMPRESS was urged to the lead inside foes racing to the first turn, tipped off the rail racing into the backstretch while widening her advantage,
held sway on a clear margin through the far turn, widened under pressure past midstretch and was taken in hand late once the issue was decided.
PEACELOVENKARMA tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight remaining in the three path to the backstretch, continued with a steady effort in
that path to the stretch but couldn't gain terms with the winner while proving best of the others. SPANISH DELIGHT tracked the pacesetter outside foes in
second flight racing in the four path to the far turn, angled inwards to race between rivals entering the stretch and edged a rival for a share. BELLE GOSSE
tracked the pacesetter along the inside as part of the second flight racing to the far turn, saved ground to the lane and faded past midstretch. BRYCENS
GOLD was rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the first turn, shifted inwards entering the backstretch while being urged in brief pursuit of the
pacesetter between foes but came up empty racing into the lane. ROYAL ROCKER, reserved between foes in the last flight to the backstretch, dropped out
early.

Footnotes
BEAUTY GENIUS, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace in the opening half, pressed that foe racing into the far turn, took over entering upper stretch
while shifting out a bit but maintained the advantage to the end under steady pressure. GOODBYE CAROLINA angled to the inside early tracking just off the
leaders to the backstretch, swung out approaching upper stretch while being prompted to advance, drifted out to the six path racing past midstretch but
continued with interest to close the gap. SHES A THREAT tracked the leaders a bit off the inside from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch,
then continued evenly between foes in late stages to prevail for a share. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY hopped at the start, settled last along the inside racing to
the far turn, tipped out racing into the stretch and split foes in late stages to gain position to the end. IDAKA was urged dictating the pace on a narrow
advantage along the rail, dueled for command through the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. REYNA DE VERANO, off a step slowly, settled outside
foes dropping off the second flight, was prompted to make some brief progress three wide after a half but came up empty nearing the lane. SCHATZI
worked her way to the inside while dropping well off the leaders, tipped out on the far turn but offered no rally. OB LA DI settled between foes in the last
flight and failed to menace thereafter. UPPER SPEED DS dropped out of contention early. WHISPERING WANDA tracked off the second flight along the
inside in the opening half and steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
LINDSEY LUCK broke readily, was taken in hand while being eased off the leaders between foes to drop off the second flight on the backstretch, responded
when given her cue entering the turn to rally sharply to contention between foes in upper stretch, split foes just off the inside leaving the furlong marker, then
moved to challenge inside the pacesetter in the closing stages and just edged that foe in time under firm right handed encouragement. LOVERS AT
MIDNIGHT angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival on the backstretch, edged forward nearing upper stretch, shook clear racing through the lane but
was collared at the wire. MISS INEZ, held up just after the start dropping well off the second flight on the backstretch, switched out four wide racing into the
turn while steadily advancing to contention, continued in that path through the stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. BALLYMENA tracked the leaders
four wide in second flight in early stages, steadily gained on the leaders three wide on the turn to lodge a bid nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed
final response. SABELLE, urged disputing the pace while angling to the inside racing through the backstretch, dueled inside foes on the turn and gave way
into upper stretch. SO SWELL swerved just after the start brushing AZULENE, was reserved last racing to the turn and failed to menace. HELENS SPIRIT
tracked the leaders between foes in second flight on the backstretch and steadily faded racing into the turn. AZULENE, brushed just after the start, was
urged along the inside pursuing the leaders on the backstretch but was spent early.

Footnotes
BRAMBLE BAY, forwardly placed along the rail stalking just inside the pacesetter, moved to wrest the advantage racing into the far turn, held sway into the
stretch and maintained a safe margin under brisk handling. GENNIE HIGHWAY angled to the inside leaving the chute tracking just off the second flight,
continued along the rail on the backstretch steadily gaining position inside foes entering the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with
interest to edge a rival for the place honors. INGRASSIA, in touch with the pacesetter three deep stalking just off that rival to the backstretch, moved to
press the issue in that path entering the far turn, continued in pursuit of the winner outside a rival into upper stretch and was outkicked for second. DANCE
WARRIOR tracked off the first flight between foes just off the inside racing to the backstretch and continued evenly into the lane. PYTHONESS, caught four
wide leaving chute, tracked outside rivals to the backstretch and steadily faded racing through the far turn. ZARINA hopped at the start, settled last to the far
turn and failed to mount a serious challenge. SUMMER DAY was urged dictating the pace on a narrow advantage between foes in the opening half, was
headed racing into the far turn, drifted out nearing upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
IRISH VALOR, forwardly placed along the inside stalking the pacesetter, moved to press the issue inside that foe racing into the far turn, tipped out while
being roused to a clear advantage racing past the furlong marker and held ROARING RIVER grudgingly to the end under firm handling. The latter raced four
wide into the first turn while coming under rating to drop off the first turn, continued under patient handling to the second bend, was urged to challenge four
wide racing into upper stretch, shifted inwards to close the gap on the winner in the closing stages but was just outkicked. EL SAMURO settled along the
inside to the backstretch, came under prompting to advance entering the far turn while shifting off the inside, angled out five wide in upper stretch, then
found some late response to gain a share in the closing stages. BROADWAY PETE, in touch with the pacesetter three wide attending the pace in the
opening half, was urged to advance between foes in that path nearing upper stretch but weakened in the drive. CANDY CRUSHEM tracked off the first flight
between foes racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail racing through the far turn and steadily faded in the drive. CLIFFY, urged between foes dictating
the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening half, dueled for command into the far turn and gave way between racing into the stretch. JEGOS FIRE
settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never gained contention.

Footnotes
SIR SAFFER sped to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a clear margin to upper stretch, drifted out late but held rivals on
a safe margin under firm handling. TAP THE CANDY, pulling a bit against rating in the opening stages, tracked just off the leaders three wide to the
backstretch, continued with a steady advance in that path racing into the stretch and prevailed for second. ROCK THE STARS was settled outside foes
racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide on the far turn, then five wide nearing upper stretch but continued willingly in that path to close
the gap to the end. WINTER'S GHOST, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, shifted inwards while continuing in
pursuit of the winner into the stretch but weakened late. KARL CARES angled to the inside early, saved ground throughout, then switched outside a tiring
rival racing into the stretch while continuing with interest to improve position. MAPACHE G, off slowly, was settled last to the backstretch, saved ground
gaining position into the lane, was held up avoiding traffic midstretch and altered course to gain some position four wide in the closing stages. MOON DOG
tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the far turn and faded into the stretch. STRONG EAGLE, caught four wide racing to the backstretch,
never gained contention. BRAMBLE BEACH angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, came under pressure to
advance on the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. WONDER WATER, caught five wide leaving the chute, then racing to the first turn, shifted inwards
on the backstretch to track the pace between foes but faded after a half.

Footnotes
U U STAR broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival on the backstretch, took over racing into the turn to open a commanding advantage racing into
the stretch and widened the margin late while being kept to the task. LEMON CREEK LOUIE, off slowly, was settled well off the leaders while angling inside
on the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and proved best of the others. CLASSIC ESCAPE ducked out at the start crossing over the
path of KAPHAVATA, was urged along the rail pursuing the leaders into the turn but lacked the needed final bid. RAMIRIN tracked off the second flight
outside a rival in the opening stages, angled out to race four wide between foes nearing upper stretch but offered no rally. KAPHAVATA, cut off momentarily
at the start, angled to the inside to track off the second flight, saved ground to the lane and faded in the drive. BROADWAY RUCKUS tracked the leaders
between foes in second flight racing to the turn and steadily faded into the lane. WANNA WOW YOU, outpaced through the backstretch, proved no factor.
JERICHOS BATTLE briefly contested the pace while angling to the inside in the opening quarter and emptied out nearing upper stretch.

SHE MAKES A POINT was settled in hand outside foes dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance splitting rivals
four deep after a half, advanced in that path racing into the far turn to gain terms with PEACHTREE ROAD racing into upper stretch, then wrested the
advantage and went clear late under firm encouragement. The latter, caught four wide leaving the chute racing into the first turn, was prompted to gain a
forward placing three deep racing just off the first flight nearing the backstretch, moved to challenge for command in that path racing through the far turn,
resisted the winner's bid to midstretch but proved only second best. SITTING PRETTY, reserved outside a rival in the last flight to the backstretch, angled
inside after a half, gained some position inside foes on the far turn, switched out four wide entering the lane and continued with an effort to improve position.
BYRDIE HOWE tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. BEASTIE
GIRL settled last racing to the backstretch, swung outside foes leaving the far turn to race five wide into the lane, lugged in racing through the stretch but
gained position to the end. WEEZY DOES IT raced in close quarters just off the leaders to the first turn, tracked the pace between foes in second flight to
the far turn and faded into upper stretch. APPROACH THE DAWN (IRE) angled inwards while being urged prompting a rival's pace, pressed the pace
between foes into the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. CAPACIOUS, urged inside rivals disputing the pace in the opening half, gave way racing into
the far turn. BEACH BREEZE tracked off the first flight three wide between foes racing to the backstretch, drifted out midway through the backstretch and
soon gave way. AGELESS ARTIST angled to the inside early and soon dropped out.
