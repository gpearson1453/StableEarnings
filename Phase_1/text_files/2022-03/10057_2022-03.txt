KIKI KARTEL popped and gone. TRAVELIN PERRY no match, clear second. WEEFIREABUNCH best stride late. VQ PAULS LEGACY bid, late interest.
CUZ SHES XTRA lacked experience. INSEPARABLE FRIENDS choppy early strides. FIRST RELENTLESS broke inward. OUR HIDDEN SECRET steadily
faded. PAINTED SPIRITS never fired.
