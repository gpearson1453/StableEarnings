Footnotes
DIAL ME MAYBE was forwardly placed early on, took command with a quick move approaching the far turn, built a clear lead through upper stretch and
remained well clear under steady pressure. SPRINKLE THIS stalked the early pace, raced near the inside nearing the quarter pole, was two to three wide in
the drive and no match for the winner. ASGATA was quick to begin to set the pace early, raced off the inside down the backstretch, raced four to five wide
through the upper stretch and had not enough for the top pair. FOXYNBOSSY was off slowly, dropped back early on, raced four wide and had no response.
AWESOME TAP was slow in the early stages and trailed throughout.

JUSTIN TIME showed good early speed to set the early pace from the inside and held gamely through the drive to prove best under steady handling.
BETTER YET stalked the top pair down the backstretch, raced three to four wide through the lane and finished second best. TEACHER DRAMA was slow
early on, raced along the inside near the quarter pole, angled to the four path through the lane and made a good late gain. EARLY FROST was coaxed
along in the early stages while racing two wide and tired readily in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ROCKET BLAST was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, challenged the leader through the upper stretch while racing three to four wide and finished
well to just get up under all out pressure. WONDER IN showed good early speed to set the early pace, dug in through the drive but gave way grudgingly
late. CAUSE OF ACTION was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside near the quarter pole and raced along for third. PASSCODE was forwardly
placed early on, raced along the inside and weakened in the drive. GATOR FIFTY TWO was a bit fractious, reared, tangled at the break, off very slow losing
a considerable amount of ground and never was involved after the troubling break.

VISHNU tracked the early leader while racing two wide, finished well in the drive and drove clear. SUPER HOUDINI was off a step slow, moved up two wide
near the quarter pole, angled five wide through the lane and closed in well to get up for the place position. BOCK stalked the early pace, moved up four wide
near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough for the top pair. BOSSY CAT was allowed to settle early, moved up along the inside but had no final
winning bid in the drive. BIFF was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack early on, raced five to six wide into the lane and never was a factor. SWEEPIN
HARD was slow early, raced four to five wide around the far turn and had no rally. ASHRAQ showed good early speed to set the early pace and gave way.
PEACHY KEEN stalked the pace from the inside and faded.
