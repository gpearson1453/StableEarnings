Footnotes
TEE UP, urged inside foes to gain the advantage after the break, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage into the bend, tipped off the inside racing into
upper stretch and drove clear. SMOOTH AS GLASS, urged three wide prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, couldn't match the winner
but proved best of the others. PROBABLY GRACE, held up avoiding tight quarters at the start, was guided to the inside on the backstretch, switched out
nearing upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position three deep while gaining a share. ORNERY ANGEL tracked just off the first flight a
bit off the inside in the opening stages, angled inwards racing through the turn and came up empty in the drive. U KNOW I B LION switched outside foes in
early stages, was urged between rivals prompting the pace into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. BE BOP A LOLA, shuffled back avoiding tight
quarters at the break, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CHEZ PIERRE (FR) was prompted to a forward placing racing just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, pulled against rating stalking that rival into the
backstretch racing a bit off the inside, responded when given his cue to advance to challenge nearing upper stretch, continued in a protracted skirmish
through late stages but prevailed in time under firm handling. DRAMA CHORUS sped to the lead from the break, dictated terms under light rating to the far
turn, then kept on grudgingly resisting the winner's challenge to the end. BLUE SKY KOWBOY settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch,
switched out three wide racing through the far turn while being prompted to advance but couldn't close the gap on the top pair while edging a rival for a
share. GROUNDED, prompted to a forward placing inside foes, tracked the pacesetter along the inside to the far turn and faded through the stretch. DARK
OAK settled between foes racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside after a half and offered no rally. TALK OR LISTEN (IRE) tracked the leaders
outside foes to the backstretch, was prompted to make a brief bid nearing the far turn but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
BRASS BAND broke readily, disputed the pace between foes, then outside a rival racing to the turn, forged clear racing into upper stretch, widened under
right handed pressure and was taken in hand late once the issue was decided. OVERTHEBLUESKY was settled inside foes racing through the backstretch,
saved ground to upper stretch gathering momentum and prevailed for the place honors inside a rival in the final stages. SABELLE, off a step behind the
leaders, was urged inside the eventual winner forcing the pace in the second furlong into the turn but proved no match racing into the stretch. FABULOUS
PHILLY, in touch with the first flight four wide in the opening quarter, shifted inwards pursuing those rivals three wide into the turn, but proved empty in the
drive. WHITEROSE SPIRIT, forwardly placed three deep between prompting the pace, shifted inwards nearing the bend dropping off the leaders and soon
gave way. KLASSI KASSI settled outside foes racing to the turn and failed to menace. TAP INTO THE HONEY dropped out early.

LORD BERRIER stalked just off the leaders three wide in the opening stages, moved to challenge in that path nearing the bend, was carried out
approaching the three furlong marker, quickly recovered to contest the issue outside a rival through the bend, took over racing into upper stretch, went clear
under pressure and was gathered up once the issue was decided. ITS OVER angled to the inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance,
advanced along the rail on the turn and proved best of the others. QUICK INTRO, urged prompting the pace between foes through the backstretch, was
carried out, then steadied out of tight quarters approaching the three furlong marker but was collected to regain some position with a second effort racing
into the stretch. URBAN WARRIOR tracked off the first flight four wide racing through the backstretch, angled sharply to the inside entering the turn while
being urged to wrest the advantage nearing the three furlong marker, dueled inside the eventual winner through the turn and came up empty racing into
upper stretch. DIVINE CONTROL settled last early and failed to menace. FRIAR TUCK, urged inside foes disputing the pace through the backstretch,
drifted out nearing the turn impeding several rivals while his rider attempted to correct his course but quickly gave way. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE TURN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
BRAMBLE BUSH was rated off the second flight while caught a bit wide to the backstretch, advanced to terms with the leaders when making a sharp move
wide into the second bend, disputed the issue in that path into upper stretch and prevailed in time under firm handling. FANTASTIC RAFAELA rated off the
second flight along the inside in the opening half, came around a rival nearing upper stretch advancing on the leaders, split foes just off the inside and
narrowly prevailed for the place honors in time. NEW WAYS TO DREAM tracked just off the leaders to the backstretch, gained terms with those foes three
deep racing into the far turn, resisted the winner's bid past midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair. STARSHIP BELMONT, forwardly placed tracking
just off the pacesetter in the opening half, was urged to bid for command between foes racing through the far turn, dueled past midstretch and faded late.
CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, then split foes three deep nearing upper stretch to improve her position.
MORENA DANCER settled between foes in the last flight to the backstretch, swung out to race four wide between foes nearing the lane but had no closing
bid. RAHTID was a brief factor inside foes tracking just off the pacesetter but faded after a half. SOLDAT TEMPTATION settled between foes in early
stages, was fanned five wide nearing the lane and proved no threat. LA MAGNOLIA, urged to the lead along the inside racing into the backstretch, emptied
out on the far turn. KINGDOM'S SPIRIT dropped out early.

FORTUNATE FRIENDS, caught four wide between foes racing to the first turn, continued outside a rival as part of the second flight to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance on the pacesetter challenging that rival for command in the three path racing through the far turn, gained a narrow advantage nearing
upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. TAPSOLUTE, off a step slowly, settled well off the leaders to the backstretch, came
around foes on the far turn, angled four wide racing into upper stretch and found his best stride late to prevail for the place honors. CORT'N ASONG tracked
the leaders between foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, switched outside the eventual winner to advance four wide, then three wide
between foes into the stretch but finished evenly late. SEVENTY SEVENTYCAT, reserved along the inside racing to the far turn, swung out to the five path
entering the stretch and made some belated progress. INDY RIDE, caught five wide racing into the first turn, tracked off the second flight outside foes racing
to the far turn and lacked a rally. SOBERANO (FR) settled between foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. VIGO, urged to dictate the pace
along the inside from the outset to the backstretch, gave way after a half. RATTLESNAKE RIDGE was urged pressing the pace outside a rival in the
opening half, dueled for command inside the winner on the far turn and gave out midstretch.

Footnotes
MIRTH 'N MERRIMENT angled inwards racing to the first turn to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside, went clear nearing upper stretch
and responded to firm handling to extend the advantage to the end. LATIN NIKKITA, forwardly placed prompting the eventual winner racing to the
backstretch, proved no match for that rival in the drive but held well for the place honors. EISWEIN tracked off the second flight along the inside from the
outset to the far turn, tipped out racing into upper stretch and continued well enough between foes to edge those rivals narrowly for a share. KATIES A
LADY tracked just off the pacesetter inside a rival as part of the second flight, saved ground to the stretch and faded in late stages. I'M BUZZY tracked the
pace outside foes in second flight, angled three wide racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. STYLE, reserved near the inside in early
stages, switched out after a half to race three deep into the stretch and continued with an even effort. SHESASCOLDASICE settled outside foes in the last
flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. YO YO MON settled between foes and proved no threat. LAP OF LUXURY settled in the last flight
while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch but never seriously menaced. MINING CHROME tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the
backstretch but faded early.

Footnotes
EAST WING, forwardly placed four wide in the opening stages, tracked just off the pacesetter racing three deep into the bend, pressed the issue in that path
racing through the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage while shifting inwards racing into upper stretch and maintained that margin to the end under
firm handling. IRISH DREAM GIRL, forwardly placed inside foes tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, advanced along the rail to bid inside the
winner late but was outkicked. WILLOUGHBY GAP switched out in early stages tracking off the first flight in the three path on the backstretch, shifted out
four wide racing into upper stretch, continued with interest to prevail for a share, then was vanned off the course following the race. ROSE'S CAUSE tracked
off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, was eased back off the pace in the second quarter, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and
made an effort to regain some position. LADY JEAN was urged to the lead between foes in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage
racing to the turn, dueled for command inside the eventual winner remaining off the rail through the bend to upper stretch and gave way in late stages.
BLAZING SKY settled outside foes racing through the backstretch and failed to menace. BALLET SCHOOL angled to the inside in early stages while being
prompted in brief pursuit of the leaders racing into the turn but gave way early. MARTHA'S MISCHIEF proved no factor.

gain some position between foes on the far turn, angled four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail under right
handed pressure. MYSTIC DREAMS, reserved along the inside to the first turn, switched outside foes entering the backstretch, continued to make steady
progress advancing on the leaders three wide on the far turn, moved to gain the advantage in that path approaching midstretch but couldn't contain the
winner. IDAKA, forwardly placed racing just outside the pacesetter, prompted that rival racing into the far turn, angled inside foes entering the stretch
disputing the issue to the furlong marker but weakened late. ASTERS D'ORO, urged to the lead outside a rival racing to the first turn, maintained the
advantage into the far turn, dueled between foes into upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. TAMI'S ORCHID was settled last to the
backstretch along the inside, angled out racing into upper stretch but offered no rally. MISS GHISLAINE was settled off the inside racing to the backstretch
and failed to menace thereafter. CRYSTAL ORB tracked the leaders three deep in second flight racing to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch.
