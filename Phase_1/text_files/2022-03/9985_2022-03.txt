the inner rail around the turn, rallied inside horses. FLAVA'S DREAM , three deep leaving the turn, chased the winner throughout and weakened. ALYS
GREAT NOTION chased the pace, raced in the two path leaving the turn and gave way. SUNDAY SWAGGER , swung five wide turning for home, was not
a factor. SUZZETTE STAR , no factor, swung wide in upper stretch. CHARLIV , five wide entering the stretch, was outrun.

ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) rated forwardly while saving ground, took closer order after a half mile, got through along the rail to challenge in upper stretch,
dueled inside a pair of rivals while holding a slim advantage past mid stretch, wandered outward despite efforts with the right stick, dug in tenaciously and
prevailed. JUSTINTHENICKOTIME prompted the pace outside the leader, came under a ride leaving the far turn, was floated out to about the four path
entering the stretch when challenging for command, fought on outside rivals from there and finished gamely. NO BURN cleared early and set a rated pace
two wide, drifted out a bit when collared past the quarter pole, straightened and fought on between foes, kept on past the sixteenth marker then gave way
grudgingly. INK , off the pace while saving ground, came out in upper stretch but failed to rally. BUGLE OF WAR , in the clear and in range of rivals leaving
the half mile marker, came under pressure past the three eighths but failed to kick on. OUR LUCKY MAN ducked out badly leaving the gate nearly
unseating his rider, pulled up soon after and walked off. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start of OUR LUCKY MAN. No action was deemed
necessary.

SAMMIE SUNSHINE set a pressured pace slightly off the inner rail and prevailed in an extended drive. TWEET AWAY ROBIN , outside the winner
throughout, prompted that one in a game performance. MAVILUS , along the inner rail throughout, passed tired horses in the drive. NOTION
INTERRUPTUS , four deep leaving the turn, was never a factor. GALLINELLA raced in the two path around the turn and gave way in upper stretch.
BETCHA BY GOLLY raced in the three path on the turn and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ESCAPE FUND edged up four wide outside rivals nearing the half mile marker and joined the pace fray, sparred three deep under rating leaving the far turn,
shook clear without much asking past the five sixteenths, responded in upper stretch to spurt away then held firm while kept to task. TEQUILA FOG , close
up while saving ground early on, eased back off foes leaving the far turn, angled out mid turn and was put to a solid ride, swung about five wide in upper
stretch, straightened away and closed willingly to nab the place. HEATED broke a bit slow then accelerated between runners to take the early pace, vied
inside foes into the turn, eased back a bit to stalk, angled out and worked between foes to make a comeback in mid stretch, continued on with good effort
but was edged for second in the final yards. DEVILISH AFFAIR tracked three wide, moved out wider and ranged up into the lane, chased to mid stretch then
faded. AWESOME VIEW vied between runners early, shifted in around the turn to contest the pace, stayed on to the head of the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
EASTERN BAY , pinched back leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn stalking the pace under patient handling, eased out to the four path
approaching the stretch, secured command outside horses in upper stretch and drew away while kept to his business. SWING WEST stalked the pace while
three deep on the turn, was well positioned in upper stretch, raced on his left lead for much of the drive and lacked the necessary late response. W W
SPRINGTIME bore in on foes leaving the starting gate, sprinted to the early lead, set the pace in the two path around the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch
and gradually weakened. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU , along the inner rail chasing the pace to the stretch, gave way. THE GREAT DANSKY lacked speed,
raced in the three path on the turn and failed to menace. SPOTTED BULL , outrun, swung to the five path in upper stretch. AWESOME D J , forced in by W
W SPRINGTIME leaving the starting gate, trailed and swung six wide turning for home.

Footnotes
AWARD WANTED prompted the pace two wide outside the leader, moved in hand to draw alongside with a half mile remaining poked a head in front
leaving the far turn then cruised clear, widened the advantage into the lane, was put to some asking in mid stretch then continued as much the best while
kept alert. TONAL VISION , bumped at the break, was taken to rate two while while not too far back, worked between runners past the five sixteenths,
shifted out four wide with run into the lane, straightened and kept on with good energy to be clearly second best. OUR BELLA NICOLE , away in good order,
was rated back off the leaders heading to the first turn, saved ground while settled, came out out for the drive and churned on. POSITIVE POWER cleared
early and set the pace towards the rail, was joined nearing the half mile marker, ceded to the winner soon after, gave willing chase then drifted three wide
into the lane, corrected and stayed on with interest. TOSS A COIN , bumped at the break, edged up three wide between runners near the five eighths and
stalked, shifted five wide under pressure into the lane then faded. PETTIGO GIRL leaned in at the break and bumped with TOSS A COIN, was used four
wide outside rivals around the first turn, reached a stalking spot past the three quarter pole, was caught four wide into the far turn, fanned six wide into the
lane and gave way. GHOST MAIDEN rated forwardly while saving ground, had no response past the five sixteenths, weakened and was eased late.

GWYNEDD , taken to the outside of BESTLA approaching the five eighths pole, wrested the lead from that one leaving the turn, drew off and drifted out in
the drive under left hand urging. POLISH COOKIE saved ground on the turn, eased out turning for home and chased the winner through the stretch. I CAN
DO IT bumped STARTWITHABANG when coming in at the break, raced in the three path between horses in mid stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth pole
and flattened out. ISLAND PHILO circled rivals on the turn, was four deep turning for home and lacked a rally. STARTWITHABANG , bumped leaving the
starting gate, raced along the inner rail throughout and was not a factor. BESTLA showed speed, was taken to the inner rail entering the turn, remained
along the rail to the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BENEATH THE STARS sped clear after a furlong and was confidently handled, met an inside bid from BANDITS WARRIOR leaving the furlong marker then
ceded the lead while still under rating mid turn, dueled from there then retook the advantage after being put to firm asking in upper stretch, shook clear
inside the sixteenth marker and kept on with good energy to the wire. BANDITS WARRIOR broke on top despite a bobble, allowed the winner to clear off
early while taken to rate, came back along the rail to challenge three furlongs out, poked a head in front soon after, dueled past the eighth pole then gave
way grudgingly. FUHGEDDABOUDIT edged up three wide into the turn and took aim of a contested pace, was under pressure past the five sixteenths,
pursued on her left lead in upper stretch but came up empty. MURPH lagged back off the pace, saved ground into the lane and leveled off to a decent stride
through the final seventy yards. SWEET GRACIE rated off foes near the half mile marker, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths and faded.

Footnotes
BORRACHO set a pressured pace along the inner rail, opened up under confident handling in mid stretch then was under urging late. TREASURE TROVE
lacked speed, worked between horses in the stretch and rallied. BUSTOFF saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, swung to the four path turning for
home and flattened out. HONOR THE FLEET , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, was fanned five wide turning for home and weakened.
WHISKEY AND YOU prompted the pace outside the winner to mid stretch then weakened. MCCAIN saved ground around the turn and weakened. DIXIE
DRAWL , kept wide down the backstretch and around the turn, was eased late.
