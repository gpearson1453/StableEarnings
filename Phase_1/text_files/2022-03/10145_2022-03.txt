Footnotes
ALEXANDER'S DREAM tracked the fast fractions from a three wide path through the turn, advanced in upper stretch to confront KNOCKOUT BERT
nearing the furlong grounds, overtook that foe and kicked clear in the final stages. KNOCKOUT BERT was hustled from the break and set quick fractions
through the turn, came under pressure from the winner nearing the furlong grounds and ceded the lead but kept on in the final stages to hold for second.
AMERICA GREAT chased the pace from a three wide path on the turn, made a mild late gain in the drive to challenge for the place and just got the nod in
the end for the show. EVENEREVENWORSE stalked the quick pace through the turn, lost position in the final furlong and weakened in the late stages.
BARBIERE ducked in soon after the break and spotted the field in the early stages, chased from the rear through the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
ONCOMING was on a tight hold in the early going while just off of the pace, saved ground through the second turn, was given his cue in upper stretch,
overtook ROBIE inside of the furlong marker and pulled away in the late stages. SHE SHOT ME DOWN stalked the early pace outside of rivals, was steered
to the two path nearing the quarter-marker, was outkicked by the winner in the stretch run but kept on to secure the place. NICKEL NICKEL NINE stumbled
at the start and was allowed to settle in the early stages, mounted a four wide bid into the lane and passed tiring rivals in the late stages to claim the show.
ROBIE attended to the pace through the second turn, took command into the final furlong, was overtaken by the winner inside of the furlong marker and
gave way in the final stages. TALISKER BAY stalked the early pace, lost ground along the backstretch and into the far turn and weakened in the late going.
MEETMEATTHECLUB broke alertly and was sent to the front, set moderate fractions while being prompted through the second turn, lost the lead in upper
stretch and was empty in the late stages.

SIMPLY PERFECT stalked the pace outside of rivals, improved position nearing the quarter-marker, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, took
command into the final sixteenth, dug in and held in the end over the oncoming runner-up. STAND IN YOUR LOVE chased the pace three wide on the turn,
swung widest into the drive, made a good late rally in the final sixteenth but could not reel in the winner and held for second. WHAT UP NOW J T stalked
the early pace, was in tight leaving the quarter-marker and into upper stretch, was outkicked in the final sixteenth but got up to claim third. RUN LIKE KONA
broke alertly and set the contested pace through the quarter-marker, lost the lead inside of the furlong marker and was edged for the show in the final
strides. ELGOFRANCO disputed the pace from a three wide path to the quarter-marker, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages.
LOVELY HUSSAR saved ground while stalking the pace and weakened in the late stages. GARDEES WORLD was hustled leaving the break, lacked early
speed to the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BIG PAPA STEVE dueled with LITTLE CASINO for pace duties in the early going, was roused at the head of the lane, vied for the lead nearing the furlong
marker, took a narrow advantage over NORTHVALE ROAD into the final sixteenth and made a late push to hold the runner-up at bay in the end.
NORTHVALE ROAD pressed the pace three wide, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner in the closing stages
and was denied the win, while holding safely for the place. TRIP TO SPAIN brushed with MANAALABOUTDAMONEY leaving the five-eighths marker,
chased the pace two wide on the turn, was outkicked in the stretch run but held for third over an oncoming rival. MANAALABOUTDAMONEY brushed with
TRIP TO SPAIN leaving the five furlong marker, chased the pace three wide through the turn, closed in the drive and just missed for the show. LITTLE
CASINO broke alertly and was engaged by BIG PAPA STEVE soon after the break to duel on the front end through the turn, lost position in upper stretch
and weakened in the final stages. DIMMI QUANDO was a bit slow into stride in the early stages, chased the pace outside of rivals on the turn and gave way
in the late going.

Footnotes
SLOANE GARDEN (GB) tracked the pacesetter through the first half-mile, closed the gap on JOYMAKER nearing the quarter-marker, took command into
the drive and drew clear in the final stages. BUYBACK saved all of the ground while stalking the pace, mounted an inside bid in upper stretch, was
outkicked by the winner but got up in the final stages to secure second. SCHERZO (GB) settled just off of the early pace, steadied a bit leaving the
six-furlong marker, gained ground leaving the far turn but was outfinished in the drive and just missed for the place. GETTIN SIDEWAYS stalked the early
pace, improved position while three wide on the second turn but lacked a final kick in the stretch run. JOYMAKER broke a bit awkwardly and was sent to the
front to set prompted fractions, was overtaken by the winner leaving the far turn and gave way in the late stages. REIWA was allowed to settle in the early
going while saving ground and did not mount a late rally.

Footnotes
ROYAL 'N RANDO was floated five wide along the first turn, took back into the backstretch run while maintaining a wide trip, gained ground on the far turn
while four wide, confronted BROOKYS TAPIT in upper stretch, dueled with that rival into the final stages and dug in late to prevail. BROOKYS TAPIT
prompted the pace through the half-mile marker, overtook MALIBU GHOST leaving the far turn, was headed by ROYAL 'N RANDO nearing the furlong
marker, dueled with that rival into the final stages and was worn down in the end while well clear of the rest for second. UNUSUAL CODE stalked the pace
from the midflight while not far off of the rail, was outkicked by the top pair in the stretch but kept on in the end to hold for the show. KEEP ON DANZING
was four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace through the second turn, lost ground three wide nearing the quarter-marker and gave way in the final
stages. WILL IS CHILL was a bit rank and hard to place in the early going and floated ROYAL 'N RANDO out five wide on the first turn, settled in the run
along the backstretch, trailed into the far turn and lacked a late rally in the drive. MALIBU GHOST was sent after breaking alertly and set contested fractions
through the second turn, was overtaken by BROOKYS TAPIT in upper stretch and tired in the late stages. AWESOME CURLIN saved ground while stalking
the early pace, lost ground into the second turn and gave out in the final stages.

Footnotes
VINCERO GRANDE was forwardly placed while prompting the modest fractions through the first half-mile, closed on the pacesetter nearing the
quarter-marker, took command into the stretch run, showed some greenness while on the left lead in the late stages but pulled away in the end. VRONSKY
FEINT stalked the pace from a two wide path between rivals, was asked for run nearing the quarter-marker, was outkicked by the winner in the drive but
held for second over an oncoming rival. ALESHA settled just off of the early pace, took back while saving ground into the second turn, mounted a two wide
bid into the drive and closed in the late stages to get up for the show. LADY'S SERMON was forwardly placed in the early going while saving ground, lost
position on the second turn and weakened in the stretch drive. DASHING DEMI was three wide on the first turn while just off of the pace, advanced along
the backstretch run to stalk the pace into the second turn, lost ground three wide on the far turn and gave way in the late stages. ALISO BEACH settled off
of the pace, was steered three wide into the far turn and was not a factor. DRESS REHEARSAL broke alertly and was sent to the front, set contested
fractions into the second turn, was overtaken by VINCERO GRANDE leaving the quarter-marker and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
HARBOR KITTY overtook ZERO BUCKS GIVEN on the run into the turn and sped to a clear lead, extended the lead along the bend, was kept to task in the
final stages and was ridden out in the end. OUR EXPECTATION saved ground while chasing the pace from the second flight, angled out in upper stretch,
closed well in the final stages and was best of the rest. ZERO BUCKS GIVEN broke alertly and was sent in the early stages, was overtaken by HARBOR
KITTY on the run into the turn, chased that rival along the turn while two wide and was outkicked in the drive, but held safely for the show. MINOSO saved
ground while chasing the pace from the midflight, advanced into the stretch run but did not offer a final bid in the drive. CAJUN BETTOR lacked early speed
while running along the inside, was steered widest for the drive and showed late interest in the final sixteenth. EROTIC chased the fast pace outside of foes
on the turn and did not mount a late rally. ARNO'S MANE MAN lacked early speed while trailing into the turn and was not a factor. POTENTE ALBA chased
the early pace, lost ground along the turn two wide and tired in the late stages.
