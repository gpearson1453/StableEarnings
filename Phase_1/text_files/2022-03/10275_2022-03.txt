Footnotes
ESTILO VARONIL ducked inwards at the start, was righted, then angled to the inside prompting the pace through the backstretch, was urged to press the
issue nearing upper stretch, edged clear entering the lane and just held CAPTAIN at the wire under brisk handling. The latter, caught in tight quarters at the
start, tracked off the first flight between foes while under some prompting racing through the backstretch, shifted out four wide on the turn making a steady
advance to contention, moved to reel in the pacesetter through the last furlong and just missed. IFEELGOOD was urged three deep prompting the pace in
early stages, pressed the issue to upper stretch and gave way. MIAMI CHROME tracked off the first flight along the inside and faded into upper stretch.
SHINBORO shied inwards avoiding the eventual winner at the start while crossing into the path of CAPTAIN, was collected to race behind the second flight
to the turn, was fanned five wide in the closing stages but offered no rally. RIP IT RYAN was outpaced early and failed to menace. LIL BULL angled inwards
while being urged between foes pressing the pace into the turn, then gave way abruptly in the drive.

Footnotes
STYNER broke sharply, sprinted clear racing a bit off the rail into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin a bit off the rail through the backstretch,
edged away to a clear advantage nearing upper stretch, drifted out racing through the stretch into the path of TAPSASIONAL but held that foe in an all out
drive. The latter stalked just off the pacesetter three wide into the backstretch, made a steady advance in that path to challenge nearing midstretch, was
carried out in the closing stages but contested the issue grudgingly to the end to just miss. MUNQAD angled to the inside racing to the backstretch tracking
just off the pacesetter, moved to prompt that rival along the rail after a half, continued along the inside to upper stretch and faded in the drive. CURLIN'S
THRILL settled last in early stages, switched out four wide racing into the far turn, was prompted to advance in that path to upper stretch but lacked the
needed late kick. DREAM KEEPER switched out racing to the backstretch to track off the second flight outside a rival in the three path to the far turn and
faded into the stretch. TAKE A CHANCE angled inwards early tracking behind the second flight in the opening half, was urged to make a brief bid between
foes on the far turn but came up empty racing into the lane. VICARAGE was settled along the inside racing to the first turn, switched out while dropping out
last on the backstretch and never proved a threat.

Footnotes
QUEEN'S BEST tracked just off the first flight four wide in the opening stages, made a steady advance in that path through the turn to challenge for
command midstretch and edged forward to prevail under pressure. FLOR DE PLATA settled outside foes avoiding some traffic after the break, gradually
drew into contention six wide nearing upper stretch, came around traffic approaching midstretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner while
edging a rival for the place honors. CATCH THE RAINBOW raced just off the leaders between foes in the opening furlong, responded when prompted with a
sharp move to gain terms with the pacesetter three deep nearing the bend, pressed the issue outside that foe through the turn to midstretch, continued to
dispute the issue inside the winner to late stages but weakened nearing the wire. NY BETH GETSITDONE broke sharply, angled inwards to force the pace
outside a rival in the opening furlong, dueled for command a bit off the rail into upper stretch and yielded leaving the furlong marker. WINNING MANDATE
tracked off the first flight five wide on the backstretch, continued four wide between foes on the turn, was carried out by THE JOKES ON ME into the paths
of TAP SOLO and FLOR DE PLATA nearing midstretch and had no final response. TAP SOLO shied a bit at the start, settled off the second flight outside
foes on the backstretch, was prompted to advance five wide on the turn to upper stretch, then was carried out nearing midstretch while giving way. THE
JOKES ON ME shied inwards at the start, was quickly righted, then urged along the rail to prompt the pacesetter into the turn, lost terms with the leaders
entering the bend, then drifted out racing into upper stretch crossing into the paths of several rivals while giving way. TETON THAI ducked inwards at the
start, angled to the rail tracking off the second flight racing into the turn and offered no rally. AWESOME WINNA was jostled at the start, settled between
foes and never menaced thereafter. CRYSTAL STEPS flashed brief pace inside foes in the opening stages but gave way early. GEE GEE'S CURLIN
ducked out at the start while being steadied a bit and never gained contention. LA MAGNOLIA came under pressure while angling to the inside early and
soon dropped out.

Footnotes
FLUID SITUATION broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, shook clear racing into upper
stretch and made the balance of the pace in a ridden out effort. ANARCHIST broke readily, tipped to the two path tracking the pacesetter inside foes in the
second flight through the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the leader racing into the bend, tipped out nearing midstretch but couldn't close the gap
on that foe while proving clearly best of the others. CAMINERO was rated off the second flight between foes racing through the backstretch, was urged to
split foes racing into upper stretch and continued well enough to gain a share. REMUDA tracked off the second flight inside foes in the opening half, saved
ground through the turn to upper stretch but had no closing bid. KENRIC tracked the the pace three deep behind the second flight racing to the turn and
never gained contention. MOMENT OF PEACE, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter through the backstretch, gave way after a half. BANCO
MEDICI was urged four wide on the backstretch prompting the pacesetter in the opening three furlongs, then gave way into the turn. FLASHFIRE was never
a factor.

Footnotes
MACKILLOP angled to the inside in early stages tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch while under light reserve,
saved ground through the far turn, tipped out racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to wrest command and go clear under pressure.
THEREGOESMYMIRACLE sped to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, held
sway into upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. I AM THE LAW angled inwards to track behind the second flight between foes
racing to the backstretch and continued with a steady effort inside rivals in the closing stages to gain position while earning a share. BILL NEEDLE, off a
step slow, was reserved well off the second flight to the backstretch, switched outside foes nearing the far turn, made solid progress on the second bend to
loom four wide nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. LET MY PEOPLE GO, forwardly placed between rivals prompting the pace to the far turn,
faded between foes into the lane. BERNIE LOMAX, off a bit slowly, pulled his way to contention three wide racing to the first turn, continued in that path to
the second bend and gave way nearing the lane. OSABA trailed throughout.

Footnotes
KING CAB showed quickly in front, shifted to the inside dictating the pace on a clear advantage through the backstretch, widened that margin racing into the
turn, then held sway to the end under firm right handed encouragement. LIGHTENING LARRY tracked the pacesetter between foes leading the second
flight on a narrow margin into the turn, couldn't gain terms with the winner in the drive but held a rival for the place honors. CATTIN was settled off the
second flight while shifting out four wide racing to the turn, was prompted to advance while angling to the rail racing into upper stretch but was outkicked for
second. DEAN DELIVERS tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight in early stages, tipped off the inside racing into the bend and
faded between foes racing into the stretch. MORGAN POINT was outpaced early and proved no threat. STORMY PATTERN tracked the pacesetter three
wide in early stages and gave way between foes racing into the turn.

Footnotes
TREASURE KING was settled off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out racing into the far turn gathering momentum, made a
steady advance three wide into upper stretch, then continued with solid late momentum to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling.
TAPTHESPEEDOFSOUND was urged to the lead outside foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail once gaining a clear advantage, dictated the pace
on a comfortable margin into the far turn, shifted out while being roused to resist the winner's bid leaving midstretch but couldn't contain that rival late.
MERLIN tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside in the opening half, tipped to the two path nearing the far turn while being urged to close the gap on
that foe, then continued with a steady effort between foes into the stretch to edge a rival for a share while failing to match the top pair. C MY MEISTER was
rated off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, split foes after a half while being prompted to advance, angled to the rail nearing the far
turn, saved ground to upper stretch, then was urged to bid inside the pacesetter nearing the furlong marker but flattened out in the closing stages.
SKIPPERINI tracked off the second flight inside foes and faded after a half. MR RUM RUNNER tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in early stages,
continued three deep after a half and gave way racing into the far turn. FAST PAYDAY trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT STROLL broke sharply, angled to the inside racing through the chute to dictate the pace on a narrow margin on the backstretch, widened the
advantage racing into the bend, shifted out while being roused to maintain a clear advantage midstretch and held sway to the end under pressure.
RAPTUROUS tracked off the second flight outside foes on the backstretch, was prompted to advance advance three wide into the turn, moved to challenge
for command in that path in upper stretch but proved only second best. OUTFOXED was off slowly, switched out sharply to race five wide in the opening
quarter, was prompted to gain position in the four path nearing upper stretch, shifted inwards under pressure entering the lane and lacked the needed final
bid while prevailing for a share. SWEET LAURA tracked the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing
the lane. KAEKO angled inwards to track just off the second flight between foes racing to the turn but lacked a closing response. KILLARGUE'S GIRL, held
up avoiding traffic leaving the chute, dropped out of contention early. HOT PEPPERS shied a bit while altering her course outside the pacesetter racing
through the chute, tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the turn and gave way after a half.

DRAMA CHORUS broke readily, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage into the first turn, briefly widened the margin after a half on
his own courage, met a rival's challenge leaving the midway point of the far turn, was roused to kick away from MAX K. O. racing into upper stretch and held
that foe gamely to the end under firm left handed encouragement. The latter gained a forward placing along the inside while being rated just off the
pacesetter into the first turn, continued under patient handling saving ground on the second bend, tipped out entering upper stretch while being roused to
challenge for command, loomed outside the winner leaving the furlong marker but was outkicked. LURE HIM IN tracked off the second flight between foes in
the opening stages, angled to the inside entering the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and continued with interest along the inside to improve
position while prevailing for a share. SHAMROCKET settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn to advance four wide, then five
wide into upper stretch and continued to gain position to the end while making no real impression. FREEDOM MATTERS tracked off the second flight
outside foes in the opening half, tipped three wide while being urged to advance between foes nearing upper stretch but had no final kick. AND WON settled
near the inside in the opening half, swung out four wide racing into the lane but proved no threat. CHESS'S DREAM was rated off the second flight along
the inside to the backstretch but never gained contention. OVER THE CHANNEL angled inwards to track just off the pacesetter outside a rival in the
opening half, was urged to lodge a brief bid racing into the far turn but quickly emptied out nearing upper stretch. FAST FIRE proved no factor.

Footnotes
SHIFTY SHE broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the backstretch, extended the advantage midway through the far turn
and held sway through the lane under firm encouragement. OUR FLASH DRIVE was rated off the second flight along the inside to the far turn, angled out
three wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, couldn't close the gap on the winner but edged a rival for the place honors late. MONA
STELLA tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out racing into upper stretch while being prompted in pursuit of the
leader and was outkicked for second. LOVELY LUVY settled between foes in the last flight early, switched outside foes while being prompted to advance,
swung five wide in upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. MIA MARTINA settled outside foes in early stages and continued evenly
between rivals into the stretch. CHICK'S SHADOW settled along the inside in the opening half and failed to mount a serious challenge. ONYX settled last in
early stages and never gained contention. EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE, forwardly placed outside a rival tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch,
steadily faded racing through the far turn. SIP'N DIP tracked off the second flight outside foes and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
PUDDING broke readily, attended the pace three wide racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue in that path entering the turn to gain the
advantage, dueled inside a rival in the three path while being headed momentarily in upper stretch but continued resolutely to prevail under firm handling.
TAP IT TO WIN was rated outside foes tracking off the first flight on the backstretch, steadily advanced on the eventual winner four wide through the turn to
upper stretch to strike the front nearing midstretch, then contested the issue with a grudging effort to the end but was just outfinished. CAJUN CASANOVA
was settled last while shifting off the inside racing through the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued well enough to edge
a rival for a share. OFFICIATING angled inwards to track just off the first flight between foes racing into the turn, switched out four wide in upper stretch,
then angled inwards under pressure in the closing stages while weakening. REAL TALK, forwardly placed along the rail attending the pace through the
backstretch, steadily faded racing into the turn. IT'S MY HOUSE broke readily, was urged between foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing
through the backstretch, lost the advantage racing into the turn and gave way after a half.

LHEEAS JOY was settled between foes in the opening stages, switched out on the backstretch, steadily advanced on the leaders four wide racing into the
far turn, moved to wrest command in that path leaving the midway point of the bend, shifted inside once gaining a clear advantage and held sway on a
widening margin under firm left handed pressure. GOLD WATCH, reserved along the inside while racing last to the backstretch, switched outside foes to
advance five wide racing through the far turn, then continued with a steady effort four wide into the stretch to edge a rival for the place honors late. LAZARA
settled into stride outside a rival racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced to contention four wide between foes on the far turn, couldn't close the gap on
the winner entering the stretch and was outkicked for second. REQUESTFORPROPOSAL tracked off the first flight between foes in early stages, angled to
the inside entering the far turn, awaited an opening while caught behind tiring foes nearing the lane, tipped out entering the stretch but had no rally.
CRACKIN MISCHIEF ducked out at the start, settled into stride off the inside while dropping out last nearing the far turn and passed only tiring rivals.
LOTTA ROSES, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset, dueled for command into the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. SUMMER
BELLE tracked off the first flight inside foes racing to the backstretch and steadily faded after a half. CROSS FLEET joined the pace three wide racing to the
