Footnotes
SUPERTRIX set the pace inside of a vying rival while a path off of the rail around the first turn, tucked in entering the backstretch, showed the way from a
pair of rivals into the far turn, got briefly headed by his immediate outer counterpart turning for home, but regained an advantage in upper stretch, then
inched clear at the furlong grounds. APHRODITES REVENGE pressed the leading pair from the outside while in the four path around the first turn, took the
far turn in the three path, then failed to bid in upper stretch before being outpaced by the inner leader approaching the furlong grounds, and kept on to prove
second best. TABLE ONE trailed, floated from the two to three path around the far turn, shifted inwardly at the three sixteenths pole, and sustained a rail
rally to gain show at the sixteenth pole. LETS GO ALL THEWAY vied for the lead two wide while in the three path around the first turn, then in the two path
into the far turn as an outer rival ranged up, forged a narrow advantage at the five sixteenths pole, but relinquished the lead in upper stretch before
weakening approaching the final furlong. BABY MAYBE hopped at the start, tracked in the two path before shifting outside of the leading trio entering the
backstretch, then took the far turn in the five path before tiring through the lane. STACEYS RACEY stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading
trio in upper stretch, but lacked the needed kick and tired.

Footnotes
SPECIAL CONNECTION broke a beat slowly, settled off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, commenced a rally in the four path into the far
turn, bid outside of the leading pair at the five sixteenths pole, dueled through upper stretch as an inner GIGABLAST dug in, and prevailed in the final
sixteenth. GIGABLAST prompted the leader from the three path, led in the two path into the far turn after her inner counterpart faltered, met
SPELLBINDINGS's bid before SPECIAL CONNECTION issued a challenge at the five sixteenths pole, dueled with the latter through upper stretch, but was
bested in the late stages. STORIED TRIP stalked inside of a rival while a path off of the rail, came into the far turn two wide as the early pace-setter tired,
tipped four wide and outside of the leading trio at the quarter pole, then grinded away at the dueling pair through the final furlong, but did not have enough to
reach them. THEBOYZGALAXY set the pace inside of a pressing foe, gave way to that rival into the far turn, faltered around that bend, but passed outer
tiring rivals in the final sixteenth to reclaim a minor share. SPELLBINDING bobbled a bit at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to three
wide around the far turn before fanning five wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid before tiring. MILA'S GOLD tracked three wide while in the four path
around the first turn, engaged the leader from the three path into the far turn, bid at the five sixteenths pole as an outer rival menaced, but yielded between
rivals passing the quarter pole. MY LITTLE JEN stalked two wide while in the three path around the first turn, then weakened between horses into the far
turn. LIL ASHLEY B. broke slowly and was outrun.

OURQUICKDRAWMCGRAW bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace two wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, dueled after gaining a
narrow advantage at the quarter pole, and drew clear in the final sixteenth. CORN SOUP set the pace inside of a prompting OURQUICKDRAWMCGRAW,
dueled with that rival turning for home, fought on after getting headed at the quarter pole, but gave way entering the final sixteenth, and lasted for place to
the wire. JOHNNY BOOTLEGGS chased along the inside before shifting to the three path and outside of the leading pair entering the turn, took aim on them
entering the lane with multiple lengths to find, but hung on his left lead, drifted outwardly from left handed pressure at the furlong grounds, then lugged back
inwardly from right handed urging approaching the final sixteenth, then kept on in the late stages, but missed reaching a tiring rival for place. HALF A
DOODLE broke a step slowly, moved up after a furlong to an inside tracking position, but checked mildly and lost position when an outer NICE STAR put
him to tight quarters at the three furlong pole, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and stayed on late to gain a minor share. ROCK STAR ALEX broke a
beat slowly while last away from the gates, then saved ground around the turn while trailing, and moved up along the rail through the lane. NICE STAR
tracked from midpack two wide, shifted to the rail while clearing an inner foe passing the three furlong pole, then moved to the four path while chasing and
hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, and tired. KAHAAL bumped with an outer rival at the start, then altered course outside of foes at the five furlong
pole, did so off a rivals heels, moved forward to track in the four path into the turn, ranged up to the leading pair turning for home, but drifted to the six path
while faltering and hanging on his left lead in upper stretch. HARD KINGS raced far back in the four to five path around the turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
CLARA BELLE set the pace in the two path, showed the way from a pair of chasing rivals while well in hand around the far turn, then drew off under driving
pressure in upper stretch. EARLEY ROSE pressed the pace from the four to three path around the first turn, then chased the leader while under urging
around the far turn, battled outside of LADY MAEVE (IRE) for place through the lane, and prevailed late. LADY MAEVE (IRE) stalked inside of rivals while
tucking from the two path to the rail around the first turn, then chased the well-traveling leader around the far turn, dueled for place with an outer rival
through the lane, but was bested in the final sixteenth. MISS TONALIST tracked along the inside, took the far turn in the three to four path, then wandered
about through the lane while tiring. SURREY tracked in the three to two path and between horses around the first turn, rated back and shifted tot he four
path in the early part of the backstretch, but tired in the five path around the far turn. UNION GRAD broke a step slowly, then showed little.

Footnotes
AIN'T BROKE set a clear pace, held sway from an outer chasing CATWINGS through midstretch, and lasted as that foe closed in late. CATWINGS stalked
outside of the clear leader, took aim while shifting to the four path in upper stretch, failed to progress entering the final furlong, but gained as the leader tired
in the closing stages, attempted a late bid, but did not have enough to reel that foe in. SUPER CHRISTIE tracked in the three path, shifted to the five path
while failing to keep pace with the top air, then held place from an inner rival through the final furlong. COCOA COLADA bumped the gate while breaking
slowly, laid off of the pace along the inside, then moved up between horses approaching midstretch, but failed to reach an outer rival for show. CHOPIN
DRIVE tracked along the inside, but tired through the lane. LOVE OF MY LIFE failed to factor. JOY ENAMORADA never got involved.

AIR GUITAR STAR tracked along the inside, moved forward to a stalking position entering the backstretch, inherited an advantage into the far turn after the
leader bore out, showed the way from a pressing SAVVY SHIPMAN around that bend, repelled that foe's bid passing the quarter pole, inched clear in upper
stretch, and held sway. MI LIA raced forwardly placed while shifting off of the rail and to the three path around the first turn to be outside of the clear leader,
but checked mildly when that foe bore across his path into the far turn, tucked to the rail shortly after, then chased along it around that bend and through
upper stretch, claimed place while shifting ground outwardly in the final furlong, and stayed on to cut the leader's margin late. G'S DEADLINE broke a bit
outwardly at the start, tracked three wide, ranged up to the leading pair turning for home, but leveled off while failing to keep pace in upper stretch. SAVVY
SHIPMAN settled off of the pace along the inside, improved inside of rivals into the far turn to press the leader from the outside around that bend, bid turning
for home, but was repelled leaving the quarter pole, then tired between horses in midstretch. APRIORITY LADY broke a bit outwardly, recovered to set a
clear pace in the three to two path around the first turn, but bore out to the five path into the far turn, was taken well in hand while being surpassed by inner
rivals in the process, then was eased turning for home, and walked off. HOTMOLLY laid off of the pace two wide, but eased in the early part of the
backstretch, pulled up entering the lane, then was vanned off.

home well, but was kept at bay. HOIST THE GOLD stalked along the inside, altered course four wide at the three sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace in
the process, then kept on to reach show in the late stages. HIGHER STANDARD stalked the clear leader from the outside while not providing early
pressure, then was outkicked by an outer bidding foe entering the lane, and tired approaching midstrech. BLUE KENTUCKY trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BIG LAKE stalked three wide, inched closer to press down the backstretch, vied outside of SPEITFUL SAM while a path away from him around the far turn,
then dueled with that foe through upper stretch, forged an advantage at the furlong grounds, and edged clear. SPEITFUL SAM set the pace along the
inside, met BIG LAKE's challenge around the far turn, shifted out to sustain a battle with that rival in upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong grounds,
and gave way late. CONTINENTAL COINS took a bump from an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside, and chased the top pair through the lane
while managing show. LAFITTE'S FLEET rated at the rear in the four to five paths around the turns, and moved up through the lane without threatening.
SUPER COMET laid off of the pace along the inside, then in the three path around the far turn, and failed to factor. MR. HUSTLE leaned in and bumped a
foe at the start, tracked two wide, tipped to the four path to stalk outside of the leading pair into the far turn, but failed to keep pace with them in upper
stretch, then wandered about at the furlong grounds before tiring between horses. SNOW HOUSE pressed the pace two wide, but weakened between
horses at the half mile pole.

Footnotes
BODE'S CONNECTION took a solid bump from an outer rival at the start, rated far back along the inside, rallied between horses in the two path around the
far turn to overhaul the leader in upper stretch, and drove clear soon after. AMERICAN FIRST bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace, showed
the way in the two path around the far turn, but offered little resistance for BODE'S CONNECTION's bid in upper stretch, and was second best. WORLD OF
HURT tracked in midpack, chased in the four path around the far turn, and was best of the rest. PAT HAND GIRL hopped slightly while off a step slowly,
trailed the field, took the far turn in the four path, and moved up. T R'S FIRST broke outwardly, laid off of the pace in the four to three path, and failed to
factor. THETHRILLERSGONE raced off of the pace in the three to two path and made little impact. I'M A CUSTOM TO IT bumped with an inner foe at the
start, stalked two wide and between horses, chased the clear leader from the three path around the far turn, but weakened approaching midstretch. STOP
SHOP N DROP leaned inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, stalked along the inside and faded around the far turn. MEMPHIS MELTDOWN stalked
three wide, but wilted at the five furlong pole, and was eased thereafter.
