Footnotes
ZOMBIE ALAN chased from outside going four wide on the turn, shifted inside the drifting leader turning for home, bid between runners, edged clear late. P
R RADIO STAR chased from inside, was game for the place spot over LT. BULLITT, who quickly moved clear and set the tempo racing off the rail, drifted
out leaving the turn, fought on in the stretch but was outfinished. HARROVIAN broke just a half-step slowly, advanced inside up the backstretch, shifted out
early on the turn, went three to four wide on that bend, had no rally in the stretch. JEN LORS LEGACY chased the pacesetter from between runners early,
dropped back leaving the backstretch, went four to five wide on the turn and had no rally. SUPER ACCORD failed to threaten after racing off the inside
through the turn. MARDEN was outrun early, pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
INDY'S STAR was in front early but ceded the lead to an intent rival to track from inside, tipped out early up the backstretch, moved three wide between
runners into the far turn taking the lead later on that bend, was asked at the top of the stretch and responded to draw clear. GYPSY LYNN settled toward the
back outside a foe, advanced between runners late up the backstretch still racing two to three wide, loomed a minor threat but was no match for the winner
while clearly second best. PRINCESS OF MALIBU stalked four wide early, applied pressure up the backstretch, lost ground turning for home, secured show
honors while no match for the top pair. BIG HEAT switched out early on the first turn while mid-pack racing two to three wide, moved near the rail about the
half, took slightly closer order on the far turn racing two wide but failed to rally in the stretch. WUMPMUG veered in a bit early while keen to take the lead,
set the tempo in the two path, came up empty. NIGHT MIST stalked four to five wide early, dropped back on the far turn, faded. BIG FASHION shifted in
early, was ridden along at the half, offered no response while losing ground, was eased through the lane, crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
SMILING SPIRIT was hard to load, tracked the leaders two to three wide into the turn, swung eight deep coming out of that bend, took aim and drove past.
HOLY TUTTA BELLA was urged forward to duel inside a runner early, edged clear early on the turn racing off the rail, drifted five wide turning for home, was
no match for the winner but fought gamely to hold the place. RED BOTTOM REBEL settled off the leaders, went four wide on the turn, came into upper
stretch seven wide, found her best stride late to get up for show honors while narrowly missing second. HINDU MISS CHEF bumped a rival at the start but
quickly recovered under some coaxing to take the early lead, was then pressured from an inside rival dueling briefly, continued to chase three wide into the
turn, was carried out several paths by the leader turning for home, was outfinished for the major awards. SHIP'S CREEK settled outside runners early, was
forced four to five wide on the turn racing toward the rear, came out in upper stretch and gained mildly. MONGOLIAN ROSE bobbled just slightly at the start,
went three to four wide on the turn, was not a threat. GONE QUICK broke a step slowly and was bumped at the start, lacked early speed, went three to four
wide on the turn and failed to rally. A THOUSAND DREAMS was off slow and tossed her head at the start, saved ground to no avail. BLACK DROP tracked
up close from inside, came out once in upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
DAFFODIL SWEET exchanged a light bump at the break but recovered quickly to achieve forward position inside, moved to the lead turning for home,
drifted out a bit in late stretch but held under steady handling. COPPER CHARM exchanged a light bump at the start, settled inside, came out a path late on
the turn, angled inside the leader once in upper stretch to make an inside bid but couldn't get past. HARKING was forwardly-placed early, chased five wide
through the turn, kept on in the lane to get show honors over FIVE PICS PLEASE, who broke alertly and set the early tempo racing well off the fence,
pursued the winner from the four path on the turn, angled in and lost the whip in mid-stretch and was outfinished. MINE ME exchanged a very light brush at
the start, tracked in behind the leaders two to four wide through the turn, came out six wide turning for home, failed to rally. WITH THATBEINGSAID lacked
early speed despite some moderate encouragement, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to rally. FULL OF GRACE raced outside going five to six
wide, failed to make a bid. ZAMARA exchanged a very light brush at the start, went three to five wide on the turn and was not a threat.

UNSOLVED MYSTERY set the pace racing off the rail, faced some pressure up the backstretch, drifted out four deep leaving the far turn then drifted in
through late stretch but held sway. CHESTERETTE bumped a rival then was in turn bumped at the start, angled to the rail entering the first turn then came
out leaving that bend, edged closer under a hold stalking the leading pair from outside, was forced five to six wide on the far turn, loomed a threat but was
held at bay. MADIHA was bumped at the start, pursued the leader four wide applying more pressure up the backstretch, floated five wide into the stretch,
lost ground and angled in but had no late kick. MISSCZECH raced mid-pack outside going mostly four to five wide, ran on evenly. ROPERS N
WRANGLERS failed to rally after going two to three wide on the turns. TEMPORARILY switched out entering the first turn, raced toward the back and did
not threaten. OPAL CREEK was bumped into a foe then back into another rival at the start, went about three wide on the turns while racing toward the rear
and failed to threaten. RUNNINGONTHETAFUEL was not a factor after going four wide on the turns.

CHROME KING switched off the rail early on the first turn, settled off the leaders, moved out further coming past the five-sixteenths, came into upper stretch
seven wide, took aim and drove past late. FINNEUS bumped with a rival and was in tight at the start, moved out from three to five wide early, settled outside
stalking the leaders, advanced outside five wide late on the far turn coming into the stretch six deep, took the lead just outside the furlong marker, was
outfinished. MASHHAD FLATS set the pace racing off the rail in about the three path, continued well off the rail on the far turn drifting out a bit and was
overtaken in upper stretch, gradually weakened. MONGOLIAN MEMORY stalked four to five wide, advanced outside rivals early on the far turn, made a bid
for the lead about the five-sixteenths but could not sustain the effort. PHOENICIAN GHOST stalked the leader four deep, was in contention between runners
early on the far turn, weakened. CREME DE LA CHROME stumbled and was bumped at the start, tracked inside, dropped back and was getting out on the
far turn, was eased through the stretch, walked off. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION OPENING QUARTER-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
TIGER DAD attended the pace from outside going six then eight wide on the turn, kicked on to take the lead a sixteenth from the wire and held. BEDROCK
shifted in soon after the start content to trail the field, angled out coming to the quarter pole, was six wide at the head of the stretch then moved out eight
deep for room, belatedly rallied and ran out of ground. DARNQUICK was urged at the break but lacking early speed, raced well outside going from six to
nine wide on the turn, kept on to get up for show honors. RACE HOME lacked early speed despite early encouragement, went three to four wide on the turn,
found room between runners in mid-stretch to reach contention but was outkicked. MINISTER OF SOUL vied three to four wide between runners, led briefly
late on the turn but offered no extra for the drive. MR PAYTIENCE chased inside just off the rail, made an inside bid after saving ground to gain a brief and
narrow lead near the furlong marker but lacked the needed late kick. LAW ABIDIN CITIZEN contended between runners five to six wide, asked to keep pace
about the five-sixteenths but came up empty. ANNIE'S BOY set a pressured pace racing off the rail two to three deep, gave way. TAPPED TO THE MAX
contended four wide between runners, began to weaken at the three-eighths and continued to retreat.

Footnotes
MUCHO DEL ORO set the early tempo from just off the fence, dueled up the backstretch, was challenged on the far turn and through the lane, drifted out a
bit and lightly brushed a rival but dug in to get the nod over. MY INDY , who pressed the winner from outside going three wide through both turns, kept on
gamely despite being lightly brushed in mid-stretch and just missed. MAJESTIC EAGLE was bumped lightly into the first turn while three wide on that bend,
encouraged along on the far turn still traveling three deep, came out five wide in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. GIANT PAYDAY bumped a
rival lightly entering the first turn, tracked from inside, had room up the rail in the stretch but could not kick on with the top ones. CAMINO DEL PARAISO
raced four wide on the first turn, made a solid move three furlongs from home to make a mild bid but could not sustain the effort. BLACK OPS was outside
at the rear early, went mostly three to five wide through both turns, made no bids. ZUMURUDEE was bumped into a rival lightly early on the first turn then
eased back off the leaders, continued two wide on the far turn before coming out a bit turning for home, failed to rally.
