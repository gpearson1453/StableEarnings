Footnotes
GOLDEN INDY sped to the lead soon after the start and held clear around the first turn, set a pressured pace over looming outside duo up the backstretch,
repelled challengers around the far turn, responded under pressure and widened to a clear advantage in upper stretch then kept to task under a mild drive.
SHIMMERING LIGHT was forwardly placed inside around the first turn, applied pace pressure to GOLDEN INDY up the backstretch, launched a bid for
command entering the far turn, raced in close contention but could not reach the eventual winner, sustained steady response through the lane and cleared
second best. BYE BYE DAVID hopped slightly at the start and raced up close around the first turn, prompted the pace outside up the backstretch, came
under a drive three wide around the far turn, ran on through the lane and cleared the rest. WHERE'S VAL raced off the clear top trio through early stages,
was ridden along near the inside into the lane and lacked a needed rally. GUS K was unhurried and saved ground through early stages, was ridden along
three wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. CONGRATS AGAIN raced off the early pace, hustled along two wide into the stretch run and failed
to move into contention. DEN STREET raced off the pace three to four wide, had no response when called upon and steadily faded in the lane.

WHERE'S JOEY set the pace along the rail and drew off while ridden out. EMICRACK (CHI) chased the pace inside, angled out in upper stretch and ran on
to be clearly second best. WHISKEY SUNRISE prompted the winner two wide, could not keep pace nearing the quarter pole and weakened through the
lane. NOBLE EMPIRE saved ground off the early pace, angled three wide early on the turn and never threatened. FREE FLAYME broke sharply, could not
keep pace down the backstretch and continued to retreat two wide around the turn.

Footnotes
CHANCEUX cleared to the early lead inside, rated along for six furlongs, drifted out a few paths roused approaching the top of the stretch, kicked away
again, swapped back to his left lead entering the final furlong and remained in command. MANNIX (IRE) was briefly in tight between horses heading into the
first turn, advanced after six furlongs shifting out four wide, and finished with good courage to go clear for the place. MIDNIGHT CHROME broke slowly,
saved ground outrun to the stretch, and rallied mildly on the rail. HIGH STOCK prompted CHANCEUX from outside for six furlongs, and weakened through
the stretch. ROCKET ONE broke a step slow, and was no factor through a four-wide trip. SEIGNEUR was rank under restraint approaching the first turn,
settled down inside, and was empty when asked. BE LIKE CLINT was unsettled between horses going to the first turn, and retired after a half-mile. RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
POSEIDON'S SON broke alertly then tracked up close three wide just off the top pair, moved up mid-way through the turn and engaged EXTRACTION
WILL for the lead, came four wide into the upper stretch, shook free and pulled away under a strong hand ride. EXTRACTION WILL sped to the lead and led
the way by a slim margin into the turn, vied inside of POSEIDON'S SON at the quarter pole, then failed to match strides with the winner in the upper stretch,
stayed on and secured second best. GHOST FIGHTER raced three to four wide off the early speed, hustled along four wide into the upper stretch and made
some belated progress to gain show. RED SKY TONIGHT bumped with rival at the start then chased in range, hustled along three wide in close contention
around the turn, came two wide into the lane and flattened out. ASTRAL WEEKS prompted the early pace, flattened midway around the turn and continued
to tire in the drive. PATAGONIAN EMPIRE lagged behind in early stages, hustled along five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. FREDDY'S
MUSIC bumped with rival at the start, raced three to four wide off the pace and failed to move into contention. RACE WAS HAND TIMED, TIMES
CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
SIX MINUS settled in midpack while racing two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. THE GREAT OZ
led early, was content to settle back into a tracking position while still saving ground, re-bid inside of the pacesetter nearing the quarter pole, drew clear in
upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging and was caught late. MEAN MACHINE saved ground off the pace for six furlongs and rallied inside to
gain the show. ROYALE raced off the pace two wide, shifted further out in upper stretch and improved position while one-paced. BIG BLUE hit the starting
gate and caused the rider to lose the left iron for a little less than a sixteenth of a mile, dropped back to last inside, edged closer two wide around the far
turn, swung five wide in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. BACH saved ground to no avail. SOUPER FORTUNE vied between foes early, got out
entering the first turn, sped to lead in the three path, drew down the backstretch, set the pace still in the three path around much of the far turn and tired
nearing the lane. FORTY FLASH was carried four wide around the first turn, raced up close four wide for six furlongs and retreated. RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.

EL PROFE was up close early outside, took over and moved inside heading into the turn, widened going comfortably to the top of the stretch, got roused
coming to the furlong grounds and remained well in front while drifting out slightly. BACKATYA was unhurried early inside, had the two-path on the turn,
went back to the rail for the final furlong and was up in time for the place. FROSTED ARMOUR chased after EL PROFE around the turn and into the stretch,
and was outfinished for the runner-up spot. SOVEREIGN OF SPEED proved no menace three wide. WOW RUN chased inside to the stretch, and tired.
SIMILAR TASTE trailed outside. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS AND FINAL CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
MR TITO'S was allowed to settle through early stages under a light rating, commenced a three wide bid into the turn, swept by the embattled duo near the
quarter pole, prompted right handed in the upper stretch, responded willingly, pulled away to commanding lead and finished ridden out late. HARD BELLE
tracked the clear top pair three to four wide up the backstretch, advanced four wide to loom a threat at the quarter pole, was no match for pulling away
winner but sustained steady response and secured place. STAY HOME raced three wide off the early pace, advanced into contention late on the turn, came
four to five wide into the upper stretch, continued with interest and cleared the rest. POCO CHARLIE was slow into stride and raced four wide in the back,
was ridden along the inside around the turn and gained position without threatening. THE MIGHTY JUDGE raced four wide off the early pace, hustled along
five wide into the upper stretch and failed to move into contention. POINTER set a pressured pace with KITTEN STREET the only close pursuer up the
backstretch, got collared by the winner late on the turn and came up empty in the lane. KITTEN STREET prompted the pacesetter up the backstretch, vied
two wide into the turn and retreated turning for home. RACE WAS HAND TIMED, SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE

ABSOLUTE GRIT sprinted to the front after the start, showed the way in the two-path around the turn, shook off pursuers to his outside into the stretch and
widened the advantage under pressure. MISTER KELLY got bumped by DOC AMSTER and herded into SEPTEMBERTEN at the start, trailed to the turn,
swung widest for the drive and was up outside DOC AMSTER for second. DOC AMSTER got pushed into MISTER KELLY by AMOR LEJANO at the break
and was slowest away, chased three then four wide around the turn, moved in through the furlong grounds and was outfinished for the place.
SEPTEMBERTEN brushed with MISTER KELLY at the start, saved ground and lacked the needed rally. AMOR LEJANO (ARG) broke in bumping DOC
AMSTER into MISTER KELLY, chased outside ABSOLUTE GRIT for three furlongs, and faltered. PALADIO raced two wide on the turn, and had nothing left

Footnotes
SUMTING RIGHT secured inside position around the first turn, tugged while rated in the early backstretch and briefly took the lead then edged back to
prompt the pace, vied outside of UNCAPTURED GRACE around the far turn, battled on gamely into the lane and shook free in final stages. UNCAPTURED
GRACE held the lead around the first turn then set a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied inside of SUMTING RIGHT around the far turn, battled on
gamely into the lane and failed to match strides in deep stretch. LINN PIER stalked along inside up the backstretch, was ridden inside around the far turn,
cut the corner entering the lane and ran on for a share. JAIMIE'S WARRIOR rated between foes near midpack, hustled along three wide mid-way around
the final turn, came five wide into the upper stretch, stayed on with interest but needed more for serious impact. SOUPER DUPER READY rated while
saving ground up the backstretch, was ridden along the rail around the far turn, came two wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. OPENTHEGATE
tracked in range up the backstretch, hustled along two wide around the far turn, ran on in the upper stretch then flattened late. READY CANDY was briefly
edgy in the gate, veered out and bumped with rival at the start, raced off the early pace, was ridden along into the far turn, shifted out wider approaching top
stretch and failed to move on. PATH TO VICTORY got bumped and steadied at the start, raced outside off the pace, came wide into the lane and never
threatend. TOUCH OF LOVE raced wide into the first turn then settled outside near midpack, failed to progress under pressure around the far turn and
faded. MASKED HEROINE raced in range up the backstretch and came up empty mid-way around the final turn. SPEIGHTFUL JACKIE was off a step slow
at the start and raced in the back throughout. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE
