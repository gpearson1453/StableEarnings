Footnotes
MO HEAT closest to the leader off the inside, advanced on that one into the far turn, put a head in front soon after, shrugged off the runner up turning for
home, drew clear while being kept to task. TANGO KILO broke a step slow, raced back early as a result, advanced with a four wide middle move in the run
up the backstretch, dueled outside the winner midway on that bend, put a head in front, could not match strides with that rival through the stretch while
drifting a bit. NUGGET OF GRACE settled early while racing toward the inside, in the two path through the second turn, displayed some mild late interest to
finish up best of the rest. LOVING LUCKY within striking distance early off the rail, fell back the middle half, angled five wide when moving a bit closer
turning for home, finished up evenly in lacking a late punch. MOUNTAIN PINE off a step slow, trailed most of the way, saved ground second turn, improved
position through the stretch in passing tiring rivals. INDIA TIGER lacked speed, came four wide out of the final turn, failed to muster a response. MAGIC ICE
broke on top, set the pace inside, gave way in the second turn. BIG PETE four wide into the first turn, continued outside, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
STOCK DEAL five wide into first turn, allowed the pace to go early, moved closer four wide far turn, dueled in the three path into the lane, wore that rival
down under firm handling. MISSISSIPPI forwardly placed early while off the inside moved to challenge three wide second turn, dueled inside the winner
turning for home, gave ground grudgingly to the winner, clearly second best. MAJOR KONG lacked early foot while saving ground in the first turn, continued
back up the backstretch, angled out four wide turning for home, staged a mild rally to be clear of the others, no match for the top two. LOVE NEST prompted
the pace four wide in the first turn, put a head in front before a half, dueled into the far turn, faltered when headed by the top two turning for home.
ANDREAS off a step slow, trailed most of the way, remained back. RED AGAIN showed the way into the first turn, dueled the middle half closest to the
inside, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
RARE STRIPE broke to the outside, with the pace while racing outside, vied three wide into the turn, disposed of the other speed turning for home, drew
well clear under token pressure to win ridden out. TAXIT behind the pace while saving ground through the turn, came in the two path for the drive, rallied for
the place, no match for the winner. RESERVE broke out, was straightened and pressed the issue while between foes and inside the winner, proved no
match for that one stretch, nor could he contain the runner up, came back to earn the show. THUNDERHEART broke alertly, set the pace along the inside in
the run up the backstretch, vied through the turn while remaining closest to the inside of the first flight, gradually weakened through the lane, outkicked for
the show. WESLEYAN in mid pace early while off the inside, fell back to trail through the turn, angled out four wide turning for home, improved position by
passing tiring rivals. CHROME RUN fell back to trail, saved ground through most of the turn, made little impact through the stretch. TAKE NO PRISONERS
broke in the air to spot the field a few lengths, was used a bit to move up closer along the inside late backstretch and into the turn, had little left for the
stretch run. QUARANTINE WHISKEY broke out raced on the outside while lacking speed, began to give way late in the turn, continued to fade through the
lane.

Footnotes
COGBURN broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch while snuggly in hand, continued to rate turn, drew out through upper stretch, kept to task.
IGNITIS lacked speed just off the inside, continued in the two path when moving a bit closer through the turn, asked late in the bend, long drive for the pace,
proved determined for that position late while between foes, no match for the winner. B SUDD moved off the inside early, asked along while between horses
late in the turn, steered out a bit for the drive, widest of the second flight, outfinished for the place. PENETRATOR pressured the winner from the outside for
a half, continued to chase that one pace the furlong marker, weakened late to lose a couple of positions. DOCTOR LOVE hesitated at the break, trailed well
back for a half, steered out to be widest in the drive, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. FORTY STRIPES forwardly placed while racing
along the inside, began a steady fade before a half. PRESSURE in mid pack while racing four wide, tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SULWE off the pace toward the inside, circled four wide into the lane, rallied, late surge to win going away. GOLD STRATEGY took control along the inside
soon after the start, continued to show the way past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late, proved game for the second spot. HAMAZING
DEBATE in mid pack while toward the inside dropped to the rail midway on the turn, in some traffic late in the bend, improved into the lane, not enough late
for the place. PRINIA prompted the leader off the inside, continued to pursue that one through upper stretch, weakened in the late going to lose the place.
RUN FEARLESS went one paced throughout while racing toward the inside. RUNNINTHESTREETS off a step slow, moved out to race four wide through
the turn, failed to muster a rally. MISS DUTTON broke pace, raced in the two path through the turn, passed tiring rivals, never a threat. MO STYLISH failed
to menace while saving ground most of the way. SWEETNESS TO in the second flight for a half, backed up through the lane. LITTLE ROCKER finished
early, trailed home.

Footnotes
MONTGOMERY PARK with the pace from the start off the inside, dropped to the rail turn, larger lead with a furlong remaining, enough left to hold the runner
up safe late. EPICUREAN back off the pace and the inside, moved closer three wide and between rivals late in the turn, lost some ground to the winner into
the lane, slowly getting to that one late. FIFTH RISK last away, trailed early, angled out to be four wide turning for home, staged a rally and finished up
willingly to be also getting to the winner late. WOOHOO JACKIE BLUE in the 2nd flight up the backstretch, dueled through most of the turn, weakened in the
drive. MEGAN'S CLARA forwardly placed for a half, had little left for the stretch run. LEGENDARY GIFT in the second flight well out in the strip, four to five
wide turn, lacked a closing response. GRAVITRON pressed the winner early from along the inside, shuffled back a bit into the turn, continued to save
ground through the bend, came up empty when clear for the drive. CHASING SHADOWS broke back, trailed throughout while racing outside.

Footnotes
GO WEST away in good order, stalked the leader under confident handling off the inside, challenged outside that rival late in the final turn, dueled into the
lane, shook clear then held the runner up safe late under steady handling. GREATHEART behind the pace while in hand and saving ground,continued along
the inside final turn, roused when straightened for home, steered out, closing the gap on the winner late. BEST BET broke on top, showed the way into the
first turn just off the inside, continued to set the pace in the two path the middle half, briefly dueled with the winner into the lane then began to falter when
headed by that rival. HELLMAN off a step slow, trailed early in the two path, continued just off the inside through the second turn when moving a bit closer,
went evenly through the lane in lacking a further advance. CRONUS broke back, lacked speed off rail, came four wide out of the final turn, failed to muster a
closing response. ONE MORE BABY went one paced throughout while racing off the inside. BEST TIME was finished early while racing outside, distanced
after losing contact with the field stretch.

Footnotes
MOJO MAN away well, set the pace in the two path, continued to show the way through the turn off the inside, edged clear past the furlong marker, held the
runner up safe late under steady handling. TOP GUNNER forwardly placed while racing outside, four wide through the turn when moving a bit closer, could
not get to the winner late, pulling away for the place. LYKAN back off the pace and the inside, four wide through the turn, staged a mild rally to be up late for
the show. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK went one paced while racing off the inside. JALEN JOURNEY off a step slow, raced back, five wide through the turn,
passed a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat. HOME BASE chased the winner early well off the inside, moved a bit closer in the turn, gave way
in the drive. BOLDOR off a step slow, moved up steadily to be within striking distance along the rail late in the turn, backed up through the lane.

Footnotes
THE BUS broke on top, set the pace along the inside toward the inside, continued to rate through the turn, extended that advantage in upper stretch then
maintained while being kept to task. CATS GOTTA CHANCE in mid pack while racing outside, four wide through much of the turn came three wide for the
drive, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. RISKY SITUATION off the early pace and the inside, in the two path through the turn, finished up
best of the rest. LOU'S ARROW lacked early foot outside, raced four out to five wide through the turn, improved position in upper stretch then failed to
sustain that advance the final furlong. CYBERTOWN void of speed, raced well wide into the turn, came five wide into the lane, improved a bit in the stretch,
no real threat. DIESEL FUEL unruly prior to loading, broke in to bother FULL BUCK MOON, went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. AUX
ARCS fractious in the gate, broke sluggishly, raced well back for a half, picked off some tiring rivals while never a serious threat. CONCOCTION within
striking distance, saved ground through the turn, tired in the drive. SACRAMENT chased the winner while off the inside, gave way in the drive. PACIFIC
HARBOR forwardly placed off the inside, four wide turning for home, tired in the drive. FULL BUCK MOON bothered at the start to be off slow, remained
always back while off the inside.
