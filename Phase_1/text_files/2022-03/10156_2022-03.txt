Footnotes
PRETTY PRINCESS, brushed at the start, came through along the inside to track just off the leaders racing to the turn turn, tipped out three wide in upper
stretch and continued with a steady bid to wrest the advantage under confident handling. WATER WIZARD angled inwards to prompt the pace outside a
rival on the backstretch, pressed the issue to gain a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, dueled past midstretch but proved no match for the winner
late. FALL CAMPAIGN tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing to the turn, was fanned four wide into the lane and continued evenly while
earning a share. TWIN BRIDGES, urged from the break disputing the pace inside a rival a bit off the inside on the backstretch, dueled inside that foe
through the turn to the lane and gave way leaving midstretch. ESTILO DIFERENTE, bumped from both sides at the start, was righted to race just off the
leaders between foes under rating racing to the turn but gave way into upper stretch. ADIOS DEE DEE swerved in, bumping ESTILO DIFERENTE, then
was settled last in early stages and proved no threat. STERLINA broke outwards bumping ESTILO DIFERENTE, then shifted in brushing the eventual
winner, was switched out four wide racing through the backstretch making brief pursuit of the leaders, drifted out markedly approaching the three furlong
marker and quickly gave way.

Footnotes
SCHOCHOH ducked outwards slightly at the start, was urged to force the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, shifted out to the three
path racing through the stretch and continued under firm encouragement to just hold GOLDEN TONE to the end. The latter settled off the second flight
racing through the backstretch, was prompted to command a steady rally in the four path nearing upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on
the winner to the wire. BLAKENSTEIN tracked just off the first flight under light rating stalking those foes into the bend, shifted inwards while coming under
pressure to advance racing into upper stretch and lacked the needed final kick. SEAZAN broke slowly, was settled last racing to the stretch, then displayed
some belated interest outside rivals in the closing stages. LAST INVESTMENT broke outwards brushing BLAKENSTEIN, was righted quickly, then urged
inside a rival disputing the pace into the turn, gave way leaving midstretch. CUZ made brief pursuit of the leaders along the inside and dropped out early.

Footnotes
FIRSTCADETE was reserved off the second flight outside foes in the opening stages, made a steady advance on the leaders four wide through the turn,
wrested the advantage in that path racing through upper stretch and went well clear late in a ridden out effort. LUCA DREW THE ACE tracked just off the
first flight three deep racing to the turn, advanced in that path to gain the advantage between calls nearing upper stretch but proved no match when
confronted by the winner. TEDDY'S HONOR angled inwards in early stages while being urged to prompt the pace outside a rival racing into the bend, then
faded between rivals in late stages while prevailing for a share. CHRISTMAS PRESENT tracked off the first flight along the inside early, saved ground to
upper stretch and made an effort to improve position inside rivals late. AKTHAM angled inwards while being rated between foes in second flight racing to the
turn but lacked the needed closing response. MAKOTO, urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset, edged forward to a narrow advantage
entering the bend but gave way once headed nearing upper stretch. CLEAR TO CLOSE dropped out early.

Footnotes
MIZZEN AIR was off last, but sped to the lead inside foes racing into the first turn, dictated terms on a narrow advantage in the opening half, tipped off the
rail nearing the far turn to meet a rival's challenge, was headed momentarily racing into upper stretch but held gamely to the end under firm left handed
pressure. HUSH Y'ALL, caught in tight quarters, then held up just after the start, angled to the inside racing to the first turn to track just off the pacesetter to
the backstretch, tipped outside that foe after a half while being prompted to advance, pressed the issue outside the winner through the far turn past
midstretch while striking the front between calls but proved only second best. ATLANTIC PRINCESS raced three deep between foes to the first turn, then
tracked just off the leaders outside a rival on the backstretch, continued three wide through the far turn into upper stretch and finished evenly while
prevailing for a share. WORKING OVERTIME tracked just off the leaders along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued
with an even effort. SASSY MISS MARGIE, caught five wide in the opening stages, angled to the inside racing to the backstretch while dropping off the
second flight and failed to menace thereafter. FUN PADDY, caught four wide racing into the first turn, dropped back to race off the second flight outside a
rival and never proved a serious threat.

FAIR GAME was rated along the inside stalking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, came through inside that foe to challenge when presented an
opening racing into upper stretch, wrested the advantage leaving the furlong marker and kicked away under brisk handling. MILLER'S MAIDEN broke
readily, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside to the backstretch, tipped off the inside while being roused to resist several challengers
racing into upper stretch, proved no match for the winner but kept on well to prove best of the others. FALL MOON threw her head while coming under
rating on the chute, switched outside foes to settle three deep racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide on the far turn, was fanned five
wide into upper stretch while exchanging some contact with KITTEN WITH A WHIP, but continued with a steady effort outside foes to prevail for a share
while moving to close the gap late. KITTEN WITH A WHIP was rated just off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide
nearing upper stretch carrying out FALL MOON, then exchanging some contact with that rival, but kept on with interest while just missing for a share. BOCA
tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, saved ground gaining some position racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed closing
bid. PENTAGON, reserved between foes in the last flight leaving the chute, was steadied a bit in close quarters entering the first turn, continued unhurried to
the far turn, was prompted to advance between foes entering the lane but was outkicked for a share. JEAN V'S LEGACY, forwardly placed attending a
rival's pace in the opening half, was urged to lodge a brief bid between foes nearing upper stretch but quickly came up empty. JOYOUS TIMES, caught four
wide leaving the chute, was prompted to a forward placing three deep attending the pace to the backstretch, was urged to make a brief bid in that path
nearing upper stretch, then drifted out into the paths of KITTEN WITH A WHIP and FALL MOON entering the lane while quickly giving way.

OXBOW KID, in touch with the first flight between rivals in the opening quarter, was eased off the pace to track the leaders along the inside racing into the
turn, tipped out to advance on the leaders three wide between racing into upper stretch, bid for command in tandem with TAKEMYSHOT approaching the
furlong marker and edged forward in the closing stages under firm encouragement. The latter was rated just outside the first flight while racing six wide in
the opening stages, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the turn, continued in that path into upper stretch while dueling with the winner to late
stages but was outkicked. STREET LAMP, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, dueled for command past midstretch but
yielded to the top pair late. TEMPESTUOUS broke inwards bumping ZIPPER ZAPPER, was quickly righted, then urged three wide between foes dueling for
command through the backstretch, continued to press the issue outside a rival to midstretch but weakened once collared by the top pair late. ZIPPER
ZAPPER bobbled at the start, then was bumped while knocked off stride momentarily just after the break, settled last racing to the turn, swung out six wide
entering the stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. HE'SSOSUBTLE was settled while angling to the inside early, saved ground to the lane
but never gained contention. PELLEGRINI vied for command four wide between foes through the backstretch and gave way after a half. HEAVY WEIGHT
joined the pace five wide in the opening stages pressing the issue but gave way racing into the turn. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

FORBIDDEN DREAM hopped at the start while getting away last, pulled her way between foes to position in second flight after a half, angled to the inside
on the far turn while steadily closing the gap on the leaders, shifted out three wide entering the lane while moving to challenge for command midstretch and
just prevailed in time under firm handling. HUNTRESS MOON was prompted to a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch,
advanced to wrest the advantage from that rival with a quarter mile to go, resisted the winner's bid to the end but came up second best. FOXGLOVE settled
along the inside in the opening half, switched out midway through the backstretch, was prompted to advance while swinging out four wide nearing upper
stretch but lacked the needed closing response. MAJESTIC QUEEN, in touch along the inside racing to the chute, was rated just off the leaders along the
inside racing to the first turn, dropped back to last after a half, saved ground throughout and produced a second effort to regain some position inside
foeslate. BUMBLELICIOUS was firmly rated between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the far turn but lacked the
needed closing response. FORT DRUM sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a clear margin to the far turn but gave out once headed
nearing upper stretch. MAP THE MOMENT tracked the leaders three wide in second flight in the opening stages, made some brief progress in that path on
the backstretch but soon emptied out.

Footnotes
TENEBRIS, in touch with the leaders racing just off the first flight, was prompted to advance three deep between foes after a half, bid for command between
foes nearing midstretch and continued with a steady late response in a sustained drive to narrowly prevail under brisk left handed encouragement. RIVES,
urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch and contested the issue grudgingly to the
end while just failing to contain the winner. ZUZUDINI was rated just off the first flight on the backstretch, steadily advanced to contention four wide through
the turn to upper stretch and continued willingly outside the top pair to challenge for command in the closing stages. MOTAWAAFEQ angled inwards while
being rated just off the first flight on the backstretch, switched out racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance but had no rally. KINGSWOOD
broke sharply, prompted the pace outside a rival in early stages, pressed the issue between foes through the turn and gave way racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH was rated along the inside racing as part of the second flight, saved ground on the far turn gathering momentum, tipped out
entering upper stretch, lugged inwards a bit under pressure, but came under correction while continuing with a steady late effort to prevail in time under firm
handling. GREAT BRITAIN broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside through the backstretch to the far turn, kicked clear
nearing upper stretch but couldn't fend off the winner's late bid. BARBERINI, held up out of close quarters just after the start, was reserved along the inside,
saved ground to upper stretch, then altered course three wide leaving midstretch to close the gap while prevailing for a share. LAST SECOND LOUIE,
urged to a forward placing prompting the pacesetter to the far turn, gave way into the lane. PANADERO was rated off the second flight a bit off the inside,
angled out nearing upper stretch but lacked a closing bid. SHIMMERING LEROID tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, was fanned three wide
into upper stretch and gave way. KISS PRINCIPAL settled last early and failed to menace. SHINBORO tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight for
a half and gave way racing through the far turn. CUPID'S GHOST settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the far turn and dropped out nearing the
lane.
