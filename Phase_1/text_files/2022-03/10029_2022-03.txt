Footnotes
PEACE PIPE was away alertly and was hustled to set the pace while being prompted by DEL MAR FLASH, extended the lead a bit on the runner-up off of
the second turn, felt pressure in the final sixteenth and held to prevail under steady urging. DEL MAR FLASH was sent after the break to prompt the pace,
lost a bit of ground to PEACE PIPE leaving the second turn, closed on that foe in the final sixteenth and missed for the win, while clear of the rest for
second. SMOKINHOTREDHEAD settled in the early running, was steered four wide on the second turn, swung widest into the stretch and rallied in the late
going to be a clear third. FOGGY BOTTOM was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the half-mile marker, lost ground on the far turn and did not
offer a late bid in the stretch. BORN TO REIGN settled just off of the early pace, was steered three wide on the second turn and lacked a late rally in the
stretch run. CLASS CODE was under a snug hold on the first turn while taking back off of the early pace, stalked the pace from the inside to the second
turn, lost ground nearing the quarter-marker and gave way in the late stages.

Footnotes
WOLF MOON WILSON settled off of the early pace while outside of foes, steadied a bit entering the second turn, angled out four wide nearing the
quarter-marker, closed fast into the final furlong, took command nearing the sixteenth-marker and kicked clear in the end. YOU'RE THE CAUSE prompted
the pace to the half-mile marker, closed on the pacesetter nearing the quarter pole, took command into the stretch, could not hold off the fast closing winner
in the final furlong but was clear of the rest for second. SIERRA SNOW STORM saved ground while stalking the pace, gained ground along the second turn
and was outkicked in the stretch drive. EVEN STEVEN settled off of the early pace while just off of the rail, gained ground five wide on the second turn and
finished evenly in the late going. SPLIT ACES was hustled after breaking alertly and set the pace through the half-mile marker, was pressed into the second
turn by YOU'RE THE CAUSE, was overtaken by that foe leaving the second turn and tired in the stretch. NORWESTER stalked the early pace outside of
rivals, gained ground along the backstretch run, was three wide along the far turn and weakened in the late stages.

ECOLOGIST stalked the pace while saving all of the ground, made an inside bid leaving the second turn, overtook A MAN'S MAN just inside of the furlong
marker and drew clear in the end. A MAN'S MAN prompted the pace through the first half-mile, was floated out a bit when UNTHROTTLED drifted nearing
the quarter-pole, overtook that foe nearing the furlong marker, could not hold off ECOLOGIST inside of the final furlong and was outfinished in the end while
besting the rest. COOLCROSS saved ground while unhurried in the early going, gained ground on the far turn while two wide and continued that bid into the
stretch to share for third. UNTHROTTLED broke alertly and was sent to set the pace, was prompted into the second turn by A MAN'S MAN, drifted out a
path nearing the quarter-marker, was overtaken nearing the furlong grounds, weakened in the late stages and dead-heated for the show. LORD
WIMBORNE (IRE) was allowed to settle in the early stages, improved position on the second turn while three wide and lacked a late rally in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BERNALINHO saved ground while settling off of the early pace, was steered three wide on the far turn, came within aim approaching the furlong grounds,
overtook DARK PRINCE nearing the sixteenth-marker and held safely in the end over the oncoming runner-up. KALINE sat just off of the early pace while
saving ground, improved position along the backstretch run, stayed along the inside on the far turn, tipped out leaving the turn and closed well in the late
stages but could not reel in the winner in the end. DARK PRINCE broke alertly and was hustled to set the fractions, was prompted into the second turn while
setting a moderately fast pace, had a clear lead nearing the furlong grounds but was caught inside of the sixteenth-marker and outfinished, while well clear
of the rest. CANYON CREST trailed in the early stages while showing no early speed, improved position nearing the half-mile marker, was steered three
wide along the second turn and made a mild late gain in the drive. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET tracked the moderately fast pace through the second turn, lost
ground into the stretch run and gave way in the late stages. BIG CITY BANE stalked the early pace outside of rivals, lost ground on the second turn and
weakened in the final stages.

Footnotes
ALQWANI was off slowly, recovered well to chase the pace into the turn outside of rivals, continued to gain ground into the lane, confronted CITY GLITTER
leaving the furlong marker, made a late push to get by that foe and held over the oncoming runner-up. ACCORDING TO JUDY chased the early pace from
a two wide path, angled out to swing widest into the stretch, closed well in the late stages and could not reel in the winner in the end but was up in time for
the place. CITY GLITTER broke alertly and was sent to the front at the start, shook free of MINER'S MELODY nearing the quarter-marker and had a clear
lead into the stretch, was confronted by the winner leaving the furlong grounds, battled back against that bid but was outfinished in the end while well clear
of the rest for the show. MINER'S MELODY tracked the pace through the turn, was outrun into the stretch drive and weakened in the final stages.
GOVERNOR SPECIAL stalked the early pace while along the inside, lost ground into the stretch run and tired in the late going. CONNIE'S PROMISE
chased the early pace from towards the rear, saved ground through the turn and gave way in the late stages. AFTERDINNERDRINK chased the early pace
outside of foes, lost position on the turn and was empty for the stretch run.

Footnotes
JIMMY BLUE JEANS broke in good order and was sent leaving the start, rated nicely while being well handled through the backstretch run, extended the
lead off of the far turn, was kept to task in the final stages and held over the closing runner-up. TESORO was forwardly placed in the early stages, was
under a tight hold while prompting the pace through the backstretch run, gave a bit of ground to JIMMY BLUE JEANS into the stretch, closed on that foe in
the final stages but could not reel him in while holding for the place in the end. TOM'S SURPRISE took back in the early stages to sit just off of the early
pace, advanced on the second turn while three wide, continued that bid to close in the stretch run but could not reel in the top pair and was outfinished,
while clear of the rest for the show. SHADRACK stumbled at the start and was off a step slowly, settled off of the pace while saving ground and lacked a late
kick in the stretch run. WINE AND WHISKY stalked the early pace from a two wide path, lost ground into the stretch run and weakened in the final stages.
READY SAY GO was a bit slow into stride early, was unhurried through the early going, gained ground while three wide on the second turn but did not
mount a late rally in the drive.

Footnotes
NORTH SEA was forwardly placed in the early going while saving ground, mounted an inside bid off of the turn to close on the leading pair, took command
nearing the final sixteenth and edged clear in the late stages. THECHIEFHASTRICKS was away alertly and showed good early speed through the turn,
came under pressure nearing the furlong marker, battled against the winner but could not hold him off, was caught nearing the sixteenth-marker and just
saved second in the end. INTO BOURBON chased the early pace, advanced while three wide on the turn, vied for the lead approaching the furlong grounds
and was outfinished in the final sixteenth, while just missing for second. WORD OF WARNING bobbled at the start, chased the pace from the inside through
the turn and was outkicked in the stretch run. FANTASTIC DREAM was bumped by UNCLE DANNY at the break and was off slowly, lacked early speed to
the turn, was two wide nearing the quarter-marker and made a mild late rally in the stretch. UNCLE DANNY bumped FANTASTIC DREAM leaving the start,
tracked the pace to the turn, steadied in traffic at the three-eighths marker, lost ground into the stretch and gave way in the late stages. TAM'S TIME was a
bit slow into stride in the early stages, saved ground while lacking speed on the turn and was not a factor. THE CALABRESE KID chased the early pace to
the turn, checked in tight quarters at the three furlong marker, lost ground into the stretch run, was aggressively steered out nearing the sixteenth-marker
and bothered TRIBUTE TO ART and tired in the late going. TRIBUTE TO ART crowded WHISPER AND WINK at the break, chased the early pace to the
turn, lost ground into the stretch, was aggressively bumped by THE CALABRESE KID nearing the sixteenth-marker when that one was steered out and
gave way in the final stages. WHISPER AND WINK was crowded at the start and off a step slowly, lacked early speed to the turn while outside of rivals and
was not a threat.
