Footnotes
BRIAR THICKET was settled early, advanced five wide on the turn, closed well on the outside to catch the front runner with about eighty yards to go and
edged away to prove best, driving. CANDY'S STORY set the early pace from the inside, drew out leaving the turn but was caught in deep stretch, second
best. TRUEBLUEGIRL was allowed to settle early, then raced on the inside on the turn, angled out in the drive and had a mild late rally to gain the show
award. DEDE'S TRICK chased the early pace and was three to four wide on the turn and made a mild bid by the quarter pole but had no punch in the drive.
FINAL TABLE passed the tiring rivals. MAGGIE'S WILL stalked the pace three wide and came into the drive three wide but was empty. SENSING GOLD
chased the early pace three wide and weakened. TIMBER LADY failed to menace. SIMPLY TIMELESS was not a factor.

bid nearing the quarter pole, finished willingly but could not gain on the winner while being clearly second best. FIRST LINE was allowed to settle early,

WHENTHEDOVESCRY was well placed on the inside, then made a inside bid leaving the turn and took over, then drew clear to prove best under left
handed urging. SMARTY GRIMES was allowed to settle early and was on the inside on the turn, swung out five wide for the drive and finished willingly to be
clearly second best. MARVELOUS THUNDER stalked the pace three wide and came four wide into the drive and came up empty, held show award.
AGAVE KID was settled back early and advanced on the inside, shifted out three wide at the sixteenths pole and had a belated rally. FIVE O ONE was
settle three wide, then was four wide on the turn and came six wide into the drive and had no rally. PRIVATE LAKE was reserved while wide and came eight
wide into the drive and had no rally. BURTNJOE chased the pace four wide and came five wide into the drive and weakened. RUSTY CAGE set the pace
two wide and faltered in the drive. C H JAY failed to menace.

Footnotes
HARDLY A SECRET was allowed to settle early towards the inside, made a three wide move on the far turn, hit the front leaving the turn and drew off to
prove much the best, driving. TOMATO BILL was three wide into the first turn, then dropped to the inside to set the pace, was headed on the turn and
proved to be no match for the winner, stayed on to be second best. CASHANOVA was rated along the inside, then eased out on the turn and came four
wide into the drive but had no kick, bested rest. RIVER ECHO (GB) was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide and weakened. ZITMAN
lacked a rally. ALL WEST was four wide into the first turn, then settled five wide on the backstretch and had no rally. SACRED OATH was reserved early,
then was four wide on the turn and lacked a rally. CABOT was settled early in between rivals four wide and stopped on the turn.

SUMMER SHOES tracked the early pace four wide, then went up to vie for command by the half mile marker, dueled for the lead three wide on the turn,
shook clear leaving the turn and kicked away to prove best under a drive. MOCHA KISS tracked the early pace in between rivals, then went up to vie for the
lead three wide by the half mile marker, dueled with the winner on the inside on the turn, then could not match strides with that rival late while staying on
gamely to be clearly second best. HEATED ARGUMENT steadied on the inside nearing the half mile marker, then shifted out and made a three wide move
on the turn, tipped out four wide leaving the turn and weakened, held show award. DUTCH TREAT was allowed to settle early on the inside, eased out on
the turn and came four wide into the drive and had a belated rally for the minor rewards. TAPIT RIGHT was settled early, made a four wide move on the turn
but came up empty in the drive. OOCHIE was hustled early and crossed over at the nine sixteenths and stopped.
