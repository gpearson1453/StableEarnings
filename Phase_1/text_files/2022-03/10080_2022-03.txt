Footnotes
MOMENT TO DREAM rushed to vie for the lead outside of a rival while staying a path away from that foe, assumed command turning for home, then drew
off under driving pressure through the final furlong. RYDENSEEK stalked in the three path around the turn, then gained place in upper stretch while proving
no match for her entry-mate. MO BELLA took a solid bump from an outer rival causing her to bump an inner foe at the start, tracked in midpack along the
inside, shifted four wide at the furlong grounds, and stayed on while hanging on her left lead. SWEET JACKIELEIGH chased in the two path while under a
stern drive turning for home, but lacked a response and tired. LAWSUIT LUCY bumped an inner foe at the start, raced far back in the two path, and
improved. COSMIC BELLE broke inwardly, set the pace inside of the eventual winner into the turn, but proved no match turning for home, and weakened.
HAIRTRIGGER HEART bobbled at the start and never got involved. ELLIE'S A WILDCAT bumped with an outer rival soon after the start, raced forwardly
placed four wide, but faded entering the turn. SAVANNAH'S HERE broke inwardly, raced off of the pace along the inside, but drifted out in upper stretch
before tiring.

Footnotes
FOREVER DREAMING stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the clear leader into the backstretch, bid into the far turn along with an outer rival, showed
the way through upper stretch, dug in as rivals produced bids on either side in the final furlong, and held firm. YOUENS laid off of the pace two wide and
between horses, tracked behind the top trio while getting floated three wide turning for home, shifted inwardly in upper stretch for clear sailing inside of the
leader, grinded away to produce a bid in the final furlong, but was fended off. READY TO VENTURE (GB) laid off of the pace three wide, inched closer to
stalk outside of the leading trio around the far turn, produced a five wide bid in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, ranged up outside of the leader
while changing over to his right lead at the furlong grounds, but lacked the needed punch in the closing stages. TECATE TIME tracked two wide, vied three
wide around the far turn, then four wide entering the lane, but yielded between horses at the three sixteenths pole. NOW YUS CANT LEAVE trailed three to
four wide around the first turn, and failed to factor. SCARLETT LACE tracked along the inside, stalked into the far turn as the field bunched together, shifted
two wide and between horses turning for home, but tired in upper stretch. MO NORMAL cleared off into the first turn, showed the way inside of a pair of
bidding rivals into the far turn, but was headed at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened through the lane. DRAWN TO RACE (GER) was outrun.

CHEETARA (CHI) stalked three wide around the turn, got floated to the five path entering the lane, failed to gain on the leader through midstretch while
chasing, but stayed on determinedly late, menaced outside of a bidding EUPHORIC after the pace-setter gave way in the final sixteenth, and bested that foe
at the wire. EUPHORIC pressed the pace two wide, bid a the five sixteenths pole, but was turned away while drifting to the four path entering the lane,
chased the leader through upper stretch, kept on to produce a late re-bid in the final sixteenth as the leader wavered, led fifty yards from home, but was
nailed ot the wire by an outer foe. STERLING MISS set the pace along the inside, met EUPHORIC's challenge at the five sixteenths pole, repelled that rival
and shook clear entering the lane, held sway through midstretch, but tired in the final furlong, gave in late, and just lasted for show. BECCA'S ROCKET
brushed with an inner rival at the start, trailed the field two wide, then chased the top trio through the lane, and missed reaching a tiring foe for show. PALIO
FLAG brushed an outer foe at the start, tracked along the inside, but tired through the lane.

RUSSIAN MAFIA bumped with an outer foe at the start, settled far back along the inside, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, rallied outside of foes in the
final furlong, and reeled in the leaders in the late stages to gain an advantage approaching the wire. POSTNUP stalked the clear leader from the two path,
inched closer between horses in the three path around the far turn to vie among rivals approaching the lane, led narrowly approaching the three sixteenths,
but got headed by an outer foe at that marker, fought back to reclaim an advantage approaching the final sixteenth, but was nailed in the closing stages.
DAZZLING SUN (SAF) bumped with an inner rival while put to a bit of tight quarters among foes at the start, laid off of the pace three wide, gained in the
five path around the far turn to join the leading trio turning for home, led while shifting ground inwardly at the three sixteenths pole, but hung on her left lead,
and yielded to rivals on either side in the final sixteenth. CLARA PEETERS (GB) settled in the two to three path, tracked the leading group around the far
turn, then chased the leaders evenly through the lane while hanging on her left lead. FLATTER ME SILLY laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the
eight path in midstretch, and stayed on, but failed to theaten. MAID OF HONOR saved ground in midpack, but to no avail. STROLLIN THE BAYOU set a
clear pace, met a trio of bids around the far turn while a path off of the rail, and faded in upper stretch. PRINCESS THEOREM trailed in the three to four
paths, and made little impacct. GIANNA'S GIFT stalked in the three path, vied three wide and between horses while in the four path turning for home, but

Footnotes
BRON AND BROW stalked three wide, assumed command from the leading pair at the three furlong pole, then drew off in upper stretch, and was driven
home. ORDER UP dueled for the lead inside inside of a rival, but proved no match for an outer bidding foe at the three furlong pole, shifted outwardly in
upper stretch, and held place through the lane. PRADO'S PRIORITY stalked the dueling pair from along the inside, but was outmoved by an outer rival into
the turn, shifted outside of the early pace-setting pair approaching the five sixteenths pole, then floated to the seven path in upper stretch while pursuing
ORDER UP for place, but only managed to chase that foe home. GUTZY was mildly bumped between horses at the start, trailed three wide, came into the
lane in the six path, and moved up for a minor share. DREWMAZING bumped with an inner foe at the start, then saved ground near the rear, but to no avail.
BASEBALL LOVER laid off of the pace two wide, came into the lane in the four path, and failed to factor. TWO B bumped with an outer rival at the start,
dueled for the lead inside of a foe, but proved no match for an outer bidding challenger at the three furlong pole, and weakened through the lane.

UNIFIED REPORT tracked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair to take aim at the furlong grounds, surged with a late kick, and just got up on
the wire. CHARCO prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead at the furlong grounds, led entering the final sixteenth, but was nailed on the wire.
KISSALOT laid off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide and between horses approaching midstretch, but only produced a mild kick, and reached a tiring
rival for show. GLACIAL rushed inside of rivals to set the pace, held sway through upper stretch, but met CHARCO's challenge at the furlong grounds,
yielded to that foe approaching the final sixteenth, and got nailed on the wire for show. BUCKINGHAM PRINCE stalked in the three path, shifted to the five
path entering the lane, but lacked a bid. BALADI broke a beat slowly, saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. ALEBRIJE was outrun. NINETIES
COUNTRY stalked in the four path, but was floated to the six path entering the lane before fading.

KNEESNHIPS settled off of the pace in the two path, got outmoved by outer foes turning for home to trail approaching the lane, then swung to outside fence
in upper stretch for better ground, rallied on her left lead while widest of all, and edged clear late. CALIFORNIA ANGEL broke a bit outwardly at the start, sat
reserved far back along the inside, attempted a three to five wide gain around the far turn before fanning to the ten path in upper stretch, brushed multiple
times with an inner rival while rallying on her left lead through the final furlong as an outer foe did the same, got outkicked by that rival in the final sixteenth,
then reached place on the wire. NEW YEAR'S EVE brushed with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the four path, gained while swinging to the nine path
entering the lane, shied mildly from an inner foe at the three sixteenths pole before brushing with rivals on either side in midstretch, then rallied to gain an
advantage entering the final sixteenth, but flattened out late, and got outfinished by a pair of outer rivals. TAYLOR'S SECRET set the pace in the three path,
felt pressure from rivals on either side into the far turn, vied with them around that bend before shifting to the six path entering the lane, got headed by an
inner foe in upper stretch, fought on into the final furlong, but was outkicked by an outer trio a the sixteenth pole, then regained fourth late.
DREAMWORKER stalked two wide, got floated four wide entering the backstretch before rating back, tracked in the two path around the far turn, bid inside
of drifting foes passing the quarter pole, led in upper stretch, but faltered entering the final sixteenth. PEARL EARRING tracked from midpack in the three
path, tucked to the rail into the far turn, then shifted tot he five path in upper stretch, but lacked a kick between horses. CECILITA brushed with an outer foe
at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, swung to the eight path in upper stretch, but steadied off an inner foe's heels when that foe shifted across
her path, and failed to menace thereafter. LOLLOPING stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the pace setter and to the four path entering the
backstretch, vied three wide from that path around the far turn, got floated to the seven path at the quarter pole, drifted to the eight path and into an outer
rival's lane at the three sixteenths pole, then weakened between horses while on her left lead at the furlong grounds. LUCK IS FICKLE tracked along the
inside while pulling and rank around the first turn, tugged inside of rivals to press down the backstretch, vied into the far turn, but weakened turning for
home, caved in upper stretch, and was eased.

MACEE prompted the pace two wide, led in the three path in upper stretch, drew clear and held sway. RUN NATALIE RUN stalked along the inside, grinded
away along the rail in hopes of bidding inside of the leader, but did not have enough. THAT'S MY MAMA tracked in the three path, drifted from the four to
five path in upper stretch, and lacked a bid. ASK DALE took back between horses early on, trailed along the inside, swung to the seven path entering the
lane, and stayed on. OURS AND THEIRS broke a beat slowly, gained from far back in the five path around the turn, but hung on his left lead and flattened
out in upper stretch. MISS BARETA was urged along in midpack in the two path around the turn, and failed to factor. HONEYSUCKLEDELIGHT set the
pace along the inside, shifted off fo the rail entering the lane, then weakened between horses while hanging on his left lead. ISN'T IT TIME made little
impact. DREWSILLA popped the gate open pre-race, and steadily faded.
