BULLET BUTCH settled inside, was asked for run on the turn, angled out in the stretch and edged ahead driving. RUFFY dueled along the inside
throughout and continued gamely to the finish. REX KWON DO earned a narrow edge outside for three quarters and weakened. NORTHERN EXPRESS
trailed early, moved inside and closed well while no threat. PRINCE FILIP stalked the dueling pacesetters outside to the stretch and faded. BATTLE OF
BERLIN was urged close up briefly then stopped abruptly. THE HONORABLE ONE was hampered by broken rein on the backstretch and was eased.

Footnotes
FLIMFLAM MAN advanced inside, angled out to the front at the three eighths pole and drew away under moderate pressure. CANT STOP THIS MAN
prompted the pace outside, was collared by the winner on the turn and continued gamely to the finish. RACK GIN chased wide throughout, bid very wide in
the stretch then flattened out. PERFECT REVENGE lacked speed, moved inside, angled out at the quarter pole and lacked a response. MAINE earned a
narrow lead along the rail then was finished after half a mile. OUCH OUCH OUCH stumbled at the start and was squeezed back then always outrun.
TELLER lacked speed and gave way readily. KIKKERLAND broke alertly and pursued the pacesetters outside briefly then stopped.

Footnotes
BIRD KING settled inside for three quarters, angled out rallying into the stretch, wat put to urging and drew off driving through the final furlong. DREAMS
UNTOLD forced the pace outside, led into the stretch, continued gamely but could not hold off the winner. SPLICETHEMAINBRACE hustled to a clear
inside, was collared on the final turn then weakened. KINGSVILLE reserved off the pacesetters, continued well while no threat. SOUPER FLY OVER
prompted
the
pace
three
wide
to
the
final
turn
and
faltered.
NEW
COMMISSION
saved
ground
well
behind
and

BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON chased outside off the leaders and weakened steadily. BROOKLYN STRONG dropped back after the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HEY MAMALUKE led inside, widened on the turn, bore out through the stretch but remained clear under steady urging. JAKARTA pursued the winner
outside, faded briefly on the turn, angled out then came again too late in the final stages. GLORY DIA lacked speed along the inside, loomed a threat in the
stretch but was outfinished. CINNABUNNY lacked speed outside, moved wide on the tur then back inside foes through the lane. SHERO raced close up
outside, made a brief bid on the turn then proved empty in the stretch. PRECIOUS dropped far behind inside and was never in contention. DISCREETLY
TOUGH lacked speed and trailed throughout.

HOLLYWOOD JET moved clear inside, was collared at the quarter pole, battled with outside rival and held on determinedly. SIR ALFRED JAMES chased
near the inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well too late. UNCLE ERNIE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, engaged that one in the stretch
and held on gamely. MOJOVATION lacked speed outside then advanced wide in the stretch with late energy. PRINCE OF RAIN angled inside early,
continued along the rail rallying while no threat. FORTHELUVOFBOURBON was urged close up inside to the stretch, angled out and flattened.
MIDNIGHTCHARLY dropped back after the start then passed fading rivals. BYBEE crowded soon after the start, moved extremely wide on the turn and was
no factor. BREEZY GUST raced off the leaders outside and gave way through the stretch.
