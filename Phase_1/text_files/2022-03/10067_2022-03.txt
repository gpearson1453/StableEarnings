WICKED LUNA was reluctant to load, gave chase inside through the backstretch, steadily improved near the rail on the turn, eased just outside As It Should
Be leaving the turn and dug in to take over late yards. LADY CINCO DE MAYO gave chase, rounded the turn three wide and finished well to take second
the final yards. SUNDOG gave chase outside, raced in the six path of the turn, dug in widest to take third the final yards and was gaining on the runner-up.
AS IT SHOULD BE took the lead at the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, raced near the rail on the turn, dug in under steady encouragement leaving
the turn but was caught flattening stride late yards. DUCHESS OF SHIRE raced well back early, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane.
MY BEST GIRL pressured the pace off the rail, dropped back through the turn then weakened.

DINNER AT FIVE took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the rail to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths, raced
at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. DEVILISH BEAUTY rated just off the early pace inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail then dug in from the head of the lane to take second inside the sixteenth pole. CHIT CHAT GIRL broke out to make contact
with UPSY DAISY DO then stalked off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then ceded second inside the
sixteenth pole. The latter was bumped leaving the gate then settled back in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole,
ran in the three path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. COWGIRL NIGHT came through the first turn in the five path, picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. DAMISELA rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole
then weakened at the rail on the far turn. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
KING NEKIA saved ground off the pace, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and improved position in the three path of the far turn, dug in for the
lead mid-stretch and drew clear the final yards. PROTA took the nod past the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the five
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, was caught mid-stretch and relented late yards. FIRE DOWN BELOW rounded the first turn in the three
path, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the three path, swung five wide into the stretch and was along for third
late yards. COMMAND THE CAT was brushed leaving the gate and raced at even terms inside through the front stretch, stalked past the nine sixteenths
pole and gave chase nearing the three eighths, rounded the far turn at the rail and flattened the final furlong. QUICK ENTRY settled off the rail on the
opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little further. AWESOME BUZZ
settled back off the rail on the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, showed little response and rounded the far turn in the four and five paths.
MUTAKAAMIL rounded the first turn in the four and five paths, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole then faded into the far turn. JOHNNY
OBVIOUS steadied from tight quarters early then saved ground. HAN SENSE broke outward to make light contact with Command The Cat then rounded the
opening turn in the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened toward the far turn. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
FIBER AND EMILY rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole and contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn,
dug in under steady stretch influence and just lasted. ISHIHARA settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far
turn, dug in from the head of the lane to take second late stretch and was gaining on the waning winner. SAVATIANO ducked out at the break then angled
in and settled back saving ground, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, dug in leaving the turn and finished
well to take third late while gaining on the top two. YOUTHINKTHATSFUNNY settled off the pace, contested at a close disadvantage in the three path of the
far turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. RIVER CROSROAD RVF settled off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole
and raced at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn, then weakened past the eighth pole. POTENTIAL GRIZZLY showed little response. COWBOY
AT HEART tapered in to stalk off the rail, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but gave way past the five sixteenths.

ONE MORE FACTOR took a quick lead and set a well reserved pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the
rail and held well under steady stretch handling. MIDNIGHT SHIFT rounded the opening turn in the five path and settled off the pace leaving the turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in range off the rail on the far turn but had to settle for second best. SAN ANTONE broke outward to make
contact with Sunman then rated off the pace about the three path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at
the rail, angled to the three path into the lane but showed little further. SHAMELESS RISK saved ground well off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole
and improved in the four path of the far turn, though, showed little further. SUNMAN was jostled at the break and raced well off the pace in the three and
four paths the first turn, then bid only mildly leaving the three eighths pole. E J'S REVENGE broke in to make contact with Sunman then saved ground,
picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail into the far turn then weakened. TOM TERRIFIC raced close to the early pace, gave
chase from the nine sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
MISS GRANDSTANDER took the lead leaving the chute and set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the turn, was steadily handled to late stretch then
taken in hand nearing the wire. TOY TIGER gave chase, raced close in the two and three paths of the turn, drifted into the stretch and couldn't gain. MARY
BOPPINS TOO gave chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail and ran evenly in the lane. LIL MISS FIBER gave early chase but raced boxed in from the
three eighths pole to the quarter pole, recovered stride in the three path of the turn and ran evenly through the lane. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW gave chase,
rounded the turn about the three path and showed little more. MOJO MATTERS gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly in the stretch.
THISLILLIMEOFMINE chased toward the outside, came through the turn about the five path and showed little more. FLYING SOFIA gave chase outside,
raced in the six path of the turn and never factored. STRATUSFACTION became edgy in the gate and was consequently, unprepared for the start.
SINGING HARMONY chased, steadied nearing the quarter pole then weakened at the rail on the turn. The Stewards reviewed the start of this race.
