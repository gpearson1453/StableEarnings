Footnotes
KING T'CHALLA was hustled up inside approaching the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, came through the turn at the rail and was steadily
handled in the stretch. HURRICANE AMIGO was jostled hard at the start then chased outside, rounded the turn in the six path and dug in from the head of
the lane to take second later yards. TEMPESTA chsaed through the backstretch, ran in the three path of the turn and flattened the final furlong. ASCENDED
came out at the start and made contact with ROCKING TO HOME on the chute then pressured the pace, but dropped back approaching the quarter pole
and flattened at the rail on the turn. The latter broke outward to make contact with Hurricane Amigo and was bumped from the inside a stride later, gave
chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn near the rail. BUDDYBOYSGOTSENSE gave chase then flattened in the three path of the turn.
WAYNE'S HOPE broke inward to make contact with Hurricane Amigo then kept in check throughout the race, left the turn widest and was eased while
lugging in.

Footnotes
SHE FIGURES settled back off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn just off the rail, angled four wide
leaving the turn and dug in to get up at the wire. CAROLINA BAMBINA rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn near the rail, dug in to steady encouragement through the final furlong but was nipped under the wire. BOCA BIRDIE saved ground
racing well back, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the turn in the three and four paths, eased to the outside leaving the turn and closed
well to take third the final strides while gaining on the top two. DANCE LIGHTLY tapered in and stalked the pace two deep, challenged at the three eighths
pole but dropped back off the rail midway on the far turn and flattened stride later yards. CHIT CHAT GIRL rated close to the early pace off the rail, picked
up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened inside the eighth pole. LIFE IN FLASH saved ground
well back, angled out nearing the top of the lane and left the far turn widest. I AM I WILL saved ground off the pace, gave chase from the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn near the rail then weakened. The three quarter fraction was hand timed.

HANDSOME JOANIE gave chase and took aim in the three path nearing the top of the stretch, lugged in a path past the eighth pole then widened the final
sixteenth. EXCUSES EXCUSES gave chase and raced close two deep on the turn, steadied at the inside flank of Handsome Joanie leaving the eighth pole
but quickly recovered stride to re-take second in later yards. MAGNIFICENT ROCKET chased toward the inside, raced near the rail on the turn, angled to
the six path leaving the turn and finished well to take third the final yards. TRIPLE GALA chased inside, raced close at the rail on the turn, was hemmed in
from the eighth pole to mid-stretch, though, finished evenly. MARLEESBEEBEE accelerated to the lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole and rated
the pace, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the turn but was caught mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. STONES ROAD chased off the
rail, steadied from a narrowing opening between horses past the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn off the rail, angled to the outside leaving the turn and
showed little more. LA CUBANA gave chase outside, raced in the three path of the turn and showed little in the lane. The Stewards posted the inquiry to

BULL MEECHUM contested the early pace and took the lead two deep past the quarter pole, edged clear nearing mid-stretch and was steadily handled to
hold on well. REMYS SHOWTIME chased inside, lacked room and steadied into the turn, eased to the three path through the turn then dueled the length of
the stretch and took second late yards. DERBY DAY DREAMS gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four path and was outfinished in
the stretch duel for second. JUNGLE BEAST chased outside, rounded the turn about the six path and finished evenly. FIBER STRONG contested the early
pace, yielded the edge past the quarter pole, dueled close from that point but dropped back toward mid-stretch and flattened stride. TRUFFLES AND GOLD
chased inside, rounded the turn just off the rail then weakened inside the eighth pole. NAUTICAL WARRIOR gave chase inside, raced near the rail on the
turn and showed little in the lane. ROCKET SOUND was never a factor and rounded the turn about the six path.

SHERWOOD LADY engaged in close chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and dug in from the head of the lane to get up the
final yards. NELLYSFORD set a pressured pace inside, contested the rail on the turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was caught in the
final yards. WINDSOR'S CHAMPION pressured the pace inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened stride the final sixteenth. CHEESE LOUISE gave
chase, rounded the turn two deep and ran evenly in the lane. LUNAR PRAYER gave chase, ran in the three path of the turn then flattened later yards.
COUNTRY MAGIC saved ground. CLUBIN TILL DAWN gave chase and rounded the turn about the five path.
