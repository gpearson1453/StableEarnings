Footnotes
RED DIAMOND tracked off the rail then moved inside while taking closer order leaving the backstretch, tipped two wide around the bend, took aim at the
leader entering the stretch, bid outside and gained command at the eighth pole, drifted out a bit and drew clear in the final sixteenth. AVENTAPP away
quickly to gain command, cleared past the half-mile pole, roused late on the turn, challenged in upper stretch, lost the lead with a furlong to go while drifting
out and ran on for a clear second. SPRING SPINNING kept moving her head around and was unprepared when the gates opened, stumbled soon after the
start, advanced along the inside through the turn, could not threaten the top pair but bested the rest. MISSING PENNY showed early speed between rivals,
raced greenly crossing the dirt, chased past the half-mile pole, got shuffled between runners on the turn, angled to the inside and kept on for a minor award.
DARLING DONNA showed early speed outside a pair of rivals then chased leaving the backstretch, remained off the rail to the stretch and weakened. DIAL
HER broke slow in the beginning, tracked outside a rival at the back, went three wide into the turn, tipped four wide around the bend then steered back to
the two path and failed to make an impact.

AREA CODE set the pace under pressure on the inside, dueled with MAGNIFICENT RIDE around the turn and into the stretch, battled through the final
furlong and dug in late to inch ahead of the runner-up. MAGNIFICENT RIDE stumbled badly leaving the gate, recovered quickly to show speed from
outside, drifted in and bothered rivals early, headed rival midway around the turn, dueled into and down the stretch and was bested by the winner.
HEAVEN'S MUSIC steadied off the heels of the pacesetter early, angled out off the rail, went three wide around the turn, steered out in the lane and finished
willingly, gaining outside the top pair late. MR FREEBIE floated in by outside rival and brushed with GRAZEN SUN early, continued to press the pace
between rivals then got shuffled between rivals at the three-eighths pole, chased a bit off the rail then two wide into the stretch and could not rally. GRAZEN
SUN was off slow to begin, hustled early and tried to go between rivals but got squeezed, clipped heels and had to check hard early, trailed three to four
wide on the turn and could not rally. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED MAGNIFICENT RIDE FROM SECOND TO LAST FOR
DRIFTING IN AND FLOATING MR FREEBIE INTO GRAZEN SUN EARLY, CAUSING GRAZEN SUN TO CLIP HEELS AND CHECK BADLY WHICH
COST HIM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

INCREASE STAKES broke alertly and cleared quickly, crossed over to the inside, took some mild pressure from YOUTE on the turn but cleared that rival
around the bend, inched away in the drive under urging and led clear into the deep stretch, then held off the second challenge from YOUTE in the closing
moments. YOUTE broke a bit slow from inside, sent to a forward position to the outside of the pacesetter, put in a mild bid on the turn but could not keep up
around the bend, chased two wide into the stretch, re-bid from outside in the closing moments but was too late. ROSE MADDOX was off a bit slow to begin,
angled to the inside, tipped two wide around the bend, steered out in the stretch then drifted late while offering a mild late rally. SQUARED SHADY was a bit
fractious in the gate, stalked from outside, three wide around the turn, moved out in the lane and lacked a bid. TRIBAL BID stumbled badly at the start,
steadied a bit off heels early, saved ground through the turn, tipped out in the stretch and could not rally. TIME FOR EBBY tossed her head at the start but
did not lose much at the start, got shuffled between rivals early and dropped back, trailed two wide then a bit off the rail into the stretch and had little left.

Footnotes
MICRO SHARE broke a bit slow, stalked the top pair to the far turn, split rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, took over quickly at the quarter pole, kicked clear
from BROCADE and drew off under hand urging. BROCADE broke out a bit at the start, chased in the two path around the first turn, moved up to duel for
command in the middle stages, cleared at the three-eighths pole and moved to the rail, overtaken by the winner at the quarter pole, moved out in the stretch
and stayed on to secure the place. CHLOE'S GIRL broke well from inside, took control then was rated early, dueled with BROCADE up the backstretch, lost
contact with that rival with three furlong remaining, tipped two wide on the far turn, proved no match in the stretch run but churned on for the show honors.
SWEET TALKED was off a bit slow from outside, stalked off the rail then outside the winner, asked three wide around the second bend and weakened.
HAPPY HAPPY broke slow and lost her path at the start, steered to the inside trailing the field, lagged behind up the backstretch, moved off the rail on the
far turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
DREAM ROBBER sent for the lead from inside, set the pace with ME LIKEY to the outside, cleared that rival with a quarter mile left to run and drew off in
the final sixteenth. ME LIKEY away quickly in the beginning, prompted the pace from outside, lost contact with the leader near the quarter pole, continued to
give chase within striking distance in the drive, then flattened a bit late but saved the place. KIMMER chased off the rail, angled to the rail on the turn then
steered back out past the five-sixteenths pole, altered from behind a rival at the eighth pole and finished well to miss second. SOMETIMES ALWAYS
traveled in range off the rail then outside a rival, rounded the turn three wide and could not produce a bid. CATFISH CHARLIE chased the top pair to the
turn, traveled along the inside into the turn, tried to drifted but was being kept inside by the rider, raced two wide into the lane and weakened. MUSICAL
GEM dropped back early, coaxed four wide through the turn and could not rally.

Footnotes
EXCELERINA (IRE) settled in the two path, roused while angled out on the far turn, challenged four wide entering the stretch, took over and cleared in
upper stretch, then drew away under hand urging and costed in late. POP POP'S DREAM broke a bit slow and shifted inward at the start, tracked along the
inside early, eased out to the three path around the second turn, came out in upper stretch and got up for second. ANNAGHLASA (IRE) broke out and
bumped rival, stalked in range early on, bid three deep leaving the far turn, could not kick on with the winner in the furlong grounds and was outfinished for
second. SPLIT THEN DOUBLE (GB) controlled the pace in the early going, led clear to the quarter pole, challenged leaving the turn, yielded in upper stretch
and weakened. OCTANE (BRZ) stalked the pace outside a rival, asked two wide around the far turn, bid between into the stretch and flattened. ZYDECO
MAMA got bumped leaving the gate, raced off the rail then moved into the two path on the first turn, checked behind a rival at the seven-sixteenths pole,
angled out into the stretch and could not rally. DERBY QUEST tracked two then three wide on the first turn, got floated out by ZYDECO MAMA into the
stretch, steered to the inside in the stretch and failed to menace. FAIRY CAKES (GB) was off slow to begin, moved to the inside under a hold, roused
around the far turn, came off the rail in the drive and faded.

Footnotes
FENESTRA raced up close early, bid outside the leader in the two path on the turn, took over in upper stretch, cleared with a furlong remaining and was
kept to task to the line. I'M CORFU showed good early foot from inside, controlled the pace up the backstretch, got pressured by FENESTRA on the turn,
lost command in upper stretch and stayed on well from inside. FURY KAP raced in range up the backstretch, rounded the turn three wide, drifted in at the
eighth pole, lacked the needed response but bested the rest. MISTER BOLD stalked along the inside, chased a bit off the rail into the stretch and could not
off the needed response. THE RULE OF KING'S hopped at the start, trailed up the backstretch, angled to the rail on the turn and was never a factor. QUICK
FINISH chased four wide into the turn, moved into the three path around the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
EVENING SUN (GB) unhurried in the early going and moved inside, tipped to the two path around the clubhouse turn, began to pull leaving the first turn
then had to steady past the five-eighths pole, settled into stride and moved to the inside, steered out around the far turn and came three wide into the
stretch, closed through the stretch and drew alongside TIZ PLUS past the sixteenth pole and got up under urging. TIZ PLUS set the pace and moved inside,
showed the way with rivals to the outside up the backstretch, cleared and inched away on the second bend, continued clear into midstretch and got run
down late. ANACONDA showed early quickness from outside, got floated five wide entering the clubhouse turn then dropped back and angled down to the
two path, traveled in mid-pack outside a rival up the backstretch, came three wide into the stretch, advanced two then three wide on the far turn but faltered
in the late stages. COMRADERY (IRE) broke slow and bobbled at the start, trailed in the early going, came out on far turn and steered out further to race
widest in the stretch and showed a mild rally for a minor award. CREW DRAGON raced up close between early then was taken back prior to the clubhouse
turn and steered to the inside, got put in tight along the rail and checked at the three-eighths pole, remained inside to the stretch, tipped out in the lane and
could not rally. EASTERN OCEAN broke alertly, drifted out into the first turn, stalked up close outside the leader, got put in tight and checked at the
three-eighths pole, angled to the rail around the far turn and flattened. HUDSON RIDGE got floated out entering the first turn, attended the pace three deep,
chased the leader in the two path between rivals leaving the far turn and weakened.
