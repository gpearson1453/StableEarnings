of the lane to take the lead later yards and held on driving. TOMMY PIES saved early ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on
the far turn, angled to the four path into the stretch, dug in for second late yards and was gaining on the winner. BUSHIDO'S WAY rated the pace inside,
came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn but was caught flattening stride late yards. PERTH AMBOY was
pinched back at the break then saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened in the
lane. THE DON OF SQUAN rounded the opening turn about the five path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, continued in the five path of the
far turn and passed rivals. LUNAR IMAGE entered the first turn in the five path, gave chase from the three eighths pole but flattened off the rail on the far
turn. ZIP THE LIP broke inward to make contact with Perth Amboy then settled off the pace three wide on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven

the backstretch, showed little response from the three eighths pole, weakened at the rail on the far turn and was eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
ROCK FILE saved ground through the opening turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, closed three wide on the far turn, took the lead at the eighth
pole and widened under steady handling. MIKI settled back off the rail on the first turn, bid into the backstretch, ran in the three path of the far turn, swung to
the seven path entering the stretch and finished evenly while dueling for second mid-stretch. BLUE COLLAR BOY stalked inside the first turn, picked up the
chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, angled four wide into the stretch and finished evenly. CHAMPAGNE JAM raced well
back early, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the six and seven paths and passed rivals outside. NORMANDY'S EMPIRE took the
lead at the rail into the first turn and raced at even terms through the turn, dueled from the seven sixteenths pole still mostly at even terms with LASHER but
was caught nearing the head of the lane and weakened the final furlong. While the latter led through the front stretch and raced at even terms through the
first turn, dueled from the seven sixteenths pole and alternated the lead with Normandy's Empire from that point, contested the far turn two deep then
weakened the final eighth. FOURDIAMONDSPLEASE rounded the opening turn in the four path, left the turn outside then bid toward the seven sixteenths
pole, steadied into the far turn and showed little further. HUCKLEBERRY FRIEND rounded the first turn about the five path, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole but faded past the five sixteenths. The three quarter fraction was hand timed.
