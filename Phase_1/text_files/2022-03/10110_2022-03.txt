Footnotes
GLORY ROLL broke sharply, conceded the lead to a rival, then tracked just off that foe a bit off the inside racing to the turn, continued with a steady bid to
wrest command racing into upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. KENAI COOL tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing to
the turn, continued with a steady effort in that path to the stretch and proved best of the others. ROLLING MO, off slowly, settled last while shifting inwards,
switched outside foes on the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and continued with interest to gain some position. TALE OF V K tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight, angled out four wide nearing upper stretch carrying out ROLLING MO but offered no rally. MISS UNDERSTANDING
angled inwards tracking the leaders as part of the second flight into the turn, then faded between rivals near the inside racing into upper stretch. MISS
MARGARET ANN was hustled to gain the lead outside the eventual winner in the opening stages, angled to the rail once gaining the advantage, set the
pace through the bend but gave out abruptly once headed by the winner.

Footnotes
LYRICAL, forwardly placed along the rail attending the pace, steadied out of tight quarters approaching the turn, continued with a steady effort along the
inside on the turn, came through inside the leaders to wrest command racing into upper stretch, made the balance of the pace under a few right handed
taps and was taken in hand approaching the wire. CSILLA tracked off the first flight between foes in early stages, was held up avoiding tight quarters
nearing the turn, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late effort to prove best of the others. TAMIAMI, forwardly placed
three wide attending the pace, pressed the issue between foes on the turn to midstretch but weakened late while finishing well enough to earn a share, then
was vanned off the course following the race. CATIRUSIA tracked the leaders along the inside behind the second flight on the backstretch, was in hand
momentarily while switching outside some traffic nearing the turn, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. ROYAL ATHENA, urged
between foes dictating the pace through the backstretch, angled inwards racing into the turn disputing the issue inside foes, then gave way between rivals
leaving the furlong marker. AUBURN hopped at the start breaking last, switched outside rivals racing through the backstretch, continued four wide into the
turn and lacked the needed closing bid. ASPROPODIA, a bit outpaced in early stages, was fanned six wide into the stretch while failing to seriously
threaten.

Footnotes
TAKE ME AS I AM broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the rail to the backstretch, continued in that path into the far turn,
turned back a challenge from LA VIEXA racing into upper stretch and kicked away late under firm right handed encouragement. The latter, pulling a bit
inside foes tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, was urged to advance along the rail bidding for command inside the pacesetter nearing the
quarter mile marker, switched outside that foe when losing some ground racing into upper stretch and proved no match late. ME SAY SO was rated off the
first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, angled inwards nearing the second bend, saved ground through the far turn and edged a rival for a share
in the closing stages. KEITANY tracked just off the leaders three wide between foes racing to the backstretch, angled inwards racing into the far turn while
being prompted in pursuit of the leaders outside a rival to the stretch but lacked the needed late bid. SPRITE'S LADY settled last along the inside racing to
the backstretch, saved ground throughout and passed inside some tiring rivals late. SILVER PACKAGE was settled outside foes in the opening stages, was
prompted to gain contention while being caught four wide racing to the backstretch, lodged a brief bid in that path nearing the far turn but quickly came up
empty. TIZ LOTTIE, forwardly placed between foes prompting the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, faded three deep between foes racing into the far
turn.

Footnotes
MAGICGIRL, in touch with the leaders three deep racing past the chute, was taken back to last racing into the bend while shifting to the inside, was
prompted to advance along the rail nearing upper stretch, bid for command inside the pacesetter leaving the furlong marker and gained a narrow advantage
in time under firm right handed pressure. FREE TO FLY, urged inside foes disputing the pace through the backstretch, then into the turn, tipped off the
inside in upper stretch gaining a clear advantage, resisted the winner's bid but just failed to contain that foe. LET'S BE HONEST broke readily to race on
terms with the leaders nearing the chute, was eased off the pace in the second furlong, continued four wide into the turn, then advanced in that path through
the stretch to close the gap on the top pair late. SHE DAZZLE settled near the inside in the opening stages, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch to
bid between foes but lacked the needed final bid. MS. MALEVOLENCE, urged between foes disputing the pace, dueled outside a rival to midstretch and
gave way. PLUIE D'AVRIL was rated off the second flight racing off the inside to the turn and never gained contention. HASTY LADY stumbled at the start,
then threw her head when coming under some correction from her rider, was urged to press the pace four wide through the backstretch and gave way
racing into the bend.

Footnotes
STONY POINT broke readily, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace racing to the bend, was headed nearing upper stretch but kept on to regain the
advantage entering the lane, then kicked away from her rivals under mild hand urging to prove best. HONOR THAT, bumped at the start, recovered to track
off the first flight three wide between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn, switched out three wide racing through the stretch
and continued with interest to secure the place honors. TREVISE broke inwards bumping HONOR THAT at the start, was collected, then switched out five
wide on the backstretch while coming under prompting to advance, loomed outside the leaders three deep nearing upper stretch to strike the front but failed
to sustain that momentum through the final stages. CANDY JAR tracked just off the first flight inside foes on the backstretch, dropped back racing into the
turn, saved ground on the turn, then shifted out racing through the stretch to improve position between foes. AMAZING GRACES JOY angled inwards while
moving to press the pace between foes from the outset into the turn and gave way racing through upper stretch. BE LIKE WATER tracked off the first flight
four wide between foes in the opening stages, continued in pursuit of the leaders in that path to upper stretch and gave way. LOOKING FOR LOVE, slow
into stride, proved no threat. JOYOUS FAIRY TALE tracked the pace between foes in second flight but dropped out early.

Footnotes
MAGICAL WARRIOR was urged forcing the pace outside a rival on the backstretch to the turn, shook clear nearing upper stretch and was kept to pressure.
TOUGH TO TAME tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, tipped out to the three path in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on
the winner to the end. KILLARGUE'S GIRL settled outside a rival in the last flight racing through the backstretch, angled out entering the stretch and
continued with interest to prevail for a share between foes at the wire. CONDEMNATION tracked off the first flight three deep in early stages, was urged to
lodge a bid in that path nearing upper stretch, was fanned four wide entering the lane and faded in late stages. IMPERIAL BIRD, urged disputing the pace
inside the eventual winner through the backstretch into the turn, gave way nearing upper stretch. VIVA VICTORY was settled in the last flight along the
inside racing to the turn, shifted out entering the lane but never gained contention. KWAI CHANG tracked off the first flight inside rivals racing into the turn,
was taken in hand when caught behind a tiring foe approaching the quarter mile marker, then continued in hand along the inside when shuffled back out of
close quarters racing through the stretch.

Footnotes
JUST PLAIN ORNERY bobbled at the start, was quickly righted to attend a rival's pace on the backstretch, pressed the issue nearing upper stretch to wrest
the advantage in the lane and went clear under firm left handed encouragement. GOLD SPECIAL tracked just off the leaders inside foes racing to the turn,
saved ground to upper stretch, then advanced inside foes to prevail narrowly for the place honors. BUBBA DREAMS, urged inside a rival disputing the pace
through the backstretch into the turn, tipped off the inside racing into upper stretch and weakened late. AGENT COOPER tracked the leaders between foes
in second flight racing into the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and continued evenly while exchanging some light contact with BUBBA DREAMS
in the closing stages. MELINA'S DREAM tracked just off the second flight three wide between foes racing to the turn and continued evenly to late stages.
MENELAO settled last early and failed to menace thereafter. LAYNES KNIGHT tracked off the first flight three wide racing to the turn, then gave way into
upper stretch.

Footnotes
J D'S VISTA was settled between foes in the last flight in the opening stages, angled out five wide racing past the half mile marker, commenced a steady
rally in that path racing through the turn, shifted inwards under pressure brushing TOURING EGYPT near midstretch but continued with solid late
momentum to go clear. TOURING EGYPT tracked off the first flight outside rivals racing to the turn, was urged to challenge in the four path racing into upper
stretch, was brushed racing past the furlong marker but kept on to prevail for the place honors. THE JOKES ON ME broke sharply, angled to the rail racing
past the chute setting the pace, conceded the lead in the second quarter to track the leaders along the inside, produced a second effort to bid for command
inside rivals in upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. CATCH THE RAINBOW angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the turn and
continued evenly in late stages. TAP SOLO switched outside the pacesetter, then was urged between foes disputing the pace through the backstretch,
continued to duel for command inside a rival off the rail through the turn to upper stretch and gave way between rivals late. LADY MANHATTAN, off a bit
slowly, was switched off the inside in early stages but proved no threat. ADRIANA ES BONITA tracked off the second flight racing four wide to the turn and
gave way after a half. THAWED joined the pace three wide in early stages, pressed the issue racing into the turn and gave way after a half. MISCHIEF
REIGNS hesitated at the start losing position to the field and proved no factor. BETH DUTTON was steadied out of tight quarters between foes leaving the
chute and dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND THE RUN THROUGH THE
STRETCH BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
SWIFT KID was settled between foes dropping well off the leaders racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail approaching the far turn, came around a tiring
foe nearing upper stretch, then rallied to the front inside foes to prevail in time under steady handling. ANALYZEYOURVISION tracked off the first flight
under light rating along the inside to the backstretch, gained position between foes just off the inside nearing the far turn, advanced inside a rival on the far
turn to wrest a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner's late bid. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA was rated behind the second flight
along the inside to the backstretch, tipped off the rail on the far turn, shifted to three path racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to gain a
share. THE SKIPSTER ducked outwards leaving the chute bumping PLEASANT VALUE, was urged forcing the pace outside a rival through the first turn to
the backstretch, continued to press the issue into upper stretch but gave way late. ASSERT DOMINANCE settled into stride off the inside racing to the
backstretch, gathered some momentum racing into the far turn, was caught five wide nearing upper stretch and continued evenly in that path to late stages.
PLEASANT VALUE, bumped by THE SKIPSTER, then forced into the path of NEPTUNES REVENGE leaving the chute, was righted to track off the first
flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was urged to lodge a brief bid three wide between foes racing through the far turn but came up empty racing
into the stretch. BLACK LIMO was rated off the second flight to the backstretch, made brief progress advancing on the leaders four wide into the far turn but
emptied out abruptly in the drive. HIS WILL BE DONE was urged to the lead along the inside leaving the chute, disputed the pace inside a rival through the
backstretch and gave way abruptly racing into the far turn. LITTLE BUD never proved a serious factor. NEPTUNES REVENGE, bumped leaving the chute,
drifted wide approaching the first turn and, soon dropped out. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
INCIDENT LEAVING THE CHUTE AND DISQUALIFIED THE SKIPSTER FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM LAST.
