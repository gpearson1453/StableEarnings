Footnotes
INCLUDE HOO Taken back and trailed into the first turn, showed steady gain from half-mile pole into the far turn, made a bold, three-wide bid outside of
dueling leaders and was driven out to a solid victory. DEMERARA Sent and dueled outside from the break all the way to the quarter pole, looked to be
dropping back but re-rallied at the eighth pole to best the rest. WINDI'S MOMENT Made the lead early and dueled inside from the break up until the quarter
pole, took a narrow advantage into the far turn but tired in lane. EBB AND FLOW Tracked well off the pace and lost touch with the rest of the field up the
backstretch, commenced rally at quarter pole and showed late interest until ultimately missing third on the bob.
