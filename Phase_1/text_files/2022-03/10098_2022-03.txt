Footnotes
OAK HILL LG took a mild bump from an outer rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, inched clear entering the lane, tired while asked to shift out a
path in the final sixteenth, but lasted to the wire. MAGIC LIGHTNING stalked inside of rivals while in the two path, chased from outside of the clear leader
through the lane while hanging on his left lead, gained late as that foe tired, but missed reeling him in on the wire. FORTY THREE tracked in the four to
three path around the turn, then chased the top two from the outside through the lane. FREED chased in the three path around the turn, drifted to the five
path entering the lane, and tired. CHECKULATER failed to factor. FIGHTING SOLDIER bumped an inner foe at the start, and was outrun.

Footnotes
VARSITY FLYGIRL leaned inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, set the pace inside of a rival while a path off of the rail, drew clear t the five furlong pole,
shifted out to the four path approaching the lane to float a bidding ANGEL OF VERDUN wider, then drifted out in upper stretch, in at the furlong grounds as
an inner rival bid, then back out while flopping back to his left lead approaching the final sixteenth, and held. ANGEL OF VERDUN tracked two wide, ranged
up in the four path to engage the leader turning for home, got floated out and came into the lane in the six path, but leveled off, flopped back to his left lead
at the furlong grounds while chasing, then switched back to his right lead a sixteenth later, and stayed on to reach place on the wire. GLANCE tracked along
the inside, stalked around the far turn, bid for the lead inside of the wandering leader at the furlong grounds, vied into the final sixteenth but flattened out
late, and got nailed on the wire for place. HAVINFUNYET trailed, shifted from the three path to the five path entering the lane, and moved up. NORTHERN
ALLIANCE pressed the leader from the three path early on, backed off to stalk at the five furlong pole, then chased from between horses around the far turn
before fading. CALAJA was nudged by an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, and made little impact.

Footnotes
SPEAK TO ME prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses at the five sixteenths pole, gained an advantage while tipping to the four path entering the
lane, and drew clear while shifting in passing the furlong pole. HALFGLAMOROUS tracked two wide, shifted three wide entering the lane, and stayed on
between horses to claim place inside the final furlong. GIRL IN BLACK stalked three wide, ranged up at the five sixteenths pole, but flattened out while
getting floated to the five path entering the lane, then held show. EPONHER broke half a step slowly, raced off of the pace along the inside, and failed to
factor. KASEN'S SISTER set the pace, met a pair of outer bids at the five sixteenths pole, got headed at the quarter pole, and tired.
THETRUTHISTHETRUTH stalked along the inside, but failed to slip through a very narrow rail seam through the lane. THE MISSING PIECE broke
outwardly, trailed in the four path around the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
HEALS THE SOUL broke inwardly, rushed to clear in the opening quarter, showed the way via a large lead in the three path around the turn, shifted further
out for better ground approaching midstretch, and lasted safely under mild urging. SUN STRIKER chased along the inside while a path off of the rail around
the turn, shifted out in upper stretch to claim place from an outer SPANKHURST, and kept that foe at bay through the final furlong for that position.
SPANKHURST bobbled at the start, chased in midpack in the six path around the turn, vied for place with an inner rival in upper stretch, but was denied that
position through the final furlong. BERNIE SPECIAL hopped at the start and bumped the inner part of the bate, trailed the field around the turn, swung to the
outer part of the track entering the lane, and moved up while on better ground. FEDERAL EXCHANGE broke outwardly, raced far back in the two path
around the turn, came into the lane in the four path, and improved between horsres in upper stretch. SWEET DREAMS BABE raced far back in the three
path and never got involved. KIDYOUNOT tracked in the three path, cut to the two path entering the lane, but tired. GOLDEN V C stalked in the five path,
then weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ANICLUDE settled far back in the two path, then in the five path around the far turn, swung to the eight path entering the lane, rallied outside of foes to bid
at the sixteenths pole, and forged an advantage late. MR. PETERKIN tracked from midpack in the two path, split the leading pair in the four path in upper
stretch, cleared leaving the three sixteenths pole, but failed to kick on to the wire, and got bested in the final sixteenth. FILIPPO tracked four wide, then from
the five path around the far turn, shifted to the seven path entering the lane, grinded away between horses to bid for show at the sixteenth pole after getting
outkicked by the eventual winner, then prevailed for that position. GUNNER PAUL stalked three wide, then in the four path around the far turn, came into the
lane in the six path, shifted course inwardly after an inner foe drifted into his path, stayed on between horses to bid for show at the sixteenth pole, but did not
have enough to reach an outer rival for that position. HOT STOVE LEAGUE prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead in the three path at the five
sixteenths pole, led in the five path entering the lane, but was outkicked by an inner foe in upper stretch, drifted a bit outwardly soon after, and yielded
between horses at the furlong grounds. RONITHELIMODRIVER moved just before the gates opened and came out slowly, raced off of the pace in the three
path, shifted inwardly entering the lane, but lacked a rail kick. OKUDAH set the pace along the inside, got headed by an outer foe at the five sixteenths pole
while taking the far turn in the two path, shifted to the three path entering the lane, and weakened. RUNNER got antsy awaiting the start, then was outrun.

Footnotes
CYPRIANO tracked in the three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, rallied to bid at the sixteenth pole, and edged an advantage at the wire.
GOLD PUNCH set a clear pace in the two path, held sway through upper stretch, came under a drive entering the final sixteenth, met CYPRIANO's
challenge entering the final sixteenth, and got nailed at the wire. CRYPTOZONIC raced far back along the inside, then stayed on while chasing the main
group from the rail, and reached an outer rival for show on the wire. WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG stalked along the inside around the turn, altered course to
the three path to be outside of the leader at the three sixteenths pole, but failed to progress, got outkicked by an outer rival for place leaving the furlong
grounds, yielded, then was nailed on the wire by an inner foe for show. BITSY'S CUSTOM C tracked in midpack in the four path, failed to keep pace in the
six path while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, then changed over entering the final furlong, but failed to rally. G DON'T KNOW raced far back two
wide and never got involved. GRIEF was outrun. NO HEAD-ON REPLAY SHOWN.

Footnotes
RISKY REWARD prompted the pace two wide and in the three path around the turn, got floated to the six path entering the lane as MOM'S RED LIPSTICK
ranged up, led between horses at the three sixteenths pole, and held gamely from her outer challenger to the wire while hanging on her left lead. MOM'S
RED LIPSTICK laid off of the pace two wide into the turn, gained in the four path around the turn to range up to the leading pair while fanning to the seven
path entering the lane, produced a bid outside of RISKY REWARD in midstretch, but was fended off, and missed reaching that rival late. READY FOR
CHANGE prompted the pace three wide early on, but failed to keep pace into the turn, took the bend in the five path and retreated to trail the field at the five
sixteenths pole, then swung to the nine path in upper stretch, and stayed on to reach show late. DANCE RHYTHMS set the pace inside of a pressing rival
while in the two path around the turn, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, but yielded to a pair of outer rivals at the furlong grounds, and lost show
late. INAJIFFY laid off of the pace along the inside, and was outrun through the lane.

Footnotes
STEELY DANZA prompted the pace three wide, bid in the four path entering the lane, and drew off in upper stretch. JOYFUL CANDY stalked in the two
path, gained place passing the furlong grounds, and was second best. DR. BENNY tracked in midpack in the four path, came into the lane in the five path,
got herded to the seven path while staying on, and reached show at the wire. HERMS CROWN set the pace in the two path, proved no match for an outer
bidding foe approaching the three sixteenths pole, then drifted outwardly at the furlong grounds while tiring, and got nailed for show. COOL RUNNINGS laid
off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the seven path in upper stretch, but failed to threaten. T G'S NELSON raced far back in the five path and made
little impact. CO CONSPIRATOR laid close up inside of the pace setter early on, but weakened in upper stretch. GRAN MUCHACO never got involved.
GOROSTIETA'S LOVE raced off the pace inside, saved ground, but to no avail. I'M A FLASHY KID showed little.
