LEADER OF THE BAND stalked the dueling leaders, took over at the five sixteenths pole drew away under wraps. ARGENTINA GIRL lost his right iron
briefly at the break, forced the pace outside, led into the far turn, dueled the winner then weakened. CLOUD SKIPPING made a brief bid outside on the final
turn then flattened out. AMATERASU saved ground well off the pace and was never in contention. LA LA LUCY trailed far behind then passed a fading rival.
HAY BUCK raced inside and gave way readily losing contact with her field.

clear under urging. TWIXY CAT chased on the inside, angled out at the quarter pole, rallied two wide into the stretch, bid outside R GOODTIME CHARLIE
at the eighth pole, dug in gamely but second best. R GOODTIME CHARLIE vied inside for the lead, shook free nearing the quarter pole, dug in gamely in
the lane and held on for third. HIZAAM was outrun early, advanced on the turn, moved up behind rivals in upper stretch, then rallied mildly outside late.

not factor. FAST NEGOTIATIONS vied two wide for the lead, chased on the turn and faded. ROCKIN COWBOY stalked three wide, chased on the turn,

VINE JET settled in the two path early, was asked for run on the final turn then wore down the leaders inside through the final furlong. NONEEDTOWORRY
lagged far behind, advanced five wide on the final turn, bid, loomed a threat but was outfinished. TURNPIKE BOB led outside early, moved clear before the
half, widened on the final turn, was collared in the stretch but continued willingly. NIMITZ forced the pace early along the inside, angled out and came up
empty in the stretch. EPIC LUCK settled off the pace inside within range then stopped in the stretch. HOTPOT was urged close up outside for three furlongs
and gave way readily.

RUNNINSONOFAGUN pursued the loose pacesetter outside, bid on the turn, collared the pacesetter and drew of then was geared down late. CENTER
MID MADDIE quickly moved clear in hand, was collared into the stretch and continued willingly. ALLEVARE dropped back early, advanced three wide and
closed well without threatening. OUR SHOT lacked speed, raced between rivals and lacked a rally. UNCLE GARY G prompted the pace briefly wide, was
asked for run at the 3/8 pole but had no response. TALENTED MAN saved ground off the leaders and was never in contention. KENNER raced in the two
path then inside and faded on the turn. MASROUR chased four wide down the backstretch, stopped and lost contact with his field.

I AM REDEEMED vied inside for the lead, dueled with DEPOSITORY on the far turn, briefly shook free, turned back a bid from YOU MUST CHILL in the
stretch run and drew clear late. YOU MUST CHILL tracked close up on the inside, tracked the leaders on the far turn, rallied two wide into the stretch, bid
outside of I AM REDEEMED, dueled and came up second best. OLYMPIC ROMP raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn, weakened and
held on to win the show photo. SHOOGER RAY TOO raced three wide off the pace, four wide at the half mile, went five wide on the far turn, closed mildly
and just missed for third. MIDNIGHT ACT raced off the pace between rivals, chased on the far turn and had no rally. DEPOSITORY raced four wide early,
vied outside for the lead, dueled with the winner on the far turn and faded. HIBACHI was reluctant loading, stalked between rivals, chased three wide on the
far turn and gave way. PRINCE OF RAIN raced four wide early, stalked three wide, chased four wide on the far turn and gave way.

BRAZEN dueled inside, repelled that rival, was challenged again in midstretch and fought back gamely to narrowly prevail.. SNEAKINESS well placed
behind the dueling leaders, bid into the stretch, battled and lost the head bob. FOREST FIRE far back early, advanced along the rail and finished strongly.
SEVIER vied with winner outside to the stretch then weakened slightly. TOWN JAK chased inside within range then flattened out in the stretch.
JAMMINWITHBRANDON raced in the clear outside but lacked a rally. MANAHAWKIN dropped far behind and was never in contention. GLACIER
EXPRESS lagged far behind throughout and was always outrun.

SIR ALFRED JAMES raced two wide off the pace, moved up on the turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, closed the gap, altered course to the two
path near the sixteenth marker, surged late and was up in time. ROCK ON LUKE was a bit fractious in the gate, set the pace on the inside, shook free at the
top of the lane, dug in gamely, drifted back to the rail past midstretch and was caught in the final strides. WENDELL FONG raced off the pace inside,
chased inside on the turn, angled out and closed late between rivals. PRESS MY BETS pressed the pace racing outside of ROCK ON LUKE, bid on the
turn, dug in gamely in upper stretch and weakened late. SMOOTH B stalked the pace, chased the leaders on the turn, came four wide into the lane and

Footnotes
WAGON BOSS awaited room behind the pacesetters to the final turn, angled out, rallied into the stretch and edged away. IT'S GAME TIME stalked the
pace outside, rallied to the front at the quarter pole but was outfinished. KOAN far back early, commenced his rally after the half, and offered only a mild bid
late. IN EQUALITY outrun early, saved ground advancing while no threat. EXCHEQUER forced the pace outside to midway on the final turn then faded.
NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ lacked speed and was never a factor. ROYAL COUP saved ground early, moved out on the final turn and faltered. RISQUE REBEL
chased three wide and gave way readily. AHSAD set a pressured pace inside to the far turn and stopped. RELISHMENT trailed early and raced far behind
throughout.
