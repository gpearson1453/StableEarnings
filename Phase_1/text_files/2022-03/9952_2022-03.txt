QUARANTINA trailed along the inside for six furlongs, shifted out to the five path entering the stretch, responded with a burst of speed to make the lead late
and drew off under a hand ride. SWEET BETTY JOYCE away alertly, set the early pace under pressure, shook clear on the far turn then was no match for
the winner. BEACH PEACH offered a mild bid along the inside on the second turn then leveled off. PRINCESS TINE (FR) failed to menace. TALK DIRTY
pressed the pace three wide into the far turn then stopped. LA CAFETERA prompted the pace three wide for a half and also stopped.

Footnotes
LORAN HOLIDAY (ARG) sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, drifted to the five path entering the stretch, bumped the runner up a
furlong out, was bumped repeatedly by that one in deep stretch, dug in gamely and proved best by the narrowest of margins. VELVET SAMI settled inside,
angled out on the far turn, drew to the winners outside a furlong out, was bumped by that one, drifted in bumping the winner through deep stretch and just
missed. ORBITING THE SKY trailed for a little over a half then finished determinedly along the rail. CHECK SIX failed to menace. SARATOGA STYLE
chased the pace two wide into the stretch, drifted to the eight path and faded. MANHATTAN LADY was pinched back at the start, surged along the rail
before a half, matched strides into the far turn then came up empty. WICKED LOVE was through after a half. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY
THEN UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
UNCLE KEVIN stalked the pace into the stretch, rallied three wide in the six path to make the lead past the furlong marker and drew clear under mild urging.
AWESOME OX dueled for the lead along the inside until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. SHARINGTHEJOURNEY battled for the lead two
wide until mid stretch and weakened late. TRACKING GOLD passed tiring rivals. COTTON JIM had speed into the turn, swung out past the middle of the
racetrack and gave way. SILVER DOLLAR CITY failed to menace.
