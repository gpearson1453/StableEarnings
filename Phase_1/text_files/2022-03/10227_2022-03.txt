Footnotes
AMOREENA STAR was angled out in the opening furlong to follow the pace three and four wide, responded into the lane and closed with a late rush to be
up in the final jump. FASHION FACT was on the pace outside LOVESAFLYIN through the turn, briefly got clear through midstretch then was caught in the
closing jump. CHIEFTESS just just off the early leaders three wide and lacked a final closing run. LOVESAFLYIN forced the pace inside FASHION FACT
through the turn then weakened a bit in the lane. RIVER RAIN saved ground and failed to mount a bid. TOURIST LIKE ME was not a factor.

HARDWORKCLEANLIVIN moved up four wide to challenge going up the backstretch, continued outside EL DIABLO GRANDE to duel through the far turn
into the lane and went gamely to narrowly gain the edge on the wire. EL DIABLO GRANDE angled in to make the pace two wide early, was joined by the
winner heading up the backstretch, dueled that one through the far turn and lane in a game run. WRITTEN PERMISSION was angled four wide going to the
far turn, moved up into the lane and just gained the show. OMEN OF CHANGE was along the inside and could not hold the show spot. WINNERS LUCK
moved up four wide while not a threat. R DUB was always back. WEST COAST BROKER tired three wide.

Footnotes
XTREME LYRA was on the pace about the two path while prompted by SNOW MAN, dug in late as that one challenged and narrowly held. SNOW MAN
tracked the winner's pace outside throughout, closed through the lane but could not get by. KING OF ANYTHING moved up inside on the far turn to have
aim into the stretch but could not close on the top pair. FULKERSON stalked the pace in good position four wide but could not close the gap late. GOOSE
saved ground in reach of the early pace and weakened. TACKSON was always back. DRASTIC was not a threat three to four wide.

Footnotes
SENTIMENTAL CROSS was just off the early lead three wide, bid nearing the lane to move clear and held safe under steady handling. RABBIT TWENTY
TWO was in reach of the leader four wide but could not produce the needed late run. DIXIE TRIXIE was along the inside, angled out into the lane but could
not threaten the top pair late. INSPIRATUS angled out through the turn but could not produce the needed late run. LOTS OF GOLD was shuffled back at the
break and failed to threaten while five wide into the lane. HOT HABANERO showed brief speed to gain the two path and weakened. SCARLETT O'HANNA
was not a factor. RINGAROUNDTHEROSIE was outside and always back. SOMERSET PRIDE trailed.
