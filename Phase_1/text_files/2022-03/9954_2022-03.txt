Footnotes
JUMPMASTER prompted the early pace inside of NOBLE COMMANDER, dueled inside of that foe around the turn, took over from near the three
sixteenths, and held under a drive. ANNAMATED MOON tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, began to gain on
them past the quarter, tipped out to the four to five path approaching the eighth pole, rallied with good interest under a drive and just missed. NOBLE
COMMANDER set the pace early while prompted by JUMPMASTER, dueled outside of that foe around the bend, was no match from upper stretch but
chased on best of the rest. YES IT'S ROO broke last, chased near the rear inside of TOP HAT TREASON down the back straight and in the two to three
path on the turn, floated out to the five path in upper stretch, drifted out slightly more and offered no rally in the lane. TOP HAT TREASON settled two wide
in the rear flight, continued outside of YES IT'S ROO in the three to four path on the bend, trailed into the lane in the five path, and mustered no bid.

Footnotes
HONOR COLLECTION broke inward, chased outside of DOMINANT FACTOR toward the rear of a strung-out field, began to take gradually closer order
from near the five eighths, rallied in the four path around the far turn, swung three wide into the stretch, sustained his rally under a drive, battled two wide
down the lane and prevailed. DOMINANT FACTOR was shut off in the opening strides when HONOR COLLECTION broke in, settled toward the rear inside
of that foe, began to gain steam past the five eighths in tandem with HONOR COLLECTION, kicked on in earnest up the inside past the quarter, headed
BERMONDSEY near the three sixteenths, battled inside of HONOR COLLECTION down the lane but was outgamed. ECONOMIC POWER was a bit slow
into stride, settled at the rear of a well strung field, began to rally past the seven sixteenths, improved three wide around the far turn, raced four wide into the
lane, kept on willingly but ultimately did not have enough to reel in the top two. BERMONDSEY soon led, raced well clear through the clubhouse turn and
down the back straight, carried a diminishing lead around the far turn, was headed by DOMINANT FACTOR to his inside near the three sixteenths while
racing between foes and folded. ICHIGO tracked two wide well behind the pacesetter, took closer order on the leader from the half, was in range to the
quarter and emptied out. MIDTOWN tracked the pace inside of ICHIGO until being outpaced from the seven sixteenths.

Footnotes
QUICKER broke sharply, prompted the pace outside of INTERCEPT, engaged him in a duel at the five sixteenths, continued to battle outside him down the
lane, and edged away in the final sixteenth. INTERCEPT was sent for speed inside, set the early pace while prompted by QUICKER, dueled inside that foe
from the five sixteenths, fought to the sixteenth pole but could not hold him at bay late. MEROCKETMAN tracked the leading pair inside of KONKIE early,
chased the leading pair in the three to four path around the bend, proved no match for them in the lane but chased on willingly in the four to five path in the
lane to prove best of the rest. NAUTICAL NATURE was hard to settle early, raced two wide near the rear early, rallied inside of horses in the two to three
path around the turn, leveled off near the three sixteenths, and chased on under a drive in the lane while ultimately no threat for the top three. PEPE TONO
settled at the rear, swung out into the lane, and passed tiring horses in the seven to eight path. KONKIE tracked the leading pair outside of
MEROCKETMAN early, raced in the four path on the turn, and gradually weakened from the three eighths. WARM SUNNY BREEZE chased midfield early,
raced toward the rear in the four path on the turn, and was outpaced from the five sixteenths. STONE SCULPTOR settled near the rear inside early, raced
in the two to three path on the turn, and mustered no rally.

ASK NEAL raced between horses midfield early, settled back to race in second last into the back straight, was pushed along from near the half, responded
with a rally, tipped three wide into the lane, sustained his bid and outgamed BOCK late. BOCK cleared to the lead, was engaged by BIFF near the five
sixteenths, fought inside of that foe to the furlong mark, turned him away, was confronted by ASK NEAL near the sixteenth, tried gamely but was defeated
late. HOLD THE IRISH chased inside early, continued at the inside of the tracking flight down the back straight and into the far turn, tipped out four wide into
the lane, found his best in the final furlong but came on too late. BIFF tracked the pace between horses, engaged outside of BOCK nearing the five
sixteenths, battled outside of that foe from there until the eighth pole, but weakened in the final furlong. YES FOR LESS broke slowly, settled at the rear,
went to a drive near the half mile pole, nonetheless trailed inside around the far turn and was not persisted with late. AFLEET TRAXX tracked the pace three
wide, made a steady retreat from the seven sixteenths and was not persevered with late.

GETOFFMYBACK chased inside early, raced second last around the turn, began to gain inside approaching the quarter pole, swept to the lead under a
drive inside at the head of the stretch, and cleared off in the final furlong. WHERE U B was placed on the lead, set the pace down the back straight and in
the two path on the turn, was urged approaching the quarter, nonetheless was headed by GETOFFMYBACK to his inside near the three sixteenths, and
proved a clear second best from near the furlong pole. TORAZO settled at the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, and improved mildly inside down the
lane to pass tiring horses. KUDURO chased outside of GETOFFMYBACK early, inched forward three wide into the turn, was urged near the three eighths
and made a three wide bid on the leader in earnest, but emptied out four wide into the lane and retreated. SARATOGA WILDCAT tracked the pacesetter
down the back straight, edged closer to the leader near the half, stalked between horses around the turn, loomed in range three wide into the lane, and
emptied out from the three sixteenths.

Footnotes
ANNA ROCKS was sent clear, set an uncontested pace, continued with an advantage in the two to three path around the far turn, was driven into the lane
to turn back KERICS BEAUTY and proved best. KERICS BEAUTY tracked the pace outside of OUR SWEET PEA, was urged near the three eighths and
advanced to loom outside the leader, was no match for ANNA ROCKS into the lane, drifted out through upper stretch and midstretch, and chased on a clear
second best. NORTHERN CROSS raced inside of LAURA'S ANGLE near the rear early, chased behind the tracking flight down the backstretch while still
inside that same foe, was urged into the turn, chased while saving ground on the far turn, swung out and was driven in the four path in upper stretch, proved
no threat to the top pair but chased on best of the rest. OUR SWEET PEA tracked the pace inside of KERICS BEAUTY, was urged inside past the half,
began to flatten out from the seven sixteenths, and proved no further threat when driven in upper stretch. NINJA PRINCESS was slow into stride, settled at
the rear, raced well behind the rest of the field down the back straight and in the four to five path on the far turn, raced into the lane in the five path and
lacked the needed rally. LAURA'S ANGLE settled near the rear outside of NORTHERN CROSS, continued in the chasing pair with that foe down the
backstretch, was urged near the seven sixteenths, and then driven into the lane in the four path, had no response and weakened.

Footnotes
DON GIUSEPPE was sent for speed inside, vied for the early lead, cruised clear under his own power from near the three eighths, opened up further when
hand urged in upper stretch and won ridden out despite drifting out. GANDI was fractious in the gate, was prominent three wide early, tracked the leader two
wide around the turn, was no match from the three eighths, was driven in the four path into the lane, proved no match for DON GIUSEPPE, was passed for
place by CHAIN REACTION in upper stretch, but came back gamely to regain those honors in the final strides. CHAIN REACTION was sent for speed early,
settled back approaching the half to track the pace when it was clear he was outsprinted, tracked in the ________ path on the turn, raced into the lane in the
three path, did not threaten DON GIUSEPPE but did advance to second inside of GANDI in upper stretch, but did not have enough late between horses to
hold the place. KAZTHAROS tracked five wide early, was pushed along to chase in the five path on the turn, angled inward in upper stretch, improved under
a drive inside in the final furlong but could not get up for place in time. BUFF AND SHINE settled at the rear of the main group down the backstretch, raced
in the two path on the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. CARPE SOGNO settled second last early, continued in the rear
pair two wide on the turn, raced two wide into the lane and offered no rally. NEWS ITEM broke inward and was slow into stride, settled at the rear, was
urged inside into the turn, continued in the rear pair around the bend and had no rally in the stretch. FREEAINTFREE raced four wide in the front flight early,
gradually weakened in the three to four path from the seven sixteenths, and had nothing further when urged in upper stretch.

Footnotes
LADDIE LIAM was prominent early, attended the leader between horses around the first turn, stalked off of SOLAR WARMING when that foe cleared into
the back straight, made a two wide bid into the far turn while still moving sweetly, headed that foe approaching the five sixteenths, opened up further when
driven in upper stretch and proved much the best. POCOPSON STATION chased the leading flight inside through the first turn, advanced to join the inside
of the tracking flight approaching the five sixteenths, tracked the pace in the two path on the far turn, proved no match for LADDIE LIAM from the five
sixteenths, was driven into the lane in the three to four path and kept on second best. SOLAR WARMING cleared into the first turn though was shortly
thereafter attended by LADDIE LIAM and DIDNT DO IT from his outside, shook clear again near the three quarters, led inside into the far turn, was headed
by LADDIE LIAM approaching the five sixteenths, proved no match for that foe, and flattened out. CATTLE DRIVE chased three wide around the clubhouse
turn, settled back toward the rear into the back straight, began to improve slightly approaching the half, chased the leading trio on the far turn, was driven in
the five to six path into the lane, and ultimately lacked the needed rally. GEMS MINESHAFT RVF settled at the rear, continued while saving ground on the
far turn, and had no bid under a drive in the lane. DIDNT DO IT attended the early pace three wide, weakened gradually from the five eighths, continued to
lose ground in the three path on the far turn, and was allowed to trail home.
