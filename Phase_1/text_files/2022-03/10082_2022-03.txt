CIELO DIAMANTE pressed the quick pace just off of TROPICANA GIRL through the turn, was roused leaving the turn to confront that foe, took command
into the final furlong and drew clear in the end. TROPICANA GIRL was hustled from the break, set fast fractions while holding the winner at bay through the
turn, was confronted by CIELO DIAMANTE leaving the bend, could not hold that rival off and was outfinished in the stretch, while clear of the rest for
second. LA POPIS stalked the quick pace from a ground saving position and gave way in the drive. HAYDEN'S ANGEL chased the pace from a two wide
path on the turn and did not have a late response. NISHICO chased the pace outside of rivals and faded in the stretch run. SOUND OF THE SURF took up
in the early stages off of heels, chased along the inside on the turn and gave out in the late going.

Footnotes
LASTBESTHOPE contested the fast early pace with MINSKY, edged clear of that rival off of the turn, was confronted again by the runner-up in the final
sixteenth and dug in and held to prevail. MINSKY (IRE) engaged with LASTBESTHOPE soon after the break and dueled on the front end through the turn,
lost ground to that foe in upper stretch, was put to steady urging through the lane, closed on the winner in the final stages and just missed for the win while
well clear of the rest. PHILIPIE FAST chased the early fast pace from the inside and was outkicked in the stretch run. K P SILVER BULLET was off a bit
slowly, chased the fast pace through the turn and made a mild late bid in the drive. DRUMADOON stalked the pace outside of rivals and weakened in the
stretch run. SEVERIN was forwardly placed while three wide through the turn and gave way in the late stages.

Footnotes
DISTORTED QUEEN was away alertly and was hustled to the front to set the fractions, extended the lead leaving the far turn, felt late pressure from RUN
FOR MY HONEY but held safely for the win. RUN FOR MY HONEY attended to the pace, gained ground on DISTORTED QUEEN nearing the
quarter-marker, lost position in upper stretch, closed well in the late stages to put pressure on the winner but could not reel her in and held for second in the
end. BONNIE BRAE was forwardly placed while saving ground throughout, gained ground nearing the quarter-marker but was outfinished in the late stages.
THREE DIMENSIONAL stalked the pace from a three wide path, gained ground in the stretch but was unable to reel in the top trio in the end. GYPSY
STREET was rank and hard to place along the first turn and was five wide leaving the seven-eighths marker, maintained a wide trip into the second turn and
did not mount a late rally. BEIGNET was a bit rank and hard to place along the first turn and floated six wide leaving the seven-eighths marker, tucked in
along the rail into the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
JAN JAN CAN stalked the pace from a three wide path on the turn, was roused leaving the bend, confronted BREAKING THE CODE inside of the final
furlong, battled with that rival through the sixteenth-marker, shook free in the late stages and dug in to hold over the oncoming runner-up. ST. ANNIE'S
INDY chased the pace through the turn, angled out for the drive, closed well in the late stages, could not reel in JAN JAN CAN in the end but was up in time
for the place. BREAKING THE CODE disputed the early pace with PULPIT SINGER, took the lead from that foe nearing the quarter-marker, was confronted
by JAN JAN CAN leaving the furlong grounds, battled back against that rival through the sixteenth-marker, was bested in the late stages and was edged for
second in the end. CLOCHARD STREET chased the early pace, steadied in tight quarters leaving the three furlong marker and dropped back and did not
offer a late bid in the drive. PULPIT SINGER broke alertly and was sent to the front in the early stages, dueled for the early lead with BREAKING THE
CODE, lost the lead along the turn and gave way in the stretch. OYSTER SHOOTER lacked early speed to the turn and did not have a late kick in the
stretch run. BRITE TAN chased the pace four wide on the turn and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
O'NEILL'S LEGACY broke sharply and sped to the front in the early going while opening a clear lead, extended the lead into the lane, was kept to task in the
final stages and pulled away at the end. EMPIRE PASS saved ground while chasing the pace, advanced along the inside nearing the furlong grounds, was
outkicked by the winner in the late stages but kept on to be a clear runner-up. BLUE WILDCAT stalked the pacesetter from a two wide path on the turn,
gave ground to O'NEILL'S LEGACY leaving the bend, gave way in the late going and just held on for third. SKY MAKER saved ground while chasing the
pace, did not have a late kick in the stretch run but just missed for the show. LOUD FUSAICHI stalked the pace to the turn, gained ground three wide
nearing the quarter-marker but weakened in the late stages. BRITTANY BREEZE chased the pace outside of rivals on the turn, lost ground into the stretch
and was not a threat. TEXAS CHARM stumbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, lacked early speed to the turn and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
TROJAN CLUBHOUSE broke alertly and took command of the early pace into the first turn, was well rated through the half-mile marker, shook free of a
prompting rival into the stretch run and kicked clear in the late stages. REV REE settled just off of the early pace while never far back, mounted a four wide
bid nearing the quarter-marker, closed on TROJAN CLUBHOUSE in the final furlong but was outkicked in the end, while holding for the place. GEA stalked
the fractions while saving ground, made a two wide bid into the stretch, was outfinished in the late going but was a clear third. SHERILINDA attended to the
moderate pace through the quarter-marker, was outrun into the stretch drive and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
REBALATION was off a bit slow and settled in the early stages, was steered widest into the stretch run, made a bold late rally in the final sixteenth and was
up in time to tag the runner-up for the win. DOGGY DREAMS pressed the fast fractions through the turn, closed on ATLANTIC STRIKE nearing the furlong
grounds, led while on the left lead in the final sixteenth and was tagged in the final strides by the fast closing winner, while holding for the place. PERFECT
STORIES chased the pace four wide on the turn, advanced in the stretch run, was outkicked in the final sixteenth but held for the show. ATLANTIC STRIKE
broke alertly and was sent in the early stages, set fast fractions through the turn, was confronted nearing the furlong grounds and was outfinished in the late
going. TIGER QUEEN chased the fast pace from a two wide path on the turn and lacked a late kick in the drive. CAROLINA MIA broke in and bothered
PREMIUMONSATURDAY at the start, was forwardly placed along the inside through the turn, gained ground nearing the furlong marker but gave way in the
final stages. PREMIUMONSATURDAY was pinched at the start and off slowly, lacked speed to the turn and was not a factor. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU chased
the fast early pace from the midflight, lost ground into the drive and tired in the late stages. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
START INVOLVING CAROLINA MIA AND PREMIUMONSATURDAY AND RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF
FINISH STEMMING FROM THE INCIDENT.
