two to three wide and finished second best. PARLAY PETE set all the pace and weakened a bit in the final stages. JIMBO'S BIZ was forwardly placed along
the inside, checked near the three eighths pole and kept on while continuing to race from the inside. ROCK CITY ROADHOG raced in tight quarters early,
settled off the pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. BIG HEARTED FACTOR raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no
response. HANSENS MISCHIEF was off slowly, raced along the inside around the far turn and never was a factor. BUBBAS DIXIE was slow early and

OURBESTFRIEND D L showed good early speed to set the early pace and drew away through the stretch run under a mild hand ride. HOLDING FAST was
allowed to settle early, moved up five to six wide through the upper stretch and was no match for the winner. KING DEUCE stalked the pace, saved ground
throughout and was no match for the top pair to race along for third. GUINESSEY dropped back early, raced two to three wide and had no response.
SPEEDY FELLAR broke to the outside, settled off the early pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no response. FAYETTE WARRIOR saved
ground and never threatened. RAY'S ANGEL was hustled along and tired.

PREFERRED PROSPECT vied for the early lead from the inside, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure. PRAIRIE SQUALL vied for the early lead
while racing between horses and finished gamely to the wire. BOBBY BOOTS stalked the pace, raced three to four wide in the lane and finished willingly to
the wire. TAP ATTACK was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide and showed good late interest. LAST CALL LEROY settled off the early pace, raced
near the inside and had no final winning bid. TOMBI raced five wide around the far turn and never was a factor. PACK'N IRON raced two to three wide and
never threatened. NEXTPORTOFCALL was unhurried early, raced six wide to seven wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor. PAPA JOE
failed to respond. DIRTY DEEDS stumbled at the break, rushed to lay up close and tired.
