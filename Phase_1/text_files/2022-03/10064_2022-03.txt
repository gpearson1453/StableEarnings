Footnotes
SISTER SHIRLEY was hustled along from the inside down the backstretch, moved up two wide through the lane and finished well to get up strong pressure.
DIXIE TRIXIE chased the top pair early, moved up three and closed in well late. RAVENS BLING stalked the early going, move up four to five wide into the
upper stretch and made a mile late gain. HOT HABANERO was quick to begin from the outside and was empty late. RINGAROUNDTHEROSIE dropped
back early, raced three deep and had no response. DIAMOND IN THE SUN was injured and had to be vanned off. Internal racing fractions were
unavailable. Photo finish margins were estimated through race replay due to photo finish malfunction.
