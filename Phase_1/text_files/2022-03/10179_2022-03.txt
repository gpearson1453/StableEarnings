Footnotes
BIRTHDAY PARTY settled off of a the pace in the four path, launched a four wide gain approaching the far turn, sustained his charge to bid outside of the
leader while in the three path approaching the five sixteenths pole, led at that marker, drew clear in upper stretch, and held sway from an inner battling foe.
GUN WAR set the pace along the inside, but was headed by an outer bidding rival with a quarter mile to go, then kept on to secure place. JOEBOY stalked
three wide, gained between horses into the far turn along with an outer BIRTHDAY PARTY, but failed to match bidding strides turning for home, chased that
clear foe through the lane from between horses, and prevailed over his outer counterpart for show. F J'S GEM trailed the field in the three path around the
first turn, rallied five wide into the far turn, ranged up four wide turning for home to attempt a bid passing the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace in upper
stretch, flattened out, and got outfinished by an inner foe for show. C F JOHNATHAN stalked two wide while in the three path around the first turn, tucked
down to the two path before getting outmoved by a trio of outer rivals into the far turn, then shifted outside of them in upper stretch, and stayed on late.
VALIANT DEFENDER stalked two wide and between horses into the first turn, cleared an inner rival around that bend, but faded into the far turn.
FIFTYFIVE STRONG tracked inside early on, but failed to sustain position around the first turn, and got outrun thereafter.

BODIE ON POINTE set the pace, met STAR PRADO's bid at the five sixteenths pole, but shook clear of her at the quarter pole, inched away, and held
sway while hanging on her left lead. MIDNIGHT TRIP was bumped and pushed outwardly at the start by an inner foe, raced far back three wide, gained in
the three path into and around the turn to track the leaders entering the lane, then tipped to the four path in midstretch, and stayed on to reach place. STAR
PRADO prompted the pace two wide while a staying a path away from the leader, ranged up to bid at the five sixteenths pole, but was turned away entering
the lane, chased the clear leader through midstretch, but lost place late while tiring. SPECTACULAR IZZY stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a
bid before tiring. SWIMHARD DREAMBIG settled far back two wide, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and stayed on, but failed to threaten. GOLDEN
EXPRESSO leaned outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, trailed the field in the four path around the turn, and was outrun. MISSGREELEY'SSONG
saved ground far back, and never got involved. SOCIAL GALAXY stalked three wide while in the four path, but faded entering the lane, and weakened while
hanging on her left lead.

Footnotes
BRAVE NUGGET stalked the top pair from the four path around the turn, bid while well in hand in the five path entering the lane, took charge in upper
stretch, and was going away while ridden out. CHEYANN GLITTERS bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace three wide, cut the corner
entering the lane, rallied along the rail to gain place at the furlong grounds, and was second best. JOEY'S SASSY SHANA was last away while breaking a
step slowly, raced far back into the turn, gained in the four path around the bend, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes to
gain show entering the final sixteenth. ST MARIA laid off of the pace along the inside, but steadied in tight quarters into the turn, took the bend in the three
path, swung to the seven path entering the lane, then moved up in the eight path late. STRONG CHICK broke outwardly, tracked in midpack three wide,
came under a drive turning for home, came into the lane in the five path, and finished by evenly after being brushed by an inner foe entering the final
sixteenth. SONG OF PARADISE chased along the inside from midpack, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, hung on his left lead while tipping in at the
furlong grounds, and improved along the rail. BLUE RIDGE ROMANCE set the pace inside of a rival while a path off of the rail, proved no match for an outer
bidder in upper stretch, lost place to an inner foe at the furlong grounds, and weakened while bumping and pushing his outer early-pace counterpart
outwardly entering the final sixteenth. MRS. DELLA was briefly fractious awaiting the start, vied for the lead two wide from the three path, but offered little
resistance to an outer foe in upper stretch, yielded before being bumped and pushed by an inner rival and caused to brush an outer foe entering the final

Footnotes
WORLD WAR maintained a loose advantage in the three path around both turns, shifted to the six path entering the lane for better footing, then drifted
further out in midstretch while holding sway, and inched further away late. MONEY WELL SPENT tracked in midpack in the two path, rallied in that lane
through upper stretch to gain place from outer rivals at the furlong grounds, and was second best. EXPLOSIVELY HOT tracked along the inside, gained
place from an outer foe into the far turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, then lost place at the furlong grounds to an inner foe while chasing the
leader, and held show. ALLIACEOUS brushed an inner foe at the start, raced far back two wide, floated wider entering the lane along with rivals, but dove to
the rail at the quarter pole, improved in upper stretch, but lacked the needed kick to sustain a bid. AIR GUITAR STAR bumped with rivals on either side
while being put to tight quarters at the start, laid off of the pace in the four to three path, then stayed on mildly between horses through the final furlong. MY
LITTLE JEN received a bump to her hind quarters at the start, tracked three wide, then in the four path around the far turn, shifted to the seven path entering
the lane, drifted further out in midstretch, and faded. BELLAMY CAY raced far back along the inside, trailed around the far turn, shifted to the five path in
upper stretch, and passed tired rivals. GATOR PROUD trailed in the three path earl on, moved out of last into the far turn, swung to the seven path entering
the lane, and made little impact. VISIONOFWILDTIMES stalked in the two path, then in the three path and from between horses around the far turn, floated
to the six path entering the lane, and weakened approaching midstretch. STEPH'SFULLASUGAR saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.

Footnotes
MAYAPRETTY vied for the lead two wide from the three path, led passing the three furlong pole, dug in while resisting SMART PEGASUS's bid in upper
stretch, dueled after getting headed approaching midstretch, but fought on gamely, and prevailed. SMART PEGASUS stalked two wide, got outmoved by an
outer foe at outer foe around the far turn, shifted out and split rivals in the four path passing the quarter pole, bid outside of MAYAPRETTY in upper stretch,
wrestled a narrow advantage approaching the furlong grounds, but was outdueled by her inner counterpart. J Z'S FIRST stalked along the inside awaited
racing room while getting outmoved by outer foes around the far turn, trailed approaching the five sixteenths pole, shifted two wide in upper stretch,
improved between horses to gain show leaving the furlong grounds, and held that position. BOBBIES REASON bumped the gate at the start while breaking
multiple lengths slowly, trailed the field early on, moved to a tracking position in the four path down the backstretch, gained into the far turn to loom a danger
outside of the leading pair around that bend, but was outkicked while getting floated to the five path entering the lane, then kept on in the final furlong, but
missed reclaiming show. VEILAZIG broke inwardly, vied inside of the eventual winner while in the two path, got headed by that foe passing the three furlong
pole, sustained a chase through midstretch, but weakened in the final sixteenth. NOFANSINTHESTANDS hopped slightly while breaking a step slowly, laid
off of the pace before trailing down the backstretch, attempted a circling rally in the five path around the far turn, but flattened out entering the lane without
reaching contention.

Footnotes
CHIMNEY ROCK bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed along the inside, then produced a steady rail rally through the lane to gain an advantage
approaching the wire. MR. FOUR SEVENS stalked along the inside, bid inside of the leader in upper stretch, led at the furlong grounds, but drifted out
slightly shortly after, got surpassed by an inner foe in the very late stages, and saved place. HOORAY AUSTIN settled off of the pace along the inside,
swung to the seven path in upper stretch, rallied with a good kick in the final furlong, but was too late, and missed reaching place. APACHE TEARS tracked
four wide, then three wide while in the four path around the turn, got floated to the six path entering the lane, chased the inner bidding leaders thereafter,
then got outkicked by an outer rival for show in the final sixteenth. QUEST FOR AVETTE bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace along the inside
while a path off of the rail, was guided to the five path passing the quarter pole, but allowed an inner foe to bid by doing so, got headed approaching the
furlong grounds, and weakened between horses soon after. DRAKKAR tracked in midpack two wide, chased in the four path in upper stretch, but offered no
rally. MIDNIGHT BAYOU took the turn in the four to five path while far back, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and failed to factor. CAJUN BERTI
pressed the pace two wide from the three path, but failed to keep pace with rivals on either side entering the lane, and tired. PILLAGE DA VILLAGE stalked
three wide early on, but faded into the turn.

Footnotes
CAVE CREEK tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, decided to not split the leaders in the three path in upper stretch, instead bumped an
outer foe while tipping four wide and to the five path at the furlong grounds, then rallied between horses late to gain an advantage at the wire. KICK N KISS
tracked four wide, ranged up turning for home, but came into the lane in the seven path, chased inner rivals through midstretch, inched closer and vied in
the final sixteenth, but drifted outwardly approaching the wire, and got outfinished by an inner foe. BELMAR BEAUTY prompted the pace two wide, bid for
the lead along with outer rivals at the five sixteenths pole, led in the four path in upper stretch, clung to an advantage into the final furlong, but was
outfinished by outer foes. FASHION MOON lost her rear footing at the start and trailed early on, took the turn in the four path far back, swung to the nine
path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. TOTAL MALICE stalked along the inside while a bit keen behind the leaders approaching the turn, saved
ground, then chased along the rail through the lane, inched closer approaching the final sixteenth in hopes of bidding, but flattened out late. GREEN
MONSTER set the pace along the inside, met a trio of bids at the five sixteenths pole, shifted to the two path entering the lane while still vying, but yielded
between foes late. WINNING QUALITY stalked three wide, bid for the lead between horses at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace in the five
path in upper stretch, then took a bump from an inner foe at the furlong grounds, and faded. BLONDIE LOX BABE laid off of the pace five wide while under
steady urging, inched closer at the five sixteenths pole, but faded entering the lane. CRY LIKE A BABY failed to factor, then was eased through the late
stages, then walked across the wire.

Footnotes
REIGNING SPIRIT sat reserved along the inside, shifted six wide entering the lane, rallied outside of ARABIAN PRINCE, got herded outwardly by that foe in
the final furlong, sustained a bid passing the sixteenth pole while hanging on his left lead, and prevailed. ARABIAN PRINCE tracked two to three wide, came
into the lane four wide, rallied while shifting outside of the clear leader in the final furlong, bid entering the final sixteenth along with an outer rival, and got
outkicked. COURAGEOUSLY laid off of the pace along the inside, then in the three path around the far turn, split foes in upper stretch, stayed on, but failed
to match rallying strides with a pair of outer rivals in the final furlong. MR. UNIVERSE trailed early on, took the far turn in the three path far back, swung
seven wide entering the lane, then shifted in while staying on, and reached a minor share late. HOLY EMPEROR settled far back in the three path, then four
wide around the far turn while improving, stayed on five wide in upper stretch, but was outkicked at the furlong grounds. SHIPPINGPORT opened up a very
large lead down the backstretch, but tired entering the lane, drifted out while running on fumes leaving the furlong grounds, and was overhauled passing the
sixteenth pole. FED MONEY failed to factor. CALIFORNIA HOLIDAY tracked in the two path, and tired. CARTIER CAT saved ground in midpack, but
weakened in upper stretch. GIMME SOME MO stalked the run-away leader from the two path, remained that foe's closest pursuer turning for home, but
weakened at the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
DRAFT CHOICE laid off of the pace in the two path, moved forward to take aim on the clear leader into the far turn, bid in midstretch, drifted outwardly
through the final furlong, and prevailed late. ALL MIKE NO MAE opened up, met DRAFT CHOICE's bid in midstretch, and was worn down late. MORE
HARDER settled far back along the inside, then rallied between horses in upper stretch. STONE ALLIANCE raced far back two wide, then in the three to
seven path around the far turn, and stayed on. VERO CAMPIONE raced far back in the four path, moved up into the far turn, and failed to menace.
ANYOTHERQUESTIONS tracked from midpack along the inside, and failed to factor. RUNWILDWITHDREAMS laid off of the pace in the four path, took the
far turn in the four to eight path, and made little impact. R T'S D'ORO tracked in midpack in the three to five path, and failed to threaten. CLASSIC'S
OMEGA took back between horses and the start and never got involved. HARD KINGS raced forwardly placed in the two path, then weakened in upper
stretch. MAGNOLIA RIDGE stalked in the three path, then weakened along the inside through the far turn. THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION WAS HAND
TIMED.
