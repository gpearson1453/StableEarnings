Footnotes
LABAN M MO was beaten for early speed, angled to the outside with six furlongs to run, advanced on the outside under urging, made an early move to
make a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the four path on the turn, led past the five-sixteenths, shook clear in the three path into the stretch, lost the lead to
the runner-up while moving closer to the rail inside the three-sixteenths, fought back on the inside of that foe, battled gamely while snug against the fence in
the final sixteenth and determinedly prevailed while jostling at the wire. FORESTWOOD LANE was hustled from the start, settled under some urging, moved
closer before the half-mile pole, chased two then three wide on the turn, gained four wide into the stretch under a drive, took the lead inside the
three-sixteenths then dropped in closer to the winner, battled outside of that foe into the final sixteenth, made it tighter on that opponent under vigorous
urging at that juncture and was denied while jostling at the wire but was well clear for the place. MY INSPIRATION tracked then chased the leader on the
outside, made a bid outside the half-mile pole then took a narrow advantage, vied in the two path under urging on the turn, dropped to the rail under
pressure near the quarter-pole and weakened then brushed with MIGHTY MEISTER approaching the wire but narrowly earned the show. MIGHTY
MEISTER was taken under a strong hold leaving the chute then rated off the pace, brushed with an opponent inside the five-eighths, moved up to make a
bid near the half-mile pole, vied in the three path under urging on the turn, dropped to the two path approaching the quarter-pole and tired then missed the
show after brushing with MY INSPIRATION nearing the wire. BELL BOY settled on the outside, brushed with a foe inside the five-eighths, dropped back
leaving the backstretch, went three wide under urging on the turn and failed to respond. LOOKING TO HEAVEN broke out at the start but came out on even
terms with the rest of the field, angled in while going to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, lost the lead with a half-mile to run, was urged
along against the rail on the turn, dropped back coming to the five-sixteenths and faded. DUE TO A WINTER SAFETY INITIATIVE, ALL RIDERS CARRIED
AN ADDITIONAL TWO POUNDS

Footnotes
COVER PHOTO chased four then five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch seizing command straightened away
and drew clear under a drive kept to task. ADDILYN chased two then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
offered up a bid a furlong out, proved no match for the top one late while along clear of the rest and second best. MEBS WEB chased three then four wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, bid three wide into upper stretch, couldn't sustain the move and weakened in the final furlong while along for the
show honors. INVESTMENT GRADE hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from UP SEVENTYFOUR to the
outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths under challenge from a trio stacked across the track, took the inside route into upper stretch and yielded
the front straightened away, then weakened to the finish. MY GIRL ANNIE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside
route into upper stretch and tired. UP SEVENTYFOUR prompted the leader from the outside two then three wide loosely between foes from the midway
point on the turn, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, faded spinning just off the inside for home and folded in the stretch. Please note due to a winter
safety initiative all riders carried an additional two pounds.

Footnotes
TAMBURRO'S SOX prompted the pace from the outside six paths off the inside early on before tucking three wide with nine-sixteenths to go, made his way
to the two path through the turn increasing the pressure in the leader and coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole taking command at that juncture,
swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under lone threat before edging away to the finish kept to task. STREET CULTURE bumped at the start by
BOSSHIP, who broke out a step, raced forwardly placed three wide down the backstretch until tucked inside with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths and began to tip out swinging five to six wide at the head of the stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge on his wrong lead a
furlong from home, couldn't match the top one late while along well clear of the rest and second best. BOSSHIP broke out a step at the start bumping the
aforementioned foe, chased just off the inside until tucked briefly inside with nine-sixteenths remaining, came under coaxing once more in the two path three
furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and improved position to safely secure the show honors. THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK broke in at the
start striking the near side stall and brushing MOONS THE LIMIT, getting away near the rear of the field, chased four then three paths off the inside down
the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and showed late
interest down a long the rail kicking on belatedly to the finish. MOONS THE LIMIT brushed at the start by THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK, chased five paths off
the inside down the backstretch until tucked three wide with nine-sixteenths to go, went four wide through the turn coaxed along from midway, angled six
wide offering a bid into upper stretch, couldn't sustain the move flattening on to the finish. HARDLY WORKING hustled from the gate, chased three to four
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered no response. DATA DEAL hustled from the start, established the front and
showed the way lightly coaxed in the five path under some pressure from TAMBURRO'S SOX to the outside, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths
and then to the inside half a mile from home coming under increasing pressure from his main pace rival, got placed to coaxing three furlongs out,
succumbed to the pressure just outside the quarter pole and went three then two wide straightened away into upper stretch before backing away to the
finish. HOW YOU FEELING seven paths off the inside down the backstretch early on, tucked four then three wide into the turn, came under urging at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. JUMP STARTER strode greenly six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch before
tucking four then three wide through the turn, went four wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout. Please note due to a winter safety initiative all riders
carried an additional two pounds.

FUNNY JOKE bumped hard with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, chased four wide on the turn,
gained under a strong drive to make a bid into upper stretch, battled with the runner-up in the final furlong, drifted out some nearing the sixteenth-pole and
prevailed under strong urging. INSPIRATION POINT bumped hard with a foe at the start then was taken up, raced at the rear under urging, moved closer
while four then five around the turn, gained under a strong drive to make a bid into upper stretch, battled outside of the winner in the final furlong, drifted out
some approaching the sixteenth-pole and missed but was clear for the place. BALTASAR showed speed on the inside of two foes, was taken up and
dropped off the pace with five furlongs to run, became rank behind foes then steadied a few times before the half-mile pole, checked behind horses while
still rank nearing the three-eighths, shifted three then four wide late on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch, reached a reasonable striking range on
the outside but lacked the needed kick and settled for the show. LORD LICORICE was coaxed along off the pace, came under stronger encouragement
while three then two wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response then missed the show. MOTION TO STRIKE
went to the front, set the pace under pressure from both sides, vied in the two path turn, lost the advantage under urging into upper stretch and gave way.
SMART STORM broke in then brushed with a foe, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn and tired. NATURE BOY was hustled
from the gate, pressed the pace on the inside of the leader, dropped back passing the half-mile pole, came up empty on the turn and retreated. DUE TO A
WINTER SAFETY INITIATIVE, ALL RIDERS CARRIED AN ADDITIONAL TWO POUNDS

Footnotes
ROTKNEE established the front and showed the way in hand from the two path, took closer order to the rail with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing
taking the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive kept to task. AGILITY three then two wide in closest pursuit of the leader, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. G MUNNING chased just off the inside under coaxing
from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily closing through the final furlong in stark contrast to BEST IDEA
being taken in hand and shown the crop to the off side and was rewarded just getting up for the show honors on the wire. BEST IDEA hustled from the gate,
bumped MISTER LARRY with six and a half furlongs to go when leaning briefly outwards, chased along the inside from near the rear, came under a
prolonged drive with half a mile to go riding the rail through the turn until tipped out to swing four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top pair
and was taken back in hand through the final furlong being flashed the crop to the offside and given a sole swat a sixteenth out, attempted to be re-roused
in the final strides when sensing danger to his inside and was nailed on the line for the show honors. MISTER LARRY got bumped with six and a half
furlongs remaining when BEST IDEA briefly leaned out near that station, chased two then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled four to
five wide into upper stretch and faltered. Please note that due to a winter safety initiative all riders carried an additional two pounds.

Footnotes
WASP was taken in hand early then guided to the outside, settled on the outside then moved up to track the pace, engaged the leaders in the four path on
the turn, took the lead just inside the five-sixteenths, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch, fought outside of the runner-up into the final
sixteenth then moved clear under strong handling. KHALI MAGIC broke out at the start, moved up to press the pace on the outside, took the lead in the
three path early on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner under urging inside the five-sixteenths, fought on well inside that foe to the sixteenth-pole but
was outfinished while clear for the place. IFIHADACHANCE broke out at the start, moved out while settling off the pace, was taken in hand before the
five-eighths then reserved, moved from three to five wide on the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and
lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. CHOOSE HAPPINESS bumped with a rival at the start, settled at the rear, went mostly four wide on the
turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SHADOLAMO showed speed on the inside of a foe, brushed with that rival entering the
main-track, paused while close to heels inside the three-quarter pole then dropped in while falling a bit further off the pace, was asked to move up inside the
leader at the nine-sixteenths, steadied briefly while in tight around the half-mile pole, chased while moving from the inside to the two path on the turn and
came up empty. EPONA'S DREAM bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along towards the rear, went two to three wide on the turn, came four wide
into the stretch and lacked the needed response. QUALITY STONES went to the front, set the pace under pressure, dropped to the rail very early on the
turn then lost the advantage before the three-eighths and faded. DUE TO A WINTER SAFETY INITIATIVE, ALL RIDERS CARRIED AN ADDITIONAL TWO
POUNDS

Footnotes
SAINT SELBY established the front after a brief tussle and showed the way in hand four then three wide under pressure from the outside, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and held safe to prevail. LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE five paths off
the inside in aim of the leader, advanced four wide through the turn applying pressure midway, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide
into upper stretch, ran on chasing the winner home but was ultimately staved off to the finish. TACO BEAN three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. BIG BROWN SHOES tussled briefly for the front
before settling just off the inside in aim of the leader applying some pressure, tucked inside with nine-sixteenths to go before tipping out to the two path
midway on the turn as HONOR AMONG MEN took to the rail in front, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home and made no
late headway. STORM SHOOTER chased four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, offered up a mild bid continuing four wide into upper
stretch, couldn't sustain the move and weakened in the late stages. BUREAUCRAT chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two to three
wide through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cornered three wide at the top of the stretch and weakened. HONOR AMONG MEN hustled
from the gate, vied three wide briefly before prompting just off the inside into the turn, tucked to the rail near the three-eighths, got set down spinning just off
the inside into upper stretch and tired. Please note due to a winter safety initiative all riders carried an additional two pounds.

Footnotes
OUT OF THE BREECH broke a bit slow then was taken up, spotted the front several lengths, was urged along on the outside, moved closer with a half-mile
to run, went five wide on the turn, pursued the leading duo in the stretch, gained into the final sixteenth and got up under strong urging.
HE'SGOTTASHORTFUSE bumped with a rival while off a step slow, recovered to chase the pace, went four wide on the turn, gained to make an outside
bid in upper stretch then took a slim advantage, battled outside of BOOM BOOM KABOOM while still on his inside lead into the final sixteenth and bested
that rival for the place but was denied by the winner. BOOM BOOM KABOOM pressed the pace down the backstretch, vied inside while taking a short lead
around the turn, inched away into the lane, lost the advantage to the winner near the furlong marker, fought on well with that foe to the wire but missed while
well clear for the show. CROCK OF GOLD was ridden along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, remained on his
inside lead to outside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and lacked the needed response. CROSTATA B C was reluctant to load, came
away well while hustled, set the pace under pressure to his inside, lost the lead in the three path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired.
PLATINUM ROAD was hustled from the start, dropped back while showing no speed, rounded the turn in the two path and failed to impact. UNLIKELY
bumped with an opponent at the start while off a bit slow, was urged along towards the rear, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, bumped
with a foe in upper stretch and failed to threaten. APPALACHIAN LEGEND settled off the early pace then came under urging, dropped back leaving the
backstretch, saved ground on the turn, bumped with a foe in upper stretch and was no factor. VINCENT was fractious on the pathway from the paddock and
unseated the rider, broke through the front of the gate while waiting for a reluctant rival to load, was brought back around and reloaded, hit the outside of the
gate at the break, pressed the pace on the inside of the leader, vied between foes in the two path on the turn and capitulated. DUE TO A WINTER SAFETY
INITIATIVE, ALL RIDERS CARRIED AN ADDITIONAL TWO POUNDS
