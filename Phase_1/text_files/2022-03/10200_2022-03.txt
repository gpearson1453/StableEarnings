Footnotes
BRINDISI raced in closest pursuit of the loose pacesetter, took over into the stretch and quickly pulled away while geared down late.
TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT settled off the pace inside, angled out in the stretch and proved easily second best. ICE BAR lagged far behind, moved very wide
on the final turn and passed rivals without menacing. SHOWING OFF saved ground within range, ducked out near the quarter pole tiring.
OUTWORKNFORAKISS urged to a clear advantage, was collared nearing the stretch and gave way. SEBARAY broke sluggishly, chased wide and was
finished after half a mile.

DRENA'S BULLET raced off the pace inside, moved up on the turn, bid four wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside rivals in upper stretch, took over and
drew clear under urging. LUCKY HERO chased close up three wide, bid three wide on the turn, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely in the drive and came
up second best. KOWBOY KARMA was outrun early, came three wide into the lane, rallied late outside and got up for third. THOMAS KNIGHT raced off the
early pace, then stalked, tracked between rivals on the turn, closed mildly and was outkicked. CHAMPERS chased close up between rivals, bid between
horses on the turn, dueled into the stretch and weakened in the lane. SIX CIDER chased on the inside, was steadied and shuffled back when lacking room
at the quarter pole, then had no rally in the lane. OFF DUTY set the pace, dueled inside on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN CHAZZ showed good early speed to set the pace, responded when roused turning for home, dug in gamely in the stretch run, drifted out a bit in
front of SCOTCH ROCK'S in deep stretch and held on determinedly. FEARLESS FLY raced three or four wide off the pace, bid four wide at the quarter
pole, rallied outside in the stretch, dug in gamely in the final furlong and earned the place spot. SCOTCH ROCK'S raced three wide off the pace, bid three
wide at the quarter pole, dueled between rivals through the lane and steadied behind the winner in deep stretch. FULL SEND was off slowly, raced off the
pace, came three wide into the lane and gained mildly to best the others. TEQUILA JR raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane and failed to
threaten. NAVY PIER raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the turn and had no rally. FIFTY CENTS raced two wide off the pace, then chased two
wide and tired. PETER G. FOX was outrun. SIT DOWN GRANDPA bobbled at the break, tracked on the inside, chased and gave way. A Jockey's Objection
by the rider of SCOTCH ROCK'S against the top two finishers was dismissed.

Footnotes
JW'S THIRD MISCHIE held a narrow lead in the two path then edged away through the stretch under strong handling. THEY SHOT SONNY saved ground
to the stretch, angled out rallying and was up for the place. FROSTED INDIAN dueled along the rail and continued willingly to the finish while weakening
slightly. MACH TRIAL lacked speed, moved very wide on the turn and into the stretch. R GOODTIME CHARLIE broke slowest, rushed to contention
between rivals and tired. ARRECIFE dropped far behind then moved extremely wide on the turn and into stretch. TIO WIL chased three wide down the
backstretch and lacked a rally. LITTLE HARBOUR hustled close up between rivals to the turn and weakened. WHAT'S TO BLAME trailed early inside and
was always outrun. MR. ROUNDTREE raced outside within range briefly then gave way readily.

lead near the sixteenth pole, then dug in gamely and determinedly held off the runner up. SILVER EDGE raced three wide early, settled off the pace, moved
up four wide on the far turn, went five wide at the quarter pole, rallied in the final furlong, surged outside of EXIT RIGHT in deep stretch and just missed.

stretch. KADENS COURAGE pulled and was steadied on the first turn, tracked on the inside, then chased and tired. KINGSVILLE raced four wide early,

Footnotes
AMERICAN QUALITY vied wide down the backstretch, took over midway on the turn and drew away while kept to his task. INDIRECTLY saved ground,
weaved through traffic on the turn and closed well late. SPECTACULAR KID advanced very wide on the turn and into the stretch rallying. KIKKERLAND
was urged close up between rivals to the stretch and flattened out. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN) lacked speed racing wide and was no factor. PRIVATE
NETWORK dropped back at the start, was in tight at the top of the stretch. EXPENSIVE saved ground well behind then passed fading rivals. ELITE
MISSION hustled close up inside then began fading on the turn. LAZARETTO led narrowly outside down the backstretch and proved empty in the final
furlong. DOUGIE trailed early and was always far behind. RHOMBUS saved ground off the pace and gave way readily.
