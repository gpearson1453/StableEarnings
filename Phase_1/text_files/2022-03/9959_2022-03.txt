Footnotes
BE NAUGHTY WITH ME was off a step slow at the start, tracked up close along the rail in early stages, launched an inside bid and took over the lead in the
upper stretch, came under attack from DREAMING OF AUBREY in the final furlong, stayed on gamely and held firm. DREAMING OF AUDREY raced in the
back although never far from the frontend, launched a five wide bid into the upper stretch, roused forward to challenge BE NAUGHTY WITH ME for the lead
in the final furlong, stayed solid in response but could not get by the game winner. MAMA LONGLEGS sped to the lead at the start, vied inside rivals around
the turn, got collared at the head of the lane and stayed on for a share. G T'S BLUE SQUALL was forwardly placed in opening stages, vied outside of rivals
around the turn then gave way in the lane. LATTE LOVER got shuffled a bit at the start, chased up close in early stages, vied for the lead around the turn
then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
FREEDOM MATTERS stalked the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn, reeled in the pacesetter near the sixteenth pole
and held safe while drifting out a bit late. STIRLING DRIVE raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied outside. MAX K. O. threw his head at the start,
saved ground off the pace early, went three wide around the far turn and rallied between foes in the lane. GRACEFUL KITTEN set the pace two wide
around the first turn, angled in entering the far turn, drew clear around that bend, held clear past the eighth pole, was collared near the sixteenth pole and
weakened. LANDBISCUIT saved ground in range, went two wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. REGAL SPEAKER chased the pace two
and three wide and was one-paced through the lane. MANDATE failed to menace while racing two wide. GREY STREAK had early speed inside and faded
after a half. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
SOSOSUBTLE broke inward and awkwardly, got taken off the rail early and inched up to contention, bid outside CONVERTER after six furlongs, took over
into the stretch and shifted to the rail, and widened under a mild drive. PROSPECT PROJECT prompted the pace two to three wide, could not go with the
top one into the lane, and ran on clearly second best. KING CAIRO had a ground-saving trip, and lacked the needed closing bid. NAVAJO CREED moved
to the rail trailing midway up the backstretch, stayed on the fence to midstretch before moving out, and was along for a share. CONVERTER set the pace in
the two-path for six furlongs, and gave way after being displaced for command. CHURCHILLS VICTORY dropped far back three wide after six furlongs, and
jogged in.

SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING saved ground around the first turn and settled two wide off the early pace, came under a ride with three furlongs left to run,
moved up into striking distance late on the far turn, cleared on top approaching the upper stretch, angled inside, widened to a commanding and wrapped up
in the end. STEAL SUNSHINE was unhurried and saved ground up the backstretch, picked up the pace and moved into contention nearing the quarter pole,
sustained a two wide bid for SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING through the lane and finished clearly second best. SWING SHIFT tracked the clear pacesetter
through early stages, came under a ride entering the final turn, chased three to four wide then came out wider for the drive and churned on for a share.
LITTLE VIC pulled while trying to rate under a snug hold entering the first turn, continued headstrong into the early backstretch then settled into tracking
position, launched a bid for the leader entering the far turn, came three wide into the upper stretch and steadily faded. IN THE UNION was briefly edgy in
the gate, raced three to four wide in the last flight, failed to progress under pressure around the far turn and retreated through the lane. KING CAB opened
up to a clear lead around the first turn, continued to show the way by a commanding margin up the backstretch, began to tire past the quarter pole and
dropped far back.

PAINTBRUSH settled off the pace while racing three wide around the first turn, angled in on the backstretch, saved ground while trailing around most of the
far turn, swung five wide near the quarter pole, kicked in while still in hand, continued on the left lead in the lane and drew off under minimal encouragement.
RUNAWAY BREEZE settled off the early pace while racing three wide, bid four deep to take the lead nearing the lane, led past the eighth pole but was no
match for the winner. SUSANS NOVELA tracked the pace two wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch and was up for the show. BABYITSGOLDOUTSIDE
pressed the pace two wide, had a brief lead around the far turn and weakened in the lane. ROSY APPLE stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in
the lane. UKIYO set the pace along the rail and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
NATURAL POWER (IRE) was off slowest and outrun through the opening three furlongs, tipped to the far outside into the stretch, and finished with a
flourish to overtake the leaders in the closing strides. SHEKKY SHEBAZ sat behind the battling pacesetters on the turn, bid outside through the furlong
grounds, finished gamely but was outkicked. THE VIRGINIAN vied outside GRETZKY THE GREAT heading into the turn, got the best of that dispute after a
half-mile, then was overhauled from outside by the top two. GRETZKY THE GREAT dueled inside THE VIRGINIAN to midstretch, and yielded. CUCINA
made no impact three wide. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) saved ground outrun to the stretch, and made no headway. DALTON moved inside around the turn, and
lacked the needed response. INTO THE SUNRISE faded approaching the stretch two wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED, HALF-MILE FRACTION
UNAVAILABLE. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

STORMY PATTERN rated near midpack up the backstretch, came under a ride three wide near the quarter pole, roused forward to challenge IM A BEAST
in the upper stretch, dueled into late stage then shook free to a slim lead and just lasted under a driving finish. CLAPTON was rated off the early pace, was
ridden along three to four wide around the turn, gathered momentum under a ;left-handed drive, quickly gathered ground in closing stages and narrowly
missed. YES I'M A BEAST sped to the lead soon after the start, showed the way up the backstretch and held firm around the turn, fought back when
challenged by the winner in the upper stretch, dueled from the inside and yielded late. HOORAYHOORAYHOORAY settled and saved ground while rated
off the early pace, was ridden along the rail around the turn, shifted out wider near mid-stretch then finished evenly. HOPE IN HIM stalked the leader along
the rail through early stages, hustled along two wide in contention around the turn, sustained bid into the upper stretch then gave way. ONE MORE SCORE
raced five wide in the back, came out wider into the upper stretch and never threatened. KLUGMAN tracked the early pacesetter, launched a three wide bid
around the turn then faded at the head of the lane.

Footnotes
ENTWINE (IRE) settled off the early pace while racing two wide, edged closer four wide around the far turn, rallied outside, took the lead leaving the
sixteenth pole and dug in to repel RUNAWAY ROCKETTE'S late bid. RUNAWAY ROCKETTE saved ground well off the pace, swung five wide in upper
stretch, closed widest but could not get past the winner. MIA AT MIDNIGHT settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled out nearing the eighth pole
and rallied between foes to gain the show late. CENTSATIONAL set the pace along the rail, led past the sixteenth pole and weakened. SHEA ON A
MISSION stalked the pace inside and was one-paced through the lane. MEET THE BEAUTY tracked the pace four wide around the first turn, edged closer
three deep around the far turn, remained in contention to midstretch then faded. THELASTBULLETSMINE prompted the pace two wide and weakened in
the drive. CULTURED raced off the pace three wide, checked nearing the eighth pole and had no further bids. BASILIA saved ground off the pace, lacked a
clear path in the stretch and was not urged in the late stages. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF CULTURED AGAINST THE WINNER FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
