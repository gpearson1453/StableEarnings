Footnotes
POSTINO'S STORY took over from the start and rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, kept the edge at the rail
on the far turn, drifted into the stretch but dug in under steady encouragement to hold on well. ROOF TOP BAR saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn, was carried outward leaving the turn and steadied off the inside girth of HANDS DOWN while
at the heels of Postino's Story, then dug in to duel for second. The latter settled off the earlier pace in the three and four paths, bid nearing the three eighths
pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. HACKER MAN settled off the pace about the three path, closed
to even terms approaching the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back toward the five sixteenths and flattened off the rail
on the far turn. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE raced well back toward the inside early on, eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole then
flattened in the six path of the far turn. LUFTY'S KISSES raced with the early pace the opening half mile, stalked into the second turn then gave way leaving
the seven sixteenths pole. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Postino's Story, lodged by the rider of Roof Top Bar, but took no
action. In addition, this race was hand timed.

I AM THAT I AM broke outward then settled close to the early pace in the three and four paths, took a short lead at the three quarter pole and was rated
from that point, came under pressure toward the three eighths, contested even terms at the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to hold off the game
challenge of MEDICINE TAIL, who had the early lead and moved to the inside to set the pace, was met at the three quarter pole and stalked, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, contested even terms two deep on the far turn, though, was outfinished in a game stretch try. NARMER was pinched back at
the start and settled off the pace about the four path, bid nearing the three eighths pole but flattened off the rail on the far turn. INDIANA RED mostly saved

SO RED THE ROSE tapered in and stalked off the rail, challenged at the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep at the quarter, drew clear midway
on the turn and was steadily handled through the stretch. COURAGEOUS GRACE raced off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths
pole and rounded the far turn just off the rail, but had to settle for second best. EARNED THE SHOT saved ground off the pace on the first turn, bid nearing
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and came along for third past the eighth pole. ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY drew clear and
angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail at the quarter then faded through the
turn. GALLINELLA settled off the rail and showed little response through the backstretch.
