Footnotes
PISTOL P came away in front and rated a slim lead inside, was pressured leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn,
drew clear of Aaron's Tap into the stretch and held well under steady encouragement. OUT OF CENTS rounded the first turn about the three path, picked
up the chase from the three eighths pole, remained in the three path of the far turn and dueled to take second mid-stretch. FIZBO settled off the pace toward
the inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane to take third but was outfinished for
second. AARON'S TAP stalked the winner two deep then challenged leaving the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage through the far turn,
dropped back into the stretch then gave up the nod in the stretch duel for third. CAYENNE CREEK rounded the first turn about the four path, bid into the
backstretch and rounded the far turn off the rail, though, showed little more. AWSOME FAITH saved ground and showed little response through the

Footnotes
CORRELATE stalked two deep then took the lead toward the seven sixteenths pole, drew clear approaching the quarter pole, rounded the turn near the rail
then kept alert with a hand ride through the stretch. Racing without front shoes, MADE TO BE LUCKY rated a slim early lead inside, was met nearing the
seven sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point then dueled through the upper stretch to take second a sixteenth away. MORE PLEASE was carried to
the five path into the first turn and settled off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then
relented second mid-stretch. SECRET SOULMATE bobbled at the starte then rated close to the early pace in the three and four paths, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then outfinished for third. COOKIE DUNK DUNK settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the three
eighths pole but faded past the five sixteenths. LIGHTNING ROUND drifted to the four path into the first turn, raced outside into the backstretch and was not

pressured the pace and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, dueled for the nod through the upper stretch but was caught in the final
yards. TALKING TEDDY was hustled along to set a pressured early pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, was met into the lane and ceded
the nod nearing the sixteenth pole. DOC ELM chased, rounded the turn in the three path and finished evenly. SWISS LEGACY gave chase well off the rail,
rounded the turn about the four path and ran evenly in the stretch. HAPPY YEARS gave distant chase, ran in the five path of the turn and showed little
further. REY O REYES gave chase, ran at the rail on the turn then weakened.

Footnotes
COWGIRL NIGHT settled off the rail on the first turn, eased out with a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail, dug in from
the top of the stretch to take over late and just held on to share the win with TONALA, who saved ground off the pace on the first turn, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, angled outward past the eighth pole and dug in to get up at the wire. HARD CHANT stalked the early pace two
deep, challenged and took the lead leaving the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, was steadily encouraged from the head of the lane but was
caught flattening stride late stretch. OUT OF ROMANCE rated close inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole then flattened at the rail on the far turn.
DAMISELA rounded the opening turn about the four path, left the turn outside and showed little response. U R THE LUCKY ONE rated a short lead inside,
was caught leaving the three eighths pole and faded readily. VOLNAY stumbled and lost her jock leaving the gate. The Stewards posted the inquiry to
review the start of this race. In addition, the three quarter mile and the finish times were hand timed due to the loose horse breaking those beams first.
