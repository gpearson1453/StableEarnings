Footnotes
PAPER MANSION stalked two or three wide, chased the leader on the turn, rallied two wide into the stretch, gained command and edged away under
urging. SMARTY PANTS SANDY raced off the pace, chased on the turn, rallied outside in the lane and came up second best. MOONCHILD raced two wide
off the pace, moved up at the quarter pole, closed well late outside and was along for the show spot. NYSSA quickly showed in front, set the pace racing
with a clear lead, dug in turning for home and weakened in the final furlong. NO SYMPATHY bobbled at the break, raced off the pace inside and failed to
threaten. EMMA'S TOUCH reluctant to load, raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. MARTINI TWIST tracked on the inside, chased on the turn
and faded.

Footnotes
WE BE THERE firmly rated off the pace, bid wide before half a mile, collared the pacesetter, alternated with the advantage and was up after a long drive.
GREEN GROWTH vied in the two path then moved clear inside into the far turn, was engaged on the turn and continued gamely to the finish. SLEW TANG
CLAN saved ground off the pace, angled wide in the stretch and closed well. MOUNTAIN TREE settled off the leaders outside, made a brief bidon the turn
then flattened out. MITHRA lagged far behind inside and passed fading rivals. RISING STORM dropped back early and lacked a rally. NIANGUA raced wide
throughout and was never a factor. YEI YEI led briefly inside, was close up for half a mile and stopped.

SON OF A SAINT raced three wide early, stalked close up three wide, pressed the pace, bid on the far turn, dueled with SUPERHIGHWAY, wore down that
rival nearing the furlong marker and pulled away under urging. BIG CITY RALPH raced four wide early, settled off the pace, chased the leaders on the far
turn, rallied and finished well for the place spot. TERRY'S CHARM raced off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied mildly outside and was along
for third. SUPERHIGHWAY vied two wide for the lead, took over on the backside, dueled inside of the winner on the far turn, dug in gamely and weakened
in the final sixteenth. POLITICAL raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. CLASSIFIED INFO vied inside for the early lead, then tracked and faded.

COBBLE ROAD quickly sprinted clear, was collared into the stretch, battled the remainder of the trip and held on determinedly. HARD STING pursued the
pacesetter inside, angled out on the final turn, reached even terms but could not get by the winner. EDDIE'S CHARGE dropped far behind before half a mile
then came again for the show. RONIN WARRIOR raced wide throughout, moved closer on the final turn then faltered. THE ANGRY MAN chased within
range in the two path and weakened steadily. RELISHMENT was taken up between rivals near the 5 1/2 furlong pole and gave way.
