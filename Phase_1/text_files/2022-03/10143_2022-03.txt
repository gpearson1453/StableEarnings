Footnotes
THE THREE KS set a clear pace while rating along well in hand, then drew off entering the lane. WE NEED A FIVE stalked the clear leader from the
outside, but failed to keep pace with him entering the lane, then saved place between horses. SHACKLE THE GOLD stalked along the inside, then chased
along the rail through the lane, but just missed reaching place. FORT BONZ took a bump from an inner foe at the start, tracked in midpack three wide,
chased under urging around the far turn, then kept on in pursuit of place in the final furlong, but missed in the photo finish. I LIKE DREAMING tracked in
midpack along the inside, then two wide into the far turn, tipped four wide in midstretch, but lacked a kick while hanging on his left lead. I DON'T FLY
COACH saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. MISTA VALENTINE broke a step slowly and leaned into an outer rival at the start, laid off of the
pace two wide, retreated to trail the field into the far turn, and failed to factor. GRAND PRIORITY broke a beat slowly, trailed in the three path early on, and
never got involved. BAYOU SARGE took both turns in the four path while far off of the pace, and made little impact THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION
WAS HAND-TIMED

Footnotes
PI YO PRINCESS laid off of the pace in the two path, swung to the five path at the quarter pole, rallied outside of rivals, and reeled in the leader in the
closing stages. ANGIE AT THEOFFICE stalked outside of the clear leader, ranged up entering the lane to bid in upper stretch, led at the furlong grounds,
cleared soon after, but was worn down by an outer rival a few strides from home. LILLIE AND NAN rushed to clear inner foes at the nine-sixteenths pole,
met ANGIE AT THEOFFICE's bid in upper stretch, got headed at the furlong grounds, and gave way. PALACE MAGIC took a bump from an inner foe at the
start, tracked four wide around the turn, but was outkicked for show at the furlong grounds while chasing mildly. HIGHER NOTE stalked along the inside, but
failed to progress through the lane. LUMBERJACK EMPIRE bumped an outer foe at the start, and failed to factor. SONGS DISCREET CAT broke sharply,
tracked three wide around the turn, but tired. FEATURED POWER trailed and never got involved. HEART OF INDEE laid off of the pace in the three path,
and tired around the turn.

MALIBU MARIE stalked outside of the pace setter, bid for the lead into the far turn, led leaving the three furlong pole, then held firmly through the lane as
her inner counterpart fought on, and inched away late. CHARDONNAY set the pace along the inside, but was headed by an outer rival at the three furlong
pole, fought on gallantly through the lane, but was second best. TALEOFREADYCHIANTI tracked along the inside, chased the top pair from the three path
around the far turn, but lacked a bid. HIDDEN WONDER was outrun.

Footnotes
EAST LEX saved ground while rating off of the pace, shifted to the six path at the quarter pole, mildly bumped an outer foe while shifting to the seven path in
midstretch, then surged between rivals in the final furlong, and forged an advantage late. ZOFFA trailed in the two path, moved forward between horses
down the backstretch to track two to three wide around the far turn, tipped to the six path at the quarter pole, rallied on his left lead to bid at the furlong
grounds, led passing that marker, but was caught in the final sixteenth, and saved place. LAKE NAKURU leaned outwardly at the start, settled far back in
the four path, trailed in the three path around the far turn, swung to the seven path entering the lane, got brushed to the eight path by an inner foe at the
furlong grounds, flopped back to his left lead while getting outkicked approaching the final sixteenth, then stayed on, but missed reaching place. TIO BLAS
stalked along the inside, got rank in the two path at the eleven sixteenths pole before an inner foe moved along side, then tipped to the four path at the
quarter pole, but only managed to chase evenly, and lacked a kick to produce a bid. CITADEL laid off of the pace in the three path, fanned to the seven path
entering the backstretch, rallied in the four path and outside of the leading trio around the far turn before drifting to the five path entering the lane, vied
through upper stretch, but was outkicked at the furlong grounds, and tired. IMMORTAL tracked two wide, tucked to the rail approaching the backstretch,
stalked into and around the far turn, but was stymied behind the pace setters through upper stretch, shifted outwardly approaching the final furlong, then
stayed on once clear. ONE TIME GEM prompted the pace while being floated to the six path into the first turn, tucked to the four path around that bend
while vying outside of BODE'S LIGHT, contended down the backstretch, then from between horses around the far turn, but was outkicked approaching the
furlong grounds, and faltered. SMOKEY HARBOR got floated to the five path while prominent between horses into the first turn, rated back to stalk in the
three path around that bend, ranged up three wide and between horses around the far turn, vied among foes through upper stretch, but weakened
approaching the furlong grounds. BODE'S LIGHT vied along the inside, but pulled while drifting to the four path entering the first turn, remained rank while
setting the pace around that bend, but settled before showing the way from a trio of outer foes turning for home, then weakened in upper stretch.
VINCITORE tracked in midpack in the four to six path entering the backstretch, but faded between horses at the half mile pole, and further weakened
entering the lane.

Footnotes
DRILLING REPORT set the pace along the inside, was firmly restrained entering the backstretch as outer foes closed in, but maintained an advantage,
showed the way before being set down turning for home as MARTINIZED menaced alongside, then kicked clear of that foe at the three sixteenths pole, and
drew off. IT'S A BIRD prompted the pace two wide, chased the leader around the far turn, failed to keep pace with that rival and outer bidding foes turning
for home, but kept on in the final furlong with a rail chase, and regained place in the late stages. CAMEO DANCER tracked four wide, ranged up to the
leading pair turning for home, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, then stayed on mildly to bid for place entering the final sixteenth, but was outfinished
by an inner foe for that position. MARTINIZED stalked three wide, bid for the lead two wide at the five sixteenths pole, vied entering the lane, but was turned
away at the three sixteenths pole, and tired between horses in the late stages. DUSTY BOY laid off of the pace along the inside, swung five wide and
outside of leading foes in upper stretch, and failed to threaten. OUR BLUE JAY laid off of the pace two wide, and failed to menace. CHARLIES TICKET
trailed, but was through approaching the lane, and eased through it.

Footnotes
ON YOUR MARK was bumped by an inner foe at the start, rated off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide while picking up stride entering the lane, rallied
to take aim on the clear leader in midstretch, reeled that rival in the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage late. COMPLEX SYSTEM set a clear pace, held
sway into the final furlong as ON YOUR MARK pursued, resisted that foe's bid entering the final sixteenth, but was bested in the late stages. SCHMOOZIN
settled far back three wide, tipped five wide entering the lane, and stayed on late to gain a minor share. LOMU brushed with an outer foe in the early stages,
then checked behind that troubled rival into the turn, took the bend, two wide while settled off of the pace, failed to progress through upper stretch, then
shifted four wide and between horses at the furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead, and moved up. READY TO ROLL stalked three to two wide into
the turn, came into the lane in the three path, but was outkicked by an outer foe while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, changed over leaving the
furlong grounds, but yielded between horses late. BIG BOBBY BROWN came out at the start and bumped a foe, stalked two wide, tucked to the rail into the
turn and put TWIRLING ROSES into tight quarters, then chased the clear leader in upper stretch before fading late. TWIRLING ROSES brushed with an
inner foe early on, moved forward to stalk along the inside, but steadied at the nine-sixteenths pole when put to tight quarters by an outer foe, then saved
ground around the turn, but failed to factor. LONG AND STRONG trailed in the four path around the turn, swung six wide entering the lane, and made little
impact.

Footnotes
NASHVILLE quickly established a large margin, came under mild coaxing approaching the final furlong while still well clear, and was ridden out under light
hand urging entering the final sixteenth. LONG WEEKEND brushed the gate while breaking a step slowly, then received a solid bump from an outer rival
soon after, laid well off of the pace along the inside, rallied along the rail through the lane, and reached place entering the final sixteenth, but failed to
threaten the leader. DIGITAL stalked along the inside, chased the clear leader from the two path as that foe's closest pursuer, proved no match while drifting
out slightly from left handed urging through upper stretch, then lost place to an inner rival a sixteenth from home. PERFECT SPEIGHTY trailed in the three
path around the turn, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and failed to menace while improving. SOUNION brushed an outer rival before squarely
knocking into an inner foe shortly after the start, took the turn in the three path far back, swung to the six path entering the lane, and failed to factor. EBBEN
stalked outside of a foe while in the three path and far off of the clear leader, then tired in the five path entering the lane.

Footnotes
HIGH DEFF (FR) settled off of the pace in the three path, tipped to the four path around the far turn, then to the six path entering the lane, rallied to take aim
on a clear CASH ROCKET entering the final furlong, reeled in that drifting foe entering the final sixteenth, and edged away. CASH ROCKET bobbled and
bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside while remaining a path off of the inner railing, took aim on the clear leader from the three path
around the far turn, tipped to the four path entering the lane before ranging up to that foe while well in hand, led at the three sixteenths pole, inched clear at
the furlong grounds as HIGH DEFF (FR) pursued, but drifted outwardly shortly after, flopped back to his left lead as the aforementioned rival bid entering the
final sixteenth, and was bested. SAILOR'S RETURN trailed in the three path, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and rallied willingly. TIWANAKU
tracked from midpack two wide, gained in the five path and outside of foes turning for home, but leveled off and got outkicked by outer rivals while hanging
on his left lead in upper stretch, then stayed on mildly. BLUE BONZAI took a bump from an inner foe at the start, saved ground in midpack, grinded away
along the rail through the lane to vie for show inside of foes in midstretch, but flattened out late. FLAT OUT AMERICAN bumped with an outer rival at the
start, pulled clear, to a wide lead in the four path around the first turn, saw his margin narrow while in the three path around the far turn, then weakened
between horses at the three sixteenths pole. PORT ROYAL bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked two wide from the three path, then in the four path
around the far turn, but faded between horses turning for home. LOCO broke inwardly at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but was outrun
through the lane.

Footnotes
SHELLI'S ANGEL stalked along the inside, claimed place from an outer rival while tipping outside of the clear leader at the furlong grounds, took aim, rallied
late, and reached that foe late. GRACELEADSUSHOME set the pace along the inside, met a pair of bids turning or home, shook clear of those foes at the
quarter pole, held sway through midstretch, but was worn down late. A G'S CHARLOTTE pressed the pace two wide and from between horses, bid turning
for home along with an outer foe, but was repelled at the quarter pole, and yielded. START WELL stalked three wide, bid at the three furlong pole, but failed
to keep pace entering the lane, and faded. AKIANE'S SOLDIER laid far back in the three path, then saved ground around the far turn, and moved up in
upper stretch. THE GREY BEAUTY hesitated at the start and trailed the field early on, improved to a tracking position down the backstretch, attempted to
range up outside of the leading trio turning for home, but drifted to the six path entering the lane while flattening out, lugged inwardly in upper stretch and
tired. AVERI EVER AFTER never got involved. ZEATRICAL broke outwardly, raced forwardly in the five path early on, but was done early, and eased
through the lane.
