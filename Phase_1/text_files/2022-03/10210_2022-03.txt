Footnotes
DIAL A LADY tracked close up on the inside, bid two wide on the turn, dueled, gained a short lead, drew clear under urging in the stretch run and was in
hand the final yards. STONEHARBOR BLONDE vied inside for the early lead, dueled with the winner on the turn, was no match for that rival and held well
for the place spot. RISEN CHANGE stalked outside a rival, chased on the turn and rallied mildly in the stretch. AMERICAN MONEY stumbled badly at the
start, raced two wide off the pace, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. LIAM'S LADY vied outside for the early lead, chased on the turn and
faded. PRESTO CHANGE O was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside and did not factor. HAPPY LOUDON raced close up in the early stages, then
dropped back readily and gave way.

earned a narrow lead outside, vied through the final turn and fought back gamely. JADE DELTA dropped back early, rallied outside then flattened out in the
stretch. GET HER READYEDDIE was well placed behind the dueling leaders then proved empty in the stretch. SO GRACIOUS lacked speed, faded before
half a mile and continued to be no factor. SOLEMN OATH forced the pace along the inside for half a mile and gave way.

wide on the turn, closed mildly outside in the stretch and was along for the show spot. HARD WEST raced four wide early, moved up between rivals on the
turn, came three wide into the lane and finished evenly. THE BIG BLUFF raced off the rail, off the pace, went three wide on the turn and bested the others.
LOVERBOY LOU raced off the pace between rivals and failed to threaten. GENGHIS chased close up three wide, chased on the turn and tired. ANZIO
