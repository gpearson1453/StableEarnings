PERFETTO pressed the early pace, rallied at the quarter pole, drew off in the stretch under steady urging to win as much the best. GUCCISSIMO was
never far back on the inside, angled out in the stretch, was no match for the winner but was second best. GOTSOMEMOJO was unhurried early, had a mild
bid, on the inside. RED BLUE AND TRUE set the pace with a clear lead and faltered in the stretch. ALGORIX chased the early speed and tired in the
stretch. BUCKY contended for three quarters, then gave way.
