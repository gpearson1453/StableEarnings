Footnotes
SYNC was bumped by SIERRA SNOW STORM at the break and subsequently bumped EVEN STEVEN at the start, stalked the pace outside of rivals,
mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, headed GOLDEN TRIBUTE nearing the furlong grounds, dueled with that foe and dug in in the final strides to
prevail. GOLDEN TRIBUTE was hustled leaving the break and set a contested pace into the second turn, was confronted by SYNC nearing the furlong
marker, met the bid of that rival, dueled to the wire and was gamely bested in the end, while clear of the rest. YOU'RE THE CAUSE saved ground while
stalking the pace, advanced in upper stretch and was outkicked by the top pair, while clear of the rest for third. EVEN STEVEN was bothered by SYNC at
the break and was away slowly, was unhurried through the backstretch run, was steered four wide on the far turn and did not offer a late rally. SIERRA
SNOW STORM broke out at the start and bothered SYNC at the break, settled off of the early pace, lacked a late response and was not a factor. MORPHY
was off alertly, pressed the hustled GOLDEN TRIBUTE through the second turn, lost ground into the stretch run and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
SHEZARUNAWAY stalked the pace while saving all of the ground, advanced in upper stretch along the rail, took command inside of the furlong marker and
edged clear in the final stages. HERE COMES RALPHIE settled just off of the pace, mounted a five wide rally into the stretch run, closed on her left lead in
the late stages and was outfinished by the winner but kept on to secure second. TORQUAY stalked the early pace, gained ground four wide into the drive,
vied for the lead at the furlong marker and was outkicked in the late stages, while holding for third. HOLY ZAGS settled off of the pace, was roused six wide
into the stretch run, closed in the late stages but needed more in the end. TURA LURA stalked the moderate fractions, advanced to vie for the lead
approaching the furlong marker but was outfinished in the final stages. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) was allowed to settle, was three wide along the first turn,
was steered four wide on the second turn, swung seven wide into the stretch run and was not a late factor. EDDIE'S SISTER broke alertly and was sent to
the front, set moderate fractions while extending the lead into the far turn, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
WORD OF WARNING chased the pace, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch run, closed inside of the furlong marker, took command in the final
sixteenth, inched clear in the end and drifted out a bit approaching the wire. YOU'RE MY BOY KAT was forwardly placed while saving ground, rallied in
upper stretch, vied for the lead inside of the sixteenth-marker and was outfinished by the winner but kept on for the place. SPLIT ACES stalked the pace two
wide through the turn, closed on the tiring pacesetter in mid-stretch and was outkicked by the top pair in the end. BLUE SILVER chased the pace from the
inside and made a mild late gain in the stretch. WESTERN SIERRA was away well and set the pace while opening a clear lead, was caught nearing the
sixteenth-marker and tired in the final stages. TOO TALL TO CALL was bothered by UNCLE DANNY at the start and was away slowly, lacked early speed,
swung widest into the drive and finished evenly in the late going. THECHIEFHASTRICKS chased the pace four wide on the turn and weakened in the late
stages. UNCLE DANNY broke in a tangle at the start and bothered TOO TALL TO CALL, lacked speed through the turn and did not offer a late bid.

Footnotes
DESERT DUDE took command of the early pace and set pedestrian fractions while being prompted into the second turn, shook clear of the prompting rival
into the drive and kicked clear in the end. LINFIELD was unhurried in the early going, was steered five wide nearing the quarter-marker, closed in the late
stages, could not reel in the winner in the end but was a clear second. UPO saved all of the ground while stalking the pace, was outfinished in the stretch
run by the top pair but held safely in the end for third. GEE GEE WHIZ was allowed to settle, advanced in upper stretch to come within range nearing the
furlong grounds but lacked a final response. FOUR O'FIVE prompted the pedestrian early pace, lost ground into the stretch run and tired in the final stages.
EROTIC stalked the pace, gained ground four wide on the second turn and weakened in the stretch. GOBSMACK settled off of the pace while saving
ground, was steered five wide on the second turn and was not a factor. HONG KONG COWBOY was floated five wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed
through the second turn and gave way in the drive.

the win. MIRACLE IN MOTION showed good early speed while setting moderately quick fractions, felt pressure from HOT ROCKETTE in the final furlong,
was able to hold that foe at bay until the final stages and was tagged at the wire for the win. BIG JOLT saved ground while tracking the pace, was outkicked
by the top pair in the final furlong but kept on to be a clear third. FIRST TIME PLAYER was forwardly placed while stalking the moderately quick pace, lost
ground into the stretch and faltered in the late going. CRY ME A RUNNER broke in the air at the start, recovered to chased the pace from the inside through
the turn and weakened in the stretch drive. GETAWAY CHARM chased the pace four wide on the turn and tired in the stretch run. HILLSDALE NATION was
bumped by CLIPPERVILE GIRL at the start, lacked early speed, mounted a five wide bid into the drive but flattened out in that effort in the late stages.
CLIPPERVILE GIRL bumped HILLSDALE NATION at the break, chased the early pace two wide through the turn and gave way in the stretch run. ALY'S

Footnotes
CHIEFTAIN'S LADY broke alertly and cleared the field into the first turn, set the pace while being prompted by the runner-up, extended the lead in upper
stretch and held safely in the end. STYLEDOME (IRE) tracked the pace, closed on the winner nearing the quarter-marker, lost ground nearing the furlong
marker, was again able to mildly gain on the winner in the final stages but could not reel that foe in and was outfinished while clear of the rest for the place.
SHE'S SO PRETTY settled off of the pace, advanced three wide on the second turn but was unable to muster the needed late response. SUMMER
APPARITION saved ground while stalking the pace, improved position along the far turn but was outkicked in the stretch run. JUSTA POPPIN was forwardly
placed in the early stages, was steered four wide between rivals on the second turn and tired in the drive. MALIBU JEWEL settled just off of the pace, was
three wide on the first turn, gained ground five wide on the far turn but weakened in the stretch drive. ESCAPE THE CITY (GB) was unhurried in the early
stages, saved ground into the second turn and did not mount a late rally. FIRE DIAMONDS was four wide along the first turn, settled off of the pace through
the backstretch run, shifted inside along the second turn and was not a factor.

QUEEN OF THE TRACK tracked the fast pace, was roused leaving the quarter-marker while three wide, confronted ALLIE'S PAL nearing the furlong
marker, took command into the final furlong, felt late pressure from the runner-up and third placed rival and just lasted for the win. HOT RAGEOUS stalked
the fast pace two wide through the turn, made a steady advance in the final furlong, closed in the final strides and just missed for the win while getting the
nod for second. CROWN KITTEN settled off of the pace while saving ground, advanced in upper stretch, continued that run inside of the final furlong,
angled out with a sixteenth to go, closed fast and just missed for the win and place. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP saved ground while just off of the early pace,
bobbled a bit and came out a path leaving the three-eighths marker while bothering GAYLES EVENING, gained ground into the stretch run, kept on with
that bid in the final stages but could not reel in the top three. ALLIE'S PAL was away sharply from the gate, set fast fractions through the turn, came under
pressure nearing the furlong grounds, was caught inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished in the late stages. EYE ON TIGER chased the fast pace
three wide on the turn, lost ground into the drive, improved in the final stages but lacked a final kick. GAYLES EVENING chased the pace three wide into the
turn, steadied in traffic leaving the three-eighths marker when CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP came out a path and made a mild late gain in the stretch. MAYCEE
JO chased the pace outside of rivals, steadied leaving the three furlong marker in tight traffic and did not have a late response. TRINA stumbled badly at the
start and was away slowly, was outrun into the turn and was not a factor.
