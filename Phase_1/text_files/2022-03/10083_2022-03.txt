Footnotes
SUMMER SHANDEE saved ground around the first turn and tracked two wide up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide through the far turn, angled
inside with a furlong remaining and drew clear. SONIC KITTEN prompted the pace through early stages, dueled around the far turn, shook free to a slim
lead in the upper stretch then got outkicked late. POETIC CODE raced in range just off the top flight, dueled for command around the final turn, could not
match strides in the stretch run but sustained a steady bid and secured a share. MUNGER bumped with rival just after the start and raced in the back,
continued reserved in the back, picked up the pace late on the far turn, launched a five wide bid into the lane and finished with interest. WIZARD SERRAT
rated near midpack up the backstretch, was ridden along four wide into the upper stretch, showed interest but needed more for impact. JUST PRAISE raced
five paths wide heading into the first turn, settled through early stages, was hustled along four wide around the far turn and lacked a needed rally.
MUROMEC got bumped at the start, was rated between foes never far back, ridden along the inside around the final turn, tipped two wide for the drive and
failed to move on. ONE MORE DAY settled and saved ground, was ridden along three wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.
DRINKSONTHEBEACH prompted the early pace, dueled around the final turn then faded while the saddle slipped back in the lane. MACHO TIME raced
two wide around the first turn, settled off the pace and failed to move into contention. CASSIDYS GOLD saved ground and never menaced. UNICO set a
pressured pace up the backstretch and came up empty around the final turn.

Footnotes
COLONIST was a step slow to begin, lagged in the second flight widest up the backstretch, came four wide rallying off the far turn, wrested command on the
far outside through midstretch and drove clear. CALORIC was put to pressure on the far turn two then three wide, bid between horses through upper
stretch, and came up second best. MIRACLE SILVER pressed BATTLE OF BLENHEIM from outside, bid for command on the far turn, and stayed on to the
furlong grounds before giving way. GOLDEN DECISION was no threat two to three wide. TIL THE END broke slowest and never became a factor toward
the inside. BATTLE OF BLENHEIM set a pressured pace inside for six furlongs, and gave way through the lane. AMBASSADOR JIM saved ground in range
for six furlongs, and tired.

Footnotes
ATOMIC ROSE settled off the pace outside, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed outside and was up late. HOLIDAY PRINCESS vied three wide
down the backstretch, drew clear in the two path around the turn, widened in upper stretch and led until deep stretch. MORE GLORY lacked early speed,
raced mostly five wide around the turn and finished well to gain the show. NOBODY'S SECRET stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the quarter pole
and faded through the lane. MISS YOUNIVERSE failed to menace while racing two wide. CROOKLYN played no factor while racing five wide. SHE IS
ROYALTY was outrun inside. THE CUBAN MISSILE vied inside foes early, chased inside around the turn and retreated nearing the lane. ALWAYS A
PARTY led between foes early and was through after a half.

Footnotes
INEVITABLE ME cleared soon after the start and angled inside, led through early stages, dueled with CELESTIAL GLAZE around the turn then shook free
to a slim lead, dug in gamely under a left-handed drive and held clear. ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS raced up close in opening stages then flattened out a bit
around the turn, launched a rebid along the rail in the lane, finished willingly and got a head up for place. CELESTIAL GLAZE angled over from the outside
in opening stages, dueled with the winner around the turn, continued in striking distance through the lane and got caught for place. BOURBON OVER ICE
got pushed sideways at the start then got in a bit tight and steadied just after opening stages, roused forward to race off the top pair around the turn, ran on
three to four wide in the lane and lacked the needed surge for serious impact. GREEN DOT BRAH saved ground through early stages, shifted out five wide
in the upper stretch and had a mild improve. INNER WAVE got jostled between rivals near the half mile marker, chased three wide going by the quarter
pole, stayed on two wide in the lane and lacked a needed rally. PEMBERTON got pushed inward and lost a few strides at the start, saved ground in the
back and passed tiring rivals in the lane. REGIO was not far back chasing two wide in early stages then flattened out in the lane. ARIES REIGNS veered
inward at the start, raced off the pace, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MAGIC PRO was not far back in the early stages and bumped
with rival near the half mile marker, flattened around the turn and had no late response. SEND D PACKAGE bumped with rival nearing the turn and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
I'M LISTENING prompted the pace outside ODRAMARK, bid for command between horses after six furlongs, reached a short lead in upper stretch and
edged away, then held FLYING BLACK safe late. FLYING BLACK was three wide early, ranged up to contention four wide with a quarter-mile remaining,
had aim outside I'M LISTENING through the late stages and finished willingly. SERENADE A KITTEN settled in midpack three wide to the far turn, moved in
tightening things up on SMART SPENDING at the top of the stretch, and finished evenly. ODRAMARK set the pace inside, could not hold off I'M
LISTENING into the stretch, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. MIDNIGHT BELLA was in tight between horses and bobbled slightly going to
the first turn, came three wide for the drive and lacked a solid closing response. SMART SPENDING saved ground on the turns, steadied inside
SERENADE A KITTEN at the top of the stretch, and faded. ANTIGONE was in bit tight along the rail to the first turn, and tired before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
RIOT HOUSE led early, settled back into a stalking position when KHUFU was intent on the lead around the first turn, re-bid two wide nearing the lane, took
over near the eighth pole, edged away from the pacesetter and dug in to hold off CAUSIN' MAYHEM's inside bid. CAUSIN' MAYHEM tracked the pace two
and three wide, angled in nearing the lane, rallied inside of the winner and just missed. KHUFU advanced two wide to the lead, cleared midway around the
first turn, set the pace inside to midstretch and weakened. ANALOGY went evenly while racing three and four wide. WATASHA chased the pace inside and
lacked a closing bid. GUARD OF HONOUR was bumped hard and appeared to clip heels nearing the first turn, raced three wide and never threatened.
DOMINANT DESTROYER failed to menace while racing three wide. SURGING was outrun inside. LIAM'S BLUE MOON bumped nearing the first turn,
raced two wide and made no further impact. THE STEWARD CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY BUT FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER
OF FINISH. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH RUN-UP AND FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
OBLIGATORY came away last and settled four wide in the back, prompted and quickly advanced into contention late on the turn, launched a three wide bid
for BRAMBLE BERRY at the head of the lane, responded willingly under right-handed pressure, surged to the lead and finished going away. BRAMBLE
BERRY sped to the lead soon after the start and set the early pace, held clear racing through the turn, was ridden along two wide into the lane, stayed on
with response but could not contain the winner in late stages. FOUR GRACES tracked the pace three to four wide, hustled up around the turn, sustained a
steady outside bid through the lane and cleared the rest. FEELING MISCHIEF angled to the inside soon after the start and saved ground, came under a ride
along the rail leaving the turn, briefly responded then flattened out. STARSHIP NALA was forwardly placed racing behind the leader, chased three wide
around the turn then weakened in the drive. MY DESTINY raced in range through early stages, was ridden along four wide through the turn then faded in
the lane.

Footnotes
MEGAYACHT advanced to contention three wide on the final turn, finished determinedly outside MALTHAEL and wore that rival down in the closing yards.
MALTHAEL dropped back through the middle stages, rallied four wide on the final bend, kicked clear turning into the stretch, then could not withstand the
top one late. ARTURO TOSCANINI (IRE) saved ground for the first mile or so, improved position on the final turn four wide, and rallied mildly to go clear for
the show. SHADY MCGEE (IRE) raced three wide, took over on the final turn briefly, relinquished the lead to MALTHAEL at the top of the stretch, and
faded. JIMMY D raced in the second flight and made no impact. ANOTHER DUKE prompted the pace outside for a mile, and tired. CALL CURT raced four
wide early, and tired after a mile. RISK MANAGER set the pace inside for a mile, and gave way nearing the stretch. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED,
FRACTIONS ADDED AND FINAL CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
UNIKEE tracked the pace two wide, angled out and made light contact with CAPE TRAFALGER turning for home, reeled in the pacesetter leaving the
eighth pole and drew clear. CAPE TRAFALGAR raced off the early pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, angled in nearing the lane, was
pushed out in upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner but stayed on to gain the place. UNDER OATH set the pace along the rail and
weakened in the final sixteenth. STAY RESTLESS was up close inside, angled out in the stretch and came up empty. EMIRATES ROAD never threatened
while racing five wide. PROVEN HOPE lacked early speed, advanced six wide around the turn and failed to sustain that bid in the lane. WIND AT MY BACK
failed to menace while racing three wide around the turn and along the rail through the stretch. OCOTZINGO was reluctant to load, chased the pace three
wide and faltered after a half. DOUBLE PLAY KING pressed the pace two wide and retreated through the lane. LAW OF THE JUNGLE was off slow and
outrun while saving ground and swing out turning for home. MAJORITY PARTNER hit the starting gate, raced four wide and was never a factor. FREDO
popped open the gate prior to the start but was unable to escape the assistant starter, hit the gate at the start, saved ground and was through early. THE
STEWARD CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY AND REVIEWED AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF CAPE TRAFALGER AGAINST THE WINNER FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH AND TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
HEADLINE HUNTER applied outside pressure to MISS AURAMET in early stages, dueled two wide around the turn, dug in gamely with a furlong left to run,
wrested the advantage and widened under firm handling. MISS AURAMET sped to the lead soon after the start and led the way under pressure from
HEADLINE HUNTER, matched strides with rival racing through the turn, battled back from the inside to mid-stretch then failed to kick on with the winner and
stayed on for second best. MISS J MCKAY tracked the embattled pair around the turn, prompted three wide at the head of the lane, sustained steady
response and finished well clear over the rest. LA LIBERTEE came away last and settled through opening stages, hustled along two wide around the turn,
shifted out four wide at the head of the lane and lacked a rally. BERNIE'S MISTRESS briefly responded along the inside then weakened around the turn,
steadied approaching the head of the lane and continued to tire in the drive. NAUGHTY SHIRLEY got pulled up late on the turn and vanned off after the
race.

GHOSTLORE went along unhurried and off the rail early, moved swiftly to join the front flight three wide between horses after six furlongs, kicked clear and
moved inside through upper stretch, and was under a mild drive to the sixteenth-pole before being geared down. CRITICAL THREAT raced four to three
wide around the turn, dropped back into the stretch, then came on again late to get the runner-up spot. CREATE AGAIN vied inside PERFECT SILENT CAT
for six furlongs, was no match for the winner once straightened away for the drive, and weakened. CAXAMBAS CANDY moved out five wide approaching
the stretch, and had no closing response. REBELDE was no factor two to three wide. PERFECT SILENT CAT contested the pace outside CREATE AGAIN
for six furlongs, and tired. LUDINGTON eyed the battling leaders into the turn, and faded steadily after six furlongs.

Footnotes
KEEN KINGDOM settled off the pace while racing four wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, moved to the front in midstretch and drew clear under
steady urging. SANDPIPER MEMORIES was fractious in the gate, pressed the pace two wide, took the lead between foes near the quarter pole, vied
between past the eighth pole, was no match for the winner late and lasted for the place. STRONG EMBRACE saved ground well off the pace, rallied inside
while lacking a clear path, angled out late and gained between to just miss second. MANDY GREEN was in range while racing three wide between foes
around both turns, angled widest in upper stretch and was one-paced through the lane to just miss third. OMIXOCHITL was in range inside and lacked a
closing bid. HATARI failed to menace while racing three and four wide. ITS A BIRDIE set the pace along the rail, fought on inside when initially collared late
on the far turn but tired through the final furlong. BRITTIZ steadied midway around the first turn, raced off the pace two wide and three wide and never
threatened. FISH MOONEY trailed in the three path early, advanced five wide around the far turn and faded through the lane. UP HER SLEEVE tracked the
pace three wide, steadied between foes midway around the far turn and retreated.
