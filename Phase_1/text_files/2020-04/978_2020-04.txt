Footnotes
LADY CLEOPATRA broke on top, got clear before a quarter, larger lead the middle half while rating, continued to hold a comfortable advantage past the
furlong marker, enough left to withstand a late run from the runner up. SHE MIGHT TELL last away, fell well back, continued to trail into the far turn, angled
out four wide turning for home, finished willingly down the middle of the strip to be rapidly getting to the winner. MOONLIGHT TRAIN four wide into the first
turn, settled in the three path, lacked a winning response in the drive to finish up evenly. OPERATIC void of early foot, three wide through the second turn
when improving, flattened out a bit in the drive. GRATS ROAD raced in mid pack while saving ground, steered out three wide for the drive, came up empty.
CHECK SIX lacked speed, moved out to the two path late in the first turn, failed to respond when called on for the drive. BELLA ALICITA forwardly placed
early off the inside, steered out to the three path first turn, chased the winner up the back stretch and into the far turn then began to weaken.
CONFORMATION within striking distance in the early going off the inside, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
FRONTIER WOMAN broke back, saved ground, advanced through the turn along the rail, steered out a bit, took over when straightened for home, drove
steadily clear. HEART RIVER lacked speed while three wide into the turn, in the two path and between horses into the lane, rallied for the place, no match
for the winner. TRACI'S GREELEY settled in the pack, raced in the two path through the bend, did not have enough for the place, clear of the rest. FAIRY
void of early foot, steered out to be five wide turning for home, finished willingly well out in the strip while too late. JUST FOR CASEY in the second flight off
the inside, four wide exiting the turn, lacked a closing punch. STARVANA back off the pace well out in the strip, five wide through the turn, went evenly
through the stretch. WESTERN ATTIRE off the pace just off the rail, in some traffic late backstretch, improved a bit into the lane, lacked further rally.
PERFECT RUSH moved up to contest the issue soon after the start, narrowly set the pace for a half, faltered when headed by the winner upper stretch.
ATHENASWAY fractious while loading, last to leave, trailed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while remaining back. BE AUTHENTIC failed to menace.
VEGAN GOES BEST vied up front from the outside, three down to two wide in the turn, gave way in the drive. TAP AND SPIN forwardly placed for a half,
stopped.

Footnotes
MAKE NOISE stalked the pace while racing off the inside, continued to pursue the leader up the backstretch, took over from that one midway on the final
turn, larger lead into lane, responded when challenged past the furlong marker, dueled to the wire, dug in late in game fashion to prevail. FRA MAURO
settled off the pace and the inside, advanced into the stretch in the two path, engaged the winner from the outside with a furlong remaining, dueled to the
end, outfinished. CANDY STORE settled off the pace and the inside, went evenly in lacking a closing kick. SOLOMONIC also went one paced in failing to
muster a closing response. SACRED OATH tucked in a bit to save some ground early in the first turn, three wide second turn, lacked serious response.
PARADE FIELD made little impact toward the inside. LNGTERMRELATIONSHP last away, trailed most of the way. ASTROLOGER sprinted clear past the
wire the first time, set the pace inside, faltered when headed by the winner in the second turn.

Footnotes
PRIVATE LAKE within striking distance early outside, prompted the issue four wide through the turn, bid, kicked well clear. J'S LITTLE MAN with the pace
while racing three wide, put a head in front nearing the furlong grounds, lost the advantage to the winner soon after, proved no threat to that foe while clear
of the others. BOO BE RIGHT in the second flight while three wide into and through the turn, dropped inside when straightened for home, finished up best of
the rest while unable to do much with the top two the final furlong. RICH ICON void of speed outside, four wide through the turn, staged a mild rally through
the stretch while remaining well out in the strip. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY off slowly, raced back and outside, five wide into the stretch, improved position while
also well wide through the lane. BLACKS FERRY ROAD back off the pace and the inside, three wide through the turn, lacked a significant response in the
drive to finish up evenly. JAMES'S MOONSHINE off a step slow, moved up in the two path up the backstretch, angled out to be four wide turning for home,
weakened in the final furlong. PAPA STAR vied up front while between rivals for a half, tired through the stretch. EXOTIC PEGASUS in the second flight
toward the inside, came up empty for the drive. LIME TREE VALLEY remained always back. RADICATOR with the early pace along the inside, narrowly
showed the way into the turn, gave way turning for home. SMARTY GRIMES tired while saving ground.

Footnotes
TRUE CASTLE broke alertly, pressed the issue early off the inside, vied between horses late in the turn, shook off the other speed to be clear when
straightened for home, just enough left to hold the runner up safe in the waning strides. SHE'S A DIME settled off the early pace, steered to the outside
turning for home, rallied out in the strip to finish fast and narrowly miss. SWEET CARLI pressed the issue off the inside, challenged three wide late in the
turn, could not match the top pair in the drive, saved the show. FIELD DAISEY went evenly while three out to four wide in the turn. LOVE MY HONEY off a
step slow, was used to move up and take over the opening furlong, vied through the turn closest to the inside, gave way steadily in the drive. SHE BE
ADDIE off a step slow, raced back and failed to menace. FLEETA BELLE was finished early. STORM TRAFFIC was also always outrun.

Footnotes
QUANA DUDE settled off the pace just off the inside, rallied three wide out of the final turn, quickly gained command and drew clear, kept to task. PROUD
NATION settled off the pace while racing toward the inside, two path into the lane, proved no match for the winner, enough left late to last for the place.
WICKED CITI void of speed, three wide out of the final turn, set down for the drive, finished willingly to be getting to the runner up. AGITATOR void of
speed, continued unhurried while saving some ground through the second turn, moved out for the drive, called on for some run when straightened for home,
finished willingly to rapidly improve his position. BIG BIZ chased the leader from along the inside then gave way turning for home. SIETE LEGUAS away in
good order, cleared in the first turn just off the inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the second turn, gave way
when headed by the winner into the stretch. GRAND ATLANTIC void of early foot, was never dangerous while racing just off the inside. JASIRI settled off
the early pace, weakened after five furlongs. NO PROBLEMO raced in the middle of the pack for six furlongs then tired. GROVER CAPOTE four wide into
the first turn, remained always back, distanced after losing contact with the field into the lane, jogged in. KASILOF within striking distance for almost six
furlongs, gave way in the far turn, pulled up, vanned off. TRANQUILITY BASE bobbled into the first turn and unseated rider.

Footnotes
EDGEMONT ROAD washy, broke on top, soon got clear, firmly in hand early, continued to rate in the turn, not threatened in the drive while being kept to
task. DERBY DATE behind the pace, asked along and steered out three wide late in the turn, set down when straightened for home, finished in time for the
place while outside. BANK in the second flight inside, squeezed through along the rail late in the turn, not enough late for the place. MAJOR ATTRACTION
closest to the leader off the inside, had little left in the late going. LEMON AND DIEM lacked early foot off the inside after breaking to the outside, dropped to
the rail early in the turn, saved ground into the stretch, lacked a closing response. MAJESTIC DISPLAY broke back, failed to menace. TIME IS NOW broke
out, in mid pack while off the inside, three wide through the turn, tired. SCORE BOARD last to leave, remained always back.

Footnotes
AWE EMMA within striking distance early along the inside under a snug hold, moved out three wide when moving closer turning for home, lost some ground
to the leader, roused, closed resolutely to get to that one in the final strides. MOTION EMOTION stalked the pace, continued to prompt the leader the middle
half, took over midway on the final turn, shook clear into the lane but could not contain the winner, clearly second best. BEACH FLOWER lacked early foot,
raced four wide through the final turn under encouragement, roused for the drive, could do little with the top pair while widest through the stretch, clear of the
others. ENGLISH SOUL went one paced throughout while racing off the inside. BLUE MOONRISE vied early into the first turn closest to the rail, got clear
before a quarter, showed the way by daylight up the backstretch, offered little resistance to the runner up when that one challenged a quarter mile out,
continued to fade while sulking through the lane. BLESSED AGAIN last to leave, raced back early, dropped inside to save ground through the final turn,
failed to respond in the drive. FUGITIVE LADY finished early, trailed home in showing little.

Footnotes
SHASHASHAKEMEUP outrun in the early going outside, raced four wide through the turn, set down on the outside, fired and finished full of run to be clearly
best. MARVIN off the pace while racing outside, four down to three wide move in the turn to challenge, took over into the lane, clear, no match for the winner
late, well clear of the rest. AMERICAN BUTTERFLY forwardly placed while racing toward the inside, in some traffic behind the leaders late in the turn,
steered out three wide after losing the jump on the runner up, finished up best of the rest. RAGER void of early foot, saved ground much of turn, steered out
widest for the drive, flashed some belated interest midtrack to improve position. GINOBILI broke back, was asked early and often, had little for the drive to
improve only slighlty. THE GREAT DANSKY in mid pack early, fell back in the turn, improved a bit late without posing a serious threat. NUCKY last away,
lacked speed, made little impact while racing inside. TUMBLING SKY closest to the early leader, began a steady fade before a half. ZYRAMID broke sharp,
fell back soon after, moved closer in the three path in the turn then faded through the lane. SYCAMORE RUN sprinted clear soon after the start, set the
pace for a half then stopped when headed by the runner up into the stretch.
