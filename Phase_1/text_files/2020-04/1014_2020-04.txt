Footnotes
EGOMANIAC in mid pack for six furlongs, in tight between horses when beginning to advance midway on the second turn, slipped through along the rail into
the stretch, challenged inside the furlong grounds, swerved late, dug in, game. BLANCO BRONCO five wide into the first turn when off the pace, began to
move into the far turn, four wide through the bend, challenged outside the tiring leader with less than a furlong remaining, late duel, outkicked. MOON IN
THE SKY void of speed, was fanned seven wide out of the final turn, finished willingly to earn the show, no threat to the top two. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY settled
off the pace and the inside, angled out to be five to six wide exiting the final turn, finished up evenly to miss the show. RANDOM AFFAIR broke alert, soon
got clear, rated in the run up the backstretch, inside, continued to hold a daylight advantage past the furlong marker, faltered late. BRAVURA CREEK lacked
early foot, asked along three wide in the second turn, dropped to the inside late in that final bend, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick.
TRAFFIC SCOUT void of speed, swung out turning for home, closed with some belated energy to improve position. ROCKTHEPULPIT closest to the leader
through the first turn, continued to chase up the backstretch and far turn, had little left for the drive. GOTTA LOVE IKE within striking distance in the three
path, faded in the drive. HEROS R COWBOYS five wide into the first turn, remained always back. JEHU forwardly placed for a half, saved ground into the
far turn, gave way. AM TRAM rank in the first turn, was finished early.

Footnotes
DEFENDER took command soon after the start, set all the pace, roused turning for home, drew out through the short stretch under continued steady
handling. WAR VETERAN steered out a bit into the two path into the first turn, main body in the run up the backstretch, asked along far turn, moved to the
inside with less than a quarter mile remaining, closed with good resolve up the inside to earn the place, no threat to the winner. COWORKER settled off the
pace, in the two path through the final turn when improving, closest to the winner late, caught in the final strides for the second spot. HONORING MAJOR
last away, void of early foot, angled out to be five wide turning for home, improved down the middle part of the strip while too late for the place. VIOLENT
STORM void of speed, was making a moderate advance along the inside when bothered slightly by a stricken rival, continued to improve while saving
ground into the stretch, flattened out a bit late after moving off the inside. DON'T FORGET five wide into the first turn, four wide onto the backstretch,
continued outside and was four wide through the second turn, continued one paced to the wire. DARREN'S FORTUNE seven wide into the first turn, lacked
speed, four wide into the far turn, angled in, lacked a rally in the drive. HEALING three wide when off the pace, continued back while off the inside, nothing
for the drive. TOWN DRUNK five wide into the first turn, finished after a half. CHARLIE'S SCHILLER six wide and between foes into the first bend, mid pack
off rail, steadied to avoid a stricken rival three furlongs out, fell back and then continued to fade through the stretch. MUSKOKA WONDER prompted the
pace off the inside, fell far turn, unseated rider.

Footnotes
ROAD GAME broke on top, set a quick set of early fractions along the inside and under restraint, extended advantage upper stretch, enough left to last. MR.
UNUSUAL broke out then came in soon after to bother THEO and causing that foe to clip heels, settled off the pace, two path into lane, roused, finished up
willingly to be getting to the winner late. MAJESTIC DAY void of early foot, angled out to be three wide turning for home, also finished well to be carving into
the winner's margin the late going. WAVERUNNER settled in mid pack, saved ground through the second turn while within striking distance, went evenly in
the drive in lacking a late punch. GLOBUS forwardly placed toward the inside, had little for the drive. DESCENT three wide and forwardly placed through the
first turn, chased the winner in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, faltered in the drive. SHAKE IT broke back, continued to lack any early foot,
picked off some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. HIGHLIGHT REEL was never a factor while racing three wide. AWESOME EKATI behind the
pace while racing off the inside, was three out to four wide late in the final turn, came up empty for the drive. BE AN INSPIRATION remained always back
while off the inside. THEO was off a step slow then clipped heels and briefly lost irons when MR. UNUSUAL came in soon after the start, regained irons,
remained well back. KUMSEE MYTRICK within striking distance early outside, began a steady fade before a half. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
REGARDING THE START, MR. UNUSUAL WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED ELEVENTH.

Footnotes
TAPITOR lacked early foot, began to move in the two path far turn, steered out widest entering the stretch, drifted in, late bid, brushed, up in time. ELITCH
also back early, advanced on the lead pack three late in the final turn, took over, brushed late, outfinished. WHOLE LOTTA LUCK off a step slow, trailed for
a half, saved some ground into the far turn, two path into the lane, finished willingly to be well clear of the others. FALLSTAR broke alertly, with the pace
between foes, held a narrow advantage into the second turn, continued to vie into the stretch, weakened the final furlong. GOLD BACKED well back after
the start, two path final turn, came three wide into the stretch, improved position without posing a serious threat. MUCHO MACHO DAN contested the pace
while four wide through the first turn, three wide when still with the pace in the second turn then faltered in the drive. MAHALO JOHN vied up front along the
inside, weakened. SENOR BLANCO in mid pack early, saved ground, had little for the drive while remaining inside. EXCAVATION was never a factor.
RICKHOUSE four wide through the first turn, steadily retreated. D'URBAN PARK vied up front while three wide and between rivals, gave way into the far
turn, continued to fade to finish far back. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN IN DEEP STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY
THE RIDER OF ELITCH AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE WANING STRIDES, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO
STAND.

Footnotes
SEKANI away in good order from the outside, stalked the pace in the three path into turn, asked along late in the bend, put a head in front when
straightened for home, drove clear under firm handling. THE MARY ROSE forwardly placed inside, also was called on for run late in the turn, briefly boxed
entering the stretch, shifted out, finished willingly to earn the place. CHOCTAW CHARLIE pressed the leader in the two path, vied into the lane, lacked a
winning response. PROUD VICTORIA in the second flight while three wide, set down on the outside into the drive, mild late interest to be along for the
show, no real threat. LUCKY EVERY DAY broke alertly, set the pace inside under restraint, gave way when headed. GET ONE MORE lacked speed
outside, four wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive. HISSY MISSY broke in the air to spot the field a couple of lengths, trailed most of the way.
JULIE ARKANSAS saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
SLEW TANG CLAN void of speed, swung out to be five wide turning into the stretch, roused, closed with good resolve to be up in time. SMART CALL off a
step slow, raced well back, three wide through the final turn, steered out entering the stretch, set down, rallied, drifted in, continued willingly to the finish to
be clear for the place. DREAMONMEBABY three wide through the first turn, fanned five wide into the lane when advancing, flattened out a bit late to lose
the place. MEGA MAX vied up front off the inside, fell back off the two leaders the middle half, saved ground into the lane when moving slightly closer,
continued evenly while off the inside. HIGH TONE vied up front closest to the inside, shook clear the middle half, continued to show the way into the stretch,
faltered when confronted in the final furlong. FRONT MAN settled off the pace toward the inside, crept closest while in the two path late in the final turn,
failed to sustain that advance in the drive. BRUSH DOG lacked speed, was never dangerous toward rail. TRINITY THUNDAH settled in mid pack, failed to
muster a rally when called on for the drive. FIRST CITIZEN vied early while three wide through the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch and into
the far turn, gave way when the real running began turning for home. SHACKS WAY four wide into the first turn, 3-4w 2nd turn, tired in the drive. CASCADE
KING off slow, was never a factor. MONEY COMETH in the second flight early, backed up.

Footnotes
SUMMER REVOLUTION outrun early along the inside, crept closer turn, waited along the rail late in the bend, got through entering the stretch, set down,
drove clear. JUNIOR GILLIAM lacked speed while racing outside, three out to five wide through the turn, finished willingly be clear for the place. CADRON
FLATS with the pace off the inside, vied between horses through the turn, narrow advantage into the lane, could no match the top two late, saved the show.
FLASH ATTACK broke back, lacked speed, angled four wide into the stretch, made a belated run to miss the show outside. ACADEMY BAY in the main
body, in some traffic late in the turn, continued to be surrounded by rivals past the furlong marker, some mild late interest. PLATINUM NIGHTS a pace factor
while in the three path and widest of the first flight, weakened. KAPELLMEISTER off the pace and the inside, steadied when in tight entering the turn, in
traffic then moved out four wide turning for home, came up empty when clear for the drive. R FAST LIFE void of speed, saved ground to no avail. DAHIK
four wide through the turn when off the pace, had little left for the drive. MYSTIC TIGER broke back, was always outrun. HONDURAS away in good order,
with the pace along the inside for a half, gave way in the drive. SACRED KIKI BIRD bobbled at the start, raced in the second flight early three wide, gave
way in the drive.

CURATE forwardly placed and along the inside, continued behind the first flight into the turn, swung out for the drive, challenged past the furlong marker,
edged clear under firm handling. EARLY MISCHIEF broke alertly, narrowly showed the way off the rail up the backstretch, dropped inside for the turn, vied
past the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner late, proved stubborn for the place. HOME RUN MAKER pressed the issue from the
outside, between the top two past the furlong marker outkicked late for the place. MOJOVATION went one paced off the inside, in lacking a closing punch.
OPERATION STEVIE off a step sloe, raced back, came 4-5w into the lane, improved position while too late to make an impression on the top four.
PUTTHEGLASSDOWN off a step slow, raced back early, improved slightly by saving ground into the stretch, roused, finished up flatly late. TOUCHING
RAINBOWS in mid pack while off the inside, four wide exiting the turn, lacked a closing kick. ZIPP ON BY vied up front while between horses, gave way in
the drive. EZMOSH remained always back. COLONEL KLINK finished early, far back, distanced after losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
MAN IN THE CAN outrun in the early going, advanced three wide in the turn, lost some ground to the frontrunners into the lane, roused, kicked down the
leader late to be in time. CAPTAIN DON forwardly placed while out in the strip, three wide through the turn, collared the leader inside the furlong marker, led
late, could not contain the winner. TEMPT FATE back off the pace after breaking to the outside, saved ground through the turn, moved out, some late
interest to be up for the show late. ZAINO BOYZ away well, dueled early off the inside, shook well clear in the turn, saw that lead diminish when
straightened for home, faltered late when headed. CHICKEN HAWK off a step slow, raced back, improved position slightly while off the inside, no real
threat. HAMAZING WISDOM off slow, trailed for much of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. TEN BUDS off the pace outside,
tired while four wide out of the turn. PIECE OF WORK broke alertly, dueled briefly closest to the inside but off the rail, stopped in the drive.

PRINCE PIERCE with the pace from the start along the inside, attained some distanced from the other speed when straightened for home, held sway late
under steady handling. SCRUTINIZER broke alertly, with the pace outside the winner, fell back off that one entering the stretch, could not get back to that
same rival while drifting out a bit inside the furlong marker. RULER OF THE NILE in the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground through the
turn, lacked a winning response in the drive. ALWAYS last to leave, trailed for a half well back, saved ground through the lane, improved up the rail.

CODETOWIN raced back toward the inside, improved into the lane, flattened out. IRRITATOR in mid pack outside, steered out to be four wide into the lane,
failed to muster a rally. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER was always outrun. FAREEQ pressed three wide, faded. CONQUEROR was always outrun while four out
