MR MISLEADING pressed the pace from the inside and prevailed under all out pressure. DRAMACIDE showed good early speed, raced two deep and
finished gamely to the wire. NOVEMBER MIKE stalked the pace, raced three wide through the lane and finished willingly to the wire. BUG ZAPPER stalked
the pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no final winning bid. FROGGY settled off the early pace, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and
never was a factor. WHAT THINKING was slow early, saved ground and never threatened. KIMS ADONIS dropped back early and failed to have a
response. INDY STRIPES stalked the pace, tired readily and was eased up on in the stretch.
