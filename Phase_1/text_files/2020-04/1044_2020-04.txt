Footnotes
JIMMIE T settled off the pace and the inside, advanced three out to four wide in the second turn, took over, shook clear in upper stretch, slight drift, enough
left to last. IMPLICATOR steadied into the first turn when off the pace, saved ground the middle half, blocked late in the final turn when moving closer,
shifted out for the drive, set down, finished willingly while too late. INTO ORBIT void of early foot, moved out, four wide advance in the second turn, closest
to the winner a furlong out, proved no match for the runner up late. BLANCO BRONCO head turned at the start to be off slowly, raced back, two path
through most of the final turn, improved position. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY raced off the pace, three wide in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, some
traffic in the second turn, continued one paced in the drive. MR. COUGAR four wide into the first turn, continued outside and was five wide into the far bend,
made little impact through the stretch in picking up a couple of tiring rivals. HAMAZING SONG broke alertly, sprinted out to a long early lead, continued to
show the way up the backstretch, offered some resistance when challenged in the second turn, gave way when headed. I STAN FOR LOVE forwardly
placed for five furlongs, gave way in the final turn. CHICKEN HAWK chased, backed up. PEARLTHIRTYEIGHT was never involved. PAY DIRT was finished
after a half. EVEN HIGHER off slowly, trailed far back, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in.

outfinished. COOL CATOMINE broke in good order, set or forced the pace closest to the inside, continued to vied into the stretch, could not match the top
two late, lasted for the show. OMEN OF CHANGE lacked speed while off the inside, advanced in the two path and through some traffic, steered three wide
into the lane, gaining for the show spot late. HYNDFORD vied early while between foes, stalked in the second flight the middle half, saved some ground
through the second turn inside of traffic, came up empty for the drive. SWITHERAL void of early foot, four wide through the second turn, lacked a closing
kick in the drive. CARMELO settled off the pace toward the inside, steadied slightly in traffic into the far turn, also failed to respond in the drive. ESPOSITO
within striking distance off the inside, three wide second turn then gave way in the drive. SHAKEDOWN was always outrun. MOSTLY SUNNY five wide into

Footnotes
CONNECTION pushed in at the start, raced off the pace early toward the inside, angled out to be four wide exiting the turn, set down, kicked down the
leader. NORTH SIDE broke alertly, set the pace, shook well clear into the stretch, proved no match for the winner late, clearly second best. SPECIAL
PRYCE void of early foot, continued back while four wide through the turn, rallied to be clear for the show, no threat to the top pair. DA GOLD ROOM in mid
pack while racing outside, also was four wide around the bend, roused for the drive, finished up evenly. FLEXATI broke back, raced in the two path through
the turn, picked off some tiring rivals while not a serious threat. ALLEN'S ROCKET in the main body outside, three out to four wide late in the turn, finished
up evenly in lacking a serious kick. KNOCKOUT BERT forwardly placed, chased the runner up in the three path into and through the turn, gave way in the
drive. I LIVED IT forced in and bothered to be off slowly, trailed early, steered out steadily to be five wide into the lane, improved slightly while not a real
threat. FEARLESS ROCKET broke in to bother a couple of inner rivals, was quickly straightened to race closest to the leader just off the inside, gave way in
the drive. UNCLE TAP was always outrun while four out to five wide in the turn. MAYBE A SPIDER staged a steady retreat. MY VOW IS COURAGE was
finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
TOWN CHAMP came out early to bother outer rivals, was straightened to duel while well out in the strip, remained in the four path while contesting the issue
into the turn, three wide into the lane, drove well clear under steady handling. PAT DADDY in the second flight while racing outside, three wide through the
turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, edging clear for the place. SILVER RIDE in the second group inside, advanced to lodge a bid along the rail
late in the turn, closest to the winner a furlong out, no match for that one,outkicked for the place. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER bothered after the start when the
winner came out, raced back, four wide exiting the turn, improved upper stretch with some mild interest. FLAT LUCKY pinched back at the start, raced back,
five wide into the lane, improved slightly. JERRYS PRIDENJOY mid pack while racing outside, four wide turn, failed to muster a rally when called on for the
drive. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL was never dangerous while saving ground to no avail. STORMIN HONGKONG remained back in the two path in failing to
menace. YOUVESAIDITALL lacked early foot, never a threat. DROP OF GOLDEN SUN forwardly placed in the early going, steadily faded in the two path.
BIG BELLA BROWN dueled up front in the three path backstretch and early turn, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
WILBO off the pace while well wide early, five wide through the turn when moving closer, put a head in front to take over just inside the furlong marker,
found more late to hold the runner up safe. AWESOME SATURDAY back off the pace and the inside, two path through most of the turn, angled out in some
traffic to be four wide into the stretch, challenged between rivals and inside the winner late, denied. FIRECROW broke sharply, alternated up front off the
inside, continued to hold a slim advantage past the furlong marker, could not match the top two late, held the show. ST. JOE BAY settled off the pace just
off the rail, moved closer in the two path turn, flattened out in the drive. NERO in the second flight while racing in the three path, weakened. GRAY
ATTEMPT within striking distance along the inside, had little left for the drive. ALMITHMAAR remained back, never a threat. LENSTAR forwardly placed
while four wide through the turn, tired in the drive. DRENA'S STAR away in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside for a half and gave way.
TRINGALE off a step slow, was always outrun.

JUNGLE WARFARE unhurried early outside, rallied five down to four wide out of the final turn, collared the leaders past the furlong marker and was edging
away late under pressure. PICKFORD five wide into the first turn, angled in to save some ground, stalked the pace three wide the middle half, advanced
and challenged inside the winner nearing midstretch, could not match strides late with that rival, held sway for the place. SECRET TOUCH pressured the
leader off the inside, advanced on that one into the stretch, challenged between rivals and inside the runner up, finished up best of the rest. COACH
ADAMS broke on top, set the pace inside, continued to show the way into the stretch then caved when pressured in the run to the wire. LIGHT OF THE
WORLD turned in an even effort while racing off the inside. TAPSOLUTE void of speed inside, angled out steadily to be four wide late in the final turn when
improving slightly, flattened out the final furlong. ONE LAST STRIKE void of speed, remained back while saving ground in the second turn, passed mostly
tiring rivals to improve position. DETERMINANT last away, raced three wide, also picked off some faltering rivals while not a threat. KNIGHT'S CROSS
remained back while racing mostly three wide. CANDY STORE was also finished after a half. FEDERAL CASE forwardly placed while along the inside, had
nothing left for the drive in backing up. MISSISSIPPI settled in mid pack toward the rail, stopped through the stretch.

SNEAKING OUT away in good order, with the pace inside, continued to duel turn, headed by two rivals past the furlong marker, dug in gamely along the rail
to gain the nod at the wire. BYE BYE J never far back while racing outside, ranged up to challenge three wide turning for home, vied past the furlong marker
while widest of the first flight, narrowly missed. READY TO RUNAWAY broke sharp, set or forced the pace, between rivals through the lane, weakened in
the late going while remaining between the top two. A. P. PRINCESS void of speed, raced three wide through the turn, improved position in some mild late
interest, no threat to the top three. NOMIZAR in the second flight outside, four wide into the lane, managed little in the way of any late punch. FLAT OUT
SPEED off the pace, in the two path out of the turn, chased the first flight past the furlong then had little left in tiring late. BEAUTIFUL TALE went evenly
while racing outside. LADY OF LUXURY within striking distance behind the first flight early, had little left for the drive. POTRA LIZA broke back, void of any
early foot, swung out four wide for the drive, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve down the middle of the strip. MY SISTER MADI in mid
pack for a half off the inside, tired in the drive. ON DECK finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
LONG WEEKEND broke sharp, crossed to the inside past the five furlong marker, continued to narrowly show the way into and through the turn, extended
stretch duel while remaining inside, refused to give in, game. ECHO TOWN away in good order, pressed the issue from between rivals, began to be
aggressively ridden late in the turn, hooked up with the winner for a protracted stretch duel outside that one exiting the turn, remained on even terms to the
wire, not enough in the waning strides. LYKAN last to leave, trailed while racing off the inside, came three wide into the lane, stage a mild rally to annex the
show, no threat to the winner. LITTLE MENACE tracked the first flight from along the inside, had little in the way of a response for the drive. EIGHT RINGS
broke slightly inward, recovered to force the issue in the three path, asked along into the lane, failed to respond, gradually weakened. SIR RICK lacked
speed while off the inside, chased the leaders into the lane and had nothing left for the drive.

MIA MISCHIEF away well from the outside prompted the leader in the two path into the turn, engaged that one late in the bend, powered clear under firm
handling. AMY'S CHALLENGE broke sharp, worked way to the inside in setting the pace firmly in hand, responded then raced on equal terms with the
winner briefly into the lane then proved no match. LADY SUEBEE settled off the pace and the inside, checked up in tight quarters early in the turn, fell back,
came three wide into the lane, along late for the show while not a threat to the top two. BELLAFINA off a step slow, raced back early as a result, moved out,
advanced with a four wide move into contention through the turn, flattened out in the drive, caught late for the show. SUNNY DALE forwardly placed early
along the inside, shuffled back early turn, had little for the drive to finish up evenly. CLASSY ACT lacked early foot, advanced in the turn, roused late in the
bend, lacked a further response. MIDNIGHT FANTASY void of early foot, moved out widest late in the turn, lacked a closing kick. WHAT A FOX broke out a
bit, raced off the pace and the inside, backed up in the drive to be well beaten.

Footnotes
VIOLENT PASS broke alertly, showed the way through the first turn, dueled backstretch, fell back off leader, went back after that foe second turn, regained
the advantage, drove clear then held the runner up safe late. COPPER KING main body, raced in traffic in the two path into the far turn, came three wide
into the lane, came in slightly to help tighten up ON D'ORO nearing midstretch, was straightened out and closed with good energy to be getting to the
winner late. RONAMO five wide in the first turn when off the pace, advanced, took over, well clear in the far turn, could not last. UNRIGHTEOUS in some
traffic under firm restraint in the first turn, settled in the two path in the run up the backstretch, pushed out by COPPER KING early in the final turn, steered
out wider to be in the five path turning for home, some gain. BELFAST BOY forwardly placed in the two path early, fell back, saved ground second turn,
came out to tighten up ON D'ORO nearing midstretch then finished up evenly. ALL ABOUT WILL void of speed, continued well back for six furlongs, swung
out seven wide to be widest for the drive, improved position. ON D'ORO four wide in the first turn, evenly paced, was continuing in even fashion when put in
tight, checked up midstretch, nothing left. AZTEC EMPIRE lacked speed off the inside, continued in the two path, failed to menace. TIZ THE JOURNEY
three wide in the first turn, continued back, six wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally. LOOKIN HIGH void of speed off the inside, also lacked a closing
response. MAJESTIC DISPLAY forwardly placed and three wide, gave way after a half. A. K. SAFARI four wide both turns, backed up in the drive.
