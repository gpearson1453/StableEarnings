Footnotes
PROMNESIA dueled from the inside with VIDALIA, inched away around around the turn, traveled clear into the stretch, urged a few times right-handed and
stayed clear to the wire. VIDALIA dueled from the outside, lost contact with the winner and came three to four wide into the stretch and proved second best.
TRUE TO THE TRUTH tracked off the rail, went outside a rival, two to three wide around the turn and outkicked rival for the show. LAST DANCE BELLA
stalked the pacesetters from the inside, a bit off the rail into the lane and outfinished for third. HAPPIER TOGETHER forwardly placed outside of the top
pair, traveled three deep then chased four wide into the lane and weakened. CHITTER CHATTER outside a rival early, entered the turn four wide, came out
approaching the eighth pole and lacked a rally. KATHIA raced wide up the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the turn, saved ground to the lane and
never threatened. PLAYA CHICA off the rail early, angled in and trailed along the inside nearing the turn, steadied off the heels of KATHIA near the quarter
pole and came up empty in the final furlong.
