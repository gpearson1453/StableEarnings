Footnotes
HYDROSTATIC up close alongside the leader in the early going, challenged from the inside on the turn and took a short lead, kicked clear in upper stretch
and drew away under a drive. IRISH JACK reserved up the backstretch, took the turn two wide, came under urging in upper stretch and got up for the place.
CAPTAIN N. BARRON stalked just off the leader, bid three wide around the turn then came four wide into the stretch and needed more in deep stretch while
gaining third. BOUNTY HUNTER set the pace with HYDROSTATIC to the inside, challenged for command through the turn and fought back three wide into
the stretch but weakened in the final sixteenth. DUTT BART settled along the inside, saved ground to the lane and never produced a bid. EL SENOR DE
LATUNA stalked outside the leader then off the rail, went three wide around the turn and weakened. SURE PROOF tracked the pace while outside of EL
SENOR DE LATUNA, traveled five wide through the bend and also weakened.

Footnotes
REAL QUICK sent for the lead and gained command, set the pace inside, pressured around the turn and into the stretch, then inched away under
right-handed urging. PAPA CABALLERO bumped away from the gate, stalked the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, rallied along the
fence in the final furlong and edged NOVA for the place. NOVA broke in and bumped rival at the start, showed early speed then pressed the leader from the
outside, continued to challenge three wide leaving the turn and upper stretch but got outfinished in the late stages and edged for second. CASH
ENCOUNTER stumbled leaving the gate, went four wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and weakened. YODELERS WAY broke through the
gate prior to the start, forwardly placed to the outside of the top pair, entered the turn three wide, kept in that same path to the stretch and failed to find the
needed response. IRISH SKY bumped both sides at the start, outside a rival in the early going, went two wide into the turn, angled in around the bend and
came up empty when asked.

Footnotes
RINSE AND REPEAT allowed to settle early, raced two wide on the turn, looked to advance but lacked room from the three-sixteenths marker to the eighth
pole, shifted outside a rival, flew late and inhaled the leader to nail that foe on the line. HARDCORE TROUBADOR set the pace off the rail, padded the lead
while traveling in the two path on the turn, stayed clear through the drive but weakened in the final sixteenth and got nailed at the wired. PORTANDO
tracked the pace from the inside, saved ground to the stretch and finished well. RUN FACTOR bumped at the start, stalked the leader up the backstretch,
raced two wide then angled four to five wide and lugged out through the final sixteenth. MORNING BLURS settled early, went two to three wide around the
turn and finished willingly in the drive. BUSTER DOUGLAS (BRZ) raced off the rail, went four wide around the turn and never rallied. WALK ON WATER
lacked early speed, angled in steadily on the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was always outrun. OLDER BROTHER bumped at the start,
raced three wide into the turn, angled four to five wide and weakened.

Footnotes
QUITE A STARLETT raced along the inside, swung out and came five wide into the lane, lugged in through the stretch and rallied overtake rivals in the the
final strides. BAYONCE bumped at the start, set the pace outside of INDIAS LUTE, carried out by that rivals around the turn and pushed out steadily
through the drive, continued to fight gamely in deep stretch but got outkicked by the winner. INDIAS LUTE broke out and bumped rival, attended the pace
from inside the leader, collared rival on the turn then lugged out around the bend, drifted out through the stretch and was outfinished in the deep stretch.
JEMSEK stalked off the rail, moved in some around the turn, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch and went evenly late. BRITE TAN stalked outside a rival,
two to three wide around the turn and never summoned a bid. A WILL AND A WAY broke out, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground along the
inside and showed little.
