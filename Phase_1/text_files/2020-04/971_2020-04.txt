Footnotes
DUELLIST rated three to four wide off the early pace, prompted five wide near the quarter pole then raced wide under a drive entering the lane, responded
sharply along the far outside and cleared late. DRAMATIC KITTEN was well placed sitting just off the three way duel, waited near the inside at the quarter
pole, launched a game rail in stretch run, briefly held the lead then got outkicked when the winner rallied by late. PUNCHLINE was a bit keen and rated in
range under a snug hold, waited near the quarter pole then tipped out for a clear path upper stretch, advanced to race in aim for the lead at the sixteenth
pole then lacked the needed surge for the win. TOOK A CAB broke out at the start then vied inside around the first turn, dueled inside a duo down the
backstretch and around the far turn, battled on gamely to hold the lead at the eighth pole then came up tired in final stages. PERFECT ENOUGH raced in
the second flight to the far turn, launched a bid and raced four to five wide through the lane but lacked the needed response for serious impact.
ARMANDO'S TEAM raced in the last flight, circled up closer on the final turn then flattened out upper stretch. BARBIE'S KING raced off the pace, put to a
drive three to four wide in stretch run, raced in traffic near mid-stretch and brushed with tiring BLESSED JOURNEY near the sixteenth pole. BLESSED
JOURNEY vied for the lead around the first turn, continued to battle between foes on the far turn, chased on into the lane then came up empty in late
stages. BIG TREASURE settled through early stages, roused to launch a three wide bid at three eighths pole but lacked the needed response to threaten.
HIGHWAY FLYER vied for the lead around the first turn and continued to battle past the quarter pole then tired. BOOGADI STEEL raced off the pace, saved
ground down the backstretch and had no response when called upon. STORMY SPLASH raced four to five wide in the back and had no response.

Footnotes
PEPPI THE HUNTER was well placed and settled nicely while tracking the top two early leaders, prompted to make a run for the leader nearing the quarter
pole, came out wider under left handed pressure top stretch then took command from SO LONG CHUCK and pulled away. DEXTER ROAD rated three to
four wide through early stages, hustled up around the turn then ridden along five wide entering the lane, switched in a couple paths under steady pressure
and stayed on with response to gain second best. SO LONG CHUCK broke through the gate but did not get away, was forwardly placed on the early leader,
moved up to engage rival near the half mile marker then cleared on top leaving the backstretch, held firm around the turn then got collared by the winner
upper stretch and flattened to show. MILLIONAIRE RUNNER raced in the last flight, roused three wide entering the lane then tipped out a couple paths
wider and showed interest without threatening. TWO STEP SLEW raced off the pace and saved ground, launched a two wide bid on the turn and into the
lane but lacked the needed response for impact. HE'S SMOKIN HOT raced in the last flight then four wide entering the lane and posed no threat.
GEMOLOGISTER bumped the gate at the start then quickly advanced to the lead, lost the lead leaving the backstretch and retreated.

pole, cut the corner then took command and held firm under a driving finish. I'M A GINGER bumped into the backend of TOONIE LOONIE then brushed into
outside rival, was allowed to settle in the opening quarter then ranged up five wide on the turn, continued a steady outside bid through the lane and finished
second best. TOONIE LOONIE backend took a solid bump at the start then roused forward to race in aim, vied for the lead around the turn then got collared
by the winner entering the lane but fought on to hold a share. SNAKE N SHAKE raced near then back then very wide in the lane and showed interest in final
stages. BELLA GIANNA hustled along from the get-go and raced in range through the turn, shifted out wider in upper stretch, ran on but lacked the needed
response for impact. PRINCESS AVRIL chased in range through early stages, moved up to race in aim for the lead at the quarter pole then gave way in the
final furlong. AZNAVOUR hustled along under steady pressure, saved ground on the turn then angled out and failed to move on. LEISHLANICK chased

Footnotes
WAR ACT settled briefly off the early pace then launched a bid, cut into the leaders margin around the turn, took command from UNO BABY BIRD upper
stretch then drew off under steady pressure. MIGHTY FAST hustled up along the inside around the turn then shifted out wide for the drive, was no match for
clear winner but finished with response to gain second best. W W ARCHIE hustled up from the get-go and was the closest pursuer on the leader through
early stages, moved out wider for the drive and stayed on for a share. UNO BABY BIRD sped to the lead and widened to a clear advantage still racing in
hand, rivals began to loom closer late on the turn, got collared by the winner upper stretch then steadily weakened. KATZ ME AT NOON steadied and
dropped back at the start, trailed racing wide, stayed wide into the lane and gained position without threatening. MAQUIAVELO raced two to three wide off
the early pace then took the inside position in stretch run and failed to move into contention. MAJOR SWARTZY broke in at the start, raced near the back
and never reached contention. NOTHING FOR FREE showed early response then dropped back. RESTLESS ROCKER saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
ALPILLES was sent to the lead and held firm around the turn, roused for more at the head of the lane, had kick left in reserve and held clear under a driving
finish. BROADWAY PEGGY was yet unleashed while saving ground on the turn, launched a bid entering top stretch, gained racing two wide at the furlong
marker then tipped out wider and edged closer on the winner. LITTLE BELLA raced near the rear and saved ground, angled out top of the lane, responded
under right handed pressure and finished well. ONEZY'S DREAM raced off the top two leaders around the turn, chased on into the lane then lacked a
strong closing kick for serious impact. GREY MANNERS was forwardly placed and raced two wide in aim for the lead at the quarter pole then gave way in
the final sixteenth. MOON EYES raced off the early pace then shifted wide in the lane and lacked a needed rally. ZIP IT JESS raced in range through early
stages then flattened out around the turn and offered no late bid. ABARRIO FOREVER raced in the back then wide into the lane and failed to move into
contention. ANGELIC KNUGGET raced near mid-range early on then flattened around the turn. DOMINEER was positioned as a sharp factor positioned
along the rail in early stages then gave way.

advantage entering the lane then kept clear under steady encouragement. MYSTICAL MOON rated off the pace duel, ranged up to threaten late on the far
turn then remained in steady pursuit two to three wide through the lane. DARK AGES raced three to four wide off the early pace, loomed a threat while five
wide on the far turn then continued a steady bid in stretch run. SNAP HOOK settled and saved ground through early stages, produced a mild five to six wide
bid in the lane. BLUESKY KITTEN got bumped at the start, was reserved near the back, raced five wide into the lane and passed tiring foes. KING
LEONARDO got bumped off stride at the start, raced off the pace near the inside then raced three wide into the lane without threatening. LOOKIN SAVVY
raced off the pace then seven wide top stretch and failed to factor. IM THE CAPTAIN NOW got brushed a couple times at the start, raced in the back then
widest into the lane and offered no late bid. SLICK STAR dueled quickly on the front end then tired in the drive. CROW MOON dueled quickly on the front
end and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SILVERLY ENOUGH was well placed racing just off the embattled duo early on then began edging up three wide leaving the backstretch, held a slight edge
at the quarter pole with MASERATI MAN looming a danger along the outside, vied for the lead in the final furlong positioned inside of MASERATI MAN, dug
in gamely under strong handling and refused to be denied. MASERATI MAN rated off the leaders in early stages then moved up four wide to race in striking
distance at the quarter pole, got carried out four to five wide into the lane then advanced to duel for the lead with SILVERY ENOUGH, battled back gamely
along the outside but could not get by winner in final strides. UNCAPTURED KING settled in early stages and saved ground, angled out and headed in
pursuit around the turn, was under a drive four wide in upper stretch, continued a steady bid and prevailed for a share. PERUVIAN BOY raced off the early
pace then raced six wide under a drive entering top stretch and lacked a needed rally. INTER MIAMI vied for the early lead with MOBEATABAD, battled
back to the quarter pole then tired in the drive. CIGAR BOX raced two to three wide off the pace and offered no late bid. MOBEATYABAD vied for the early
lead with INTER MIAMI to the quarter pole then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
HALLADAY was off to a good start and angled in from the outside position to be forwardly placed entering the first turn, took over the lead in the opening
quarter and set the pace while saving ground to the far turn, remained clear still unasked on the far turn, prompted for more top of the lane, stayed sharp
under a mild drive and finished going away. KROY led the way in opening stages then conceded position to HALLADAY on the first turn, settled in good
position and stalked the leader down the backstretch, launched a bid for HALLADAY near the quarter pole, continued with solid response in the lane but
was no match for the winner. PENALTY rated off the early pace, prompted near the three eighths pole and gained position three to four wide, shifted out
wider for the drive and continued a steady bid to gain show. CLASS AND CASH tracked the top two leaders while saving ground to the far turn, launched a
bid near the quarter pole, sustained a three to four wide bid in upper stretch then lacked closing response. FIRST PREMIO was unhurried, raced in the back
then hustled along seven wide top of the lane and passed tiring foes. COLONIST raced off the pace near the inside, moved into stretch six wide under a
drive and failed to threaten. DR. SHANE steadied moving into the first turn, rated off the pace, saved ground and had no response when called upon.
THUNDER RIDE rated near mid-range, roused three wide entering the far turn but failed to move on. MAI TY ONE ON raced in tight two wide and steadied
sharply entering the first turn, raced off the pace and lacked response. REGALLY IRISH raced in range down the backstretch the faded on the far turn.

Footnotes
SONNEMAN was reserved and raced two wide in the back, was put to a drive six to seven wide entering the lane, rallied along the far outside and finished
clear. GOLDEN CANDY was forwardly placed and raced three wide near the half, launched a rail bid on the far turn, stayed on gamely up the inside, got
outkicked when the winner rallied by late then got a head up for place. RALSTON pressed the pace through early stages, vied for the lead with ILL FIGHT
DEMPSEY on the turn, battled on and held a slight edge past the furlong marker, continued to put in a good effort then lacked a closing kick. I'LL FIGHT
DEMPSEY set a pressured pace then vied for the lead around the turn, battled on with RALSTON to the furlong marker then flattened out. ACRE settled
early racing five wide, tucked in and hustled up two wide around the turn, shifted out wider in late stages, showed interest but needed more for impact.
MASTERDAY prompted three to four wide in early stages then faded on the turn. TOMCAT BLACK got carried inside by drifting in rival and steadied at the

Footnotes
AVENIDA MANANA sprinted out to the lead in opening stages and set the pace while saving ground down the backstretch, turned back bid from rival and
held clear around the far turn, saved ground entering the lane and held firm under steady pressure. BAHAMA KITTEN rated near midpack then prompted
three wide on the far turn, hustled along five wide into the lane and continued a solid bid under strong handling for second best. TRILBY rated off the early
pace, raced wide under a drive in the lane and got a nose up for show. PAINT THE CORNERS tracked the pace to the far turn, launched a three wide bid
around the far turn, chased on the in lane and got nipped for show. SWEET STORY rated in range under slight restraint, launched a two wide bid entering
the lane and got edged out for a placing. VINYARDNINA settled through early stages then raced five wide into the lane and had a mild improve without
threatening. NIGHT WATCH raced off the pace then wide into stretch and lacked a needed rally. YAKO stalked the pacesetter to the far turn, launched a
two wide bid for rival, could not reach winner then faded in the final furlong. MUCH ABOUT IT rated along the inside, raced in traffic top stretch, angled out
wider and failed to move on. VITAEMI raced in the back then wide into the stretch and failed to move into contention. ISADORABLE AIDA tracked the pace
along the inside, headed in pursuit along the rail in the far turn then faded in the lane. AMAZING AUDREY positioned near the rear then raced very wide into
the lane and lacked response.
