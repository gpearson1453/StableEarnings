Footnotes
MAGICAL MIKE rated along the inside positioned off the pressured top flight, picked up the pace two wide on the far turn then tipped wider for the drive,
responded under strong handling and drew clear late. SWEET GIANT brushed with foe entering the first turn then settled off the pressured top flight, picked
up the pace and roused to a forward position late on the far turn, took over the lead from JACK BEANSTALK near mid-stretch then got outkicked by the
winner. TRAFFIC TROUBLE raced between foes through early stages, circled up closer four to five wide late on the far turn then continued a steady bid
through the lane and gained a share. JACK BEANSTALK set a pressured pace down the backstretch then repelled bids on the far turn, kept on
determinedly top of the lane then got collared by SWEET GIANT and steadied while weakening. SKYLINE VIEW secured inside position on the first turn and
saved ground to the far turn, hustled up around the far turn then raced a bit tight entering top of the lane, shifted out wider and had a mild improve. IMA
COALMAN raced off the pace then fanned wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. MAKINALEGACY was unhurried in the back, showed response
racing two wide then along the inside upper stretch but failed to sustain bid. PUMP ROOM raced off the pace, shifted to the inside and put to pressure upper
stretch but could not muster a rally. KEEP MARCHING prompted the pace down the backstretch, raced three wide in aim at the quarter pole then gave way
leaving the far turn. HONOR THIS pressed the pace to the far turn then gave way. NOBLE NEBRASKAN was forwardly placed along the outside, raced
three wide in aim for the lead entering the far turn then failed to sustain bid past the quarter pole. MISTER NOISI rated along the outside, failed to gain
under pressure around the far turn and steadily faded.

handed pressure upper stretch, continued to drift out a couple paths while CONGRATS THIS began moving up to challenge for the lead, continued with a
slim lead under strong right handed urging then roused left handed in the final sixteenth, drifted out and brushed into CONGRATS THIS impeding foe then
retained a narrow advantage. CONGRATS THIS was allowed to settle through early stages then launched an outside bid around the turn, was moving up
closer on RED FOG while wanting to lug in upper stretch, continued to edge up under a strong left handed drive and maintained course despite wanting to
lug in, got brushed by drifting out RED FOG deep stretch and narrowly missed. SHE LOVE ME rated off the early pace while saving ground, came under a
ride along the inside on the far turn, cut the corner and continued a steady bid up the inside and cleared show. STEADILY raced off the early pace then
hustled up racing two wide at the quarter pole, continued a two wide bid into the lane then gave way. DR G'S HOPE stalked the pacesetter to the far turn,
could not reach rival under pressure then faded in the lane. EL ZEUS tracked the early pace then failed to respond under pressure around the turn and

STILL SCHEMIN was well placed tracking the embattled par down the backstretch, advanced three to the lead late on the far turn then stayed sharp and
clear through the lane. MAYITO rated not too far back early on, roused three to four wide on the far turn then dug in gamely to hold place. CUY got carried
out wide entering the first turn, launched a bid on the far turn, was under a drove four wide entering the lane, stayed on with response and lasted for show.
FARM STRONG was unhurried then raced wide into the lane, moved in a couple paths, continued a steady bid and just missed show. CLIFTON PARK
rated three wide off the early pace, launched a bid and raced five wide entering top stretch then lugged in under left handed urging and flattened out.
SUPER EDGAR raced off the pace then shifted wide near mid-stretch and passed tiring foes. MOUNTAIN TREE was unhurried and saved ground, angled
out three to four wide in stretch run and failed to rally. WE CONNECTED raced in contention then was awkward in stride past the three eighths pole and
gave way. RAPSTOREROCKS vied for the lead along the inside to late on the final turn then tired in the drive. HELL BENT raced in the back and failed to
move into contention. ELITE MISSION drifted out five wide entering the first turn, vied for the lead down the backstretch then got collared past the quarter
pole and tired in the drive. FUEGO raced off the pace then five to six wide into the stretch and offered no late bid.

Footnotes
ONE HOT DRAMA sped to the the lead then challenged by REITERATE mid-way on the turn, turned back bid and kept clear two wide to the inside through
the lane. DANCING DESTROYER was forwardly placed and chased after the leader into the turn, briefly lost position then cut the corner, remained in
steady pursuit then switched out wider deep stretch and finished second best. ROYAL MISTRESS raced in range along the rail then angled out on the turn,
continued a steady five wide bid in the lane and prevailed for a share. REITERATE hustled up and raced in aim for the leas mid-way on the turn, could not
reach the eventual winner but continued with response then flattened out in the final sixteenth. FOXY LADY was not far back early on then made no
headway around the turn and lacked a needed rally in the lane. GO GATOR GIRL GO hustled along in opening stages but lacked early foot then raced wide
into the lane and offered no late bid.

UNPRECEDENTED broke to the lead and led briefly before being challenged by EMBRACE MY UNCLE, dueled inside of rival around the turn then battled
on into the lane, gained a neck advantage over rival in late stages and refused to relinquish control. EMBRACE MY UNCLE raced up close then advanced
to match strides with UNPRECEDENTED past the half mile marker, battled on gamely through the lane but could not get back by winner deep stretch. TWO
BY TWO raced in the last flight, was ridden along around the turn then continued a two to three wide bid and gained show. W W CANDY chased five wide
through early stages then moved into stretch six wide under a drive and needed more. THREE DEEP chased along the inside early on then angled on the
turn and gave way in the lane. WINTER AT BASTOGNE raced off the pace and offered no late bid. FIFTY CENTS steadied in the opening quarter then
chased in in range then failed to keep pace late turn. JACK EL BARBARO showed response and briefly engaged the second flight then weakened mid-turn.

Footnotes
DOMINATE THEMOMENT settled in good position then launched a three wide bid in the far turn, spun out wider entering top stretch then advanced to race
in aim for the lead at the eighth pole then drove by deep stretch. KING OF RANCH stalked behind the pacesetter to the far turn then hustled up two wide
and took control upper stretch, fought back under pressure in late stages and lacked the closing kick to hold off the winner. HANDSOME LIL DEVIL settled
nicely nicely not too far back through early stages, was ridden along three wide around the far turn, got carried five wide entering top stretch and continued a
steady outside to gain show. MONEY RIDE got bumped by drifting out rival at the start, raced in range along the inside, launched a rail bid on the far turn,
remained in contention upper stretch then came out a couple paths and gave way. FLASH PASS drifted out and bumped into rival at the start then sped to
the lead and set the pace down the backstretch, came under pressure late on the far turn then got collared upper stretch and had nothing left in reserve.
HE'S SUPER LUCKY was unhurried then showed response driving two wide between foes near the quarter pole, came out wider entering top stretch,
stayed on briefly then gave way. FRANK FIRST raced in the back and offered no bid.

VOLUBILE rated near midpack along the inside down the backstretch, picked up the pace around the far turn then raced three deep in aim at the eighth
pole, vied with BODIE CODY in the final sixteenth, shook free and held on under a driving finish. SPINNING KITTEN tracked the pace and saved ground
down the backstretch, waited for a clear path late on the far turn, altered four wide upper stretch and finished well. BODIE CODY settled nicely near
mid-range, launched a three wide bid on the far turn, vied gamely for the lead with the winner in the final sixteenth then lacked a closing kick. PREACHER
MARSEE tracked the top two leaders to the far turn, waited for a clear path at the quarter pole then angled out set down five wide for the drive and lacked

Footnotes
BLEWITT broke to the lead and angled inside around the first turn, set the pace with STONE HANDS not far back, pulled away with willingly response
around the far turn then continued well clear and kept to task in late stages. MORETTI raced two to three wide and tracked the pace down the backstretch,
launched a bid on the far turn, remained in steady pursuit but was no match for the clear winner and settled for second best. YOUNGEST OF FIVE rated
through early going then was ridden along two wide to maintain tempo midway down the backstretch, continued a steady bid around the far turn then
churned on two to three wide for a share. ADMIRE tracked the pace along the inside, roused along the inside and gained position on the far turn then gave
way in the lane. INDIAN COUNSELOR was unhurried, saved ground into stretch and passed tiring foes. GRAN OMERO (VEN) raced off the pace then
widest into stretch and had no late response. KINGSVILLE rated in range down the backstretch then weakened on the far turn. TO DARE raced five to six
wide and had no late response. STONE HANDS was forwardly placed down the backstretch then came up empty and dropped back.

Footnotes
PASSION FACTOR was well rated and tracked the pace down the backstretch, headed in pursuit late on the far turn, roused forward and raced four deep in
close range at the furlong marker, continued to gain under strong left handed urging, angled in to race two wide late, exchanged head bobs with ACT LIKE
ARTIE and got a head up in final stride. ACT LIKE ARTIE raced near midpack and saved ground down the backstretch, was patiently handled around the
far turn then advanced up the inside to vie for the lead at the furlong marker, shook by DUR A CUIRE then battled back with the winner deep stretch,
exchanged head bobs and got denied in final strides. DUR A CUIRE set a pressured pace down the backstretch then vied for the lead around the far turn,
battled on gamely past the furlong marker then was all out in final stages. VALLETTA pressed the pace down the backstretch, vied for the lead around the
far turn, remained in striking range in the final furlong then checked sharply when then winner took path near the sixteenth pole. CAPABLE settled through
early stages then prompted two wide on the far turn, continued a bid up the inside in the lane, showed interest but needed more for impact. TUFF BIRD
rated off the early pace then hustled along three wide into stretch, tipped out wider and stayed under steady pressure but lacked the needed kick for impact.
NOT A PROBLEM raced off the early pace then five to six wide entering the lane and lacked a needed rally. FAVORITE SIN was unhurried then hustled
along five to six wide and could not muster a needed rally. MIGHTY ROAD saved ground into stretch then came out a couple paths and posed no threat.
STARSHIP BLANCA was reserved in the back, saved ground and failed to move into contention. NO MORE STORIES stalked the top pair down the
backstretch, launched a three wide bid entering the far turn then emptied out in the lane. MIDNIGHT MARVEL reared up fractiously at the break, trailed
briefly then pulled up and walked off.
