Footnotes
AUNT SUNSHINE with the early pace outside, vied three wide into the lane, cleared to the inside late in the bend, maintained a daylight advantage to the
wire under steady handling. MISS CASEY BETH behind the first flight along the inside, steered out into the two path midway on the turn, advanced on the
winner late in the bend, proved no match for that rival in the drive, clearly second best. DAT GIRL in mid pack early, moved out to be three wide into and
through the turn, could do little the top two through the stretch, well clear of the others. COUVERTURE lacked early foot after breaking a step slow, raced in
the two path turn, some traffic late in the bend, flattened out through the lane. PRINCESS SIMONE off a step slow, raced back, steered out turning for home
to improve around a rival into the stretch, improved position through the stretch while not a serious threat. ESTHER void of speed, remained back while off
the inside, angled out a bit wider entering the stretch, showed some belated interest while also not posing a serious menace. LAURA N LUKAS mid pack
and inside, saved ground to no avail. ARKANSAS INVASION lacked early foot, four wide out of the turn, failed to muster a rally. SING A SONG TOO vied
up front between horses and inside the winner for three furlongs and gave way. DO ME A FAVOR broke alertly, also raced with the pace, showed the way
into the turn, faltered as well. CLOUDYWITHACHANCE tired while racing outside. HAMAZING MARNIE was finished early.

Footnotes
SHE'S A DIME void of early foot, saved ground while remaining back in the turn, crept closer late in the bend, encountered some traffic entering the stretch,
switched out when straightened for home, closed with good resolve while widest to be up in time. STAYTHIRSTYMYAMIGO in mid pack early out in the
strip, four wide through the turn when beginning to rally, lodged a bid inside the furlong marker, led late, could not contain the winner. RANSOMED forwardly
placed off the inside, moved to challenge in the two path late in the turn, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, could not last. COUNCIL RULES
in the main body outside, three out to four wide turning for home, went evenly late in lacking a solid closing kick. STURDY ONE moved up inside to show
the way into the turn, continued to vie into and through upper stretch, faltered in the late going. ZELLA ROSE devoid of early foot, swung out to be six wide
for the drive, improved slightly while not posing a serious threat. TIZANILLUSION within striking distance early inside, had little left for the drive. SWEET
TATUM forced the issue for a half and gave way. JOSIE THE E F FIVE tired while five wide into the stretch.

Footnotes
NAPOLEON'S EMPIRE settled off the early leaders outside, began to advance while four wide far turn, took over, dropped toward the inside late in that
bend, clear in the two path into the stretch, continued to lead by a wide margin midstretch, enough left to hold the runner up safe late.
ANOTHRDAYATTHELAKE lacked early foot after clipping heels nearing the wire the first time, came in the two path into the stretch, improved through traffic
upper stretch, finished well to be rapidly getting to the winner. WINGS UP void of early foot, moved out to be four wide when advancing into the stretch,
chased the winner past the furlong marker, could do little more with that one late, no match for the runner up. DEALIN' STELEN came in slightly to help
tighten up ANOTHRDAYATTHELAKE, raced forwardly just off the inside, dropped to the rail around a tiring rival midway on the far turn, went evenly through
the stretch. JUSTIN ZEE void of speed, in some traffic when advancing late in the final turn, continued to improve position when clear for the drive. JAPEDO
settled in mid pack off the inside, came up empty when called on for the drive. TELETAP forwardly placed while racing off the inside for six furlongs, tired in
the drive. LISTEN TO ROSE saved ground when with the main body much of the way, lacked a response in the stretch. FREE INDEED in a bit tight after
the start, moved up to force the issue early, took over before a half, faltered when in turn replaced on the lead by the winner in the second turn. DOWN
HOME KITTEN tired while racing three wide. HARD TO IMPRESS last to leave, four wide exiting the final turn when still well back, failed to rally. MOON
DOG SPOT broke out then got out to tighten up outer rivals, pace, stopped, eased into lane.

Footnotes
FLATOUTANDFOXY void of early foot, began a steady advance after a half along the inside, steered to the outside for the drive, up in time. OPERATIC
void of early foot, continued back while three wide into the far turn, fanned five wide turning into the stretch, drifted out past the furlong marker, finished
willingly to gain the nod for the place in the final strides. INDIAN BELLA broke alertly, prompted the early leader off the inside, dueled into the far turn, took
over, clear past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, lost the nod for the place in the final stride. MISS MERCKEN lacked early foot while four
wide into the first turn, settled the middle half, four wide again into the stretch, lacked the necessary closing kick. URBAN KAT broke back, lacked speed
while saving ground, steered out to be three wide by midway on the final turn, improved position, no real threat. DUTCH TREAT settled in mid pack in the
two path, came up empty for the drive. PRETTI SAVI prompted the pace while four wide through the first turn, continued to race forwardly and outside, four
wide again in the second turn, tired. MUCHA MEZQUINA set the early pace inside, dueled with the winner the middle half while remaining closest to the rail,
weakened in the drive. BLUNT FORCE saved ground to no avail as she had little left late. FROZEN HANNAH forwardly placed for a half, stopped. ICY
DAWN off a step slow, moved up to mid pack while four wide through the first turn, stopped after a half, far back.

handling. RIVER FINN steered out to be three wide behind the pace in the first run, closer far turn, bid, long drive, outkicked in the late oing. PEPPER PIKE
off a step slow, raced back, continued to lack speed through the final turn, in the two path turning for home, steered out, finished with good late energy to be
up in time for the show. ICECAP in mid pack while saving ground, moved a bit closer while along the inside into the lane, some traffic with a furlong
remaining, finished up evenly when clear. NEW EAGLE raced back off the pace toward the inside, moved out, four wide into the lane when moving on the
leaders, bid, brief lead, faltered. BAOZUN within striking distance off the inside, four wide into the far turn, three wide and between horses into the stretch,
had little left late. GANGLY in the main body while off the inside, four wide and in some traffic late in the final turn, failed to respond in the drive. QUANA

Footnotes
LOUISE THE LASER close up early toward the inside, closer two path, bid between horses turning for home, dueled past the furlong marker, dug in with a
late push to earn the dead heat. ORDAINED KISS prompted the issue early outside, moved on the leader in the three path late turn, put a head in front soon
after, showed the way past the furlong marker, enough left to finish on equal terms with LOUISE THE LASER. SHE'S A LUCKY ONE broke back, lacked
speed, came in the two path into the lane, moved out wide, finished well to be getting to the top two at the wire. KALLISTE ROSE forwardly place, came
three wide into the lane while remaining within striking distance, lacked the necessary closing response. DARPA went one pace along the inside, steered
around a tiring rival late late, continued evenly to the wire. CONVINCE bumped at the start, was slow to settle when rank early, three wide turn, passed tiring
rivals. IVY'S COLLEGE FUND bumped at the start, four wide into the turn, lacked a closing response. C C'S BABY GIRL lacked a rally while racing off the
inside. ELIZABETH RULES moved up after the start to show the way into the turn, clear midway on the turn, faltered when headed enter the stretch while
along the inside. LIPPY lacked speed, three wide turn, improved slightly then flattened out to give way. CRITTER off a step slow, raced back, dropped
inside for the turn, was not a factor. ROCKING SHOES broke sharp, raced forwardly into the turn, steadied while between horses early in the bend, faded.

Footnotes
RAGTIME BLUES briefly restless in the gate, broke alertly, cleared to the inside, showed the way into and through the turn, shook off a rival turning for
home, well clear, enough left late to last. BACKSHOT within striking distance early inside, angled out steadily to be three wide late in the turn, roused for the
drive, finished with good courage to miss while outside the winner. MISTER KELLY within striking distance in the two path, lacked a winning response,
finished up best of the rest. CAVALRY CHARGE back early foot the pace, raced three out to four wide turn,displayed a mild amount of late interest, not
enough for the show. GOLDEN NOTION roughed at the start, was asked a bit to move up to mid pack, three wide through the turn, flat in the drive. BIG
CHEDDAR broke out, went evenly inside. DERBY DATE pressured the winner from the outside for three furlongs, tried that one late in the turn, faltered in
the drive. SHANGHAI'S DREAM broke out to help rough up GOLDEN NOTION, was finished early in remaining back. AHNAF broke back and was never a
factor. LITTLE INSTIGATOR broke in, bothered for, was also always back.

NEW COLOSSUS unhurried early, swung out five wide exiting the turn when advancing, finished full of run to win going away. MORNING SNOW raced in
mid pack and outside, four wide through the turn, set down for the drive, ground out the place while no match for the winner. HIDDEN RULER moved up the
opening quarter to vie off the inside, dueled turn, gained the advantage when straightened for home, continued to hold the advantage past the furlong
marker, could not contain the top two late, comfortably saved the show. MAKE NOISE steered out to be five wide midway up the backstretch, continued well
wide through the turn, improved position stretch while remaining widest. JULIUS turned in an even effort while racing just off the inside. TRUCK SALESMAN
back off the early pace, moved closer in some traffic late in the turn, continued to be surrounded upper stretch, improved slightly when clear the final furlong.
VICE VERSA forwardly placed while racing three wide, weakened in the drive. SABRENA'S BLING void of speed, failed to emance. IMPRESSED prompted

Footnotes
VOLATILE broke sharp, dueled up front in the two path, disposed of the other speed entering the stretch, won as rider pleased, ridden out in a sharp effort.
STRIKE THAT moved up just after the start to duel inside the winner, equal terms through the turn, proved no match for that rival in the drive, remained
clear for the place. D' RAPPER settled in the second flight early in the two path, dropped to the rail nearing mid turn, saved ground into the lane, finished up
best of the rest. STROLLING broke back, continued to lack speed, three down to two path turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. IMMA
BLING within striking distance outside, raced four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, lacked a closing kick. OLIVER raced in mid pack while outside, five
wide into the turn, went evenly through the lane also to be found lacking late. BATTLE STATION in the second flight off the inside, two path into the stretch,
no kick as well. TUT'S REVENGE forwardly placed while racing three wide, steadily faded. PETE'S PLAY CALL off slowly, remained always back while four
wide out of the turn. HOT SHOT KID was also always outrun. MIDNIGHT SWAP trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
NO PAROLE away in good order, set the pace inside, shook clear in the turn, roused upper stretch, well clear, geared down late to win ridden out.
AMERICAN BUTTERFLY lacked speed, saved ground while continuing under patient handling, good trip along the rail into the lane, no match winner,
clearly second bdest. RAGER void of speed, two path through the turn, dropped to the rail for the drive, up for the show late. LIAM'S PRIDE settled in mid
pack off the inside, in some traffic late in the turn, chased the top two past the furlong marker, caught for the show late. ROYAL COMMISSION settled off
the pace, three wide into the turn, four wide out, went one paced to the wire in lacking a late response. MR. TIP off a step slow, failed to menace while
racing three wide. MOONACHIE within striking distance toward the inside, tired in the drive. BUBBA BLING broke back, was never a threat. JUGGERNAUT
pressed the winner from the outside for a half and gave way. HAPPY HOUR COWBOY forwardly placed for a half while racing three wide, backed up in the
drive.
