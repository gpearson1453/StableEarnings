QUALITY raced in range along the inside around the turn, tipped out three wide upper stretch, stayed on with response and nipped foes for place. CALL

then got edged late for a placing. EXTREMELYEXCLUSIVE raced three wide into the turn then chased widest in the lane and had a mild improve. OFFICER
COUNTRY angled to the inside after the start, was not far back then waited briefly near the three eighths pole, hustled along the inside around the turn then
angled out upper stretch and needed more. VIOLENT FIGHT raced near the rear then four wide in upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. CONCORDE'S
DREAM raced off the pace then put to pressure along the far outside entering the lane and offered no late bid. NINTH OF APRIL angled in from the outside
and raced in contention around the turn, was forced to steady when SHES JUST QUALITY angled out in upper stretch then faded. SPEEDY HANS moved
in from the widest position and raced in aim entering the turn, remained a strong factor around the turn then tired in the drive. BORGOBYTHESEA raced two
wide around the turn and failed to move into close contention. SAM'S SPIRIT saved ground to no avail. THE RIDER OF #12 LODGED CLAIM OF FOUL

Footnotes
BIBIANA bumped with rival just after the start then picked up the pace and quickly advanced into strong contention, swept by the embattled duo on the turn
then continued to pull away while racing in hand. MARKISTAN hustled up from the get-go, kept under a drive five to six wide through the lane and got up for
place. MYSTIC COMIN HOME vied for the lead racing outside of COOL LILY LOU then got overhauled by eventual winner midway on the turn, remained in
pursuit and churned on for a share. CABRINA steadied at the start, raced off the pace then produced a mild bid in stretch and improved position. COOL
LILY LOU vied for the lead racing inside of MYSTIC COMIN HOME in early stages, was over taken by the winner on the turn the gave way in the lane.
GREY JAZMINE raced two wide in the last flight, remained well off the pace moving into the lane and failed to move into contention. NEW YORK
COMMANDER showed response in opening stages then steadily weakened. TRULY AMBITIOUS raced in range along the rail while under slight restraint,
came under some mild prompting near the quarter pole and had no response. JANE raced off the pace along the outside and failed to move into contention.
IMA DAREDEVIL raced along the outside and offered no bid. SYLLABUS bumped with the winner just after the start, angled inside to save ground and
failed to be a factor.

PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL held a slim lead in opening stages then came under attack from TALKTHETALK, matched strides around the turn, shook free
entering the lane, drew off to easy lead and kept to task while ridden out in late stages. TALKTHETALK bobbled at the start and lost a couple lengths on the
field, quickly picked up the pace then steadied while trying to gain equal terms with PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL, vied around the turn then failed to be a match for
the winner and settled for second best. QUIET ALL AROUND raced four wide in range early, coaxed three wide around the turn then failed to gain closer
contention in the stretch. AFROLINA dropped back early then galloped home.

Footnotes
MIMINA'S TEAM settled nicely while rated in range to the far turn, tipped out to race four wide at the quarter pole then given cue turning for home, drove by
near the furlong grounds then held late under strong handling. TOO SEXY secured inside position on the first turn, tracked the pace and saved ground down
the backstretch, waited patiently for a clear path around the far turn then produced a game rail up the inside in the lane. PUBLICATION was keen and raced
under a snug hold into the backstretch, remained under slight restraint then swung wide under a drive entering the lane, gained ground and switched in a
few paths, moved up closer on winner then switched out a path and continued to gain. LA BABIA was well placed and raced just off the top pair, continued
three wide in striking range around the far turn, remained in pursuit three to four wide near the furlong grounds then lacked closing response. AMERICAN
GODDESS led the way around the first turn, set a pressured pace down the backstretch, continued to put in a good effort and led the way at the head of the
lane then got overtaken nearing the furlong marker and weakened. CAT LADY applied pace pressure to AMERICAN GODDESS down the backstretch,
hustled along two wide racing in striking range around the turn then weakened in the lane. ALTAF was reserved and saved ground, shifted out six wide and
passed tiring foes. MISS FLYING SUN was off awkwardly at the start, rated off the pace and failed to rally in the lane. SURSUM CORDA raced off the pace,
came under a ride entering the lane, shifted out to race widest upper stretch and lacked the needed response for impact. KISS AND RUN raced off the pace
and saved ground to no avail. MARSH HARBOUR raced off the pace then wide in the lane and offered no late bid. SLIP SLIDING AWAY rated in good
position along the outside down the backstretch, failed to advance under pressure around the turn then gave way.

handed near the furlong marker then kept clear in late stages under a strong hand ride. WORTH AVENUE brushed with rival at the start and raced in the
back for the opening quarter, prompted along the outside around the turn, stayed on with response driving six wide in the lane and finished well. SUZ
bobbled at the start then quickly advanced to race up close just off the leader, could not gain closer contention on eventual winner around the turn then
chased on three wide in the lane for a share. TRUE HEIRESS brushed with foe a few times at the start then angled in to race near the inside, angled out
wider around the turn, stayed under a drive five wide near the furlong marker then offered no late bid. SALSA RITA chased in range along the inside then
faded in the lane. DIXIE PRINCESS raced four to five through early stages, coaxed in three path around the turn but could not muster a rally. TUESDAY'S
ROSE raced along the outside throughout and failed to gain a threatening position. FANCY FOX dropped out of contention then eased up in the lane.

Footnotes
FANCIFIED rated three to four wide down the backstretch, edged a bit closer near the quarter pole then given cue entering the lane, roused forward and
took command leaving the eighth pole and finished clear. LA RUSIA sped to the lead and crossed over to the inside entering the first turn, set a pressured
pace down the backstretch and around the far turn, kept on gamely to hold on top upper stretch then lost command to the winner past the furlong marker.
I'LL DO IT MY WAY was firmly rated along the inside down the backstretch, remained along the rail in close range on the far turn then produced a two to
three wide bid in the lane. RICHIES GREAT GIRL rated through early stages then swung out wide entering top of the lane and had a mild improve. DIENDA
pressed the pace to the far turn, continued to race in striking distance on the leader then tired in the drive. HARTLING secured inside position on the first
turn, saved ground into the lane and lacked a needed rally. DAYS OF SPRING raced in the back, saved ground into the lane and failed to move into
contention. JUST A BIT SASSY was stubborn to load then got off to a good start and steadied slightly entering the first turn, settled off the pace down the
backstretch, hustled up around the far turn then drifted out wide in upper stretch and offered no late bid. QUEEN FIELD was well placed sitting just behind
the top two leaders, remained a sharp contender around the far turn then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
ENVOUTANTE vied for the lead with ASSUME in the first turn and continued to duel down the backstretch, shook off foe midway on the far turn while
TOKEN loomed a danger, repelled bid then was sharp in response when roused for more entering top stretch and finished going away. TOKEN tracked the
pace along the inside, tipped out and loomed a danger to ENVOUTANTE nearing the quarter pole, put to a drive but failed to be a match for pulling away
winner and settled for second best. ASSUME vied for the lead on the first turn, continued to battle racing inside of winner into the turn, was no match for
rival near the five sixteenths pole then cleared the rest for a share. NEVER FORGET steadied in the first turn then rated in good position down the
backstretch, prompted three to four wide and remained in contention around the turn then faded. NEW HOPE ROAD raced four to five wide off the pace and
failed to move into close range. SWEDEN was not too far back early on then weakened around the far turn. ETANA was reserved saving ground, shifted out
and put to a drive but failed to move into range. REDEMPTION DAY fanned five wide entering the first turn, tracked the pace then retreated in the far turn.
BEAUTY BUZZ raced near the back, had no response and dropped far back then eased up in the lane.

commanding lead and finished in hand. TIPLE (IRE) raced near the rear then hustled along two to three wide without gaining around the turn, swung out
wide into the lane, finished with response along the far outside and captured place. MISS BEHAVE was ridden along the rail around the turn, switched out
three to four wide, continued a steady bid and got up late for show. TWICE AS MAGICAL raced two wide in aim for the lead around the turn, continued in
striking distance at the furlong grounds then lacked closing response and got edged out late for a placing. SMACK tracked the top two leaders along the
inside around the turn, went to make a move along the rail nearing the eighth pole, lacked racing room , came out a couple paths and never got going.
FALLEN LEAF sprinted to the lead then held a slim advantage around the turn, fought back holding a slim edge at the furlong marker then nothing left in
reserve and dropped back. BENTLEY'S DREAM chased three wide around the turn then offered no bid in the lane. SAYONARA BABY raced in the back
and had no response.

Footnotes
EVER DANGEROUS stalked along the inside down the backstretch, angled out and hustled up near the quarter pole, remained in game pursuit of the
leader then got by rival near mid-stretch and finished going away. BEAR ALLEY took over the early lead and set the pace down the backstretch, held firm
over challengers around the far turn then got collared by the winner near mid-stretch. THIS ILL DEFEND settled near mid-range, prompted along the outside
around the far turn, stayed on four wide upper stretch and got up for show. PHANTOM DANCE was unhurried along the inside, raced three wide into the
lane then shifted out wider and passed tiring foes. LASCARI (GB) stalked behind the pacesetter to the far turn, launched a two to three wide bid then gave
way in the lane. BATTALION raced off the pace then wide under strong handling through the lane and lacked a needed rally. CARDIAC KID raced in range
down the backstretch, failed to gain position under pressure around the far turn then weakened in the lane. LIMETINI was unhurried, raced wide in the lane
and offered no late bid. PRICING EXERCISE settled off the early pace, raced wide under pressure entering the lane then drifted in and failed to threaten.
BREAKAWAY ROMANCE raced in range down the backstretch then failed to advance under pressure around the far turn. RIVER STONES failed to move
into contention. WATER WALL raced near the inside and never reached contention.
