Footnotes
MIXTECA vied outside CAPELINE early, took over around the far turn, edged clear through mid stretch and responded well to preserve the decision.
TRULY advanced from midpack approaching the stretch in the two-path, moved out for the drive and was closing in late outside the winner. RASPBERRY
BALLET was devoid of early speed, saved ground on the far turn, moved around a tiring CAPELINE finding her best stride through the furlong grounds, and
finished with good energy on the fence. NOBLE MARIA saved ground in easy striking range early, shifted out three wide to loom a threat past the
quarter-pole, had aim outside the leader through the lane but flattened out late. FUNNY FEATHER was in a bit tight going to the first turn, spent
considerable time in the two-path and turned in an even effort without threatening. BIT COIN QUEEN bumped lightly with TINY TURBO at the start, took the
first turn in the four-path, moved in after that and lacked a rally. CAPELINE vied inside the winner for six furlongs, and gave way on the rail through the
stretch. BETTIN ONNA KITTEN bobbled slightly at the start, steadied to the first turn three wide, and was empty on the rail in the stretch. MATCHA tracked
outside the leaders three wide, and tired after six furlongs. WICKET HOPE was in a bit tight to the first turn three wide, had the rider drop the whip near the
three-eighths, and dropped far back. TINY TURBO bumped lightly with BIT COIN QUEEN at the start, was strung out widest in the five-path to the
backstretch, and dropped far back before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
MYSTIC COMIN HOME sped clear after the start, maintained the advantage fending off several foes around the turn, opened up again in the two-path in
upper stretch, and had just enough to hang on. MARKISTAN moved to contention four to five wide approaching the stretch, rallied steadily and just missed
outside the top one. IMPRESSION GIVEN had a ground-saving trip and lacked a solid bid. BELLA GIANNA stumbled at the start, stayed in range four wide
on the turn, and flattened out in the stretch. CRYSTALINA bumped with C EST FAST after the start, advanced mildly five wide late on the turn, and passed
tired foes outside. DAT HOT MATCH pressed the pace between horses into the turn, and faded steadily after three-eighths of a mile. POWERFUL WORDS
was outrun three wide. PERSONALLY was outrun inside. COOL LILY LOU broke in bumping C EST FAST at the start, pressed the pace outside, and
faltered in the drive. C EST FAST was bumped between horses just after the start, and retired early. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
CAT'S ASTRAY grabbed the lead inside after the start, shook off pursuers approaching the stretch, extended the margin under a drive through the furlong
grounds, and was hand ridden the last sixteenth to win comfortably. PRINCESS CARRIGAN saved ground for three furlongs, had aim outside the winner
into the lane but could not make an impression, and saved the place between horses. TAKE THE OVER was outsprinted to the stretch, rallied mildly on the
rail and just missed second. PLAY THAT TONE raced three then four wide around the turn, and gained mildly outside late. PALACE TWO STEP pressed
the early pace between horses, and faded in the stretch. STATED was a step slow at the start, made no headway despite urging on the turn, stayed on the
rail for the drive and lacked clear sailing in the last 70 yards. BALLIE'S DREAM gave chase outside the leaders to the quarter-pole, and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
CHASE RUNNER took a short early lead inside, shifted to the two-path going along comfortably around the turn, responded when set down for the drive and
was never in serious danger. KRACHENWAGEN followed behind the leaders saving ground for six furlongs, attempted to slip through inside CHASE
RUNNER at the top of the lane but did not have enough to get up in there, and ran on with good courage to best the others. DISCREET HEAT prompted the
pace outside the winner to the end of the turn, and faded gradually. UNBRIDLED HOLIDAY stayed in striking range outside early, and tired after six
furlongs. MR CHAPLIN raced four wide around the turn, and tired. COOL GIZMO brushed the right side of the gate at the start, and was finished before
reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
GRAY'S FABLE took the lead at once, rated along inside early, picked up the pace approaching the stretch and remained well in command under steady
pressure. ASTRONAUT was never far back, came under a ride midway on the far turn, could not menace the winner but dug in to take the place. HOLY
MEISTER raced three to four wide, advanced approaching the stretch, gained only mildly and was outbattled outside ASTRONAUT for second.
GHOSTLORE saved ground to the far turn, shifted three wide leaving the quarter-pole and rallied mildly for a share. PALACE KITTEN prompted the pace
outside GRAY'S FABLE for six furlongs, and tired. RAG TAG brushed with TIO WIL and steadied in tight entering the first turn, had the rider lose the whip
early on the far turn, and made no headway. COASTAL DEFENSE got floated out to the five-path by SMIRK into the first turn, and never reached
contention. SMIRK was four wide into the first turn, and showed little. GHOST ON A MISSION was outrun throughout. TIO WIL steadied in tight brushing
with RAG TAG entering the first turn, and was done early three wide.

POSEIDEN chased inside early, moved out near the quarter-pole to go after BIG SPENDER, wore that rival down in deep stretch and edged clear. BIG
SPENDER bumped with BROADWAY PETE at the start, set the pace in the two-path to the turn, fought back when challenged in the stretch, and yielded
grudgingly inside the winner. FLAWLESS MOON advanced four wide around the turn to loom a threat, but flattened out in the drive. WAR ACT had an
inside trip and finished evenly. POPPY'S DESTINY pressed the pace between horses into the turn, and began to fade approaching the stretch. LUCKY
RUNS NORTH faded steadily three wide. BROADWAY PETE bumped with BIG SPENDER at the start, and retreated on the turn. NOT NOW RAND was no
factor outside.

Footnotes
MECHA CORTA broke readily, assumed command and angled to the inside, set a pressured pace with CARMICHAEL forcing the issue into the far turn,
dueled for the lead racing inside of aforementioned rival into stretch run, battled on gamely, took a slim lead and refused to be denied. CARMICHAEL
applied pace pressure to MECHA CORTA out of the chute and forced the issue to the far turn, dueled positioned outside of the MECHA CORTA into the
lane, battled on with solid response but could not get by the winner deep stretch. DISTORTED MOON settled near the inside through early stages, angled
out and headed in pursuit around the far turn, continued a steady five wide bid and prevailed for a share. GUACO tracked the pace through early stages,
launched a bid for the top pair on the final turn then flattened three to four wide in the lane. LEXATOGA moved out to race widest in opening stages and
rated off the top two flights, was put to pressure on the far turn then raced wide into the lane and could not muster a needed rally. HOLY EMPEROR stalked
along the inside down the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and had no response when called upon. SENZAZIONE raced off the pace and two
wide leaving the backstretch, failed to advance under pressure then raced wide into the lane and offered no late bid. SEIZE THE HAY raced in the back,
had no response and eased up in the lane.

Footnotes
WHERE PARADISE LAY raced in range along the outside around the turn then advanced to race three deep in striking range in the final sixteenth,
exchanged head bobs with HARD BELLE in final strides and edged by in time. HARD BELLE was forwardly placed along the inside then angled out and
advanced to the lead at the quarter pole, continued with a slim advantage with a furlong left to run, dug in gamely under pressure and got edged out in final
strides. SOUTH SEA steadied at the start when rival drifted over then steadied while in tight nearing the half mile marker, roused two wide around the turn
and continued in striking range with a furlong left to run then lacked a strong closing response. FRONT LOADED raced along the outside while not too far
off the pace on the turn, fanned six wide entering the lane and ran on evenly. NOON TIME GEM made contact with VINCERO and steadied a stride nearing
the half mile marker, dropped top last then raced five to six wide under pressure in the lane and improved position without threatening. BRASS COMPASS
drifted out at the start then raced up close in early stages, failed to advance on the turn then faded in the lane. VINCERO got bumped and steadied nearing
the half mile marker and faded. HARRYHEE led the way through early stages, got collared for the lead near the quarter pole then tired in the drive.

GOODBYE BROCKLEY vied for the lead positioned outside a duo down the backstretch, shook free on the final turn, roused four wide into the lane,
widened to a clear advantage and stayed sharp under steady pressure. ZARINA got bumped and pinched back at the start, raced off the pace along the
inside, picked up the pace on the far turn, roused three to four wide into stretch run then came out wider late and held firm for runner up spot. ALWAYS
SHOPPING dueled between foes down the backstretch, could not move on with the winner on the turn but continued a steady bid along the outside in the
lane and cleared the rest. STARSHIP NALA tracked the pace down the backstretch, launched a three to four wide bid on the far turn but failed to make
headway then faded in the lane. RIDEFORTHECAUSE rated off the early pace, urged two to three wide for response on the far turn but could not gain
closer contention then offered no late bid. HIGH ROAD vied for the lead down racing inside of a duo down the backstretch then gave way on the far turn.
ART OF ALMOST raced along the outside and failed to respond. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
CAUSALISTIC settled nicely while sitting just off the second flight, commenced a outside bid around the turn, hustled along five wide into the lane then
drifted out wider under left handed pressure, remained determined in pursuit of BLOOD MOON through stretch run and edged by in final strides. BLOOD
MOON set the uncontested pace through early stages and continued to lead the way into upper stretch, continued to put in a good effort trying to hold onto
a diminishing lead then edged out deep stretch. LIKE YOU stalked the leader down the backstretch, hustled up two wide around the turn then sustained
steady bid through the lane to secure a share. GEMO tracked the pace two to three, launched a bid around the turn, shifted the rail at head of the lane then
gave way near mid-stretch. PERFECT REVENGE raced wide and reserved through early stages, came under a ride on the turn then stayed on wide into the
lane and failed to move into contention. PLATO raced off the pace and had no response when called upon.

MISS AURAMET quickly cleared on top and remained loose on top around the turn, raced two wide entering top stretch then put to a drive past the furlong
marker, kept on gamely and held clear under a driving finish. DAY BY DAY raced in range along the outside then headed in pursuit for MISS AURAMET
around the turn, kept on determinedly along the outside in the lane but could not get to the winner in time. NIKEE KAN chased the early leader and saved
ground into stretch run, came off the inside and flattened upper stretch but stayed on for a share. CELIA'S SONG hustled along in steady pursuit and raced
three wide around the turn then failed to advance under pressure in the lane. SANITY raced off the early speed, roused six wide into stretch run and lacked
a needed rally. V J'S BET hustled along three to four wide and posed no threat. STYLISHLY was sent hard from the gate but was outpaced, kept under
strong handling into the lane but had no rally. ORIGINATOR steadily faded along the inside.
