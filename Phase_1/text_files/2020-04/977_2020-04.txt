Footnotes
CLEAN LIVING off alertly from the outside, made an easy lead an opened up a comfortable advantage, angled over to the inside, continued to lead well
nearing the eighth pole, lugged inward in the stretch, corrected course and won easy under left-handed encouragement. SLIGHTLY chased the pace three
wide off the rail, traveled two wide through the turn and into the lane, showed a mild response in the lane but never threatened the winner. AVO went thee
deep up the backstretch, dropped back a bit and angled to the inside, saved ground around the turn and also failed to threaten. FOREST WILDFLOWER
leaned back and off a bit slow to begin, traveled between foes up the backstretch, went outside a rival and three wide around the turn and weakened in the
drive.

LEEDSLIMIT displayed early foot and kicked clear of WHATAHANDSOMECAT, angled in steadily to the turn, traveled in the two path to the lane and held
safely under a drive. CAPTAIN N. BARRON between rivals early then advanced off the inside, chased two wide through the turn, closed through the lane
and was gaining on the winner to the wire. YODELERS WAY tracked from a bit off the rail, saved ground around the turn and held the show.
WHATAHANDSOMECAT broke well and pressed the pace shortly before chasing the leader up the backstretch from a bit off the rail, went two to three wide
around the turn and finished evenly in the final furlong. HOSS CARTWRIGHT veered out at the start, chased from the outside, went four to five wide around
the bend and lacked a rally. CHOCOLATE MESS off the rail in the early going, angled in entering the turn, raced a bit off the rail through the bend and was
not persevered with late.
