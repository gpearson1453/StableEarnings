Footnotes
MOCHA KISS broke with the leaders, stalked the pace off the inside, advanced on the leader in the second turn, challenged three wide into the lane, dueled
to the wire, proved best under steady handling. DIXIE WAYNE also within striking distance, moved toward the front along the inside with the winner late in
the final turn, rail bid, dueled to the wire, outkicked to be second best. LYNNE T settled off the pace toward the inside, in the two path in the second turn,
went evenly through the lane to finish best of the rest. RICH PRINCESS broke on top, dueled early just off the inside, clear before a half, briefly offered
resistance when confronted by the winner from the outside and allowing the runner up the inside turning for home, gradually weakened after losing the
advantage in upper stretch. ELLA'S MY GIRL well back early, four wide through the second turn, improved into the lane, failed to sustain that advance in the
run to the wire. BE DONE WITH IT void of early foot, continued back, three wide in some traffic in the second turn, improved into the lane with some mild
late interest, not a serious factor. ALITTLEBITOFSMARTY off a step slow, well back early, continued to lag into the far turn, picked off some tiring rivals
while also not posing a serious threzat. DRAMATIC ENTRANCE broke in and back, tucked in to save some ground in the first turn, rode the rail in the
second bend, failed to mount a rally. BRAHMS IS WHO fell bar back after the start, trailed well back into the far turn, passed tiring rivals after the issue had
been decided. DIXIE LOVING broke in, five wide into the first turn, began to tire in the three path final turn. SILENT NIGHT SKY dueled early in the three
path, began a general retreat before a half. DUES PAID rank, steadied in some traffic into the first turn, stopped after a half.

Footnotes
ADMIRAL BROWN in the second flight while between foes, asked along and steered out three wide late in the turn, took over, quickly clear, ridden out.
MARSHALL HILL outrun in the early going, rallied three wide out of the turn, up for the place, no match for the winner. SUPER TERRIFIC back off the pace
while outside, five wide through the turn, along for the show while also no threat to the winner. THE DEVILS BACK void of early foot, moved out a bit late in
the turn, improved position through the stretch while finding his best stride too late. BAQUERO FLIES also back in the early going, three wide through the
turn, steered toward the inside through the bend, improved slightly while closest to the inside of the second group. RIDE TO THE WIRE within striking
distance off the inside, floated out four wide outside the winner turning for home, lacked a closing kick. SEEK N JUSTICE narrowly set the pace along the
inside, vied into the lane, and faltered. ICE SPHERE with the pace off the inside for a half and gave way. TELETAP lacked early foot, was never a factor.
AH YEAH forwardly placed for a half, backed up. JOHNNY CHADDA off a step slow, always outrun. BLOWINTHEBLUESAWAY mid pack outside, gave
way turn, pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN CENTS settled along the inside, moved closer while continuing to save ground through the second bend, challenged past the furlong marker
along the rail, proved best under firm handling. SANTA ANA WINDS last to leave, raced well back, rallied three wide out of the final turn, finished willingly to
annex the place while also getting to the winner in the waning strides. WEEKEND MADNESS settled off the inside, began a steady advance after a half, two
path into the lane, moved out further, finished up best of the rest while inside the runner up. HUSH Y'ALL in tight at the start, moved inside to save ground,
continued along the inside into the lane, moved out then steered back in when improving past the furlong marker, flattened out a bit to not have enough to
contend for the place. FIESTA IN VEGAS broke on top, clear into the first turn, larger lead the middle half, offered brief resistance to the winner when that
one challenged a furlong out then faltered. SHAKE IT UP TRACY chased the leader off the inside, had little left for the drive. MUCHO MAS settled off the
pace while three wide, came up empty for the drive. BIG AFFAIR broke out, raced within striking distance while in the three path, gave way in the drive.
BALLYBRACK LASS in mid pack while along the inside, saved ground to no avail. FIFTHATNARRAGANSET came out to be four wide into first turn,
finished after a half. GHAALEB'S STORM in mid pack for a half, finished far turn while four wide. TELL ME IM PRETTY floated wide into the first turn, was
always outrun.

Footnotes
SWISS MINISTER away well, dueled up front closest to the inside, continued to alternate through the turn and into the stretch, headed a furlong out, battled
back in game fashion to narrowly prevail. RED CLAY MAGIC within striking distance off the inside, floated out into the four path turning for home, set down
for the drive, finished willingly to miss. STORMINSIDE dueled up front in the two path and outside the winner, put a head in front of that foe with a furlong
remaining, outfinished by that same foe while unable to contain the runner up, finished between the top two at the wire. POCKET PERSONALITY settled off
the pace and the inside, tilted out three wide turning for home, set down, ran with the runner up inside that one well out in the strip, not enough late. PARK
RIDGE BENNY off the pace and the inside, raced four out to five wide exiting the turn, improved position while not threatening the top four. DARK ARDEN
went one paced while racing off the inside. HAMAZINGLY RICH hesitated at the start, raced back and made little impact along the inside. PLUMBAGO void
of speed after moving to the inside, continued to save ground turn, improved through the lane by passing mostly tiring rivals. BETO in the second flight
early, tired while three out to four wide exiting the turn. KRISTO failed to rally while four wide through the turn. CULPER was never close. BIG SPORT in
mid pack early well out in the strip, continued four wide through the turn and tired.

Footnotes
VERVE'S HUMOR unhurried for five furlongs, steered out four wide late in the final turn when advancing, finished full of run down the middle of the strip to
be up in time. TRASHTALKINYANKEE four wide when off the pace in the first turn, continued outside, advanced while remaining in the four path through
the second bend, took over, led late but could not contain the winner while game for the place. GOLDEN SCEPTOR closest to the leader off the inside, bid,
between rivals midway on the second turn, held a slight advantage between rivals upper stretch, dueled with the runner up past the furlong marker, gave
ground grudgingly to the top pair late. HARD TO PARK settled off the pace and the inside, came five wide into the stretch when advancing, flattened out in
the final furlong. ORO DE TEJANO three wide when off the leaders first turn, moved inside to save some ground in the second turn, lacked a closing
response in the drive to finish up evenly. GOOD SCOUT pulled early when racing back off the pace, continued under restraint up the backstretch and into
the far bend, moved out three wide turning for home, came up empty. SHINING THROUGH last to leave, saved ground, picked off some tiring rivals while
not a factor. MOST AMUSING clear early to show the way into the first turn, continued to set the pace until confronted in the final turn and faltered.
SPEAKER VAN within striking distance behind the leaders, tired after five furlongs. NEW MEXICO forwardly placed three wide, brief bid between horses
and inside the runner up late in the final turn, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
DUNPH within striking distance along the inside, moved closer then checked up in tight quarters nearing the half mile marker, recovered, moved out,
challenged between rivals in upper stretch, long drive under a left then right handed stick, in some tight quarters with the runner up late, proved best while
being shown a left handed whip in the late going. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF EBBEN AGAINST DUNPH FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND. EBBEN settled off the pace and the inside, advanced outside,
challenged three wide into the lane, vied to the wire outside the winner, outfinished. VICTORY ELEMENT broke on top, showed the way into and through
the first turn, continued to set the pace up the backstretch and into the far turn, responded when challenged by the top two turning for home, gave ground
grudgingly until late. TEZ devoid of early foot, continued back in the two path into the far turn, worked out to be four wide late in the bend, managed some
late interest while too late for the show. ONE LAST STRIKE lacked speed inside, continued to save ground, improved inside of traffic into the lane, flattened
out a bit in the final furlong. LIGHTHAWK forwardly placed off the inside, closest to the leader far turn, gave way entering the stretch. COSMOLOGIST
settled in mid pack early, fell back the middle half, little impact in the drive. POST CLOSE five wide into the first turn, four wide onto the backstretch,
remained outside, four wide again in the second bend, came up empty for the drive. NICE WORK pressed the issue early off the rail, began a steady retreat
before four furlongs. TADEO was never a threat outside. TIGHT TEN forwardly placed while racing off the inside, also began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
PIECE OF MY HEART in the second flight toward the inside, challenged between rivals and took over midway on the second turn, well clear a furlong out,
held the runner up safe late under steady handling. STRONG FLAG unhurried early, moved out to be three wide late in the final turn when moving closer,
lugged in late, could not get to the winner. DREAMALILDREAMOFU forwardly placed while off the inside. closer then lodged a three wide bid in the second
turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive, finished up best of the rest. DAWN'S DANCER away in good order, showed the way through the first turn,
set the pace inside, weakened when replaced on the lead in the second turn. COMPELLING SMILE void of early foot inside, continued to save ground,
asked along while racing the rail second bend, improved position a bit, no real threat. EVIL LYN five wide into the first turn when within contact of the leader,
continued outside, faltered in the second turn. LADY MCKENZIE was never involved while racing off the inside. SEBS PRINCESS off a step slow, remained
always back. FASHIONABLY chased the leader for a half and stopped.

Footnotes
ABSOLUTELY AIDEN moved up the inside to set the pace, shook clear into the stretch, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. CANDY
CORNELL broke out, was straightened to press the winner off the inside, could not keep up with that one in the drive, clearly second best. NIFTY off a step
slow, trailed early inside, angled out late in the turn while in some traffic, managed some late gain while not a threat to the top two. KAUAI lacked speed,
steered out four wide late in the turn, improved position while also not a serious threat. MALPAIS lacked speed off the inside, three wide through the turn,
improved position. EXTIRPATOR forwardly placed outside, four wide into the turn, closer three wide exiting, weakened in the run through the stretch.
THERE AND BACK settled off the pace inside, had little left for the drive. TWO BIT KID off the pace while four wide through the turn, never dangerous.
PRINCIPE GUILHERME broke back, raced five wide into and through the turn, remained back. PETROV raced in mid pack, three wide and in some traffic
late in the turn, backed up through the stretch. DROP OF GOLDEN SUN was outrun while racing four wide. HILTON MAGIC retreated while racing off the
inside.

Footnotes
INSHANNITY away in good order, raced in the second flight, lost some ground to the leader exiting the turn, challenged that one late and showed good
resolve to prove best in the final strides. LIL MISS MOPPET broke sharp, narrowly set the pace along the inside, shook clear exiting the turn, maintained a
daylight advantage past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner in the late going, well clear of the others. TRAPPED N MY MIND lacked early foot,
steered out to be three wide late in the turn, rallied for the show while not a threat to the top pair. OFFERING void of speed after being last away, improved
while steering out to be three wide into the lane, no real threat. BLIP SAYS BYE pressed the winner off the inside, vied into the lane, weakened in the drive.
DIXIE NATION lacked speed, raced three wide into and through the turn, made little impact in the drive. FREEDOM PASSAGE went one paced while racing
well out in the strip. QUALITY TOO SPARE remained always back in showing little. TIPAZAR four wide through the turn when well back, failed to rally.
BARRACUDA settled off the pace and the inside, faded through the stretch. READY N WAITING away in good order, second flight in the two path, began to
fade just before a half.
