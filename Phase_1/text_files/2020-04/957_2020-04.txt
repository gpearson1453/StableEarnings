Footnotes
AUCTIONEER made the pace racing out about the three or four path, repelled a challenge into the lane then came in and out midstretch but held clear to
the wire. SHATTERED DREAMS was never far back racing three wide then could only mildly close the gap in the lane. WILD PAINT dropped back off the
pace racing three wide, rallied through the far turn then could not threaten in the lane. BIG TIME PLAYER moved up inside to challenge in the far turn but
had little left in the drive. CAPTAIN AMANTE was five and six wide through the far turn into the lane and lacked a rally. CAPTAIN JOHN was bumped at the
start, raced in reach of the pace while two or three wide, moved inside rivals through the lane and lacked some room through deep stretch. FLASH BROWN
followed the pace three or four wide and weakened. GOSPEL SOLDIER was not a threat. HEZA FORTUNE broke outward to bump rivals causing his rider
to lose irons, regained the irons through the first turn while near the early leaders but soon dropped out. LOGAN'S DEPUTY was shuffled back to last at the
start and trailed.

Footnotes
IRISH CONTESSA was three wide behind the early leaders in the first turn, moved inside heading up the backstretch to bid in the far turn, dueled inside
PERSONAL CAT through the lane and was just up in the final jump. PERSONAL CAT was on the pace outside HIT'N TIME early, continued with the winner
into the lane to duel to the wire and narrowly missed. DOROTHE MARIE rallied five wide to challenge through the far turn and have aim turning for home
but could not sustain the move. HEAVEN'S CREATION stalked the pace in good position four wide and weakened. HIT'N TIME was on the pace racing
about the two to three path, continued to late in the far turn and came up empty. CALIFORNIASUMMER lacked a rally racing three to four wide. YOU'RE
THE REASON followed the pace three wide and weakened. KINKY KIM saved ground and was not a factor.

POSSIBLY IN LOVE was on the pace outside DE CATS A COUGAR early, kicked clear in late backstretch and moved inside then kept safe in the lane
under steady handling. SHADE OF JUSTICE stalked the leaders three wide to move nearest the winner into the far turn then continued on to slowly close
the gap late. TEA AT NOON trailed early racing outside, moved five wide in the far turn and rallied through the lane but could not reach the top pair. BEE
MERRY tucked inside going to the first turn, saved ground to the lane and angled out but lacked a solid closing bid. PR SOMETHIN BETTER was in reach
racing three to four wide but lacked a rally. ACTIVE MERRY was no factor racing four to five wide. QUESTION MARKIE saved ground and was not a factor.
DE CATS A COUGAR contested the early lead inside the winner and tired.

LEGENDARY SONG tracked the leaders from three or four wide early, moved closer through the far turn then rallied through the lane to overtake KURIOUS
KENNEDY in the closing jump. KURIOUS KENNEDY was in tight at the break, saved ground behind the early leaders, rallied through the lane to lead deep
stretch but was caught in the closing jump. DREAMINGNDIAMONDS broke in the air but recovered to move up five wide outside rivals and challenge on the
lead through the first turn, opened the advantage going up the backstretch while moving inside, brought a clear lead into the lane but had nothing left left.
TREVOR'S FOREVER was three wide with the lead groupd early, continued to chase to upper stretch but lacked a final closing run. HOLY CABALLERO
moved up three or four wide while not a threat. ONE LITTLE INDY broke inward then lacked a rally racing three wide. MARK HER PRECIOUS broke to the
inside and was always back four wide. MS COMEDY TIME saved ground and was not a factor. LADYBUG'S HOLIDAY showed some early speed along the
inside and tired.

COLLEGE PARTY dueled on the early pace outside FRIEND OF DUBAI to kick clear going to the far turn then drew off in the lane under steady handling.
WITT LOVES TACOS saved ground off the early pace, angled out into the lane and moved up to gain the place but could not threaten the winner. FRIEND
OF DUBAI dueled on the early pace inside the winner to late backstretch then could not hold position in the lane. STRAIT N' SILENT moved up late three
and four wide and could not threaten late. MASTERPIECE DAY stalked the leaders from four wide and weakened in the drive. COLOR ME BEHOLD saved
ground and lacked a rally. MEMORY OF SWIM was not a factor racing three to four wide. GOOD OLD LUNCH BOX was bumped and shuffled back at the
break then was always back. DANCING FOR DE BUY chased the pace from three wide and tired. OLLIE'S PAPA'S BOY broke inward and bumped with a
rival causing him to stumble and unseat his rider then went riderless around the course with no mishap and was walked off.

DIRTY DIXIE ROAD showed speed inside rivals then settled back going up the backstretch and moved outside, rallied to bid from the four path and move
clear into the lane and held safe late under steady handling. INTOXICATING KISS stalked the pace three or four wide, angled outside the winner to be five
wide into the lane and slowly closed late. MEMORIES GALORE fanned six wide out of the first turn while at the back, remained outside to rally six wide into
the lane but could not get to the top pair late. ALONEATTHEBAR moved up three wide but could not threaten in the lane. LETS TANGO was not a threat
racing four and five wide. ELUSIVE DREAM was with the lead group early three wide and tired. P R GIRL CRUSH saved ground and tired. PANENA
TORNAI contested the lead four wide for a half and tired.

Footnotes
A BUNCH FOR LUNCH was last away but soon joined the leaders to force the issue outside HOWS MY GOLD, moved clear nearing the lane and held the
margin under steady handling. SPELL WINDER tracked the pace racing two and three wide and made a mild gain on the winner late. EMERALD POINT
saved ground to move up but could not threaten the top pair late. HOLY MARIE was three and four wide in reach of the pace but lacked a solid closing run.
HOWS MY GOLD was on the pace racing about the two or three path and had nothing left once headed nearing the lane. ALLY SONG was not a threat
racing two or three wide. UBETCHA IMA BUMPER was not a factor racing four wide. OUR ANABELLE was with the early pace three wide and tired.

Footnotes
MR. TICKLE was unhurried and saving ground to move up through the far turn, angled out nearing the lane and rallied to collar BLUE HARBOR through
midstretch and edge clear. BLUE HARBOR settled back off the leaders saving ground, moved three wide to bid into the far turn, rallied clear into the lane
then could not handle the winner's late. MAS MISCHIEF stalked the pace racing four and five wide to move in reach of the leaders going to the far turn then
could not sustain the rally into the lane. THETRASHMANSCOMING dropped well back off the field racing four wide, moved up into the lane but could not
threaten late. AMERICAN LEAGUE contested the pace outside BLABIMIR through the opening half mile, continued in reach to late in the far turn and had
nothing left. FOOLS RUSHIN was not a factor racing three wide. PHLASH DRIVE stalked the pace from four wide and tired. BLABIMIR showed the most
early speed to contest the pace inside AMERICAN LEAGUE, stopped suddenly nearing the far turn and was pulled up then walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
TREPI'S TRPL CROWN settled off the pace about four wide, moved out to rally six wide midway of the turn, continued the run into the lane and ran down A
J HART late. A J HART bumped with a rival at the start, stalked the pace three or four wide to bid into the lane then could not handle the winner's late run.
RANBIR tracked the leaders three wide to bid through the far turn as the field bunched then could not close ground late. MUCHO SUPER GIRL made the
pace on a short lead along the inside then could not sustain the run through the lane. ALEXANDRIAS THRONE saved ground early, angled three wide
heading up the backstretch to move up but lacked the needed late run in the drive. HININI saved ground and lacked a final closing bid. EUROSADY broke
into the side of the gate then bumped with a rival and failed to threaten while four and five wide. FIANNA HILLS was two and three wide in reach of the
pace, bid through the far turn then ran up heels and clipped then stumbled nearing the lane and lost momentum. JAMACIAN ME MONEY was always back.
JUST AUDACIOUS prompted the pace outside the leader to the far turn, remained in contention while moving in and tired.
