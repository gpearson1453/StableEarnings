Footnotes
BELLA LINDA, reserved near the inside racing to the backstretch, conceded some position under patient handling racing to the far turn, saved ground on
the second bend to upper stretch, then tipped out in late stages to just collar LITTLE MS BROADWAY in time under strong handling. The latter broke
sharply, sped to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin under light rating to the second bend, dueled for command inside foes to
regain a clear advantage midstretch and grudgingly resisted the winner to the end. BAIN TOWN WOMAN was settled last early, made a sharp advance
along the rail nearing the half mile marker to gain a position just off the pacesetter, briefly awaited an opening on the second bend, shifted out three deep
racing into the lane to challenge for command between foes but was outkicked by the top pair. NAGINI gained a position between foes in the second flight
racing to the backstretch, was caught three, then four wide entering the far turn while advancing in tandem with several rivals, angled to the rail racing into
upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position. DAKOTA BEACH, bumped lightly at the start, tracked the pacesetter between foes, then
inside rivals as part of the second flight, conceded some position when racing in close quarters entering the fart urn, shifted out while being urged to
advance midway through the far turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed final kick. ETTAPLACE, forwardly placed outside the
leader attending the pace in the opening half, lodged a brief bid between foes racing through the far turn and gave way into the stretch. SILENT DAY, held
up avoiding close quarters racing into the first turn, continued outside foes off the second flight to the backstretch, was caught five wide racing into the far
turn and steadily faded. TIME SHIFT tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight to the backstretch and faded after a half. ONE SHOT broke in making
light contact with DAKOTA BEACH, was held up, then steadied between foes avoiding tight quarters racing into the first turn, switched outside rivals gaining
position four wide after a half to briefly gain striking distance three deep nearing the far turn but quickly came up empty. CRACK OF DAWN, rank under
restraint while being steadied a bit racing into the first turn, was wrangled back while going erratically entering the backstretch and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
MALICED, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, continued with a steady bid in that path to challenge for command
racing into the far turn, gained the advantage nearing upper stretch and went clear under some right handed pressure. MIGHTY FROSTY, urged between
foes racing into the first turn forcing the pace outside a rival, dueled inside the eventual winner racing into the far turn, couldn't match that foe in the last
quarter but held rivals for the place honors. DARESCA tracked off the second flight just off the inside to the backstretch and improved position inside foes
racing into the stretch. GRANDMARY, brushed at the break, tracked the leaders three deep between foes in second flight to the far turn and continued
evenly through late stages. I AM A. LURING broke inwards brushing GRANDMARY, was urged inside rivals prompting the pace into the backstretch, lost
ground to the leaders on the far turn, shifted out four wide racing into the stretch and gave way between foes. VUYELWA switched outside rivals racing to
the backstretch to track just off the second flight, was fanned five wide through the stretch and faded late. WINDY COUNTY settled near the inside early and
failed to menace. GLOBALPRINCESSCOCO was a brief factor inside foes in second flight but dropped out early.

to the inside and held sway under firm encouragement. TRACY ANN'S LEGACY, urged inside the eventual winner prompting the pace, conceded some
position entering the turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch and continued with interest between foes to prevail for the place honors. SWEETLY MAID, urged
to gain a forward placing in the opening sixteenth, tracked just off the leaders along the inside, shifted out slightly entering the turn while racing in tight
quarters between foes, angled back to the rail entering the lane and gained some position. G Q GIRL, reserved in early stages while switching outside foes,
angled out five wide racing into upper stretch and made some belated progress. CHECOTAH tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, continued
three deep into the turn and weakened between foes late. SUNSET EMPIRE angled inwards to track between foes as part of the second flight early and
steadily faded into the stretch. HANDSOME GIRL, off a step slowly, angled inwards while settling last, shifted out four wide racing through the lane but had
no rally. PINS AND NEEDLES, caught in close quarters just after the start, angled to the inside tracking off the second flight and soon retreated.

ENJOY BASEBALL broke readily to gain terms with the first flight racing six, then five wide through the backstretch attending the pace under light rating,
was prompted to press the issue while shifting inwards racing into the bend, forged clear leaving the midway point of the turn and held sway on a
commanding margin to the end under some right handed pressure. BUFFALO MAX, caught in tight quarters at the start, was settled between foes racing
through the backstretch, split rivals four deep racing into the turn, angled out six wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for the
place honors. STRUM AND PLUCK settled outside the first flight racing five wide between foes, was prompted to advance four wide on the turn to upper
stretch to gain some position but had no final kick. THE EQUINEST tracked off the first flight three deep between foes on the backstretch, shifted out making
brief progress four wide racing into the turn but came up empty leaving midstretch. COMMANDER'S INTENT, forwardly placed along the rail in the opening
stages, steadily faded into the turn. THREE OLIVEZ angled inwards tracking off the first flight in the opening stages, swung out seven wide entering the lane
but had no rally, then was vanned off the course following the race. ARES WARRIOR tracked off the first flight five wide in the opening quarter, made brief
progress in that path racing into the turn but soon emptied out. CITY CAT, off slowly, was urged to terms with the first flight four wide between rivals
prompting the pace to the turn and soon gave out. DIAMOND DREAMER, urged between foes, then inside rivals prompting the pace to the turn, was spent
early. DUKE OF HEARTS came through close quarters to track off the first flight between foes in the opening quarter but dropped out early. POZNAN
angled inwards to press the pace three deep between foes into the turn but gave way after a half.

Footnotes
DANCERONTHEBEACH broke out bumping MEDAL OF FACT, was quickly righted to assume the advantage along the inside while under light rating
dictating the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, edged away racing into the far turn while turning back a rival's challenge and went clear under firm
handling. EMPTY HOLSTER tracked just off the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight, was prompted to advance on the far turn, shifted out three
wide entering the lane and proved best of the others. BATTLE CREEK swerved at the start bumping CASK, was righted to gain a position three deep
between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, continued in that path to the far turn, shifted inwards a bit racing through the stretch and continued
with interest to prevail for a share between foes. CASK, bumped soundly at the start, was collected to track outside foes in second flight to the backstretch,
was caught four wide on the far turn to upper stretch but continued with interest to make a mild gain. CLOUDBASED tracked off the second flight along the
inside in the opening half, saved ground to upper stretch but had no final kick. VALUABLE PILLOW, in touch with the first flight three deep, then four deep
racing to the backstretch while under firm rating, was urged to briefly press the issue outside the winner on the far turn but came up empty racing into upper
stretch. A DAY WITH CHRIS, caught a bit wide early, never gained contention. MEDAL OF FACT, bumped at the start, was righted to gain a forward placing
between foes prompting the pacesetter into the backstretch but gave way after a half. JUST A DUKE was settled outside foes to the backstretch, came
under pressure racing into the far turn, was pulled up in distress racing into the stretch and was vanned off the course.

Footnotes
THE STIFLER was urged to gain the lead outside foes racing into the first turn, moved away to a clear advantage entering the backstretch racing a bit off
the rail, dictated terms under pressure through the far turn to the stretch under firm right handed pressure and just held the late challenge of ZITMAN to
prevail. The latter was settled inside foes tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, switched out nearing the far turn splitting rivals steadily gathering
momentum, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a solid late response to just miss. MALIO'S, forwardly placed between foes
racing to the first turn, was rated conceding some position racing into the backstretch tracking the pacesetter outside a rival, was prompted to advance
shifted three wide on the far turn but had no final kick. YABBA DABBA DUDE, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter to the
backstretch, was prompted to make a brief bid racing into the far turn and faded into the stretch. INVASORS WIND settled outside foes dropping off the
second flight to the backstretch and passed between tiring rivals in late stages. OX TROT bobbled at the start, recovered to track off the second flight
outside a rival to the backstretch, angled in on the far turn and steadily faded. BIG MONEY MACHINE hopped at the start, was settled between foes off the
second flight racing to the backstretch but offered no rally. DOX FOLLY was off slowly and failed to menace. RUDIGER angled to the inside early and soon
retreated.

Footnotes
ON A SPREE broke readily to gain a position stalking just off the pacesetter between foes racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady bid to press the
issue nearing upper stretch, then kicked clear and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. SMALL HOPE, forwardly placed three deep tracking just
off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, was prompted to challenge for command in tandem with the winner nearing upper stretch but proved only
second best. KITTEN'S BOY angled in to track off the second flight between foes under rating to the backstretch, split foes just off the inside racing into the
lane and edged rivals for a share. GAMBLER'S FALLACY, reserved off the third flight a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, split foes racing into the
lane while shifting out four deep late but continued with interest to improve position. BURN THE BOATS angled to the inside early tracking just off the
pacesetter, saved ground through the far turn, was prompted to advance along the rail entering the lane but faded late. FLIGHT DECK settled off the third
flight while angling inside early and never gained contention. BARREL OF STOUT, reserved last to the first turn, switched outside foes on the backstretch,
was caught four wide racing through the far turn and lacked a rally. JUAN PABLO tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch but faded
after a half. TETSU, shuffled a bit avoiding close quarters a the start, raced outside foes tracking off the second flight to the backstretch and gave way
racing into the far turn. ERIC THE SALESMAN, urged to the lead while angling to the rail leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far
turn, briefly resisted the winner's challenge nearing upper stretch but gave way racing into the lane.

Footnotes
DRILL'S LI'L MAN was urged to dispute the pace inside foes from the outset shifting a bit off the rail, pressed the issue on a narrow advantage through the
turn, then shook clear in the stretch while being kept to steady pressure. CREDIT CYCLE tracked off the second flight three deep between foes racing
through the backstretch, shifted out four wide on the turn and made steady progress outside foes to late stages to gain the place honors late. C'ERA UNA
VOLTA vied for the lead three deep between foes in the opening stages, angled inwards pressing the pace just outside the winner to upper stretch and
weakened late. MISTER STORM joined the pace four wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue three wide into the turn and weakened in the drive.
STRIKING HEIR tracked the leaders between foes in second flight while angling inwards nearing the turn, shifted out entering the turn while making some
progress three deep between rivals racing into the stretch, was caught in close quarters leaving midstretch and flattened out. EARLY DELIGH, off slowly,
settled outside foes, angled six wide racing into the stretch but made no impression. WELD vied briefly between foes in the first flight, angled to the inside
racing into the turn and soon gave way. UNFLAPPABLE MAX tracked the leaders four wide as part of the second flight in the opening stages, angled
inwards racing into the turn but soon gave way. GRAMMI DANCE was a brief factor inside foes in second flight but faded into the turn. SKY POINT trailed.

Footnotes
CHANNEL STUFFER tracked off the second flight outside a rival under light rating racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance splitting rivals just off
the inside racing into upper stretch making light contact with ASTROTURF but narrowly prevailed between foes under firm handling. U S ARMY CORPS,
gained terms prompting a rival's pace under rating racing to the backstretch, took over after a half, angled to the inside racing into the far turn, held sway to
upper stretch but was collared nearing the wire. ASTROTURF, urged to the lead along the inside racing to the backstretch dictating the pace on a narrow
margin, conceded the advantage after a half to track a rival to the second bend, switched outside that foe while being urged to challenge for command, was
bumped lightly near midstretch while being just outkicked. BEACHWALKER tracked off the second flight under rating along the inside to the far turn, swung
out sharply crossing the path of BLUE SOLO racing four wide into upper stretch but continued to make a mild gain. SMALL TALK tracked off the second
flight outside a rival to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while caught three wide into the far turn, continued in that path between foes to upper
stretch and soon flattened out. STRIKE THE TOP tracked the leaders along the inside as part of the second flight for five furlongs and gave way racing into
the far turn. OUR MAN LUKE settled along the inside as part of the last flight, never gained contention and was gathered up avoiding a fallen rival racing
into the stretch. CAPTAINONTHEROCKS was settled outside a rival in the last flight, never gained contention, then altered course four wide in the stretch
avoiding a fallen rival. BLUE SOLO, reserved near the inside in the opening half, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to
advance, lost his path to BEACHWALKER entering upper stretch while ducking inwards losing his rider, then was walked off the course following the race.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND DISQUALIFIED BEACHWALKER FOR
INTEREFERENCE, PLACING HIM LAST.
