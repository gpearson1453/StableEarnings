Footnotes
P R GOLD MONEY forced the pace outside rivals throughout and slowly edged clear through the lane. ZIBBY TOO was last away, tucked inside to save
ground, rallied up the rail in the lane and gained the place but could not run down the winner. SWEET COWGIRL contested the pace inside rivals and came
up empty in the drive. MISS JUSTICE contested the pace between rivals to upper stretch and weakened. MISS BLUE ROOSTER was just off the leaders
and took up repeatedly while blocked behind rivals in the first turn, remained in reach to to the far turn, swung five wide into the lane but could not threaten
late. BULLS EYE BETTY broke slow and was always back. WILDFIRE SIS lacked a bid racing two and three wide. FANCY ME MARIE was five wide in the
fist turn just off the leaders and tired.

Footnotes
EMMAS SILVER ROSE dueled on the pace outside FASHION FACT throughout and slowly edged clear in the lane. FASHION FACT dueled inside the
winner and could not handle that one late. DREAMINGNDIAMONDS was four and five wide through the turn and offered up a mild late rally.
GONEWITHTHEBREEZE was within reach four wide but lacked a closing bid. SABEBRA within reach three wide, weakened in the drive. BEHOLD DE SKY
was just off the early leaders along the inside and weakened. ADVERSE POSSESSION failed to mount a rally three wide. DANBURITE was six and seven
wide through the turn while always back. BLINKERSONLETHERIP was not a factor. DUBLINTHEMONEY was five and six wide through the turn and never
threatened.

WITTS HURRICANE stalked the pace three or four wide in good position, responded late in the drive and collared CAPTAIN AMANTE on the wire to finish
on even terms. CAPTAIN AMANTE tracked the pace outside WALKER'S BULLET to bid through the far turn, moved clear into the lane then was caught in
the closing jump to finish on even terms with WITTS HURRICANE. TALK BIG MONEY was five wide through the first turn, settled four wide off the leaders
and made a mild run to gain third. WALKER'S BULLET made the pace on a short lead inside CAPTAIN AMANTE to the far turn and weakened in the drive.
ARCH SEEKER stalked the pace in good position three wide and weakened. WILD PAINT saved ground and failed to mount a bid. TAP A MIRACLE was
always back racing three wide. WILD WORLD saved ground while trailing and angled wide in the far turn while never a threat. NOTHARDTOBELIEVE was
five and six wide through the first turn, remained outside and gave way into the far turn and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
ASTONISHING TWEET moved to the front racing along the inside and opened a short clear lead, made all the running and drew off in the lane under
steady handling. RULETHENIGHT moved up three and four wide in the far turn and gained clear for the place but could not threaten the winner. COMO SE
LLAMA tracked the winner's pace from three wide and weakened in the drive. TRASK was three and four wide in reach of the leaders, angled five wide into
the lane could not threaten late. WILLISTON DUDE stalked the pace three wide, angled in on the far turn but failed to mount a bid. CLASSIC CZAR was not
a factor racing four wide. KING OF ANYTHING lunged at the break and was always back. LIL' APOLLO tucked inside going to the first turn, saved ground
and tired. LIL' QUARTER CHUTE saved ground and gave way in the far turn.

Footnotes
AIR ASSAULT settled off the early pace racing four wide, moved four and five wide in the far turn to fan seven wide into the lane and rallied with a good late
run to move clear under steady handling. BIG HEARTED FACTOR followed the pace three or four wide to the far turn, dropped back while fanning six wide
into the lane and rallied late to narrowly gain the place. DIESEL'S PRIZE contested the pace out from the rail while inside rivals to upper stretch and was
worn down in the drive. ELUSIVE BLUEBOY stalked the leaders three wide, angled five wide into the lane and made a mild bid that came up short on the
minor honors. HOT BLOODED SONG contested the pace three and four wide outside rivals and came up empty in the drive. FAT TIRE contested the pace
between rivals and weakened into the lane. DAZZLE MAN settled off the pace four wide, moved up in the far turn but was steadied in traffic nearing the lane
and could not get clear in the drive. MAGIC COWBOY tired racing two and three wide. CRIMSON JET bounced off the rail into the first turn, was taken
outside and gave way after a half.

TEMPER followed the pace four wide, rallied five wide into the lane and narrowly gained the place in the blanket finish. WACCA WACCA WACCA contested
the pace three and four wide, continued willingly in the lane but was outfinished for position late. A J HART contested the pace from between rivals
throughout and weakened late to lose position. CHACE B A LADY was on the pace about the two or three path inside rivals and weakened in the drive.
EUROSADY saved ground and lacked a solid closing bid. JESSICA GLITTERS broke in the air to get away last and was always back racing three wide.
HININI saved ground and weakened.

Footnotes
LET'S GO PLACES saved ground back off the early pace, rallied through the far turn to bid along the rail into the lane, dueled inside INDY N ROSES late
and was just up. INDY N ROSES stalked the pace three wide to bid through the far turn as the field bunched, fanned five wide into the lane and went
gamely to just miss. MAY FLOWERS saved ground back off the early pace, moved up in the far turn and lane but could not threaten the top pair. SHADY
LANE tracked the pace two and three wide to bid through the far turn but could not sustain the run. ORNAMENTAL IRON rallied three wide in the far turn
then checked when running up the heels of the leaders as the field bunched and could not regain the rally. EXTREME CAUTION stalked the pace from four
wide to move into the reach in the far turn but lacked a final closing bid. DEEYA'S BLING was not a threat racing four wide. MAYZEE moved up three and
four wide to bid going up the backstretch, led to late in the far turn and stopped suddenly. JAGGED ARROW showed the most early speed to gain inside
position out from the rail and tired.
