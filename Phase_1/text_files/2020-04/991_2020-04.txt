Footnotes
BEBEAU was forwardly placed around the first turn then stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch, roused forward and took the lead from HAPPY
DANZA near the three eighths pole then widened to a clear advantage, kept under a drive two wide in the final furlong and lasted over rail gaining JOE
BENJAMIN. JOE BENJAMIN tracked in a forward position while saving ground to the far turn, angled out a path and picked up the pace then switched back
to the rail and inched up the inside but could not get to the winner in time. WINNING FACTOR rated along the inside through early stages, was put to a drive
two to three wide upper stretch, bumped with outside running BEACH TRAFFIC then stayed on with response to edge out foe for a share. BEACH TRAFFIC
got bumped at the start, settled through early stages then picked up the pace on the far turn, bumped with WINNING FACTOR while trying to get by foe
near mid-stretch, chased on but lacked the needed response for serious impact. TRACEABILITY angled inside and steadied in opening stages then
remained reserved near the inside, put to a drive six wide into the lane and passed tiring foes. HAPPY DANZA set the pace down the backstretch, got
collared by the winner near the three eighths pole and gave way. CASTILLETE broke out then got bumped into just after the start, raced off the pace and
offered no rally when called upon. BACKANBLEU settled through early stages then failed to move on when roused on the far turn. AVANT GARDE was
reserved through early stages then raced wide into the lane and posed no threat. REINOANIMAUX steadied after the start then raced off the pace, saved
ground on the far turn then offered no late bid. POWER (BRZ) raced off the pace three to two wide and prompted late backstretch but failed to respond.
KATARA PASS bumped a bit at the start, tracked the pace to the far turn then retreated.

Footnotes
DAYS OF SPRING was well positioned and tracked the early pace near the inside, remained forwardly position while patiently on the far turn, angled out
and put to a drive four wide entering the lane, gathered sharp momentum under steady pressure and finished going away. MISS MY MACHO stalked down
the backstretch then advanced three wide on the far turn to take a slim lead, widened to a clear advantage under pressure upper stretch then failed to be a
match when the winner kicked by. LADY NOGUEZ bumped the side of the gate at the start, settled nicely while rated not far off the early pace, hustled up
racing five wide entering top stretch then stayed out with interest and edged out foe for show. BEASAICHI applied pace pressure to VICKYTHEBEST down
the backstretch, vied for the lead around the far turn then gave way in the lane. SAYYIDA AL HURRA rated through early stages, remained patiently
handled on the far turn then swung out six wide entering the lane and failed to rally. VICKYTHEBEST veered out at the start then was quickly to the lead
and angled inside on the first turn, set a pressured pace down the backstretch, vied for the lead around the turn then tired in the drive. BABYBEL saved
ground and rated never too far back, angled out and went to launch a bid top of the lane then ran up into tight quarters and forced to steady, lost all
momentum and dropped back.

FINDING FAME tracked the pace down the backstretch,, launched a two wide bid at the five sixteenths pole, could reach SWEET MIA on the turn but kept
on determinedly through the lane and forged ahead in final stages. SWEET MIA led the way through early stages then briefly came under pressure from
FOUR GRACES, shook off rival and held firm over challenger's around the turn, continued with a clear advantage at the furlong marker then appeared to be
tiring, kept on gamely but could not hold in final stages. MONEY NEVER SLEEPS tracked the pace to the far turn then launched a three wide bid and raced
in striking range, could not get to the leader but never gave up and continued to put in effort to finish well clear for show. FOUR GRACES moved up and
applied pressure to the leader nearing the half mile marker, continued to race in close range to mid-turn then came up empty. FOUR GRANDS raced widest
and settled through early stages then moved up closer near the seven sixteenths pole but could not sustain bid and dropped back. HEIRESSINDY was not
far back in early stages then faded on the turn. SUPER CUTE raced three to four wide and failed to respond. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE showed response in
the opening quarter then dropped back and eased up in the lane.

Footnotes
CRYPTO GOLD settled near inside through early stages then picked up the pace along the inside on the far turn, shifted out and put to a drive five wide top
of the lane, finished willingly and moved away. POSITIVE PHIL stalked down the backstretch then raced two wide in close contention around the far turn,
took over the lead from SMELL OF ROSES near the furlong marker then got outkicked by the winner. DILLON ROCKS rated in good position down the
backstretch, picked up the pace and moved to the inside on the far turn, chased on two wide through the lane and got a head by for show. SMELL OF
ROSES cleared on top nearing the first turn, set the pace down the backstretch and held firm around the far turn, got headed by POSITIVE PHIL near the
furlong marker then gave way. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY stalked along the inside down the backstretch, hustled up but failed to make headway on the far
turn then shifted out and faded. SIR HOSKI raced off the pace and saved ground to no avail. DIRECT APPROACH was reserved in the back and offered no
late bid. SON OF GREATNESS raced three to four wide and had no response when called upon. AT THE BEACH raced in range then faded around the far
