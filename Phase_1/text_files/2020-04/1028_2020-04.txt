steady handling. NOVA LUNA showed good early speed along the inside and was no match for the winner. NANABANANA stalked the early pace, raced
four wide into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. TELL ME BOO BOO stalked the leaders, saved ground throughout and had no late gain.

from the outside, raced four deep at the eighth pole and had no response. NELLE BLUE was off a step slow, raced just off the inside throughout and never
was a factor. ZIPPED was off slowly, saved ground and never threatened. LOST COUNTY was unhurried early, raced four wide at the quarter pole and
never was a factor. WHATA GEM was slow early and never theatened. GOOD EXTREME raced three deep in the lane and never was a factor. GOSPEL

NOCTURNAL MISSION showed good early speed along the inside, built a long lead through the stretch while under steady pressure and was in hand late.
BELLA KRISTINA stalked the pace, raced along the inside in the lane and was no match for the winner. SHAKER BAKER settled off the early pace, raced
towards the inside and had no final bid. LUCIA GAL was allowed to settle, raced seven wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. VEILED IN
GOLD was unhurried early, raced three wide at the quarter pole and had no response. MORO COMPASS broke awkwardly, raced six wide in the stretch
and never was a factor. SIN CITY failed to sustain a bid. SILVER SAILOR pressed the early lead and tired readily.

SANDY SANGRIA pressed the pace, took command through the far turn and held gamely under strong encouragement. KEENA settled off the early pace,
raced four wide at the quarter pole and finished second best. BRIGHT BLING stalked the early leaders, moved up five wide into the lane and kept on to the
wire. BETWEEN THE ARCHES was unhurried early, raced seven wide into the upper stretch and showed good late interest. CASINO QUEEN showed
good early speed and tired. ROYAL SOPRANO dropped back early, raced six deep at the quarter pole and never was a factor. SWEET MARY M pressed
early, raced in tight quarters just past the half mile pole and faded. EUROMANDY failed to respond. LONG RIDE HOME failed to sustain a bid. SERVICE

Footnotes
RED RED WINE showed good early speed and drew off in the drive to be well clear under steady handling. GRAY SKY MESA pressed the pace, raced
three wide in the lane and was no match for the winner. RIGHTEOUS MOVER stalked the pace along the inside and had no final winning bid. OUR LIZZY
LOU was unhurried early, moved up four wide at the quarter pole and had not enough late. SPACE COWGIRL raced towards the inside and had no
response. MISS LEARJET stalked the pace, raced three wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. STARLIGHT TWIST was slow early, improved his
position through the lane while racing four deep and never was a serious threat. DREAMING SILENT stalked the pace, raced four wide at the quarter pole
and weakened. SHERRY BABE dropped back early, raced along the inside into the upper stretch and never threatened. SUNNY'S FUNNY raced five wide
into the upper stretch and never was a factor. GP'S AMAZING GRACE failed to have a response. TAP AND SPIN failed to sustain a bid.
