Footnotes
DEFINITELYDAZZLING moved to the leaders going up the backstretch to bid and move clear through the far turn then was kept to steady urging to widen in
the lane. ATSA WOESY contested the pace inside rivals to the far turn then could not go with the winner while holding well clear for her position. OBVI
contested the early pace three or four wide outside rivals, weakened in the far turn but held position in the drive. SUPER MISS B HAVEN contested the
early lead between rivals and weakened. LAINE'S PEACH moved up four wide while not a threat. TIZASPELL saved ground and weakened. WITT NINE
leaned outward at the break to come away a bit slowly then was not a factor two and three wide. KITTENS EMBRACE broke to the inside and was always
back racing three to four wide. SUPER SILENT gave way racing three wide.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN JOHN settled off the pace racing just off the inside, remained back into the lane, angled out to rally and collared the leaders in the closing jump.
RAISIN CANDY BAR settled off the pace racing three wide, rallied through midstretch then was just caught on the wire by the winner. SLEEPY TURTLE
contested the early pace outside PRINCE OLAF to move clear into the far turn, carried a clear lead to midstretch and was caught in the closing jumps.
PRINCE OLAF contested the pace inside SLEEPY TURTLE to late backstretch, remained in reach but had no closing bid. BLACK ELK stalked the pace
from four wide in reach but lacked a final closing bid. FLASH BROWN was within reach three or four wide but failed to mount a bid. B B'S SCAT'N CAT was
not a threat. PIT FIRE floated out into the first turn and was always outrun.

Footnotes
TREVOR'S FOREVER tracked the early leaders four wide to bid going to the far turn, drew clear nearing the lane then held safe late. S C ANGEL was
along the inside, settled back to follow the pace going up the backstretch then made a mild late rally to close the gap. ONEPRETTYTHING dropped off the
pace racing three and four wide, rallied through the far turn then was up for the show while just missing second. MARK HER PRECIOUS bobbled at the
break but recovered to show in front, saved ground and rallied through the lane but came up short in the blanket finish. ONE LITTLE INDY was on the pace
three wide then lacked the needed late response in the drive. OAKLIE GAL was five and six wide throughout and made a mild late gain. PRETTY KITTY
was five wide through the far turn and could not threaten late. OURS TO HOLD settled in reach of the pace three wide and failed to mount a bid. BILLIE
MAE weakened racing two to three wide. BETTER AND BETTER drifted over heels into the first turn and soon dropped from contention.

Footnotes
YE BE JUDGED reeled in pacesetting LOVESAFLYIN going to the far turn and quickly drew clear, received a brief tap of a righthanded stick into the lane
and drew off the remainder while taken in hand through the closing fifty yards. MR. BIG SHOT saved ground back off the leaders and reeled in the early
leader to gain the place late. LOVESAFLYIN sprinted off to a clear early lead through solid fractions and had nothing left entering the lane. J TRAIN was not
a factor from three wide. YAYASGOTMOREGAME was three and four wide and never threatened. LEON'S DIAMOND trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HESABULLY settled back off the pace while saving ground at the rear, angled out through the far turn to rally three and four wide, collared the leaders
turning for home and drew clear under steady handling. SHIP STALKER was two and three wide early, angled in going to the second turn to save ground
the remainder, rallied but awaited room in behind the leaders nearing the lane then could not get to the winner once clear. COUNT N GOLD contested the
pace inside AMERICAN LEAGUE, went evenly with that one to upper stretch and weakened in the drive. CLASSY COVE settled off the pace two or three
wide, rallied five wide into the lane and missed the show late. AMERICAN LEAGUE contested the pace outside COUNT N GOLD throughout and had
nothing left for the drive. HUNTERS APPEAL stalked the pace in reach two or three wide but failed to mount a bid. JIMBO'S BIZ followed the pace three to
four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
GIANT GAMBLE gained inside position going to the first turn, was joined by SHEPHERD'S PRIDE heading up the backstretch, dueled that one the
remainder and continued game to prevail by the narrowest of margins. GREEN CARD stalked the pace three or four wide, responded when set down to
close outside rivals and just missed the win while finishing on even terms with SHEPHERD'S PRIDE for the place. SHEPHERD'S PRIDE moved up outside
the winner to duel that one up the backstretch and into the lane then just missed at the end while finishing in the dead-heat for place. LONESOME
HIGHWAY tucked inside entering the first turn to stalk in good position, remained in reach but lacked the needed late run. FRANKALEE FUN saved ground
to move up in the far turn but could not threaten late. DORCHEAT ZARB failed to threaten racing three to four wide. COUNTRY CLUB DINER tracked the
early leaders four wide and weakened. BREAK FREE followed the pace three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
SPOTITUDE was content to drop well off the early pace saving ground, angled out through the far turn while angling four and five wide into the lane then
closed with a rush to run down the leaders in the closing yards and move clear. STARLING prompted the pace outside WHERE'S RUFUS throughout,
continued well in the lane but could not contain the winner's late charge. WHERE'S RUFUS was on the pace from along the inside and could not handle the
top in the closing sixteenth. DA VAN GEAUX saved ground in reach of the leaders then continued evenly in the lane and could not threaten late. TEXAS
TROUBADOR failed to mount a bid racing three wide. SONGSTER stalked the pace from three wide and weakened. COUNTRY CURE followed the pace
three wide, angled in on the far turn and had no rally. NATTYTYME was not a factor racing four wide. CHILLY WILLIS tired racing four wide.

Footnotes
BIG GUY IAN was put in tight along the rail into the first turn and bumped as PIERPONT lugged in, remained inside to track the leaders, rallied up the rail in
the lane and was up in the closing jump. KNIGHT DISRUPTOR made the pace on a short lead racing in the two or three path, resisted through the lane and
just failed to last. PIERPONT lugged into to bump with the winner going into the first turn, tracked the leader three or four wide to bid into the far turn but
lacked the needed late rally. RUNAROUNDDANCING followed the pace four and five wide and lacked a solid closing response. THEBOYFROMJERSEY
saved ground back off the early pace, swung out to move five wide into the lane but could not threaten. LEGENDARY LARRY failed to mount a bid racing
four wide. TATAR had a rein break early in the first turn, lost contact and was pulled up in the far turn then walked off with no mishap.

Footnotes
GONE PREACHIN stalked the early pace four wide to bid approaching the far turn, moved clear through that bend and drew off under steady handling.
BORN FORCE dropped off the pace racing four wide, rallied through the far turn to have aim at the winner but could not strides in the drive. SHAWNEE KID
was in reach racing two or three wide, rallied in the lane to gain third but could not threaten the top pair. HEWHOFILLSMYHEART saved ground and lacked
a final closing rally. RAIN RAY settled off the pace racing three wide, swung six wide into the lane and moved up while never a threat. WILLOWY
DANSEUR was taken to the outside into the first turn, went four wide and had no rally. HARMONY GROVE made the pace about the two or three path and
tired. RAZORBACK RED lunged and bumped with a rival at the start and was always back. FANTASTIC WARRIOR bumped with a rival at the start and
tired from three wide. DEMANDS ATTENTION prompted the pace outside HARMONY GROVE to late backstretch and gave way.
