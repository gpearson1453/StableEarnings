Footnotes
SNOW AND LILLYLYNN broke to the lead, rated along inside through an even pace for six furlongs, and remained clear while drifting out late. WONDER
BLONDY took up between horses entering the backstretch, came three wide off the far turn and finished well outside. TERRIBLE TARA broke out in front of
SMARTIZAR, raced in the middle of the field two wide to the stretch, and was up inside BUSINESSINDUBAI to snag the show spot. BUSINESSINDUBAI
prompted the pace outside the winner to the stretch, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. NATIONALIST went four wide around the first turn,
moved in thereafter, and lacked a final response on the rail. FLOWZANO bumped with LOOKN FINE AS WINE at the start, stalked the leaders three wide,
and faded late. LOOKN FINE AS WINE bumped with FLOWZANO at the start, and was no menace three to four wide. SILVER PALMS raced in the second
flight and never threatened. HALFY took an awkward initial step and got bumped by HARMONIC THUNDER, and was outrun four wide. SMARTIZAR
steadied at the start as TERRIBLE TARA broke in front of her, trailed early inside and never became involved. HARMONIC THUNDER broke out bumping
HALFY at the start, and was always outrun. JIMMYS LASS was forwardly placed inside to the far turn, and dropped back under pressure before reaching
the stretch.

Footnotes
GATSBY got outsprinted by GOLDEN PAL early and steadied inside letting that one go, rebid from outside nearing the end of the turn, and proved best
through the late stages. GOLDEN PAL bumped with FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL at the start, dashed clear outside GATSBY leaving the backstretch and moved
inside, got collared by that same opponent turning for home, and yielded grudgingly on the rail. JUST RIGHT MIKE bumped with PEPPI at the start, showed
brief foot between GATSBY and GOLDEN PAL but could not keep pace with them after a sixteenth of a mile or so, felt the whip by late on the turn and ran
on evenly. PEPPI bumped with JUST RIGHT MIKE at the start, came three wide off the turn and could not gain appreciably. FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL
bumped with GOLDEN PAL at the start, and made no headway in the lane on the far outside. HALL RICH LEGACY broke in and was a step slow to begin,
and was outrun. POSEIDONS MYTH lacked early speed and never got close. TESTIFIED showed little at the rear.

Footnotes
LOVE NEST brushed with TAKEDOWN after the start, advanced from midpack after a half-mile, took over readily outside TAKEDOWN and SUMMER
MISCHIEF past the five-sixteenths and widened steadily in hand. DIFFERENTIAL was already under pressure by midway on the turn, and ran along well
enough to be a distant second on the rail. MILLIONAIRE RUNNER raced near the two-path around the turn, and got the show without ever becoming a
factor. MR. CREATIVE raced widest through the stretch getting up for the last major share. TAKEDOWN brushed with LOVE NEST after the start, went up
inside SUMMER MISCHIEF to vie for command leaving the chute, was no match for the winner late on the turn and gave way. SUMMER MISCHIEF vied for
the lead outside TAKEDOWN up the backstretch, gave way late on the turn and dropped far back. BIG BOY BRUNO stumbled at the start, stayed close
early, drifted wide tiring approaching the stretch and was eased up in the late stages.

Footnotes
LA VIEXA steadied along into and around the first turn, began taking closer order after a half-mile toward the inside, shifted out four wide approaching the
stretch, and rallied steadily on the far outside to win going away. GARNER STATE PARK was four wide early, advanced to contention after six furlongs,
rallied to reach the front outside BEE WINGS and A BEAUTIFUL DAY in upper stretch, then could not cope with the winner while moving away from the
others. A BEAUTIFUL DAY saved ground in range early, loomed three wide challenging for command nearing the quarter-pole, and fought on through the
furlong grounds before yielding. BEE WINGS cleared over inside on the first turn, vied up front with PACT up the backstretch, stayed on to upper stretch
and gave way. SPECIAL BEACH was in range for six furlongs, and lacked the needed bid. HERCULINA went along in the middle of the group near the
two-path, and had no rally. PACT was four wide into the first turn, argued the pace outside BEE WINGS through the middle stages, and faded after six
furlongs. ZANDREA'S raced four wide and faded before reaching the stretch. BOATLOADOFNERVE hit the left side of the gate and spotted the field a
couple lengths, and was never close. JANE was three wide early and always outrun. FELONY MELANIE was four wide early, dropped well back after six
furlongs and was vanned off after the finish. FAST FRACTION bore out around the far turn, was pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
POLISHED COPPER saved ground well back for six furlongs, hunted for room cutting the corner into the lane, shifted to the three-path in front of PHILLY
SPECIAL in deep stretch, and got up even as the rider fumbled with the whip switching to the right hand. CHOUCHOU DE BOO set the pace through an
even clip, responded well through the lane and led to the closing yards. LAKE PARIMA was never far back, had aim through the drive and finished well
enough to get up for the show. MARIES MELODY stalked the leaders, bid outside at the top of the stretch, and flattened out late. PHILLY SPECIAL saved
ground for six furlongs, could not gain between horses through the furlong grounds, and checked late as the winner came out in front of her. SHOW MAID
shifted four wide approaching the stretch, and could not seriously threaten. MILLEFIORI saved ground early, and was never a factor. GRAVEL GERTIE
gained mildly through the middle stages, but could not sustain the bid. JOSEFA pressed the pace outside CHOUCHOU DE BOO to the far turn, and tired.
SEA ANNA DREAM became keyed up early and was taken to the far outside approaching the backstretch, and was finished by the far turn. ANGLICO lost
contact with the field early, and showed nothing.

Footnotes
MIHOS broke near the lead then settled back to track rivals in the opening quarter, roused forward three wide around the turn, took over the lead entering
top stretch and kept clear under a driving finish. SNIPER SHOT broke inward and bumped with foe at the start, was forwardly placed and remained in
steady pursuit behind the leader around the turn, tipped out wider for the drive and stayed on with response to clear second best. ROYAL SQUEEZE sped
to a slim lead then cleared on top and angled inside, continued to lead the way into the turn then got collared by the winner turning for home and gave way.
DO SHARE took a solid bump at the start, angled inside then shifted out and hustled up around the turn, pushed on five wide entering the lane and lacked
the needed response for late impact. HY RIVERSIDE raced in the back, saved ground into stretch run and lacked a needed rally. GLORY OF FLORIDA got
bumped at the start, raced near the rear and driven three wide around the turn but could not reach threatening range. CREATE AGAIN raced up close
through early stages then steadily faded.

OHANZEE broke well, gained the lead and angled inside, held firm around the turn, came off the inside and dug in under strong right handed pressure,
drifted a couple paths wider, made contact with gaining SOVEREIGN WARRIOR deep stretch and just lasted. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR vied for the lead in
opening stages then raced just off OHANZEE and steadied near the three eighths pole, kept on determinedly along the outside in stretch run, reached the
outside of the winner deep stretch then got brushed and just missed. SOUPER SHENANIGAN hustled along from the get go and raced in contention around
the turn then continued a steady four to five wide bid through the lane. WILD ONE FOREVER raced in contention along the inside, saved ground into stretch
then flattened in the final furlong. BEINFUN raced three deep under pressure entering the turn then failed to rally in the lane. NEVERSTOPDREAMING
raced two to three wide not too far back through early stages then had no late response. FENTYNOLA lacked early foot and offered no late bid.

Footnotes
POSEIDON'S PASSION set a pressured pace on top then drew clear upper stretch, continued clear under a drive along the inside then just lasted over
surging SHIPPY. SHIPPY raced in range between foes then waited briefly at the quarter pole, roused two at the eighth pole then kicked in gamely deep
stretch, surged to the wire and got denied by a nose. ENVIED was patiently handled inside to two wide around the turn, was put to a drive five wide upper
stretch and gained in the final furlong. SILVER TUNES pressed the pace two wide around the turn, stayed on three deep near the furlong marker then gave
way. FREE THE BEAST saved ground briefly then angled out leaving the turn, raced wide upper stretch and had a mild improve. JUST SMOK'N chased the
pace along the inside then weakened in the lane. NOTORIOUS R B G got bumped at the start then circled up into contention around the turn then gave way
in the final furlong. STILL ALIVE broke out and bumped with rival at the start, chased three wide around the turn then weakened. MRS. MAISEL raced three
to four wide and lacked a needed rally. RANDIABBY was off a step slow at the start and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
MI TRES POR CIENTO (CHI) tracked the leader in the opening quarter, advanced under mild prompting and cleared the lead mid-way on the turn then
widened to clear advantage and kept to task in late stages. FORTIN HILL broke out and bumped with rivals at the start, chase along the inside into the lane,
was solid in response but was no match for the winner. RUNNING FOR RIZ sprinted to a clear lead then got collared by the winner past the three eighths
pole, drifted out wider in the lane and ran on for share. WHYRUAWESOME bumped with foe at the start then chased the top trio around the turn then raced
wide and evenly through the lane. VINNIE VAN GO steadily advanced on the leader, raced in aim near the three eighths pole then flattened shortly after and
gave way in the lane. YODEL E. A. WHO stumbled hard at the start and lost ground, shifted out wide in stretch run and lacked a needed rally.
BENEFACTOR got bumped at the start and raced off the early speed, was ridden along five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. SHAKHIMAT got
bumped repeatedly between foes at the start and had no response.

Footnotes
COWTOWN was unhurried then picked up the pace along the inside leaving the backstretch, took closer order then steadied near the quarter pole, angled
out and hustled up leaving the final turn then stumbled upper stretch but stayed on gamely, got clear three deep, roused to the top in late stages and held
firmly. CHOCOLATE BAR was reserved down the backstretch and remained near the inside into the far turn, shifted out and put to a drive five top wide top
of the lane, responded and advanced to race in aim but could not get by the game winner. RECONVENE saved ground and rated off the clear leader
through early stages, advanced and took over the lead mid-way on the far turn, continued clear in the final furlong then failed to hold off the late gaining duo.
EAGLES PALACE rated off the early pace then hustled up late backstretch, steadied between foes mid-way around the final turn then chased on into the
final furlong and finished evenly. MAVERICK KITTEN settled through early stages then advanced three wide between foes near the quarter pole, brushed
with PORT HUNTER late on the far turn, chased on along the inside at the eighth pole then gave way. BOURBON WISDOM raced off the pace then circled
up closer around the far turn, continued in close range to mid-stretch then came up empty. MAGIC STREET raced five wide entering the first turn, hustled
along racing four deep entering the far turn, got carried out wider entering the lane and gave way. YOUCANTCATCHCURLIN dropped back after the
opening quarter and remained reserved, saved ground around the far turn then shifted out upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. PORT HUNTER picked
up the pace near the inside, advanced two wide to race in contention at the quarter pole then got jostled late on the far turn and weakened. ALPHA DOG
was forced to check sharply to avoid tiring foe near the quarter pole then lacked further response. KING OF ROCK opened up to a clear advantage on the
first turn, set a quick pace down the backstretch, got collared mid-turn then got bumped back while tiring. CONFORMITY was the closest pursuer of the
quick pacesetter then retreated on the final turn.
