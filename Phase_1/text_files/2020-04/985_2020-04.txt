NAME THE PRICE moved up outside the early leaders to bid clear from four wide going up the backstretch, widened in the far turn then was kept to task to
about midstretch before taken in hand late. YE BE JUDGED forced the early pace outside CREEDS REVENGE, continued to follow the winner through the
far turn but could not match strides. CREEDS REVENGE gained the early lead racing out from the rail then could not go with the top pair through the final
quarter. ALEX TO failed to mount a rally four wide. STEF'S GUY steadied into the first turn when appearing to get out a bit, chased the leaders from three
wide and weakened. EL PRIETO chased the early pace, gave way going to the far turn and was eased under the wire.

Footnotes
THIRD DIMENSION stalked the pace from three wide to reel in JOMO nearing the lane while moving inside that one, came out a bit to appear to brush with
that one midstretch and moved clear late. JOMO was on the pace outside WITTS SHORT STOP early to move well clear into the far turn while out about
the three or four path, came in to appear to brush with the winner midstretch and could not go with that one while clearly best of the others. The rider of
JOMO lodged a claim of foul against the winner alleging interference in the stretch run which was not allowed. CAPTAIN JOHN saved ground and could
only best the others. SHATTERED DREAMS moved up three wide while not a threat. CLASSY MAGIC hesitated at the break, trailed early while four wide
and improved position while no threat. LET IT RIP saved ground and was not a threat. VONSTER chased the early pace three or four wide and tired. WILD
WORLD lunged at the break then was four to six wide through the first turn and tired. WITTS SHORT STOP showed speed from three path to midway up
the backstretch and gave way.

WITT'S GOLD was along the inside to bid into the lane and continued well to be slowly edging clear late. MERLO'S LAD challenged three and four wide
outside the winner into the lane and could not handle that one late. MAXIMUS THE GREAT was back off the leaders four wide and closed but was too late.
CONTRABAND broke in the air then rushed up four wide to challenge through the turn but could not sustain the move into the lane. HYPERBOLIZER
showed the most early speed to gain a clear lead in the opening quarter but had little left in the drive. ALL FOR TRUTH saved ground and lacked a rally.
GRAND HOGA saved ground and trailed.

Footnotes
SENATOR ROBERT stalked the dueling leaders three or four wide to midway of the far turn, angled in nearing the lane to split foes turning for home and
went well to wear down EMPIRICAL DATA through the lane. EMPIRICAL DATA dueled on the pace outside BITSY'S CARLOS to the far turn, edged clear
nearing the lane then could not hold the winner safe late. ELUSIVE BLUEBOY saved ground midpack to the far turn, angled three wide into the lane and
made a mild bid to gain the show. WILLOWY DANSEUR settled off the pace racing four wide, fanned six wide into the lane and just missed third. SERGIOS
LIMONCELLO was in reach racing three wide but lacked a final closing run. LIL' APOLLO was not a threat racing four wide. RISKY BOY was always back.
BITSY'S CARLOS dueled on the pace inside EMPIRICAL DATA to the far turn and gave way through that bend.

WITT LOVES TACOS was on the pace inside rivals to edge clear in the second turn, continued on a daylight lead the remainder and held the margin in the
lane under steady handling. BIG EGYPT tucked inside through the first turn to save ground, made a bold move to striking distance heading up the
backstretch then could not get to the winner in the drive. SPUNKY KITTEN tracked the pace outside the winner to the far turn and came up empty nearing
the lane while well clear of the others. WISE RON was with the lead group while five wide through the first turn, moved inside going to the second turn and
remained in reach to the final turn before tiring. BOSQUE COUNTY was with the lead group while three or four wide for a half and tired. MUMFORD was six
and seven wide through the first turn, remained in reach to the final turn and tired. TEKELA'S GLORY was six wide through the first turn and never
threatened. MR. PARK was with the leaders early four wide, gave way going up the backstretch and was eased to the wire.

RETALIATED gained a short lead racing about the two or three path and made the running to late in the far turn, shook off bids from both sides nearing the
lane and moved clear again late. DJINN OF DJIBOUTI tracked the pace outside the winner to bid into the lane then could not go with that one late while
holding the place. MINGO BORN tracked the pace inside, bid into the lane inside the winner then continued on to narrowly miss the place. EASTSIDE BOY
lunged at the break to get away last, stalked the leaders three wide and lacked a final closing bid. MASCARPONE was not a threat racing four wide. ROLL
OUT stalked the pace four wide to the far turn and weakened.

FIANNA HILLS was on the pace outside JOY FOREVER early, was joined by FRIGID to her outside and WITT SEVEN to her inside leaving the second
turn, continued from between rivals through the far turn and kept on gamely to move clear late. WITT SEVEN tracked the pace from along the inside, bid
inside the winner turning into the backstretch, continued to upper stretch and could not go with that one late. FRIGID moved up four wide to bid outside the
top pair leaving the second turn, continued as a trio up the backstretch and through the far turn then came up empty in the drive. LOST KEY moved up three
wide in the far turn but could not threaten in the lane. TERRI'S TEMPER followed the pace three or four wide to the far turn and weakened. TOCCETTA
passed only tired ones. EUROSADY stalked the early pace four wide, gave way in the far turn and was eased under the wire. JOY FOREVER contested the
early pace out from the rail, gave way suddenly approaching a half mile and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
RENVYLE settled back off the pace racing three wide, rallied through the far turn then responded when set down in the lane to run down TRAPPER PEAK
in the closing yards. TRAPPER PEAK tracked the early leader along the inside to challenge into the second turn, kicked well clear heading up the
backstretch, brought a daylight lead into the lane but could not hold the winner safe. SUPERSTYLE saved ground in reach of the pace then went evenly in
the lane to hold third. LIGHTNING MONKEY stalked the pace from four wide and lacked a final closing run. MEDIEVAL MEDICINE dropped back off the
pace four wide, moved up six wide into the lane but could not threaten. MAYHAWK followed the pace three or four wide and weakened. WILLISTON DUDE
followed the pace three wide and tired. ASTONISHING TWEET moved to a clear early lead out about the three or four path then gave way in the far turn.
