Footnotes
BOO BE RIGHT close from the start off the inside, bid entering the stretch, took over, shook well clear, held late. RICH ICON settled off the pace in the two
path and under restraint, asked into the turn, dropped to the rail late in the bend, steered back out when straightened for home, finished up willingly to be
getting to the winner late. JAMES'S MOONSHINE off a step slow, steered out to be three wide when advancing late in the turn, chased the winner past the
furlong marker then flattened out a bit late to lose the place. JESSE JONES raced in mid pack off the inside, angled in a bit to race in the two path through
the turn, improved slightly while not a serious threat to the top three late. ROCK CITY ROCKET restless gate, forwardly placed while four wide through the
turn, tired in the drive. RISKY SITUATION lacked speed toward the inside, came in to tighten up HALE'S ANGEL with a furlong remaining causing that foe
to check, improved slightly to the wire. GRAHAMSTAN off a step slow, four wide through the turn, improved slightly by passing mostly tiring rivals.
SUMMERTIMER fractious in the gate, failed to menace while racing three wide. HALE'S ANGEL off slowly, raced back while saving ground,continued to
race along the inside into the stretch, put in tight, checked up with a furlong remaining, did not recover. OFFICER DONELL broke alertly, set the pace for a
half inside, gave way when headed. EXPLOSIVE SHOES pressed the issue for four furlongs three wide and also faltered in the drive. MY SUGAR TOWN
finished early while along the inside.

Footnotes
MY BOY LOLLIPOP behind the pace off the inside, tilted out to be three wide into the land, split foes, drove well clear. YOUNG HENDRICK with the pace
along the inside, continued to show the way into the lane, offered little resistance to the winner past the furlong to prove no match for that one, lasted for the
place. TIZ MCNAMARA with the main body outside, came three wide when roused of the the turn, improved position, getting to the runner up late. JIMMY
AT LAST within striking distance along the inside, remained forwardly placed past the furlong marker, came up empty late. CAMPAIGN SPY void of speed
off the inside, five wide when advancing turning for home, failed to sustain that advance the final furlong. P C SUSPECT prompted the pace outside, four
wide through the turn, had little left for the drive. LATE ACT JONES vied up front while between foes into and through the turn, gave way in the drive. G. C.
CRACKERJACK dwelt at the start, raced well back early, saved ground turn, improved in the drive by passing mostly tiring rivals. LEO DEL REO with the
pace while three wide, faltered in the drive. IN THE DEEP four wide throughout, made little impact. SHOAL BAY remained always back. GRAFFITO steadily
faded.

Footnotes
SWISS MINISTER away alertly, prompted the leader to that one's outside, continued to press the issue through the turn, moved to challenge turning for
home, came in to bump with the runner up soon after despite left handed urging, drove clear late. LEWYS VAPORIZER broke in good order, showed the
way up the backstretch and into the turn, responded width the winner came alongside entering the stretch, dueled pace the furlong grounds while in close
quarters, bumped, could not match strides late, clearly second best. GUSKA MON SHOES in mid pack along the inside, roused while continuing to save
ground late in the turn, rallied for the show, no match for the top two. DOC CURLIN lacked early foot, angled out to be four wide exiting the turn, finished
willingly well out in the strip while too late. BIG LEAGUE within striking distance while along the inside, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing
kick. BROADWAY ICE improved position without posing a serious threat. TRES EQUIS off slowly, trailed early, four wide out of the turn, improved with
some belated interest out in the strip. FIVE O ONE within striking distance just off the inside, had little left for the drive. ROARING RULE void of early foot
inside, saved ground to no avail. AIR POWER four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. MOST MISCHIEF one paced in the three path, gave way
in the drive. MEETME AT D'STREET steadily faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL
BY THE RIDER OF LEWYS VAPORIZER AGAINST THE WINNER, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

finished up willingly late to be up for the place. GARDEN AFFAIR forwardly placed while racing three wide, continued to stalk the middle half, lacked a
winning response in the drive, caught late for the place. SENSE YOU LEFT went one paced throughout while saving ground most of the way. MALIBU
MARLEE went one paced while racing in midpack. FLASHY BIZ void of speed off the inside, raced kin the two path through most of the final turn, moved out
for the drive, improved position with some belated interest. HASHTAG WINNER settled off the pace, fell back after a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals
after the issue had been decided. HONORABLE MEMORY pressured the winner from the outside, faltered in the drive. PRETTI XTREME failed to menace
while racing three wide. KIZZY B off a step slow, remained always back. IRISH INTUITION tired while racing off the inside and finished far back.

Footnotes
FROST OR FRIPPERY settled off the pace and the inside, advanced into contention while three wide through the final turn, bid into the stretch, drew clear
under steady handling. PARADE FIELD unhurried early, began a steady advance after a half, steered out to be four wide late in the final turn, rallied for the
place not a threat to the winner. MATROOH pressed into the first turn, took over and got briefly clear after a half, showed the way through the turn and into
the stretch, gave way faltered when headed by the winner with less that a furlong remaining. PINSON set the early pace in the two path through the first
turn, relinquished the advantage before four furlongs, chased, weakened in the drive. HE'S SO ZAZZY in some traffic into the first turn, raced back, moved
out to be four wide again late in the final bend, improved position. UCANTHANKMELATER off slow, trailed inside, displayed some mild interest to improve
into the lane then flattened out. FRONT DOOR three out to four wide when off the pace in the first turn, in the second flight in the run up the backstretch,
came up empty for the drive. EIGHTS AND ACES within striking distance for a half, began to fade and had nothing left for the drive. ON PATROL five wide

Footnotes
LIONITE unhurried for a half while three wide, swung four wide into the lane, roused, finished full of run to win going away. SCORING broke on top,
prompted the early leader off the inside, ranged up to challenge turning for home, took command just outside the furlong ground, led late, proved no match
for the winner in the waning strides. PETROV within striking distance in the two path, came three wide out of the turn, roused, finished willingly to be up late
for the show. DEFLATER broke in good order, set the pace along the inside until just over a furlong remained, faltered. C Z ROCKET off a step slow, failed
to menace toward rail. AGGRESSIVITY off a step slow, trailed early, angled out to be four wide exiting the turn, picked off some tiring rivals. THE RED
DUDE asked early along the inside to race forwardly, began to fade before a half. COWBOY COOL remained always back while racing four wide. VICTORY
ELEMENT within striking distance while racing outside, closer three wide midway on the turn, gave way when the real running began at the head of the
lane.

Footnotes
THE GREAT DANSKY never far back off the inside, challenged the leader turning for home, drove clear nearing midstretch, held the runner up comfortably
safe late. SACRED OATH in some traffic early, well out in the strip, four out to five wide early in the turn, six wide into the stretch, finished willingly down the
middle of the strip to be slowly getting to the winner while clear of the others. KNIGHT COMMANDER void of early foot after being pushed out at the start,
two path through the turn, also displayed some late interest to be up for the show. SECRET BISCUIT settled behind the pace inside, moved out a bit late in
the turn, closest to the winner a furlong out, weakened to finish up evenly and lose a couple of positions. FLASH OF SILVER broke out, raced in the two
path into and through the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, came up empty for the drive. SHACKLEFORD'S JOY in mid pack and three wide through the
turn, continued one paced through the lane in lacking a closing kick. THE BIG BLUFF last away, void of speed, improved position while never a serious
threat. GUM TREE LANE bothered early, picked up and moved out, four wide turn, passed tiring rivals while not a serious threat. REELFOOT tired while
racing off the inside. POLLY'S BROTHER in mid pack early outside, four wide late in the turn, failed to muster a closing response. RULING broke alertly,
sprinted clear, showed the way for four furlongs then faltered when headed by the winner entering the stretch. FLIGHT BOSS bothered at the start, finished
early, trailed home in showing little.

Footnotes
HORSE DOCTOR in the second flight toward the inside, two path and in some traffic turn, moved to challenge from between foes nearing midstretch, was
bumped, forced in when UNION RIDE came in nearing the furlong grounds, bumped with a tiring I'M BUSY immediately after, brushed with the former rival
repeatedly to the wire, dug in late to gamely prevail. MARVIN within striking distance outside, four wide through the turn, bid when straightened for home,
long drive, missed. UNION RIDE in the second flight while off the inside, three wide through the turn, waited when lacking room late in the turn, continued to
race in traffic upper stretch, came in, bumped foe, brushed repeatedly, outkicked in the late going while remaining between rivals. AMERICAN MANDATE
broke sharp, closest to the pace in the two path, challenged in the turn, long drive while surrounded to the wire, yielded late. BOX OF CHOCOLATES broke
back, lacked speed, worked way out to the four path late turn, finished willingly while too late and widest down the lane. EDGEMONT ROAD forwardly
placed while three wide, continued prominent until past the furlong and weakened. BREAKING NEWS in mid pack outside, four wide through most of the
turn, lacked a closing punch. HOLLYWOOD STAR off a couple of steps slow, raced back, failed to menace. I'M BUSY away in good order, showed the way
inside, continued to vie when challenged late in the turn, appeared to be beginning to tire when put in tight then was forced to check up with a furlong
remaining, continued to falter to the wire. CREME DE CERISE broke back and was never involved well off the inside. HAYDENS HAVOC well wide while
outside early, four wide through the turn, tired in the drive. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, UNION RIDE WAS
DISQUALIFIED FOR INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH AND PLACED NINTH.
