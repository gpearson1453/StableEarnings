Footnotes
COMMUNICADO was slow early, moved up seven wide into the lane and finished well to get up late under strong handling. BAYTOWN BABE was
unhurried early, moved up four wide through the lane and finished second best. BLING SPRINGSTEEN stalked the early pace, moved up three wide
through the stretch, was well clear and weakened in the latter stages. REWARDED stalked the early pace, raced three wide around the far turn through the
lane and had no final winning bid. SHESGOTHISTOUCH showed good speed from the inside and gave way. KOTTONCANDY KISSES settled off the early
pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no rally. DARLING KINNA was allowed to settle early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was
a factor. SPECIAL SKY failed to sustain a bid. ALL THE JUICE failed to menace.

INDIAN CROSS stalked the early pace, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and finished well to be clear late under strong handling. BERNARDIAN
pressed the early pace, led in the upper stretch while racing off the inside and finished second best. MY MACHO MON was allowed to settle early, moved
up along the inside and finished willingly in the latter stages. DE BIRD IS DA WORD stalked the pace, raced evenly and had no rally. MEN OF KYLE settled
off the early going, raced towards the inside and had no response. TALK GRUFF was slow early, raced three deep in the stretch and never was a factor.
SECOND GUESS saved ground and never threatened. RUDY'S BOY showed good early speed from the outside and tired readily.

Footnotes
RIDE TO THE WIRE set all the pace, drifted late and held gamely to remain clear under strong handling. BRING THE DOUGH was allowed to settle early,
moved up three wide through the lane and finished second best. CALLME MR MISTER was unhurried early, moved up seven wide into the upper stretch
and made a good late gain. THE DEVIL'S DADDY was off very slow, moved up four wide through the stretch and showed good late interest. FORTNITE
DANCE settled off the early pace, raced six wide through the lane had not enough in the drive. COCONUT ICE stalked the pace, raced five wide into the
upper stretch and never was a factor. HOT FUDGE LOUIE pressed the pace and faded. ARTIES EMBLEM failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
BELLE STRIKE stalked the pace, gained command in the stretch, raced three wide at the eighth pole and held gamely under strong pressure. MADISON'S
WILD ONE was slow early, raced along the inside nearing the quarter pole into the lane, angled three wide in the stretch and found his best stride late to
close belatedly. CINNAFRIJOLE showed good speed along the inside and weakened a bit in the latter stages. QUEEN OF ALVA pressed the pace, raced
between rivals into the lane, raced four wide and weakened late. TOCDIRTYTOME was allowed to settle, raced three wide into the lane and had no late
rally. BAYTOWN VI VI stalked the pace along the inside and tired. COMBINE ROAD was unhurried early and failed to respond. CLASSICAL HOTTIE
showed little.
