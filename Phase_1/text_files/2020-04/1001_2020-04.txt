TOFFEN raced between foes a bit tight on the first turn then rated two to three wide down the backstretch, was ridden along through the far turn then rallied
along the outside in the lane and ran down the leader deep stretch. BY HIS GRACE set the pace along the rail down the backstretch then turned away bid's
around the far turn, stayed game into the lane then got outkicked deep stretch. SUNDAY SCHEMING raced five wide heading into the first turn, tracked the
pace to the far turn then launched a three wide bid, remained forwardly placed upper stretch then lacked strong closing response. TOKYO was unhurried
and saved ground into stretch, angled out three to four wide and steadily gained in the final furlong. INEDATEQUILA steadied after the start then remained
reserved in the back saving ground, swung out six wide entering the lane and gained position. COUPLE OF NIKKIS stumbled at the start and recovered
quickly to be forwardly placed on the first turn, stalked along the inside to the far turn then failed to kick on under pressure. GRIMPANTE raced off the pace
then wide in the stretch and passed tiring foes. MALIBU TOO rated along the outside down the backstretch then lacked the needed response when called
upon on the far turn. DONA CAMILE settled long the inside to the far turn then made no headway under pressure on the far turn. INTO FANCY stalked the
pace down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid on the far turn then faded in the lane. MARIANNA QUEEN was reserved near the back, raced two wide
into stretch and lacked a needed rally. SUBTLE JOY raced off the pace then hustled along five wide into the lane and offered no late bid.

advanced between foes to be forwardly placed, raced two wide in aim on the turn, could not get to the sharp winner but stayed on with good response for
second best. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA raced up close in then opening quarter and continued three wide in aim on the turn, hustled along three to four wide
into the lane, got carried a couple paths wider and just lasted for show. STRATEGIC OUTLOOK raced inside behind the top flight at the half, hustled up
along the rail on the turn then shifted out five wide in the lane and just missed gaining show. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN) got pinballed between rivals at the
start, raced off the pace then shifted inside top of the lane and failed to rally. SAINT LARNED raced near the inside early on then roused five to six wide into
the lane but had no response. BEAU TRACE backend took a solid bump at the start then raced off the pace along the outside and failed to kick on under
pressure. LONDON WEREWOLF raced wide throughout and failed to mount a serious challenge. HOLLYWOOD OVERDOGS raced in range early on and
continued in contention four wide around the turn then gave way. SIGHTED chased in a forward position through early stages then weakened around the
turn. DON FAGER raced three to four wide and never reached contention.

Footnotes
WHISKEY SUNRISE was forwardly placed under slight restraint in opening stages, let out a notch and took over the lead at the three eighths pole, widened
to a clear advantage in hand then raced under steady pressure along the inside through the lane and remained well clear. VICTORY TOWN raced off the
clear top trio in the backstretch then moved up closer along the outside around the turn, was set down four to five wide in the drive, produced a solid bid but
was no match for the clear winner. CHINOMADITO raced along the outside off the early pace then roused five to six wide in the lane and churned on for a
share. HALO'S DANCE got bumped sideways at the start losing all momentum, saved ground then angled and put to pressure but had no response.
BAHAMIAN BEAT sped to the lead out of the gate, got collared by the winner near the three eighths pole then steadily faded. TORTOLA PRIDE chase up
close through early stages then retreated in the lane. INTEND got bumped hard then drifted out wide at the start and had no response.

Footnotes
SARATOGA AFFAIR was allowed to settle in the opening quarter then angled out and prompted to head in pursuit, hustled up along the outside around the
turn then rallied five to six wide through the lane and finished clear. NIKKI AND PAPA was reserved in the opening quarter then roused along the inside
around the turn, advanced into contention then continued an inside bid and inched up to capture place. GUAZZA was the closest pursuer of the clear top
pair in early stages and hustled along in steady pursuit, continued a three to four wide bid racing in close contention at the sixteenth pole then lacked closing
kick. BERNIE'S MISTRESS hooked up with PILOT EPISODE out of the gate and vied for the lead while racing clear over the next pursuer, shook free on
the turn and kept clear at the furlong marker then got wore down deep stretch. SIXTH STREET angled inside in opening stages, picked up the pace and
angled out on the turn, was set down five to six wide in the lane and ran on evenly in the final furlong. SNICKET raced off the pace then widest in the stretch
run and failed to mount a serious challenge. PILOT EPISODE hooked up with BERNIE'S MISTRESS in opening stages and vied for the early lead, could not
match strides but remained up close through the turn then tired in the drive. LIGHT UP NIGHT had no response.

Footnotes
MYLASTFIRSTKISS vied for the lead racing outside of RISK MODEL down the backstretch, shook free to a slim lead near the quarter pole, found more
under pressure, widened to a clear advantage and stayed sharp. PRAIRIE WINGS tracked the pace along the inside and continued in range still unleashed
at the quarter pole, had to wait for a clear path upper stretch then tipped out and put to a drive at the eighth pole, responded and got up for place. PRIMACY
stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced between foes and launched a bid on the far turn, sustained a bid with response in the final furlong then got
edged late for place. RISK MODEL vied for the lead with the winner down the backstretch, could not match strides with rival at the quarter pole but chased
on in a forward position into stretch then faded in the final sixteenth. JEWELED PRINCESS steadily advanced closer and raced three wide in close
contention on the turn, continued a bid in range to the eighth pole then weakened. PRETTY DARLING raced two to three wide and failed to move into
contention. LOADED was not too far back at the half then had no response when called upon. NATURELL (ECU) raced off the pace along the outside and
had no response. SEQUAYA had no response and distanced in the lane.

Footnotes
KAREN'S COVE raced in range then began to edge up closer on the leader near the quarter pole, given cue turning for home and raced wide into the lane,
dug in under steady pressure and edged away. RAY'SWARRIOR held a slim lead at the half then widened advantage and held firm around the turn, came
out wider turning for home then got collared in late stages but stayed on stubbornly. COMBINATION raced along the rail in early stages, tipped a path wider
and hustled up at the quarter pole, sustained a two wide bid into the lane, advanced into contention and continued a solid bid for a share. DR HARLAN
settled in early stages then prompted four wide around the turn, raced wide entering top stretch, showed interest but needed more for impact. DESERT
GENERAL was forwardly placed in the quarter then failed to make headway around the turn and offered no late bid. BLACK PEPPER was off slow at the
start, remained reserved and wide without moving into contention. PANGO was off to a good start then dropped back early and had no response under
pressure. SMOKE 'N' GLOAT chased in close range along the inside through early stages then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
DYN set a pressured pace down the backstretch, moved away and held clear around the far turn, widened advantage to clear command at the eighth pole
then began to tire in late stages, dug in for more and had enough in reserve to hold clear. BUDGET BUSTER stalked the pace to the far turn then launched
a bid for command, moved out wider for the drive, kept on determinedly through the lane but could not get to DYN in time. SIR CHUBBY pressed the pace
down the backstretch and continued in close range around the far turn then sustained a steady two to three wide bid in the lane. SKYRAY was unhurried
then roused around the far turn, race five wide into the lane and had a mild improve. BOSS LIFE rated off the pace then prompted two wide on the far turn
then ran on evenly in the lane. SEE THE PYRAMIDS was unhurried and saved ground through early stages, angled and put to pressure entering the lane
and passed tiring foes. LE COSTE raced near midpack and failed to kick on under pressure. SOLE SEEKER raced off the pace, saved ground and lacked a
needed rally. LOVEDISC raced wide into the lane and failed to move into contention. SALVADUCCI tracked the pace along the inside down the backstretch,
chased on around the turn then faded.

Footnotes
CORY GAL broke on top, quickly cleared and crossed over to the inside, held firm around the turn, saved ground and put to pressure entering the lane,
responded sharply and pulled away. ROYAL MEGHAN was forwardly placed and hustled along three wide around the turn, sustained a steady bid through
the lane, was solid in response but was no match for the winner. PROSPECTIVE DIVA raced near the rear and saved ground, angled out and put to
pressure around the turn, stayed on four to five wide in the final furlong and finished with response to capture show. HOW SWEEP IT IS raced off the top
trio around the turn, ran on three to four wide in stretch run and got edged out late for a share. MERSEYSIDE was forwardly placed and chased after the
leader around the turn then tired in the drive. SHES ALL WOMAN raced along the outside and failed to rally under pressure. BLUE BLUE ICE raced along
the outside and had no response. BION MAGIC saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
ZIPPY was nicely rated near the inside down the backstretch, prompted to pick up the pace around the far turn, was set down driving five wide in the lane,
steadily gained closer contention then dug in determinedly and got up late. SOUPER COURAGE tracked the pace to the far turn, moved up closer and
raced three wide in aim at the quarter pole, took over the lead entering top stretch, continued to hold firm under pressure then got edged out late. DEVOTED
KITTEN raced off the pace and saved ground near the inside, was under strong left handed urging leaving the far turn, shifted out wider top of the lane and
gained late. GINS AND TINS secured inside position around the first turn, tracked the pace down the backstretch, angled out leaving the far turn, roused
forward to race in range in the final sixteenth then wrapped up in final strides and lost show. REDOUTE'S LIGHT was reserved down the backstretch and
continued in the rear on the far turn, raced wide under steady urging through the lane and improved late. MACHIAVELLI rated off the early pace then
hustled along two wide around the turn, raced three to four wide in range in the final sixteenth then finished evenly. BRASSTOWN set the pace down the
backstretch, came under pressure late in the far turn then lost the lead to SOUPER COURAGE top stretch, ran on to the final sixteenth then gave way.
BOLD PAYNTER rated off the early pace, prompted around the far turn then raced wide in the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. SIR
SEAMUS stalked down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid on the far turn then gave way in the lane. SPEED GRACER settled early on and saved
ground around the far turn, cut the corner entering top stretch and lacked a needed rally.

Footnotes
BLAZING DESIRE sped to the lead and crossed over to the inside on the first turn, set the pace down the backstretch then challenged by GRAN HOMBRE
near the quarter pole, continued to battle on along the inside through the lane, kept a head in front and refused to let rival get by. GRAN HOMBRE was
positioned as a sharp factor and stalked behind BLAZING DESIRES to the far turn, roused forward to challenge for the lead near the quarter pole, battled on
heads apart with BLAZING DESIRES in stretch, was all out and fiercely combative but could not get by game winner. SUN SQUALL rated through early
stages then promoted along the outside around the far turn, raced wide and gathered momentum under strong handling and finished well. MY G P S
secured inside position on the first turn and stalked the pace to the far turn, moved out and out to a drive upper stretch but had no late kick.
KEEPSAKEKITTEN settled through early stages and saved ground around the far turn, moved out three to four wide in stretch and failed to threaten.
BAHAMIAN PARK raced in range down the backstretch then hustled along two wide around the far turn but could not move on. UYEDA rated along the
inside, saved ground on the far turn then faded in the lane. I'M MORE READY raced off the pace then wide in the stretch and failed to move into contention.
SHANGHAI MOON raced in the back and saved ground to no avail. ITSMYLUCKYKNIGHT took an awkward step after the start, steadied and lost ground
and never moved into contention. CHASING THE CANDY was done early.
