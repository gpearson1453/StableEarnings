Footnotes
FLORIDA BIRD took command early, showed the way along the inside, breather in the run into the far turn, remained clear in the drive while under steady
handling. TURNSTONE settled off the pace toward the inside, steered out three wide turning for home when advancing, proved no match for the winner in
the drive, clearly second best. MOCHA KISS tracked the pace along the inside, continued to race within striking distance, finished up best of the rest.
BUTTON MUSHROOM lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn, failed to muster any late gain. SATTERSFIELD last away, saved ground,
improved position in the drive while never a serious threat. COUNT UR BLESS'N one paced just off the inside, failed to muster. GET ONE MORE settled off
the pace and the inside, tired three wide. JEWELED CROWN chased the winner for six furlongs in the two path and gave way. BENDI BLU was finished
after a half.

Footnotes
FREEDOM HILL with the pace from the start while between rivals, shook clear into the stretch, kept to task to the wire. MONYDONTSPENITSELF within
striking distance off the inside, moved out to be four wide into the turn, advanced and tried the winner from the outside turning for home, lost some ground to
that foe into the lane, could not get back to that same rival late, held sway for the place. BAJAN CASH outrun in the early going off the inside, four wide
through the turn, staged a mild rally to capture the show. ANNIE'S CANDY broke out, raced in the second group outside, moved a bit closer four wide late i
the turn, lacked a further bid to finish up evenly. MEANBONE went one paced inside, lacked a closing response. STORMINSIDE in mid pack along the
inside, lacked a response. QUALIFLY vied up front in the early going, faded in the stretch. YOU'RE KILLIN ME off slowly, raced back, improved position
with some mild, belated interest. LOOKIE LOO void of speed for a half while between rivals, floated out four wide turning for home, passed tiring rivlas.
SENOR BLAIR failed to menace while racing in the two path. MISCHIEVOUS DANCER void of speed, three wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. V
TACH M. D. was finished after a half.

Footnotes
MACHO ROCCO close up early inside, dueled into the turn, garnered a larger advantage in upper stretch, driving. CROW MOUNTAIN dueled up front early
outside the winner, equal terms with that one into the turn in the two path, proved no match in the drive, narrowly held the place. J'S LITTLE MAN settled off
the early pace, dropped to the inside to save ground into the lane, steered out for the stretch run, finished willingly to be rapidly getting to the runner up late.
DINNER AT CRUMPIES lacked speed just off the inside, dropped inside for the run through the turn, finished up with some late interest to also be gaining
for the second spot. BROKEN TOGETHER in some traffic along the inside late in the run up the backstretch, moved off the inside a bit midway on the bend,
went evenly through the lane in lacking a finishing kick. THORNISH within striking distance while three wide and between horses into the turn, two back to
three wide late in the turn, had little left for the drive. AFRICAN WARRIOR off a step slow, raced well back while out in the strip, four wide through the turn,
picked off some tiring rivals while not a serious threat. DE LIVERMORE also off a step slow, raced far back, also improved by passing faltering foes, never a
threat. MOONSHINE MOMENT mid pack, tired while racing three wide. IRONIC lacked early foot, four out to five wide late in the turn, failed to muster a
rally. HOUSTON PIPE forwardly placed while four wide into the turn, tired while three wide exiting. UNBRIDLED SHOES off a step slow, trailed throughout
in showing little.

RHYTHM raced back, dropped inside into the far turn, steered back out to the two path, late in the final turn, finished willingly to be clearly second best, no
match for the winner. I WILL STAND in the second flight off the inside, four wide through the final turn, challenged late in the turn, vied, drifted in past the

middle half, challenged between foes late in the final turn, bothered slightly when tiring midstretch. SOLOMONIC in mid pack while off the inside, four wide
through the final turn, lacked a winning response when called on for the drive. ERNIE BANKS bothered slightly at the start, in mid pack while racing off the
inside, came up empty for the drive. MESA SKYLINE broke back, trailed for five furlongs, improved slightly by passing tiring rivals, no real threat. ROARING
FORK with the early pace, chased up the backstretch, bid second turn, slight lead midway on that bend, vied into the lane, closest to the rail, faltered in the
drive. ROCKO'S WHEEL was finished early along the inside. MOMENT bobbled just after the start, recovered to set the pace, angled to the inside when

Footnotes
URBANITE settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground into the far turn, moved out slightly when advancing on the leader late in the final turn,
engaged that one just inside the furlong ground, wore that rival down under firm handling, clear late. MARQUEE THUNDER broke alertly, set the pace along
the inside, responded when confronted by the winner with less than a furlong remaining, stubborn til late, held sway for the place. DEANOS CAPE void of
early foot, steered out five wide when rallying late in the final turn, finished willingly down the middle of the track to be gaining for the show. AHSAD settled
outside, continued in the main body the middle half, came four wide out of the final turn, not enough late for the show. MO AND GO within striking distance
off the inside, came four wide out of the final turn, came up empty for the stretch drive. BEE BRIDGE closest to the runner up most of the way, had little left
for the drive. SEMI CHARMED DAY went one paced throughout while racing inside through the final turn. MCSHADY void of speed, made little impact.
WICKED CITI remained back in failing to menace. UNWANTED INTRUDER was always outrun while racing outside. SQUARED STRAIGHT forwardly
placed for a half, stopped.

Footnotes
BUMP BAILEY broke alertly, dueled up front in the two path into the turn, clear exiting the turn, larger advantage past the furlong marker, enough left to
narrowly hold the next two safe at the wire. EXULTATION in the second flight off the inside, came four wide out of the turn, finished up willingly while widest
of the first flight at the wire, game for the place. BOTERO lacked speed while racing toward the inside for a half, steered out to be three wide into the stretch,
also closed ground of the winner late, outkicked for the place while between the top two at the wire. ALEX'S STRIKE void of speed, continued back through
the turn in the two path, in traffic and a bit tight a furlong out, brushed, recovered and finished well along the inside while too late. BELEWS GOLD went
evenly while racing three wide. T C'S IMAGE lacked early speed outside, came five wide exiting the turn, improved position a bit with some mild late
interest. YOUNG PHILLIP dueled up front closest to the inside, gave way exiting the turn. HIDDEN PROMISE lacked early foot, saved ground turn, in tight,
checked up in tight quarters along the rail when continuing to be one paced nearing the furlong grounds, did not recover. HARLEQUIN forwardly placed
early outside, four wide into the turn, five wide exiting when beginning to weaken, continued to fade in the drive. GENERAL MILES last away, raced four
wide into and through the turn, failed to rally in the drive. SAMMYS DREAM settled off the early pace in the two path, was finished before a half.

Footnotes
SPOKANE EAGLE bothered slightly just before a furlong in traffic, tracked the two leaders into the turn, tilted out to be three wide turning for home, engaged
the dueling leaders nearing the furlong ground, took over and edged clear under firm handling. FASCILITATOR back off the early pace well out in the strip,
began a steady advance while four wide far turn, continued to close with good resolve to be in time for the place. I'M CORFU broke alertly, dueled up front
closest to the inside, vied into the lane and past the furlong marker, weakened a bit in the late going but saved the show spot by daylight. COURTING A
KISS dueled up front closest to the inside, weakened. RACER asked early to maintain inside position in the second flight, continued to save ground turn,
went evenly through the lane in lacking a late punch. COAL TRUTH broke back, improved position while saving ground through the turn, shifted out for the
drive and also went one paced to the wire. STAY HOME last away, raced back, came five wide out of the turn, improved mid track with some mild late
interest. WHISKEY ECHO broke back, raced in some traffic late in the turn while in the three path, came up empty when clear for the drive.
TENTWELVEFOURTEEN made little impact. KING OF THE COURT void of speed out in the strip, remained back while four wide. WHENTHEDOVESCRY
chased the dueling leaders while four wide and gave way when the real running started at the head of the lane. SEVIER tired while racing four wide through
the turn.

Footnotes
LUNA FORTIS forward from the start, stalked the issue three wide up the backstretch and into the far turn, bid midway on that bend, took over, clear, held
the runner up at bay late under steady handling. OUT OF TROUBLE in the second flight while saving ground, continued inside the middle half mile, steered
out to be three wide when beginning to advance turning for home, slow gain on the winner late, clearly second best. DEPUTY DORA lacked early foot off
the inside, raced three out to four wide late in the final bend rallied mildly outside to gain the show, no threat to the top pair. LEMON DROP KITTY broke
back, continued to lack speed in the run up the backstretch, saved ground far turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. KISS MORE took
command into the first turn inside, showed the way the middle half, gave way when headed turning for home. CRYSTAL LAKE off slow, moved up to be a
forward factor into the first turn, bit rank, got out midway on that bend, continued to race mid pack, had little for the drive. MADAME BARBARIAN was never
dangerous while racing three wide. ROAD TEST went one paced throughout while racing in the two path. DRINKATTHECREEK pressured the leader for six
furlongs, moved a bit closer in the second turn then gave way in the drive. RESURRECTION ROAD steadily faded while racing four wide.

Footnotes
LUCKY BETTY settled off the pace inside, moved a bit closer before a half, moved out to be three wide in some traffic late in the second turn, bid, strongly
clear. AUCTION FEVER void of early foot, four out to five wide turning for home, rallied for the place, no match for the winner. SEATTLE SLANG lacked
speed, checked up in tight into the far turn, fell back, moved out, four wide in traffic into the stretch, rallied for the show. MAGINE mid pack off the inside
early, four wide through the final turn, closer turning for home, flattened out in the drive. COPPER NICKEL four wide in the firs turn within striking distance,
continued to race forwardly into the far turn, came up empty when asked in the drive. ELUSIVE RIDE off slowly, raced well back off the inside, improved
position, not a real thr4eat. LIGHTNING BUG prompted the early pace while off the inside, had little left for the drive. RAGGEDY ANNIE settled well back off
the pace, raced off the inside, came in slightly to appear to tighten up SEATTLE SLANG into the far turn, had little left for the drive. FIRST EMPRESS was
never a factor. HENNY FLY vied up front along the inside for six furlongs then gave way in the drive. RUMPLEMINX with the early pace outside, dueled up
the backstretch, stopped in the second turn.
