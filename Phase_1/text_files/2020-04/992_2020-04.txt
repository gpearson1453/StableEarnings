Footnotes
TIME N MONEY showed speed from the inside then came out in the early stages, cleared outside foes and widened around the turn, led by daylight into the
stretch and continued to increase the margin to the wire. RIGGSKI between rivals and forced out early, angled in and chased the pacesetter, went two wide
around the turn and lasted for the place. CHERRY PIE broke out and bumped rival at the start, angled in then steadied briefly behind a rival near the
three-eighths marker and angled back out, went three wide then four wide into the stretch, showed a mild response but missed the place. SOUND
CHECKERS showed brief speed while three deep then forced out early, chased outside a rival, three wide into the lane and never rallied. KENZLEE'S GOV
reserved in the early going, angled toward the inside, saved ground around the turn and failed to respond when asked. RIGHTFUL bumped at the start,
lacked early speed, traveled five wide into the lane and was never a threat. AUTISM WARRIOR forced out early, traveled a bit off the rail, two wide then
drifted out on the turn and weakened.

right-handed near the sixteenth pole and held well under hand urging late. CEE SAM'S GIRL lacked early speed, angled to the inside, moved out into the
two path on the turn, came out again in upper stretch, rallied and edged rival for the place. IN IT FOR LIFE stalked the pace in the two path, saved ground
from the inside on the turn, came out in the lane and was edged for the place. HOPE WINS tracked off the rail, went three to four wide around the turn,
floated out by a rival in upper stretch and went evenly through the final furlong. LINDA AND MINDA dueled from the inside, fought back around the turn but
lost ground approaching the stretch and gave way in the late stages. FAMILY TRIPS off the rail in the early stages then angled in, lacked room and checked

JEN'S JOURNEY hustled to the front from the outside, set the pace clear up the backstretch, angled over and took control of the rail, felt pressure from the
outside but quickly cleared once again and drew away through the final furlong. CASH ENCOUNTER stalked outside a rival, made a mild bid outside of
JEN'S JOURNEY on the turn but lost contact once more leaving the bend and chased the winner to the wire. SWISS CHEESE stalked from the inside, a bit
off the rail into the stretch and held the show. CANNES raced outside a rival, two wide on the turn and lacked a rally. SEATOSHININGSEA went five wide
up the backstretch, four wide through the turn and could not rally. CONEJOS settled along the inside with a rival to the outside, in tight and checked entering
