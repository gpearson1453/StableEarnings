Footnotes
GRAY SKY in the second flight three wide in the first turn, early move outside, clear, maintained daylight in the two path second turn, drifted stretch, held
sway. EIGHTS AND ACES forwardly placed early off the inside, fell back the middle half, asked far turn, brushed while three wide into the stretch, bothered
a furlong out, steered in, finished up willingly to be slowly getting to the winner late. BUBBAS DIXIE lacked early foot, advanced on the outside second turn,
four wide, brushed into the stretch, lugged in a furlong out, outfinished for the place spot. MESA SKYLINE off a step slow, raced back off the inside, three
wide out of the final turn, staged a mild rally to improved position. DAPPER JACK narrowly showed the way first turn along the inside, dueled onto the
backstretch with entrymate, fell back before a half, went evenly through the stretch. HINTON made an early toward the front while three wide, chased the
winner into and through the second turn, had little left for the stretch run. KRISTI'S COPILOT went one paced off the inside, came up empty for the drive.
TITOCHIP failed to menace while racing outside. ALBIREO remained always back. AULT vied up front early, gave way.

Footnotes
LISTEN TO ROSE outrun in the early going, steered out four wide turning for home, closed with good resolve to be up in time. BLANCO BRONCO six wide
into the first turn, continued well wide onto the backstretch, five wide into the far turn, rallied outside and also finished up willingly. RANDOM AFFAIR broke
on top, cleared toward the inside, set the pace, continued to hold a considerable advantage through upper stretch, faltered late but managed to save the
show. MOON IN THE SKY lacked speed along the inside, came in the two path into the stretch while splitting foes bothered slightly in some traffic mid
stretch, finished up evenly. EGOMANIAC settled off the pace while just off the inside, fell back the middle half, improved position in the drive without posing
a serious threat. HOT IRON five wide into the first turn while inside the runner up, continued to run with that one up the backstretch, four wide through the
second turn, went evenly in the drive. MY SUGAR TOWN forwardly placed inside, had little left for the drive. RISKY SITUATION four wide into the first turn,
raced in mid pack, lacked a response in the drive. GOTTA LOVE IKE closest to the leader two path, continued to chase that one up the backstretch and into
the far turn, gave way in the drive. BIGGS was finished after a half. DUKE OF ARGYLE broke back, trailed, well beaten, showed little. SEQUENCE was
never close, eased late, walked in.

Footnotes
GRAB THE MUNNY in the main group early off the inside, three wide and between rivals into the lane when roused, late surge to be edging away at the
end. CALCULATING KING stalked the pace off the the inside, also raced three wide into the lane, challenged and took over inside the furlong marker,
caught late to prove no match for the winner in the waning strides. COME ON DOVER fell back after breaking with the leaders, was four wide through the
turn, made a late run down the middle part of the strip to be in time for the show. SWITHER'S SHORTCUT settled off the pace toward the inside, two path
turn, improved with some modest late interest while outkicked late for the show. FIREHORN within striking distance for a half in the second flight, came up
empty for the drive. ZEROED IN broke on top, narrowly set the early pace inside, dueled through the turn and into the stretch, faltered the final furlong.
FEELING IT moved up the opening quarter to duel for the lead off the inside, continued to alternate the middle quarter, caved in during the final furlong.
PLATINUM NIGHTS floated out at the start to be bothered, remained back in failing to menace. R H SMOAKEM lacked a response. BUCK DUANE tired
while racing four wide. ICE CRUSH remained always back. WHEN I DO last away, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LUCKY BETTY dueled up into and through the first turn closest to the inside, fell back before a half, moved back to the front along the rail late backstretch,
alternated through the second turn, shook clear stretch, kept to task. CHEROKEE MAIDEN four wide in the first turn when behind the pace, continued
outside, four wide again in the second bend, proved no match for the winner while edging clear for the second spot late. MALIBU MARLEE off a step slow,
recovered to race behind the pace inside, continued to save ground through the second bend when moving closer, lacked a further bid while finishing best
of the rest. KIZZY B forwardly placed while behind the dueling leaders, remained within striking distance through the second turn and into the lane, lacked a
closing response to finish up evenly. BEST INTENTIONS four wide into the first turn, continued one paced in lacking a closing response. SACRED UNION
void of speed in trailing for six furlongs, picked up a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SLIME QUEEN set or forced the pace off the
inside for six furlongs then began to give way, continued to fade through the stretch. NEVER SAY CAN'T in the two path behind the pace, stopped.

Footnotes
DRENA'S STAR showed the way early, allowed the leader to go into the turn, moved out, regained the advantage turning for home, drew off under token
encouragement to win ridden out. FULL OF RUN last to leave, raced back off the pace and the inside, raced four out to five wide late in the turn when
beginning to advanced, finished willingly while widest in the drive to earn the place, no threat to the winner. FAREEQ well wide in the run up the backstretch,
angled in when clearing into the turn, briefly dueled with the winner entering the stretch, also proved no match for that one in the drive, caught late for the
place. STAY HOME off the early pace and the inside while between horses, angled out to be four wide late in the turn when moving a bit closer, flattened
out in the final furlong. HERE'S CARLOS void of early foot toward the inside, steered out slightly for the drive, lacked needed bid. LEO tired while racing
closest to the inside.

HIDDEN RULER in the second flight while out in the strip, came four wide out of the turn, finished with good late energy to win going away. BOX OF
CHOCOLATES off a step slow, raced back, swung out to be five wide turning for home, finished willingly to be up for the place. MARKET KING pressured
the leader four wide, took over from that one nearing the furlong marker, proved no match for the top two late, clear of the others. SECRET BISCUIT away
in good order, took command and showed the way into the turn while in the three path, continued three wide into the stretch, dueled past the furlong marker
and began to tire. EXULTATION lacked speed, four wide through the turn, improved a bit into the lane then lacked a further bid. METROPOL void of speed,
came four wide out of the turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest. AGGRESSIVITY lacked speed along the inside, two path into the lane, in some
traffic nearing midstretch, bothered slightly, finished up evenly when clear. BELEWS GOLD forwardly placed in the early going, retreated while racing off the
inside, drifted in approaching the furlong marker. JACK VAN BERG was finished after a half. UNCLE MOMO steadily faded along the inside.

Footnotes
KIMARI off the early pace, moved off the inside, steadied slightly in some traffic into the turn, steered out to be four wide turning for home, set down,
finished resolutely down the center of the strip to be in time. FRANK'S ROCKETTE broke alertly, prompted the pace off the inside, advanced to duel late in
the turn, showed the way past the furlong marker, led late, could not contain the winner. EDGEWAY away in good order, set the pace toward the inside,
dueled late in the turn while inside the runner up, vied past the furlong marker then weakened late, comfortably held the show. WASABI GIRL lacked early
foot, four wide through the turn, improved position slightly in the drive, not a threat to the top three. BOOTYTAMA within striking distance off the inside,
came in slightly into the turn to bother inner rivals, pursued the top two through the turn and then faltered. LADY GLAMOUR last away, raced back early,
picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat. KISS THE GIRL broke back, trailed most of the way, carried out entering the stretch, also
passed tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. RING LEADER stumbled at the start, quickly recovered to race in the second flight along the inside,
steadied in tight along the rail into the turn, faded through the stretch. LEXI ON THE MOVE in mid pack and three wide for a half, backed up through the
stretch.

Footnotes
DON VITO CORLEONE broke with the field, stalked the two leaders in the three path first turn, maintained contact with that pair in the run up the
backstretch, vied four wide far turn, vied into the lane, edged clear, held. COPPER KING lacked early foot, began a steady gain along the inside in the
second turn, getting to the winner late, clearly second best. AZTEC EMPIRE back off the early pace, three wide first turn, moved inside, advanced and
challenged along the rail into the far turn, gained the lead, vied with the winner into the lane, unable to match strides with that one the final furlong, could not
contain the runner up. ON D'ORO void of speed for five furlongs, advanced off the inside, staged a mild rally to improve position. WILD UNION settled in
mid pack while off the inside, asked along and steered out four wide midway on the final turn, came up empty for the drive. TIZ THE JOURNEY void of
speed, continued to lag into the far turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest to also improve position. LOOKIN HIGH five wide into the first turn,
continued outside, closer while once again five wide into the far bend, flattened out in the drive. STONEGATE pressured the pace while off the inside,
faltered in the drive. WHITE WOLF in the second flight early along the inside, faded. WILD AND GOLDEN remained always back in showing little. GREAT
FACES set the pace in the two path, gave way when headed far turn. MO AND GO staged a steady retreat.
