Footnotes
LOST THE MINISTER unhurried in the beginning, angled in some on the backstretch, angled in and saved ground around the turn, bid from the inside
entering the stretch, gained command mid-stretch and prevailed over the stubborn runner-up. BOB AGAIN stalked off the rail, went outside the leader on the
turn and gained a short advantage, came four wide into the stretch, battled with the winner through the lane, dug in late but could not get by. LOVE AND
HOLD set the pace to the turn, dueled with LOST THE MINISTER around the turn two then three wide into the stretch and could not match the top pair in
the late stages. IMPEACHMENT ACE stalked the pace off the rail, raced four wide then five wide leaving the turn and could not rally. GO SAMMY GO
angled in on the backstretch and raced a bit off the inside, took the turn two wide and also failed to rally. DECOSTER stumbled leaving the gate, angled
outside up the backstretch, moved further out and traveled six wide nearing the eighth pole and had little left for the drive.

SPEEDY RIDE raced outside a rival on the backstretch then a bit off the rail on the turn, shifted out and bumped rival at the eighth pole, split foes in upper
stretch, closed inside the leader and drew clear to win going away. MOUNTAIN VIEW sped to the front, set the pace from the two path into the turn, inched
away around the bend then lugged out nearing the stretch, corrected course and held command clear to the sixteenth pole but was overtaken by SPEEDY
RIDE in the late stages. VERMEER stalked the leader while outside a rival, took the turn two to three wide, bumped by the winner entering the stretch,
lacked the needed response in the lane and held the show. HEAT THINGS UP unhurried in the beginning, traveled four wide around the turn and came with
a belated rally to improve. MINIMAL MISTAKE stumbled leaving the gate, chased the speed while wide in the early stages, angled in entering the turn while
outside a rival, angled back out leaving the turn and failed to respond when asked. NAHOY tracked along the inside to the turn, a bit off the rail entering the
stretch and proved no menace. OUR MANEKI CAT chased outside the leader,, along the inside through the turn and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
SOPRESCIOUS stalked the pacesetter outside a rival, went four wide around the turn, bumped in upper stretch, dug in late and edged the runner-up.
HAPPIER TOGETHER sped to the front, set the pace from off the rail, angled into the two path entering the turn, held a short advantage at the eighth pole,
drifted out in upper stretch, battled through the lane and was bested by the winner. LAST DANCE BELLA stalked from the inside, looked to advance but
lacked room and steadied on the turn, gained a clear path and rallied along inside but was outfinished. REDHOTNREADYTOWED off the rail in the early
going, went three wide around the turn, drifted out and bumped outside rival then in a bit tight between foes in upper-stretch, challenged in the late stages
but could not summon the needed late kick. I B BUZZIN settled off the pace, outside a rival into and around the turn, exited the turn two to three wide,
angled out in the stretch and never rallied. VIRGINIA HALL steadied off the heels of a rival early, tucked inside and saved ground on the turn and weakened
in the lane.
