Footnotes
BARB'S VALENTINE sped clear and held a comfortable advantage while crossing over to the inside, padded the lead around the turn and into the stretch,
weakened a bit in the final sixteenth but still held safely. BAYONCE stalked the pacesetter in the early going, traveled two wide then angled out and came
four wide into the stretch, rallied late but could not get to the winner. ARRIVEDERCI AMORE chased from a bit off the rail, tucked down along the inside on
the turn then angled out and enered the stretch three wide, lacked the needed response in the drive but held the show. TENGA'S JEWEL off slow at the
start, saved ground into the stretch and improved position. GRACIE'S GIRL veered out and bumped rival leaving the gate, went two wide through the turn
and never rallied. BRITE TAN bumped by rival at the start, angled out early, raced three wide then four wide leaving the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
ANA LISA set pace the pace from the outside, angled in nearing the turn, drew off around the bend and won easy. WICKED SUNSET chased from the
inside into and around the turn and was clearly second best. COALINGA HILLS asked in the early stages, chased from off the rail, drifted out under
left-handed urging near the five-sixteenths pole, traveled four to five wide around the turn and had little left for the drive. ROSEANNADANA chased while
outside a rival, two wide into the turn then three wide entering the stretch and weakened.
