Footnotes
JOST SAYIN shifted in and bumped hard with STRELLA'S WAR at the start, took closer order through the run up the backstretch, bid along the rail turning
for home and edged away late. ROSA STAR prompted the pace outside CATSOUTOFTHEBAG, challenged for command into the lane, could not kick on
with the winner but finished with good courage. SHE FLED THE SCENE bumped with STRELLA'S WAR at the start, then was bumped between that one
and GEA, lagged well back early inside, moved off the rail approaching the stretch, and rallied mildly outside the top two finishers. STRELLA'S WAR got
sandwiched at the start between JOST SAYIN and SHE FLED THE SCENE and was shut off, raced well back to the lane and improved outside while not a
threat. AERODYNAMIC moved out three wide midway through the first turn, stayed in range to the stretch and lacked a solid response.
CATSOUTOFTHEBAG established an easy pace for six furlongs, gave way into the final furlong and was overhauled from both sides. GEA bumped with
SHE FLED THE SCENE after the start, and failed to menace. KISSES FOR TIZZY had the two-path on the turns, and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
QUINOA TIFAH chased outside LIME from the start, finished determinedly and proved best through the late stages. LIME quickly gained command, showed
the way clear in the two-path around the turn, jumped back to her left lead weakening in deep stretch and could not hold off the top one while best of the
others. PRETZEL was outsprinted in the four-path to the top of the lane, and could not gain. AWESOME VIEW was outsprinted inside early, angled to the
far outside at the top of the stretch and did not factor. SOPHISTICURL was outrun three wide. SISTER AURORA broke a step slow and was always outrun.
KITTEN'S DREAM showed little inside.

Footnotes
LEGENDARY PRINCE angled inside and raced in tracking mode, tipped out a path and picked up the pace near the quarter pole then swept by along the
outside under a strong hand and finished going away. WEEKEND DREAMER broke on top then conceded position to BYCHANCE, remained forwardly
placed behind rival around the turn, advanced and held a slim lead at the eighth pole then was no match when the winner moved by. VIOLENT FIGHT
angled to the inside in opening stages, saved ground on the rail into the stretch run then shifted out wider under left handed pressure and produced a
decent finish. MORE THAN USUAL hustled along in steady pursuit, ran on five wide with a furlong left to run and gained position without threatening.
BYCHANCE got carried out wider at the start then sped to the lead, held clear around the turn, briefly matched strides near the eighth pole then came up
tired. UNO BABY BIRD raced in range along the inside around the turn then faded in the lane. TERRY JADE raced two to three wide and failed to move into
contention. NIT PICK had no response. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL broke out at the start, chased two wide around the turn then retreated. MR. VECCHIO
got in tight along the rail and was taken up sharply after the start and never recovered.

Footnotes
PROBABLY GRACE raced in contention and began to edge up three wide leaving the turn, vied for the lead with CHIC AND SEXY to mid-stretch then drew
clear. CHIC AND SEXY took over the early lead and led the way around the turn, vied for the lead with PROBABLY GRACE entering top of the lane, battled
back until mid-stretch then failed to be a match. TAKE CHARGE AGAIN was awkward and a step slow at the start, raced wide while reserved through early
stages, showed response racing wide under strong handling upper stretch then finished well to gain a share. CHERORAMA raced off the early pace then
hustled along five to four wide in the lane and gained position without threatening. VARSOVIA bobbled at the start, raced off the pace and saved ground
then shifted out in the lane and passed tiring foes. GREY MANNERS briefly held the lead then conceded position but remained in contention and chased
around the turn then gave way. QUEEN KANTHAROS hustled along three to four wide in steady pursuit then failed to factor in the lane. CROWN REAL
chased up close along the inside in early stages then steadily faded. INCREDIBLE MISS showed interest while hustled along two wide around the turn then
retreated. LUXE DIAMOND raced off the pace along the outside and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
STORMY DERBY DAY grabbed the early lead, rated along inside through a slow pace, responded when challenged by SUMMERI IN THE CITY through the
lane, and was edging away to the finish. SUMMER IN THE CITY prompted the pace outside STORMY DERBY DAY as a deliberate six furlongs unfolded,
had aim through the stretch but could not get by while best of the rest. JOKER LADY saved ground in range to the top of the stretch, and was one-paced to
the wire in the two-path. UNFORESEEN was keyed up under a hold outside rivals through the middle stages, raced three wide around the far turn, and
passed tired horses. KAHIKO was reserved through the opening stages, and lacked a response when roused. R U ROYALTY was strung out four wide on
the first turn, stayed in range for six furlongs and faded. OUR FANTASY steadied lacking room inside to the first turn, never got out of the second flight and
was in tight late on the rail. MARAIS broke slowly and trailed early inside, moved out four wide to the far turn and posed no threat. EL SCORCHO broke
awkwardly at the back, and was outrun through a four-wide journey. WICKED MERCURY steadied and checked in tight through the first turn between rivals,
and was empty when asked. TOASTNJAM prompted the pace four then three wide to the far turn, and tired after six furlongs. MISS CHEENY steadied on
the first turn, went along reserved inside through the middle fractions, and was through before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
JOYFUL HEART was crowded by EXTRA EXTRA at the start and lagged well back early, ranged up four wide after six furlongs, and rallied steadily outside
to prove best after a long drive. BOURBON CURRENCY became edgy in the gate prior to the start, came away in good order and tracked the leaders in the
clear, bid in the three-path between horses through upper stretch and continued on gamely. EXTRA EXTRA broke outward, vied inside CONQUER through
a quick early pace, maintained a short advantage for six furlongs, got collared into the lane and ran on to hold a share along the fence. LUCKY MIKE
advanced mildly around the far turn in the two-path, moved out past the furlong marker and finished with interest outside the leaders. PRINCE KHOZAN
was reserved early inside, loomed in the two-path with a quarter-mile remaining, but flattened out. CLAMOR raced three wide around the turns, and lacked
the needed response. CONQUER went looking for the early lead but could not clear from EXTRA EXTRA, stayed after that one to the far turn and
backpedaled before reaching the stretch. LOOKIN AT ROSES was no factor inside. RHYTHM WITH SOUL was slow into stride, entered the backstretch
well out in the course, and showed little.

Footnotes
GENGHIS tossed his head and stumbled at the break, advanced to contention three wide after a half-mile, kept to task determinedly through the stretch and
wore down BIG HAMBONE from outside to prevail. BIG HAMBONE pressed the early pace, took over outside CHINOMADO after a half-mile, drove clear
after six furlongs, but weakened in the last sixteenth of a mile. DIZZY SIGHT exchanged brushes with KHOZY MY BOY approaching the turn, raced four
wide into the stretch and finished evenly. AWESOME PARTY lodged a brief bid in the two-path on the turn, but was finished before reaching the stretch.
KHOZY MY BOY exchanged brushes inside DIZZY SIGHT late on the backstretch, and tired. JANUARY WON was never a factor. CHINOMADO set the
early pace inside, could not match strides with BIG HAMBONE after a half-mile, and was eased up through the late stages.

ST JOE VIPER led the way into the first turn then came under attack from HERO UP and wrangled back to race in tracking mode, began to take closer
order past the quarter pole then given cue and roused forward to clear the lead a furlong out and held firm under steady pressure. WARRANT OFFICER
settled near the inside down the backstretch, picked up the pace and angled out past the quarter pole, raced five wide entering top stretch, sustained a
steady effort and got up for place. HERO UP bumped the rail entering the first turn then cleared on top and set the pace down the backstretch, remained the
leader entering top stretch then got collared by the winner near the eighth pole and gave way. DRAMA IN DIXIE tracked the pace down the backstretch,
hustled up around the far turn and into stretch run but lacked the needed response for serious impact. SCAR got carried out on the first turn then remained
reserved to the far turn, hustled along and raced widest in the lane and gained position without threatening. EXATLON settled off the pace along the inside
and failed to move on when called upon. EARTHQUAKE got carried out wide on the first turn, rated three to four wide down the backstretch, saved ground
on the far turn and offered no late bid. ALL D' HYPE got carried out on the first turn, raced off the pace and dropped back after the half.

around the turn and into top stretch, dug in gamely under firm pressure and drew clear. R MERCEDES BOY raced up close then launched a bid near the
half mile marker, vied for the lead around the turn and fought back upper stretch, could not move on with the winner in final furlong but finished clear for
second best. GAME BOY BENNY got bumped just after the start, hustled along in steady pursuit into stretch run and sustained bid to gain a share. JUST
KIDDING took a solid bump at the start, raced off the pace then widest in stretch run and gained position without threatening. UNPUBLISHED moved up to
challenge for the lead near the half mile marker, vied around the turn then came out wider and flattened in the lane. CHARLIE THE GREEK raced off the
early pace and failed to move into late contention. ABSOLUTE GRIT drifted out and bumped hard with rival at the start then angled to the inside, steadied
nearing the half mile marker then angled out and had no late response. QUICK STEP ED got bumped at the start, raced in the back and failed to move into

Footnotes
REAL MONEY raced in the second flight near the inside for three furlongs, was guided out in upper stretch and kicked in with a good response to get up
late. CAPTAIN RON steadied and got shuffled back between horses midway on the turn in the three-path, shifted to the far outside through the furlong
grounds and finished gamely. LONG BLADE pressed the early pace three wide, reached the front outside FACTORINO after three-eighths of a mile, briefly
pulled clear past the eighth-pole, then drifted out under left-hand pressure weakening to the finish. CUCINA was outrun early inside, found his best stride in
mid stretch and finished willingly in the two-path. FACTORINO set a pressured pace inside, and weakened in the final furlong. SARASOTA COUNTY was
no factor in the two-path. PRINCE OF THIEVES broke slowly and lacked speed into the turn three wide. QUARKY pressed the early pace between horses,
and faltered in the stretch.

NICK THE CARDSHARK chased outside the leaders four wide to the stretch, rallied steadily and overhauled VALDOCCO from outside in the closing yards.
VALDOCCO argued the pace three wide, took over outside SILENT TIGER late on the turn, moved clear through mid stretch but could not hold off the
winner. SILENT TIGER contested the pace inside from the start, weakened through the furlong grounds but stayed on well enough to salvage the show.
FRENCH QUARTER stayed in range two wide to the lane, and lacked a solid final response on the wrong lead. PASS THE GRAVY fought up front in the
two-path for nearly three furlongs, and faded in the drive. ELUSIVE RO hit the left side of the gate at the start, and was outrun. PACHANGA PARTY raced
four to five wide around the turn, and did not menace. GRAN MALBEC saved ground to no avail. LI'L MEATBALL bobbled at the start to get away slowly,
and was outrun four wide. VERY AMUSING was through early three wide.
