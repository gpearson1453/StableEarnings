Footnotes
TREVESS broke to the lead, rated along near the inside for three furlongs, got set down turning for home and widened under pressure. FAST CATALINA
chased after TREVESS from outside throughout, could not keep pace into the lane and ran on best of the rest. DINNER AT FIVE cut over in front of
FEATHER'S SECRET near the half-mile pole, had the leaders in range around the turn, but could not gain. SENSE A MILLION broke inward, raced four
wide and lacked a rally. FEATHER'S SECRET got shuffled back behind DINNER AT FIVE nearing the turn, stayed on the rail and failed to menace. BOOKS
bumped with ELLA'S ISLAND at the start, raced forwardly three wide to the turn, and faded after three furlongs. SHELL BEACH PARTY broke out bumping
WONDER CHARM at the start, brushed with the latter for several strides early on, and tired in the stretch. VICTORY CRUSADE broke outward spotting the
field a couple lengths, raced four to five wide and never got close. MIRANDA SOFIA trailed to the stretch and made little headway on the far outside.
ELLA'S ISLAND was bumped between horses at the start, brushed with WONDER CHARM soon after that, and retired early. THE VELVET BEAST showed
little inside. WONDER CHARM bumped with SHELL BEACH PARTY and ELLA'S ISLAND at the start, got jostled around between those two for several
strides and bobbled soon after that, and dropped far back.

Footnotes
SALSA RITA tracked the leaders three wide, ranged up to challenge a quarter-mile out, and forged past from outside through the last furlong. SUZ sprinted
clear early, vied inside MEMORIZE around the turn, and kept on with good courage to hold the place. MEMORIZE chased SUZ up the backstretch, bid
outside that one midway on the turn, poked a head in front approaching the stretch, but weakened in the late stages. NOWITNA RIVER received several
cracks of the whip after breaking a step slow, raced five wide around the turn, and gained belatedly on the far outside. POCKET OF CANDY failed to
threaten four wide.

Footnotes
INGREIDO crossed over to the early lead inside, repelled a challenge from STRONG ENDING in the run around the turn, opened up into the lane and
widened under a drive. STRONG ENDING was never far back, went up to vie for command outside INGREIDO through the turn, could not match strides
turning for home and kept on to hold second. BIP BIP FULL POWER bumped hard with CONSILIUM at the start, lagged well back for a half-mile, briefly
looked like a threat along the rail in upper stretch, but could not sustain the rally. CONSILIUM bumped solidly with BIP BIP FULL POWER at the start, was
up near the front between rivals early, could not keep pace into the turn, and faded. MIGHTY FAST faded three then four wide on the turn. NICK NICK was
taken to the far outside soon after the start, dropped far back after six furlongs and was eased up in the lane.

Footnotes
DON'T GET KHOZY advanced around the turn three wide, came through a big opening to take over inside rivals in upper stretch, and dug in to fend off
BLESSED BEAST to the finish. BLESSED BEAST was outrun early inside, swung four wide approaching the stretch, rallied through a large opening
between DON'T GET KHOZY and FAST VENEZUELA in mid stretch, and just missed. FAST VENEZUELA bumped with ANGELIC KNUGGET at the start,
set the pace off the rail, drifted out considerably carrying out MARCHING IN and PRINCESS ULELE at the top of the stretch, and continued to bear out in
front of MARCHING IN through the furlong grounds while hard to handle. MARCHING IN pressed the early pace outside, got carried well out in the track by
FAST VENEZUELA turning for home, then had to alter course inside as the latter continued coming out in front of her in mid stretch. LALALI bumped with
ANGELIC KNUGGET at the start, bumped with that same rival again early, and posed no threat. PRINCESS ULELE was away alertly despite breaking
outward, chased after the leaders from outside, got carried way wide outside FAST VENEZUELA and MARCHING IN coming off the turn, and faded through
the lane. ANGELIC KNUGGET bumped with LALALI at the start, bumped with that one again early, and was finished leaving the turn. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS INQUIRY, FAST VENEZUELA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD POSITION AND PLACED FOURTH FOR IMPEDING MARCHING IN.

Footnotes
ETERNAL PEACE settled in midpack for six furlongs, came four to five wide off the far turn, rallied to overtake WINNIPEG WONDER in deep stretch, and
just held on. TALKING BOOK broke slowly and was well back to the stretch, moved to the far outside past the furlong marker and just missed with a
last-ditch surge. WINNIPEG WONDER was nursed along on the lead inside, remained clear past the eighth-pole, but was overhauled in the final 50 yards.
COME STORMING was keyed up early three wide, had aim between horses through mid stretch, but did not have enough. ALL I NEED prompted the pace
outside WINNIPEG WONDER, moved to the rail for the drive and had no rally. REARRANGE moved up widest of all approaching the far turn, loomed a
threat in the four-path turning for home, and flattened out late. GIBBERISH tugged her way along three wide early, lodged a mild bid between horses after
six furlongs, and weakened in upper stretch. POP A CHOC was a bit anxious pocketed in behind the early leaders, and gave way on the rail into the lane.
ADRIATIC HOLIDAY steadied in tight going to the first turn three wide, moved further out after that and could not reach contention. DELIGHTFUL
DREAMER was outrun two wide on the turns. WIND DREAMER stayed in range early, and dropped back inside through the far turn.

Footnotes
BAREEQA stayed in striking distance three wide early, was put to pressure midway on the far turn without making much headway, stayed on task into the
stretch and kicked in to wear down SCATNAP from outside nearing the wire. SCATNAP prompted the pace outside KATIELEIGH from the start, wrested
command in mid stretch and briefly pulled clear, but could not hold off the winner. KATIELEIGH set the pace inside to the stretch, yielded approaching the
eighth-pole and had enough to salvage the show. SISTER GEMA was outrun early, swung five wide approaching the stretch, and gained mildly.
CODRINGTON was outrun early inside, came three wide into the lane and passed tired horses. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN advanced four wide through the
middle stages, but flattened out. BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD was forwardly placed early two wide, and faded after six furlongs. FREE TO FLY was no factor
inside. DANCE TILL DAWN fought restraint on the rail through the opening quarter-mile, and was empty when roused.

Footnotes
TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR was forwardly placed up the inside in opening stages then vied for the lead with BROOKES ALL MINE, edged back briefly then
switched out a path and moved back up to challenge BROOKES ALL MINE for the lead, battled on along the outside determinedly in stretch run and moved
away late. BROOKES ALL MINE held a slim out of the chute then vied for the lead racing outside of TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR, briefly cleared on top when rival
edged back briefly then came back under attack while positioned along the inside, dueled into the lane and put in a game effort but had closing kick left in
reserve. CACCIATORA (VEN) settled through early stages along the rail, picked up the pace and saved ground around the turn, continued with interest up
the inside through the stretch run and cleared show. GRACE'S DRAMA rated four wide through early stages, launched a bid along the outside around the
turn then weakened in the stretch. QUICK POINT was unhurried and raced widest down the backstretch, came under a ride on the far turn, raced widest in
the lane and lacked a needed rally. DENVER raced in or near the rear then ridden along five wide into the lane and failed to move into contention.
KINDHEARTED KOTA was unhurried while two wide through early stages and failed to launch the needed response to be a contending factor. PUT
POSITION tracked the pace down the backstretch then failed to advance under pressure on the turn and faded. DURLYN raced in range through down the
backstretch then began to weaken on the far turn.

late on the far turn then given cue top of the lane, advanced to briefly vie for the lead with MYSTIC LANCELOT then kicked clear. MYSTIC LANCELOT
prompted the pace down the backstretch then moved up to take a slim lead at the quarter pole, fought back when challenged near furlong grounds then
gave way grudgingly. NO WORD rated near mid-range to the far turn, picked up the pace and raced three wide between foes at the quarter pole, brushed
with rival top of the lane then got clear and stayed on with response. LETMENO tracked the pace along the inside then moved out a path and hustled up on
the far turn, brushed with foe entering top stretch then lacked strong closing response. LIFE ON TOP was unhurried and saved ground, headed in pursuit
and steadied along the rail late on the far turn then altered course to race widest and gained position. PLEASECALLMEBACK got bumped and steadied in
the first turn, raced near the back then launched a bid on the far turn, gained closer contention but failed to sustain. HOMBRAZO steadied nearing the first
turn then made contact with rival and steadied on the first turn, raced off the pace then six wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. PREFECT
raced off the pace, was ridden along two to three wide around the far turn and lacked the needed response to pose a threat. PATROL got bumped just after
the start, raced off the pace and saved ground, angled out and came under a ride but failed to move on. SMALL REASON got bumped just after the start
then bumped and steadied nearing the first turn, raced off the pace and offered no late bid. KID MERCURY vied for the lead down the backstretch then

Footnotes
NO WAY JOSE (IRE) secured inside position on the first turn then rated under slight restraint not far off the pacesetter, continued to save ground then
angled out and picked up the pace late on the far turn, was set down three to four wide upper stretch, responded sharply and kicked clear. CARIBA stalked
down the backstretch then moved up and took a slim lead at the quarter pole, continued to dig in with a narrow advantage at the furlong marker then could
not hold off the challenge from the winner. HEIR OF LIGHT took over the lead in the first turn then set the pace to the far turn, got headed near the quarter
pole but ran on and just lasted for a share. BERING STRAIT settled nicely while rated off the early pace, was ridden along two wide around the far turn,
came out wider under pressure, continued to steadily gain and just missed out on show. TAKE TEN raced off the pace and saved ground through the final
turn then shifted out wide for the drive and improved position. TEMPLE CITY TERROR raced near the pace then put to a drove five wide entering the lane
and passed tiring foes. MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT raced near midpack and had no kick when roused for response. ZABAVA raced off then pace then hustled
along six wide into the lane but lacked a needed rally. SWEET HITCH HIKER steadied nearing the first turn, saved ground while not too far off the early
pace but had no response when called upon. SERANITSA tracked between foes down the backstretch then urged along the inside on the far turn but failed
to move on. PAKHET steadied nearing the first turn, raced off the pace and offered no late bid. ALL QUALITY tracked the pace to the far turn then
weakened.
