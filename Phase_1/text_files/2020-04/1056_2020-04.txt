Footnotes
LEON'S DIAMOND bumped with a rival at the start, followed the early leader three wide to bid late backstretch and move clear then held a safe margin
under steady handling. PETE AND REPETE was four wide midpack early, moved inside going to the far turn, ran up heels of the lead pack and checked
nearing the lane, swung out and rallied but could not get to the winner. P R STREAKIN stalked the leaders from three wide and lacked a final closing bid
while holding position. PICKLES N ME saved ground and lacked a rally in the drive. TIZ A MAGIC MAN showed the most early speed to gain position about
the three path and weakened in the drive. P R WHY NOT bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground and failed to rally. TRIP CODE saved ground and
was not a threat. TERRIFIC JO floated wide into the first turn and was always back. LET'S HOPE was outrun racing three wide.

Footnotes
CHEVERIE showed good speed from the start to gain the inside leaving the first turn and make all the pace, drew off in the far turn and continued to widen
under steady handling. INNOCENT STORM moved up three wide outside the winner to bid into the far turn but could not go with that one the remainder.
RYRYSWEETIE chased the pace along the inside and weakened but regained position late. SPELL WINDER was four wide to move within reach going to
the far turn and wakened. HOLY MARIE was not a threat racing four wide. OUR ANABELLE followed the early pace three or four wide and weakened.
REMARKABLE CHARM saved ground and was always back. EMILY'S PEGASUS had the ground break from under her at the break and bobbled then
never threatened.

Footnotes
EATON'S MEMORY tracked the dueling leaders three wide early to bid in late backstretch, dueled outside MATAPAN through the far turn into the lane then
edged clear in the final sixteenth under steady handling. MATAPAN dueled on the early pace outside DIXIE FLYER, continued from between rivals as the
winner challenge in late backstretch, continued to duel into the lane but could not match strides late. DIXIE FLYER dueled from inside MATAPAN through
the opening half mile, continued inside and steadied along the rail leaving the quarter pole and could not go with the top pair late. The riders of both DIXIE
FLYER and MATAPAN lodged a claim of foul against the winner alleging interference leaving the quarter pole which was not allowed. CHUB'S CHARMER
saved ground back off the pace, moved closer through the far turn and angled out into the lane to close the gap on the show horse. LITTLE LOVE SHACK
was three wide and failed to mount a rally. STELLA MARIE chased the dueling leaders three and four wide to the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
WITT'S GOLD contested the pace inside BETA CAPO SONG while about the two or three path, kicked clear through the far turn then just lasted late as
DUKATI made a late run. DUKATI settled back off the pace three or four wide, swung out to rally five wide into the lane and responded with a good late run
to be rapidly getting to the winner. MR RED SENSATION settled two or three wide off the pace, rallied into the lane but could not reach the top pair.
JUNKERS stalked the pace from along the inside and made a mild rally. RESILIENCE OF LOVE tracked the pace from four wide and weakened in the
drive. BETA CAPO SONG was on the pace outside WITT'S GOLD to the far turn and came up empty in the drive. DANCE FOR RANSOM was not a threat.
DANCE EVEN followed the early pace three wide and tired.

Footnotes
EMERALD POINT stalked the pace four wide midpack, moved closer through the far turn to fan six wide into the lane and closed with a good late run to rally
clear. TRUE ALLEGIANCE moved up three or four wide to bid outside CASH TIZ WONDERFUL going up the backstretch, edged clear while floating out into
the lane, continued to drift upper stretch and could not handle the winner's late run. ATOKA GIRL stalked the pace four wide to bid outside TRUE
ALLEGIANCE from five wide into the lane, steadied and altered course inward as that rival drifted some more then could not hold position late.
INTOXICATING KISS rallied three wide through the far turn, swung out into the lane and closed belatedly to just miss the show. DISTINCT APPROVAL was
part of the early speed about the two or three path inside rivals and weakened. CASH TIZ WONDERFUL was hustled up outside DISTINCT APPROVAL to
contest the early lead, continued inside TRUE ALLEGIANCE to the far turn and had little left in the drive. FOXY TWIST saved ground just off the early pace
and tired. SIBLYLINE was four and five wide in the far turn and tired. REEL RED DOMINATOR was always back then bumped an injured rival pulling up
and unseated her rider but walked off under her own power. LINGERING SALLY suffered an injury in the stretch and was vanned off.

BIG HEARTED FACTOR saved ground just off the early leaders to come through inside rivals turning for home and move clear then held a safe margin
under steady handling. JOHN ARNOLD made the pace racing out about the two or three path, floated out further into the lane and could not handle the
winner's late run. DORCHEAT ZARB saved ground at the rear early, rallied through the far turn and gained clear for the show but could not reach the top
pair. RULETHENIGHT stalked the pace four wide, came five wide into the lane and could not produce the needed late rally. SERGIOS LIMONCELLO was
in reach four and five wide but failed to produce a closing bid. RISKY BOY tracked the leaders five wide and weakened in the far turn. MONEY BROKER
followed the pace four wide and weakened. HIDDEN GUN chased the pace three or four wide and tired. VALID PROSPECTOR saved ground and was
always back.

Footnotes
SLEEPY EYES TODD was on the early pace inside YO Y ME to edge clear in the second turn, drew off going to the final turn and continued on a daylight
lead under steady handling to the wire. BLUE HARBOR saved ground to make a run at the leaders through the second turn, rallied nearest the winner into
the lane but could not close the gap while holding the place. MR. TICKLE saved ground back off the early pace, angled out nearing the lane to rally four
wide and closed to miss second late. FIGHT ON followed the pace in good position three wide but failed to mount a threatening bid into the lane.
THETRASHMANSCOMING tucked inside to save ground early, moved out heading up the backstretch and improved position but could not threaten late.
PENDLETON tracked the pace four and five wide to make a bid going to the far turn but weakened. CABIN JOHN followed the early pace close up three or
four wide and tired in the final turn. ROCK CITY ROADHOG was five wide in the first turn, settled four wide and tired. YO Y ME prompted the early pace
outside the winner and tired.

Footnotes
SNEAKY MEEK stalked the pace four wide, moved closer as the field bunched going up the backstretch the second time, challenged outside HESABULLY
into the lane and moved clear late under steady handling. HESABULLY stalked the pace three wide to bid going up the backstretch, kept a head in front to
upper stretch and could not handle the winner late. BIGSHOT LACEWELL tucked inside to follow the pace, bid going up the backstretch but could not go
with the top pair. TED W chased the early leader three wide, bid going up the backstretch and weakened into the lane. AIR ASSAULT moved outside to gain
position three or four wide but could not threaten the final quarter mile. CLASSY COVE saved ground and failed to mount a solid bid. RENVYLE was not a
threat racing three wide. COUNT N GOLD showed the most early speed to cross over and make the early running about the three path then tired in the final
turn.
