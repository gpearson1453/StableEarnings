closing jump. TOPOFTHEMOUNTAIN sprinted off to a clear lead racing out about the three or four path, carried daylight lead into the lane then shied out
from the whip leaving midstretch and just failed to last. I'M A ROCK broke inward to bump with a rival, chased from four wide and could not threaten late. R
DUB was two and three wide and could not close the gap. NAIVASHA MONTANA was bumped and shuffled back at the break, saved ground and could not
threaten late. DOUBLEC'STWOPUNCH was outside and floated six wide into the lane. G MAN IS IN TOWN was bumped and shuffled back at the start then

Footnotes
ALICIA'SVALENTINE saved ground just off the early leaders to challenge through the far turn, moved clear into the lane then drifted through the stretch
while holding STELLA BESS safe. STELLAR BESS was squeezed back between rivals at the start then lacked any early speed, moved out in the second
turn to move up four and five wide, got nearest the winner into the lane but could not run that one down. OCTOBER WON followed the pace three or four
wide and moved up in the lane to gain minor honors only. WITTS MAMBO JACK tracked the pace from three or four wide to bid and move clear into the far
turn then could not sustain the move. GABY VEE stalked the pace three or four wide to move into contention going to the far turn but went evenly the
remainder and could not threaten. SOUTH CAROLINA contested the pace outside GONE INDIAN for a half and tired in the far turn. GONE INDIAN
contested the pace inside SOUTH CAROLINA for a half and tired.

Footnotes
FREE MUSIC showed the most early speed to gain inside position about the two or three path, was joined by LANGS LEGEND entering the turn, dueled
that one the remainder and kept safe to the end. LANGS LEGEND lunged at the break then rushed up outside the winner to challenge into the turn, dueled
that one the remainder and could not get by. DION was in reach of the leaders and went evenly and could not close late. BRONCO DAVE was nearest the
top pair along the inside and lacked a closing bid. PICADILLY ROADSTER was four and five wide, moved up in the drive but could not threaten late.
PROUD ITALIAN saved ground and failed to mount a bid. IN CONTROL lacked a rally three or four wide. WELL MANNERED was checked along the rail as
a rival came in through the opening furlong and was always back. BITSY'S CARLOS was four and five wide in the turn and weakened.

PICKELJUICE tracked the early leaders four wide to bid into the far turn and edge clear through that bend then held safe late. DRINKINANDTHINKIN saved
ground back off the early pace, angled out to rally four wide into the lane and closed but could not run down the winner. CHARED dueled on the lead about
the two path inside, JACK BE GOOD then went evenly in the lane to hold third. STORM DASH moved inside through the first turn and saved ground, angled
out to move four and five wide into the lane then could not threaten late. JACK BE GOOD was on the pace outside CHARED to the far turn, steadied turning
for home and weakened. The rider of JACK BE GOOD lodged a claim of foul against the winner alleging interference turning for home which was not
allowed. MINE FOR A SONG failed to mount a rally racing three wide. HUSKER RIDGE followed the pace four wide and tired. STEF'S GUY broke slow and
threw his head at the break then was always outrun while wide.

FRIENDLY AND KIND was on the pace inside STAR HUNTER to edge clear in the far turn, widened into the lane then held the margin under steady
handling. ATTITUDE AJUSTMENT showed early speed inside but was caught in a bit tight along the rail and steadied in the first turn, moved out three wide
then could only chase the winner home. A KISS GOODNIGHT dropped off the pace racing four wide, moved up and gained third late. STAR HUNTER
contested the early pace outside the winner and weakened. BRILLANT MIND was not a threat racing three wide. IRREPLACEABLE followed the pace four
wide and tired.

HOWS MY GOLD dueled on the pace inside ASDRUBAL through the opening half mile, edged clear in the far turn and held safe in the lane. ASDRUBAL
dueled outside the winner to the far turn and could not match strides in the drive. STALKER was along the inside to move up through the far turn but could
not get to the top pair in the lane. YOU'RE THE REASON stalked the leaders four wide and could not close the gap in the lane. PANENA TORNAI saved
ground to the backstretch, angled out to move four wide in the far turn but lacked a final closing bid. ALONEATTHEBAR failed to mount a bid three or four
wide. CLASSY AFFAIR was not a factor. ELUSIVE DREAM was near the early pace four wide and tired. LETS TANGO trailed throughout.
