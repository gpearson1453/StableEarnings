Footnotes
SEGISMUNDO, in touch with a rival attending the pace under light rating in the opening half, took over racing into the far turn and held sway on a
comfortable margin under firm encouragement. THE KAHN tracked the leaders three deep as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch and
continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others. WHAT A HOOT hopped at the start, quickly recovered to track the leaders between foes racing to
the backstretch, disputed second into the lane but had no final bid. UPPER CROWN, urged to the lead in the opening stages setting the pace ona narrow
margin racing a bit off the rail, dueled inside the eventual winner into the far turn, continued inside foes into the lane and faded late. FLEDERMAUS angled
to the inside early tracking just off the leaders, then gave way racing into the far turn. ATTACK ZONE was settled last and failed to menace.

Footnotes
LEMON WATER tracked the pace outside rivals as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep leaving the midway point of the
far turn advancing on the leaders, dueled for command with V K LEGACY past midstretch and edged forward late under firm encouragement. The latter
angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, shifted out advancing to challenge racing into the far turn, resisted the winner's
bid to late stages but came up second best. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, shifted out four wide
racing into the stretch and continued to make mild progress to gain a share. CHICA DIFISEL tracked off the second flight between foes, angled inside when
presented an opening racing into the far turn, was roused to advance inside foes through the stretch but was gathered up avoiding close quarters nearing
the wire. LILYS FROM PARIS broke slowly, was settled between foes, switched outside rivals racing four wide through the far turn, was fanned five wide
into the stretch and continued to gain position but was taken in hand nearing the wire. GET BACK HOME angled to the inside early while dropping well off
the leaders, saved ground throughout and made an effort to improve position. TWO STEP BEAT tracked off the second flight along the inside to the far turn,
shifted out three deep racing between foes into the lane but had no rally. ACTION ABSOLUTE DS proved no factor. COMMISSION urged to the lead while
angling to the rail, set the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and gave way. JOST DREAMY tracked inside foes just off the second flight to the
backstretch but was through after a half.

Footnotes
TIPSY AGAIN broke sharply, sped clear of the field setting the pace a bit off the rail, repelled challengers to regain a clear advantage racing into the turn
and held sway to the end under firm handling. DIAMOND NEWS tracked the pacesetter between foes in early stages, moved to close the gap between calls
nearing the turn, continued in pursuit of the winner through the bend while losing ground into the lane but edged a rival narrowly for the place honors. CHIT
CHAT GIRL tracked the pacesetter four wide, then three wide racing into the turn, couldn't gain terms with the winner and was outkicked for second.
GRAYCLIFF bobbled at the start, tracked off the second flight between foes, angled inside racing into the turn gaining some position, then shifted four wide
into the lane while finishing evenly. R LOVELY JULZ, restless in the gate, was steadied in traffic in the opening stages, angled to the inside nearing the lane
and continued with an even effort. TINK broke slowly, raced four wide tracking off the second flight but offered no rally. ROMANTIC GIZMO tracked the
pacesetter three between foes in the opening stages but faded early. COMMANDER OF DEATH tracked just off the first flight between rivals but soon
retreated. BAREBACK FUN raced along the rail just behind the second flight in the opening quarter and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
NOBLE INTENTIONS, held up avoiding close quarters nearing the first turn, shifted out three wide racing to the backstretch tracking the pacesetter from just
out of striking distance, continued with a steady bid in that path racing through the far turn to wrest command racing through the stretch and went clear
under firm right handed pressure. FINEST JEWEL sped clear while angling to the inside, held sway on a comfortable margin to the far turn, shifted off the
rail while being roused to resist the winner's challenge nearing the lane, proved no match for that rival but was best of the others. BIZNESS BEAUTY, rated
inside foes tracking off the second flight in the opening stages, gained position while shifting out racing into the far turn and split foes in the lane to gain
some position. PREMIUM MOTION was settled between foes racing to the first turn, shifted three deep splitting rivals nearing upper stretch, angled out four
wide in the lane and continued with interest while outkicked for a share. EYE ON THE FINISH, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter
in the opening half, shifted inside that foe while being urged to advance racing into the lane but steadily faded in the drive. BEACHTREASUREGIRL was
settled in the last flight early, was prompted to advance while being fanned five wide into the lane and made no impression. INCA PRINCESS, brushed at
the start, was held up avoiding tight quarters just after the break and failed to menace thereafter. PRINCESS BRIENNE, urged to gain a forward placing
while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, gave way between foes early. MILEY tracked the leaders three deep to the backstretch and never gained
contention. SHENU SHENUME tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening half, shifted out four wide nearing the lane and quickly came up
empty.

Footnotes
GONEASAGIRLCANGET broke readily to gain terms with the first flight three deep in the opening stages, conceded the lead while switching outside the
pacesetter in the opening quarter, continued with a steady bid to wrest command from that foe midway through the turn, then met the challenge of LANGUE
LIEE racing into the stretch, holding that rival under firm right handed pressure in a game performance to prevail. The latter raced in touch between foes in
the first flight in the opening furlong, was eased out to track just off the leaders racing to the turn, loomed three deep nearing upper stretch to challenge for
command, contested the issue to late stages but was just outkicked. UPPER CHARLIZE DS tracked off the second flight three deep between foes in early
stages, shifted inwards a bit on the turn and continued to gain position between foes while prevailing for a share. KATIE FALOONA tracked off the second
flight outside rivals in early stages, was prompted to advance while angling to the inside nearing upper stretch, continued along the rail late and was
outkicked for a share. SHE'S A FAIR CATCH stumbled badly at the start, was settled while collecting her stride and passed only tiring rivals into the stretch.
MOMENTS TO SAVER tracked the pace inside foes off the second flight, was shuffled a bit avoiding traffic racing into the turn and quickly came up empty.
TESSIE'S RED SOX, caught five wide in early stages, made brief pursuit of the leaders in that path to the turn and soon emptied out. CALL ME
MOONSHADOW was never a factor. LA CAFETERA tracked off the second flight between foes and emptied out early. MIGHTY ELECTRICA was hustled
outside foes to gain the lead, angled sharply to the rail once gaining the advantage, set the pace into the turn and gave way abruptly after a half. LADY
MIDAS dropped out early. SHIRBEL was urged inside foes prompting the first flight but emptied out after the opening quarter.

Footnotes
BARREL OF DESTINY was rated outside foes tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, shifted out to the four path
advancing on the pacesetter in tandem with several rivals to challenge for command four deep nearing upper stretch, continued to dispute the issue in a
prolonged drive past midstretch but narrowly prevailed in time under strong handling. MONKEY MIND tracked the pacesetter from just out of striking
position while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner to bid for command along the rail leaving the far
turn, shifted out while being roused to contest the issue in a long drive but came up second best. BETTER YET was settled in the last flight while angling to
the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn to advance four wide between foes into the lane but made belated progress to prevail for a
share. SHES DYNOMITE was hustled to the lead along the rail, set the pace on a clear margin into the backstretch, shifted a bit off the inside while being
roused to resist several challengers nearing upper stretch, was steadied out of tight quarters racing into the lane while angling back to the rail, regained
some position under pressure but weakened late. I DREAM OF LOIS angled to the rail in early tracking the leaders inside foes, shifted out gaining position
between foes racing into upper stretch but had no final kick. FUN PADDY was settled outside foes in early stages, was prompted to advance while being
fanned five wide into the lane and had no late response. ITSAGIMME'S GIRL, forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter in the opening half, was urged to bid
for command in tandem with the top pair three deep between foes nearing upper stretch but quickly emptied out. ASHLEY'S ROSE was never a factor.
CHOLLA tracked off the second flight racing three wide to the far turn and emptied out into the lane. CAPE LAA DI DA was rated along the inside tracking
the leaders in second flight but faded early.

Footnotes
DOUBLE DEEP, prominent three deep between foes from the outset, prompted the pace between foes in that path racing into the turn to gain a narrow
advantage, shook clear racing into upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm right handed pressure. AMELIA'S WILD RIDE angled inwards in the
opening stages tracking off the first flight between rivals, shifted out four wide midway through the bend to bid for command between foes nearing upper
stretch but couldn't match the winner in late stages while prevailing for second. THE GREAT LOUDINI, cut off and forced to check off rivals at the start, was
collected while dropping out last racing through the backstretch, split foes just off the inside to challenge inside the leaders leaving midstretch and continued
willingly to prevail for a share. JAIDEN'S BEST tracked just off the first flight outside foes in early stages, was urged to advance five wide between foes
nearing upper stretch to challenge for command in that path but was outkicked. BIG GILLETTE, bumped by STERLING GENERAL, then forced into THE
GREAT LOUDINI at the start, was settled outside foes racing to the turn and made an effort to gain some position in late stages. BACK PAGE, forwardly
placed five wide racing in touch with the first flight, was fanned six wide leaving the midway point of the turn and soon gave way. FORTY FATHOMS, urged
inside foes disputing the pace into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. STERLING GENERAL ducked inwards bumping BIG GILLETTE, forcing that rival
into THE GREAT LOUDINI at the start, angled to the inside tracking off the first flight in early stages and steadily faded into the lane. SOLITARY JACK, in
touch with the first flight four wide between foes racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue in that path racing into the turn and gave way abruptly
nearing the lane. IMA WILDCAT tracked just off the first flight inside foes but dropped out early.

Footnotes
CLEAR AS DAY broke readily, was rated inside rivals stalking just off the pacesetter into the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, advanced
along the rail in upper stretch to bid for command leaving the furlong furlong marker and just edged WINDFALL PROFIT nearing the wire under firm
handling. The latter came through close quarters, then was caught four wide racing through the first turn dropping off the second flight, commenced an early
move while shifting inwards after a half to prompt the pacesetter into the far turn, pressed the issue to late stages while striking the front between calls late
but couldn't contain the winner. TWIRLING STAR tracked off the second flight inside foes in early stages, gained position along the inside racing through the
far turn, switched out four wide in upper stretch to challenge for command but was outkicked. HEAVENLY PEACE settled along the inside in the opening
half, saved ground to upper stretch and made some belated progress. TEXAS PROMO GIRL moved readily to the fore while angling to the inside, dictated
the pace on a narrow margin under light rating to the far turn, shifted off the inside contesting the issue into upper stretch and gave way. GAELIC GOLD,
held up avoiding traffic in the opening stages, was settled outside foes to the backstretch and passed some tiring rivals late. SCREEN IMAGE tracked the
leaders three deep just off the second flight, made some brief progress in that path after a half but faded into the stretch. KITTEN EMPRESS, pulling against
restraint while caught in tight quarters early, continued between foes to the far turn but offered no rally. BOURBON REBELLION, forwardly placed outside
the pacesetter to the backstretch, faded after a half. TOURIST LIKE ME, caught in close quarters between rivals in the opening stages, was fanned wide
nearing the lane and gave way.
