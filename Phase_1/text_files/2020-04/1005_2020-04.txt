DELTA SURPRISE stalked the early pace, raced four wide in the stretch and finished well to be clear under strong handling. SAZERAC REMEDY stalked
the early pace, saved ground throughout and finished second best. I'M A STAR stalked the pace, raced three deep at the eighth pole and finished willingly
to the wire. OKLAHOMA CITY set all the pace from the inside and weakened a bit through the drive. SHAWN AGAIN settled off the early pace, saved
ground and had no response. W. G. WARRIOR was hustled from the outside to press early and tired. GRUFFANDTOUGH was slow early and never
threatened. MI SILVER HAZE dropped back early and failed to have a response. TIGER TREATS took up at the break, raced four wide in the lane and
never was a factor.

showed good early speed from the inside and just missed in a game effort. RAGAN'S JET stalked the pace, raced three wide in the stretch and kept on to
the wire. LADY LAURA stalked the leaders from the outside, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. STAR PRADO
stalked the pace and weakened while racing along the inside through the stretch. A FAST BROAD was unhurried early, moved up five wide at the eighth
pole and had no final winning bid. LATEJANA was slow early, raced three deep and never was a factor. PUSSYCAT PUSSYCAT settled off the early pace
and failed to have a response. SLIDAN dropped back early, raced three wide in the lane and had no response. TERRIS STRONG HOPE pressed the pace

Footnotes
NURSE LIST set all the pace and drew off in the drive to be well clear under strong pressure. HUSHED pressed the pace from the outside, raced just off the
inside and finished second best. KEANNA stalked the pace, saved ground and showed good late interest. DREAMING SILENT stalked the pace along the
inside and weakened. WHIMSICAL TALE settled off the early pace, saved ground and had no final winning bid. TOCDIRTYTOME raced four wide at the
eighth pole and had no late rally. EMILY ELIZABETH dropped back early and failed to respond. OH NO WATA stalked the pace, took up sharply at the three
eighths pole and tired in the drive. DARLING KINNA was slow early and never threatened. WHO'S FOOLING WHO failed to menace.
SKIPPERLITTTLEGIRL failed to sustain a bid. LETTER RIP was off slowly and never was a factor.
