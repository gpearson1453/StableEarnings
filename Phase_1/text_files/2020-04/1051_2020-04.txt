Footnotes
INDY RIDE, was held up out of close quarters in the opening stages to stalk behind the leaders racing through the backstretch, shifted outside those foes
leaving the midway point of the turn, advanced to challenge three deep entering upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear under a drive. PAPA
RALPH J was roused right handed in the opening stages to dispute the lead inside a rival racing through the backstretch into the turn, lost some ground to
that foe nearing upper stretch but kept on under pressure to prevail for the place honors in the closing stages. KHOLSTOMER broke readily to gain a narrow
advantage between calls, prompted the pace outside a rival racing to the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch but faltered in the
drive. RELISHMENT angled to the inside early dropping off the second flight, saved ground on the bend gaining position, shifted out three wide entering the
lane but had no late bid. ENJOY BASEBALL, caught five deep in the second flight racing into the turn, steadily faded nearing the lane. PURPLE MONSTER
broke readily to track just off the leaders three deep between foes through the backstretch and and emptied out midway through the turn. TEDDY'S HONOR
was a brief factor four wide between foes in second flight but dropped out early.

Footnotes
R CALLI KIM was rated between foes stalking just off the first flight racing through the backstretch, switched outside the first flight entering the turn, was
urged to advance four wide nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage to go well clear under pressure and was taken in hand nearing the wire. DRIVE
IN, in touch with the first flight inside foes stalking the pace under light rating in the opening stages, conceded some position racing into the turn, saved
ground through the bend, then switched out splitting foes three wide racing through the lane and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors late.
ETTAPLACE, in touch with the pacesetter between foes attending the pace under rating racing to the turn, was urged to challenge while angling to the rail
entering the turn, gained a brief advantage between calls nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. COSI MOMOSI tracked off the first flight between foes
in the opening half, swung out five wide racing into the stretch but offered no rally. BRYCENS GOLD attended the pace under rating racing four wide to the
turn, continued three deep between foes on the turn and gave way into the lane. ICY SWEET was settled along the inside early and failed to menace.
LEGAL IN CANADA proved no factor. CRACK OF DAWN broke readily to gain a narrow advantage, dictated the pace in hand three deep between foes to
the turn and gave out abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
JOHNNY U, in touch with the leader from the outset attending the pace under light rating, pressed the issue on the turn into upper stretch and prevailed
narrowly in a prolonged drive under firm right handed pressure. DRILL'S LI'L MAN was roused to the lead inside foes from the break, dueled for command
racing a bit off the rail in a protracted skirmish and grudgingly resisted the winner to the end. YABBA DABBA DUDE, held up off the first flight while angling
to the inside in the opening furlong, saved ground through the bend gaining position, switched out three wide racing through the lane and edged a rival for a
share. RESIDENT was settled last while shifting a bit off the rail racing to the turn, angled to the rail entering the stretch and continued with interest to gain
position late. EPIC DRAMA, forwardly placed three deep between foes in the opening stages, was caught in tight quarters leaving the half mile marker,
shifted inwards a bit to pursue the leaders between foes into the turn but faded entering the lane. NICK THE CARDSHARK raced four wide between rivals
stalking just off the first flight in the opening stages, was shuffled out of close quarters leaving the half mile marker, was prompted to advance four deep
nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. NORTHERN, caught five wide racing through the backstretch tracking just off the leaders, angled
nearer to the inside racing through the turn but steadily faded. AMELIA'S WILD RIDE, off a step slowly, never gained contention.

Footnotes
KONZA KANDY was rated out of striking distance inside foes tracking the leaders in the opening quarter, was prompted to advance along the rail racing into
the turn, came through tight quarters while being brushed entering upper stretch but wrested the advantage and went clear under firm right handed
pressure. PROPOSITION vied for the lead between foes in the opening stages, shifted nearer to the inside entering the turn disputing the the issue inside a
rival, dispatched that foe shifting out nearing upper stretch, brushed the winner while being roused to resist that foe entering the stretch but proved no match
late. OUR PROMISE tracked the leaders out of striking distance four wide in the opening stages, angled inwards nearing the lane and gained some position
between foes just off the inside while narrowly prevailing for a share. J'S INDIAN CHARM joined the pace three deep in the opening stages, pressed the
issue outside a rival racing into the turn, drifted out nearing upper stretch and gave way. ALL GOOD TIMES broke awkwardly, was reserved well back to the
turn, swung out five wide entering the stretch and made some belated progress. BLAZEN BETSY, in touch with the leaders nearest the inside in the opening
furlong, was eased back while shifting out to track off the first flight racing to the turn, angled to the rail racing into the stretch but steadily faded. TOTALLY
OBSESSED tracked the leaders from out of striking distance three deep between foes through the backstretch but dropped out early.

Footnotes
BUCKY'S DRAMA, brushed at the start, sped away to a clear advantage racing in the three path in the opening furlong, dictated the pace on a comfortable
margin remaining a bit off the rail through the turn and went clear through the stretch under brisk handling. MALIBEAUTY tracked the leaders outside foes
from just out of striking distance four wide through the backstretch, came under prompting to advance in that path racing into the turn, shifted out five wide
entering the lane and found some late response to prove best of the others. HALFINTHEWRAPPER, squeezed at the break, quickly recovered, was
switched outside the pacesetter pursuing that rival three deep racing into the turn, drifted out to the four path entering the lane and steadily faded. HONEY
MUG broke outwards bumping HALFINTHEWRAPPER, was collected while angling inside to track just off the pacesetter racig into the turn but faded
entering upper stretch. SILVER TUNES was settled out of striking distance while angling to the inside early but never mounted a serious challenge. GREY
WAVE broke slowly, switching well off the rail in early stages and raced wide throughout.

Footnotes
JOST DREAMY was settled well off the leaders while shifting nearer to the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance splitting foes four
wide leaving the midway point of the far turn, moved to challenge for command in that path leaving midstretch and took over late under firm left handed
encouragement. MOMENTS TO SAVER, held up off the second flight while angling inwards racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep entering the far
turn while being urged to split foes, was caught in tight quarters momentarily midway through the bend, split foes, then angled inside the leaders in upper
stretch to bid for command along the rail and proved best of the others. KATIE FALOONA, shuffled back out of tight quarters at the start, was settled last to
the backstretch, shifted out nearing the lane to split foes three wide, then shifted out five wide in the closing stages while gaining a share nearing the wire.
MIGHTY ELECTRICA was urged to the lead while angling inside racing to the first turn, set the pace on a clear margin to upper stretch shifting off the rail
but gave out late. I AM A. LURING was roused to contend between foes racing to the first turn, shifted out tracking just off the second flight on the
backstretch, was roused to advance three wide on the far turn to the lane and continued evenly between foes late. VUYELWA tracked off the second flight
along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground throughout but had no late response. MOR BREEZE, urged to a forward placing three deep racing to the
backstretch, tracked the pacesetter outside a rival for a half, was urged in pursuit of the pacesetter through the far turn to upper stretch and gave out nearing
the furlong marker. GRANDMARY switched outside foes racing off the second flight to the backstretch, was caught four wide racing into the far turn, was
fanned five wide nearing upper stretch and steadily retreated. UPPER CHARLIZE DS, caught four wide racing to the backstretch, never gained contention.
MIGHTY FROSTY, urged along pursuing the pacesetter along the inside to the backstretch, was spent after a half.

Footnotes
CANDY COVE broke readily to gain a forward placing, was rated conceding some position racing into the backstretch to track the leader between foes in
the opening half, steadily advanced on his own courage to close the gap nearing the far turn, took over leaving the midway point of the second bend to go
clear nearing upper stretch and came under right handed pressure through the lane to extend the advantage. TIZ SAMURAI tracked the pacesetter three
deep as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady effort in that path into the far turn and prevailed for the place honors
while never a match for the winner. BRANDT tracked just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch
while contesting second and prevailed for a share. JIMMY D, off slowly, settled well off the leaders, angled out four wide racing into the stretch and
continued with interest to improve position. DAS DA ONE sprinted clear along the rail racing to the backstretch, held sway to the far turn, couldn't meet the
winner's bid and gave out racing into upper stretch. BUZZ OFF was a brief factor inside rivals in second flight tracking the pacesetter into the backstretch
but gave way after a half. TACTICAL QUALITY proved no factor.

Footnotes
WILD WIGGLIN JACK, forwardly placed inside foes while shifting off the rail to track just off the pacesetter into the turn, was prompted to advance along the
rail racing into upper stretch to bid for command inside the leader approaching the furlong marker, then wrested the advantage and went clear under right
handed pressure. TARTAN THE BULL sped to the lead outside foes in the opening furlong, angled inwards to dictate the pace on a narrow margin racing a
bit off the rail racing into the turn, resisted the winner's challenge racing past midstretch but proved only second best. VENEZUELAN WARRIOR, pinched
back at the start, was quickly righted, then angled inwards to track just off the second flight between rivals, was prompted to split foes entering the turn to
advance three wide to upper stretch, couldn't gain terms with the top pair but prevailed for a share. KARMA KING, restless in the gate, was settled along the
inside in early stages, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position inside foes to the end. DOUBLE DEEP, held up just off the
second flight in early stages, shifted out four wide racing into the turn but offered no rally. ROCKYSBUCKAROO broke outwards bumping VENEZUELAN
WARRIOR, was settled outside foes racing through the backstretch and failed to menace. SMOKY BLUES, forwardly placed between tracking just off the
pacesetter under light rating racing through the backstretch, continued under pressure into the turn and gave way in the drive. CALL ME HANDSOME,
caught in tight quarters at the start, was rated just off the second flight three, then four wide racing through the backstretch and gave way racing into the
turn.
