Footnotes
D L'S GIRL broke in front and made the pace while pressed racing about the two or three path, edged clear through the far turn then held safe in the lane.
WITTS DATA LINK was just off the pace while two or three wide, found herself bottled up in traffic through late backstretch and the far turn then could not
run down the winner once clear. GOODNESS CAT was along the inside just off the pace, was caught in tight along the rail in the far turn and checked then
lost ground but was able to narrowly gain third. TICKER moved up four wide to bid into the far turn but could not sustain the run. ITYBITYQUIKASAKITY
forced the pace outside the winner to the far turn and weakened nearing the lane. ENGLISH TOFFEE was not a threat. SWEET AS CARO followed the
pace four wide and tired. EYES ON BEHOLD broke into the side of the gate to get away last then floated wide into the first turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
ZYXYZ was on the early pace between rivals, continued inside DIRTY DIXIE ROAD through the far turn to edge clear into the lane then just lasted as that
one rallied back late. DIRTY DIXIE ROAD forced the early pace outside rivals, continued with the winner through the far turn then rallied back late to
narrowly miss. TA KELA WARNING moved up three and four wide through the far turn then could not get to the top pair late. MONGOL CALL was in reach
racing two or three wide but lacked a final closing run. SILVER'S SWAN SONG moved up four and five wide into the lane but could not threaten late.
SIBLYLINE contested the early lead along the inside and weakened. EMMY GOT EVEN failed to mount a bid racing two or three wide. ODACHI was always
back racing three wide.

UBETCHA IMA BUMPER stalked the early pace from four wide, moved to the leader in the far turn to bid clear three wide turning for home then held safe
under steady handling in the drive. CHAMBER DOORS stalked the leaders from just off the rail, tucked inside through the fa turn and rallied in the drive to
gain clear for the place but could not get to the winner. POSSIBLY IN LOVE moved to a clear lead racing about the two or three path, made the pace to the
far turn and had little left in the drive. MINE FOR A SONG saved ground and lacked a rally. JAMACIAN ME MONEY was not a factor racing three wide.
TREPI'S TRPL CROWN followed the pace three or four wide and weakened. HOLD FAST KAT was always back racing two and three wide.

PERFECT GRAYDAR broke inward, tracked the leaders three wide, angled inside turning for home and rallied to gain the place late. PERFECT LINE
dueled outside the winner to midway of the turn then could not hold position in the drive. EMMA'S LOGIC was squeezed back between rivals at the start,
rallied inside on the turn and gained position but could not threaten late. DA VAN GEAUX saved ground and improved position while not a threat late.
HANDSOME DEPUTY went evenly racing four wide. DIALED was near the early pace and weakened four wide. BUMPY GAME weakened three wide.
AIN'TSEENTHEBALL was always back. TOPOFTHEMOUNTAIN was five and six wide in the turn and tired.

Footnotes
MADDY'S PRO moved up four wide leaving the first turn to bid outside leaders up the backstretch, moved clear in the far turn and held safe through the
lane under moderate urging. WITT'SDOLLARNIGHT came in several yards after the break to cause congestion, rallied inside through the far turn and
closed in the lane but could not reach the winner. I'M LUCKY was on the early pace inside a rival while about the two or three path, continued inside the
winner through the far turn and went evenly in the lane. I CALL SHOTGUN stalked the leaders four wide and lacked the needed late rally in the drive. E LEE
was in tight between rivals and squeezed back several yards after the start, rallied three wide in the far turn then angled in turning for home then could not
get to the top ones late. RAIN RAY saved ground and lacked a rally. ONE KIND OF CRAZY was not a threat. BLUEGALE was always back racing four to
five wide. DRAMA COACH rushed up four wide to contest the early pace and tired. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE EARLY PORTION
OF THE RACE, WITT'SDOLLARNIGHT WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FIFTH FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN THE OPENING SIXTEENTH OF
THE RACE.

final turn, moved well clear then kept safe in the lane under steady handling. OUT OF PATIENCE saved ground to rally heading up the backstretch and get
nearest the winner through the far turn then closed mildly but could not run that one down. BANJO BILL dueled from about the three path inside DANCE

wide in reach but lacked a final closing bid. DANCE FOR RANSOM dueled on the early pace outside BANJO BILL and tired in the final turn. STREET

opening half and had nothing left. HONEY HEARTS dueled on the lead outside LIVELY SPELL and had nothing left. SMART RACHEL saved ground and
was outrun. RACEY REECEY tired.
