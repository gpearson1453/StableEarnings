Footnotes
CHINOMADITO was shuffled back on the rail early, went along unhurried around the turn as a hotly contested pace developed, came wide for the drive and
wore down the leaders from outside on the wrong lead. HANDSOME PRINCE vied outside early, continued battling up front outside EL PILLO around the
turn and into the stretch, drifted out through the furlong grounds, then lugged in late. EL PILLO pressed the early pace between rivals, dueled inside
HANDSOME PRINCE around the turn and into the stretch, and weakened late. QUEEN'S MASON was forwardly placed throughout, and lacked room
behind HANDSOME PRINCE in deep stretch. UNION LINE hopped at the break and was off slow, lost ground around the turn in the three-path, moved to
the far outside for the drive and gained mildly. JACK EL BARBARO raced four wide around the turn, and faded in the stretch. ISLAND SONG stayed close
to the stretch in the two-path, and tired late. GABLE PASS brushed the left side of the gate and was off slow, and was outrun. BROTHER AARON had early
speed inside, gave way on the turn, and was eased up late.

TOONIE LOONIE set the early pace inside, shook off pursuers around the turn, and stayed well clear under pressure. QUEEN LETIZIA broke outward and
was away last, raced four wide around the turn, and wore down SOCIALLY ASTRAY from outside to get second. SOCIALLY ASTRAY chased after the
pacesetter three wide early, moved inside around the turn, and was outfinished for the place. AZNAVOUR raced three wide on the turn, and posed no
threat. LEISHLANICK saved ground in range for three furlongs, and faded steadily. WICKET HOPE was always outrun. TRINNI SUNSET was outrun
throughout. ABOVE PAR pressed the early pace between horses, and retired on the turn.

Footnotes
R KISS EM GOODBYE hustled up early to press the pace, took over outside BELLADONNIA near the five-sixteenths, drew well clear and was kept to
pressure on the wrong lead. SAY ADIOS chased three wide from the outset, finished willingly but could not menace the top one. ABARRIO FOREVER
raced in the middle of the pack around the turn three wide, and offered a mild response outside. BAHAMIAN GIRL bumped lightly with BEATING THE
ODDS at the start, and was no threat inside. BELLADONNIA crossed over inside briefly clearing to the early lead, could not hold off R KISS EM GOODBYE
on the turn, and gave way through the lane. MADAME BARRISTER broke out a bit at the start, raced four wide on the turn and tired. BEATING THE ODDS
bumped lightly with BAHAMIAN GIRL at the start, and was outrun inside. QUIET ALL AROUND was finished early three wide, and vanned off after the
finish. SUZIE ITS YOU trailed well out in the track and showed nothing.

Footnotes
JEANA'S GEM hustled up outside rivals early, took over around the turn in the two-path, remained clear to deep stretch, weakened late and was saved by
the wire. TARA advanced three wide midway on the turn, made little headway on the leader under a drive outside the quarter-pole, kept on determinedly
through the lane and just missed between horses. INDEPENDENT MISS bumped with THISSMYTIME at the start, improved position three wide
approaching the stretch, and was gaining too late outside the top pair. STARSHIP VOYAGER vied inside early, could not stay with JEANA'S GEM around
the turn, remained prominent along the rail into the stretch, and weakened. THISSMYTIME bumped with INDEPENDENT MISS at the start, saved ground
and failed to threaten. GOODBYE GABY showed early speed between horses, and dropped back into the turn. GITANA was outrun inside. SMOOTH AS
GLASS was done early three wide. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW showed nothing at the back.

Footnotes
KAUFY BEAN was at the back of a closely-bunched group early, swept to command on the far outside around the turn, drew off well out in the track and
was driving to stay clear. WILD MEDAGLIAD'ORO stayed close early while off the inside, was roused past the three-eighths advancing while being taken
well out in the track, and finished willingly on the wrong lead outside the winner. MOZO BELLO raced four wide around the turn, and ran on well enough to
gain a share well behind the top two. AZRAEL challenged for command outside TOTONO into the turn, but weakened before completing six furlongs.
TOTONO was sent hard to the lead inside early, and faltered before reaching the stretch. UNLOCKTHEPOTENTIAL was prominent early three wide, faded
around the turn and dropped far back.

BEYOND GONE was away in good order and raced just off the early leader, moved up three deep to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, battled on
with a slight edge over KW CAPTAIN HOOK mid-stretch then moved away under a driving finish. K W CAPTAIN HOOK broke last and came under right
handed whip action out of the gate but lacked early kick, saved ground and steadily advanced into close contention, lodged a rail bid approaching the
quarter pole, vied for the lead with BEYOND GONE mid-stretch then failed to kick on with the winner. AIN'T WASTING TIME raced five wide early on then
hustled up between foes mid-way on the turn, came out wide under a left handed drive in stretch run and secured show. UNCAPTURED KING raced in the
last flight then put to a drive racing wide in the stretch and improved position without threatening. TRAVELIN GAMBLER raced six wide early, worked
forward into closer contention around the turn then flattened racing wide in the lane. NORTHBROOK raced in the back then hustled along wide into the
stretch and lacked a needed rally. CAPTURED BY FATE sped to the lead and led the way into the turn, came under attack from a duo at the quarter pole
and gave way. SARASOTA BOY showed early response then faded on the turn.

Footnotes
ERV'S WENCH vied for the lead with FEELING FUNNY in the opening quarter, shook clear and widened to a commanding margin into upper stretch and
stayed sharp under steady pressure. MARKET RUMOR raced in the back along the inside in the opening quarter, picked up the pace midway down the
backstretch and advanced into closer contention, angled out on the turn then continued a steady outside bid through the lane. PARIS LIGHTS rated while
not far back, worked forward racing four deep on the turn then continued a wide bid through the lane and cleared the rest. YOU'RE THE BEST raced two to
three wide in range, coaxed three deep midway on the turn then dropped back. SNEER showed early response then came up empty on the turn.
THOMASVILLE retreated near the half mile marker. SECOND GRACE was not too far back in early stages then dropped back. FEELING FUNNY broke
readily, vied for the lead with the winner through early stages then retreated.

RODDICK was quick to the lead and saved ground around the first turn, set the pace by a comfortable advantage down the backstretch, challenged by
MORNING STRIDE past the three eighths pole, dueled inside of rival into stretch, battled on gamely, exchanged nose bobs and prevailed in final nod.
MORNING STRIDE was well positioned sitting off the top two leaders under a light rating, picked up the pace late backstretch and challenged RODDICK for
the lead past the three-eighth pole, dueled two wide through the lane, fought on gamely and got nipped in final stride. GREAT KAHUNA was positioned as a
strong contender down the backstretch then weakened off the top pair around the turn and stayed on for a share. YEAR OF THE KITTEN raced near the
inside in early stages then three to four wide upper stretch and failed to move into contention. MANHATTAN PROJECT was reserved and wide then angled
inside and saved ground to no avail. COULD BE bobbled at the start, raced off the clear trio in early stages then dropped back.

HOP KAT tracked up close along the inside, remained forwardly placed and angled out on the turn, came under strong left handed drive top of the lane,
shifted out wider, chased on determinedly in pursuit for DOUBLE CROWN and wore down rival in late stages. DOUBLE CROWN raced six wide positioned
off the second flight, was forced to steady to avoid loose horse past the half mile marker, lost momentum then hustled up late turn, continued a wide bid in
stretch run, steadily gained and captured place. JAKE ROCKS led the way through early stages and held firm over challenger's around the turn, continued
with the advantage in the final furlong, kept on determinedly then got wore down in final stages. ABSOLUTE GRIT steadied slightly in early stages,
continued a bid in contention while three deep at the quarter pole then failed to sustain bid in the lane. TOMATO BILL pressed the pace in the opening
quarter, remained forwardly position around the turn then gave way. SARASOTA COUNTY hopped then was awkward in stride and got away slowly at the
start, raced near the inside early, shifted out on the turn and failed to threaten. MILES AHEAD raced in the last flight then checked to avoid fallen rival past
the half mile marker and never reached contention. OURNATIONONPARADE clipped heels past the quarter pole and lost the rider, ran loose then corralled
by the outrider and walked off after the race. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY LOOKING INTO THE RUNNING OF #7 WHICH RESULTED IN NO

Footnotes
INCONVEYANCE led the way entering the first turn then briefly conceded position to MAJOR SWARTZY, moved back up and set a pressured pace down
the backstretch, vied for the lead with JACK BEANSTALK around the far turn and continued to battle back with a slight edge in the final furlong, fought back
gamely under pressure, dug in between foes in final strides and just lasted. CONSILIUM was reserved racing the back, made a good move along the rail
saving ground while rival's went wide on the far turn, continued a solid bid up the inside and was inching up to the winner approaching the wire. JACK
BEANSTALK stalked down the backstretch then advanced to challenge INCONVEYANCE on the far turn, dueled for the lead into stretch, battled on gamely
from the outside position, appeared all out in final stages, stayed on stubbornly but lacked the needed kick to get by. EXPRESS BOY settled off the pace
while racing widest down the backstretch, hustled up entering the far turn then raced wide into the lane and steadily edged up closer to the wire.
INDIRECTLY tracked the pace to the far turn, came under a ride nearing the quarter pole, raced in close contention then flattened out in the lane.
QUEEN'SPLATE NOLAN rated near mid-range down the backstretch and had no response when called upon in the final turn. FLUG was forwardly placed
through early stages, raced in striking range late backstretch then faded on the turn. DRY LAND rated between foes mid-stretch then soon dropped out.
BREAKAWAY ROMANCE raced near the back and failed to move into contention. MAJOR SWARTZY showed brief speed then dropped back, eased up in
the lane and walked off.
