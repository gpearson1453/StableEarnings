Footnotes
APPLE COUNTY bobbled at the break, stalked the early pace, made a good seven wide bid through the stretch and just got up under strong handling.
BREW CASA stalked the early pace, was bothered nearing the three eighths pole by the loose horse, raced six wide at the eighth pole and finished gamely
to the wire. LADY ABIGAIL pressed the pace from the outside, led into the stretch and weakened in the final stages. FINAL DESIGN settled off the early
pace, was forced to take up in the early stages due to the loose horse, raced towards the inside throughout and never was a factor. NURSE LIST showed
good speed from the outside and gave way. MORO COMPASS dropped back early, raced four deep through the stretch and never was a factor. SMOKIN'
CAROL was allowed to settle and failed to have a response. REESEY PEESEY raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. CAMP
WASHITA stumbled at the break and unseated his jockey.

Footnotes
LINDANTE pressed the early pace, gained command along the inside and drew off to be well clear late under steady handling. STEPHEN'S ANSWER
pressed the pace, raced four wide through the lane and was no match for the winner. DEEP EXPLORER raced five wide around the first turn, moved up
three wide in the stretch and made a mild late bid. SEATTLE THUNDER stalked the pace while saving ground and had no final winning bid. HOLIDAY
MISCHIEF was slow early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. TOWARDS THE LIGHT stalked the pace and tired. THORPE D'ORO raced five
wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. A P'S BLUEGRASS raced six wide around the first turn, moved up five wide at the quarter pole and never
was a factor. UNCAIL failed to threaten.

stalked the leaders , raced three wide while racing between through the far turn into the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. LUCKY LIZA ANN was off
slowly, moved up along the rail in the lane and gained ground gamely late. MIZONEY was allowed to settle early, angled six wide through the lane and
finished willingly to the wire. LOS SUENOS pressed the pace from the inside and tired. CHIRON ECLIPSE showed good early speed and gave way while
racing off the inside. SEBASTIANNA dropped back early, raced six deep at the eighth pole and never was a factor. MAYDAY'S PARADE stalked the pace
and tired. SO SO SAUCEY raced back in the early stages, drifted to the seven path in the stretch and never was a factor. RAT A TAT TAT failed to have a
response. PULPIT'S PRINCESS showed little. GOSPEL TRUMPY ANN raced far back and never was involved.

Footnotes
COUNTRY DAISY was allowed to settle early, moved up along the inside through the far turn into the lane and finished gamely to get under strong
encouragement. SPRING STEEN showed good early speed from the inside, dug nearing the sixteenth pole while racing just off the inside but couldn't hold
off the winner late to finish second best. FIDDLERS TSUNAMI stalked the pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire. LADY
ORCHID settled off the early pace, raced six wide into the upper stretch and showed good late interest. SHE'S SHINEY dropped back early, raced five deep
into the lane and had no final winning bid. THREE CHORDS stalked the early pace, raced towards the inside and had no late response. DICEY raced four
deep through the lane and had no rally. LIL FOOTNOTES raced six wide through the stretch and never was a factor. RUNAROUND ROSEY showed good
speed and way in the drive. HIGH CLASS EURO was off a step slow and never threatened.

finished willingly to the wire. RIDE TO THE WIRE took up at the break, moved up seven wide at the eighth pole and finished willingly late. GINGE stalked
the pace while saving ground, shifted two wide in the lane and had no final winning bid. EUROBADGUY raced towards the inside and had not enough late.

the drive. STARWARD failed to respond. MAJOR PERFECT raced three wide at the quarter pole and never was a factor. DIAMONDANDSTRIPES stalked
the pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and weakened. ROCK PACHE pressed the pace and tired readily.
