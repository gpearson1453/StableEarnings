SHALLOW RIVER vied for the early lead from the inside and held gamely to prevail under strong handling. NOCTURNAL MISSION pressed the pace, raced
four wide at the eighth pole and finished second best. QUIET SPRING was allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground and had no final winning bid.
GOLDEN LULLABYE pressed the pace while racing between and weakened a bit through the drive. LOVE AND LEMONS was unhurried early, raced four
wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. SHE'S GOT MOXY dropped back early, saved ground and never threatened.

LONG RIDE HOME set all the pace from the outside, built a clear lead in the lane and held gamely under a steady hand ride. MISS LEARJET was allowed
to settle early, moved up six wide at the eighth pole and made a good late rally. MADISON'S PLACE stalked the pace, raced four wide in the lane and had
no final winning bid. FLAT OUT PHAT was unhurried early, raced three wide through the far turn into the lane and had not enough in the drive. FLAT
PRECIOUS pressed the pace from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. BLING SPRINGSTEEN settled off the early pace, saved ground and
never was a factor. DREAMING SILENT stalked the pace from the outside and weakened. RESTORE HARMONY was unhurried early, made a middle
move to stalk the leaders, raced four wide at the eighth pole and weakened thereafter. ROSE LARUE dropped back early and failed to have a response.
KEENE'S PROMISE raced far back and never threatened.

VERONICA'S DREAM stalked the early pace, moved up four wide into the lane and finished well to get up under strong handling. ANGEL'S CUT showed
good early speed from the inside, dug in late but couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish second best. GIVEN KISSES pressed the early pace,
race between rivals through the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. ECO STAR stalked the early pace, raced three wide through the stretch and had no
final winning bid. WHEW was slow early, moved up three wide through the stretch but didn't have enough. SHE'S GOT FRIENDS dropped back in the early
stages, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. EMILY'S PEGASUS settled in the early stages, raced towards the inside and never
was a factor. SHA BLUSH failed to have a response.

Footnotes
DAISY CAN stalked the pace, raced two wide in the lane, raced in bit tight with heavy traffic at the eighth pole, found room along the inside and just got up
under all out pressure. BATTLE CHIC stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide into the lane, surged late and just missed in a game effort.
LEIGHTON KENTUCKY pressed the pace raced just off the inside and finished willingly to the wire. COLLEGE QUEEN was allowed to settle early, moved
up five wide in the lane and made a good late rally. CASTANUELA (MEX) stalked the pace along the inside and weakened a bit through the drive. MY
HOLIDAY settled off the early pace, raced four wide through the lane and never was a factor. AMOUR dropped back early, raced along the inside through
the far turn into the lane and never threatened. TOUR ON failed to have a response. QUIET FLATTERING sprinted clear and was empty in the drive.

Footnotes
WHOLEHEARTED stalked the pace along the inside, angled four wide nearing the eighth pole, finished well and was clear late under strong
encouragement. DRIP BREW set all the pace from the outside, led nearing the sixteenth pole but couldn't match strides with the winner late. IMA
DISCREET LADY pressed the pace, raced two deep and finished willingly to the wire. SHE'S SHINEY was allowed to settle in the early stages, saved
ground and had no final winning bid. ESTILO FEMENINO was slow early, raced four wide into the upper stretch, improved her position but never was a
serious threat. SPRING STEEN raced five deep into the lane and had no response. LADY ORCHID failed to have a response. BRAVE DAISEY failed to
sustain a bid while racing three deep.
