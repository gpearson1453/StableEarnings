Footnotes
NAPILI broke alertly, raced in the second flight outside, advanced three wide to challenge turning for home, protracted stretch duel while off the inside,
proved best under firm handling. RUN BALLERINA with the pace from the start off the inside, dueled through the turn in the two path, put that rival away
exiting the turn just as the winner was challenging from the outside, responded and raced on equal terms with that one to the wire in a stubborn effort. FIVE
QUEENS alternated up front closest to the inside, could no match the top two in the drive, narrowly saved the show. HALF SCOUT within striking distance
while three wide into the turn, two path into the lane, set down with a brisk left handed stick upper stretch, lost whip a furlong out, missed third. SAILAWAY
AND HIDE went one paced throughout toward the inside in lacking a closing response. ELUSIVE SECRET void of speed, worked way out to be three wide
into the stretch, improved position without posing a serious threat. WILL B LATE raced back off the early pace, three wide into stretch, lacked serious bid.
LINE OF FAITH settled in mid pack outside, four out to five wide turning into the stretch, lacked a closing response. SPOT'S MAINE GIRL broke inward and
slowly, continued to race sluggishly in trailing for a half while saving ground, passed tiring rivals. BONITA'S GOLD raced back, four wide into the stretch,
failed to muster a rally. EXPANSIONIST flashed brief speed along the inside, faded. LUCK'S GOOD GIRL tired while racing four wide through the turn.

Footnotes
FOREIGN EXCHANGE in the second flight early while between foes, advanced into contention three wide late in the turn, outside bid entering the stretch,
long drive, determined. STALEMATE behind the pace along the inside, continued to be patiently handled through the turn, advanced and challenged along
the inside upper stretch, dueled to the wire, outfinished, clearly second best. FRONTIER WOMAN lacked speed, raced three wide through the turn, shifted
out a bit for room when straightened for home, finished willingly to catch entrymate for the show spot. VIOLENT SPEED void of early foot out in the strip,
steered out to be six wide into the stretch, finished well down the middle of the strip while too late. HEART RIVER last away, five wide out of the turn,
improved position. LIL RED VETTE went one paced throughout, never dangerous. BIG AFFAIR broke on top, showed the way while in the three path up the
backstretch, two path turn, weakened when headed by the winner upper stretch. CONTENDRESS remained always back in failing to threaten. SYMPHONY
HALL went evenly in lacking a late response. MS BIG SPRING failed to menace while four wide through the turn. TRIPLE BOLD BABY pressed the pace
toward the inside for a half and gave wawy.

Footnotes
MI BELLA broke well, continued with the first flight while between foes, continued to vie into the far turn, dueled upper stretch, led late, enough left to hold
the runner up safe late. SACRED UNION lacked early foot, in some traffic when beginning to advance midway on the second turn, dropped inside late in
that bend, steered out a bit for the drive and finished up willingly to be getting to the winner in the final strides. ADDI in the second flight inside early, raced in
the two path through the second turn, allowed the runner up the inside into the lane, set down for the drive, moved out, displayed a moderate amount of late
interest to capture the show. SHACKADELIC broke alertly, narrowly set the pace along the inside, dueled with the winner past the furlong marker then
began to weaken. GYPSY WIFE void of speed off the inside after breaking a step slow, five wide out of the final turn, improved slightly upper stretch then
flattened out. BROADWAY BURN bothered into the first turn when four wide, continued to race outside, four wide through the final turn, lacked bid drive.
UNBURNT bothered to be off slowly, steadied in the first turn, remained back. HOUSE DRUNK broke out, raced back off the pace, got out into the first turn,
wide onto the backstretch, four to five wide second turn, remained back. ENGLISH ESCORT forced the pace while racing outside, three wide into the far
turn, gave way soon after. GREAT IN RED raced in mid pack early, began a steady fade after a half.

Footnotes
MIA PROMESSA in the second flight while in the two path, collared the leader inside the furlong marker, held the runner up safe late under brisk handling.
OUR GIRL ABBY in the main body toward the inside, asked along into the lane, steered out a bit for room approaching the furlong marker, slowly getting to
the winner late. ALL FACT back off the pace while racing outside, three out to four wide exiting the turn, rallied to be up for the show. MY DARLING SOFIA
in the second group early along the inside, fell back a bit through the turn continuing inside, moved off the rail a bit for the drive, finished up evenly while
between horses at the wire. R MARIE broke sharp, quickly sprinted well clear, continued to hold a sizable advantage through the turn and into upper stretch,
faltered when confronted in deep stretch. OUR SLICK CHICK lacked speed, raced four wide through the turn, lacked a closing punch when called on for the
drive. CAN'T TOUCH ME off a step slow, trailed early, raced three wide through most of the turn, improved upper stretch then flattened out. HONOR WITH
PRIDE back off the early pace toward the rail, angled out to be four wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally. DESPINA void of speed despite being asked
early, trailed through the turn, three wide into the lane, passed some faltering rivals while never a threat. DYNAMITE DAUGHTERS off a step slow,
remained always back. CLOSE TO ME off a step slow, raced four wide through the turn and tired. ALMYRA chased the leader for three furlongs in the three
path and stopped.

step slow, raced back, moved out four wide to advance through the turn, could do little with the top two the final furlong, lasted for the show. LITANY also
broke slowly, trailed well back for three furlongs, steered out to be four wide late in the final turn, finished willingly while remaining well out in the strip, too
late. BARINGER SPRING raced back, angled out four wide late in the turn, staged a mild rally while not a serious threat. JERRY'S GOT ACES settled off
the early pace, moved closer with a three wide move through the turn then flattened out in the drive. GOOD SUGAR saved ground to no avail. COOL EDGE
closest to the winner in the early going off the inside, tiring when dropped to the rail late in the turn, continued to retreat through the stretch. GUMWRAPPER
settled off the pace toward the inside, failed to muster a response in the drive. BIG BAD BUD settled in mid pack early, gave way in the drive. WILSHIRE
DIAMOND steadied in the early going behind some traffic, fell back. ROCKET STRIKE void of speed, tired while racing three wide.

Footnotes
SING HIM A SONG broke well from along the inside, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch and through the turn, shook off the other speed when
straightened for home and maintained a comfortable advantage through the lane while under steady handling. BURCIAGA pressed the issue from outside
the winner for a half, could not keep up in the drive, held sway for the place spot late. AIR POWER void of speed in trailing for a half, swung out six wide for
the drive, finished with good energy to be getting to the runner up late. TRE LEE DIVINE forwardly placed on the far outside, five wide into the turn, four
wide exiting had little left for the final furlong. GUSKA MON SHOES in the second flight while three wide into the turn, called on for the run to the wire, came
up empty. SNAGGLETOOTH in mid pack early, angled out to be four wide turning for home, also was found lacking when the real running began at the
head of the lane. HERE'S CARLOS bumped to be last away, raced well back, came five wide into the stretch, finished up willingly. IT IS DEJAVU bumped
foe start, made little impact off the inside. PRESIDENT ELECT remained always back. FAMILY CODE was finished after a half. CEEKY in the second flight
while four wide entering the turn, sotpped in the drive.

Footnotes
DACK JANIEL'S broke alertly, dueled up front closest to the rail, shook off the other speed to be clear into the lane, garnered a larger advantage past the
furlong marker, no threatened in the late going under steady handling. ORO DE TEJANO in the second flight while outside, continued three wide the middle
half, crept a bit closer to the winner while remaining in the three path late in the final turn, could do little else with that rival the final furlong, remained clear
for the place. WICKED INDEED void of speed while saving ground, improved position to finish up best of the rest. JAY VEE BEE far back in lacking any
early foot, saved ground, steered out a bit for the drive, improved position with some modest late interest. DAVIDIC LINE in the second group just off the
inside, dropped inside when moved a bit closer turning for home, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. HEROS REWARD dueled up front outside the
winner, continued to alternate for the advantage the middle half then gave way. HARD TO PARK lacked speed while racing off the inside, had nothing left
for the drive. GOLDEN SCEPTOR off a step slow, raced back and three wide, faded through the stretch.

Footnotes
CHERISHED broke on top, cleared to the inside, set the pace, continued to hold a daylight advantage past the furlong marker, held the runner up at bay late
while inside that one. JEWEL THIEF moved out while closest to the winner, chased that one through the turn, lost some ground to that same rival out of the
turn, roused for the drive, lost whip a sixteenth out, slowly gaining late. FIRST ALTERNATE in the second flight while racing just off the inside, lacked a
winning response when called on for the drive. READY ORB NOT last away, void of speed while saving ground, improved position while not a serious
threat. LOVELY LILIA broke to the outside, turned in an even effort while racing three wide. JOY IN THE JOURNEY within striking distance while three wide,
came up empty for the drive. JACCAT one paced, tired in the drive. SUMMER STORM four wide when lacking speed through the turn, remained back.
WHIMSICAL MUSE tired while racing three wide.

Footnotes
TWO THIRTY FIVE track the pace while saving ground, patiently handled the middle half, steered out three wide when advancing late in the final turn,
engaged the leader nearing the furlong grounds and wore that foe down while fully extended. SHANG took command past the wire the first time, set the
pace inside, responded when the winner came alongside in mid stretch, proved stubborn to the end. LONE SAILOR tucked to the inside when outrun in the
first turn, moved out to be three wide in the second bend, rallied for the show, no threat to the top two. GUEST SUITE lacked speed while saving ground
through the first turn, steadied onto the backstretch when in tight along the rail, continued to save ground, in some traffic late in the second turn, moved out
for the drive improved position. MY SIXTH SENSE void of early foot, continued back, steered out to be five wide into the stretch, staged a mild rally to pick
up a few positions late. KERSHAW prompted the leader from the outside for six furlongs and had little left for the drive. MUSICAL AMERICA went one
paced throughout while racing toward the inside. LONE ROCK also turned in an even effort while racing in the two path. DR. DORR void of speed in trailing
for almost six furlongs, passed tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SHARP PROSPECT in the main group well off the inside, four wide through the
final turn, failed to rally. TONE BROKE within striking distance for five furlongs, gave way. THIRSTFORLIFE was finished early while racing wide.

Footnotes
MERNEITH broke with the field, moved up to race forwardly and three wide took over into the lane, drew off as she pleased to win ridden out. IT'S MINE
void of speed, raced inside through the turn, improved position through the lane without posing a serious threat. GOOD SHABBOS within striking distance
off the inside, gave way in the drive. OCEAN BREEZE off a step slow, was used to move up to a forward position the opening quarter, tapped on the brakes
into the turn in some traffic, two path through the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, weakened a bit in the late going to lose the place.
SAINTSATION off the pace and the inside, three wide into and through the turn, improved position a bit while not a serious threat. EDEN lacked speed, in
the two path between rivals through the turn, made little impact in the drive. VISUAL MAGIC in mid pack, raced three wide through the turn, four wide into
the lane, steadied in some traffic, lacked a response in the drive. DANCEWITHTHEDEVIL showed some early speed along the inside, steadily retreated.
TIZ A GODDESS well off the inside, four wide through the turn, steadied while five wide into the lane, tired in the drive. SKYKAT off slow, raced well back,
never a factor. MS. DRAGONETTE set or forced the pace off the inside, stopped in the drive. GYPSY'S FEATHER off slow, was never close.
