Footnotes
DEHYDRATION with the pace from the start, dueled in the two path into and through the turn, shook off the other speed inside the furlong marker and drove
clear. COLLUDE in the second flight while in the two path, called on for some run into the stretch, in time for the place, not a serious threat to the winner
late. ALENA MARIE broke alertly, dueled inside the winner, could not match that one the final furlong, caught for the place a sixteenth out, managed to save
the show. ROZAFA broke in and slowly, raced well back while saving ground, rallied while continuing toward the inside, improved. MESANGE raced in mid
pack off the inside, moved out to be three wide midway on the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. EVERY SINGLE DAY
settled off the pace and the inside, four wide late in the turn, also went one paced through the lane in coming up empty. BUTYOUCALLEDME broke back,
steadied into the turn, dropped to the rail midway on the bend, saved ground into the stretch, made little impact to the wire. RIGMAROLE in the second flight
while racing outside, weakened in the drive. LILFEATHEREDINDIAN tired while racing off the inside. TRULY CLASSIC off slowly, remained always back.
UNSWEET TEA lacked speed, angled in a bit into the turn causing BUTYOUCALLEDME to steady, faded, trailed home.

CALL ME DERBY moved up after the start to contest the pace into the turn, continued to vie inside through the bend, dueled past the furlong marker,
proved best late in a determined effort. LEO DEL REO forwardly placed outside, pressed three wide into the lane, dueled past the furlong marker, outkicked
late. DESTINEDTOBEASTAR lacked early foot, raced three wide through the turn, set down for the drive, finished willingly while well out in the strip, too
late. COWBOY CACTUS JACK traffic into the turn, in the two path, went evenly through the lane in lacking a late punch. WASABI MOON off a bit slow,
raced back and just off the inside, improved position through the stretch without posing a serious threat. SMELLIN CANDY in mid pack of fthe inside, moved
closer four wide late in the turn and into the lane, flattened out late to lose some position. MOON DOG SPOT broke to the outside, turned in an even effort
while four wide through the turn. ORDAINED CAT washy, also broke out, sprinted clear early, vied through the turn while between foes, weakened in the
drive. BABADOOOK lacked early foot, four wide through the turn, remained back in the drive. C H JAY was finished early while racing three wide. DREXEL

Footnotes
WRATH cleared to the inside into the first turn, showed the way by daylight under restraint up the backstretch, increased advantage into the lane, roused,
enough left to hold off the runner up late. ESKENDEREYAS DREAM settled off the pace inside, angled out steadily through the second turn to be four wide
for the drive, set down, finished well to be getting to the winner late. CAMPAIGN SPY brushed at the start, chased the winner in the two path throughout,
had little for that one in the drive, proved no match for the runner up, comfortably saved the show. CHAPEL BARN within striking distance into the first turn,
pulled while continuing to save ground, went evenly in lacking a late kick. COWBOYS DREAM raced outside, moved closer before a half, three wide through
the final turn, also was one paced through the stretch in lacking a late punch. NEW YEAR'S LUCK raced in mid pack while off the inside, failed to respond
when called on for the drive. NEGRONI UP pinched at the start to be off slow, fell further back before a quarter, four wide turning for home, improved
position. HARD TO IMPRESS void of speed, passed a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. TRACKING GOLD shuffled back at the start, was never a
factor. STRONG ARM had nothing for the drive. FREE INDEED broke in, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
DEVILS HALO close from the start inside, dueled through the turn while remaining along the rail under light restraint, shook off the other speed entgering
the stretch, drew off under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. MEANBONE steadied just after the start, raced back early as a result, advanced while
saving ground into the stretch, proved no match for the winner, clear for the place. MOSTLY SUNNY settled off the pace inside, improved to be along for the
show, best of the rest. SOUTHSIDER void of early foot, in the two path through the turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. TRE LEE
DIVINE forwardly paced while off the inside, three wide through the turn, weakened in the drive. GREY MASK in mid pack early off the inside, checked up in
traffic into the turn, lacked a response in the drive. DINGDINGDINGDING narrowly showed the way early while between horses, dueled outside the winner
through the turn, gave way in the drive. IOWA NATIVE prompted the issue early three wide, began a steady retreat before a half. MONDAY CONFESSION
broke back, never menaced. ALL SHACKED UP was always outrun while five wide throughout. MEETME AT D'STREET tired after racing four wide. RIKER
was finished early, trailed home. PER RULING DATED 8/12/20 RECEIVED FROM THE ARKANSAS RACING COMMISSION (RULING #2020-OP-30),
DEVILS HALO WAS DQ'D FROM ALL PURSUE MONIES AND UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
HIDDEN PROMISE outrun early just off the inside, closer in some traffic late in the turn, steered out three wide late in the bend, angled back down into the
two path under clever handling, got through, engaged the leader inside the furlong grounds and wore that rival down under brisk pressure. TIME HEIST
broke alertly, showed the way inside, continued to vie into the lane along the rail, edged briefly clear with a furlong remaining, responded when the winner
came alongside soon after and gave ground grudgingly to that rival, clearly second best. DR. BEETS within striking distance off the inside, came four wide
out of the turn, proved no match for the top two late, gained the nod for the show. KINETIC SWAGGER raced off the pace well out in the strip, five wide
through the turn, finished up evenly late to miss the show. RAHAAL raced back, angled out to be four wide late in the turn, displayed some mild late interest
while well out in the strip. RUNTECH was never really dangerous inside. TAPIT ON RACE DAY off a step slow, lacked speed, improved position while four
wide out of the turn, no real threat. TO THE FRONT pressed the pace while between foes up the backstretch, continued to force the issue through the turn,
faltered in the drive. RIP IT RYAN void of any early foot, angled toward the inside turn, passed tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. BIG HEADED
BABY in the second flight early, steadily faded through the stretch. PACK'N IRON was finished early while racing three wide. NUMIDIAN prompted the early
pace while three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
KATZARELLI outrun for six furlongs along the inside, steered out to be four wide late in the final turn when beginning to advance, widest in the drive,
finished willingly to kick clear late. DAVIDIC LINE behind the leaders while saving all the ground, moved slightly closer late in the final turn while continuing
along the inside, got through along the rail into the stretch, unable to match the winner late, game for the place. RIVER FINN broke on top, clear in the first
turn in showing the way inside, continued to set the pace inside, came off the rail a bit into the lane allowing the runner up the rail, outkicked by that rival for
the place late. ITS MY BAG BABY closest to the leader off the inside, moved to challenge that one late in the final turn, vied past the furlong marker, not
enough late for the place. ARTEMUS EAGLE within striking distance while racing three wide came up empty for the drive. ICECAP off the pace and the
inside into the first turn, continued back, dropped inside second turn, did not fire. NASHVEGAS remained always back. BEL BIMBO bobbled at the start,
was finished after a half.

Footnotes
C'EST MARDI close up early inside and under firm restraint, chased the leader up the backstretch, took over in the two path midway on the second
turn,drew steadily clear while being kept to task. QUIET DAWN in the second flight off the inside, came three wide into the lane, could do little with the
winner in the drive, clearly second best. FIONA POWER four wide into the first turn when off the pace, raced three wide through the second bend, staged a
mild rally to annex the show. MEBS WEB pulled early toward the inside, continued to save some ground the middle half, two path into the lane, steered out
with a furlong to run and finished up evenly in lacking a closing punch. CHALDEA broke on top, cleared toward the inside onto the backstretch, set the pace
the middle half, faltered when headed by the winner midway o the final turn. GYPSY WIND off a step slow, void of speed, swung five wide into the lane,
improved position with some modest late interest. LIL' SHOPPER forwardly placed early, saved ground in the second turn, finished up one paced.
PRINCESS LUCKY settled off the pace and the inside, four wide in the second turn, lacked a closing kick. DEDE'S TRICK never menaced. ILLUSIONISTA
raced three out to four wide, was also never a threat. BAILDON five wide into the first turn, raced back, never involved. HOUSE DRUNK broke back, pulled
up in the first turn and was vanned off.

Footnotes
TOWN CHAMP away in good order showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn, clear into the stretch along the inside, enough left late to hold the
runner up safe. TUGGLE within striking distance along the inside, followed the winner into the stretch, tipped out, set down, finished willingly to close the
gap on the winner, too late at the end. UNION RIDE lacked early foot, moved closer along the inside late turn, in traffic into the lane, no match for the top
two, clear of the others. AMERICAN MANDATE in mid pack while racing off the inside, lacked the needed response in the drive. MORNING SNOW
pressured the winner off the inside for a half, weakened in the drive. LOCALLY OWNED void of early foot toward the inside, angled out to be four wide into
the lane, came up empty for the stretch run. EL ASESINO forwardly placed for a half while in the three path, gave way when the real running began at the
head of the lane. TALE OF FAME was finished before a half. REPLETE off slow, choppy, pulled up soon after, vanned off.

Footnotes
READYFORMYCLOSEUP broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside, shook off the other speed when straightened for home, remained clear to the wire
under steady handling. ADHWAA in the second flight while along the inside, switched out for the drive, roused, finished well late to be carving quickly into
the winner's advantage. GURL YOU FINE raced back off the early pace in the two path, moved inside midway on the turn, two path again entering the
stretch, finished willingly to be clear of the others. MONEY WELL SPENT away in good order, dueled inside the winner for four furlongs, gradually
weakened through the lane while continuing along the inside. SHALLOW lacked speed while just off the inside for a half, improved position inside of rivals
without posing a serious threat. AUSTIN'S GAL came out in the early going to bother LUMINAIRE, raced in the second flight, had little left for the drive while
three wide. EASY TIGER in the main body outside, came five wide out of the turn, finished up evenly. CAVATICA steadied in some traffic into the turn when
well off the pace, failed to muster a rally while three wide. WHOVILLE settled off the pace just off the inside, tired in the drive. LUMINAIRE steadied just after
the start, raced back, five wide turning for home, failed to muster a rally. WILD ESCAPE forwardly placed while four wide up the backstretch, stopped early
in the turn.
