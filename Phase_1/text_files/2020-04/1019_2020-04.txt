Footnotes
MY LEGACY forward from the start, pressed the leader into the turn, pursued that same foe into the stretch while n the two path, took over, drove clear.
RIVERS OF LITE stalked the pace while in the three path, could not keep pace with the winner in the drive, edged clear for the place. WYOMING
CONQUEST away in good order, showed the way into the turn along the inside, gained a slightly larger advantage late in the bend, offered brief resistance
when confronted by the winner nearing the furlong grounds, weakened, managed to narrowly save the show. WRITTEN PERMISSION in the second flight
while between horses, rank into the turn, continued unsettled until asked along late in the bend, went evenly through the stretch to miss the show. FAST
RECOVERY hesitated at the start, well back early as a result, saved ground through the turn, improved position up the inside. TOUGH COMPANY settled in
mid pack toward the inside, went evenly in the drive. BEGIN THE BEGIN lacked early foot, moved to the inside turn, in some traffic midstretch, improved
position slightly when clear late. DATA CAT tired while racing along the inside. PAROLEE four out to five wide through the turn, came up empty for the
drive. MAYAN GHOST tired while racing three wide. WENYEN off a step slow, was always outrun. GRASSETTO four wide through the turn, backed up
through the stretch.

Footnotes
TIMES SQUARE outrun in the early going, moved outside midway on the first turn, four wide through the second turn when advancing, bid, clear, held
runner up safe late under steady handling. MAJORS VINDICATION settled off the pace and the inside, in traffic midway on the second turn, finished up
willingly when clear for the drive to annex the place. DELP in mid pack toward the inside, steered out to be three then four wide turning for home, lacked a
closing punch to finish up best of the rest. MICA BAY within striking distance in hand and inside, behind a wall of horses exiting the final turn, came up
empty for the stretch run when clear. EXECUTIVE BRANCH away in good order, set the pace along the inside, faltered when headed by the winner entering
the stretch. GEORGIA DEPUTY last away, trailed early, improved position by passing mostly tiring rivals inside. METROPOL four wide through the first turn
when off the pace, failed to muster a rally. MOST AMUSING closest to the leader, advanced on that one to challenge midway on the final turn, gave way in
the drive. MUTINEER remained always back while racing toward the inside. KNOWYOUROPTIONS forwardly placed while racing outside, gave way.
PAINTED CANYON void of early foot, far back, trailed home.

Footnotes
TOO PRETTY close up from the start off the inside, dueled in the run up the backstretch, challenged outside the leader into the far turn, brief duel, clear into
the stretch, drew out late. LOVELY LOU broke alertly, settled off the pace and the inside, dropped in late in the final turn, finished willingly to be clearly
second best, no threat to the winner. MOONSHINE MISS forwardly placed while moving off the inside, asked along in the second turn, proved no match for
the top two in the drive, well clear of the others. DAIGLE off a step slow, void of early foot while toward the inside, improved position without posing a
serious threat. HIGHTAIL RUNAWAY far back early in trailing for a half, steered out five wide into the lane, improved position while also not a serious threat.
CYBER SENSATION 5w into the first turn, four wide through the final turn, passed tiring rivals. LIL' FANCY with the early pace, alternated for the advantage
closest to the inside the middle half, gave way in the drive. LADY MONDORO failed to menace while racing three wide. DIXIE CAT began to tire after a half
while racing toward the inside. BANKER NITA four wide into the first turn, raced back, finished after five furlongs. FURZY broke back, moved up to race in
mid pack along the inside, faltered far turn. MORNING VALENTINE staged a steady retreat while racing outside.

Footnotes
LADY GUSTO off a step slow, raced back, angled in a bit midturn, roused for the drive, late surge, going away. FLATOUTCOUNTRY with the pace off the
inside, vied between rivals turn, dueled past the furlong marker,shook off the other speed to be clear late, proved no match for the winner. DANCIN IN
PARADISE away well, with the pace along the inside, weakened a bit late, managed to hold the show. COMPETITIVE FIRE void of speed, saved some
ground turn, steered out, improved while finding her best stride too late. PUNISH lacked any early foot, raced four wide through the turn, improved a bit, not
enough late for the show. SIX FIRE in the second flight just off the inside, came up empty for the drive. TWIRLING AROUND broke out, pressed the leaders
three wide into and through the turn, faltered down the lane. OH MY OH in mid pack while racing well out in the strip,continued five wide through the turn,
lacked a closing kick. ELITE SONG moved off the inside the opening quarter, raced three wide through the turn and tired. SUMMER LOVIN mid pack, tired
while saving ground out of the turn. CHEROKEE CHATTER raced with the second flight outside, four wide turn, faded through the lane. HALEYS HEIST
broke out, raced back, five wide into the lane, tired while drifting out.

Footnotes
SKYVALUE narrowly set the pace along the inside, shook off the other speed to be well clear past the furlong marker, kept to task. COLLUDE within striking
distance off the inside, three wide turn when moving a bit closer, could do little with the winner the final furlong, clearly second best. VOILA BABY dueled up
front while off the inside, could not match the winner in the drive nor contain the runner up, clear of the others. IT'S ALL CASH off a step slow, raced back,
five wide through the turn, improved position in the drive with some belated interest. GOLD INCLUDED lacked speed, four wide into the stretch while
between rivals, improved position. JAVISTHA settled off the pace while along the inside, lost some position late in the turn, remained inside, improved
position drive while not a serious threat. HOT LIL MESS in the second flight along the inside, came up empty for the drive. LIAM'S TEMPEST broke out,
forwardly placed for four furlongs after moving toward the inside, tired in the drive. DARING DAMSEL lacked speed, four wide into the turn, five wide exiting,
failed to rally. LUSCIOUS fell back to trail, always outrun in showing little. MINJI in mid pack early outside, three wide turn, remained back. DARK
SARCASM was finished early.

Footnotes
WHITMORE settled off the pace while outside in the second flight, crept closer four wide late in the turn, lost some ground to the leader turning for home,
collared that rival inside the furlong marker, gained advantage, clear late, enough left in the waning strides to last. FLAGSTAFF off a step slow, trailed well
back, steered out sharply to be widest for the drive, closed full of run down the middle of the strip to be rapidly getting to the winner. MANNY WAH behind
the pace, raced in the two path turn, moved a bit closer inside of traffic late in the bend, moved to the rail for the drive and finished up willingly to earn the
show. NITROUS lacked speed after moving toward the inside, continued in the two path through the turn, shifted out a bit for some room approaching
midstretch, displayed some late interest to improve his position. WENDELL FONG in the second flight between foes in the two path, rated into the turn,
moved out a bit around a tiring rival midway on the bend, set down for the drive, brushed with a tiring HIDDEN SCROLL late and finished up evenly. SHARE
THE UPSIDE broke alertly, set or forced the pace in the two path, vied past the furlong marker then weakened the final sixteenth. HIDDEN SCROLL moved
up after breaking with the field to prompt the issue three wide, vied on the outside into the lane, held a narrow advantage when straightened for home, was
appearing to tire late when in tight, steadied and continued to give way. HOG CREEK HUSTLE lacked any early foot, improved late in the turn in the three
path then flattened out in the drive. MR. JAGERMEISTER behind the leaders while under stout restraint and a bit rank in the run into the turn, faltered in the
drive when called on. LEXITONIAN lacked speed toward the inside, failed to muster a response in the drive. BOBBY'S WICKED ONE broke well, contested
the issue for three furlongs, stopped, jogged in.

Footnotes
BREAK EVEN broke well, clear to the inside, was given a breather while showing the way through the turn, shook clear upper stretch, ridden out. MT.
BRAVE moved up to race closest to the winner in the run up the backstretch, inched closer to that rival late in the turn, proved no match in the drive, all out
to hold the place. HEADLAND within striking distance, raced three wide through the turn, also could do little with the winner in the drive, outfinished for the
second spot. SHANGHAI TARIFF went one paced along the inside, lacked a closing kick. HEAVENS WHISPER void of early foot, steadied in some traffic
into the turn, fell back, improved position in the drive, not a serious threat. SPRING IN THE WIND off a step slow, raced back and outside, floated out five
wide into the stretch, lacked a closing kick. HONEY'S SOX APPEAL back early off the pace, improved position a bit while saving ground through the turn,
failed to sustain that advance in the drive. MEADOW DANCE remained always back in lacking a closing response. LIZ'S CABLE GIRL broke sharp, briefly
raced forwardly and inside, faded. RAINTREE STARLET bobbled, bothered to be off slowly, four wide into the turn, faded.

Footnotes
CE CE broke well, settled off the pace well out in the strip, continued to race outside under light restraint in the run up the backstretch, in the four path
entering the stretch, set down when straightened for home, closed with good resolve to be up in the final strides. OLLIE'S CANDY broke sharp, narrowly
showed the way through the first turn, shook clear onto the backstretch, rated the middle half mile, called on for some run late in the final bend, continued to
hold a sizable advantage past the furlong marker, just failed to contain the winner in a solid effort, clearly second best. POINT OF HONOR last away, devoid
of speed in trailing for over five furlongs, moved out to be six wide out of the final turn, closest willingly down the middle of the track to garner the show.
STREET BAND unhurried in the early going, continued back early backstretch, began to advance into the far turn, dropped to the fence soon after improved
steadily into the lane, flattened out late to be caught for the show. SARACOSA well back off the pace, asked to run late in the final turn, angled five wide into
the lane, displayed a moderate amount of late interest to improve while remaining well out in the strip. HOROLOGIST settled off the pace while toward the
inside, began to move closer midway on the final turn, blocked behind horses into the lane, continued to lack room until a furlong remained, shift out a bit
and finished with late energy. GO GOOGLE YOURSELF raced in mid pack while off the inside, moved a bit closer while four wide and in traffic turning for
home, flattened out in the final furlong to lose a couple of positions. LADY APPLE void of speed, in some traffic out of the final turn, improved a bit in the
drive while not a major player. AWE EMMA went one paced throughout in lacking a late punch. QUEEN NEKIA broke back and was never a threat.
SERENGETI EMPRESS broke with the leaders, pressed the issue through the first turn in the three path, continued to pursue the pace the middle half then
gave way in the drive. COME DANCING forwardly placed for six furlongs just off the inside, also had little left for the drive. COLDWATER in mid pack for five
furlongs just off the inside, gave way in the second turn. COOKIE DOUGH vied up front early between horses, chased the runner up up the backstretch,
stopped in the far turn, finished far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
CURLIN RULES broke alertly, set the pace inside, headed midway on the final turn, came back better that rival by midstretch when headed by a second
rival, battled back in game fashion to prove best. ARRIVAL four wide into the first turn when forwardly placed, stalked in the run up the backstretch, ranged
up to put a head in front into the stretch, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, outkicked in the late going, clear for the place. DEGROM void of
early foot, continued back into the far turn, steered out to be four wide turning for home, finished willingly down the middle of the strip to be getting to the top
two late. KURILOV (CHI) lacked speed, four wide rally out of the final turn, managed some gain on the top pair the final furlong while not having enough for
the show.l. SUPER DUDE went evenly while racing three wide. EISENSTAEDT checked up in tight quarters into the first turn, rated the middle half, in traffic
again late in the second turn, improved somewhat in the drive in finishing up evenly. MATROOH prompted the pace off the inside, moved to engage the
winner in the second turn, put a head in front midway on that bend then gradually weakened through the stretch. ZERO GRAVITY void of early foot, passed
tiring rivals while out in the strip. COLONELSDARKTEMPER five wide into the first turn, continued well wide up the backstretch, five wide again into the far
bend and began to tire. HAWAAKOM off a step slow, remained back in failing to threaten. SPIKES SHIRL settled in mid pack three wide early, gave way.
TIMELINE within striking distance while saving ground, stopped in the drive.
