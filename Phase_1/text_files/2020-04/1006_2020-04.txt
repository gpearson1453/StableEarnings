Footnotes
P R GOLD PLAY tracked the early leader three wide to bid through the far turn and move clear into the lane then held the margin under steady handling. P
R STREAKIN saved ground to late in the far turn, angled out to move three wide into the lane but could not close on the winner. PETE AND REPETE
settled off the pace three wide, moved inside on the far turn then steadied and altered outward nearing the lane to avoid a stopping rival and rallied clear for
the show. P R WHY NOT moved up three and four wide while not a threat. TIZ A MAGIC MAN followed the pace three or four wide and weakened. IN SIDE
THE LINE showed the most early speed to make the pace about the three path then gave way in the far turn. RAGTOP RED was along the inside, bolted to
the outside fence entering the far turn and was pulled up by the outrider in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
WITTS LUCKY SHOES contested the early lead inside BRAVE ONE to move clear through the turn then held safe in the lane under steady urging. BRAVE
ONE contested the pace outside the winner and could not match strides nearing the lane. GO WEST INDY tracked the top pair three wide and lacked a final
closing run. JOJOGOTTAGO went evenly while three or four wide. BIG TIME PLAYER saved ground and lacked a closing bid. I C WELL tried to duck into
the gap racing onto the main track and dropped back early, angled four wide nearing the lane and moved up while no threat. HEZA FORTUNE broke to the
outside to bump with a rival, chased four and five wide in the turn and weakened. R DEJA VOO was not a factor. BLACK ELK bumped with a rival at the
start then was hung five and six wide through the turn. STREET CRY DANCER trailed with no apparent mishap.

and gained the place but could not get to the winner. DOROTHE MARIE rallied four to six wide through the far turn into the lane and could not sustain the
move late. DISTINCT APPROVAL was on the pace four wide outside rivals to move clear heading up the backstretch but weakened into the lane. CASH TIZ
WONDERFUL saved ground and lacked a final closing rally. INTOXICATING KISS dropped well back off the early pace and moved up four and five wide
while not a threat late. CALIFORNIASUMMER was four wide and lacked a solid bid. KINLEY CASH contested the early lead inside rivals while out from the

Footnotes
RETROFIT forced the pace outside SPA SHACKALACKA through the turn, wore that one down in the lane and was slowly edging clear late. SPA
SHACKALACKA contested the pace about the three path inside the winner and could not handle that one late. BETA CAPO SONG tracked the top pair
three wide and could not produce the needed late run. WITT'S GOLD saved ground and lacked a final closing bid. DAVE failed to mount a rally four and five
wide. JOHN ARNOLD was four wide, fanned six wide into the lane and could not threaten. JUST DUE failed to mount a bid three wide. RESILIENCE OF
LOVE was not a threat two or three wide. LAW BREAKER trailed racing outside.

and five wide in the far turn to get nearest the winner but could not close late. EMERALD POINT made a mild four wide rally. HOLY MARIE moved up three
wide to split foes late in the far turn going through a narrow opening then could not threaten late. OUR ANABELLE was not a serious threat three and four
wide. LEGENDARY SONG saved ground and was not a factor. LATESUMMERAFFAIR was with the early pace three or four wide and weakened. FOXY
TWIST was always back. SPELL WINDER tracked the early pace four or five wide and weakened. LA INDIA prompted the early pace three wide and tired.

Footnotes
CHICKES DONE settled off the pace three or four wide, moved closer nearing the lane then rallied late to collar the leaders deep stretch and be moving
clear. WHO'S THE DIVA NOW bumped with a rival at the start, was on the pace about the two or three path, shook off a bid into the far turn then could not
contain the winner's late run. SHELL LOCKET bumped with a rival at the start, dropped off the pace three or four wide, moved up through the far turn to
angle in turning for home and closed late. KURIOUS KENNEDY made a mild four wide rally but could not threaten late. SHES THE BEAST tracked the early
leaders three wide and lacked a closing rally. FASHION FACT prompted the pace outside WHO'S THE DIVA NOW to bid into the far turn but weakened
nearing the lane. HOLY CABALLERO saved ground and was not a factor. GOVENESS SHEILA tired racing four wide. CLINE TIME lunged and threw her
head at the break to get away very awkwardly, saved ground and tired.

MAN CAMP dueled on the lead outside DUN SOBER throughout and continued gamely in the lane to win the head bob. DUN SOBER dueled inside the
winner throughout and just missed in a game effort. GOLD ECLIPSE stalked the dueling leaders three or four wide and went evenly through the lane to hold
position. MASTERFUL STRIDE saved ground and moved up but could not threaten in the lane. I'M RIVER lacked a rally racing two or three wide.
CLIPBOARD MONEY followed the pace four wide and weakened. BANKER BOB was not a factor.

Footnotes
BLUE HARBOR settled off the early leaders four wide, moved to challenge leaving the second turn to bid going up the backstretch, put away YO Y ME
through the far turn then held the margin to the wire. MR. TICKLE was unhurried early racing outside, launched his rally five and six wide through the far
turn and closed well late to narrowly gain the place but was too late. YO Y ME was on the pace three and four wide outside AWESOME EMMIT, continued
with the winner into the far turn then continued willingly but could not hold the place late. THETRASHMANSCOMING dropped off the early pace, angled out
through the second turn, continued outside in the far turn to rally six wide into the lane but could not threaten. DOBY stalked the pace four wide and lacked a
closing run. TED W saved ground in reach of the pace to the far turn and weakened. MAS MISCHIEF failed to mount a bid racing three wide. AWESOME
EMMIT disputed the pace inside YO Y ME while out from the rail and tired nearing the lane. BIGSHOT LACEWELL tucked inside to save ground early and
failed to threaten. ROCK CITY ROADHOG tracked the early pace four wide and tired.
