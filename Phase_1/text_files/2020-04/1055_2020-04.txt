showed good speed from the inside, built a clear lead into the lane but was no match for the winner late. PRAY FOR JAKE was allowed to settled in the
early going, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. SITUATENSHADY was slow early, raced towards the inside and had not
enough in the drive. LETSPLAYAGAME vied for the early lead while racing just off the inside and gave way. RAINBOWS TREASURE stalked the pace from
the outside, raced four wide at the eighth pole and weakened. AUTHORATIF was unhurried early and failed to have a response. TIMES FLYING BY raced

Footnotes
R LUKKI SONG showed good early speed and was well clear late under a strong hand ride. STAR PRADO was allowed to settle early, moved up along the
inside through the far turn into the lane but was no match for the winner. HALLIES DREAM stalked the early leader, raced three wide in the stretch and
weakened late. JULIARD HONOR was unhurried early, raced three deep and lacked a late response. YAK ATTACK raced six wide into the upper stretch
and never was a factor. DAKAMO ROSE stalked the pace, raced four wide in the upper stretch and weakened late. NORA'S LEGACY was off a step slow,
raced towards the inside and never was a factor. ZIPPORAH dropped back early and failed to have a response. CHEROKEE DARLING saved ground and
never was a factor. FLAT QUICK was slow early and never threatened. MIGHTY VISION stalked the pace, took up sharply past the half mile pole and tired.
MISS TYRO was hustled early and faded.

DAME PLATA pressed the early pace, moved up four wide through the stretch and finished well to be clear under strong handling. MILTONTOWN stalked
the pace, raced in tight quarters nearing the quarter pole and got up for the place position late while racing along the inside. GATO GUAPO was unhurried
early, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and gained ground willingly late. DRIFTING WEST stalked the pace, raced five wide at the eighth pole and
kept on to the wire. VANGILDER settled off the early pace, angled three wide through the lane and had no final winning bid. GRADE ONE showed good
early speed and gave way. GENTRIFIED was slow early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. GOLD BUYER failed to sustain a bid.

WELDER tracked the leader down the backstretch while racing two wide, moved up four wide through the lane to take command under a hand ride and was
in hand late. SHANNON C showed good early speed, floated out just a bit into the lane and was clearly second best. EUROWEST settled off the early pace,
moved up six wide at the eighth pole and had no final winning bid. FLY TO THE BANK stalked the pace, raced four wide through the lane and had no
response. TIMELY REPLY dropped back early, saved ground and never was a factor. ROCKPORT KAT raced five wide into the upper stretch and never
was a factor. GOSPEL CHEROKEY stalked the pace and tired. CRIMINAL saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT PHAT stalked the early pace, raced three deep and held in the drive under strong encouragement. WHIMSICAL TALE settled off the early pace,
moved up along the inside through the stretch and got up late for the place position. JIM'S ANGEL was unhurried early, raced five wide into the lane and
finished willingly to the wire. WAY TOO CUTE was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide through the drive and had not enough late. BAYTOWN MILLI
vied for the early lead and gave way. LADY THUNDER dropped back early, raced four wide in the lane and never was a factor. HOPE AND A DREAM
raced six wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. DREAMING SILENT stalked the pace from the outside and weakened. KEENE'S DESIRE
pressed the pace and faded. SUNNY'S FUNNY was off slowly, took up sharply as riderless horse interfered at the five eighths pole and remained back after
a troubling trip. NOTABLE INTEREST raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. MADISON'S PLACE stumbled at the break and
unseated his jockey.
