Footnotes
DESTINY'S LOVE pressed the issue early while widest of the first flight up the backstretch, angled in slightly to be three wide early in the turn, put a head in
front midway on the bend, shook clear in upper stretch, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. C P QUALITY in the second flight while in the
three path, continued to follow the winner out of the turn, set down for the drive, late surge to be cutting into the margin late while holding sway for the pace
spot. LOUISE THE LASER in some traffic behind the leaders into the turn, remained behind horses through the bend, tilted out to be three wide with a
quarter remaining, outfinished for the place. DESERT THIEF broke alertly, narrowly set the early pace inside, dueled with the winner late in the turn then
could not keep up. GEMINI JOURNEY settled off the pace inside, worked way out to three wide late in the turn, improved position a bit in the drive with
some mild late interest. WESTLODGE INTRIGUE in the second group while racing outside, four wide through the turn, failed to muster a closing response.
D'WILDCAT INDIAN lacked speed off the inside, three wide through the turn, also improved slightly through the lane while not a serious threat. ANITA
MARIE with the pace three wide and between rivals into the turn, gave way in the drive. HEART'S PASSION off a step slow, remained always back. A J'S
GRAND well back for a half, failed to rally. SEASIDE SURPRISE was finished after a half. AS FAST AS YOU CAN flashed brief early speed along the inside
and stopped.

Footnotes
MISS IMPERIAL prompted the pace while three wide, challenged exiting the turn, drifted slightly when dueling past the furlong marker, drew clear late under
pressure. HAWT MESS broke out, pressed early, vied into the turn, got briefly clear midway on the bend, responded when the winner came alongside soon
after, dueled upper stretch, could not match strides late. MADISON WAY within striking distance early, in the two path through the turn, finished up best of
the rest while too the inside of the top pair the final furlong. BOATHOUSE VIEW back off the pace, angled out to be three wide turning for home, went
evenly the final furlong in lacking a closing response. ENJAY'S BRASS raced behind the early leaders under stout restraint, steadied with five furlongs
remaining, continued to save ground into and through the turn, came up empty for the stretch run. HOPTOWN HONEY in the second flight while three wide
and between horses, had little left for the stretch run. COUNCIL RULES failed to menace outside. JOSIE THE E F FIVE off a step slow, raced four wide
through the turn as was also never a threat. GIRO KATE off slow then steadied, void of speed inside, remained back through the lane. ADHERETOME
broke on top, vied up front for three furlongs along the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
SKOL FACTOR broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled through the turn, put that foe away when straightened for home, drew off, ridden
out. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS lacked early foot well wide, carried out a bit into the bend, five path through the rest of the turn, advanced, proved no match for
the winner, up late for the place. OAK ROOM off slow while being bothered, raced well back early, angled out to be three wide when beginning to advance
late in the turn, continued willingly to the wire while too late for the place. SAILOR CHOW forwardly placed behind the winner early, in some traffic between
horses into the turn, went evenly into and through the stretch, lost the show late. GAMBLER ROCKET forwardly placed and outside, moved up to duel
outside the winner through the turn, faltered in the drive. IDEOLOGY void of early foot, raced four down to three wide through the turn, improved position
through the lane without posing a serious threat. VIOLENT PASS bobbled at the start to be off slowly, raced back, carried out to be five wide early in the
turn, went evenly down the stretch. ILLUMINATI in mid pack while off the inside, four wide through the turn, lacked a rally. BELFAST BOY came out just
after the start, back off the pace inside, continued to save ground to no avail through the turn, in some traffic entering the stretch, failed to menace when
clear. QUALITY WARRIOR lacked speed after breaking back, got out to carry a couple of rivals out early in the turn, tired in the drive. NOW TIZ TIME
floated out at the start, forced the issue early along the inside, began a steady retreat before a half. YOU'RE IN COREY in the second flight early inside, in
tight then steadied entering the turn, fell back and did not recover.

Footnotes
SHOOTERS SHOOT broke with the leaders, dueled into the turn closest to the inside, continued to alternate up the backstretch and through the far turn,
regained a narrow advantage a furlong out, dug in to the wire to narrowly prevail in game fashion. BLACKBERRY WINE broke well, set or forced the pace in
the two path, set down for the drive, headed in midstretch and was then outgamed in the final strides, well clear of the others. MO MOSA fractious while
loading, restless once in the gate, broke with the field, lacked speed just off the inside, moved out a bit for the drive, rallied to be clear for the show, no threat
to the top pair. AMEN CORNER off a step slow, raced back, three wide through the final bend, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve
position. CLEON JONES closest to the dueling leaders just off the rail, continued to chase that pair around the final turn, weakened in the drive.
WARRIOR'S MAP void of speed in trailing for six furlongs, four wide into the lane, improved position by passing mostly tiring rivals late while remaining
outside. SCABBARD made little impact while racing mostly toward the inside, angled out turning for home, came up empty. FORT MCHENRY four wide into
the first turn, continued outside, failed to muster a rally. WOOPIGSOOIE settled in mid pack off the inside, three wide through the final turn, had nothing left
for the run to the wire. NO SHIRT NO SHOES in the second flight while racing off the inside, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
CASUAL behind the first flight in the run up the backstretch, continued to stalk in the two path turn, waited behind a wall of horses into the lane, moved out
slightly and split foes approaching the furlong ground, late duel closest to the inside, proved best in a determined effort. SILVERBELLA within striking
distance well out in the strip, four wide through the turn when creeping closer, challenged on the outside when straightened for home, dueled the final
furlong outside the winner, outkicked. CYNICAL GIRL off the pace while well wide, five wide through the turn, mild rally down the middle of the strip to gain
the show, no match for the top two. MILLENNIUM FORCE narrowly set the pace along the inside, weakened when headed entering the stretch, lost the
show late. NASTY lacked speed out in the strip, asked along three wide midway on the turn, traffic, dropped toward the inside entering the stretch, improved
with some mild interest. CONGRATULATED vied up front early, dueled through the turn in the two path, faltered in the drive. ANGEL DE CORA off a step
slow, raced back and three wide, improved slightly through the stretch while not a serious threat. LEGGS GALORE forwardly placed for a half three wide,
retreated. FRENCH CAFE forwardly placed early just off the inside, gave way in the turn. CAGED BEAR remained always back. SIGNIFY off a step slow,
moved up along the inside, shuffled back along the rail into the turn, continued to fade.

Footnotes
PNEUMATIC a it rank when four wide through the first turn, continued keen up the backstretch outside, asked, advanced four wide midway on the final turn,
took over, drove clear. CAPTAIN BOMBASTIC broke on top, set the pace inside under light restraint, dueled through the final turn, proved no match for the
winner the final furlong, edged clear for the place spot. MY FRIENDS BEER lacked speed while settling in the two path, asked 3/8, three wide out of the final
turn, moved out further with a furlong remaining, up late for the show. DACK JANIEL'S within striking distance along the inside, continued to save ground
through the final turn, came up empty when called on for the drive, nipped late for the show. FORTHELUVOFBOURBON stumbled just after the start,
recovered to race within striking distance, shifted out in deep stretch, not enough for the show. CYRIL'S BOY bobbled just after the start, closest to the
runner up off the inside, joined that one in the far turn, dueled into the stretch, held a narrow and brief advantage with a furlong to run then gave way.
GIOCARE bothered just after the start, raced back and failed to menace. STRONG TIDE was not a threat while racing three wide. SIXTO bothered just after
the start, trailed, showed little.

unhurried early while three wide in the first turn, angled in a bit while pulling up the backstretch, dropped to the rail far turn, got through turning for home,
finished up best of the rest. BEAVER HAT four out to five wide in the first turn when off the pace, four wide through the second turn, went evenly in the drive.
PLANE TALK dueled up frong along the inside, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner into the lane then gave awy. TONALTALITARIAN off a step
slow, raced back, made a mild middle move four wide through the second turn, encountered some traffic with a quarter remaining, steadied briefly then
lacked a further advance. SHAKA broke back, lagged far back, swung out widest turning for home and improved position down the middle of the strip.
STOCK DEAL lacked speed off the inside, floated out to be five wide late in the final turn, lacked a closing kick. PINE KNOLL dueled up front off the inside,
got out with five furlongs remaining allowing for a couple of foes to challenge inside of him, vied 2nd turn then gave way. FEATHERED INDIAN prompted
the two leaders in the three path, moved to challenge in the far turn, faltered in the drive. BAKER'S MAN remained back. SMACK ATTACK steadily faded
along the inside.

Footnotes
TOM'S D'ETAT raced off the pace along the inside into the first turn, lost some position midway on that bend, asked a bit and steered out to circle five wide
toward the front turning for home, kicked down the leader in a solid effort. IMPROBABLE restless in the gate, with the first flight while four wide through the
first turn, continued to force the issue outside, one again was four wide through the second bend, shook off the other speed to be clear when straightened
for home, could not contain the winner, clearly second best. BANKIT lacked speed toward the inside, steered out sharply to be four wide turning into the
stretch, finished willingly to be well clear of the others. PIONEER SPIRIT broke alertly, narrowly set the pace along the inside, lost contact with the runner up
turning for home, continued to gradually weaken to lose another couple of positions. SLICK SILVER void of speed, steered out late in the first turn, moved
back to the inside for the second bend, roused, improved inside of traffic into the lane, finished up evenly. MR. MONEY settled off the pace toward the inside
early, moved out and raced three wide through the second turn, called on for run with three furlongs remaining but largely lacked a closing resposne. LONG
RANGE TODDY restless in the gate, unhurried while moving toward the inside early, three down to two wide through the second bend while patiently
handled, also was found lacking to finish up evenly. SNAPPER SINCLAIR with the pace three wide and inside the runner up, lightly restrained, gave way
when the real running began turning for home. FIGHT ON void of speed while racing outside, five wide through the final turn, failed to muster a rally. LORD
GUINNESS off a step slow, moved up while five wide in the first turn, was finished after a half. BOLDOR pressed the pace in the two path and between
rivals for six furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
PRODIGIOUS BAY away in good order, clear past the wire the first time, rated while on a lonely lead the middle half mile, not threatened in the drive under
steady handling. HUNT THE FRONT void of early foot, swung out to be four wide when beginning to rally late in the final turn, finished willingly to be clear
for the place, no threat to the winner. DEAN MARTINI forwardly placed while racing three wide, could do little with the winner in the drive, caught for the
place. WHAT A COUNTRY void of speed, steered out three wide late in the second turn, improved position while also not a threat to the top three. EDDY
FOREVER chased the winner off the inside, crept a bit closer in the second turn then had little left for the stretch run. OXIDE went one paced throughout in
lacking a closing response. INSTIGATED forwardly placed for five furlongs, faded. URBANITE void of speed, trailed for five furlongs, picked off some tiring
rivals after the issue had been decided. UGO four wide in the first turn when off the pace, continued outside to be four wide again in the second bend, tired.
THE FALCON moved off the inside in the first turn, raced in mid pack before giving way in the drive. SEIZETHEDAY REXY veered out at the start, raced
outside, gave way late backstretch well wide, distanced, jogged in.

Footnotes
MR. BIG NEWS lacked speed while steering off the inside, continued in the three path into the far turn, worked way out to five wide by late in the bend when
advancing, collared the leader inside the furlong grounds, shook clear then held the runner up safe late under firm handling. FARMINGTON ROAD off a
step sloe, raced back and off the inside, also rallied five out to six wide exiting the final turn, drifted in a sixteenth out, finished willingly to be getting to the
winner. TAISHAN settled off the pace and the inside, four wide advance in the far turn, took over entering the stretch, shook off a bid from SHOPLIFTED
soon after but proved no match for the top two late. BASIN broke well, raced forwardly toward the inside early, two path far turn while still within striking
distance, fell back in some traffic in the second turn, dropped inside late in that bend and went evenly through the lane. SHOPLIFTED lacked early speed off
the rail, saved some ground when moving closer in some traffic second turn, split foes into the lane, briefly lodged an inside bid nearing midstretch then
faltered. DIGITAL in mid pack while off the inside, crept a bit closer in the four path midway on the final turn then flattened out in the drive. COACH BAHE
well back in lacking any early foot, improved inside into the lane, no real threat. GOLD STREET asked to clear from the outside past the wire the first time,
set the pace inside, faltered when headed turning for home. BACKGROUND lacked speed while four wide in the first turn, well wide into the far turn, six
wide entering the stretch, failed to muster a rally. SOMETHING NATURAL in mid pack off the inside, in some traffic into the far turn, lacked a response
when clear. THOUSAND WORDS stumbled at the start, raced in the main body, in some traffic second turn then faded through the stretch. FLAP JACK
forwardly placed while three wide, asked along far turn, began to give way soon after. SIR RICK closest to the early leader, continued to pursue that one the
middle half then stopped.

Footnotes
ALKHAATAM allowed the pace to go early, stalked up the backstretch in the three path, advanced and challenged into the lane, long drive, proved best in a
determined effort. POPULAR KID pressured the pace while just off the inside, advanced and collared the leader second turn, put that one away then dueled
with the winner to the wire, proved stubborn until late. LIMONITE settled off the pace just off the inside, mild advance second turn, proved no match for the
top two in the drive. SONNY SMACK void of speed off the inside, four to five wide turning for home when mounting a mild rally to improve position. HUNKA
BURNING LOVE asked early, set the pace along the inside, showed the way up the backstretch, weakened when headed turning for home. HIGH
SECURITY failed to menace while racing off the inside. TWO EMMYS tired while racing three wide. EXULTING lacked speed off the inside, four wide in the
second turn, tired in the drive. JUNGLE WARFARE was never involved. CASHANOVA last to leave, was always back.
