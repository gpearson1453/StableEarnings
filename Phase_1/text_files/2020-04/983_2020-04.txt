safe as RAISIN CANDY BAR closed. RAISIN CANDY BAR stalked the pace from four wide, rallied five wide into the lane and slowly closed but could not
reach the winner. SLEEPY TURTLE contested the pace outside FLASH BROWN early, continued from between DOCTOR HOT through the far turn then

four wide to challenge the leaders going up the backstretch, continued through the far turn and weakened in the drive. B B'S SCAT'N CAT failed to mount a

Footnotes
G G HOLIDAY moved to a clear lead along the inside through the fist turn, shook off a challenge from MISS BLUE ROOSTER through the far turn and drew
off again in the lane under steady handling. MISS BLUE ROOSTER moved up outside the winner to challenge going to the far turn, continued to upper
stretch and could not match strides in the drive. ZIBBY TOO moved up three wide with a mild bid into the far turn then could not go with the top pair in the
lane. MISS JUSTICE lacked a rally racing two to three wide. GET THE GLUE was not a threat two or three wide. BULLS EYE BETTY stumbled at the break
and was always back. FANCY ME MARIE was five and six wide through the first turn, remained outside and never threatened. STREAKNSILVERSTONE
chased the early pace three wide and soon tired. U REMEMBER lunged at the break, saved ground to the far turn, angled five wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
WHERE'S RUFUS was on the pace from the two or three path to edge clear into the far turn, came in nearing the lane to put TAYLOR'S PRINCE in tight,
kicked clear and held daylight to the wire. TAYLOR'S PRINCE showed early speed inside WHERE'S RUFUS, settled back in the far turn, rallied back along
the rail nearing the lane and was forced to check as that rival came in and could not recover. CLIFF'S PLACE tracked the leaders from three wide while
never far back but lacked a final closing bid. OHTANI followed the pace from four or five wide in reach but lacked a final closing rally. STREET RULER
saved ground and went evenly in the lane and could not close ground. DA VAN GEAUX prompted the pace three and four wide outside the top pair and
weakened. COUNTRY CURE lacked a rally racing three wide. MOM'S MONEY was not a factor. CHILLY WILLIS failed to mount a bid. THE RIDER OF
TAYLOR'S PRINCE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NEARING THE STRETCH WHICH WAS ALLOWED. WHERE'S RUFUS
WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
SHIP STALKER saved ground in behind the early leaders, moved closer into the far turn then waited in traffic through much of the bend, angled three wide
to split rivals into the lane and closed well to be along in time. COMMANDER MCDIVITT made the pace on a short clear lead about the three path,
continued into the lane but could not contain the winner's late run. SMARTY PARTY PAPA tracked the early leader three to four wide to have aim turning for
home but went evenly late and could not hold position. HUNTERS APPEAL saved ground in back to the far turn, angled out nearing the lane to move five
wide and closed belatedly. SHOOTERS ALLEY tracked the early pace three wide, remained in contention while five wide into the lane and weakened.
CHUCKMATE was not a threat racing outside. DUKATI failed to mount a bid racing three and four wide. BREAK FREE was four and five wide through the
first turn, settled three wide going up the backstretch and weakened.

Footnotes
INDY N ROSES settled back off the pace racing two or three wide, moved closer through the far turn, angled out once straightened for home then closed
with a strong rally to move clear late. CHUB'S CHARMER settled back off the pace racing three wide, rallied through the far turn then continued the run into
the lane to close late and gain the place. MAY FLOWERS was unhurried early racing three wide, moved inside through the far turn to rally up the rail in the
lane but was too late. EXTREME CAUTION tracked the leader from three wide to have aim into the lane, lost some ground through the stretch then steadied
late as the winner came in slightly. HONEY HEARTS moved to a clear lead racing about the two path, carried daylight lead to upper stretch and had nothing
left. STAR HUNTER lunged at the break, followed the pace four wide and weakened. JESSICA GLITTERS broke into the side of the gate, saved ground
and gave way nearing the lane. RIVER DEPUTY was last away at the start and never threatened.

Footnotes
FRANKALEE FUN saved ground in reach of the pace, rallied through the far turn to bid along the rail turning for home and went well through the lane to
move clear late. GONE PREACHIN tracked the leaders from three wide, bid into the lane but could not handle the winner's late run. HARMONY GROVE
made the pace racing about the two or three path, continued on the lead into the lane but came up empty. BORN FORCE settled at the back while four and
five wide, commenced his rally in the far turn rally seven wide into the lane but could not threaten late. I'M LUCKY forced the pace outside HARMONY
GROVE to the far turn and weakened nearing the lane. COMO SE LLAMA failed to mount a bid racing three wide. NAIVASHA MONTANA stalked the
leaders from four wide and weakened. FORZE MAU (VEN) was always back. RAZORBACK RED was four and five wide throughout and weakened.
