Footnotes
LUCK OF THE DRAW prompted the pace in the two path and under restraint in the two path, advanced on that rival late in the final turn, dueled upper
stretch, drove steadily clear the in the final furlong. PRAETORIAN stalked the pace in the three path, moved to challenge with the winner outside that one in
the second turn, briefly raced on equal terms in upper stretch then proved no match, clearly second best. DEFENDER fidgety in the gate then broke in the
air to spot the field several lengths, raced back early, dropped to the inside late in the first turn, advanced to within striking position in the run into the far
turn, went evenly in the drive to finish up best of the rest. VIOLENT STORM settled off the pace, steered out to be three wide turning for home, went evenly
through the stretch in lacking a closing response. ROAR OF THE LION void of speed, picked off a couple of rivals after the issue had been decided to make
little impact. TOWN DRUNK broke on top, clear into the first turn, set the early pace under stout restraint, gave way when headed late in the final turn.
GLORIOUS WEEKEND lacked speed off the inside, floated out four wide turning for home, tired in the drive.

Footnotes
TENTWELVEFOURTEEN in the second flight for a half just off the inside, moved out slightly for the drive, set down, kicked down leader. RAVENS
REFLECTION broke alertly, dueled for a half closest to the inside, shook off the other speed to be clear approaching the furlong marker, responded when
the winner challenged late, gave way grudgingly. JUNIOR GILLIAM broke back, trailed early, angled out to be five wide turning for home, finished up
willingly to gain the show. FAYETTE WARRIOR in the second group outside, raced three wide through the turn, went evenly through the stretch, caught late
show. QUALIFLY settled in mid pack early inside, continued to save ground turn, improved into the lane, flattened out late while remaining along the rail.
PETE MARWICK void of speed, dropped inside early in the turn, improved position while not posing a serious threat. YOU'RE KILLIN ME void of speed
outside, four wide through the turn, passed tiring rivals late. TRES EQUIS steadied with five furlongs remaining in some traffic, two path through the turn,
one paced through the lane in lacking a closing response. MARK OF THE Z dueled up front off the inside, gave way in the drive. CEEKY void of early foot,
lacked a rally in the three path. ST. LOUIE GUY tired while also racing three wide. SNAGGLETOOTH four wide through the turn when racing with the
second flight, stopped.

RUNNIN' RAY dueled up front in the two path, disposed of the other speed entering the stretch, responded when confronted inside the furlong grounds, dug
in late to prevail in game fashion. RONAMO off a step slow, raced well back for five furlongs, advanced inside second turn and into the lane, challenged
inside the winner late, denied. SECOND LINE DAVID forwardly placed three wide, continued to stalk the middle half, crept a bit closer turning for home,
lacked a further response to finish up best of the rest. JACKS FIRE BALLS back off the pace, raced in the two path through the second turn, lacked a
closing response in the drive. FLASHY BIZ settled off the pace toward the inside, came up empty for the drive. SECULAR STAGNATION void of speed,
steered out to be four wide into the stretch, passed a couple of faltering rivals while not a factor. FUDGE TOUGH broke alertly, dueled up front inside the
winner for six furlongs and gave way. REVENIO lacked speed, backed up through the stretch. SWINGIN' SAM with the leaders while four wide through the
first turn, stopped.

Footnotes
DUKES UP lacked early foot, began to advance after five furlongs, angled out to be four wide exiting the final turn, challenged soon after, bothered slightly
when MALIBU PRO came out soon after, recovered then took over past the furlong marker, larger lead, held the runner up safe late. COACH ADAMS broke
on top, showed the way into and through the first turn just off the inside, continued to set the pace, bore out badly late in final turn, roused when
straightened for home near the outside rail, came back to finish willingly and be getting to the winner late. MALIBU PRO in the second flight off the inside,
inherited the advantage when COACH ADAMS bore out late in the final turn, came out to bother outer rivals in upper stretch, briefly raced on equal terms
with the winner past the furlong marker then weakened late. GIGGING settled in mid pack while off the inside, three wide through the second turn, displayed
a modest amount of late interest to improve slighlty. KENZOU'S RHYTHM settled off the pace just off the inside, two path far turn, steered out to be three
wide into the lane, put in tight when MALIBU PRO came out upper stretch, steadied, fell back and did not recover. PINSON in the second group along the
inside, weakened. HANNITY off a step slow, raced back, passed tiring rivals. POTOMAC off a step slow, was finished early. MIGHTY MANFRED saved
ground when off the pace, pulled up in apparent distress late in the final turn, vanned off. FOLLOWING STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY
THE RIDER OF KENZOU'S RHYTHM AGAINST BOTH DUKES UP AND MALIBU PRO, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FIFTH.

Footnotes
TEMPT FATE within striking distance toward the inside, steered out to be three wide late in the turn, challenged between rivals soon after, kicked well clear
under steady handling. MR. COUGAR broke back, trailed early inside, worked way out to be three wide in some traffic exiting the turn, finished willingly to
earn the place, no threat to the winner. CHICKEN HAWK forwardly placed off the inside, lodged a bid to vie through the turn, weakened in the drive, lasted
for the show. MACHO ROCCO moved closer on the outside into the turn, remained within striking distance through the bend, had little left. PAY DIRT broke
well from the outside, dropped to the inside when clear early in the turn, vied through the bend, weakened when headed entering the stretch. MS SASSY
ATITUDE settled off the pace toward the inside, continued one paced through the lane. TRAFFIC CONTROL void of speed, improved in some traffic exiting
the turn, flattened out a bit in the drive. HAMAZING SONG raced in mid pack while in the three path, lacked a closing kick when called on for the drive.
CROW MOUNTAIN off the pace and the inside, four wide through the turn, remained back. THORNISH prompted the pace along the inside, shuffled back
along the rail through the turn, continued to weaken in the drive. MORE THAN BLESSED lacked early foot, raced six wide through the turn, always outrun.

MOMENT cleared into the first turn, set the pace under restraint, continued to show the way second turn, drew off through the lane to win ridden out.
FRONT DOOR within striking distance through the first turn three wide, continued to stalk in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, proved no
match for the winner in the drive, game for the place spot late. MINEYEROWNMALONE closest to the winner while racing just off the inside, also had little
for that rival through the stretch, caught late for the place. ALTITO off slowly, raced back toward the inside first turn, moved out into the far turn, four wide
through that bend, finished willingly while too late for the place. DR. HIPP settled off the pace along the inside, saved ground into and through the second
turn, had little left for the drive. ALL ABOUT ASHLEY lacked speed, improved slightly while not a serious threat. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER one paced
while racing in the two path, came up empty for the stretch run. ATTENTIVE lacked a response while racing four wide out of the final bend. CONQUEST
BIG E off a step slow, moved up to force the issue four wide through the first turn, remained forwardly placed into the far turn while outside then began to
give way. THEORYINTOPRACTICE broke in a tangle and remained always back. PER RULING DATED 8/31/2020 RECEIVED FROM THE ARKANSAS
STATE RACING COMMISSION (RULING #2020-OP-34), MOMENT WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
JEWEL THIEF with the pace form the start along the inside, dueled late turn, let out a notch with a quarter mile remaining, drew off through the lane under a
steady hand ride to win ridden out. SUMMER STORM behind the pace along the inside, continued to save ground into the lane, moved out, traffic upper
stretch, dropped back in past furlong marker, game for the place, no match for the winner. WAR BALLAD last away, trailed for a half, three wide into the
lane, rallied, outkicked for the place. SANDY SANGRIA within striking distance off the inside, three wide through the turn, lacked a late kick. FULLY AWARE
lacked early foot, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, also was found lacking when the real running began at the head of the lane. SASSY SETA
forwardly placed outside, four wide into the turn, angled in to duel with the winner from the midway point on the bend until giving way in upper stretch.
ADARI remained always back. TIGER BAIT raced briefly forward while off the inside, beat a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
PIRATE'S PUNCH broke on top, dueled off the inside under restraint, disposed of the other speed exiting the final turn, shook clear then drew off under
steady handling the rest of the way. RATED R SUPERSTAR void of speed, continued back, began to advance far turn, steered out to be five wide into the
stretch, finished willingly down the middle of the strip to earn the place, no threat to the winner. MICK'S STAR away in good order narrowly showed the way
through the first turn along the inside, alternated the middle half with the winner, weakened in the drive, narrowly saved the show. KURILOV (CHI) lacked
early foot off the inside, four wide into the far turn, continued evenly to the wire in lacking enough for the show. LAUGHING FOX broke back, raced
unhurried early while saving ground, angled out to the three wide late in the final turn, lacked a significant kick in the drive. GATO GUAPO went one paced
throughout while racing off the inside. EXCLAMATION POINT settled off the pace along the inside, saved ground to no avail. C Z ROCKET forwardly placed
while racing off the inside, gave way.

Footnotes
SUBIACO outrun in the early going between rivals, began a steady advance after a half in the two path, moved out in the three path late in the final turn,
engaged the leader from the outside a furlong out, going away at the end with good late energy. KISS MORE pressed the issue from off the inside early,
took over to be clear in the far turn, continued to hold a daylight advantage with a furlong remaining, no match for the winner late, held sway for the place.
GOLD CREDIT advanced three wide, flattened out a bit in the final furlong to be outkicked for the place spot. SHOCKING FAST forwardly placed while
racing off the inside, lacked a closing punch. LEMON DROP KITTY lacked speed while along the inside, came off the rail early in the far turn, improved
position without posing a serious threat. CRYSTAL LAKE bobbled slightly at the start to break back, rank into the first turn, moved out and raced four wide
through the second bend, lacked a rally. FLATOUTCOUNTRY narrowly set the pace along the inside, gave way when headed by the winner into the far
turn. JO MARIE off a step slow, was never involved. DANCIN IN PARADISE rank into the first part of the first turn, moved out into the two path, was finished
after a half. ESKENDAR was also finished early, well beaten.
