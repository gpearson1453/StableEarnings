Footnotes
BYCHANCE sprinted clear soon after the start, rated along in the two-path to the stretch, shifted to the rail and was driving to remain in command. R NINJA
J K gave chase outside the winner throughout, and could only narrow the gap negligibly the last eighth of a mile. TOOK A CAB saved ground all the way
and raced evenly to hold a share. MAKINALEGACY lacked speed far back for a half-mile, moved off the inside in deep stretch and finished with mild
interest. WE CONNECTED raced two wide on the turn, and passed tired horses. EASTERN SYMPHONY hit the left side of the gate at the start, lagged well
back four wide into the lane, and went by tired rivals. QUICK CHARGE was no factor inside. FRIED PLANTAINE chased four wide to midway on the turn,
and faded steadily. IMPERIAL GUARD was never involved. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL was four to five wide on the turn, and dropped well back before
completing three furlongs. KATARA PASS broke slowly and was outrun three wide. DIAMOND PORT took the turn six or seven wide, shifted out past the
middle of the track into the lane and finished on his own courage.

Footnotes
LEMON SCAT advanced to contention four wide approaching the stretch, rallied determinedly and overhauled FIAMMA MAMMA from outside with 70 yards
remaining. FIAMMA MAMMA broke out in front of VICKYTHEBEST at the start, vied outside that rival late on the backstretch and into the turn, shook clear
before completing six furlongs, remained in command to deep stretch but could not hold on. MIDNIGHT GEM was forwardly placed three wide to the stretch,
and could not gain with an even finish. TEACHER DRAMA saved ground and lacked the needed rally. VICKYTHEBEST broke a step slow and was
bothered behind FIAMMA MAMMA just after the start, went up to argue the pace inside that rival after a quarter-mile, got shaken off by late on the turn and
retreated. SNOW AND LILLYLYNN was ridden along in the two-path midway on the turn, and had no response. AN OBJECTION AGAINST FIAMMA
MAMMA BY THE RIDER OF VICKYTHEBEST FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
LANSE MITAN vied for command outside STORM THE BRIDGE early, gained the upper hand leaving the turn as the rider took a confident peek back, got
set down after straightening away and was never in jeopardy. KING WADE raced four wide around the turn, and finished willingly to best the others.
STORM THE BRIDGE contested the pace inside the winner, proved no match by upper stretch, and salvaged the show on the wrong lead. NEWYORK
GIANT raced three to four wide advancing mildly after a half-mile, but made no further headway in the late stages. CAPITAN FOFO was no factor through
an even effort inside. TRISOMIA brushed the left side of the gate at the start, came wide off the turn and could not reach contention. OMINOUS had good
early position tracking the battling leaders, but gave way in the three-path before reaching the stretch. MAMMOTH went into the turn two wide, and was
finished early. HOLY KATZ was slowest to begin, and showed nothing.

Footnotes
THE MIGHTY JUDGE tucked into a good spot in the two-path early, swung four wide getting his cue approaching the quarter-pole, took over outside
MYSTICAL MOON in upper stretch and drove clear. MYSTICAL MOON bumped with COLIN A WINNER at the start, pressed the early pace outside KING
LEONARDO, reached the front on the far turn, could not handle the winner in upper stretch but ran on well to hold second. PEACOCK KITTEN was bumped
between GRAYDAR'S RESOLVE and DARK AGES in the run to the first turn, moved in from the four-path, advanced behind the leaders approaching the
stretch two wide, and finished up evenly. GRAYDAR'S RESOLVE got bumped between CAUSE FOR PARDON and PEACOCK KITTEN and steadied soon
after the start, saved ground early, came four wide off the far turn and rallied mildly for the last major share. BLUESKY KITTEN raced forwardly three wide
between horses to the far turn, and tired. DARK AGES bumped with PEACOCK KITTEN early, was strung out five wide for the first half-mile, shifted in
looming a threat outside KING LEONARDO and MYSTICAL MOON entering the far turn, but flattened out into the lane. CAUSE FOR PARDON bumped
with GRAYDAR'S RESOLVE early, raced four wide to the far turn, and retreated after six furlongs. KING LEONARDO set a pressured early pace inside,
faded after six furlongs and had nothing left past mid stretch. COLIN A WINNER bumped with MYSTICAL MOON at the start, and faded steadily after a
half-mile. FALSE ACCUSATION was five wide into the first turn, and never reached contention. CAPE MARCO DRIVE broke out and steadied behind
CAUSE FOR PARDON spotting the field a couple lengths, and continued to see all the heels.

Footnotes
BASQUIAT settled into striking range early, got ridden along beginning to find his best stride after a quick half-mile, advanced four wide into the stretch,
collared CHASING ANNA from outside entering the final furlong, pulled clear under a drive and was confidently handled to the finish. ASHIHAM was outrun
early, came four wide off the turn and finished with good energy outside the winner. DREAMS OF TOMORROW hustled up on the rail after breaking a step
slow, brushed with MUKULWITZ late on the backstretch, advanced inside midway on the turn, shifted to the two-path with aim at the leader turning for
home, but could not sustain the bid. CHASING ANNA sprinted clear early, showed the way through fast fractions with the rider taking a glance back a
quarter-mile out, was overwhelmed by the winner through the furlong grounds and folded up late. MUKULWITZ was in tight between FUGITIVE and
DREAMS OF TOMORROW and brushed with the latter nearing the turn, and lacked a final response. TONS OF GOLD lacked speed early, raced four then
five wide around the turn, and passed tired horses outside. FUGITIVE was prominent three wide early, and tired approaching the stretch. O DRISCOLL was
finished early. PACHANGA PATROL showed little inside. LEADING FACTOR came under a ride early, but dropped back to trail.

Footnotes
CATHARSIS pressed the early pace, challenged outside AWSUM ROAR in upper stretch, outdueled that foe after a struggle and edged clear late. CATCH
A THRILL raced within range three wide to the stretch, and kept on willingly outside AWSUM ROAR to snag a share of second. AWSUM ROAR moved in
clearing just in front of BYE BYE NICKY entering the turn and appeared to get clipped behind, extended the advantage approaching the stretch, fought back
when confronted by CATHARSIS soon after straightening away, got outdueled and took an awkward step while weakening about 50 yards out, and just
salvaged a share of second. MISS MIAMI raced in the two-path on the turn, and lacked the needed late bid. TIDE STORM was outrun early, angled outside
at the top of the stretch and passed only tired horses. SMACK was no factor inside. MISS BEHAVE raced three wide and faded approaching the stretch.
BYE BYE NICKY checked appearing to clip heels behind AWSUM ROAR entering the turn, and dropped back steadily after three furlongs. SOME SAY SO
became fractious in the gate prior to the start, leapt into the right side of the stall at the break with the rider coming off, galloped around the course without
further incident, and was escorted off once apprehended. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE
OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
VENEZUELAN HUG raced in the back under slight restraint into the first turn, continued to position near the rear while three to four wide, responded
willingly under a mild prompt into the far turn, continued to gather momentum under a strong hand ride entering top stretch then swept by inside pair and
finished going away. SHAMROCKET settled between foes down the backstretch then prompted three wide on the far turn and into upper stretch then found
his best stride late and got up late for place. MYSTERY BANK led the way by a slim margin on the first turn then set the pace along the rail to the far turn,
got headed for the lead by FREEDOM FORCE but battled back into upper stretch, got by rival but failed to be a match for the sharp winner then got edged
late for place. FREEDOM FORCE pressed the pace on the first turn then remained forwardly placed to race just off the leader down the backstretch,
advanced to take a slim lead near the quarter pole, sustained bid upper stretch then faded in the final furlong. WINTER'S WONDER settled inside foes
positioned off the pace to the far turn, urged for response along the rail into upper stretch but failed to move on. SOUPER WATSON tracked the top two
leaders down the backstretch, failed to advance along the inside under pressure on the far turn then faded. DISTURBIN BOURBON raced four wide off the
pace to the far turn then failed to advance under pressure. JEALOUS BOYFRIEND rated three to four wide to the far turn then came up empty nearing the
quarter pole. VIPER raced widest in the last flight down the backstretch and had no response when called upon.

Footnotes
SCARS ARE COOL was allowed to settle out of the gate and continued unhurried while saving ground to the far turn, picked up the pace and hustled along
two wide between foes at the quarter pole, gained a slim lead nearing the furlong marker then battled for the lead along the inside of SQUEEZADIOS and
held gamely. SQUEEZADIOS settled to track off the clear top pair down the backstretch, launched a three wide bid on the far turn, moved up to duel outside
of SCARS ARE COOL with a furlong left to run, dug in with solid response but could not get by. NOBLE THOUGHT rated near the inside to the far turn,
hustled up around the far turn then continued a steady bid along the rail in the lane and churned on for a share. MAX K. O. sped to the lead and held a clear
advantage on the first turn, set the pace to the far turn then repelled the bid from LEGIT near the quarter pole, led the way entering top stretch then got
collared for the lead and had nothing left in reserve. WAR GIANT stalked the pacesetter to the far turn, launched a bid for rival but could not reach then tired
in the drive. ICE TEA raced between foes in the last flight and had no response when called upon in the far turn. LEGIT raced five wide on the first turn then
continued in the same path into the backstretch, came under strong handling near the half mile marker but had no response. SUPREME AURA never
reached contention and gathered up in the lane while distanced.

Footnotes
DR POST raced two wide while positioned in range around the first turn, tracked the top trio positioned a bit tight between foes through early stages,
bumped with ATTACHMENT RIDE near the half mile marker then prompted while still positioned a bit tight around the far turn, brushed with foe entering top
stretch, came under strong left handed pressure and dug in gamely still sandwiched between foes, finally got clear from duo, quickly widened advantage
and raced in hand approaching the wire. ATTACHMENT RATE rated four to five wide in range through early stages and got bumped by DR POST past the
half mile marker, picked up the pace racing four wide on the far turn, brushed with the winner entering top stretch then advanced to duel for command near
the furlong marker, put in a solid effort but could not match with the winner in late stages. AMERICANUS led the way along the inside on the first turn then
set a pressured pace down the backstretch, battled for the lead with SOROS around the far turn, shook off foe and fought back gamely despite the
prolonged pressure then had no closing kick left in late reserve. NECKER ISLAND raced in tight quarters and steadied on the first turn, saved ground while
tracking the top flight down the backstretch, headed in pursuit entering the far turn, stayed on with response to upper stretch then flattened out.
RELENTLESS DANCER was forwardly positioned on the first turn and prompted the pace down the backstretch then failed to respond under pressure and
faded. SOROS was forwardly placed in the opening quarter and pressed the pace down the backstretch, dueled for command with AMERICANUS around
the far turn then had nothing left in the lane

Footnotes
NEW YEAR settled two to three wide well off the early pace, picked up the pace and advanced into closer contention around the far turn, roused forward
under steady pressure in stretch run and drew by two wide in late stages. VEGAS KITTEN cleared on top and crossed over to the inside nearing the first
turn, set the pace down the backstretch with MARYLAND PRIDE the only close pursuer, held off bid from aforementioned foe and widened advantage on
the far turn, kept clear under firm handling along the rail with a furlong left to run then lacked the closing response to hold off the winner. MARYLAND PRIDE
was the only close pursuer of the pacesetter down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid on the far turn but could not advance on VEGAS KITTEN but
stayed on for a share. NOBLE HOPE rated off the clear top pair while saving ground down the backstretch, came under a ride two wide on the far turn but
could not muster a needed rally. GO AWAY was unhurried and saved ground then raced five wide under pressure entering top stretch and gained position
without threatening. CRYPTO GOLD raced two to three wide off the pace then four wide into the lane and offered no late bid. STOCK TRADE saved ground
throughout to no avail. SEEKING REVENGE raced off the pace two wide and had no response when called upon.

Footnotes
GLOBAL CAMPAIGN was well rated sitting just off the quick contested pace, picked up the pace on the far turn and raced six wide, stayed sharp under
steady pressure along the outside and drove by deep stretch. YORKTON contested the sharp pace with RARE FORM through early stages, continued to
battle on gamely into late stages then had no closing kick. MAJESTIC DUNHILL was off slow at the start and remained reserved through early stages,
roused five wide into the lane then shifted out wider and got up late to capture show. SPINOFF was well positioned racing just off the early duel, continued a
bid four deep in range in the final furlong and lacked closing kick. RARE FORM contested the sharp pace racing inside of YORKTON, battled on into late
stages then gave way under prolonged pressure. SOLDADO raced off the early pace then saved ground into stretch, moved into range along the rail but
needed more for late impact. BORRACHO raced three wide not too far back then had no response when called on and dropped back.

WITH A BIT OF LUCK applied pace pressure to WW ARCHIE from the outset then took a slim lead nearing mid-turn, widened to a clear advantage and kept
sharp through the lane. ANNUALIZED tracked the top two leaders into the turn, launched a three to four wide bid and showed response but was no match
for the sharp winner and settled for second best. MONEY HOUSE raced near the back then hustled along two wide around the turn, showed interest driving
three to four wide upper stretch and edged up to capture show. CAPTAIN YENNER raced off the pace and saved ground, angled out on the turn then
continued an outside bid and got edged for show. W W ARCHIE set a pressured pace into the turn, lost the lead to the winner midway around the turn then
steadily weakened. AWESOME ENOUGH bumped the gate and came away last at the start, hustled and advanced into range midway around the turn then
failed to sustain kick into stretch run. HONOR THIS was reserved in the back, saved ground into the stretch and passed tiring foes. MR. VECCHIO chased
the pace in range along the inside through early stages then dropped back. EAST CODE raced five to six wide and failed to move into contention.
GANGSTER OF LOVE hustled along two to three wide then faded on the turn. THREE HOMBRES raced wide throughout.
