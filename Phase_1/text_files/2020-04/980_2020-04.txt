Footnotes
AGRIPINO broke readily, sped to the lead while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, kicked clear
nearing upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. MASTERIO tracked the leaders outside a rival from just out of striking distance
racing to the far turn, was prompted to advance between foes into the lane, then drifted out in late stages while just holding a rival for the place honors.
LORD BYRON was settled well off the second flight while shifting off the inside racing to the backstretch, advanced readily making steady progress between
foes nearing midstretch, was floated wide nearing the wire and was just outkicked for the place honors. HAY HAY MY MY tracked just off the the leaders
inside a rival racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch while being prompted to advance in close quarters nearest the rail entering the lane
but lacked the needed final kick. FRIO tracked off the second flight in the opening half, shifted out gaining position in upper stretch, was fanned four wide
leaving the furlong marker and continued with an even effort. DOHKO, forwardly placed outside foes racing to the first turn, was urged to terms with the
eventual winner prompting that rival's pace on the backstretch, couldn't match that foe after six furlongs and gave way between rivals into the stretch.
DRAMA AN VICTORY broke outwards bumping a rival at the start, was settled along the inside early and failed to menace. GIANTBALLS OF FIRE,
bumped at the start, settled outside foes early and never gained contention. MONROES DREAM broke slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JOHNNY U, in touch with the leaders four wide between foes in the opening stages, conceded some position to those rivals racing into the turn tracking the
pace, then made a steady advance in that path racing into the stretch to prevail narrowly in time under firm handling. WILD WINTER, off a step slowly, raced
between rivals from out of striking distance to the turn, steadily gained contention nearing the lane to split rivals bidding for command inside the leaders
leaving midstretch, struck the front between calls late and just failed to contain the winner. RESIDENT, forwardly placed five wide in early stages, continued
with a steady effort just outside the eventual winner to late stages but was just outkicked. EPIC DRAMA, urged to dispute the pace inside rivals from the
outset racing a bit off the rail, dueled for command to midstretch and yielded late. DOC KANE settled outside foes in the opening stages, steadily drew into
contention looming three wide between rivals nearing midstretch, altered course in late stages but was taken in hand when lacking a path from which to
challenge nearing the wire. KING DADDIO tracked just off the first flight while angling to the rail racing into the turn, then gave way into the lane. SMOKY
BLUES, urged between foes prompting the pace in the three path racing into the turn, pressed the issue to upper stretch and gave out. INVASORS WIND
was settled along the inside early and failed to menace. LEM ME TEL YA tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening stages but retreated early.

Footnotes
FORTUNATE CAT angled inwards racing to the first turn to track the leaders from just out of striking distance under light rating, shifted out three wide
leaving the midway point of the far turn commencing a steady advance, moved to challenge for command racing past midstretch and went clear under firm
right handed encouragement. BACI urged to a forward placing while shifting inwards leaving the chute, was rated stalking a rival's pace racing to the
backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn into upper stretch to gain the advantage but proved no match for the winner late. DATA DOLL swerved
inwards at the start bumping WORLDS APART, was floated out leaving the chute, was rated outside foes tracking off the second flight to the backstretch,
shifted inwards nearing the lane and gained position between foes to prevail for a share. TIZ HER WAY, reserved off the second flight along the inside to
the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn and continued evenly three deep through the lane while outkicked for a share. SHE'S GOT MOVES came through
close quarters along the rail leaving the chute to contest the lead while a pulling bit racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the
backstretch, dueled for command when challenged racing through the far turn to the lane and gave way leaving midstretch. STONEY'S MONKEY was
settled along the rail in the last flight to the backstretch, shifted out racing into the far turn but offered no rally. PASSIONFORTREASURE bore out leaving
the chute, was righted to track just outside the second flight to the backstretch, made brief progress while caught four wide midway through the far turn and
soon faded. WORLDS APART broke slowly, then was bumped at the start, settled between foes and never gained contention. TENERIFE MOON was
settled outside foes, raced very wide to the stretch and proved no threat. TIZNOISE tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening half and
steadily faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
ELZABE'S ON BOARD broke readily, shifted inwards while being urged to set the pace on a narrow margin just off the rail racing into the turn, held sway to
upper stretch and kicked clear late under one right handed tap and firm hand urging. SIR HIGGINS switched off the inside in the opening stages while being
urged to prompt a rival's pace between foes racing into the turn, was urged to close the gap nearing upper stretch but weakened in the drive while prevailing
for second. ROSAS WAY exchanged bumps with LIZ MORE BOY while coming through close quarters at the start, was prompted to gain a position just off
the first flight while angling inside racing into the turn, was urged to advance inside foes entering the lane but finished evenly late. SHAKEM N BREAKEM
angled inwards in the opening stages to track the leaders between foes in second flight racing into the turn and faded in late stages. ANDREW THE BULL
tracked off the first flight racing five wide through the backstretch, then continued in that path through the turn to upper stretch in an even effort. TRULY
STELLAR broke outwards bumping FORECASTER at the start, was urged to gain a forward placing shifting out three deep on the backstretch, continued in
that path pursuing the leader into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. KALU, shuffled back out of close quarters at the start, angled to the inside racing
into the turn but failed to menace. FORECASTER, bumped by TRULY STELLAR at the start, ducked out exchanging repeated contact with LIZ MORE BOY,
was taken in hand dropping out of close quarters and never menaced thereafter. WATER PATROL angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight
but soon faded. LIZ MORE BOY exchanged bumps from both sides at the start and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
ACTSPECTATION raced three wide between foes tracking just off the pacesetter into the turn, continued with a steady bid to challenge for command
nearing the lane, edged forward leaving midstretch and held the challenge of YEI YEI under firm left handed encouragement in a game effort. The latter
broke inwards bumping FLYING BANKROLL soundly, shifted inwards, then exchanged solid multiple contact with THE SPIDER while being forced to steady
off that rival leaving the five furlong marker, came under pressure to split foes three deep racing into the turn, shifted four wide racing into upper stretch
steadily advancing on the pacesetter to the end but couldn't gain even terms with that foe. DRAFTABLE sped to the lead from the outset while angling
inwards racing through the backstretch, dueled for command racing off the rail through the turn to upper stretch and gave way late while prevailing for a
share. THE SPIDER, squeezed between foes at the start, ducked out exchanging multiple bumped with YEI YEI nearing the five furlong marker, was
prompted to split foes racing into the turn, shifted inside the leaders to challenge along the rail in upper stretch but proved empty in late stages.
ARCHIVERO tracked the pacesetter four wide as part of the second flight into the turn, lost some ground to the leaders entering the bend but continued
evenly in that path to improve position in late stages. MAJESTIC MELODY tracked just off the pacesetter between foes racing through the backstretch,
angled inwards entering the turn and faded nearing the lane. TEMPLE MOUNT broke out making contact with THE SPIDER at the start, was shuffled out of
tight quarters just after the start, came under pressure between foes racing into the turn but never gained contention. SILAO tracked off the second flight
racing four wide into the turn and offered no rally. FLYING BANKROLL, bumped soundly, then steadied out of tight quarters at the break, switched out five
wide in the opening furlong while being hustled to gain terms with the leaders racing into the turn, but emptied out midway through the bend. PERSISTENT
RUN tracked the pacesetter inside foes in second flight through the backstretch, was steadied out of tight quarters while nearest the rail entering the turn
and abruptly gave way.

Footnotes
ALYDARIUS broke readily, was taken in hand leaving the chute while angling to the rail to stalk the pacesetter inside foes to the backstretch, was prompted
to advance on the leaders on the far turn, came though inside the pacesetter to challenge that rival when presented an opening entering upper stretch,
wrested the advantage under firm left handed pressure and was gathered up nearing the wire once the issue was decided. CLASSY OF COURSE moved
readily to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, was prompted to turn back a rival's challenge while shifting
off the rail racing into upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. ITSGOTTABEMYWAY, reserved last along the inside racing to the
backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch to split foes just off the inside, angled back to the rail leaving midstretch and continued to make mild progress
while gaining a share. LET'S GO BABY, pulling a bit in the opening stages while gaining terms with the pacesetter, attended that rival's pace to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance on the far turn, was fanned three deep into upper stretch and faded in the drive. PORT SALERNO swerved out at the
start brushing the gate while breaking slowly, was settled between foes tracking well off the second flight to the backstretch and lacked a closing response.
WHITEHEELGIRL angled to the inside early tracking well off the second flight and never gained contention. EXTRA SALSA, caught four wide racing
through the first turn, tracked off the second flight outside foes to the far turn but never proved a serious threat. TIZAPRINCESSA angled inwards racing to
the first turn to track off the first flight just outside the eventual winner under light rating, was pulled up near the half mile marker then was vanned off the
course.

Footnotes
EYERISH INSPIRED was settled between foes in the last flight racing through the backstretch, shifted out racing into the turn, gathered momentum while
shifting four wide racing into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under energetic handling. LADY LOVE was
settled between foes in the last flight in early stages, shifted out racing into the turn, angled five wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly outside
the winner to close the gap nearing the wire. FIRST HOOSIER urged to prompt the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, shifted to the inside racing
into the turn dueling for command inside a rival, lost the advantage to that foe nearing upper stretch, continued resolutely past midstretch to regain the
advantage between calls but couldn't fend off the top pair. PATRIOTIC ENDEAVOR tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, lost some position
racing into the turn, angled four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to gain position between foes late. COTTON TOOYAH,
forwardly placed three deep in the opening stages, tracked just off the leaders between foes racing into the turn, shifted inwards racing into the stretch was
taken in hand nearing the wire when caught in tight quarters late. SPEEDING STARLET tracked the leaders four deep in second flight in the opening
stages, advanced outside foes racing into the turn to lodge a brief, three wide bid nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. COCKTAIL SKIRT tracked the
leaders three deep between foes in second flight, advanced in that path nearing the turn to press a rival's pace, moved to gain a narrow advantage nearing
upper stretch but faltered in the drive. LAPULGA settled inside foes in the last flight early, shifted out splitting rivals just off the inside racing into upper
stretch but was taken in hand nearing the wire when caught in traffic late. BOSS OF THE HOUSE broke slowly while bumping at the start, was settled
outside foes and never menaced thereafter. SONOMA STORM, urged to prompt the pace while angling to the inside in the opening stages, emptied out
early. THUMP angled to the inside early and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
JAIS'S SOLITUDE broke inwards bumping at the start, was reserved in hand racing off the field to the backstretch, was prompted to split foes racing into the
far turn commencing his advance, shifted out four wide midway through that bend and continued with a steady advance to wrest command and kick clear
under firm handling. BLACKLINE angled inwards while moving to gain a forward placing, tracked just off the pacesetter between foes leading the second
flight on a narrow margin into the backstretch, continued between foes losing some position between calls pursuing the pacesetter into upper stretch,
couldn't match the winner but continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors late. NAVY ARMED GUARD was rated between foes in second
flight to the backstretch, switched out nearing the far turn, was caught five wide through the second bend to upper stretch but continued with interest to gain
position to the end. OUTSHINE, bumped at the start, tracked the leaders between foes just off the second flight, came under pressure to advance between
foes racing into the far turn but came up empty entering the lane. TOTAL TAP, reserved along the inside tracking off the second flight to the backstretch,
shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and made some belated progress. COLTRANE urged to the lead along the rail racing to the first bend,
dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. DAZZLING TRUTHS tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight to
the far turn and faded into the stretch. SHENDAM (FR) broke slowly, switched out four wide racing through the first turn while being prompted to a
contending position, advanced on the leader three deep racing into the far turn to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch but emptied out abruptly midstretch.
MR WRENCH IT was settled last to the backstretch and failed to menace. NEVANS tracked the leaders three deep between foes to the backstretch and
dropped out early.
