Footnotes
FLASHIN THE CASH was forced out to avoid a stumbling rival at the start but soon showed in front to duel inside CHARMING DIVA, kicked clear through
the turn and drew off under mild urging. CHARMING DIVA was angled in after the break to duel outside the winner early, could not go with that one on the
turn then saved the place late. SAWYOUINOURDREAM chased the top pair three wide and closed to narrowly miss the place. WADABOUTDAREST was
two and three wide in the turn and could not threaten. JUSTICE JEAN was along the inside and had no rally. B L BREEZY was not a threat racing four wide.
PEYTONS SKY DANCER was not a factor. JAKEALINA was not a factor racing out from the rail. PENNY'SDREAM trailed. NOLA'S SUGARPLUM stumbled
badly at the break to unseat her rider, went riderless around the course with no mishap and walked off.

Footnotes
JOMO moved up four wide to challenge going to the far turn, rallied clear through that bend and was kept to task in the lane to draw off. GERDY'S BOY
stalked the leaders three and four wide in good position, bid through the far turn but could not go with the winner. AWESOME MAX was two and three wide
to the far turn, waited in traffic along the rail nearing the lane then continued once clear along the inside to gain third. RUN FOR MATTY made a mild four
wide rally but was outfinished for position late. JIMMY'S MARCO forced the pace out from the rail while inside WHATATRIP to the far turn and weakened in
the lane. WITTS HURRICANE saved ground to late in the far turn, angled out into the lane then worked his way back to the inside through the drive while
not a threat. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK was always back. WHATATRIP contested the pace outside JIMMY'S MARCO to the far turn and tired. MONSTER
MAKER was shuffled back between rivals at the start and always back.

Footnotes
PR SOMETHIN BETTER tracked the pace three wide early to bid into the far turn, dug in through the lane and held safe late. SHADE OF JUSTICE stalked
the leaders two and three wide, angled in through the far turn to bid inside the winner into the lane and could not get by late. BEE MERRY was along the
inside just off the leaders, steadied off heels as a rival angle in nearing the lane, rallied back in the lane gained third late. The rider of BEE MERRY lodged a
claim of foul against the runner-up alleging interference in the far turn which was not allowed. MISS ELISE rallied five wide in the far turn to bid into the lane
but could not sustain the run. TEA AT NOON lacked any early speed to drop well back early, rallied outside through the far turn and moved six wide into the
lane with her late run. G G HOLIDAY was along the inside to late backstretch, angled out nearing the far turn and weakened. PLATTE GIRL showed the
most early speed to cross over and gain inside position, continued to late in the far turn and steadied nearing the lane as the runner-up came in while tiring.
AMY'S SHADOW was always back.

Footnotes
NATTYTYME was on the pace outside OLLIE'S PAPA'S BOY to bid through the far turn and edge clear nearing the lane then held a clear margin under
steady handling. MASTERPIECE DAY tracked the pace three and four wide, settled back a bit on the far turn then rallied back late to narrowly gain the
place. OLLIE'S PAPA'S BOY was on the pace inside the winner to upper stretch and just missed holding the place. THUNDER BOX moved up three wide in
the far turn and continued with a mild rally in the lane while angled out. STRAIT N' SILENT was two and three wide just off the pace and continued evenly in
the lane. BLUE RIVER saved ground and lacked a final closing rally. MEMORY OF SWIM was back off the pace racing three wide, angled in nearing the
lane but could not threaten. COLOR ME BEHOLD lacked a rally racing four wide. PRAISE BE TO GOD was always back while saving ground. MISS M
KAYS DEPUTY was not a factor.

Footnotes
EL DIABLO GRANDE was along the inside to challenge on the lead turning into the backstretch, continued on well the remainder and kept safe late as
SPOON BOSS made his late run. SPOON BOSS settled back off the pace three or four wide, rallied outside through the far turn to fan seven wide into the
lane and closed well but was too late. BRETT'S BOY showed speed and settled back through the first turn to stalk four wide then could not produce the
needed late rally in the drive. MINEFIELD was on the pace while three or four wide and continued well but was outfinished for position. BE STORMY saved
ground and rallied through the lane but could not run down the top ones. HOLIDAY JOKE was three and four wide midpack and lacked a final closing
response. PICADILLY ROADSTER was in reach four wide and lacked a rally. BOLD BULLDOG leaned into the side of the gate to get away last and failed
to threaten three wide. SILIS was on the early pace inside rivals and weakened going to the far turn. CALL A COP tired racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
LOVETHATCAUSE showed speed along the inside to gain the lead into the first turn, continued on a short lead then widened through the far turn and was
kept to task while drawing off in the lane. UNSHACKLED CROSS tracked the winner's pace three wide and could not go with that one while holding clear for
the place. POPCORN FOR EDDIE dropped back early, rallied two and three wide through the far turn and moved clear for third while no threat to the top
pair. CO CO KID stalked the pace from three wide to the far turn and weakened. LUCK CHECK saved ground in reach of the early pace and weakened.
TIZPURE was five and six wide through the first turn to make a mild middle move but weakened in the far turn while remaining outside. FRONT OFFICE
moved up four wide to the far turn and weakened. WITT LOVES TACOS lunged at the break, recovered to tuck inside just off the early pace but weakened.
L B GOLD was not a threat two or three wide.

Footnotes
SCOOTER'S BOY dropped back off the pace racing three wide, rallied four and five wide through the far turn then was mildly roused turning for home and
responded with a strong rally to collar the leaders and win going away. OVERANALYZER contested the pace inside rivals from about the two path then
could not handle the winner while holding clear for the place. WILD DRIVE forced or set the pace three and four wide outside rivals to upper stretch and
came up empty in the drive. BE MY SHADOW moved four wide through the far turn and could not threaten in the drive while finishing on even terms with
GOLDEN BULLET for the fourth spot. GOLDEN BULLET tucked inside early to save ground, angled out through the far turn to move four and five wide into
the lane and gain even terms with BE MY SHADOW for the minor honors. MALLORY'S BANDIT saved ground in reach of the pace and weakened.
SEVILLE'SWONDERBOY contested the pace between rivals to the far turn and weakened nearing the lane. SOUTHERNAIRE failed to mount a bid racing
three wide. LEGENDARY LARRY weakened from along the inside. CHILANGO tired racing four wide.

Footnotes
EATON'S MEMORY showed the most early speed to cross over and gain inside position going to the first turn, drew off in the far turn and held a
comfortable margin under steady handling. CHUB'S CHARMER bumped with a rival at the start, settled back off the pace two wide, rallied three and four
wide in the far turn and continued to gain the place late. KOOL KATE steadied off heels into the first turn as a rival came out, moved two and three wide to
get nearest the winner into the lane, lost position then pulled up after the race with an injury and was vanned off. DIXIE FLYER dropped back off the pace
three wide, angled five wide into the lane and made a mild late run. MATAPAN steadied off the heels of the winner into the first turn and came out, saved
ground then checked off heels again late in the far turn. The trainer of MATAPAN lodged a claim of foul against the winner alleging interference into the first
turn which was not allowed. STELLA MARIE was fanned six wide into the lane and failed to threaten. I'MABARNKAT was bumped at the start, tracked the
pace four wide and weakened. LOVE AT NIGHT was bumped at the start, contested the early pace between rivals and weakened.

Footnotes
OURBESTFRIEND D L contested the early pace inside LONDON LEGACY, drew off into the far turn then held a safe margin under mild urging in the lane.
BANDWIDTH moved up three wide in the far turn to get nearest the winner but could not get to that one late. EXECUTIVE DECREE lunged at the break,
stalked the leaders three or four wide and lacked a final closing bid. ITSALLABOUTYOU was two and three wide in reach of the pace but lacked a final
closing bid. HOLDING FAST was four and five wide, moved up through the far turn but could not threaten in the lane. CRUZ'N JACK saved ground and
lacked a rally. HOTFOOT broke into the side of the gate, moved three and four wide but could not threaten. WAR EAGLE'S RETURN was not a factor.
LONDON LEGACY contested the early lead outside the winner and weakened. HEISAYANKEE reared at the break then failed to threaten and pulled up
lame and was vanned off.
