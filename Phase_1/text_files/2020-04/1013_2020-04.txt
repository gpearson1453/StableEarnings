Footnotes
GO SAMMY GO bumped repeatedly soon after the start, stalked from off the rail, went three wide around the turn, rallied outside the leader and got up at
the wire. LOVE AND HOLD broke well then lugged in early, dueled from the outside, led clear around the turn and two wide into to the stretch, continued
clear through the lane but was nailed at the wire. IMPEACHMENT ACE settled off the leader, traveled three wide around the turn and held the show. BOB
AGAIN tracked the pace up the backstretch, angled four wide around the turn, shifted out further in upper stretch and missed the show honors. GROUCHO
pinballed and checked early, angled to the inside, tracked a bit off the rail to the lane, shifted out away from troubled rival nearing the sixteenth marker and
improved position. CIRCLE THE RED bumped early, stalked outside a rival, came five wide into the stretch and weakened. FINE FETTLE stumbled,
pinballed between rivals and checked in the beginning, trailed the field wide in the early stages, angled in some and went three wide around the turn and
had little left for the drive. INFORMATO chased from the inside, checked near the quarter pole, continued along the inside through the turn, ducked in and
hit the rail ejecting the rider in the stretch and walked off after the race. ISLA'S TOY sent for the front and pressed the leader, went wrong and pulled up
near the five-sixteenths pole, eased into the stretch and vanned off. Due to a timer malfunction, the first race was hand-timed and no fractions were
recorded.

Footnotes
NOBLE GIRL pressed from the outside, kicked clear and opened up around the turn, weakened a bit late but held safely. QUITE A STARLETT broke
through the gate prior to the start, broke in and bumped rival at the start, lacked early speed, swung four to five wide, closed fast but could not reach the
winner. ARRIVEDERCI AMORE stalked off the rail, raced two wide and between rivals on the turn and went evenly through the final furlong. HOPE
PARKWAY settled in the early stages, raced two to three wide near the eighth pole, angled to the inside in the stretch and improved position. TENGA'S
JEWEL chased the pace up the backstretch, traveled two wide then moved over to the rail, saved ground to the lane and weakened. INDIAS LUTE settled
early, traveled along the inside, lacked room and steadied near the sixteenth pole and faded. IZZY'S INPUT bothered by inside rival early, went three wide
around the turn and never rallied. MOTHER SUPREME bumped leaving the gate, set the pace under pressure, lost contact with the winner, lugged out on
the turn and tired. Due to a timer malfunction the second race was hand-timed and no fractions were recorded.

Footnotes
SANTALUZ DREAMIN set the pace with pressure to the inside, cleared that rival while drifting out leaving the turn, urged right-handed in the drive and
widened in the late stages. ZINZAN pressed from the inside into and around the turn, could not match the winner entering the stretch but stayed on for the
place. HEAT THINGS UP raced along the inside, saved ground around the turn and held the show. HOSS CARTWRIGHT chased off the rail, went four wide
around the turn and lacked late punch. DARING WAYS reserved in the early going, traveled along the inside, angled over the rail, showed a mild response
but lacked room past the sixteenth pole. PIVO went wide up the backstetch, four wide around the turn and never responded to asking. BRAVE COURT
broke out and bumped rival, tracked the dueling pair to the turn, angled five wide around the turn and weakened. LAKE SHOW broke well but quickly
dropped to the back of the field, angled over to the inside, saved ground and never threatened. SIERRA ECHO bumped by rival and shuffled back leaving
the gate, entered the turn four wide then five wide approaching the eighth pole and came up empty in the drive. Due to a timer malfunction the fourth race
was hand-timed and no fractions were recorded.
