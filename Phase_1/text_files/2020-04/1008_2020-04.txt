HOOKED ON A HIT stalked the pace, saved ground and just got up in his final strides under all out pressure. HOBBS HOPE stalked the pace, moved up
four wide at the eighth pole and finished gamely to just miss. SARAH ELISE was slow early, raced four wide through the lane and showed good late
interest. OKIE PRINCESS pressed the pace from the outside and weakened a bit in the drive. SMART BOX showed good early speed and gave way. LADY
ABIGAIL was allowed to settle early, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough late. SMOKIN' CAROL settled off the early pace, raced
towards the inside and failed to have a response. SUGARSHAKING saved ground throughout and never threatened. EURODIAMOND raced far back and
was eased up on in the stretch.

the early pace, gained a clear lead in the lane but couldn't hold off the winner in the latter stages. O S U KICKOFF pressed the pace from the inside and
weakened. TAVNER was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide into the lane and had no final winning bid. MR MISLEADING dropped back early,
raced five wide at the eighth pole and had no late rally. KENT'S BET was slow early, raced five wide through the lane and had no response. WESTERN
DRAWL failed to respond. HEPUTTHEACEINRACE vied for the early lead and gave way. JENNA'S GUN RUNNER showed little.
