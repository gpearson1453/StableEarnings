Footnotes
JULIE ARKANSAS within striking distance in the two path, traffic through the turn, tilted out three wide entering the stretch, rallied, gained the advantage
late then held the runner up safe in the waning strides. LIL' FANCY in mid pack, four wide into the turn, three wide into the stretch, late bid, denied. WISH
FOR CANDY with the early pace inside, fell back a bit in the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a winning punch. LAURA BELLE away in good
order, gradually cleared to the inside through the turn, continued to be clear with a furlong remaining, faltered late. CYBER AFFAIR went evenly while racing
three wide. KELLY BE KRUSIN settled off the early pace and the inside, three wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive. CANDYSSONGDANCE
broke back, made little impact while racing just off the inside. DYNAMIC JULIE off a step slow, void of speed for a half, improved with some mild, belated
interest off the inside. HALE'S ANGEL dwelt at the start to spot the field several lengths, raced well back, improved slightly. SCIOTO'S SHOES broke alertly,
raced forwardly just off the inside, gave way in the drive. DANZIG STAR broke back, was finished early. CADILLAC MAGIC a bit rank early along the inside,
was also always outrun.

Footnotes
MAGINE behind the pace toward the inside, steered out sharply into the three path turning for home, challenged nearing the furlong marker, quickly drove
clear. LITTLE RED FROG in mid pack off the inside, in some traffic entering the turn, angled out to be five wide entering the stretch, finished willingly to be
well clear for the place, no threat to the winner. SYMPHONY HALL with the pace along the inside, showed the way through the turn, weakened gradually in
the drive to prove no match for the top two, comfortably saved the show. OWNER'S SUITE forwardly placed from the outside early, four wide into the turn,
three wide when challenging exiting, weakened in the drive. ANCIENT BROWN last to leave, continued to trail into the turn, picked off a couple of tiring
rivals into the stretch, not a serious threat. MS BIG SPRING vied up front between rivals for a half, tired in the drive. SHESHED four wide through the turn,
failed to rally. LUCKY FEVER within striking distance off the inside, stopped while three wide in the turn.

Footnotes
CIPHERIN' SUE forwardly placed off the inside, stalked the leaders in the run up the backstretch and through the final turn, challenged inside the furlong
marker, proved best under firm handling. NOT ORBINARY lacked early foot while three wide through the second turn, began a steady advance after a half,
four wide when improving through the second turn, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late. WENEEDTOTALK moved up to be closest to the leader
into the first turn, continued to pressure that one the middle half, took over midway on the far turn, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker and
gave ground grudgingly to the top pair late. CRUMLIN TIME broke on top, set the pace along the inside, began to weaken when headed in the second turn.
ELEVENTENTEETIME settled off the pace while along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, lacked a response when called on for the drive.
STAR GAZE in the second flight through the first turn outside, raced three wide through the second turn and also was found lacking in the drive. SEXY
DANCE void of early foot toward the inside, three wide exiting the final turn, improved slightly while not a serious threat. BENDI BLU settled off the pace in
the two path, had little left for the stretch run. DARING off a step slow, raced back and well out in the strip, four wide through the final turn, passed tiring
rivals. KOOL AID GIRL failed to menace. ANGEL OF DREAMS fell back to trail after the start, showed little. SATTERSFIELD was finished after a half.

Footnotes
CARIBBEAN (AUS) broke on top, set all the pace along the inside, turned back a rival turning for home, drew out through the lane under steady handling.
AUTOMATE settled off the pace and the inside, two path through the final turn, roused, finished willingly to be clear for the place, not a threat to the winner.
JAY VEE BEE lacked early foot while steadying into the first turn, continued back, saved ground through most of the second turn, in some traffic turning for
home, moved out, moved out slightly for the drive, finished willingly to be along for the show. TAKE CHARGE NOW chased the winner off the inside,
advanced and tried that one with a brief bid turning for home, weakened in the drive. LIDO LEGACY off slowly, raced well back, came four out to five wide
into the stretch, late interest to improve position. SHACKLEFORD'S JOY pulled early while forwardly placed along the inside, remained within striking
distance up the backstretch and into the final turn, came up empty for the stretch run. BIRD IN THE HAT settled off the pace and the inside, three wide
through the final turn, went one paced through the lane in lacking a closing response. CROCKETTS BLUFF broke back, was never a threat. TIZ
MCNAMARA tired while racing four wide through the final turn. NEW MEXICO steadily faded while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE SPITFIRE lacked speed while along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, in some traffic turning for home, remained back.
SHE'S TOO COOL in the second flight while along the inside, backed up in the drive. LIL TATER last away, trailed early, improved position with some mild,
belated interest. PRIMARY PAULA in the second group while between horses, had little for the drive. JERI BELLA void of speed, four wide exiting the turn,
failed to rally. JEWELED CROWN in the second flight outside, four wide exiting the turn, went evenly through the stretch. SAVEDBYANANGEL broke
alertly, with the pace along the inside, continued to vie into the lane, long drive, battled back to dig in late and narrowly prevail. THE MARY ROSE also set
or forced the pace from the start, vied between foes the length of the stretch, led very late,missed. ALL ABOUT CLARA lacked early foot, came three wide
into the lane, shifted out slightly when rallying inside the furlong grounds, finished well while too late and widest of the first flight at the wire. TIDDLY
contested the pace in the three path, extended drive, led very late, cave in final strides.

Footnotes
ROCKSHAW behind the first flight while inside, continued to save ground through the turn, brief waited behind a wall of horses turning for home, shifted out,
wore down rival. I'M CORFU closest to the leader off the inside, advanced and vied between horses through the turn, larger lead past the furlong grounds,
gave ground stubbornly to the winner late. FASCILITATOR broke back, racked back, in some traffic through the stretch when improving position, finished up
willingly. HE'S NO BULL broke sharp, cleared to the inside, responded when challenged through the turn and into the lane, weakened final furlong. BIG
LEAGUE forwardly placed off the inside, advanced to vie three wide through the turn, weakened in the drive. LEROY off a bit slow, trailed for a half, picked
off some tiring rivals without posing a serious threat. SHARP ART void of speed just off the inside, two path through the turn, failed to muster a rally when
called on for the drive. LEWYS VAPORIZER off a bit slow, moved up outside, raced forwardly and four wide through the turn, gave way in the drive. FUTILE
tired while racing three wide.

QUICK DECISION closest to the leader, advanced to challenge between horses turning for home, dueled past the furlong marker, proved game late to
prevail. MISTY BLUE away in good order, stalked the pace in the three path, challenged outside the winner exiting the turn, put a head in front past the
furlong marker, outfinished in the late going. RAGGEDY ANNIE lacked early foot while well out in the strip, raced four wide through the turn, moved out
widest for the drive, along for the show while not a threat to the top pair. COPPER NICKEL lacked speed, bothered into the turn then checked up, recovered
through the turn, improved position through the stretch. MY ITALIAN RABBI within striking distance outside four wide through the turn, came up empty for
the stretch run. BLACK KAT TAPS off a bit slow, lacked speed, four out to five wide out of the turn, also improved position through the lane. KAHULUI went
one paced while three wide. SUMMER FORTUNE took command after the start, remained clear into and through most of the turn, gave way when headed
along the inside entering the stretch. JOSIE off slowly, moved up to mid pack, failed to muster a rally. DEFEND THE ROSE behind the early leaders, began
a steady retreat just before a half. JADE D'ORO was also finished early. RUMPLEMINX off slowly, was never involved, well beaten.

Footnotes
PETE'S PLAY CALL with the pace along the inside, continue to narrowly show the way into the stretch, shook clear when straightened for home, drew off
without feeling the whip to win ridden out. D' RAPPER void of speed while well out in the strip, four wide into the turn, fanned six wide into the stretch,
finished willingly to be up for the place, not a threat to the winner. LAWTON forwardly placed off the inside, waited behind the leaders late in the turn, moved
out a bit, advanced to be closest to the winner past the furlong marker, caught late for the place. WHISKEY ECHO lacked speed, raced in the two path out
of the turn, altered course past the furlong marker, improved slightly. JERRYS PRIDENJOY settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground through
the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a late kick. FLAT LUCKY void of speed off the rail, came four wide out of the turn, picked off a couple of
rivals through the lane while not a serious threat. NASHVILLE KNIGHT prompted the pace while racing outside, four wide through the turn, had little left for
the drive. BETTER CHARGE IT vied up front while between horses for a half, weakened in the drive. SPOKANE EAGLE with the pace while three wide,
also faltered in the drive. BISTRAYA tired while racing three wide. SEVIER was finished early in the two path. YOUVESAIDITALL broke back, trailed
throughout in showing little.
