Footnotes
YOUR ADORABLE chased the leader to the turn, angled in and took aim along the rail, bid inside SHE BE FIRE N ICE, head rival into the lane, gained
command shortly after and drew clear. SOPRESCIOUS settled off the pace, raced two wide then angled three wide approaching the eighth pole, moved out
further in upper stretch, rallied and edged rival for the place. STELLAR WAY traveled outside a rival in the early going, went two wide around the turn,
angled out in upper stretch and got outkicked for second. SHE BE FIRE N ICE sped clear and crossed over to the inside, led a bit off the rail then pressured
from the inside leaving the turn, lost command in the lane and weakened late. IN IT FOR LIFE stalked from the inside to the stretch and lacked a response
to urging. REDHOTNREADYTOWED bumped leaving the gate, reserved in the early stages, saved ground through the turn and also lacked a response.
FAMILY TRIPS shifted in and bumped rival leaving the gate, off the rail up the backstretch, two to three wide around the turn and could not rally. HOPE
WINS stumbled at the start, outside a rival up the backstretch, came four wide into the stretch and never rallied. YOLANDA'S STONE raced off the rail in the
early going, bumped with CAT'S DESSERT near the five-sixteenths pole, entered the turn three wide then angled five wide around the turn and never
threatened. CAT'S DESSERT brushed inside rival leaving the gate, steadied soon after and dropped to the back, bumped with rival near the five-sixteenths
pole, angled in and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
SHARON'S FURY off alertly from the inside then came out early, dueled with OUR MANEKI into and around the turn,, bumped with that rival in upper
stretch, battled through the final furlong and proved best. OUR MANEKI CAT dueled from the outside into and around the turn, bumped with SHARON'S
FURY in upper stretch, fought gamely in deep stretch but yielded stubbornly to the winner. ZINZAN knocked into rival leaving the gate, stalked two wide into
the turn, moved over to the inside on the turn and finished evenly. VERMEER broke in and bumped twice, stalked the top pair from the outside, went three
deep into the turn, four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. NAHOY knocked into rival at the start, angled out on the backstretch, entered the turn three
wide then moved out a path further and also lacked a rally. HOSS CARTWRIGHT veered out and bumped in the beginning, stalked from the inside, in tight
and checked nearing the quarter pole, continued along the fence to the stretch and weakened. LAKE SHOW pinballed between rivals at the start, asked
early while trailing the field, angled over to the inside, angled five wide around the turn and was never a factor.
