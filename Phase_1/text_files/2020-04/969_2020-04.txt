Footnotes
BRANDT tracked off the second flight inside foes racing to the backstretch shifted out splitting rivals on the far turn, angled outside the pacesetter leaving
midstretch and produced a solid late response to just edge that foe in time under firm handling. ENGLISH LAUGHTER tracked off the first flight three deep
to the backstretch, made steady progress in that path to bid for command leaving the far turn, went clear in upper stretch and just failed to contain the
winner. BROWNS GAP, urged to dispute the pace inside foes into the first turn, held sway on a narrow margin through the backstretch, dueled inside foes
on the far turn and weakened entering the stretch. WILSHIRE STAR tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight, saved ground through the far turn
briefly awaiting an opening, shifted out entering the lane but had no late response. K P CREED settled well off the field to the backstretch and passed only
tiring rivals. OSVALDO, exchanged bumps with INDIAN GULCH at the start, was righted to track the leaders off the second flight three wide between foes to
the far turn but had no rally. THE WAYNE FACTOR, caught four wide racing into the first turn tracking just off the second flight, was prompted to make brief
progress in that path racing into the far turn but proved empty in the drive. MONEY BROKER, caught a bit wide racing to the first turn while being urged to
contending position, advanced to prompt the pacesetter racing into the backstretch but was through after a half. INDIAN GULCH, exchanged bumps at the
start, dropped well off the field and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CHESS MASTER, urged between foes disputing the pace racing through the backstretch into the turn, edged forward leaving midstretch and narrowly
prevailed under firm right handed pressure. FREE DANCER sprinted to the lead in the opening sixteenth, then angled sharply to the rail, dueled inside rivals
racing into the turn, resisted the winner's challenge to midstretch but yielded late. CHAOS KID tracked the leaders between rivals in second flight, shifted
out four wide racing through the lane but continued with interest to improve position. SOUR KICKS prompted the leaders four, then three wide in the
opening quarter, was eased off the leaders racing into the turn while angling inwards continuing in pursuit between foes, then ducked inwards under
pressure in late stages impeding ELVIS COLE momentarily. ELVIS COLE tracked the leaders from out of striking distance along the rail racing into the turn,
saved ground to upper stretch to gain some position, then was steadied avoiding a drifting rival in late stages. SINDARIUS, a bit outpaced early while
dropping off the second flight, was fanned five wide into the lane while gaining some position while proving no real threat. DANZO, urged to a forward
placing between foes near the inside, gave way early. GOLDEN PRINCE, off last, angled to the rail early but never seriously menaced. WICKED
COURAGE, caught four wide, then three wide into the turn, soon dropped out. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF ELVIS COLE LODGED A CLAIM
OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SOUR KICKS ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SOUR KICKS FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM FIFTH.

Footnotes
NORTHERN, forwardly placed three wide tracking the pacesetter in the opening stages, advanced to press the leader racing through the turn, edged
forward to a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch and just held MR. KISSES to the end under right handed pressure. The latter was rated between
foes to track just off the second flight in the opening stages, advanced on the leaders three wide racing through the turn and continued with a steady bid in
that path to just miss. DAD'S YANKEES broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside through the backstretch, dueled for command
inside foes on the turn and weakened in late stages. ROCKYSBUCKAROO was settled between foes in the opening quarter, angled out five wide nearing
upper stretch and made a belated effort to gain position. WILD WIGGLIN JACK was settled last early, switched outside foes on the turn, was fanned six
wide into upper stretch and gained some position while making no real impression. VENEZUELAN WARRIOR settled outside foes in early stages and failed
to menace. TARTAN THE BULL exchanged bumps with NO CHOICE at the start, was collected dropping off the second flight, made some brief progress
while being switched out four wide racing through the turn but came up empty entering the lane. NO CHOICE exchanged bumps at the start, was quickly
righted, then urged along inside foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn but gave way early. HEBGONE proved no factor.

Footnotes
TALK TO THE MEDIA, off a step slowly, was settled last to the backstretch, angled outside foes gathering momentum racing through the far turn, angled six
wide in upper stretch and found his best stride in the closing stages to narrowly prevail in time under firm encouragement. DONE ACTING was settled
outside rivals in the last flight to the backstretch, steadily advanced to contention five wide leaving the midway point of the far turn to upper stretch and
continued in that path to challenge for command nearing the wire while just outkicked by the winner. DELTA LEVY tracked the leaders three deep between
foes in second flight, made a steady advance in that path through the far turn to gain terms with the leaders nearing upper stretch, struck the front
midstretch but couldn't fend off the top pair. WICKED BOY tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, conceded some position nearing the far turn
under patient handling, shifted out four wide in upper stretch while being prompted to advance but was outkicked. HAPPY WANDERER, forwardly placed
outside tracking just off the leaders, advanced to press the issue racing into the far turn but came up empty in late stages. NAUTI BUOY was settled near
the inside dropping off the second flight to the backstretch, angled out on the far turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch and gained some position late. REAL
ESTATE MOGUL angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders in the opening half, gained some position inside foes racing into the far turn, shifted out
three wide entering the lane and faded between rivals late. CRUMLIN NIGHT tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out on
the far turn and continued to make a mild gain three deep between foes. MEILLEUR, urged to a forward placing along the rail, switched out nearing the far
turn while being prompted between foes but quickly came up empty in the drive. DEVASTATING MOVE, caught four wide in second flight racing to the
backstretch, never gained contention. HARV WON'T TAP settled along the rail in early stages, saved ground throughout, was caught in close racing into
upper stretch and made no impact. TIZ SAMURAI urged to the lead outside a rival racing into the first turn, angled to the rail once gaining a clear
advantage, set the pace along the inside into the far turn and gave out abruptly entering upper stretch.

Footnotes
BLUE CHICORY, prominent four wide racing to the first turn prompting the pace, moved clear while shifting inwards entering the backstretch, turned back a
rival's challenge racing through the far turn remaining well off the rail and forged clear in late stages under firm handling. DUDE'S SECRET forwardly placed
between foes tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, angled inwards entering the stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place
honors. DILLY DOES IT tracked the leaders four deep in second flight to the backstretch, advanced in that path to challenge the leader racing into the far
turn, proved no match racing into upper stretch and just lost second nearing the wire. VALERIE FIRST, bumped by LIL'S TURN at the start, was settled
along the inside to the backstretch and continued with some late interest to gain position inside foes late. WEST HORIZEN tracked off the second flight to
the backstretch, shifted out four wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance but had no closing bid. THORCERESS settled along the inside early,
angled out five wide racing into upper stretch but lacked a rally. KURINGAI was settled outside foes dropping well off the leaders to the backstretch, was
fanned six wide into the lane and proved no threat. ADONAI BLESS, urged to a forward placing along the rail, emptied out racing into the far turn. J'S
TWOSTEP BEAUTY switched out early to track the leaders three wide between foes in second flight racing to the far turn and gave way into the lane. LIL'S
TURN stumbled at the start bumping a rival, was collected to track off the second flight to the first turn, then dropped out midway through the backstretch.

Footnotes
COUNT AGAIN was settled last near the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out splitting rivals racing through the far turn, angled to the rail to bid inside
foes nearing midstretch, then quickly moved to command while shifting out to prevail under firm handling. WHERE'S OLIVER was settled off the second
flight to the backstretch, angled out to advance four wide on the far turn to upper stretch and continued willingly while outkicked by the winner.
CENTERFOLDPROSPECT tracked the leaders three deep in second flight to the backstretch, steadily gained contention between rivals in that path nearing
upper stretch to bid between foes but had no final kick. EXCHEQUER angled inwards tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, gained between
foes nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. TATTERAZZI, pulled his to a forward placing racing to the first turn, conceded some position nearing the
backstretch to stalk the pacesetter leading the second flight on a narrow advantage, moved to press the issue racing into the far turn to strike the front in
upper stretch but emptied out in late stages. FLY NIGHTLY worked his way to the inside tracking well off the second flight, saved ground to the lane but
lacked a rally. LORD DRAGON, caught in tight quarters nearing the first turn, was taken up while drifting out well wide on that bend, settled outside foes and
never menaced thereafter. NEW JERSEY JOHN tracked just off the second flight along the inside in the opening half and came up empty midway through
the far turn. EMBATTLED sped to the lead along the rail, set the pace on a clear margin to the far turn, dueled through the second bend and gave out
abruptly racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
CLEVER TALE tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight along the rail racing through the backstretch, steadily advanced through close
quarters inside foes to challenge inside the pacesetter nearing midstretch, then wrested the advantage and kicked clear under firm right handed
encouragement. MY GIRL ANNIE tracked off the second flight three deep between foes in the opening quarter, shifted out five wide on the turn commencing
a steady advance, shifted inwards under pressure in late stages but edged a rival for the place honors nearing the wire. PRINCESS LIVIA, urged to the lead
from the outset, dictated the pace on a narrow margin in the three path racing into the turn, held sway to upper stretch but weakened in late stages. LENA
HORNE, brushed at the start, tracked the leaders three deep between foes in the opening stages, angled inwards on the turn to bid between foes just inside
the pacesetter approaching upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. RIA MUNK, reluctant to load, was a bit slow into stride, settled outside foes,
raced five wide on the turn to upper stretch and gained some position in that path late. SUPER TWENTY FIVE urged to terms four wide early prompting the
pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into the lane. ITSHERLUCKYDAY tracked off the second flight while shifting out early, angled to
the inside nearing the lane but offered no rally. SWEET DADDIO tracked the leaders four wide in second flight in the opening quarter and faded between
rivals into the stretch. SAMMY'S TOWN tracked the leaders between foes in second flight in the opening quarter but emptied out racing into the turn. MISS
MARIS dropped well back early. RACINROSEMARY broke in brushing a rival at the start and soon trailed.

SUMMERING pulled her way to a forward placing racing just off the pacesetter into the first turn, conceded some position stalking that rival under rating into
the backstretch, steadily moved to terms on her own courage to challenge for command leaving the far turn, then took charge and kicked clear under firm
left handed prompting. FLOR DE LA MAR tracked the leaders three deep as part of the second flight in the opening half and made steady progress in that
path to late stages to prove best of the others. DISTINCTIVE FLOWER sped to the lead along the rail, opened a comfortable advantage into the
backstretch, held sway into the far turn, couldn't match the winner and gave way in late stages. RED CURLS was settled between foes to the backstretch,
came under pressure after a half, angled out five wide racing into the lane and found some late response to gain position. SURPRISE AGAIN settled well off
the second flight along the inside, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch but had no rally. CLASSY WOMAN tracked the leaders inside foes in
second flight, shifted out to make brief progress between foes on the far turn but proved empty in the drive. DRINKS ON ME settled outside foes racing to
the backstretch and failed to menace. KONZA KANDY, restless in the gate, broke a step slowly, angled to the inside while being urged to gain a position in
second flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and faded into the lane. GLAM, held up inside foes in the opening stages, failed to
menace. MAGIC HATTER, held up avoiding tight quarters in early stages, was reserved outside foes and trailed throughout.
