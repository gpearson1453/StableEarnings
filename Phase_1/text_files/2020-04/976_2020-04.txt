Footnotes
DISTINCTLY SASSY raced four to five wide in range of the leader leaving the backstretch, loomed closer racing in four path nearing the quarter pole, swept
by under pressure in upper stretch and finished going away. WATER WIZARD raced in the back for the opening quarter, gained position along the rail
around the turn, continued a bid up the inside in the lane, brushed with SILVER NINA near the final sixteenth then got by rival and cleared second best.
SILVER NINA sped to the lead at the start, vied for command racing inside a duo on the turn, dug in gamely and held a slim lead entering the lane then got
collared by the winner, continued to put in a good effort trying to hold the runner up spot, made contact with rail running WATER WIZARD near the sixteenth
pole then gave way while all out. AWESOME EVIL raced up close in opening stages then advanced to vie for the lead around the turn, could not maintain
equal terms entering top stretch but stayed on with response to the eighth pole then came up empty. PAZYARMONIA got hung out wide leaving the
backstretch, raced very wide in the lane and improved position without threatening. TOO STYLISH raced up close then advanced to vie three deep for the
lead around the turn then tired in the drive. TUMBADORA raced widest positioned in range through early stages, chased with response around the turn then
faded in the lane. AWESOME FLYER raced two to three wide off the pace and failed to move into contention. AMERICAN COUNTESS saved ground to no
avail.

on determinedly and just missed. LA CARA BONITA ridden along two to three wide in close range around the turn, was put to a drive and advanced to race

Footnotes
KIFFLE broke to the lead then raced under pressure from NOTHINS FREE, moved away from rival near the three eighths pole then widened advantage
racing in hand, accelerated under mild shake of the reins near the eighth pole then wrapped up a secure lead and coasted home in hand. MIDNIGHT
MIRACLE moved to the rail mid-backstretch while tracking the clear top pair, launched an inside bid on the turn, stayed on two to three wide in late stages
and lasted for place. BABY ICE raced widest while rated through early stages, put to pressure and raced wide entering the lane, switched in a few paths
under right handed pressure and just missed out on place. TROPICALITY raced off the pace near the inside and had no response when called upon.
NOTHINS FREE applied pace pressure to the winner down the backstretch and into the turn then steadily faded. DANCING NOELLE raced off the pace,
moved into the stretch four wide under a drive then drifted out wider under left handed pressure and failed to move into contention. MYFRANCESCA raced
two to three wide and had no response.

Footnotes
FULLY LOADED was off to a good start and forwardly placed in pursuit then bumped with WAR STAR near the three eighths pole, continued two wide
around the turn then given cue top stretch, reached APACHE BRAVE past the furlong marker then forged ahead under steady pressure. APACHE BRAVE
sped to the lead and held firm around the turn, continued with the advantage at the eighth pole then got outkicked by the winner. CRYOGENIC steadied at
the start when rival drifted out, took the inside position leaving the backstretch then steadied near the three eighths pole, switched out a couple paths,
produced a steady bid through the lane and cleared show. WAR STAR veered outward at the start then chased after the leader in a forward position,
bumped with the winner near the three eighths pole, ran on with response into upper stretch then gave way. CHIEF WHITE SOX raced in the last flight then
widest in the stretch and lacked a needed rally. REGGAE PIRATE saved ground throughout and failed to reach close contention. GO GONE GONE hustled
along three wide around the turn then weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
KASHAN applied pace pressure to STARSHIP VOYAGER through the backstretch then vied for the lead with rival around the turn, battled on along the
outside to deep stretch then edged away under strong handling. STARSHIP VOYAGER led the way racing under pressure from KASHAN through early
stages then dueled inside of rival around the turn, battled back to deep stretch then gave way grudgingly. GOODBYE GABY raced in contention in a forward
position and hustled along three wide at the quarter pole, stayed under steady pressure through the lane and churned on for a share. R U ROYALTY sat just
off the second flight entering the turn, kept under a ride four wide at the eighth pole then moved in a couple paths and needed more for late impact.
AMADORA shifted out top race widest late backstretch and got hung out five wide near the three eighths pole, chased on five wide into upper stretch then
moved in a few paths under right handed pressure and flattened out. JEANIE'S ANGEL chased in contention along the inside around the turn then gave
way in the lane. TREVESS showed brief response then retreated. SEAYOUATHEBREAKERS shifted in from the outside position in the backstretch, raced

GOTTA GO MO sprinted to the lead then began to open up along the inside late on the turn, widened to a commanding margin while ridden out and kept to
task in late stages. MANE ATTRACTION raced four wide leaving the backstretch, put to a drive five to six wide top of the lane, switched in a few paths
under right handed pressure, produced a solid bid but could not get to the winner. AVUNCULAR steadied along in early stages while tugging on the bit,
roused two wide into stretch run, dug in under firm handling and captured show. MEADOW BEAUTY was forwardly placed racing in steady pursuit around
the turn, came out wider for the drive and got edged out for a share. BACKSIDE BEAUTY was positioned behind the leader and raced two wide in close
pursuit around the turn then gave way in the lane. LEFTATTHEALTAR raced five wide off the early speed in the backstretch then raced along the outside
under pressure into the lane and lacked a needed rally. NO NO NINA raced in range along the inside through early stages then weakened in the lane.
SUNNYMEDE DREAM raced off the pace and two wide leaving the backstretch then raced widest under a drive and failed to move into contention. EMPIRE
MOON steadied a step out of the gate, raced in the back, saved ground around the turn then shifted out and failed to respond under pressure.

Footnotes
SKY CHASER raced five wide in range through the backstretch, headed in pursuit for the top two leaders around the turn, ridden along five wide into the
lane, roused forward to vie for the lead with SUBSIDIARY past the furlong marker then drew clear under pressure deep stretch. FOREVER MARTA raced
off the early pace and was under a drive around the turn, ridden along racing wide entering the lane then finished well along the outside and got a nose up
for to capture place. SUBSIDIARY was well positioned racing behind the early leader then advanced to hold a slim lead at the quarter pole, fought back
when challenged by SKY CHASER near the eighth pole, could not match with the winner in final stages then got nipped for place. MYSTIC NILE was
reserved and raced in the back saving ground, responded when put to pressure along the rail, moved up into strong contention with a sixteenth left to run
then had no closing kick left in reserve after doing making up ground. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA raced in range positioned along the rail early on and
around the turn then gave way in the lane. MY SEBASTIANA showed response and raced in close range near the three eighths pole but failed to gain
further headway on the turn then faded in the lane. FAST VENEZUELA sprinted to the early lead, got headed near the quarter pole then retreated in the
lane.

Footnotes
EXPRESS PHAROAH led the way around the first turn then set the pace with MECHA CORTA not far behind down the backstretch, held off the bid from
aforementioned foe on the far turn and continued two wide with the advantage turning for home, accelerated under a drive, held clear a furlong from home
then held on over late gaining VOODOO ZIP. VOODOO ZIP raced two to three wide tracking the early pace, launched a bid on the far turn, remained in
steady pursuit into the lane, produced a solid bid but was too late to reach the winner. SHAMROCKET was unhurried and raced two to three wide down the
backstretch, shifted out and responded under pressure in stretch run and steadily gained closer contention. SCANNO rated off the early, began to launch a
bid but was forced to steady repeatedly late on the far turn, raced in traffic near the eighth pole then got clear but had no real kick. MECHA CORTA raced in
good position behind the pacesetter, launched a bid but could not reach the winner on the far turn but on with response into the lane then emptied out late.
PEDDLERS PRIDE rated near midpack and saved ground, launched a bid along the inside and raced in contention near mid-stretch then failed to sustain
bid and dropped back. BEE MAJOR tracked the pace along the outside, remained in range and launched a bid late on the far turn but lacked further
response and gave way. RIGGINS raced off the pace then widest into the stretch and failed to rally. RELIABILITY slightly hopped and steadied shortly after
the start, raced off the pace and failed to respond when called upon. QUEEN'SPLATE NOLAN rated near mid-pack, could not gain further around the far
turn then steadily faded. MY BOY BLUE raced in the back two to three wide and never moved into contention.

stayed on with response to edge out for place. UNLOCKTHEPOTENTIAL tracked the pace to the far turn, launched a three to for wide bid, stayed on under
steady pressure in the lane and got edged out for the runner up spot. MOZO BELLO raced off the pace and hustled along two wide around the final turn,

foes on the final turn, waited briefly near the furlong marker then came back under pressure and failed to move on. GREAT KAHUNA raced in range along
the inside down the backstretch and around the far turn then faded in the lane. TOTONO steadied entering the first turn the continued a bit keen before

Footnotes
UP IN SMOKE was away in good order then lacked early foot and dropped back, moved out five wide and allowed to settle in early stages then prompted to
pick up the pace entering the turn, gained closer contention racing five wide past the quarter pole, roused five to six wide into the lane, gathered momentum
under steady pressure then swept by duo near the sixteenth pole and finished going away. R PREROGATIVE moved up the inside to challenge MIDTOWN
ROSE for the early lead, got in tight, steadied, lost momentum and dropped back, began moving back up near the quarter pole then set down for the drive,
roused forward to race in touch with MIDTOWN ROSE in late stages then was no match when the winner came on the scene but stayed on with response
and edged foe to take place. MIDTOWN ROSE held a slim lead then challenged by rail running R PREROGATIVE, took back control when rival had to
steady back, repelled bid from SAMMIE SUNSHINE on the turn then continued to hold the lead past the furlong marker, failed to be a match when the
winner swept by then got edged out for place. ALANDRA trailed along the inside through early stages, shifted out to race five wide in the lane and improved
position. CRUMB BUN moved up to race in range along the outside near the quarter pole then gave way. SAMMIE SUNSHINE lost some footing at the start
then was forwardly placed behind the leader, advanced to race in aim for the lead around the turn, could not get by MIDTWON ROSE then gave way in the
lane. LADY FIORELLA raced two to three wide while not too far back in the opening quarter then had no response when called on in the turn and raced very
wide in the lane.

Footnotes
CHICLET'S DREAM set a pressured pace down the backstretch then shook off HELEN HAYES entering the far turn, grew sharp on top, widened to a
commanding led into upper stretch then held firm under steady encouragement. DANA GRACE rated three to four wide in good position down the
backstretch, launched a bid and moved between foes late on the far turn, stayed on two to three wide with response in stretch run and cleared second best.
AGUAS COLORADAS raced off the pace then hustled up around the far turn, was set down driving five wide entering the lane, continued a steady bid
through the lane and gained show. RUN BLONDIE RUN was unhurried, raced seven wide under a drive top of the lane then lugged in under strong left
handed pressure and improved position without threatening. DUBAIAN was reserved in the back then raced very wide in the lane and passed tiring foes.
GOT THE GIST raced in contention and tracked the pace down the backstretch, remained a strong contender racing three wide entering the far turn then
failed to gain further and weakened in the lane. CATNIP KITTEN was a step awkward at the start, saved ground racing near the back, moved out two to
three wide upper stretch and failed to rally. STARSHIP GUSSIE settled in early stages racing thee wide then had no response when called upon. SAMIS
CAR raced near mid-range down the backstretch then weakened in the final turn. HELEN HAYES applied pace pressure to the winner around the first turn
and down the backstretch, chased on through the far turn then tired in the drive. PASSING MOMENTS raced in range along the outside down the
backstretch, could not gain under pressure on the far turn then dropped back.
