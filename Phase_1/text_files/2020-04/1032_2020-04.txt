Footnotes
THE KAHN, forwardly placed along the rail stalking inside the pacesetter, bid for command in tandem with several rivals nearing the midway point of the far
turn, edged forward to a clear advantage racing into upper stretch and held the late challenge of CIRCLE AWAY to the end under firm left handed pressure.
The latter was settled between foes racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum while swinging out four wide nearing the lane and found his best stride in
late stages to close the gap nearing the wire. SUNSHINES OUT tracked just off the pacesetter between rivals in second flight to the backstretch, shifted out
four wide racing into the far turn to briefly loom for command outside rivals nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. OSVALDO, urged to a forward
placing four wide, then three wide tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, advanced nearing the far turn to press the issue between foes through
that bend but gave way in the drive. UPPER CROWN, urged to a forward placing three deep between foes racing to the first turn, dropped off the second
flight nearing the backstretch to track outside rivals to the far turn and continued evenly four deep into the lane. AMERICA'S SIMMARD, a bit outpaced while
caught wide to the backstretch, angled in nearing the far turn and passed some tiring rivals late. BIG RIG tracked off the second flight between foes to the
backstretch, angled inside after a half and failed to menace. AUTOGRAPH sprinted to the lead racing a bit off the rail into the first turn, dueled for command
between foes to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. MR CHOCOLATE CHIP tracked off the second flight inside rivals and steadily faded after a
half. FORECASTER, caught four wide between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
ITSGOTTABEMYWAY angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking just off the first flight under light rating, was prompted to advance along the rail
when presented an opening midway through the far turn to bid inside PIONEEROF NEW YORK nearing upper stretch, quickly wrested a clear advantage
and held sway to the end under firm handling and some left handed pressure. The latter moved to terms prompting a rival's pace racing in the three path to
the backstretch, moved to gain the advantage after a half, dispatched several rivals racing into the far turn to go briefly clear but proved no match when
confronted by the winner. BETTYB tracked just off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, shifted out nearing the far turn to lodge a brief bid three
deep between rivals but faded into the stretch while continuing well enough to earn a share. UNABRIDGED (IRE) hesitated at the start losing position to the
field, settled into stride along the inside racing to the backstretch and continued to improve position while never proving a serious threat. LET'S GO BABY
raced four wide through the first turn tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, made brief progress in that path racing into the far turn but gave way
nearing upper stretch. MY MASTERPIECE urged to dispute the pace from the outset into the backstretch while racing well off the rail, gave way between
foes nearing the lane and was gathered up in the closing stages. CONGRELLA settled between foes racing to the backstretch and dropped out early.

I'LLMAKEYOUSMILE ducked out at the start crossing the path of CULTURAL MANDATE, was quickly righted, then shifted inwards to track outside a rival in
second flight, was prompted three deep racing into the turn to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage and drove clear.
CULTURAL MANDATE, momentarily caught in tight quarters at the start, was urged to the lead while angling sharply to the rail racing through the
backstretch, dueled for command inside foes to upper stretch, couldn't match the winner late but held well for second. ALLURING APPROVAL settled
between foes in the last flight early, was fanned six wide racing into upper stretch but finished with interest to edge a rival for a share. LIL B QUICK, off a
step slowly, switched out four wide in the opening stages pursuing the leaders into the turn, angled five wide into the stretch and finished evenly late while
missing for a share. MOONLIT SEA, a bit outpaced in early stages, shifted three deep between foes nearing upper stretch and gained position late. SUPER
TWENTY FIVE, in touch with the leaders just off the inside, raced in hand while being carried inwards slightly after the opening furlong, was steadied a bit
avoiding close quarters racing into the turn, switched out to bid between foes nearing the lane but quickly came up empty. DO WHAT IT TAKES tracked off
the second flight between foes in early stages, angled to the inside nearing the turn and steadily faded. RATTLESNAKEROSE angled inwards in the
opening stages prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue between foes racing into the turn and gave way after a half.

GESTURE broke readily to gain terms with the pacesetter prompting the issue outside that foe racing to the backstretch, took over entering the far turn,
went well clear under pressure and was taken in hand once the issue was decided in the final sixteenth. WEST BURKE, urged to dispute the pace inside the
eventual winner on a narrow advantage racing to the backstretch, proved no match for that foe entering the far turn but contested the place honors
grudgingly to late stages to narrowly prevail. STACK SHACK, reluctant to load, tracked just off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance racing into the far turn but lacked the needed late bid while being just outkicked for second. FOXGLOVE, caught five wide racing
through the first turn tracking just outside foes in second flight, continued four wide on the far turn to the stretch and steadily faded. NATOMA, held up just
behind the second flight while angling inwards nearing the backstretch, faded from contention between rivals nearing the far turn. LOUIE'S BACKYARD
angled to the rail tracking the leaders in second flight in the opening quarter, came under pressure early and soon gave way. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE, restless
in the gate, was prompted to gain a forward placing between foes racing just behind the first flight to the backstretch but emptied out after a half. MOMS
LOVE stumbled after the start dislodging her rider but walked off the course under her own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

TOP SEED gained terms with the first flight attending the pace under light rating between foes in the opening stages, pressed the issue midway through the
turn, forged clear midstretch under firm left handed encouragement and was taken in hand approaching the wire. LEGACY AZTECA was rated tracking just
outside the first flight racing to the turn, advanced four wide nearing upper stretch to challenge for command, proved no match for the winner in the drive but
proved best of the others. SAUCY DON, urged inside foes from the outset disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, dueled for command racing into the
turn and gave way entering the lane. HIGHLAND PARK HERO, pulling against restraint while held up between foes tracking just off the first flight racing to
turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then was prompted to advance three deep racing into the lane but lacked the needed late response.
FORWARD MOTION angled to the inside early tracking just off the first flight racing into the turn and faded into the stretch. CAVE RUN dropped out last in
the opening stages, gradually regained terms with the field nearing upper stretch, split rivals while shifting out sharply under left handed pressure bumping
STRATE REMARK and made no real impression. ELZABE'S ON BOARD dropped out racing into the turn and was forced wide through the stretch avoiding
traffic. STRATE REMARK, urged prompting the pace racing into the turn, gave way between foes into the lane, was bumped nearing the furlong marker
while shifting into the path of a trailing rival and quickly proved empty. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
STRETCH RUN AND DISQUALIFIED CAVE RUN FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM LAST.

Footnotes
PATIENT DIGNA gained terms with the leader attending the pace under light rating in the opening half, moved to take over entering the far turn, edged
forward to a clear advantage approaching upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm right handed pressure. DURVEN, pulling a bit inside foes
tracking just off the first flight to the backstretch, switched out three wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance on the leader, then
continued with a steady effort between foes into the lane to prevail for the place honors while failing to gain even terms with the winner. LIL HOOH'S HOOH,
caught four wide leaving the chute, angled to the rail to track just off the second flight nearing the backstretch, came around a tiring foe nearing upper
stretch to bid along the rail but was outkicked by the top pair. EYERISH INSPIRED settled last in the opening stages, split foes entering the backstretch and
steadily improved position between foes to the end to finish on even terms with a rival for fourth. ANTALYA was rated off the second flight while angling
inside early, switched outside foes nearing the far turn and continued to make mild progress four wide into the lane while finishing on even terms with a rival
for fourth. SHOWBOATING settled three deep between foes racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. LAPULGA was guided to the inside
early racing as part of the last flight, was shuffled a bit avoiding traffic racing into the far turn, continued to save ground to the lane but lacked a rally.
CROWN OF JOY switched out four wide leaving the first turn and never proved a serious threat. MAST COVE tracked the leaders outside a rival in second
flight in the opening half, was prompted to advance while caught four wide racing into the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. RACINROSEMARY,
urged to dispute the pace inside the eventual winner on a narrow advantage racing to the backstretch, gave way entering the far turn and was gathered up
avoiding close quarters racing into the lane.

Footnotes
SENSE OF JUSTICE tracked the pacesetter four deep, then three wide as part of the second flight racing through the backstretch, steadily moved to terms
nearing the turn to wrest the advantage after a half and held sway to the end under firm handling. CREED tracked off the second flight three deep between
foes in the opening stages, was prompted to gain position between foes after the opening quarter, was held up avoiding tight quarters approaching the
bend, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued willingly in that path to close the gap to the end. BLAME THE CAKE tracked off the second
flight five wide between foes in the opening quarter, shifted inwards nearing the bend crossing into the path of CREED while commencing a steady advance
to advance on the pacesetter three deep nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. DRAMA CHORUS, forwardly placed pursuing the
pacesetter just off the inside racing into the turn, weakened into upper stretch. OUR MAN LUKE, caught six wide between foes in early stages, passed
outside tiring rivals racing into the lane. FIVE STAR COLONEL sprinted to the lead along the rail, held sway on a narrow margin to the turn and gave way
once headed by the winner. LAND MARK DEAL was settled inside foes early and failed to menace. HOLY CROSS angled to the rail early to track just off
the second flight, was shuffled avoiding traffic nearing the turn and quickly came up empty. CAPTAIN BILLY ROY, caught seven wide in the opening stages,
soon dropped out.

Footnotes
SEA LOVER broke readily to gain terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the turn, took over racing into upper stretch and edged away under firm left
handed encouragement. BABY BOOMER was urged inside foes in early stages to gain a position in second flight, shifted out three wide nearing upper
stretch and continued willingly to close the gap. DISCO DEANO was urged along the rail from the outset forcing the pace, dueled for command through the
turn to upper stretch and gave way late. SUMMER ASSAULT tracked the leaders three deep between foes as part of the second flight racing into the turn
and continued evenly between foes late. STUCK UP tracked the pace between foes in second flight, angled to the inside on the turn, then switched out four
wide in the closing stages while continuing evenly. CLIFFY was settled off the second flight near the inside early but failed to menace. RIVER HAWK angled
inwards to make brief pursuit of the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the turn and gave way into the lane. PRICEY VICTORY ducked out at
the start, raced four wide to the turn pursuing the leaders and soon gave way. UNCLE BUD hopped at the start, settled between foes in the last flight and
failed to menace thereafter.
