Footnotes
FREDDY SOTO was forwardly placed out of the gate, continued in steady pursuit racing two wide on the turn, remained determinedly under pressure and
drove by late. CONGRATS THAT quickly cleared and crossed over the widest position in opening stages, saved ground and held firm around the turn,
continued to put in a good effort then got reeled in late. FELON raced in range then bumped with foe nearing the three eighths pole, kept on with response
into the lane and secured a share. SHANGHAI LEVI hustled along not far back then bumped with foe leaving the backstretch, coaxed along four wide into
the lane and needed more for serious impact. VENERATE got hung out widest of all then got bumped nearing the three eighths pole, raced five wide in the
lane and lacked a needed rally. PUT IT ON DETTI got bumped back and steadied in opening stages then began to move up but got in tight behind GATOR
FIFTY TWO and checked then made a move along the inside of rival but forced to steady again, swung out and raced wide into the lane and never got
going repeated trouble. PRIMO POSTO got bumped back in opening stages, lost all momentum and dropped to last, angled to the rail briefly then moved
back out, shifted out to race widest in stretch run and passed tiring foes. PRICEY VICTORY raced near midpack and chased two wide around the turn then
gave way in the lane. GATOR FIFTY TWO raced in range then got in tight and forced to checked back sharply nearing the three eighths pole then never got
back in gear. DECIDER steadied after the start then again slightly past the three eighths pole and failed to move into contention. BOLT raced in contention
while a bit tight along the rail, brushed with GATOR FIFTY TWO then steadied near mid-turn and gave way.

UNION LANE vied for the early lead racing outside of UNCUT then shook clear leaving the backstretch, widened advantage on the turn and continued well
clear at the eighth pole then began to show signs of fatigue, pushed on under steady pressure along the inside in deep stretch and just lasted over late
gaining WITCH HUNTER. WITCH HUNTER settled through early stages then launched an outside bid around the turn, kept on determinedly five to six wide
upper stretch and was getting to the winner in final strides. NENITA tracked the top two leaders down the backstretch, launched a bid around the turn then
kept on three to four for a share. UNCUT vied with the eventual winner down the backstretch, chased on around the turn then tired in the drive. I'M A
ROCKSTAR angled inside to save ground the shifted out four to five wide in upper stretch and failed to rally. SIGNING BONUS was widest through early
stages then put t pressure along the outside entering the lane but posed no threat. BEV'S STRENGTH raced four to five wide and failed to factor. MUSIC
CITY WOLF was rated in range through early stages then dropped back on the turn. AURORA NATION was outrun.

Footnotes
ENZOEXPRESS vied for the early lead racing inside of AZKAREE then took on the challenge of STARSHIP TAXI entering the turn, battled back and held a
slim along the inside at the eighth pole then found another kick in reserve and pulled away. STARSHIP TAXI broke out and bumped with foe at the start,
tracked the top pair in the opening quarter then moved three wide to vie for the lead, continued in striking range of ENZOEXPRESS a furlong from home
then failed to be a match for the winner but finished well clear for second best. REAGAN'S HEART was reserved and raced in the back for the opening
quarter, showed response and gained position mid-way on the turn then sustained a steady four wide bid through the lane. MAJOR KELLY raced off the
early speed and saved ground into top stretch then angled out and put to a drive but could not muster a needed rally. FREE FLAYME hustled along in
pursuit of the top trio leaving the backstretch, failed to make headway around the turn then raced five wide into the lane and offered no late bid. LIL BULL
was sent out of the gate but lacked early foot and raced in the last flight, angled to the rail upper stretch and failed to move into contention. DANZO got
bumped at the start, raced wide throughout and never reached contention. AZKAREE vied for the early lead with the eventual winner, fought back into the
turn then came up empty.

Footnotes
LASHARA (GB) raced two wide a bit tight on the first turn then switched out a couple paths wider and settled nicely while rated through early stages, picked
up the pace entering the far turn, put to a drive four to five wide in the lane, gathered momentum under strong handling and finished determinedly to get up
late. CHAMPAGNE LADY was off to a good start, gained control and crossed over to the inside around the first turn, set the pace along the inside down the
backstretch then held clear and firm around the far turn, roused for more at the head of the lane, continued to put in a good effort but could not hold off the
late charge of LASHARA. TAKE CHARGE RO settled in good position while saving ground down the backstretch, was ridden along on the far turn then
moved out wider for the drive, continued to drift out wider under right handed pressure and finished strongly. EGYPTIAN PRINCESS raced behind the
pacesetter down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid for rival on the far turn, stayed on into the stretch run then flattened in the final furlong.
BALLYMORE STAR (IRE) was forwardly placed and stalked to the far turn, launched a bid two wide then cut the corner entering the lane and chased one
evenly. CHURCH ON TIME tracked the pace three to four wide through early stages, launched a bid and continued in range on the far turn then gave way in
the lane, was pulled up on the backstretch after the race and vanned off. MESSINA raced off the pace and saved ground, angled out and put to a drive four
to five wide in the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. CHAMPAGNE TRAIN fanned out five wide entering the first turn, raced off the pace then

Footnotes
MISTER WINSTON tracked up close in the opening quarter then was ridden along while responding a bit evenly on the turn, shifted out to race six to seven
wide entering top stretch, responded along the far outside and swept by embattled rivals in final stages. IMA PHAROAH prompted the pace in opening
stages then vied for the lead into the turn, battled on and held a slight edge in the final furlong, kept on gamely then got outkicked when the winner swept by
deep stretch. DARK WEB held a slim lead racing under pressure in opening stages, vied for the lead around the turn, battled on into the lane and was all out
in final stages. WAR DETONATOR advanced to race in close contention and vied for the lead around the turn, continued a bid in striking range in the final
furlong then lacked a closing kick. EXPENSIVE STYLE was edging up closer along the outside entering the turn then raced five wide into the lane,
continued in close contention with a furlong left to run but lacked the needed kick for serious impact. ROCKET BLAST raced up close early on, continued a
bid along the inside into the lane then gave way. BAKERS BAY raced off the pace then widest in the lane and lacked a needed rally. DREAM D'ORO raced
off the pace and offered no late bid. LIAM'S BOY was off slow at the start and never reached contention. FANTASTRY (BRZ) showed early response then
retreated. MY FIRST GRAMMY raced in the back throughout.

Footnotes
MIAMI CROCKETT quickly cleared from the widest position and crossed over to the inside, raced under pressure from close running ZAHNO then turned
back rival's bid out of the turn, widened advantage entering top of the lane then kept clear near the inside under steady pressure. BAHAMIAN PRINCE
raced in contention and hustled along two wide around the turn, angled out a couple paths wider top stretch and continued a solid bid for second best.
ZANNO pressed the pace and continued to race two wide in aim around the turn, got shaken off by eventual winner near the quarter pole then chased on
two to three wide through the lane. GIVEMETWENTY was reserved in the back then put to a drive two wide top of the lane then shifted out wider and
improved position. BEYOND GONE raced in range and chased two to three wide around the turn then gave way. YOUNG RAYMOND was not far back
positioned along the rail early on but had no response and faded. DEO FORTE hustled up around the turn then raced five to six wide in the lane an had no
late response. FLUENT IN SARCASM broke along the inside then slammed into the rail shortly after the start, lost the rider and walked off after the race.

Footnotes
BOERNE quickly cleared on top and held firm around the turn then drifted out wider upper stretch, prompted right handed and drew off. CHART lost some
footing at the start then hustled along in steady pursuit racing in range, continued a steady bid through the lane and finished second best. TALE OF
SUCCESS broke out and bumped foe at the start then raced near the back in the opening quarter, showed response along the outside around the turn then
continued a steady outside bid through the lane. GOGO SHOES raced along the inside early on then angled out and hustled up around the turn, raced five
wide top of the lane then shifted in a path near mid-stretch and needed more for late impact. GOOD CREDENCE hit the gate then got bumped at the start,
raced in the back then six wide into stretch and lacked a needed rally. WANDERLUST chased in contention around the turn then faded in the lane.
BACHELOR'S BAIT failed to threaten. LASTCHANCEFORLOVE was forwardly placed and hustled along two wide around the turn then tired in the drive.
