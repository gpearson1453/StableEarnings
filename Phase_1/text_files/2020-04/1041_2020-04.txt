Footnotes
HONEST GINGER tracked the pacesetter inside rivals under light rating racing to the first turn, shifted out entering the backstretch gaining terms with the
pacesetter to prompt that rival, pressed the issue between foes racing into the far turn to edge forward midway through that bend, then held the challenge of
COTTON TOOYAH to the end under strong handling in a prolonged drive. The latter broke readily to gain a forward placing outside foes attending the pace
in the opening half, pressed the issue in the three path racing through the far turn to upper stretch and continued with a sustained effort to gamely contest
the issue to the wire. NIGHTSTORM tracked off the second flight along the inside into the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn to split rivals racing into
upper stretch and gained some position while no threat to the top pair. COCKTAIL SKIRT tracked the leaders between foes just off the second flight under
rating to the backstretch, was prompted to advance in close quarters on the far turn, angled inside nearing upper stretch and steadily faded in the drive.
SPEEDING STARLET, off slowly when her head was turned prior to the start, was settled last to the backstretch, shifted out five wide after a half while
making brief progress to advance on the leaders four wide into the far turn but soon emptied out. PATRIOTIC ENDEAVOR, urged to the lead along the
inside racing to the first turn, set the pace on a narrow margin for a half, briefly contested the issue when challenged nearing the far turn but soon gave way.
ADONAI LOVE, caught four wide racing through the first turn racing just off the second flight, gave way after a half.

CPL. DIONICIO broke sharply, was urged to gain a forward placing shifting out three wide racing to the backstretch while within striking distance, was

to

for
command
in
that
path
nearing
upper
stretch,
then
took
over
in
the
lane
and
went

handling.
THREENINETYTWO,shuffled back out of close quarters at the start, was settled between rivals racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position between
foes on the far turn and angled in entering the lane while proving best of the others. LITTLE GUY was hustled from the break to gain a clear lead racing a bit
off the rail to the first turn, set the pace on a narrow margin while shifting well off the inside nearing the stretch and gave way once headed by the winner.
PRISON PADRE settled near the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, then swung four wide in upper stretch to gain some position
late. MAJESTIC MELODY tracked just off and outside the first flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance in the four path racing through the
far turn but came up empty in the drive. MYSUREWINWILLIAMS, urged to a forward placing along the inside briefly prompting the leader, steadily faded into
the stretch. COURTING MOONLIGHT, caught four wide racing through the first turn, never gained contention. ROMANCING THE CAT proved no factor.
GOLDEN PRINCE dropped out early.

Footnotes
ROCKY DIPLOMAT, shuffled out of tight quarters just after the start while dropping out last, angled to the inside racing to the first turn, made steady
progress inside foes advancing on the leaders after a half, switched outside the leader on the far turn to challenge that foe nearing upper stretch, took over
while shifting inwards under pressure entering the stretch and held sway on a diminishing margin to the end under brisk handling. HAY HAY MY MY
switched out early tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, continued three deep into the far turn to upper stretch and
made steady progress to the end while just failing to gain even terms with the winner. MOZANO was urged outside foes forcing the pace racing into the
backstretch, continued to press the issue outside a rival through the backstretch, edged clear racing into the far turn while shifting to the inside but gave way
once headed by the winner racing into the lane. IMPERIAL IVOR tracked just off the leaders between rivals racing to the backstretch and steadily faded into
the far turn. DISTINCTLY BREWED was settled between foes racing to the backstretch and gained some position while making no real impression. OLD
NEWS, urged inside a rival pressing the pace into the backstretch, gave way after a half. MY COMPUTER raced three deep between foes to the first turn,
was held up avoiding tight quarters leaving the seven furlong marker, switched outside foes racing wide to the backstretch and continued five wide into the
lane while proving no threat. SILENT MISCHIEF was rated outside foes racing to the backstretch and never seriously menaced. HANDSOME GEM, caught
four wide tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, dropped out early.

Footnotes
BACI moved away to a clear advantage racing well off the rail to the backstretch, dictated the pace on her own courage maintaining a comfortable
advantage to the far turn and was roused through the stretch to prove best. STONEY'S MONKEY tracked off the second flight outside foes to the
backstretch, advanced three wide racing into the far turn to upper stretch but proved no match. LAVALIER settled last racing into the backstretch, angled
inside foes entering the far turn and continued with interest to gain some position late. CHICA DIFISEL, urged to forward placing between foes tracking just
off the pacesetter racing to the first turn, continued inside a rival as part of the second flight into the backstretch and gave way entering the far turn. ETELKA
tracked the pacesetter outside foes in second flight, angled inwards racing into the far turn while continuing in pursuit of the leader but gave way nearing the
lane. BIZ MAKER was settled between foes, shifted out on the backstretch, raced wide to the lane and proved no threat. CALYPSO KEY made brief pursuit
of the pacesetter inside foes racing into the first turn but dropped back early. BAIN TOWN WOMAN proved no factor.

Footnotes
LADY BREANNA tracked just outside rivals in second flight to the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn making a steady advance to bid five wide racing
into upper stretch, shifted inwards once gaining the advantage but kicked clear under pressure. DUDE'S SECRET, forwardly placed tracking just outside the
leader, pressed that foe three deep racing into the far turn and continued willingly between foes in that path to prevail for second. VALERIE FIRST settled
between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out gaining momentum in upper stretch to split foes four wide late prevailing for a share. WEST HORIZEN
tracked the leaders between foes, shifted out four wide racing into the far turn to press the issue in that path nearing the lane but flattened out late. J'S
TWOSTEP BEAUTY sped to the lead racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin a bit off the rail to the far turn, dueled for command
between foes leaving the midway point of the far turn to upper stretch and gave out late. KURINGAI angled inside tracking just off the pacesetter, was
prompted inside foes to press the issue along the rail on the far turn to upper stretch but proved empty late. FIDDLER, bumped at the start, settled near the
inside and never gained contention. ONLY IN AUGUST, urged to brief contention while shifting out three wide on the backstretch, emptied out early.
CASEYOUDIDN'TKNOW restless in the gate, broke inwards bumping FIDDLER, was collected off that foe to race wide to the far turn and soon dropped
out.

Footnotes
UNCLE KEVIN, drifted out slightly at the break, raced five wide early while being urged pursuing the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn,
steadily advanced on that foe to wrest the advantage midstretch and went clear under pressure. BEE BY THE SEA, off a step slowly, switched off the inside
to track off the second flight between foes, steadily gained position between rivals racing into the turn, shifted out four wide in the stretch and continued with
a steady late response to prevail for the place honors. GRAN OLD PARR sprinted clear of the field, dictated the pace racing well off the rail into the turn,
briefly resisted the winner's bid but yielded late. COMPOUND INTEREST, bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight three wide between foes and
continued evenly into the stretch. LEBASI, restless loading, was settled outside foes in early stages, angled inwards on the turn and improved position
between foes late. CHADS CHOICE tracked the leaders four wide in second flight racing into the turn and lacked the needed late response. DISCREET
DANNY broke slowly and passed only tiring rivals. SIDE TRACKED angled to the inside early and soon dropped out. UKNOWTHEDRILL, urged along in
brief pursuit of the leaders while angling inwards nearing the turn, gave way early. CITY CAT was settled inside foes early but steadily retreated while
angling out five wide nearing the lane.

Footnotes
C'ERA UNA VOLTA broke readily to dictate the pace on a clear margin racing well off the rail on his own courage into the bend, held sway to upper stretch
and was kept to firm encouragement to prove best. CREDIT CYCLE tracked off the second flight five wide in early stages, advanced four wide through the
turn to upper stretch to narrow the advantage but couldn't gain terms with the winner while edging a rival for the place honors. WATER PATROL settled well
off the field racing through the backstretch, gradually gained position splitting rivals just off the inside racing into upper stretch and bid inside the top pair late
while being just outkicked for second. WILL RUNAWAY tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the turn but offered no closing bid.
DEBDURITE, urged to a forward placing along the inside tracking the pacesetter into the turn, faded into upper stretch. GETTININTOMISCHIEF was settled
between foes and failed to menace. EARLY DELIGH tracked the leader between rivals in second flight to the turn and gave way after a half.
ONEWAYTICKET, raced off the second flight, was caught five wide racing into the turn and offered no rally. SKY POINT retreated early. FALSE INFO made
brief pursuit of the pacesetter four wide in second flight but emptied out early.

Footnotes
BUENO BUENO BUENO tracked just off the first flight under rating racing to the turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch while advancing on those
foes, came around a drifting rival nearing midstretch and just edged ALBERT'S BARN on the wire under firm handling. The latter broke slowly, switched out
entering the turn splitting rivals, steadily drew into contention nearing midstretch, shifted inside the leaders to challenge along the rail late and just missed.
HIGHWAYTWENTYSEVEN, urged disputing the pace from the outset shifting well off the rail, dueled for command racing into the turn between foes to
midstretch but yielded to the top pair late. FORT KING raced just off the leaders between rivals in the opening stages, angled inside those foes entering the
turn to press the issue while gaining a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch but gave way late. YEI YEI joined the pace outside foes racing through the
backstretch, pressed the issue three wide into the turn to upper stretch, then drifted out leaving midstretch while giving way. GRAMMI DANCE, off a step
slowly, was settled outside foes, split foes nearing the lane and made some belated progress. LOGSDON, urged to a forward placing inside foes racing to
the turn, faded nearing the lane. TEMPLE MOUNT tracked off the second flight racing five wide into the turn, was fanned six wide into the stretch and
proved no threat. JUMPED BAIL settled between foes early, angled to the inside on the turn but proved no threat. ARCHIVERO settled outside foes early,
was fanned seven wide into the stretch and proved no threat. FLYING BANKROLL tracked just off the first flight five wide on the backstretch and emptied
out early. TRANSFER PRICING proved no factor.
