SUNDAY'S VISION pressed the pace, took command down the backstretch and was clear in the final stages under steady handling. MEISSEN stalked the
early pace, moved up fi ve wide at the eighth pole but was no match for the winner. D' CINNAMON GIRL was slow early, raced six wide into the upper
stretch and showed good late interest. CHIRON ECLIPSE stalked the pace, raced four deep in the lane and had no response. MISS TYRO showed good
speed and gave way. ROSES FOR DOUG was off a step slow, saved ground and never was a factor. PULPIT'S PRINCESS dropped back early and failed
to have a response. GOOD EXTREME was hustled along and tired readily.

raced three wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. NATIONS HOPE was unhurried early and failed to have a response. TOCCETIVE JAC failed to
menace.

weakened through the drive. BRING THE DOUGH was slow early and failed to respond. HI HEAT BOY dropped back early, raced towards the inside and
never was a factor. GOSPEL CALIBER raced four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. CLEAR CORREDOR settled in the early going,
