Footnotes
ROUGH PASSAGE tracked the speed from off the rail, angled over to the inside, saved ground around the turn, rallied inside the leader and drew clear in
deep stretch under mild urging. YES I'M WILD pressed from the inside, headed rival then gained the advantage around the turn, kicked clear and led
through the lane but failed to offer resistance to the winner in the final sixteenth. KNIGHT SOLAIRE asked early and showed speed between rivals, floated
in by outside foes then took back in tight quarters near the three-eighths pole, chased the top pair then angled five wide and kept on willingly for the show.
TIZ INDY reserved in the beginning, raced off the rail then lugged out leaving the turn, angled inward in the stretch and produced a mild rally. MELCHIOR
bumped with rival at the start, angled in up the backstretch, saved ground into the lane and passed tired foes. TAKE CITY BY STORM away quickly from
the outside, vied for the lead and angled inward while three deep, set a pressured pace then lost the lead on the turn, drifted four wide entering the lane and
gave way. QUANTUM FORCE off the rail up the backstretch then outside a rival, angled six wide leaving on the turn and lacked further response.
WHATAHANDSOMECAT bumped at the start, traveled five wide through the turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
TOOTHLESS WONDER a bit off the rail up the backstretch, lacked room and checked off heels entering the turn, moved out into the two path, took aim and
collared foe in the lane, assumed control and won going away. JASMINE SKY in range from the outside, bid three deep and cleared rivals around the turn,
led four wide into the lane, outfinished by the winner in the late stages clearly second best. U S LAWMAN stalked the pace up the backstretch, outside a
rival into the turn, swung five wide entering the lane but needed more in the final furlong. SON OF A QUEEN hit the gate and shuffled back at the start,
trailed the field in the early going, went five wide through the turn, angled inward in the lane and finished well. ROCK N DOC raced off the pace, angled in
and traveled a bit off the rail to the stretch and lacked a rally. UNEXPECTED JOURNEY prompted the pace inside, checked entering the turn, continued to
chase along the inside through the bend and weakened in the drive. P TOWN TITAN raced near the back of the field, took the turn two wide and proved no
menace. STARTLING set the pace under pressure from the inside, lost command around the turn and chased the winner three wide into the lane and tired.
