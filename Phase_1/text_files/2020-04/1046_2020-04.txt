Footnotes
BOURBON REBELLION tracked just off the first flight four deep between foes in the opening quarter, continued three deep into the bend, was prompted to
advance in that path nearing upper stretch and wrested a narrow advantage nearing the wire to prevail under firm handling. FACTOR AROUND, forwardly
placed between foes stalking the pacesetter, moved to terms with that rival pressing the issue on the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage midstretch,
resisted the winner's bid while shifting out late but came up second best. ROLLICK sped to the lead to dictate the pace on a narrow margin between foes in
the opening quarter, dueled for command inside a rival racing through the turn and gave way midstretch. WE FIVE tracked off the first flight between foes
racing into the bend but couldn't produce a closing bid. THREE QUARTER TIME tracked off and outside the first flight racing five wide through the
backstretch, continued four wide into the lane but lacked a late response. COMMAND POINT broke slowly, angled to the inside early but never menaced.
THRILL OF GIANTS, urged inside the pacesetter prompting that foe through the backstretch to the turn, gave way early.

ENDUROS TIGRESS, reserved out of striking distance between foes racing to the turn, swung outside foes entering the turn to advance on the leaders
racing into the lane, rallied to the lead three deep leaving midstretch and went clear late under firm encouragement. MAMBO DANCER was settled in the
last flight just off the inside racing through the backstretch into the turn, shifted out entering the lane and advanced in some traffic between rivals to prevail
for the place honors in time. TEE UP, forwardly placed along the inside racing just off the first flight to the bend, angled out four wide midstretch and
continued to make mild progress while finishing on even terms with a rival for a share. TOLLY HO, urged to dispute the pace between foes just off the rail
racing to the turn, angled to the rail on the turn and continued with a steady effort inside foes to finish on even terms with a rival for a share. ITSAGIMME'S
GIRL angled inwards while prompting the pace three deep through the backstretch, forced the issue outside a rival racing into the turn to gain a narrow
advantage, disputed the issue between foes past midstretch but gave out late while being gathered up nearing the wire. MI LUNA broke inwards brushing
the gate while getting away slowly and never menaced thereafter. SOUTHERN N' SASSY, urged to a forward placing four wide, continued in pursuit of the
leaders three deep into the turn and emptied out nearing the lane. FLASHY PATCH reared in the gate at the start dislodging her rider. FOLLOWING THE
RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND DECLARED FLASHY PATCH A NON-STARTER.

Footnotes
I'MTHEKATSMEOW, in touch with the first flight between foes in the opening stages, was rated stalking just off the first flight into the bend, switched out
nearing upper stretch to challenge for command three wide entering the lane, took over and went clear under firm encouragement. VIVAMENTE, forwardly
placed three deep prompting the pace, pressed the issue in that path racing into the turn, continued to dispute the issue between foes into upper stretch but
couldn't match the winner while edging a rival for the place honors. HIFALUTIN, forwardly placed along the rail in the opening stages, pressed the pace
inside foes racing into the turn, dueled inside the top pair to upper stretch and weakened late. DRAMATONE angled inwards while being urged to gain a
narrow advantage, disputed the lead between foes into the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. UPSTAGING broke awkwardly while shifting in
exchanging contact with MY BLONDE MARY at the start, was settled into stride, shifted out nearing the lane but passed only tiring rivals late. SHE'S SO
INDY tracked just off the first flight in the three path in the opening quarter but gave way racing into the turn. MY BLONDE MARY, bumped at the start,
dropped out early.

Footnotes
SASSY MISS MARGIE was rated between rivals in second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted three deep after a half, steadily advanced on the
pacesetter in that path racing into the far turn, wrested the advantage nearing midstretch, went clear under firm encouragement and was taken in hand
nearing the wire. JACKIES DREAM, off a step behind the leaders, tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide
racing into the far turn to advance on the leaders but couldn't gain terms with the winner while proving best of the others. MALICED, urged along the rail
disputing the pace into the backstretch, edged forward to a clear advantage racing into the far turn, dueled inside the winner into upper stretch and gave
way late. WICKED WITCH tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight, shifted out to lodge a brief bid between foes racing into the far turn
but came up empty entering the lane. SUDDEN LIGHT broke in the air losing position at the start, was settled between foes in the last flight but lacked a
rally. REINA LA KELSY was settled inside foes in the last flight and never gained contention. MIA ANGELINA tracked the leaders three, then four wide as
part of the second flight racing to the far turn but soon emptied out. TRACK MAGIC, urged to terms with the leader prompting the pace racing to the first turn
into the backstretch, gave way after a half.

PROFESSIONAL came through close quarters to gain a position just off the pacesetter inside rivals racing into the first turn, switched off the rail nearing the
backstretch while being rated between foes tracking just off the leaders, continued under patient handling conceding some position nearing the second
bend, shifted inside foes to advance, then switched outside the pacesetter racing through the far turn, moved to challenge for command nearing upper
stretch and edged forward late under firm handling. PADDY O'DINI tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing into the first turn, angled to
the rail when presented an opening entering the backstretch, was prompted to challenge for command inside the leaders racing into the far turn, contested
the issue along the rail into upper stretch but proved no match late. SINDARIUS, urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, shifted
out on the backstretch disputing the issue off the rail, continued in pursuit of the top pair three deep into the lane but faded in the drive. FLIGHT DECK
settled between foes off the second flight and split foes to gain some position in late stages while no real threat. ROSAS WAY, forwardly placed three deep
between foes tracking just off the pacesetter to the first turn, advanced in that path to prompt that foe entering the backstretch but gave way racing into the
far turn. FAST FLYING FRED, caught four wide in second flight racing through the first turn, continued outside foes on the backstretch, steadily faded
nearing the second bend, then was vanned off the course following the race. VINTNER was a brief factor between foes racing in second flight into the first
turn, shifted out conceding some position nearing the backstretch and soon gave way. CHARLIES A CHARMER caught wide to the first turn tracking off the
second flight, never mounted a serious challenge.

RETURN THE FAVOR was hustled clear from the break while switching well off the rail setting the pace, held sway on a comfortable margin remaining off
the inside to the stretch and was kept to pressure. ROMANTIC GIZMO, off a step slowly, recovered to track the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the
second flight racing into the turn, shifted out entering the lane and prevailed for the place honors. HER NAME IS STAR tracked off the second flight between
foes racing into the turn, advanced to split foes while shifting out three wide racing into the stretch and continued with interest. ADONAI BLESS tracked the
pacesetter four wide between foes in early stages, angled to the inside nearing the lane and continued with an even effort. QUEENS WORLD, a bit slow into
stride, settled well back in early stages, shifted out five wide racing through the stretch and improved position late. MS. GENUINE, caught five wide in the
opening stages, was prompted in pursuit of the pacesetter four wide into the turn but soon faded. LONG STORY SHORT, restless in the gate before the
start, never proved a factor. R LOVELY JULZ bobbled at the start, was briskly roused pursuing the pacesetter into the turn and gave way abruptly racing
into upper stretch.

Footnotes
KWAINA was urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset while shifting off the rail racing into the turn, edged forward into upper stretch, shifted to
the rail in the closing stages but held ANIMAUXSELLE on a safe margin to the end under brisk handling. The latter tracked off the first flight between foes
under light rating racing to the turn, shifted inside rivals to advance on the pacesetter nearing the lane, switched outside that foe to challenge nearing
midstretch but couldn't gain even terms. CANDY FOR ALL, caught six wide in the opening stages tracking off the first flight, continued four wide into the
bend tracking just outside the leaders, angled inwards racing into the stretch and edged a rival for a share. MANCORA was urged to prompt the pace three
wide racing into the turn and faded in that path through late stages. MEMORABLE ANGEL tracked off the second flight four wide between foes in early
stages and offered no rally. RISEN CHANGE broke awkwardly, angled to the inside early, was prompted to make brief progress along the rail after the
opening quarter but came up empty racing into the turn. MY COTTON CANDY proved no factor. VICTORY SPELL flashed brief pace between foes in the
opening quarter, continued in pursuit of the leaders between foes into the turn but steadily retreated nearing the lane.

Footnotes
BLAME BISHOP, urged to the lead from the outset while shifting off the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn, edged away to a clear
advantage nearing upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. ESOR, in touch prompting the eventual winner's pace racing into the
turn, proved no match late. KINGS HIGHWAY came through tight quarters at the break, angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes racing into
the turn, then angled to the rail in the closing stages while continuing with interest to prevail for a share. IMPERIAL GREATNESS tracked off the first flight
five wide through the backstretch into the turn and made an effort to improve position late. MISTER MISTER tracked just off the first flight racing four wide
into the turn and faded into the stretch. DRILL DOWN angled to the inside early to track behind the second flight but offered no rally. NOT TELLING tracked
off the second flight three wide between foes and failed to menace. COOL RIVER DS settled outside foes racing six wide through the backstretch and
proved no threat. BOLTER broke slowly, then was bumped at the start, switched out to race between foes into the turn, then was fanned six wide late while
never gaining contention. TOMMY TUESDAY angled to the inside early while making brief pursuit of the leaders into the turn and emptied out nearing the
lane. ARES WARRIOR proved no factor. STERLING JUDGE switched out widest on the backstretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RECODED took up a position racing just behind the leaders while switching off the inside racing through the backstretch, commenced her advance four
wide between foes leaving the midway point of the turn, wrested the advantage in that path entering upper stretch and went clear under firm left handed
encouragement. LILY CHASER was urged disputing the pace from the outset while shifting off the rail, dueled for command between foes on a narrow
advantage to upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. FLASH FLOOD, reserved last racing in the three path early, gathered
momentum leaving the midway point of the turn, swung out six wide entering the stretch and produced her best stride late to prevail for a share. MISTY
EXPRESS, in touch between foes in the first flight, angled to the inside after the opening furlong to prompt the pace inside foes, pressed the issue through
the turn and weakened into upper stretch. MILLE FLEURS bobbled at the start, switched out in early stages dropping well off the second flight, was
prompted to make steady progress racing into the turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch and finished evenly. TOTALLY PERFECT, shuffled back at the
start, angled to the inside in early stages, made brief progress along the inside on the turn to gain contention in upper stretch but flattened out late.
WROTE'S GIFT, caught five wide between foes in the last flight early, failed to menace. SKI BUNNY gained a position just outside the eventual winner
racing as part of the second flight, made brief progress in tandem with that rival racing five wide through the turn but came up empty entering the lane.
POKEGAMA broke readily to prompt the pace three deep racing into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. FOREVERNOA, off a step slowly, raced wide
throughout while proving no factor. BLUEJEANLADY dropped out early.
