Footnotes
COUNTRY DREAM moved up to vie between horses before a quarter, gained the advantage midway on the bend, larger lead upper stretch, held the runner
up safe the final furlong under steady handling, clear again late. JOY IN THE JOURNEY forwardly placed outside, advanced four down to three wide turn,
challenged the winner from the outside nearing the furlong grounds, could not keep up with that one late, clearly second best. SUPERSTAR BEA back off
the pace, in the two path exiting the turn while in some traffic, rallied for the show, no threat to the top two. MICHELLE'S GRACE in mid pack early along the
inside, steered out to be three wide into the lane, continued one paced to the wire in lacking a closing kick. SHE'S A QUEEN forwardly placed while racing
off the inside, pressed the issue three down to two wide through the turn and began to weaken. LANEYS LOVE in the main body early, moved out to be
three wide by late in the turn, failed to muster a rally. DADDY'S ANGEL lacked speed off the inside, improved a bit late in the turn, failed to sustain that
advance in the drive. SHOOT ME STRAIGHT off a step slow, failed to menace while saving ground. SEASIDE SURPRISE lacked speed outside, swung out
to be five wide turning for home, also found lacking in the stretch. OWE HER ONE broke back and was always outrun. ANOTHER ROCKET flashed brief
speed along the inside and gave way. WEWOKA fell back to trail after the start, showed little.

Footnotes
CHINA CAT in the second flight while three wide, angled in a bit far turn, still had considerable ground to make up on the leader with a furlong remaining,
late surge outside to get up in time. REVEALING QUALITY prompted the leader off the inside, continued to pursue that rival up the backstretch, advanced
and gained the lead late n the second turn, held a sizable advantage past the furlong marker then could not contain the winner late. HUNGRY N SCRAPPY
away in good order, showed the way into the first turn along the inside, stayed the clear the middle half, offered brief resistance to the runner up when that
one challenged in the final turn then could not keep up in the drive, also no match for the winner. BIG LUCK void of early foot, began to advance four wide
into the far turn, three wide into the lane, improved position while never a serious threat. A REAL GEM lacked speed for a half, improved with a three wide
move through the final turn, flattened out in the drive. UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY four wide into the first turn, angled in to be two wide onto the backstretch,
continued in mid pack off the rail, failed to respond in the drive. LIL RESPECT settled off the pace, dropped inside second turn, no bid. GYPSY WIND
JEANNE went one paced in the two path. PLUS SIZE VALUE lacked speed outside and four wide into the first turn, continued back and wide, five path into
the far bend, no kick. LILFEATHEREDINDIAN five wide into the first turn, was never involved. SUITS ME was finished early. SLOVAK forwardly placed in
the early going, gave way in the far turn, pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
DULCE RIDE set the early pace along the inside, dueled into the stretch, put that rival away late then had enough left to gain the nod at the wire. TRACI'S
GREELEY in the main body in the run up the backstretch along the inside, angled out to be four wide late in the turn, rallied well out in the strip, finished up
willingly to narrowly miss. MIZ NIGHTCAP forwardly placed off the inside, advanced and challenged the winner midway on the turn, raced on equal terms
with that one into the lane, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, headed by the winner late, outfinished by both that rival and the runner up at
the wire. GIRL FROM BERLIN broke back, lacked speed, came four wide out of the turn, finished with some interest to improve position, not a threat to the
top three. HEFFINGTON off a step slow, raced well back early, two path through much of the turn, steered to the rail when straightened for home, improved
position. WILD DEZ pressed the winner early in the two path, began to retreat before a half. BE AUTHENTIC lacked speed, moved inside for the drive,
saved some ground, failed to respond when called on for the drive. PRIMARY PAULA forwardly placed while four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, tired.
WESTERN ATTIRE four wide trip, was not a factor. JUST FOR CASEY was finished before a half while racing inside. SETTLE IT broke back and was never
close. PORTION in some traffic when with the main body into the turn, three wide around the bend then backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
FUDGE TOUGH with the pace from the start, vied between foes the middle half, dueled into the stretch, kicked clear late under firm handling. GOLDEN
RULE HAVEN back off the early pace while saving ground, moved out to be three wide exiting the final turn, steered out widest for the drive, finished with
good energy midtrack to be up for the place. JASIRI tucked toward the inside early first turn to save some ground, in hand, steadied in tight quarters into the
far turn, recovered, behind traffic into and through much of upper stretch, split foes with less than a furlong remaining and improved position. BIG BIZ with
the pace while racing with the pace three wide, dueled outside the winner turning for home, faltered in the late going to lose a couple of positions.
UNIMAGINABLE U four wide through the first turn, continued to track the pace outside, four wide into the second turn, went evenly through the stretch.
AGITATOR broke back, void of early foot, moved out around a tiring foe on the rail late in the second turn, improved position with some mild, belated
interest. RUNTECH five wide through the first turn when forwardly placed, continued well out in the strip, four wide through the second bend, came up
empty for the stretch run. TIME IS NOW fractious in the gate, raced back and inside, failed to muster a rally when asked. REACH THE MOON in the second
flight inside, raced in the two path while remaining within striking position second turn, had little left for the stretch run and he steadily faded. TRANQUILITY
BASE five wide into the first turn, well wide up the back, moved a bit closer while continuing in the five path second turn, weakened late. AUBEY RIDGE
broke on top, set the pace inside, gave way. PRIMORDIAL BOY was always outrun.

Footnotes
DEVILS HALO allowed the pace to go early, advanced and collared the leader from the outside past the furlong marker, drove clear. WEAST HILL behind
the pace while off the inside, came four wide out of the turn, rallied to gain the place spot, not a threat to the winer. NIIGON'S GLORY settled off the leaders
and the inside, raced three wide out of the turn, was along for the show. RAVENS REFLECTION broke alertly, vied up front three wide, disposed of the
other speed when straightened for home to be briefly clear, faltered when headed by the winner a furlong out. SUSPECT A STORM one paced off the
inside, roused four wide exiting the turn, lacked a serious response to finish up evenly. VIRGA lacked early foot, raced four wide through the turn, made little
impact in the drive. HOLDTHISMISS broke back, raced inside, improved position slightly, no real threat. EL VENUE vied up front closest to the inside for
three furlongs and gave way. WHEN I DO well back while off the in side, was never a threat. GIANT PULPIT off a step slow, trailed most of the way to be
never close. ROCKYS WARRIOR with the pace while between horses, dueled out of the turn, pulled up in apparent distress soon after, vanned off.

Footnotes
SHESHED chased the early leader from along the inside, stopped in the turn. SHE BE ADDIE off slow, raced back, saved ground to no avail. COWGIRL
KIMMIE off slowly, trailed much of the way, picked off some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. D'TATWAY in mid pack early, steadily faded.
LEADING INDICATOR in the second flight early inside, moved around a tiring rival along the rail midway on the turn, came up empty for the drive. ADARI
off slowly, angled in for the run into the turn, failed to respond when called on for the drive. ISABELLE'S JOY went one paced while racing toward the inside.
SOUTHERN CENTS void of speed, came five wide out of the turn, found best stride too late midtrack. SWEET CARLI outrun early while well out in the strip,
four wide into the turn, angled out slightly to be five wide into the stretch, set down soon after, closed with good resolve down the middle of the strip to be up
in time. SASSY SETA in the second flight off the inside, three wide advance exiting the turn, collared the tiring leader just inside the furlong grounds, led
late, caught in the final strides by the winner. LOVE MY HONEY broke alertly, set the pace off the inside, clear into the stretch, could not last. ITALIAN
JUSTICE back off the pace well out in the strip, continued four wide through the turn, went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing response.

Footnotes
FINAL FORM stalked the pace while racing three wide, moved to challenge out of the turn, extended duel to the wire, wore down foe under firm handling.
TRUE CASTLE pressed the leader from the outside, challenged that one late in the turn, showed the way into the stretch, responded when the winner came
alongside soon after, proved stubborn to the end. SHAHARAZAD lacked early foot, angled toward the inside into the turn, came three wide into the lane,
proved no match for the top two late. BOATHOUSE VIEW lacked early foot, improved by picking way through some traffic three wide in the turn, shifted out
a bit for the drive and flattened out to finish up evenly. ENJAY'S BRASS in the second group while racing outside, five wide through most of the bend, four
wide into the lane, lacked a closing punch. SOPHIE'S ANGEL pinched back at the start, circled six wide into the lane, improved a bit while not a serious
threat. FAIRWAYNGREEN away in good order, set the pace for three furlongs closest to the inside, began to weaken when headed late in the turn. SILKEN
GOODS forwardly placed along the inside, gave way in the drive. MADISON WAY failed to menace while racing off the inside. SAUCY AT MIDNIGHT void
of speed, remained always back. DOUBLE BEE STING broke out, raced four wide through the turn, was finished early. MIDNIGHT SWAY steadily faded
after racing forwardly and four wide into the turn, pulled up in apparent distress, vanned off.

Footnotes
CROWN JEWEL stalked the pace three wide, bid turning for home, quickly clear, ridden out in a sharp effort. TIPSY GAL back off the pace while outside,
continued four wide through the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, held sway for the place. TRAPPED N MY MIND behind the pace toward
the inside early, tipped out to be five wide exiting the turn, mild late interest to annex the show. GOT A GOOD NOTION last to leave, raced back, two path
into the lane, improved position not a serious threat. SLIME QUEEN void of speed off the inside, three wide through the turn, displayed some mild interest to
also improve position. LIL MISS MOPPET pressed the early leader off the inside, advanced to duel with that one through the turn, showed the way late in
the turn then faltered when headed by the winner. DIXIE NATION made little impact while racing toward the inside. FREEDOM PASSAGE brushed in the
early going while in some traffic, raced back and failed to threaten. TIPAZAR in tight quarters the opening furlong, steadied slightly, three wide turn, lacked a
response in the drive. POLARCENTS tired while racing four wide. BLIP SAYS BYE broke sharp, showed the way up the backstretch, gave way when
headed in the dturn. AND ISLES brushed when in tight early, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
EDGEWAY within striking distance early while outside, four wide through the turn when creeping closer, bid, took over when straightened for home, edged
clear past the furlong marker and held the runner up at bay under steady handling. CHARMING LADY back off the early pace, worked way out to the three
path by late in the turn when advancing, chased the winner past the furlong marker, could not do much with that foe late, clearly second best. HIGH ON GIN
void of speed while steadying early in some traffic, moved outside, four out to six wide through the turn, finished up willingly to be well clear of the others.
SASSY SENECA away well, set or forced the pace off the inside, faltered when headed turning for home. MARYANORGINGER within striking distance
while racing outside, laced a closing kick. BANKER'S CANDY void of speed outside, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, improved position without
posing a serious threat. SEKANI settled in mid pack while racing in the two path, had little left for the drive. MISTY BLUE alternated up front while along the
inside for a half and faltered. WASABI GIRL forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch along the inside, began a steady retreat before a half. CLASSY
BEAST off the pace outside, four wide into the turn, tired from those early efforts. NAUTICAL GEM was never a factor. MONEDAS DE ORO off slowly,
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
INTHEMIDSTOFBIZ dueled up front while racing off the inside, pulled away steadily from the other speed stretch while being kept to task. CLICKBAIT
alternated up front closest to the inside, could not match the winner the final furlong, clearly best of the others. BLINKERS broke back, lacked any speed
while racing three wide into the turn, between foes entering the stretch, finished up best of the rest. SHOCKING FAST broke sharp, prompted the top two
from the three path for a half, had little left the final furlong. GOLD CREDIT turned in an even effort while racing four wide through the turn. MIZZ
FABULOUS a bit erratic in the early going, raced in the two path and went one paced throughout. JULIA'S READY broke back, trailed early, passed some
tiring rivals while never a threat. SHILAH BABY forwardly placed while four wide into the turn, faded. SUPER WONDER GIRL tired while saving ground.
BETWEEN THE HEDGES off a step slow, remained always back. PORTAL CREEK was finished early while racing four wide.
