Footnotes
CHANNELED'S ANGEL broke readily to gain a position tracking just outside the first flight in the opening quarter, continued with a steady, three wide
advance to bid for command nearing upper stretch, then edged forward through late stages under firm right handed pressure. MERENGUE, urged inside a
rival from the outset disputing the pace into the turn, resisted the winner's challenge in upper stretch but proved no match late. STRAND DE ORO broke
sharply, forced the pace outside a rival, then between foes into the turn and gave way after a half. BLAZING RUBY tracked off the first flight between foes in
opening stages and continued evenly between rivals into the lane. AUNT IRENE, restless in the gate, ducked out at the start brushing COMMISSION, was
settled last after the opening furlong, then improved position between rivals through the turn to the stretch while making no real impression. EARTHA was
prompted to a position tracking just off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. COMMISSION, off a step slowly, then
brushed at the start, switched out five wide early tracking the leaders into the turn but lacked a rally. OLGA AGAIN angled to the rail in early stages but
never gained contention. DELIGHTFULZEE'S angled inwards a bit to track the leaders four deep between foes but soon dropped out.

Footnotes
HUBBA BUBBA was guided to the rail in early stages tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance in the opening half, saved ground advancing in
tandem with several rivals nearing upper stretch, switched outside the pacesetter to challenge for command leaving midstretch and wrested a clear
advantage in time under firm handling. AMERICAN DRIVEN sped to the lead along the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin
racing to the far turn, dispatched a rival racing into upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner while holding well for the place honors.
OLD FORT was settled well off the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled four wide in upper stretch and gained some position in that path while
finishing on even terms with a rival for a share. MORO DRAMA tracked just off the second flight while angling inside early, saved ground to upper stretch
and continued with interest to finish on even terms with a rival for a share on the wire. STEALADEAL was settled last to the backstretch, saved ground to
upper stretch and made some belated progress. WOWZA MAN tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight to the far turn, shifted three deep nearing
the lane to lodge a brief bid but faded late. HEX, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, gave way into upper stretch. FULL
MOON RISING tracked off the second flight while angling inwards a bit, shifted out six wide racing through the stretch but lacked a rally. DRILL BIT tracked
the leaders three deep behind the second flight into the backstretch and never gained contention.

CLIFFY broke readily, stalked the leaders under light rating in the opening stages, advanced three wide entering the turn to challenge for command in upper
stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear under firm encouragement. BUFFALO MAX was settled outside foes dropping off the second flight in the
opening stages, then advanced four wide on the turn to upper stretch and proved best of the others. THREE OLIVEZ broke awkwardly while ducking
inwards, was settled into stride, then steadily improved position three wide between foes through the turn to the lane to prevail for a share. ESOR sped clear
outside foes in the opening furlong, angled inwards setting the pace a bit off the rail racing into the turn, couldn't fend off the winner's bid and gave way
leaving midstretch. MOZANO tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn and faded into the stretch. BEE BY THE SEA was settled off
the second flight along the inside racing into the turn, shifted about while caught in close quarters entering upper stretch and quickly came up empty.
BUMPA, forwardly placed near the inside in the opening stages, shifted out to lodge a brief bid between foes racing through the turn but emptied out racing
into the lane. INITFORTHELOVE was settled four wide between in early stages, then was fanned five wide into the lane but had no rally. BEYOND THE
STARS tracked off the second flight three wide between foes racing into the turn and steadily retreated. MIKE IS READY broke a step slowly and soon
dropped out. DUKE OF HEARTS was ordered scratched at the gate by the Stewards on the advice of the track veterinarian.

Footnotes
MARMALADE, off slowly when unprepared for the start, was guided inside a rival nearing the first turn, then was caught wide into that bend while dropping
off the second flight, was prompted to advance four wide through the backstretch to gain term with the first flight three deep entering the far turn, pressed
the issue in that path to gain a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, continued to dispute the issue outside a rival past midstretch then held the late
challenge of SAPPHIRE JUBILEE to the end under firm right handed encouragement. The latter was rated along the rail dropping off the second flight into
the backstretch, saved ground into the far turn steadily gaining position inside foes, shifted out three wide nearing midstretch while gathering late momentum
and just missed. SCARLET BOW, forwardly placed from the outset stalking a rival's pace into the backstretch, advanced on that foe nearing the far turn to
press the issue between rivals, dueled inside the winner past midstretch but weakened late. ELUSIVE RYDER settled off the second flight while switching
outside foes racing to the backstretch, was caught wide through the far turn, angled five wide entering the lane and continued with an effort to gain some
position. DARLINDIVA sprinted to the lead along the rail, set the pace on a clear margin to the far turn, briefly disputed the issue inside foes on the second
bend and emptied out into upper stretch. LUNA, caught five wide racing into the first turn, was prompted to make brief progress four wide through the
backstretch into the far turn but gave way into the lane. SHINY SURPRISE, firmly rated three deep between foes racing to the backstretch, steadily faded
into the stretch. MAMMA WHITE SOCKS, rank against restraint in the opening stages, angled to the inside entering the backstretch to track in second flight,
then faded into upper stretch. MAMBO DANCER, caught three, then four deep between foes leaving the chute, drifted out nearing the first turn into the path
of the eventual winner, was righted to track outside foes off the second flight but soon gave way.

Footnotes
GREELEY'S FAREWELL angled in sharply crossing the paths of several rivals to gain a position just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, continued
inside foes in second flight into the turn while awaiting an opening, split rivals when presented a clear path to challenge for command in upper stretch and
edged forward under some right handed pressure in late stages to prevail. GAME DAY DRAMA angled inwards prompting a rival's pace in the opening
quarter, pressed the issue between foes racing through the turn, resisted the winner's challenge past midstretch but proved only second best. PERP tracked
off the first flight outside foes in the opening quarter, advanced four wide on the turn to challenge the leaders in that path nearing upper stretch but couldn't
match the top pair late while edging rivals for a share. I'M A COOL MAN tracked off the first flight between rivals in the opening stages, advanced three wide
into the turn to challenge for command between foes nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. SENT FROM HEAVEN sped to the lead while
angling sharply to the inside setting the pace on a narrow margin in the opening furlong, dueled for command inside foes racing into the turn and gave way
into upper stretch. ONE FINE RIDE was steadied after being squeezed between rivals just after the start, settled into stride, then angled six wide entering
the lane but offered no rally. FIELDING GOLD was settled off the second flight racing to the turn and failed to menace. SUM OVERTURE, caught in close
quarters between rivals just after the break, tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing through the backstretch, angled out to race five wide between
foes in the closing stages but never menaced. WANNA SALSA hopped at the start while breaking slowly and failed to menace thereafter. RED ROSE CAT
tracked off the second flight inside foes racing to the turn but faded early.

Footnotes
SYZYGY broke readily to gain a narrow advantage along the rail leaving the chute, conceded the advantage to stalk a rival under light rating into the
backstretch came around a tiring foe racing into the far turn to advance on the pacesetter just off the inside racing into upper stretch, then wrested the
advantage and held several rivals on a safe margin to the end under firm right handed pressure. CALYPSO KEY was rated just off the second flight inside
foes to the backstretch, shifted out splitting rivals racing through the far turn, angled out four wide while making some contact with DAKOTA BEACH in
upper stretch but continued willingly in that path to close the gap on the winner to the end. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL, reserved in the last flight along the
inside to the backstretch, shifted splitting rivals just off the inside racing into upper stretch and was making steady progress between foes to the end.
MARCHENWALD, forwardly placed three deep stalking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, took over racing into the far turn, angled to the inside
nearing the lane once gaining a clear advantage but failed to sustain that momentum. FLORIDA RUST, reserved between foes in the last flight racing in
close quarters to the backstretch, switched outside foes on the far turn, was fanned seven wide into upper stretch and gained some position late while
making no real impression. KOA KANI, off last, was switched outside the field racing to the backstretch advancing to contention four wide after a half,
moved to lodge a brief, three wide bid entering the far turn but soon flattened out. DAKOTA BEACH, caught four deep in the opening stages, angled inwards
on the first turn to track off the leaders three deep between foes into the second bend, was carried out five wide into upper stretch while being bumped and
quickly came up empty. FOOT RUB LOVE tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, was caught four wide into the far turn, then fanned
six wide into the stretch and steadily faded. COSI MOMOSI, urged to the lead from between foes racing into the first turn, angled to the rail setting the pace
on the backstretch but emptied out early.

SKY MISCHIEF broke readily to gain a position tracking just off the first flight near the inside, split foes racing into the turn to challenge for command just off
the inside, then edged clear into the stretch under firm right handed encouragement. OCEANIC vied for command between foes through the backstretch,
pressed the issue three wide between foes through the turn to upper stretch but proved only second best. BATTLE RAGS, forwardly placed five wide in
early stages, advanced four wide on the turn to gain position but lacked the needed late kick. SENSE OF JUSTICE broke outwards exchanging contact with
DRAMA CHORUS, was righted to press the issue between foes into the turn and weakened nearing the lane. JUSTCUZIFEELLIKEIT ducked out at the
start, was righted to gain a position outside the first flight, was carried out by NOW I'M BROKE racing into the turn, was fanned six wide into the lane but
continued with interest to improve position. CAPTAIN BILLY ROY was settled inside foes in early stages and passed only tiring rivals. CARMICHAEL
tracked the leaders between foes from well out of striking distance and never gained contention. DRAMA CHORUS exchanged bumps at the start, angled to
the inside nearing the turn and steadily faded. FIVE STAR COLONEL vied for command inside foes racing into the turn and emptied out after a half.
POSITIVE IMPACT was off slowly and failed to menace. REAL GRACE, restless in the gate, bobbled at the start and never menaced thereafter.
CONVEYED, slow to gather stride, raced wide throughout. NOW I'M BROKE flashed brief pace four wide between foes, was taken up while going a bit
erratically into the turn shifting into the path of JUSTCUZIFEELlIKEIT and quickly dropped out.

ME AND MR. C angled inwards in the opening stages while racing under firm rating between foes to track off the second flight, switched out after a half
while being prompted to advance three deep racing into the far turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch gaining terms with the first flight and
continued with a steady late response to wrest a narrow advantage in time under firm handling. TABLED sped to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on
a narrow advantage to the second bend, dueled inside foes on the far turn past midstretch, then grudgingly contested the issue to the end to just miss. OUR
COUNTRY switched outside foes early tracking just off the second flight, advanced three deep nearing the far turn to press the issue in that path to
midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY, forwardly placed between foes attending the pace in the opening half, pressed the
issue between foes on the far turn to upper stretch and gave way late. PRETENDANT angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes under light
rating, then continued evenly into the stretch. BITCOIN PASSION (IRE) broke awkwardly while dropping out last, settled along the inside to the backstretch,
shifted out nearing the lane and gained some position while making no real impression. SPEAKERIT tracked off the second flight along the inside in the
opening half, angled outside foes racing into the stretch but offered no rally. VIOLATOR angled to the rail racing to the first turn tracking just off the first
flight, then faded into the stretch. KID DRAMA drifted well wide racing to the backstretch, continued four wide to the far turn making brief progress but soon
dropped out. TAPAGE, urged to gain a forward placing three deep tracking just off the leaders to the backstretch, was spent after a half.
