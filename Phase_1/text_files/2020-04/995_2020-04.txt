Footnotes
WILDCAT MERRY, unhurried in early stages racing outside foes behind the second flight, advanced four wide on the leaders leaving the midway point of
the turn, shifted inwards under pressure racing into the lane but took over and kicked clear under right handed encouragement. DRIVE IN was urged along
pursuing the pacesetter inside foes in the opening quarter, switched outside the leader on the turn while moving to terms with that rival, gained a brief
advantage racing into upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. DONNAMEUP angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of
the second flight, shifted out racing into upper stretch and made an effort to gain some position. HER ZEALOUS sprinted clear along the rail from the outset,
held sway on a clear margin into the the turn, but emptied out racing into upper stretch. BRYCENS GOLD, bumped soundly by TIDAL FIELD, then forced
out at the start, was caught wide throughout while proving no threat. MOR BREEZE tracked the leaders three deep as part of the second flight racing to the
bend, made brief progress between foes in that path on the turn but came up empty nearing upper stretch. LADY JORDAN tracked the leaders between
foes in second flight, lost some position when caught in close quarters leaving the midway point of the turn and soon gave way. TIDAL FIELD, fractious in
the gate, swerved out bumping a rival, was allowed to settled while being quickly outdistanced but walked off the course under her own power.

Footnotes
DON H broke readily to gain the advantage while angling inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the rail for six furlongs, shook clear nearing
upper stretch and held sway on a comfortable advantage under pressure. ESTILO PELIGROSO tracked just off the leaders outside a rival in the opening
half, shifted out three deep nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, couldn't gain terms with the winner but edged a rival for the place
honors late. LASTFORTINOFAMILY tracked just off the leaders along the inside under light rating to the backstretch, saved ground advancing through close
quarters racing into the lane but couldn't gain terms with the winner while being outkicked for second. IN HONOR OF ARTIE angled to the inside early while
being rated out of striking distance to the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch and gained some position three deep between foes in late stages.
GIMMEABREAK was settled last while angling to the rail, saved ground to upper stretch and made some mild progress. ROGUE RAGE, pulling a bit
between foes racing to the first turn, was held up to track off the second flight along the inside on the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing the lane and
quickly flattened out. FINALLY was settled between foes in the last flight to the backstretch, angled out nearing upper stretch but offered no rally.
HANDSOME GEM was settled outside rivals in the last flight early, angled five wide racing into upper stretch but proved no threat. FIFTH OF NOVEMBER,
urged to terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch to the far turn, gave way between rivals nearing the lane. EL SOLO UNO dropped out
early.

Footnotes
CANDY COVE, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening quarter, advanced to press that rival racing into the turn, edged
forward to a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch, shifted out slightly while being roused left handed to repel the challenge of SPECTACULAR ROAD
leaving midstretch exchanging some light contact with that foe near the sixteenth marker but held grudgingly to the end. The latter gained a forward placing
racing on terms with the eventual winner tracking just off the pacesetter into the turn, conceded some position on the turn, moved to challenge in the three
path in upper stretch, was bumped near the sixteenth marker while bidding for command and couldn't quite match the winner's kick. NEVER HAVE I EVER
(IRE), urged to the lead along the rail, set the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, dueled inside the eventual winner on the bend and gave way into the
lane. MY LITTLE ROCKSTAR angled inside early tracking off the second flight, saved ground to the lane and improved position inside foes late. TALE OF A
SONG tracked off the leaders racing a bit off the rail while inside foes to the turn but offered no rally. SO NIFTY was settled outside foes in early stages and
proved no threat. UNSPOILED MOMENTS dropped out of contention early. CALL ME HANDSOME shifted out three wide early while being prompted to
contend in second flight but steadily retreated entering the turn. HEBGONE made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide on the backstretch but emptied out
early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF SPECTULAR ROAD LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER WHILE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
MAGDALENA was rated inside rivals tracking behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch to bid for
command between foes in that path entering the lane, then gained a narrow advantage and held HONESTA to the end under firm left handed
encouragement. The latter was settled out of striking distance, switched outside foes racing into the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing into the
far turn, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch to challenge for command in tandem with the winner and contested the issue with that foe to the end
while just outkicked. RAY'S SILVER STORM switched out racing to the first turn tracking just off the pacesetter outside a rival in the opening half, readily
advanced between foes entering the far turn to wrest the advantage nearing upper stretch, held sway past the furlong marker but yielded to the top pair late.
POSEIDONS HEIR angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking just off the pacesetter, shifted out entering the lane but lacked the needed late kick.
INHONOROFOWENJR, reserved between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside on the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, shifted out
entering the lane but had no rally. BORN TO GROOVE tracked off the second flight racing three deep to the backstretch, advanced in that path to lodge a
brief bid nearing upper stretch but emptied out entering the lane. TALK NICE shifted inwards to track off the second flight between foes to the backstretch
but steadily faded after a half. LA WAPA sprinted to the lead while angling to the rail, set the pace into the backstretch, dueled briefly entering the far turn
and abruptly emptied out. CLEAN FUN trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PAPA RALPH J tracked off the first flight three wide between foes racing to the first turn, shifted out entering the backstretch, made a steady advance on the
leaders to challenge three deep racing into the far turn, then turned back a challenge from ONE MORE DRINK racing into the stretch to kick clear late under
firm handling. The latter tracked just off the first flight inside rivals into the backstretch, was eased back midway through the backstretch while switching
outside foes, was prompted to advance four wide on the far turn to loom briefly outside the winner, then drifted inwards under pressure entering the lane
while giving way. DISTINCTLY BREWED broke outwards bumping RICKY RUN, was collected to track off the second flight racing four wide to the
backstretch, then continued with an even effort three deep between foes on the far turn to the lane to gain some position while no real threat to the top pair.
MY COMPUTER tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, angled out five wide leaving the midway point of the far turn and gained some position
while making no real impression. WICKED WEDNESDAY tracked off the second flight near the inside and never seriously menaced. SHIFT THE BLAME
was settled between foes in early stages and proved no threat. ODESSA GOLD, bumped by RICKY RUN at the start, was urged to gain a contending
position between foes prompting the pace three deep into the turn, angled inwards nearing the far turn and quickly came up empty. OLD NEWS was urged
to the lead just off the inside racing into the backstretch to set the pace on a narrow margin and gave way inside foes racing into the far turn. SILENT
MISCHIEF, caught four wide racing into the first turn while making brief pursuit of the leaders, emptied out after a half. RICKY RUN, bumped, then forced
into a rival at the start, was shuffled back at the break and dropped out early.

Footnotes
AUTOGRAPH moved readily to the lead while angling inwards leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, then grudgingly
maintained the advantage to the end under firm handling. BROWN ESSENCE was prompted to gain a forward placing three deep between foes racing to
the first turn, shifted inwards a bit to track just off the pacesetter between foes under light rating, continued with a steady bid to challenge for command
between foes racing into upper stretch but couldn't gain even terms with the winner while narrowly prevailing for second. NEAT STREET was rated just off
the second flight along the inside, saved ground on the far turn gaining momentum, switched out three wide entering the lane and continued willingly to
close the gap on the top pair. READY TO MINGLE worked his way to the inside racing to the backstretch dropping well off the leaders, angled out five wide
racing into the lane and made an effort to improve position. SINATRA DEVIL tracked just off the pacesetter inside rivals to the far turn, was prompted inside
foes on the far turn and faded into the stretch. BATS CHANCE, caught four wide in the opening stages while prompted to a position in second flight,
continued three deep tracking just off the leader through the backstretch, lodged a brief bid in that path racing through the far turn and emptied out into the
lane. MORE THAN TEDDY, off slowly, then reserved last in early stages, was fanned six wide into the stretch and made no impact. DIG IN raced wide to
the backstretch and never seriously menaced. SKY D, held up in close quarters racing as part of the second flight to the first turn, was steadied out of tight
quarters entering that bend, tracked off the second flight between foes to the far turn and faded into the stretch. FAST FAIRY tracked off the second flight
outside foes in the opening half, raced four wide to the second bend and soon faded.

Footnotes
LOLANITA tracked the leaders four wide in second flight racing through the backstretch, commenced a steady, three wide advance on the turn to gain terms
with the pacesetter nearing upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and went clear under firm right handed pressure. MARDI GRAS GIRL tracked the
leaders three deep between foes in second flight, lost some position in traffic near the half mile marker, shifted out five wide racing into the stretch and
edged a rival for the place honors late. TORNERO, urged inside rivals disputing the pace, shifted out once losing the advantage after the opening quarter,
pressed the issue into the turn to gain a brief advantage but gave way leaving midstretch. TALE OF V K urged through close quarters to gain a position just
off the leaders, ducked outwards into the path of MARDI GRAS GIRL near the half mile marker, continued to track off the first flight between foes into the
bend and weakened in last stages. MY COTTON CANDY, off step slowly, was settled well off the field, shifted out five wide on the bend and improved her
position in late stages. RISEN CHANGE tracked the leaders four wide between foes off the second flight into the turn and continued evenly.
CASEYOUDIDN'TKNOW tracked off the second flight three wide between foes, angled in entering the stretch but proved no threat. R D HAVE FAITH, off
slowly, tracked the leaders along the inside but soon faded. LADY BREANNA tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening quarter but retreated
early. THE OTHER CAT was hustled to the lead while angling sharply to the inside and emptied out early. MS. GENUINE proved no factor.

MINNESOTA LUCKY pulled his way to the lead outside a rival in the opening stages, angled to the rail entering the first turn while crossing over the path of
GATE CREW, dictated the pace along the inside on a narrow margin to the second bend, held sway on a widening advantage into the lane and was kept to
firm encouragement. GATE CREW, urged to prompt the pace inside a rival in the opening stages while angling inwards, steadied along the rail when losing
his path entering the first turn while dropping off the second flight, tracked just off those rivals along the inside to the second bend, shifted out to split foes
three deep racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prove best of the others. IRISH EXPECTATIONS tracked off the second flight outside
foes, shifted out four wide advancing on the leaders nearing upper stretch but had no late kick. STUNNING BABY bobbled at the start, was righted, came
through close quarters to track just off the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing into the first turn, angled to the rail while continuing in that path
into the far turn but lacked the needed late bid. SOUL KITTEN tracked the leader between foes in second flight to the far turn and weakened into the stretch.
HOLD THE SPICE, held up along the rail racing to the first turn, was prompted to advance while switching out racing into the far turn, swung out five wide in
upper stretch but had no final kick. SOUL OF THE HERO, held up avoiding close quarters the break, was settled between foes, then forced wide avoiding
traffic racing into the first turn and proved no threat. LION CHARMER took up a position just off the leaders along the rail leaving the chute, was checked out
of tight quarters entering the first turn and never gained contention. GLOBAL DINNER, caught wide early, proved no factor. HIGH HEATER tracked the
pacesetter four wide into the first turn, continued three deep into the backstretch but retreated early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF GATE
