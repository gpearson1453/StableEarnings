Footnotes
BULLDAT settled in good position racing just off the early pace down the backstretch, launched a bid late on the far turn, was set down driving five wide in
the final furlong and drew clear late. LETSNOTGETOEXCITED was well placed stalking the pacesetter to the far turn, moved up three wide to challenge for
the lead near the quarter pole, vied with HONOLUA BAY into stretch run, dug in and shook free to a brief lead then got outkicked by the winner. HONOLUA
BAY was forwardly placed positioned just off the pacesetter, moved up to challenge for the lead at the quarter pole, battled back with
LETSNOTGETOEXCITED into stretch run, could not match strides in late stages but stayed on with response to hold a share. MISSANDEI settled three to
four wide through early stages then prompted four wide on the far turn, raced wide under a drive into upper stretch, switched in a couple paths and had a
mild improve. PRINCESA CRYSTAL (GB) was unhurried and saved ground, waited along the inside around the far turn then roused three to four wide in the
stretch run and responded evenly. UPSY DAISY DO raced near midpack, hustled up two wide between foes on the far turn then gave way in the lane.
NANIE'S TREASURE sped to the lead and set the pace along the rail to the far turn, vied for the lead inside a duo at the quarter pole then tired in the drive.
TAPIZAR GIRL bumped heading into the first turn, was unhurried down the backstretch, saved ground into the lane and could not muster a rally.
IMPRESSION GIVEN bumped with foe then raced four wide heading into the first turn, rated not too far back along the outside then urged to advance racing
three wide on the far turn, could not move on then dropped back.

Footnotes
BEYOND GONE vied for the early lead and battled on between foes into the turn, held a slim lead over AIN'T WASTING TIME at the quarter pole then
came under strong handling upper stretch, edged by stubborn AIN'T WASTING TIME near the furlong grounds then widened to a clear advantage and
stayed sharp. TRAVELIN GAMBLER tracked the embattled trio then launched a four wide bid on the turn, continued a steady effort through the lane and got
up late for place. AIN'T WASTING TIME vied along the inside for the lead in the opening quarter, continued to battle on with BEYOND GONE into the lane,
rival held the edge but kept on stubbornly near the furlong marker then appeared all out and gave way grudgingly for place. SARASOTA BOY raced widest
in the back then tucked in late backstretch to save some ground, moved back out and put to pressure racing wide into the lane and had a mild improve in
final stages. FLAMING HOT leaned in at the start then angled to the rail while not far back in the opening quarter, was ridden along but showed little around
the turn, saved ground into the lane then shifted out wider and failed to threaten. UYEDA chased the top trio in the early going then dropped back.
FRONTIER MESA vied for the lead in early stages then had nothing left past the quarter pole.

NOT NOW RAND raced in contention near the inside then switched out a couple paths and put to a drive nearing the quarter pole, kept on under strong
handling into the lane, took command near the eighth pole then drew sharp on top and finished going away. KING WADE raced between foes going by the
half mile marker then hustled along four to five wide upper stretch, continued a steady bid under pressure and gained place. GANGSTER OF LOVE
advanced from the widest position to race in contention three furlongs from home, flattened a bit under pressure moving through the turn then churned on
for a share. NEWYORK GIANT raced up close out of the gate, advanced three wide to hold a slim lead at the quarter pole, continued with a slight edge top
of the lane then got collared by the winner and gave way. CAPTAIN YENNER hustled up along the rail into stretch then chased on two wide in the lane,
gained position but needed more for serious impact. CAPTAIN DUKE held a slim lead under pressure, moved to the inside and continued to race in aim
upper stretch then had nothing left in late reserve. BULKCARRIER hustled up from the get-go but failed to gain a threatening position. BRIAN'S AVENUE
vied for the early lead and continued to chase in striking range to the quarter pole then weakened. NEXTSTOP POKIPC angled out and hustled up along
the outside entering the turn but could not produce the needed response for impact. CHADS CHOICE raced off the pace then wide into the lane and offered
no late bid. DRY LAND raced in the back throughout.

Footnotes
THRESHOLD settled nicely and tracked in close contention while saving ground, came under some mild prompting late on the far turn then tipped out three
wide entering top stretch, roused forward to reach STARSHIP BUBBA in late stages then edged by under firm handling. STARSHIP BUBBA set the pace
down the backstretch, vied briefly with SEE THE PYRAMIDS at the quarter pole then shook clear entering top stretch, stayed on gamely and dug in when
THRESHOLD began to loom a danger but had no closing kick left in reserve. SEE THE PYRAMIDS stalked down the backstretch then vied briefly with
STARSHIP BUBBA at the quarter pole, could not match with rival into the lane but ran on to secure a share. ABDAA was forwardly placed through early
stages, raced in a bit tight at the three eighths pole, responded evenly under pressure around the turn and had no real kick in the lane. STRONG ENDING
rated off the pace then moved into stretch wide under a drive and improved position without threatening. NINETYDAYSOFWINTER settled four wide
through early stages, put to pressure around the turn, raced two wide into the lane and could not muster a needed rally. PLAN OF ATTACK got in tight and
steadied in the first turn, raced off the early pace, showed response and gained closer contention around the far turn but could not sustain bid and gave
way. TEXAS GIANT was unhurried, raced two to three wide and failed to threaten. EXPRESS BOY steadied sharply on the first turn then tossed head
briefly before settling more, raced off the pace and failed to move on when called upon. VOICESINTHEDARKNEZ raced in range down the backstretch and
had no response when called upon in the far turn. NICK NICK lunged at the start and never moved into contention. INDIRECTLY settled along the inside
around the first turn, shied a stride which caused the rider to lose balance and fall then ran loose until corralled and walked off.

HIGH NOON RIDER was allowed to settle out of the gate and continued reserved two to three wide down the backstretch, moved to the inside position and
began to pick up the pace on the far turn, shifted out and put to pressure top stretch, responded sharply and finished going away. DALARNA saved ground
on the first turn then switched out a path and rated off the top two leaders, launched a bid and advanced three wide to take command past the quarter pole,
kept clear at the eighth pole then failed to be a match when the winner kicked by. MY POINT EXACTLY stalked the pacesetter to the far turn then vied for
the lead with ALIEN INVASION, could not match strides when DALARNA took control late on the far turn but never gave up and continued a steady effort to
clear the rest. MAJESTIC LUNA raced two to three wide off off the early pace, prompted three wide on the far turn but could not muster a needed rally.
ALIEN INVASION led the around the first turn, set the pace to the far turn, vied for the lead around the far turn then failed to move on when DALARNA took
control out of the turn and weakened. MR. CREATIVE rated along the inside then coaxed two wide on the far turn and failed to move into close contention.

CANDY MACHINE matched strides for the lead around the first turn with MUKULWITZ and continued to vie to the half mile marker, shook free racing in
hand and continued on top into the turn, was challenged for the lead when OR'EFFICE crept up along the rail near the quarter pole, bumped with tight
running rival then took back control and and kept clear under steady pressure. OR'EFFICE was forwardly placed around the first turn then raced under a
snug hold along the inside to rate off the top pair, edged up closer into the far turn then began to inch up along the rail to challenge CANDY MACHINE for
the lead near the quarter pole then ran out of room late on the turn, bumped with rival and steadied losing momentum, tipped out wider and kept on gamely
through the lane. ELLIS ISLAND tracked the pace and remained well placed in the second flight going by the half mile marker, launched a three wide bid
and raced in close range into the far turn then weakened off the top pair but remained clear for a share. MAU MAU was reserved in the back near the inside,
was put to a drive four wide on the far turn then raced wide into the lane and gained position without threatening. WIND RIDGE veered in and bumped at the
start, rated in range down the backstretch the asked three wide on the turn but failed to respond. PIANZI lost some footing and bumped at the start, raced
off the pace saving ground and had no response when called upon in the far turn. FRIED RICE KING settled three wide through early stages then two wide
on the turn and had no late response. MUKULWITZ vied for the lead with the winner to the half mile marker then retreated. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN

Footnotes
SINGSONG BIRD rated nicely four to five wide down the backstretch, launched a bid racing four deep near the three eighths pole, advanced to duel for the
lead at the quarter pole, battled on with CHEROKEE SOUND into stretch run, dug in gamely and got a nose up for victory. CHEROKEE SOUND tracked the
pace to the far turn, launched a three wide bid, vied for the lead out of the far turn then battled on with SINGSONG BIRD into stretch run, never gave up,
kept on gamely and got nipped for the win. TONED UP was unhurried through early stages and continued near the rear on the far turn, showed response
three wide upper stretch, gained then shifted to the rail in late stages and stayed on with good response. VEER settled and saved ground through early
stages, launched a two wide bid on the far turn, continued in range under strong handling at the eighth pole then lacked a closing bid. POSITIVE POWER
raced five wide off the early pace, ranged up four deep to race in range near the quarter pole, chased on to mid-stretch then flattened out. LASKA was
unhurried and saved ground, angled out and began to launch a outside bid entering the lane, got going then was forced to steady sharply nearing the
furlong marker and lost all momentum. MARICOPA raced off the pace, saved ground around the far turn, shifted out entering top stretch and lacked a
needed rally. MATCHA stalked the early pacesetter, vied for the lead around the far turn then tired in the drive. AMBER PRINCESS got bumped at the start
then steadied repeatedly on the the first turn, chased three wide around the far turn then faded. EMILIA STRONG set the uncontested pace to the far turn
then came up empty near the quarter pole. MALAGA raced wide and was easing up in the lane.
