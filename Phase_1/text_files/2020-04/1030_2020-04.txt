LOVE TO LEARN pressed the pace, gained command nearing the far turn and drew off in the latter stages under strong handling. QUIET SPRING vied for
the early lead from the inside and was no match for the winner. KIANA'S LOVE was allowed to settle early, raced three wide at the eighth pole and not
enough late. LILA'S LUCKY LADY stalked the early pace, raced two deep and had no response. BROKE FINANCING was hustled from the inside and tired.
BERYL'S FLIGHT dropped back early and failed to have a response.

OWEN THE GREAT tracked the early leader while saving ground, dug in late and finished gamely under all out pressure. PROUD MOMENTS was allowed
to settle early, moved up four wide at the quarter pole and finished gamely under strong encouragement. ASSAY stalked the pace, moved up along the
inside through the stretch and had not enough late. NATIVE RIVER showed good early speed and faltered in the drive. HEY RALPHIE BOY settled off the
early pace, raced towards the inside and had no response. GOSPEL CALIBER was slow to begin, raced three deep and never threatened. A LA OMEGA
bobbled at the break, raced four deep into the upper stretch and never was a factor. HI HEAT BOY failed to sustain a bid.

raced four deep at the quarter pole and had no late response. KISS MY NOTE settled off the early pace and failed to respond. LIKE A COWBOY raced

SIDEPOCKET BET stalked the early pace, moved up four wide into the lane, drifted late and prevailed under all out pressure. BARONET stalked the early
pace, moved up five wide at the quarter pole and finished second best. PADDY O was off slowly, moved up three wide through the lane and showed good
late interest. UNDIVIDED was off slowly, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had not enough. HONEST N LUCKY was allowed to settle early, raced three
wide in the lane and had no late rally. INDIAN GEM stalked the pace and weakened along the inside through the stretch. WHEW was away slowly, raced far
back early and never was a factor. TOSKIKO dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. PERFECTLY PRECIOUS
pressed the pace and gave way. SYRAH showed good speed from the inside and tired readily.

KRIS ME DEADLY showed good early speed along the inside and prevailed under all out pressure. DARING EGO stalked the early pace, moved up four
wide through the stretch and finished gamely to just miss. OKLAHOMA LINE was allowed to settle early, moved up five wide at the eighth pole and closed in
gamely in the latter stages. BIZ OPS stalked the early pace, raced three wide in the lane and weakened a bit late. IKON WHO settled off the early pace,
saved ground and never was a factor. JERRY'S VISION failed to have a response. XAVTRIX dropped back early and failed to menace.

willingly to the wire. FAYETTE WARRIOR settled off the early pace, raced two wide while racing between rivals in the stretch and had not enough late.

Footnotes
SERIOUS TALK stalked the pace, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and prevailed under all out pressure. CYCLONE DAN was allowed to settle early,
raced along the inside in the lane, angled out five wide nearing the sixteenth pole and closed gamely to just miss. IRISH CAPITAL showed good early
speed, two wide in the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. PATRIOT stalked the pace, raced along the inside around the far turn through the lane and
kept on to the wire. JROCK pressed the pace, raced three deep and weakened a bit late while racing between rivals. WESTMONT stalked the pace, moved
up three wide in the stretch, took up sharply at the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. HOLIDAY MAN settled off the early pace, raced four deep and had
no final winning bid. FAFA saved ground and never was a factor. HOT'N NOTTY raced six wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. INDY PIRATE
failed to have a response. CAYDEES HERO raced four wide at the quarter pole and never threatened. KIPPER KEY was off slowly and never menaced.
