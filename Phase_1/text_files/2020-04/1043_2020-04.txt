Footnotes
CLEAN LIVING sped to the front, set the pace three wide to the turn, moved inside and a bit off the rail into the stretch, came under in upper stretch, led
clear under left-handed and found the wire just in time. TAPITHA BONITA settled off the pace, advanced four wide through the turn, closed from the outside
but missed at the wire. AIMING STRAIGHT chased outside a rival, two to three wide around the turn, lacked the needed late punch to pose a threat to the
top pair but stayed on for the show. MAZ KANATA stalked the pacesetter from the two path, moved in a path on the turn and saved ground to the stretch,
roused in the final furlong but could not find more. SLIGHTLY tracked off the rail, went three wide into the turn, angled five wide leaving the bend and failed
to respond when asked. SIX EIGHTEEN mid-pack in the early stages, angled in and raced a bit off the rail around the turn and never rallied. CUTE TALKER
lacked early speed and raced wide up the backstretch, went four wide around the turn and also lacked a rally. MILLIE JOEL angled in on the backstretch,
took the turn two wide and never threatened. SARAZONA TWO outside a rival in the early going, came three wide into the stretch and had little left offer.

Footnotes
SHARPEST ONE pressed from the outside, took over midway around the turn, cleared inside rival then lugged out into the stretch, challenged in the late
stages and held the runner-up at bay. MAIKA stalked outside a rival, went two to three wide around the turn, angled out past the eighth pole, closed inside
the leader but lacked the final kick to get by. NIGHT OF IDIOTS lacked early speed, angled in some on the backstretch, tucked inside on the turn and saved
ground, rallied along the fence but was not enough to impact the top pair. SUGARATSUNDOWN set the pace under pressure from both sides then fought
with SHARPEST ONE to the turn, lost command around the bend and chased the leader a bit off the rail into the stretch and weakened. LOVELY STORM
traveled four deep into the turn, four wide and between rivals around the bend and lacked a response when needed. BLAZING MISS forwardly placed from
the inside, dropped back on the turn, looked to advance in the drive but checked off the heels of SUGARTATSUNDOWN, shifted out around that rival but
had lost late momentum. BABA BE GONE outside a rival up the backstretch, entered the turn five deep, traveled five wide and four deep into the lane and
could not rally. PRINCESS RUN IT three deep into the turn, three wide and between rivals through the bend and offered no response.

Footnotes
MO DINERO stalked outside of CANNES in the early stages, bid three deep around the turn, gained command but lugged out nearing the stretch, corrected
course and battled three deep down the lane and proved best late. HOT N'FAMOUS dueled from the outside, vied between foes around the turn and down
the stretch, fought gamely but yielded to the winner. HACK dueled from the inside, vied near the fence around the turn, battled back in the drive and got
outkicked by the top pair. CANNES chased the pacesetters up the backstretch, raced three wide then two wide into the lane and finished evenly in the final
furlong. OVER EZ settled off the pace, traveled two wide on the turn then three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. CHOCOLATE MESS tossed head
shortly after the start and dropped to the back of the field, saved ground around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and was never a factor. LIL'
CHIEFTAIN raced along the inside, saved ground into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
PIE O MY hustled to the front, set the pace with SHARED to the outside, cleared rival on the turn and drew away under strong urging. SHARED pressed
from the outside, lost contact with the winner on the turn, chased through the lane and held the place. RIGGSKI tracked the top pair, came three wide and
finished willingly to whittle the gap. SOUND CHECKERS bumped at the start, raced outside a rival, two wide on the turn and lacked a bid. DECOSTER
broke well from the far outside, stalked outside a rival, four wide into the stretch, asked but came up empty in the lane. CHERRY PIE bumped leaving the
gate, took the turn two wide and never rallied. KENZLEE'S GOV saved ground around the turn, came out at the top of the stretch and proved no menace.
HERE I GO INDY stumbled leaving the gate, raced near the back of the field, two wide through the turn, angled inward in the stretch and had little left.
