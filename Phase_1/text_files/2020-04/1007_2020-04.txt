Footnotes
LITTLE NATALIA broke readily to assume a narrow advantage while shifting off the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin on her own courage racing
into the turn, came under some mild urging to kick clear racing through the stretch and was taken in hand nearing the wire. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW,
urged between rivals to gain terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival into the turn, proved no match for that foe nearing the lane but continued with a
grudging effort to preserve the place honors. EXPLOSIVE PACKAGE angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing through the backstretch and
steadily faded between foes into the lane while edging a rival for a share. MI TIA REGIS was settled last along the rail in the opening stages, saved ground
to upper stretch but had no rally. TRAP GIRL tracked the pacesetter three deep between foes into the turn and faded nearing the lane.
THIRSTYFORAMIRACLE was settled outside foes dropping off the second flight and failed to menace. SHE'S A FAIR CATCH, urged to gain a forward
placing four wide racing to the turn, gave way nearing the lane. JEANIE VEE dropped out early.

Footnotes
MY ECLAIR moved readily to the lead racing four wide in the opening furlong, angled inwards setting the pace into the turn, then held sway on a widening
advantage to the end under firm right handed encouragement. CHARLIECANDO urged to a forward placing three deep between foes, shifted inwards while
conceding some position nearing the turn to track between rivals, shifted out three deep racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late effort to
prove best of the others. ARBA, urged to a forward placing along the inside, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter into the turn and weakened racing into the
stretch. K'S FUNHOUSE, a bit reluctant to load, broke inwards brushing REACHNFORASIXPACK, was held up off the leaders between foes in the opening
stages, switched outside rivals racing into the turn while being urged in pursuit of the pacesetter between foes and gave way into the lane. THE
CONNECTOR raced unhurried tracking just off the second flight along the rail, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with an even effort inside foes.
NOBODYKNOWSNOTHIN was settled outside foes in the opening stages, was prompted to gain contention while being fanned four wide leaving the
midway point of the turn and offered no rally. BELUSHI SAMURAI dislodged his rider to run loose momentarily before the start, was then fractious loading,
broke awkwardly losing position to the field and failed to menace thereafter. REACHNFORASIXPACK, extremely fractious while proving difficult to load in
the starting gate, was brushed at the start while flashing brief pace between foes, was held up out of close quarters nearing the turn and quickly dropped
out.

Footnotes
LADY LOVE, off a step slowly, was settled last to the backstretch near the inside, steadily gained contention racing into the far turn, briefly awaited an
opening nearing upper stretch, shifted out splitting rivals three deep entering the lane and produced a solid closing response to reel in BLAZING BROOKE
to wrest a clear advantage in time under firm left handed encouragement. The latter, caught five wide racing into the first turn, angled inwards while being
rated just off the leaders racing into the backstretch, came through close quarters racing into the far turn to advance three deep challenging for command,
went clear into the stretch but couldn't contain the winner's late surge. BLUE CHICORY broke sharply, was urged inside foes disputing the pace into the
backstretch, lost some position inside foes nearing the lane but shifted out in the closing stages making a second effort to edge a rival for a share.
SPEEDING STARLET broke inwards brushing MAMMA WHITE SOCKS, was rated off the first flight a bit off the inside to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance while shifting out four wide in upper stretch but had no closing response. PLEASANT BUFFY, urged between foes pressing the pace from the
outset into the backstretch, edged forward to a narrow advantage racing through the far turn but gave out abruptly in upper stretch. SHINY SURPRISE,
urged to gain terms with the first flight four wide between foes racing to the first turn, prompted the issue for a half and gave way racing into the far turn.
MAMMA WHITE SOCKS came through tight quarters start, then was urged three deep between rivals prompting the pace to the backstretch but came up
empty entering the far turn. CASPIAN TALE, off a step slowly while shuffled a bit avoiding tight quarters at the start, never gained contention.

Footnotes
MILBURN was guided to the rail leaving the chute to track just behind the second flight under reserve to the backstretch, switched outside a tiring rival
nearing the far turn to gain some position inside foes entering the second bend, switched out racing into upper stretch to split foes three deep leaving the
furlong marker and produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time while being taken in hand nearing the wire. AMERICAN DRIVEN,
forwardly placed three deep racing in touch with the first flight in the opening half, was urged to bid between foes in that path racing into the far turn, edged
forward to a narrow advantage midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner. O DANNY BOY, caught five wide racing into the first turn while tracking just off
the second flight, made steady progress four deep between foes on the backstretch to gain terms with the leaders entering the far turn, continued in that
path to upper stretch but finished evenly in the closing stages while prevailing for a share. ANALYZEYOURVISION, in touch with the leader attending the
pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes, then along the inside racing into the far turn but weakened leaving midstretch. OLD FORT
tracked the leaders four wide, then three deep between foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled out five wide nearing upper stretch
and continued evenly. WOWZA MAN, urged to dictate the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes
racing to the far turn and gave way after six furlongs. RIONERO tracked the leaders three deep between foes as part of the second flight to the backstretch,
shifted out racing into the lane but had no rally. MORO DRAMA was settled last racing to the first turn, switched out nearing the backstretch, was caught five
wide while being prompted to advance racing into the far turn but proved no real threat. WYATTS WARRIOR tracked just off the first flight along the inside
to the backstretch but faded after a half. OVERPRAISE tracked just off the first flight between foes racing to the far turn and emptied out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
FEDERALE broke readily to attend a rival's pace under light rating racing to the turn, pressed the issue midway through the bend to gain a narrow
advantage, then was roused right handed to go clear through the stretch and was taken in hand approaching the wire. BURL stalked just off the first flight
under light rating racing a bit off the inside to the turn, was urged to challenge for command three deep between foes nearing upper stretch but proved no
match while prevailing for the place honors. IMPRESSIVE SPEED, bumped at the start, recovered to track off the second flight between foes racing to the
turn, split foes just off the inside to advance inside the top pair but lacked the needed late kick. LARGE tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the
second flight racing to the turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and weakened late. GOLDEN V C came through close quarters along the inside to
dispute the pace racing into the turn, pressed the winner through the bend and gave way into upper stretch. PUERTO VARAS tracked off the second flight
outside foes racing to the turn but never gained contention. ADIOS SEE YA dislodged his rider to run loose momentarily before the start, angled to the
inside early tracking off the second flight but soon dropped out. ROBERTOS TICKET broke awkwardly, then swerved out sharply to race wide through the
backstretch and never menaced thereafter. BAHAMIAN STAR broke inwards bumping GOLDEN VC, then ducked out making contact with IMPRESSIVE
SPEED at the start and quickly dropped out.

in that path while shifting inwards bumping that foe in upper stretch but continued with a steady late response to kick clear under firm encouragement.
ARGENTINIAN ROOTS (IRE), reserved off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, switched out racing into the far turn advancing just inside in
tandem with several rivals, shifted out four wide in upper stretch, then came through tight quarters in the closing stages to edge a rival for the place honors.

foes to the second bend, was prompted to advance in tandem with several rivals while being fanned five wide into upper stretch, leaned inwards making
contact with ARGENTINIAN ROOTS (ARG) in the final stages and was just outkicked for second. ROSALDA, pulling against restraint between foes in
second flight racing to the first turn, switched out three deep racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue outside the pacesetter racing into the far turn,
gained a brief advantage between calls racing into upper stretch, was bumped entering the lane but contested second to late stages while being just
outkicked for a share. MIA ANGELINA angled inwards to attend a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, briefly contested the issue between foes after a half
but emptied out early. SUDDEN LIGHT tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, continued three deep between foes into the far turn
making brief progress but had no closing response. SWEET LEAF tracked just off the leaders inside rivals in second flight to the backstretch and came up
empty racing into the far turn. RACHIELY'S DREAM sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin for a half, dueled for command
into the far turn and gave out racing into the stretch. QUEENS WORLD, bumped at the start, was settled outside foes early and failed to menace.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF ROSALDA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH
WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
I'LL MAKE U FAMOUS broke readily to prompt the pace outside a rival racing in the three path through the backstretch into the turn, took over nearing
midstretch and went clear under some right handed pressure. RELISHMENT tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the turn, angled
inside the leaders entering the stretch and edged a rival for the place honors in late stages. FOG WARNING was urged to dispute the pace racing a bit off
the rail through the backstretch into the turn but gave way midstretch when failing to match the winner. BEYOND STREETSMART settled off the second
flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane and gained some position in an even effort. DEVIL'S RULE tracked off the second flight under light reserve
in the opening quarter, shifted out five wide entering the turn while being prompted to advance, loomed four deep nearing upper stretch, but shifted inwards
entering the lane and soon flattened out. ABSALOM tracked the pace outside foes in second flight, continued three deep between foes into the turn and
gave way into the lane. ROCK THE PARK tracked the leaders racing four wide in second flight to the turn and steadily faded nearing the stretch. DONNIE
BRASCO broke slowly, then was held up last in the opening stages and never seriously menaced. GOOD SOLUTION tracked the leaders inside rivals as
part of the second flight racing to the turn but steadily retreated into the stretch.

Footnotes
STRONG GEM was rated just off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, was steadied slightly in close quarters leaving the midway
point of the far turn while coming around a tiring foe to bid inside rivals nearing upper stretch, came through when gaining a clear path entering the lane and
quickly moved clear under firm encouragement. AND I KNOW was settled between foes racing to the first turn, switched outside foes while being prompted
to advance nearing the far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to prove best of the others. JACKIES DREAM, reserved off the
second flight along the inside in the opening half, continued under patient handling on the far turn, shifted out entering the stretch, then split rivals just off the
inside advancing in close quarters in late stages to narrowly prevail for a share on the wire. MY LITTLE ROSY tracked just off the pacesetter between foes
as part of the second flight in the opening half, was urged to lodge a brief bid racing into the stretch but weakened between foes late. BROKEN ENGLISH
tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight racing to the far turn, was urged to challenge for command in that path nearing upper stretch but soon
flattened out. RED KITTEN tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the far turn, was fanned six wide into the lane but offered no rally. SMARTY
CAT, urged to the lead while angling to the rail leaving the chute, set the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled inside foes into upper stretch and
gave way once losing the advantage to the winner. LASTING JOY settled last to the backstretch, switched out on the far turn, was fanned seven wide into
the lane but proved no real threat. SYZYGY tracked just off the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight, then steadily faded nearing upper
stretch. STRICT VOW, reserved near the inside racing to the backstretch, offered no rally.
