Footnotes
STRONG ENDING tucked in saving ground just off the leaders, briefly lacked room under a hold into the far turn, secured maneuvering room and was
guided out to the three-path turning for home, responded to pressure and wore down CARDIAC KID from outside. CARDIAC KID contested the pace
outside LIMETINI, gained the upper hand a furlong out, led through deep stretch but could not hold off the top one. LIMETINI argued the pace inside from
the outset, and weakened into the final furlong. PERCHER raced three wide early, and failed to menace with an even finish. TIGER'S BACK swung four
wide off the final turn, and posed no threat. ABDAA became rank along the rail and steadied through most of the first quarter-mile, and was empty when
roused. GATTO MARRONE was in tight and took an awkward stride or two between STRONG ENDING and RAPSTOREROCKS approaching the far turn,
and was finished after six furlongs. SPLENDID STONE took several erratic strides and was steadied just after the start, and was outrun inside.
RAPSTOREROCKS brushed the left side of the gate coming out, prompted the pace three wide and faltered after six furlongs. THIS IS SPARTA ducked out
slightly at the break with the rider briefly losing the right iron, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SUNSHINE CITY swung four wide from well back coming off the turn, rallied under heavy pressure and got up despite drifting out. SPECIAL INCLUSION
raced three wide around the turn, kept on willingly and was up outside MISSING LINK to snag second near the wire. MISSING LINK sped to the front soon
after the start, was clear inside to deep stretch but weakened in the final yards. DARLA broke in at the start, was outsprinted to the stretch three wide, and
was going well belatedly. INERTIA chased outside MISSING LINK to the stretch, and lacked the needed response. TEMPT ME checked due to outside
pressure at the start, had the rider drop the whip late on the turn, and had no rally urged with goggles. LA MAMA CHULA was crowded by DARLA at the
start, and outrun four wide. KITTEN'S DREAM showed little.

CLOUDBASED settled in the middle of the field early, bid between horses in the three-path through the stretch and prevailed late. BEACH TRAFFIC raced
five wide early, took over three wide around the far turn, veered out late under heavy pressure and was edged to the wire. WINNING FACTOR was
forwardly placed early, was put to heavy pressure on the far turn three wide, had aim outside into the stretch, and was bothered and carried out by BEACH
TRAFFIC while weakening in the late stages. PERFECT ENOUGH vied outside KATZ ME AT NOON up the backstretch and into the far turn, and tired in
the stretch. FAYEZ failed to menace through a four-wide journey. LOVEDISC bobbled after the start, raced four wide early and did not factor. KATZ ME AT
NOON tugged his way up to vie inside PERFECT ENOUGH through the middle fractions, and was finished after six furlongs. SOBEK was five wide early,
dropped far back after six furlongs, was pulled up into the stretch and walked off. AN OBECTION BY THE RIDER OF WINNING FACTOR AGAINST
BEACH TRAFFIC ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
MYSTIC NILE saved ground unhurried into the turn, followed behind PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL advancing past the quarter-pole, tipped to the two-path into the
stretch, and prevailed outside PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL after a long drive. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL slipped through along the rail to take over from SHES ONE
MAD MOMMA approaching the stretch, dug in when challenged by MYSTIC NILE through the lane and came up second best. JANET B DOESIT ALL
lunged at the start and was far back for a half-mile, advanced outside into the stretch and finished well. BIMINI was forwardly placed early, shifted five wide
approaching the stretch and lacked a solid bid. MY SEBASTIANA lodged a bid four wide late on the turn, and tired in the stretch. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA
set the pace in the two-path, came under attack from both flanks on the turn, and faded steadily after a half-mile. MIZ CHAPLIN challenged for command
between horses three wide on the turn, but could not sustain the bid and gave way. CHARGE ACCOUNT could not keep pace around the turn, and was
eased up in the late stages.

Footnotes
INDICIA was outrun early, came five wide beginning to find her best stride turning for home, reached the front in deep stretch outside rivals and won going
away. LET'S BE HONEST pressed the early pace outside, took over four then three wide between calls on the turn, battled outside BRAMBLE BAY into the
lane, and ran on to best that one for the place. BRAMBLE BAY was never far back, slipped through on the rail to poke a head in front of LET'S BE HONEST
after six furlongs, dueled into the stretch and weakened on the wrong lead. OMNIA gave chase three wide early, and weakened before completing six
furlongs. I AM MAGICAL (GB) raced widest early, and was never a factor. MIXTECA set the early pace removed from the rail, and gave way around the
turn. SHIKAKA was finished early inside.

Footnotes
GHOST GAME was slowest to begin, bumped with TEMPUS and steadied early, raced well back inside for nearly a half-mile, angled to the far outside for
the drive, overhauled CHILL HAZE with 70 yards remaining and won going away. CHILL HAZE tracked from close range early, took over three wide outside
DREAM D'ORO in upper stretch, edged clear with a sixteenth remaining but shortened stride on the wrong lead and could not hold off the winner. FAST
MAGIC raced widest early, moved in around the turn, cut the corner still well back at the top of the lane, moved off the rail past the sixteenth-pole and was
going well at the finish. SPEEDY HANS bumped hard with BOURBON STREET at the start, advanced three then four wide around the turn, but could not
sustain the rally. DREAM D'ORO contested the early pace outside LEGAL DEAL, relinquished the lead to CHILL HAZE into the stretch, and weakened.
ALFATEI raced toward the inside in midpack to the stretch, and lacked a final rally. TAPI FROST was hard to load, angled in after the start tightening up
rivals, raced four wide around the turn and tired. LEGAL DEAL contested the pace inside DREAM D'ORO for a half-mile, and gave way. TEMPUS bumped
with GHOST GAME and checked out of tight quarters early, and never reached contention. BOURBON STREET bumped solidly with SPEEDY HANS at the
start, and retired early.

SKY CHASER advanced mildly under a drive four wide on the turn, kept on task through the lane and wore down RUN DEVIL from outside. RUN DEVIL
bumped with OUR CLOSURE at the start, set the pace slightly removed from the rail, dug in through the stretch and yielded grudgingly. REAL DOOZIE
saved ground behind the leaders to the stretch, and could not threaten with an even finish. HEIRESSINDY bumped with OUR CLOSURE at the start,
pressed the pace outside RUN DEVIL to the stretch, and weakened. OUR CLOSURE was bumped lightly between horses at the start, raced forwardly early,
and faded before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
BELLA CIAO was unhurried early, shifted out four or five wide finding a seam between rivals at the top of the stretch, caught the leaders from outside a
sixteenth out and pulled clear. FLAT AWESOME JENNY tracked just off the leaders in the four-path entering the turn, challenged for command and reached
the front briefly after straightening away for the drive, and ran on stubbornly between horses. MIDNIGHT SOIREE advanced inside around the turn, loomed
along the fence vying for command in upper stretch, but flattened out in the last furlong. CUDDLE KITTEN stayed in range four to five wide to the top of the
stretch, and faded through the late stages. FINAL CUT pressed the pace outside for nearly six furlongs, and gave way. CROWN AND SUGAR set a
pressured pace slightly removed from the rail, and gave way after six furlongs. SEAN'S IDEA went wrong in the right hind just after the start and was quickly
pulled up, and was vanned off.

BYE BYE MAN moved inward midway on the far turn, shifted back out four wide approaching the stretch, and wore down BACANO in the closing yards.
BACANO pressed the early pace outside RUSSIAN WINE, took over and pulled clear around the far turn, remained in command to deep stretch but could
not hold on. CREATIVE GENIUS raced mostly four wide around the turns, advanced getting closest to the leader a quarter-mile out, but flattened out in the
stretch. RED FOG raced three wide in range to the far turn, and had no final bid. BODIE CODY raced forwardly early between rivals, had the rider lose the
whip past the five-sixteenths pole, and faded steadily. RUSSIAN WINE set the early pace inside, and faltered after being overtaken by BACANO into the far
turn. PREACHER MARSEE raced three wide, and faded before reaching the stretch. STUCK WITH YOU trailed from the start, and was eased up in the
stretch.
