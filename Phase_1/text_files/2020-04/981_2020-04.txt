Footnotes
MR. BIG SHOT contested the early lead outside J TRAIN to move clear heading up the backstretch then widened the remainder under steady handling. J
TRAIN contested the early lead inside the winner, could not go with that one but held position through the lane. TRIP CODE hesitated at the break to get
away last and dropped well off the pace while saving ground, moved up but could not get to the top pair. LEON'S DIAMOND lunged at the break, followed
the pace three wide and weakened. MR MON tracked the leaders three or four wide for a half and tired. PRINCE B saved ground in reach of the early pace
and tired. LET'S HOPE was always back.

the margin under steady handling. RED MAJESTY chased the early leaders three or four wide, angled five wide into the lane and gained the place late.
YOUNGBOY saved ground through the turn then narrowly missed the place late. UN NAMEABLE STREET chased the winner three wide then could not
hold position in the drive. MORE THAN STATURE was angled out through the turn to fan six wide into the lane and could not threaten. DREAMING TYPE
chased the winner from four wide and weakened. SADDLE IN COMMANDO fanned seven wide into the lane and was always back. MAC'S DRAGON trailed

EBONY NIGHTS saved ground back off the early pace, moved closer through the far turn to angle outside the leader upper stretch and went clear under
steady handling. SCOTIA QUEEN showed the most early speed to cross over and gain the inside going to the first turn, made the running to upper stretch
and could not handle the winner while holding position late. GABY VEE was angled out heading up the backstretch to follow the pace four wide, remained in
reach but lacked a solid closing response. WITTS DATA LINK chased the leader from three wide to upper stretch and weakened. ALICIA'SVALENTINE
followed the pace four wide and had no rally. LAINE'S PEACH was last away and improved position three wide while not a threat. SOUTH CAROLINA was
always back. D WITCHES OF O TWO followed the pace three wide and tired. RIVER WILD saved ground and tired.

Footnotes
SPA SHACKALACKA was on the pace out from the rail while pressed by LANGS LEGEND, dug in through the lane and kept that one at bgay to the wire.
LANGS LEGEND forced the pace outside the winner throughout and went gamely to the wire but could not get by. DION tracked the top pair three wide and
continued evenly in the lane to hold position. FREE MUSIC was in reach of the leaders three or four wide but could not produce the needed closing run.
BRONCO DAVE was along the inside and lacked a final closing kick. PROUD ITALIAN lacked a rally four and five wide. IN CONTROL failed to mount a bid
while four and five wide. DOUBLEC'STWOPUNCH was not a threat three wide. SPUR was always back. WELL MANNERED was not a factor.

Footnotes
DRIBBLES dueled on the pace outside RULETHENIGHT through the opening half mile, dug in as SHEPHERD'S PRIDE challenged into the lane and kept
that one safe through the drive. SHEPHERD'S PRIDE saved ground in behind the leaders to the far turn, angled four wide to challenge into the lane, drifted
in through midstretch and could not run down the winner. RULETHENIGHT dueled on the pace inside the winner to the far turn, continued into the lane but
came up empty late. LONESOME HIGHWAY followed the pace three wide and could only mildly close the gap the late. COWBOY DON was four and five
wide and lacked a solid closing rally. HOT BLOODED SONG saved ground and failed to mount a rally. RUSSELL CAVE was not a threat racing three wide.
COUNTRY CLUB DINER was not a factor.

MISS ELLIE'S GIRL saved ground back off the early pace, rallied through the far turn to bid turning for home, moved clear then held safe late while drifting
through deep stretch. LINGERING SALLY saved ground near the back through the first turn, continued two or three wide to the far turn, angled six wide
nearing the lane and closed late but could not get to the winner. ANWARA stalked the pace in good position three or four wide but lacked a final closing bid.
TRUE ALLEGIANCE dueled on the pace outside DIXIE DELTA through the opening half mile, continued while challenged by the winner into the lane and
came up empty. STALKER stalked the pace from three wide and lacked a final closing bid. DIXIE DELTA dueled on the pace inside TRUE ALLEGIANCE to
late in the far turn and weakened. ATOKA GIRL lacked any early speed, moved up four and five wide while not a threat. REEL RED DOMINATOR was

Footnotes
GREEN CARD settled in reach of the pace racing four wide, rallied through the far turn to bid into the lane then continued on well to wear down TRASK and
be edging clear late. TRASK gained a short lead inside rivals to make the pace to the far turn, resisted as the winner challenged into the lane but could not
handle that one late. DORCHEAT ZARB tucked inside behind the early leaders through the first turn, rallied through the far turn to bid into the lane but could
not sustain the move in the drive. DIESEL'S PRIZE was caught four wide between rivals into the first turn, continued in reach to the far turn but weakened
nearing the lane. CRIMSON JET was caught five and six wide through the first turn while showing some speed, continued to press from outside TRASK to
the far turn and weakened. FAT TIRE was shuffled back between rivals at the break, moved up three to five wide but could not threaten late. MAGIC
COWBOY saved ground early, angled four wide in the far turn but was no threat. HIDDEN GUN followed the pace three wide and weakened. TRISTAN'S
DREAM showed early foot three or four wide between rivals and weakened. CHARED was last away and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GLOBAL EXCHANGE showed the most early speed to cross over to the inside going to the first turn, made all the running on her own pace to draw off in
the far turn and held the margin under steady handling. PRETTY RICH saved ground just off the early pace, moved nearest the winner into the lane but
could not close the gap. CHICKES DONE bumped with rivals at the start, moved up four wide into the lane but could not threaten late. VIOLENT FIT chased
the winner's pace from three wide and weakened. ONEPRETTYTHING saved ground and lacked a rally. LIVE LARGE bumped with rivals at the start and
failed to threaten four wide. BRILLANT MIND floated wide through the first turn to be seven wide into the backstretch and was always back. BILLIE MAE
saved ground and was outrun. BLESSINGS NOTED bobbled at the start, chased the pace four and five wide to the far turn and tired. DANBURITE bumped
with rivals at the start, was outside and drifted out in the far turn.

Footnotes
PIERPONT moved to the front through the first about the two or three path, shook off a bid from CHOIR DIRECTOR into the far turn to move clear again
then held a safe margin under steady handling. THEBOYFROMJERSEY was five wide through the first turn, tracked the pace four wide to the far turn to
gained the place in the drive. MR RED SENSATION saved ground and made a mild rally through the far turn and missed the place late.
RUNAROUNDDANCING stalked the leaders from four wide, fanned six wide into the lane and could not threaten late. CHOIR DIRECTOR took back early to
move outside the winner in the first turn, challenged up the backstretch and weakened into the lane. BIG HEARTED FACTOR was caught six wide in the
first turn and lacked a solid rally. JUNKERS saved ground and failed to mount a bid. DANCE EVEN tracked the pace from three wide and weakened. KING
OF ANYTHING was always back.
