Footnotes
EXPEDITER was urged to set the pace on a narrow margin in the two path racing through the backstretch into the turn, edged clear from between foes
racing into upper stretch and held the challenge of. AMERICANO to the end under firm right handed encouragement. The latter tracked just off the first flight
between foes in early stages, angled inwards on the turn while being prompted to bid inside the pacesetter between foes nearing upper stretch, switched
outside the leader entering the lane and continued willingly to close the gap to the end while always only second best. YOUNG AMERICAN angled to the
rail in early stages while being urged to prompt the pacesetter racing into the turn, pressed the issue into upper stretch and gave way. GAME DAY DRAMA,
urged to a forward placing three deep between foes racing to the turn, steadily faded nearing the lane. KING DUDE OF OCALA broke sharply, was urged
along four wide racing just off the first flight to the turn and soon gave way. MR. OCTOBER was settled out of striking position racing in the four path through
the backstretch and never gained contention. SUM OVERTURE raced inside foes dropping off leaders in the opening stages and soon retreated.
PASSIONATE HACHI tracked off the first flight racing five wide to the turn and soon gave way.

Footnotes
FAST FIONNUALA broke outwards bumping HYPERLOOP while carrying out that rival, was hustled between foes to gain a narrow advantage racing
through the backstretch, disputed the issue a bit off the rail through the turn, then forged clear into the stretch while being kept to firm left handed
encouragement. HYPERLOOP, restless in the gate, was bumped while being carried out by the eventual winner at the start, was righted to track just off the
leaders between foes racing into the bend, then continued with a steady effort to gain second from between foes racing into the stretch while never
regaining terms with the winner. FREEDOM LASS, urged to a forward placing four wide in the opening stages, continued in pursuit of the leaders three deep
on the bend and came up empty racing into the stretch. FLAMING INDY broke out bumping UNDENIABLY DEVINE, was righted quickly, then urged
prompting the pacesetter into the turn and gave way into upper stretch while shifting out. TIMELESS DI, urged from the break to gain a forward placing
along the rail racing to the turn, emptied out after a half. LINCOLN CENTER, caught in close quarters, then shuffled back at the start, tracked the leaders
between foes from out of striking distance to the lane and lacked a rally. FERLAND'S PROSPECT settled outside foes in early stages and failed to menace.
UNDENIABLY DEVINE, bumped at the start, then held up out of tight quarters, was guided to the inside early and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MOMENTO exchanged some contact with KARATBARS at the start, was held up last in the opening stages, angled out leaving the midway point of the turn
gathering momentum, shifted to the five path while finding his best stride in the last furlong and narrowly prevailed in time under firm left handed
encouragement. KARATBARS broke inwards exchanging bumps with the eventual winner, was urged to terms with a rival pressing the pace into the turn,
dueled for command to gain a clear advantage in upper stretch but faltered late while just edging a rival for the place honors on the wire. LA BELLE DE
COURSE was prompted to a forward placing between foes, tracked just off the first flight in the second furlong, switched out three deep nearing the bend
while being prompted to contend, advanced in that path racing into upper stretch to strike the front between calls nearing the wire but was just outfinished by
the top pair. SAMMY'S TOWN tracked the pace outside foes from just out of striking distance in the opening stages, angled to the inside entering the turn
while making brief progress to gain striking distance after a half, then flattened out while switching outside foes in the last furlong. MIAMI ROSE, urged to
dispute the pace inside a rivals from the outset shifting just off the inside, angled to the rail entering the turn dueling for command, pressed the issue to
upper stretch and abruptly gave out. ARNOLD'S PATSY was never a factor.

Footnotes
FINE SPIRIT, firmly rated in the opening stages to track off the second flight racing to the first turn, switched outside foes nearing the backstretch while
continuing to pull hard against restraint racing four wide through the backstretch, moved to terms with the leaders in that path racing into the far turn on his
own courage, struck the front in the three path approaching upper stretch and was roused to maintain a clear advantage to the end. NO REGRETS angled
inwards in the opening stages to track off the first flight between foes under rating, conceded some position under patient handling after a half, swung out
five wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady bid to prove best of the others. DANVILLE tracked the leaders three deep in second flight
racing to the backstretch, was held up momentarily nearing the second bend, shifted out four wide while being urged in pursuit of the eventual winner, then
continued three deep between foes into the lane while proving no match for the top pair. TRAVEL AGENT joined the pace outside rivals racing to the first
turn, prompted the issue between foes for a half, dueled for command while angling to the inside racing into the far turn to upper stretch and gave way in
late stages. ED'S DOG, forwardly placed between rivals tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, switched out entering the far turn and
continued evenly between foes to late stages. MR. MAURICE broke awkwardly losing position to the field, was switched outside foes on the backstretch,
raced wide to the lane and proved no real threat. DOPO LAVORO tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight, came through close quarters just off the
inside to improve position racing into the lane but never gained striking distance. HUSBAND IN LAW broke inwards brushing the eventual winner, was
pulling a bit while caught four wide racing into the first turn advancing on the leaders, prompted the pace three deep after a half, dueled between foes into
the far turn and gave way early. GLENN'S CAPER, urged to the lead while angling to the rail leaving the chute, dueled for command inside foes to the
backstretch and gave way after a half. BOATSWAIN angled to the rail racing into the first turn to track off the second flight under light reserve but dropped
out early.

Footnotes
MOLOKAI NIGHT gained terms with the first flight four wide in the opening stages, conceded some position to a rival tracking that foe into the turn,
continued with a steady bid to challenge for command racing into the stretch and edged clear under firm handling. HAPPY GUY was settled between foes
dropping off the second flight in early stages, made steady progress splitting rivals three deep racing into the lane, then shifted out late to edge a rival for the
place honors on the wire. ROW THE BOAT tracked off the first flight three wide between foes racing into the bend, shifted five wide in the closing stages
while continuing with interest and was just outkicked for second. ESOR joined the pace three deep in early stages, was urged clear racing into the bend
while remaining well off the rail, resisted the winner's challenge racing to midstretch but yielded late. NOT TELLING, urged inside foes racing a bit off the rail
prompting the pace racing to the turn, couldn't match the leaders and weakened into the stretch. STARSHIP FONZY settled outside foes dropping off the
second flight early, was prompted to split rivals four wide racing into the lane and improved position to the end. RICKY RUN tracked off the second flight
inside foes into the turn and continued evenly. JUST SHOOT ALREADY, urged between foes in the opening stages prompting the pace, continued in pursuit
of the leaders through the turn and gave way late. SIR SWAYSALOT tracked off the first flight while angling inside and faded early. SALLY'S SALUTE, held
up avoiding close quarters in early stages, never proved a serious threat. BOLTER, bumped from both sides and shuffled back at the start, never menaced
thereafter. ERIN GO BRAUGH, caught six wide as part of the second flight in the opening stages, soon dropped out.

commencing a steady advance, steadily gained on the pacesetter three wide through the far turn to upper stretch and produced a sustained response to
wrest the advantage in time under stout left handed pressure then was taken in hand once striking the front approaching the wire. VALIANT VIRTUE gained
terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the first turn, gained a narrow advantage after a half, dueled for command racing just off the rail into the far turn,
dispatched a rival's challenge to go clear midstretch but just failed to contain the winner. BRONX RUMBLE tracked the leaders between foes in second flight
to the backstretch, advanced to press the issue between foes just outside the leader racing into the far turn but came up empty nearing midstretch.
CARAMELITO, held up off the second flight along the inside racing to the far turn, switched out three wide racing into the lane and finished willingly to close
the gap. KID DRAMA, reserved near the inside in the opening five furlongs, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a mild bid.
INDY RIDE angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, shifted out after a half to make some brief progress between rivals pursuing
the leaders into the far turn but came up empty nearing the lane. OLYMPIC ROMP settled along the inside racing to the backstretch and failed to menace.
GATOR POSSE, caught four wide in second flight racing to the backstretch, emptied out early. HIGH THRESHOLD hesitated at the start losing position to
the field and proved no factor. FIRST HOMESTEAD, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival racing to the backstretch, emptied out racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
BIG YES was urged to the lead from the break while being switched sharply off the inside to dispute the issue inside foes racing into the turn, continued to
stave off challengers in a stiff drive racing through the turn to upper stretch and kicked clear while being kept to firm right handed pressure. AWESOME
ROMEO exchanged bumps with K C TWOSTEP at the start, was righted to track between foes in second flight racing through the backstretch, split foes just
off the inside racing into upper stretch and edged a rival for the place honors. SOMETHING BIRD was settled off the second flight in the opening stages,
steadily gained position four wide between rivals on the turn to upper stretch and was just outkicked for second. THE EXCEPTION tracked the leaders
outside rivals in second flight racing to the turn, was caught five wide on the bend to upper stretch while being prompted to advance but lacked the needed
late bid. SACCO AND VANZETTI, in hand attending the pace five wide through the backstretch, gained terms with the leader on his own courage to loom in
that path under confident handling nearing upper stretch, came under some right handed prompting entering the stretch and proved empty in the drive.
BRANDY CHASER angled to the rail tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, shifted out nearing the lane and continued evenly between foes late.
INDIAN BUZZ raced four wide between foes as part of the second flight to the turn but offered no rally. K C TWOSTEP exchanged bumps at the start,
angled to the inside racing through the backstretch tracking just off the leaders to the turn, then faded along the rail into the stretch. LEAVING HOME, held
up avoiding close quarters at the start, failed to menace thereafter. SILAO switched outside the pacesetter while being roused between foes prompting the
pace through the backstretch. gave way early. DRAFTABLE, urged three, then four wide between rivals prompting the pace in the opening quarter, gave
way between foes entering the bend.

SMALL FORTUNE, forwardly placed three deep between foes in the opening stages, conceded some position to the pacesetter tracking that rival from
within striking distance racing into the bend and continued with a steady bid to take over in late stages under firm encouragement. KITCHEN FIRE sped to
the lead just off the rail in the opening stages, held sway on a clear margin to upper stretch but faltered in late stages. LUDINGTON ducked out at the start
momentarily impeding WEEKEND WIZARD, was taken up off that foe while dropping out last, swung out five wide racing into the stretch and continued with
interest to gain some position. TOWN CLASSIC tracked off the second flight outside foes, continued four wide through the turn to upper stretch but lacked
the needed late bid. ZORB tracked off the leaders three wide between foes racing into the turn and faded after a half. FAMOUS N FLASHY angled to the rail
early tracking just off the pacesetter, saved ground on the bend and gave way into upper stretch. CAKE POP proved no factor. WEEKEND WIZARD,
shuffled avoiding tight quarters at the break, switched off the inside while being in brief pursuit of the leaders between foes but quickly came empty.
