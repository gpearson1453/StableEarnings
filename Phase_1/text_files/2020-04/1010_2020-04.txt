Footnotes
ONE FOR RICHIE in the second flight off the inside, two path through the turn, angled out a bit to be three wide into the lane, engaged the leader
approaching the furlong grounds, wore that foe down under firm handling. SCORING forwardly placed from the start outside, stalked into the turn, took over
three wide turning for home, dueled with the winner inside that one past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end, clearly second best. BEEMIE
AWARD void of speed for a half, angled out turning for home, along for the show, not a threat to the top two. CABOT settled off the pace and the inside,
lacked a serious response in the drive while between horses at the wire. MR. ANKENY broke out a bit, set or forced the pace along the inside, weakened in
the drive. HERE COMES KYLE in the second flight for a half along the inside, little left for the drive. GETALOADOFTHIS with the pace off the inside, gave
way turning for home while between rivals.

Footnotes
COLD SMOKE broke to the inside, advanced to be close up early inside, clear before a quarter, breather turn, continued to hold a large advantage into and
through upper stretch while being kept to task, no threatened the final furlong while wrapped up late. DIGITAL STAR in the main body just off the inside,
proved no match for the winner in the drive, held sway for the place. NEVERBLINK back off the pace and the inside, floated out four wide into the lane,
rallied for the show outside. MY NAME IS PHRED lacked early foot toward the inside, angled out steadily to be three wide and in some traffic late in the
turn, displayed some mild interest to improve position. BEAR OAK within striking distance early along the inside, steadied when in tight midway on the turn,
fell back and did not recover. BROTHER MARTIN hesitated at the start, well back early as a result, came five wide out of the turn, improved slightly upper
stretch then flattened out to finish up evenly. MR. SHAPOOR broke alertly, fell back off the pace while three wide into the turn, improved turn, faltered.
FIRST STRING void of speed, remained always back. MR. SCISSORS forwardly placed while racing outside, chased the winner through the turn and gave
way. EXHORT closest to the winner early, began a steady fade toward the inside before a half.

Footnotes
PAT DADDY never far back just off the inside, steadied slightly in traffic midway on the turn, roused for the drive, challenged between rivals inside the
furlong marker, dug in late to prevail in game fashion. ROCKSHAW forwardly placed for a half inside,steered out to be three wide turning for home, bit
closer past the furlong marker, not enough in the late going while widest of the first flight. BIG BELLA BROWN broke alertly, set the pace just off the inside,
continued to show the way into and through upper stretch, gave ground grudgingly to the top pair. NO DISTORTION back off the pace inside, two path into
the lane, improved position a bit while not a threat to the top three. BOW AND ARROW off a step slow, moved up to mid pack outside, four wide into the
lane, lacked a closing kick. TOP BRASS lacked speed, shuffled back a bit into the turn, failed to menace. COWBOY COOL void of speed, remained always
back while racing outside. SOVEREIGN IMPACT pressed the early pace outside, faded.

Footnotes
TASHKENT with the pace while three wide into the first turn, prompted the issue up the backstretch while remaining outside, took over turning for home,
drove steadily clear under steady handling. LADDIE BOY broke out but toward the front, narrowly set the pace inside, continued to show the way the middle
half, could not keep up with the winner through the stretch, clear of the other while remaining inside. ON PATROL also with the pace from the start, vied
between the top two, weakened gradually through the lane, just managed to save the show. TAKE CHARGE D'ORO settled off the pace while outside,
remained well out in the strip through the second turn, managed little in the way of gain on the top two, narrowly missed the show. DRIVEN TO COMPETE
off slow then steadied, trailed well back, steered out to be three wide when beginning a mild advance late in the final turn, improved position while not
posing a serious threat. ALL ABOUT ASHLEY lacked speed, raced four wide through the second turn,made little impact in the drive. ZANESVILLE failed to
menace. HANNITY restless in the gate, settled in the second flight early, tired. FIVE STAR KIP was finished early. HE WILL back off the early pace, moved
closer with a five advance far turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
SOUIXPER CHARGER broke on top, showed the way into the first turn by daylight, rated in the run up the backstretch, extended advantage stretch, lugged
out midstretch, maintained comfortable advantage after being straightened. SIR BRAHMS carried out into the first turn, dropped inside to save some
ground, moved closer in the second turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, remained clear for the place. PROSPECTOR FEVER lacked early
foot, came four wide into the stretch, staged a mild rally to earn the show, not a threat to the top two. REEF'S DESTINY a bit rank when with the main body
into the first turn, moved out and advanced with a three wide middle move in the second turn, flattened out in the drive. OCTOBER SKY void of speed, in
some traffic midway on the final turn, went evenly when clear for the drive. HEISFANCY broke back, devoid of speed, passed faltering foes while never a
threat. YOUNG BULL ducked out at the start, carried out five wide into the first turn, one paced the middle half, tired in the drive. SUNDAY SERMON got out
into the first turn carrying out a pair of outer rivals, chased the winner up the backstretch and into the far turn, gave way in the drive. EAST MOON LAKE
was never involved in showing little. LIEUTENANT POWELL carried out into the first turn, remained forwardly placed early off the inside, pulled up suddenly
before a half, vanned off. STRAWN'S CASH sluggish in racing back, pulled up late first turn, walked back.

Footnotes
J P'S GLADYS outrun early, patiently handled in some traffic into the far turn, advanced three wide into the stretch, lodged a bid between horses inside the
furlong ground, drove clear under firm handling. DESHA slight bobble at the start to be last away, trailed, saved ground through the turn, rallied up the inside
to gain the nod for the place in the final strides. SHAHARAZAD also back off the early pace, in traffic when rallying past the furlong marker, continued
willingly to the wire to narrowly miss the place. COWGIRL CALLIE in the second flight outside, four out to five wide turning for home, displayed some
interest out in the middle of the strip while lacking enough late punch to garner the place. ARROWSPHERE vied up front while between horses early, dueled
through the turn while closest to the inside, gave way in the drive. BLUSHING BELLA fractious in the gate, settled off the pace just off the rail, came up
empty when called on for the drive. DICHOTOMY remained always back in failing to threaten. DAAHERACHEL vied up front with the early pace while three
wide, dueled through the turn while remaining off the rail, backed up in the drive. SMOKIN HOT MOMMA flashed brief speed along the inside early, began a
steady fade before three furlongs.

Footnotes
CARLOS SIXES with the early pace three wide, fell back before a half, rebid between horses far turn, stretch duel, proved best in a game effort. FROST OR
FRIPPERY settled off the early pace and the inside, advanced four wide late in the final turn, challenged the winner from the outside, dueled through the
lane, outkicked in the late going, clearly second best. MAGIC VOW back off the early pace inside, continued to save ground out of the final turn while
improving into the stretch, no match for the top two late, held sway for the show. CURLIN GREY void of early foot, continued back into the far turn, two path
into lane, encountered some traffic midstretch, steered in a bit to continue a mild rally. WILD ABOUT YOU fell far back to be devoid of early foot, continued
back while remaining toward the inside, improved position while finding his best stride too late. CHARLIE'SARCHANGEL turned in a one paced effort while
off the inside. RED AGAIN with the early pace just off the inside, dueled the middle half and gave way. CANADIAN GAME four wide into the first turn, failed
to muster a rally. THE ROUGE DIESEL remained back in failing to ever menace. FIRST MASAMUNE off a step slow, was never a factor. VOKAZAK
sluggish, was always outrun. OCEAN FURY was used early to vie into the first turn, dueled the next four furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
LETRUSKA broke well, showed the way past the wire the first time, set a comfortable pace under light restraint middle half, drew out to extend his
advantage into the lane, held the runner up comfortably safe late under firm handling. NONNA MADELINE broke with the leaders, stalked the winner off the
inside, had little for that one in the drive, clearly second best. SARA SEA within striking distance while saving ground and under a snug hold, steadied
slightly into the far turn, continued to save ground into the lane, finished up best of the rest. GOODBYE EARL in tight at the start, settled toward the inside
early, moved out late in the final turn, improved position while not a serious threat. UNIQUE FACTOR turned in an even effort while racing mostly in the
three path. CALF MOON BAY four wide into the first turn, continued outside, four wide again through the second bend, went evenly to lose some position
late. ROYAL GEM bobbled at the start, raced back, improved along the inside into the stretch, flattened out a bit in the late going. GLAMORIZED settled in
mid pack off the inside, three wide second turn, had little left for the stretch run. SEEDS OF TIME back off the early pace and the inside, saved ground
through the second turn and tired. RAHWAY in mid pack and inside, moved out to be four wide final turn, backed up in the drive. MONGOLIAN HUMOR
sluggish from the start, far back, distanced after losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
AGGRESSIVITY lacked early foot, asked along in the two path into the lane, switched to the far outside past the furlong, finished with a strong burst to win
going away. MARKET KING settled off the pace out in the strip, came four wide out of the turn, rallied with the winner past the furlong marker inside that
rival, proved no match for that same foe late, clear for the place. SPECIAL RESERVE within striking distance outside, raced four wide through the turn,
could not match strides with the top two the final furlong, all out to narrowly hold the show. TAKE CHARGE NOW in the second flight while racing off the
inside, lacked a significant late punch to miss the show. FIRERY TALE broke back, lacked speed inside, steered out late in the turn, improved position with
some late interest out in the strip. ATTAIN SUCCESS raced four wide throughout, lacked a rally. JACK VAN BERG broke alertly, set the pace inside, shook
well clear in the turn, could not last. RUN AWAY BETT closest to the early leader inside, began a steady fade before a half. TEMPLE BAR off a step slow,
was never close. IMPEACHABLEOFFENSE settled in mid pack out in the strip, bore out late in the turn, fell back and did not recover. THREE FOOTER
showed little to be always outrun. STARRING JOHN WAIN off slow, trailed far back throughout.
