Footnotes
CALENTITA (IRE) raced near the inside unhurried for six furlongs, moved to the two-path and took over turning for home, and held LASKA at bay under
pressure. LASKA was four wide early before moving inside, followed behind CELENTITA rallying past the quarter-pole, had aim through the stretch but
could not reach that one while best of the others. DELIA'S PRIDE advanced four then five wide around the far turn, and was up outside for the show near
the wire. SYLLABUS broke in bumping CALLMESENORITA, prompted the pace to the stretch, and weakened. CALLMESENORITA was bumped and
bothered by SYLLABUS at the start, saved ground to the far turn, swung four wide into the lane and offered a mild response. DAMA DE NOCHE saved
ground early, raced three then four wide around the far turn, and lacked a solid bid. TAPIZAR GIRL had the rail in range early, switched out three wide on
the far turn, and could not gain. MALAGA was slow into stride, came about eight wide off the far turn and posed no threat. GRACIE'S DREAM was four wide
early, and tired. PASATIME set the pace inside, and gave way once overhauled into the stretch. PRINCESA CRYSTAL (GB) tracked outside the leaders
three wide, and tired after six furlongs. AMBER PRINCESS stayed in range two wide early, and tired inside through the drive.

Footnotes
GREY JAZMINE sprinted to the front after the start, rated along slightly off the inside fending off pursuers after a half-mile, and widened the advantage
drifting out on the wrong lead. CABRINA chased between horses for a half, and ran on much best of the others. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL hit the left side of
the gate at the start, gave chase three wide to the quarter-pole and tired. WATER WIZARD was no factor two wide. TRINNI SUNSHINE bumped with
CRESPUCULA at the start, raced three then four wide around the turn, and tired. PAZYARMONIA was finished early. BUST OUT LADY saved ground and
tired under pressure on the turn. CRESPUCULA bumped with TRINNI SUNSHINE at the start, and was done early inside.

BELLA BIONDA dashed to the front early, showed the way inside to the stretch, and held on while drifting out. PRINCESS AVRIL was forwardly placed from
the outset, had aim outside the winner through the lane, gained gradually but did not have enough. HECHIZADA saved ground around the turn in the
second flight, and rallied along the rail for a share. DOTDOTDASH broke slowly, steadied along inside hard to handle for three furlongs, moved to the far
outside for the drive and finished with interest. NEW YORK COMMANDER raced two wide through an even effort. MIRIANA'S QUEEN was no factor two
wide. LOVELY LEE raced three wide and failed to factor. TOO STYLISH chased outside the winner for three furlongs and tired. MAKE A MINT was always
outrun. AWESOME LIGHT was slow to get going after brushing the left side of the gate, and never got close. AWESOME EVIL was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
PAYNTER FEST took command early, rated along well removed from the inside to the stretch, and was kept to pressure to win comfortably. TIME TO TWO
STEP was four wide to the turn, shifted in a path at the top of the lane, lugged in to the rail and held the place. KAUFY FUTURES advanced two wide
around the turn, but lacked a further response. STORMY BOSS raced two wide improving mildly after six furlongs, but had nothing further. JOPLIN chased
four wide early, and tired. STAMINA PRINCESS was never involved. COUNTRY STRONG was forwardly placed inside leaving the chute, but could not
keep pace under urging before going a half-mile. SAMOA chased inside the winner early, and was through before reaching the stretch. LOOKING FOR
MORE retired early. ALAFIA was done early.

Footnotes
WILLING TO SPEED was never far back, got put to pressure by midway on the far turn three wide, stayed on task taking over into the final furlong, edged
clear late and had enough to hold on. TRICKY MAGICIAN steadied inside under a firm hold on the first turn and into the backstretch, moved out widest for
the drive and was getting to the winner late. VALDOLOBO (IRE) tracked outside CARBON DATA for six furlongs, poked a head in front through the furlong
grounds confidently handled, suddenly began to labor when asked and was no match for the winner a sixteenth out, and faltered barely salvaging the show.
MAJESTIC LUNA saved ground to the stretch, shifted to the two-path and finished willingly, but did not have enough. CARBON DATA set the pace inside to
upper stretch, and gave way on the rail. TIZ LUNA steadied behind TRICKY MAGICIAN after the start, and was outrun. DERMOT took a bad step leaving
the first turn, got pulled up quickly, and was vanned off.

UNTITLED led the way out of the chute and set the pace along the inside down the backstretch, remained clear and confidently handled around the far turn
then came under mild prompting and stayed sharp. GRAY BEAU was allowed to settle through early stages, launched a three wide bid around the turn,
remained in steady pursuit in stretch run and got a nose up to capture place. FIRST AND THREE tracked the pace down the backstretch then launched a
bid along the inside on the turn, cut the corner entering top stretch, sustained a steady bid into the lane then got nipped for place in final stride. ROMAN
EMPIRE stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch, made a bid for the leader around the turn then gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
TIZZARUNNER rated off the early pace and saved ground near the inside, picked up the pace three wide on the far turn, advanced closer then stayed on
determinedly under right handed pressure, roused forward and took command from DR. EDGAR near the furlong marker and finished clear. DR. EDGAR
hustled up out of the gate and fanned four wide entering the first turn, vied for the lead along the outside down the backstretch then shook free nearing the
quarter pole, remained on top into the lane then failed to have enough in reserve to hold off the winner. MOROCCO was well placed positioned just off the
pressured top flight, launched a three wide bid on the far turn, lacked the needed surge for victory but sustained a steady bid to hold a share. GRAND
JOURNEY raced off the early pace, angled out then put top pressure top of the lane and switched in a couple paths then roused left handed and shifted out
wider in late stages, finished with interest and narrowly missed show. BIG AGENDA was unhurried down the backstretch, roused four wide on the far turn
then lacked the needed response in stretch run for impact. MEGACITY stalked along the inside through early stages, launched a two wide bid on the far turn
then failed to sustain response entering the lane. PIVEN raced in the back and saved ground, hustled along four to five wide entering the lane and lacked a
needed rally. DRIVEN BY THUNDER held a slim lead under pressure through early stages, vied with DR. EDGAR into the far turn then tired in the drive.
GEMONTEER vied for the early lead then retreated, galloped home under no exertion from the rider then got vanned off after the race.

under steady pressure along outside and kicked clear in the lane. BIRD MAP rated in range down the backstretch, vied three wide around the far turn,
battled on to the furlong marker then failed to hold off the challenge from the winner. TOPO GRIGIO was forwardly placed through early stages, vied for the
lead racing inside a duo on the turn, fought back to the furlong marker then lacked closing response. ADDISON was reserved three wide in the back, raced
under a drive five to six wide in the lane and lacked a needed rally. LIL MISS HOT MESS stalked down the backstretch, vied between foes on the turn then

TEMPLE was allowed to settle while saving ground through early stages, was never too far back then picked up the pace entering the far turn, waited at the
quarter pole then hustled up turning for home, dug in gamely along the rail to take control and held firm. ARTHUR KITT (GB) was unhurried down the
backstretch, hustled up three to four wide on the far turn then sustained a solid bid in the lane but could not get to the winner. OPRY stalked along the
inside, launched a bid on the far turn, lost a few positions upper stretch but chased on with response and prevailed for a share. AWARD WINNER stalked
the pacesetter to the far turn, hustled along and raced three to four wide in aim for the lead at the furlong marker then flattened out. RY'S THE GUY tracked
the early pace, launched a bid on the far turn then hit traffic upper stretch, angled out wider and had a mild improve. THUNDER RIDE set the pace and held

and lacked the needed response for impact. KRAMPUS was unhurried and saved ground entering top stretch, switched out a couple paths and showed
some interest but raced in traffic and steadied in the final sixteenth. RIJEKA (IRE) got clipped behind into the first turn, raced off the pace and saved ground
to no avail. NEEPAWA tracked the pace down the backstretch, launched a bid on the far turn, continued in range near the eighth pole then gave way.

response for a share. SWEET STORY fanned wide on the first turn, raced off the pace then raced widest entering the lane and improved position. DIXIE
