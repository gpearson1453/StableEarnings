Footnotes
TALE OF A SONG was rated outside rivals in second flight in the opening stages, commenced a steady, three wide advance nearing upper stretch, took
over entering the lane and went clear under firm right handed encouragement. THE GREAT LOUDINI settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the turn,
advanced four wide on the bend, shifted out five wide nearing the stretch and continued with a steady late bid to prevail for second. YOUNG AMERICAN
tracked the leaders as part of the second flight racing into the turn, shifted out in upper stretch to gain position three deep between foes but was outkicked
for the place honors. JAIDEN'S BEST was settled off the second flight between foes early, shifted out three wide nearing the lane and improved position
between foes. RED ROSE CAT tracked just off the second flight along the inside, switched out racing into the lane and gained some position in an even
effort. PASSIONATE HACHI, urged between foes disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. CRAZY FRANK C
was settled between foes early and proved no threat. SOLITARY JACK, urged inside rivals through the backstretch pressing the pace, gave way after a half.
STERLING GENERAL proved no factor. BIG GILLETTE joined the pace three wide in the opening stages and gave way racing into the turn.

Footnotes
MR. QUALITY broke sharply to gain a forward placing along the rail attending the pace, conceded some position racing through the backstretch, continued
with a steady bid to prompt the leader along the rail nearing upper stretch and edged forward through the lane under energetic handling. BURNING BRIGHT
broke readily, pulled his way to the lead outside a rival racing into the first turn, moved away to a clear advantage entering the backstretch, continued to
dispute the issue just outside the eventual winner resisting that rival to late stages but proved only second best. ACCESSIBLE, off a bit slowly, tracked off
the second flight in the opening half, shifted out to race in the four path through the far turn while being prompted to advance but had no closing response.
CARL G tracked just off the leaders in the three path into the backstretch, and faded between foes leaving the midway point of the far turn.
JUSTCUZIFEELLIKEIT tracked just off the first flight inside foes racing to the backstretch, lost some position to those foes on the far turn and gave way
nearing the lane. MEDIATE hesitated in the gate at the start, then broke in the air, was settled well off the leaders to the backstretch and lacked a response
when being prompted to gain contention.

Footnotes
PASSING OUT, reserved last racing to the first turn, switched outside foes midway through the backstretch commencing her advance, steadily drew on
terms with the first flight while shifting out three wide nearing midstretch, then wrested the advantage and went well clear late under firm encouragement.
ROSEBUD'S HOPE, in touch with the pacesetter from the outset prompting that foe under light restraint, pressed the issue on the far turn into upper stretch
to gain a brief advantage but proved no match when confronted by the winner. SOLAR KITTEN was settled in the last flight while angling to the inside racing
to the backstretch, switched out nearing the lane to split rivals just off the inside and continued with interest to gain some position. CLASSY WOMAN,
forwardly placed along the rail in the opening stages, conceded some position to track the first flight from just out of striking distance along the inside to the
backstretch, shifted out nearing midstretch while being prompted to advance but had no closing bid. RED CURLS settled outside foes racing well off the
leaders to the backstretch, angled out five wide entering the stretch and passed some tiring rivals. BRAMBLE QUEEN reserved between foes racing to the
backstretch, offered no rally. STEELIN MAGNOLIAS was roused to gain the lead from between foes racing to the first turn, angled to the rail once gaining
the advantage, dueled for command inside a rival racing to the far turn and gave out entering the lane. WISH UPON, reserved inside foes in the opening
half, came under prompting to advance while caught in close quarters racing through the far turn and lacked the needed late response. SURPRISE AGAIN
tracked the first flight from just out of striking distance to the backstretch racing a bit off the rail, shifted inwards under pressure entering the second bend
and gave way racing through the far turn.

Footnotes
KALU, rated inside foes in the opening stages, came under prompting to advance racing into the turn, switched outside a tiring rival leaving the midway
point of the bend, angled to the rail to bid inside the pacesetter entering upper stretch, then wrested a narrow advantage in time under firm left handed
encouragement. MISTER STORM joined the pace outside foes to press the issue three deep into the turn, edged away to clear advantage while shifting
inwards nearing upper stretch, resisted the winner to late stages but proved only second best. STRIKING HEIR tracked just off the first flight in the opening
quarter, shifted out four wide entering the turn while being urged to advance on the leaders but lacked the needed final kick while prevailing for a share.
ACTSPECTATION vied for command between foes racing through the backstretch, was eased outside the leader to race three wide between foes entering
the turn while continuing to press the issue but weakened entering the lane. I'LL MAKE U FAMOUS was settled off the second flight racing to the turn, then
split foes into the stretch to improve position late. NICOLE MUNNINGS, held up avoiding tight quarters early, never gained contention. SHAKEM N
BREAKEM was settled outside foes racing behind the second flight to the turn, was fanned six wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. GILDED DRAMA,
urged inside rivals from the outset prompting the pace into the turn, gave way early. MIKADO, off last, proved no factor. UNFLAPPABLE MAX tracked the
leaders outside rivals in second flight in early stages, was caught five wide racing through the turn and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
TABLED angled to the inside in the opening stages while being rated out of striking distance to race as part of the second flight, steadied out of tight
quarters losing some position nearing the three furlong marker, switched out four wide nearing upper stretch while making steady progress to advance on
MR. KRINGLE and wrested the advantage from that foe to go clear in time under firm left handed encouragement. The latter tracked the leaders under light
reserve just outside the eventual winner in the opening half, was prompted to advance three deep racing into the far turn, moved to gain the advantage
between calls entering upper stretch, resisted the winner to late stages and was taken in hand approaching the wire once the issue was decided.
ASSIDUOUSLY (GB) settled off the second flight racing to the backstretch, switched out after a half while being prompted to advance and continued with
interest to gain position while prevailing for a share. CADET CONNELLY, prompted to a forward placing while angling inwards, conceded the lead to stalk
just off the first flight while pulling a bit against rating, shifted out three deep midway through the backstretch to advance, pressed the issue between foes
into the far turn and gave way leaving midstretch. PRETENDANT, reserved between rivals tracking off the second flight to the far turn, never gained
contention. AMENDS broke slowly, was settled last to the backstretch, then angled five wide entering the lane while proving no real threat. ALLEY OOP
JOHNNY, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace from the outset, pressed the issue between foes through the backstretch and gave way nearing the lane.
SKY MISCHIEF, reserved off the second flight along the inside while a bit rank in the opening stages, continued inside foes to the second bend, then was
checked midway through that bend avoiding a tiring rival while quickly dropping out. DRIFTWOOD, urged disputing the pace inside a rival from the outset
into the backstretch, gave way abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
COMMANDER OF DEATH, forwardly placed three deep tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance, continued with a steady advance in that
path to wrest the advantage racing into upper stretch, then held PLUIE D'AVRIL on a safe margin through the closing stages under brisk handling. The
latter, bumped from both sides at the start, was righted quickly to track just off the leaders between foes, split rivals advancing nearing upper stretch to loom
briefly outside the winner in upper stretch but flattened out late. GIFTED PATH was urged to a clear lead from the break, dictated the pace off the rail racing
into the turn, then weakened once headed entering upper stretch. RACHIELY'S DREAM tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, angled
inwards nearing the lane and improved position between foes in late stages. AND I KNOW ducked out at the start, was settled between foes dropping well
off the leaders racing to the turn, swung out five wide nearing the lane while being prompted to advance and continued to make mild progress to the end.
PREMIER JUSTICE, bumped soundly, then shut off at the start, was righted to track off the second flight three deep between foes but offered no rally.
LADY AND ME tracked off the second flight along the inside early, came around a tiring foe while being prompted to advance nearing the lane but steadily
faded in late stages. MISS LOTUS FLOWER settled inside foes in the last flight early and failed to menace. SHARPERTHANME shied at the break bumping
PLUIE D'AVRIL, was righted to make brief pursuit of the leaders inside foes in the second flight but gave way early. ELUSIVE AURA swerved inwards at the
start bumping PREMIER JUSTICE, then VICTIM, was righted quickly to track the leaders three deep in second flight racing to the turn and gave way into the
stretch. VICTIM, bumped at the start, settled between foes in the last flight and never menaced thereafter. BOSS OF THE HOUSE, pinched back at the
start, dropped out early.

Footnotes
NORTH DAKOTA, reserved in hand outside a rival as part of the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled nearer the rail midway through the backstretch
while continuing under patient handling, was held up momentarily when lacking a path to advance entering the far turn, saved ground through the far turn,
was prompted to advance along the rail when presented an opening in upper stretch and continued with a sustained response to wrest the advantage from
inside the pacesetter to go clear in time under strong handling. THAT QUALITY sprinted clear of the field while angling to the rail nearing the first turn pulling
slightly against rating, maintained a clear advantage to the second bend, turned back a rival's challenge to regain a clear margin racing past midstretch but
couldn't contain the winner's bid. JACK THE CAT, reserved outside foes racing to the backstretch, shifted inwards on the eventual winner midway through
the backstretch, advanced three deep racing into the far turn, swung out four wide entering upper stretch but couldn't match the top pair in the drive. LAST
PROMISE tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight in the opening half, advanced to lodge a brief bid outside the pacesetter leaving the far turn
but flattened out entering the lane. TY RAN A HOMER, off slowly, angled inside early tracking just off the second flight to the backstretch and steadily faded
nearing the lane. GENTLEMAN JOE was settled along the inside as part of the last flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. CORAL LEGACY
tracked the pacesetter outside a rival as part of the second flight but steadily faded racing into the far turn. CHILI MAC N CHEESE proved no factor.

Footnotes
STOLEN HOLIDAY broke readily, pulled her way to the lead while angling to the rail racing into the first turn dictating terms on a narrow margin, maintained
that advantage into the second bend, then came under left handed pressure to turn back a challenge from TILSA racing into the stretch to go clear under
firm handling. The latter broke readily racing on terms with the eventual winner in the opening sixteenth, was rated to stalk just off that rival along the inside
racing to the backstretch, shifted out leaving the midway point of the far turn to challenge nearing upper stretch, couldn't match terms with the winner but
proved best of the others while being gathered up nearing the wire. LIPSTIKLIESNLOVERS, reserved last to the backstretch while racing along the rail,
saved ground on the far turn, shifted out slightly to split rivals just off the inside in upper stretch and made some late progress to prevail for a share. CURLY
WURLY tracked off the second flight inside foes under reserve racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued evenly. NEVER
FORGET, caught four wide racing through the first turn while part of the second flight, was prompted to advance in that path entering the second bend and
emptied out in the drive. FRESHMAN CLASS was prompted to gain a position three deep between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out
nearing the lane, was fanned five wide into the stretch and faded in the closing stages. KITTEN EMPRESS, forwardly placed prompting the pacesetter
racing into the backstretch, continued three deep between foes leaving the midway point of the far turn and gave way into the stretch. DATA DOLL, urged to
gain a position three deep racing as part of the second flight into the backstretch, steadily faded nearing the lane. DOUBLE THAT tracked just off the
second between foes in the opening stages, dropped out nearing the lane and raced wide through late stages.
