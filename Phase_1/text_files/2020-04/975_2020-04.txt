Footnotes
MANCORA broke readily to gain a narrow advantage racing in the five path in the opening sixteenth, shifted inwards to prompt the pace three deep racing
to the turn, dueled between foes in that path leaving the midway point of the turn, drifted out into the path of OUR PETUNIA carrying that rival out nearing
the three sixteenths marker but edged clear late under firm encouragement. OUR PETUNIA was rated between rivals tracking just off the first flight in the
opening stages, shifted out four deep on the turn advancing on the leaders, was carried out racing into upper stretch, lost some ground to MANCORA late
but held grudgingly for the place honors. CANDY FOR ALL, urged to prompt the pace inside foes in the opening stages, eased back off the leaders after the
opening quarter, shifted out on the turn and continued with a solid second effort to regain position between rivals while narrowly prevailing for a share on the
wire. ANIMAUXSELLE was settled outside foes in the opening stages, advanced to contention shifting out to the five path on the turn but flattened out
racing past midstretch. ONLY IN AUGUST tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening stages, was urged to gain some position between foes
racing into the turn, angled inwards entering the lane and lacked the needed late bid. FIDDLER broke slowly while bobbling at the start, was settled last to
the turn and made some belated progress between rivals. HEARTY PARTY tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight in the opening quarter but
steadily faded racing into the turn. GUCCIGUCCIGIRL angled inwards while being urged to terms between foes prompting the pace between foes racing
into the turn but gave way abruptly after a half. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF OUR PETUNIA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF MANCORA WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED MANCORA FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER SECOND.

DON'T FIGHT was settled in hand while shifting outside foes in the opening quarter racing just behind the second flight, commenced an advance racing four
wide into the turn to gain terms with the leaders nearing upper stretch and continued under firm left handed pressure in a prolonged drive to prevail.
ELUSIVE AURA was rated tracking just outside the first flight in the opening quarter, advanced to bid for command three deep between foes nearing upper
stretch, grudgingly resisted the winner in a protracted skirmish but came up second best. LADY AND ME was settled between foes dropping off the second
flight racing to the turn, angled out five wide nearing the lane and continued with an effort to gain position. SASSY MISS MARGIE, outpaced in early stages,
angled inwards nearing the turn, then improved position between foes just off the inside in late stages. CASCABELL QUEEN hopped at the start, was urged
to terms with the first flight inside foes prompting the leaders in the opening stages, was eased back from that position to track off the first flight, shifted out
to the five path entering the lane but had no rally. SWEET GELATO joined the pace three deep in the opening stages, pressed the issue between foes into
the turn and gave way. VICTIM tracked the pace between foes in second flight racing to the turn and faded early. PLUIE D'AVRIL tracked the leaders inside
rivals as part of the second flight and gave way racing into the turn. RITA OF CASCIA shifted off the inside from the outset while being urged between foes
disputing the issue, then along the inside racing into the turn but gave way into the stretch.

Footnotes
PHILOSOPHY shied at the start to break behind the leaders, was hustled to gain the advantage while angling to the rail under some right handed prompting
in the opening stages, dueled for command on a narrow advantage racing through the turn and forged clear leaving midstretch under firm encouragement.
MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE gained a forward placing while angling to the inside tracking just inside the pacesetter racing into the turn and continued with
interest inside a rival to narrowly prevail for the place honors in late stages. I'M CARDINAL, in touch with the pacesetter between foes stalking that rival
under light rating racing to the turn, pressed the issue on the bend into upper stretch but proved no match late. MR LIGHTNING BOY, forwardly placed three
deep in the opening stages, shifted in entering the turn to track off the first flight outside a rival, shifted out three wide entering the lane but lacked the
needed late bid. THE ZIP ZIP MAN was settled outside dropping well off the leaders racing to the turn, angled out four wide in upper stretch and gained
some position between foes late. NO WAY NEVER (IRE) tracked off the second flight along the inside racing into the turn and never gained contention.
KHOLSTOMER tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening stages, was fanned five wide racing through the stretch and had no rally.
NOTACATBUTACARD tracked off the second flight between racing into the turn, was held up momentarily when caught in close midway through the turn
and quickly came up empty. SCARLET CITY angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. PURPLE
MONSTER dropped out early.

Footnotes
VIGILANTES WAY gained terms with the first flight between foes from the outset prompting the pace, edged forward to a narrow advantage racing into the
turn, turned back a challenge from ESTILO TALENTOSO racing into upper stretch and went clear under stiff left handed encouragement. The latter raced in
touch with the first flight three deep between foes attending the pace in the opening quarter, conceded some position to the pacesetter nearing the turn,
continued with a steady bid to press that rival midway through the bend to upper stretch but proved no match in the last furlong. RED VENUS, urged
disputing the pace inside rivals from the outset racing a bit off the rail, lost ground to the leaders nearing the turn while shifting out, continued in pursuit of
the top pair through the bend and steadily faded. PYTHONESS tracked off the first flight while angling inwards racing through the backstretch, shifted out
entering the lane but had no late response. SINISTER SIREN vied briefly four wide between foes racing just off the first flight on the backstretch and gave
way racing into the turn. DOUBLE THAT bobbled at the start, switched out five wide while being prompted to pursue the leaders five wide through the
backstretch but emptied out racing into the turn. BISCAYNE BAY broke slowly and trailed throughout. REIGN SHOWERS was scratched at the gate upon
order of the Stewards on the advice of the Veterinarian.

Footnotes
GRAVITAS, bumped at the start, was urged through close quarters to gain a narrow advantage along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage into
the backstretch, was prompted to widen that margin racing into upper stretch and just held the late challenge of ACCESSIBLE under strong handling. The
latter, reserved between foes, then along the inside in the opening half, shifted out nearing the far turn to split foes entering the second bend, advanced on
the leaders three wide into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner nearing the wire while just edging a rival for the place
honors. U S DELTA FORCE broke inwards exchanging solid contact with TINKER'S PAL, then was momentarily held up avoiding close quarters, tracked off
the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, steadily advanced to contention inside foes gaining a position just behind the pacesetter on the far turn,
shifted out slightly through the stretch while advancing on the leader and was just outkicked for second. PUNCH HARD, angled inwards tracking just off the
first flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out after a half gaining position between foes, continued in pursuit of the winner outside a rival to upper stretch,
ducked inwards leaving midstretch while racing between foes and had no final kick. JANGADA, urged to gain a forward placing three deep between foes
racing to the backstretch, was caught four wide racing into the far turn and had no closing bid. PSYCHIC DREAM, reserved avoiding close quarters in the
opening stages, never gained contention. TINKER'S PAL exchanged solid contact with U S DELTA FORCE at the start, then ducked inwards bumping the
eventual winner forcing that rival inwards, was quickly righted to prompt the pace between foes into the backstretch and emptied out racing into the far turn.
BELIEVEITORNOT settled well off the leaders racing to the backstretch and never seriously menaced. DISCO'S BRIDGE, urged to gain a forward placing
racing four wide into the first turn, dropped off the second flight while angling to the inside entering the far turn and soon gave way. DOM CAETANO (ARG)
broke slowly and trailed throughout.

FORT KING, brushed at the start, shifted inwards while being urged to gain a narrow advantage three deep between foes in the opening stages, dictated
the pace in the three path racing into the turn, met the challenge of a rival's bid nearing upper stretch, kicked away under a few right handed taps and
continued on his own courage nearing the wire once the issue was decided. WHITE DRILL tracked the pacesetter four deep in the opening stages as part of
the second flight, advanced in that path to challenge nearing upper stretch but proved no match while shifting in late. NOT TELLING, came through tight
quarters at the start while exchanging some contact with STERLING JUDGE to track just off the second flight between foes racing into the turn and
continued with a steady effort to prevail for a share in late stages while no match for the top pair. ROW THE BOAT broke inwards brushing the eventual
winner at the start, was righted to track off the second flight foes racing four wide early, gained some position three deep nearing upper stretch but lacked
the needed closing bid. BLAME BISHOP ducked out at the start forcing MISTER MISTER into the path of STERLING JUDGE, was urged along the inside
pursuing the pacesetter into the turn and faded along the rail in the drive. MISTER MISTER, brushed at the start while forced into the path of STERLING
JUDGE, was settled near the inside racing to the turn and failed to menace. STERLING JUDGE, bumped, then shuffled back at the start, never regained
contention. COOL HAND LUTE broke slowly while being pinched back at the start and proved no threat. REKKER broke inwards bumping COOL HAND
LUTE, was held up off that foe and soon dropped out last.

Footnotes
PALLAS ATHENE broke in the air losing position to the field, was reserved last to the first turn, switched outside foes gaining position between rivals after a
half, was prompted to split foes on the far turn advancing to contention, angled to the rail nearing midstretch to advance in close quarters but continued with
a sustained effort to wrest a narrow advantage in time under strong handling. MARNIE GIRL pulled her way to the lead racing to the first turn while a bit off
the rail, set the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, was prompted to resist a rival's challenge racing in the two path through the far turn to
upper stretch while losing some ground near midstretch, shifted inwards despite left handed pressure nearing the wire but contested the issue gamely
between foes to the end to just miss. CAPOEIRA tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, advanced on the leaders four wide
racing into the far turn and continued willingly in that path to close the gap to the end while outkicked by the top pair. HUNGRY KITTEN settled last racing
into the backstretch, angled out five wide entering upper stretch and made some belated progress. WAR ROSE angled to the rail in early stages stalking
just off the pacesetter in the opening half, came through inside that rival to press the issue on the far turn to upper stretch gaining a narrow advantage, was
caught in close quarters leaving midstretch while failing to sustain her momentum and was held up avoiding tight quarters nearing the wire. VENETIAN
PRINCESS angled inwards in early stages to track off the second flight under light rating, saved ground on the far turn briefly gaining some position but
faded racing into the lane. BLONDE MOMENT, restless in the gate, tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight to the far turn and emptied out
between foes nearing the lane. PUBLICIST tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight to the backstretch but was through after a half
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN..

Footnotes
ROUGH NIGHT angled inwards in the opening stages attending a rival's pace under light rating to the backstretch, pressed the issue entering the far turn,
edged forward nearing upper stretch, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch but kicked clear under firm encouragement. QUALITY STEP tracked
off the second flight in the opening half, shifted out four wide advancing on the leaders through the far turn, was fanned five wide while gaining striking
distance midstretch but couldn't gain terms with the winner. HONEST TO GOODNESS, reserved outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch,
angled to the rail entering the far turn steadily gaining momentum, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and gained position between foes to the end. TOSS
tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight while caught a bit wide to the backstretch, was prompted to advance challenging for command three deep
between foes nearing upper stretch but weakened in the closing stages. JIMMY D, reserved between foes in the last flight early, angled six wide racing into
upper stretch and made some mild progress late. ASTUTE WARRIOR tracked the leaders between foes just off the second flight, split rivals just off the
inside to lodge a brief bid inside the pacesetter racing into upper stretch but proved empty late. DOLLAR BLUE tracked off the second flight while working
his way to the inside on the backstretch, angled outside foes on the far turn to race five wide into the lane but had no rally. CROWN TO THE GOLD settled
near the inside racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. COMPLETELY BONKERS angled to the inside stalking just off the pacesetter, saved ground
through the far turn briefly awaiting an opening but faded nearing upper stretch. CLASSY INDIVIDUAL settled between foes dropping off the second flight to
the backstretch, angled to the rail after a half but offered no rally. RED HOT LOOKS moved to the lead on his own courage racing a bit off the rail to the first
turn, dueled for command inside the eventual winner into the far turn and gave way into the lane. TACTICAL QUALITY dropped out early.
