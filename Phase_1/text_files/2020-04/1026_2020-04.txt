Footnotes
TESSIE'S RED SOX broke sharply to set the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail, angled to the inside entering the turn, then kicked clear
through the stretch under firm left handed encouragement. PINK PEPPERMINT, bumped from both sides, then squeezed back at the start, pulled her way
to contention between foes to briefly loom outside the winner nearing upper stretch but proved empty in the drive while narrowly prevailing for the place
honors. MERENGUE, urged to a forward placing along the rail, tracked the leaders along the inside to the lane and continued with interest nearest the rail
while being just outkicked for second. TENERIFE MOON was settled along the rail in the opening quarter, switched outside foes racing into upper stretch
and continued with an effort to improve position. DISCRIMANATION was rated off the second flight racing five wide through the backstretch, angled inwards
on the turn to race between foes but had no closing bid. FLATOUT SCREAMING broke outwards bumping PINK PEPPERMINT several times, was
collected to track the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the turn but faded early. MARGIE'S ROUXBEE broke inwards bumping PINK
PEPPERMINT, was righted, then urged four, then three deep into the turn in pursuit of the leaders, gave way into the turn. LADY DENISSE dropped out
early.

Footnotes
FIRST DEGREE exchanged light contact with NOW I'M BROKE at the start, was righted to track off the first flight under light rating to the turn, was
prompted to advance while shifting out four wide racing through the turn and produced a sustained response in that path racing through the stretch to wrest
the advantage in time under firm handling. TEN MILES HIGH, forwardly placed three deep attending the pace in early stages, pressed the issue in that path
on the turn, went clear into upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. PRETTY BOY DAVE settled outside foes in early stages,
shifted out five wide racing into the lane and continued to improve position. TITHED, held up between foes in early stages, angled to the inside nearing the
turn and continued with an even effort inside rivals to late stages. SAISON made brief pursuit of the leaders between foes, dropped back early, angled to the
inside nearing the lane to regain some position but made no impact. VEGAS LIFE, urged between foes disputing the pace through the backstretch into the
turn, gave way after a half. OUR PRINCE was settled in hand dropping well back early, was fanned six wide into the lane but never gained contention. NOW
I'M BROKE broke out exchanging contact with the eventual winner, was briskly roused to prompt the pace inside foes racing into the turn, gave way nearing
the lane while drifting out brushing the eventual winner and quickly came up empty. HELLFIRE BOB broke slowly and never gained contention.

Footnotes
HARD N'SWEET, off a step behind the leaders, was prompted to gain a forward placing racing three deep into the backstretch, took over in that path racing
into the far turn, went well clear entering upper stretch under firm,hand urging and finished in hand nearing the wire. SORCIER tracked off the second flight
between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide on the far turn and continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others while never a
threat to the winner. MASTERIO threw his head at the start while breaking a bit slowly, was settled between foes into the backstretch, swung out four wide
racing through the far turn and continued to gain position while no menace to the top pair. BUMPA, urged to the lead from the break while angling to the
inside, set the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, dueled for command inside the eventual winner racing into the far turn and gave way. SECRET
MAGICIAN, held up avoiding close quarters in the opening stages, was prompted to advance nearing the far turn, shifted three wide nearing the lane and
gained some position while no real factor. DRAMA AN VICTORY, urged to prompt the pace between foes racing to the backstretch, gave way early. DEGAS
AWAY, a bit outpaced in early stages while under some prompting from his rider, was caught five wide racing through the first turn and failed to menace.
FRIO tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, was prompted to lodge a brief bid nearing the far turn but emptied out early. LORD BYRON tracked
the leaders inside rivals in second flight, came under prompting to advance along the inside after a half but emptied out early. OVERPOWER, off a step
slowly, was caught four wide tracking off the second flight to the backstretch and dropped out early.

Footnotes
LADY'S ISLAND came through tight quarters at the start to gain the advantage, was urged to set the pace on a clear margin shifting off the rail, dictated
terms on a comfortable advantage under some prompting racing in the three path into upper stretch and held sway through the lane on her own courage in
a ridden out effort. SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT bobbled slightly while caught in close at the break, was settled between foes in the last flight in the opening
quarter, was prompted to advance racing into the turn, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place
honors. STARSHIP REINA was rated just out of striking distance racing four, then three wide tracking the pacesetter racing into the turn, was prompted to
advance on that foe nearing upper stretch, shifted inwards under pressure racing through the lane and weakened late. CAUGHT UP IN YOU hopped at the
start, was settled out of close quarters outside foes, dropped out last racing into the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane and made some belated
progress to gain position while no threat. NIKKI BELLA broke in the air, then was checked out of tight quarters at the start, angled to the inside racing as
part of the last flight through the backstretch but never seriously menaced. RUSSIAN ROULETTE, urged inside rivals pursuing the pacesetter into the turn,
emptied out nearing upper stretch. J'S INDIAN CHARM exchaged bumps from both sides at the start, was urged through close quarters to pursue the
pacesetter between rivals in second flight racing into the bend but emptied out early.

Footnotes
QUEENS EMBRACE gained a position between rivals as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch under light rating, shifted out after a half while
being held up slightly racing three deep between foes, was prompted to advance in that path leaving the midway point of the far turn, steadied slightly
avoiding tight quarters while conceding some position to SUGAR FIX nearing upper stretch, then switched outside that foe and responded to firm handling
to wrest the advantage in time. The latter, pulling a bit inside rivals under rating racing as part of the second flight, was eased back slightly after a half,
swung outside foes entering the far turn to advance on the leaders four wide nearing upper stretch, moved to gain the advantage entering the lane while
shifting inwards but couldn't contain the winner's late bid. VOLADOR broke readily, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the
backstretch, conceded the lead after a half to track the leaders along the inside but steadily faded into the lane. TOOLCAT broke slowly, was urged to gain
terms prompting the pacesetter into the backstretch, took over after a half, set the pace on a narrow margin between foes into the far turn and gave out
entering upper stretch. TEMPTATION EYES tracked the leaders three deep in second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced in that path to bid between
rivals midway through the far turn but soon gave way.

Footnotes
BIG MONEY MACHINE, bumped from both sides then squeezed back at the start, was settled into stride along the rail, gained position inside foes when
presented an opening midway through the backstretch, advanced in tandem with several rivals racing into the far turn to bid inside the pacesetter entering
the second bend, disputed the issue on a narrow advantage through the bend to the stretch and just held MEILLEUR to the end in a prolonged drive. The
latter broke inwards bumping the eventual winner, was urged to gain the lead racing to the first turn while a bit off the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow
margin to the second bend, then disputed the issue once headed by the winner on the far turn in a protracted skirmish while shifting out in late stages but
proved only second best. WILSHIRE STAR tracked the pace off the second flight racing four wide to the backstretch, was prompted to split foes midway
through the far turn to advance three wide to upper stretch and prevailed for a share late. INDIAN GULCH broke outwards bumping the eventual winner,
was collected to track just off the leaders near the inside while pulling against restraint, shifted off the inside while being rated just off the first flight on the
backstretch, was prompted to advance in tandem with the eventual winner nearing the second bend, lost some momentum when caught in close quarters
leaving the seven sixteenths marker, shifted inwards on the far turn but lacked the needed closing response. INVASORS WIND, reserved between foes just
off the inside racing to the backstretch, angled inside foes entering the far turn and gained some position while no real threat. ALLEGIANCE, urged to terms
between foes prompting the pacesetter into the first turn, attended the pace while being floated out three wide nearing the second bend and soon gave way.
K P CREED, hesitated at the start losing position to the field, was prompted to gain some position shifting out five wide on the backstretch, made brief
progress in that path after a half but quickly came up empty. BROWNS GAP tracked the leaders three deep racing into the first turn, continued outside foes
in second flight on the backstretch, was prompted to lodge a brief bid while caught four wide between foes nearing the far turn and soon emptied out.
OLLIVANDER was rated tracking the leaders between foes behind the second flight racing to the backstretch and emptied out early.

Footnotes
FIRST COURSE, reserved avoiding close quarters along the inside racing to the first turn, switched out on the backstretch, was prompted to split rivals
three deep racing into the far turn commencing her advance and produced a sustained response to reel in EVER SMART in time to go clear at the wire
under firm left handed encouragement. The latter sprinted clear of her rivals while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, held sway on a comfortable
margin racing a bit off the rail to the second bend, was roused to resist the winner's challenge through the stretch but couldn't fend off that rival. PRINCESS
PAO broke slowly, was settled between foes tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, then steadily gained position into the lane to prevail for a
share. ENOUGH KISSES, urged to gain a forward placing three deep tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, steadily faded racing into the far
turn. BETTERTHENYOURX tracked the leaders outside rivals just off the second flight in the opening stages, was caught four wide racing into the far turn
and offered no rally. DYNAPOWER settled along the rail racing to the backstretch tracking off the second flight, switched outside foes nearing the lane but
never proved a serious threat. DIVINE MARTHA broke through the gate before the start, angled inwards tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the
backstretch, was urged to make a brief bid between foes nearing the far turn but quickly came up empty.

BAHAMA PEARL broke sharply, sped to the lead along the inside, held sway on a widening margin into upper stretch and was kept to the task.
BILLYSBIRTHDAYGIRL was hustled from the break pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, couldn't gain even terms with that foe, then weakened in the drive
while just lasting for the place honors. BELLEINTHECITY tracked off the pacesetter inside foes early, shifted out three wide turn on the turn while being
prompted to advance and continued in that path with an even effort to prevail for a share. RACHEL'S WISH was settled between foes racing to the turn,
angled inside entering the stretch and made an effort to improve position. BAND SWEETHEART was rated outside foes in the opening stages, was caught
four wide racing into the turn while making progress but faded while drifting out in the stretch. WEE MS. BURNZIE was off slowly and never menaced.
RANK AND FILE tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, angled to the rail on the turn and soon retreated. RIDGELYSREDHOT, held up avoiding
close quarters at the start, settled in the last flight and soon trailed.
