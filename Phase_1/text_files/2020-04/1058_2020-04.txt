Footnotes
ROYAL SOPRANO showed good speed from the inside and held gamely to be clear under strong encouragement. HOBBS HOPE stalked the early pace,
moved up four wide into the lane and finished second best. SARAH ELISE stalked the pace, raced two wide and kept on to the wire. EURO STEP was
allowed to settle early, raced in tight quarters approaching the eighth pole, shifted to the inside and never was a factor. SUGARSHAKING was off a step
slow, raced three deep through the stretch and never threatened. ANWARA vied for the early lead and gave way.

RARE POPPY stalked the pace, moved up four wide in the lane and finished well to get up under all out pressure. DIAMOND LEGACY was allowed to
settle early, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and finished second best. FRUGAL BETTY tracked the leader while racing two wide, led into the stretch
and weakened a bit in the final stages. CHECKERBOARD stalked the pace, saved ground and had no final winning bid. PRICILLA KAY was slow early,
raced along the inside through the far turn into the stretch and never was a factor. LUCIA GAL settled off the early going, raced six deep into the lane and
never was a factor. HAVINGAFIT stalked the pace and tired. FLASHFLOOD WARNING showed good speed and gave way.

FOXRUN set all the pace from the inside, dug in nearing the sixteenth pole and held gamely to prevail under strong encouragement. SPENDAHOLIC
pressed the pace, raced just off the inside throughout, led briefly in the stretch and finished second best. ICE SPHERE stalked the early pace, raced three
wide in the lane and kept on willingly to the wire. TREBULSKI settled off the early pace, raced four deep at the eighth pole and had not enough late. THE
DEVIL'S DADDY dropped back early, raced three deep and had no response. TOTALLY TIGER was slow early and never threatened. MEGA DA VIRADA
was unhurried early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. POLICE CHIEF stalked the pace along the inside and tired. ALLLUVIAL
