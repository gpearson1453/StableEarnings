Footnotes
MY BOY LENNY broke sharply to gain a clear advantage, dictated the pace racing in the two path into the bend and held sway on a comfortable margin
throughout under some left handed pressure and firm hand urging. HIDE THE DEMON ducked out at the start brushing DEVILEYE, was righted to track just
off the pacesetter inside rivals racing into the turn, shifted out entering upper stretch but proved only second best. DEVILEYE, caught in close quarters just
after the start, was taken in hand while angling inwards to track just off the second flight, saved ground into the lane and continued with an effort to gain
some position while earning a share. OVER ICCE settled last outside foes in early stages, swung out four wide racing into the stretch and gained some
position while making no real impression. DIAMOND DUST, caught in tight quarters just after the start, was urged to gain a position between foes in the
second flight racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing upper stretch. ROL AGAIN QUESTION was urged to terms with the second flight racing three
deep through the backstretch into the bend and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
HALEL, restless in the gate, broke in the air, then was bumped while dropping out last racing to the first turn, continued unhurried into the backstretch, was
prompted to advance after a half gaining position between foes, gained terms with the first flight splitting rivals three deep racing through the far turn, forged
clear racing into upper stretch while shifting to the inside and held sway to the end under pressure. TRINNI ALEX shied inwards at the break bumping the
eventual winner, recovered while gaining position between foes shifting out four wide racing into the first turn, was rated into the backstretch, then was
prompted to advance four wide racing into the far turn, shifted inwards racing into upper stretch but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors
late. WHEELBARRELBROTHRS sped to the lead while angling inwards, dictated the pace near the inside on a narrow margin through the backstretch,
dueled for command inside foes racing through the far turn and gave way into the stretch. JORDANS WAY ducked in slightly at the start, then was caught
wide racing to the first turn, was guided nearer to the inside gaining position between foes racing into the backstretch, advanced on the leaders three deep
to challenge nearing the far turn, was fanned four wide on the second bend and steadily faded nearing the lane. SWIFT KID, pulled his way between foes to
gain a position in the second flight racing to the first turn, readily advanced on the pacesetter after a half to press the issue between foes entering the far
turn but gave way nearing upper stretch. TRAP angled inwards tracking the leaders in second flight in the opening stages, continued just off the first flight to
the second bend and steadily faded leaving the far turn. DRILL BIT was settled off the second flight saving ground to the backstretch but failed to mount a
serious challenge. FULL MOON RISING made brief pursuit of the pacesetter three wide between rivals to the backstretch and emptied out after a half.

Footnotes
NORTHERN, urged along from the outset pursuing the pacesetter racing into the turn, moved to terms with that foe leaving midstretch and took over late
while being kept to firm encouragement. DAD'S YANKEES sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside, held sway on a clear margin to upper stretch but
faltered nearing the sixteenth marker. PERFETTO, restless in the gate, tracked the leaders between rivals in second flight through the backstretch, dropped
back from that position entering the turn, shifted inside foes entering the lane and continued with a solid second effort to edge rivals for a share on the wire.
KARMA KING, restless in the gate, tracked the leaders five wide as part of the second flight racing into the turn, conceded some position on the bend then
shifted out entering the stretch continuing with a steady effort to close the gap while being just outnodded for a share on the wire. MR. KISSES tracked just
off the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight racing into the turn, shifted off the inside entering upper stretch and lacked the needed final kick. HEY
JABBER JAW hopped at the start losing position to the leaders, was urged to gain contention racing just off the second flight in the opening stages, was
fanned six wide racing into the stretch and finished evenly. JOSIE'S RIDDLE broke slowly and passed only tiring rivals. MULLED WINE, slow to gather
stride, failed to seriously menace. DOC KANE was settled well off the pace early, angled to the rail entering the turn but failed to threaten. SMOKY BLUES
tracked the leaders four wide between foes racing into the turn and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
BURKEY'S BABE broke sharply to gain the advantage, dictated the pace on a narrow margin just off the inside racing into the turn, shifted out entering
upper stretch but held sway to the end under right handed pressure. KUPURI came through close quarters at the break to track off the second flight along
the inside racing into the bend, angled out nearing upper stretch, shifted to the five path entering the lane and continued with a steady late response to edge
a rival for the place honors. CELESTIAL ORB, caught in tight quarters at the start, was urged along to regain contention inside foes racing through the
backstretch, shifted out four wide midway through the turn making steady progress, loomed briefly outside the winner in that path racing into upper stretch
but flattened out late. ADONAI BLESS angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter as part of the second flight, was prompted to bid inside the leader
racing into the stretch but weakened in the drive. TAKIN IT EASY angled in sharply in the opening stages to track the pacesetter between foes in second
flight then continued evenly through late stages. THIRTY NINE SEVEN was settled off the second flight between rivals in the opening stages, angled five,
then six wide entering the lane and made an effort to gain position. U KNOW I B LION hopped at the start while being shuffled back to last early, angled to
the inside racing into the turn to gain some position but made no real impact. JIMA'S GOLD angled in early to track the pacesetter three deep as part of the
second flight racing to the turn but gave way after a half. TAKEANOTHERCHANCE settled between foes in early stages and never seriously menaced.
FIRST HOOSIER forced wide by SONOMA STORM racing through the opening quarter, proved no threat. SONOMA STORM veered out impeding rivals in
early stages and gave way abruptly racing into the bend. CONGRATS GOLDA broke in the air losing position to the field, was caught widest avoiding
SONOMA STORM on the backstretch and never proved a factor.

Footnotes
TOTAL TAP was prompted to gain position between foes racing into the first turn to track just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, angled inside tracking
those rivals to the second bend, was prompted to challenge for command along the rail entering the far turn, disputed the issue in a prolonged drive while
shifting out brushing MY COWBOY entering upper stretch but gained a narrow advantage and maintained that margin to the end under firm right handed
pressure. The latter sped to the fore racing just off the rail into the backstretch, set the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled for command
between foes in an extended skirmish into upper stretch while being brushed then carried out slightly in late stages, but contested the issue to the end while
prevailing narrowly for second. TY RAN A HOMER, off a step slowly, was urged four deep between foes into the first turn to gain a position just outside the
first flight, was prompted to challenge in that path racing into the far turn, disputed the issue three deep into the stretch but was outkicked by the top pair.
MR WRENCH IT, caught five wide racing through the first turn to the backstretch, tracked off the second flight to the far turn, was urged to advance four
wide into upper stretch and continued to make mild progress to the end. WHISTLE ME HOME tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the
backstretch, switched outside foes racing into the far turn and made an effort to gain some position while no real threat. RUDIGER was settled outside foes
dropping off the second flight, angled inwards nearing the far turn but offered no rally. ENDURING HONOR settled between foes racing to the backstretch
and proved no threat. PURE LUCK, unhurried early dropping well off the pace, switched out entering the backstretch to race three deep between foes but
proved no threat. FOX ROX was urged to gain terms prompting the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue three deep between foes into the
far turn and emptied out midway through the bend. BOLD RESPONSE dropped out early.

Footnotes
FIELD LETTERS broke slowly, switched out in the opening furlong gathering stride, made steady progress racing five, then six wide nearing upper stretch,
shifted inwards under pressure late but took over in time under firm handling. SOLD ON SALSA, urged to dispute the lead from the outset racing a bit off the
rail, dispatched a rival to gain a clear advantage racing into upper stretch but was collared late. WOWEE tracked just off the leaders along the inside in the
opening stages, swung out four wide crossing the paths of several rivals racing into the turn, moved to challenge in that path entering the lane but was
outkicked. C. A. C. CHAQUIRA ducked out at the start bumping GIFTED PATH, was righted to track between foes off the second flight, shifted five wide in
the lane while advancing in traffic midstretch, then shifted six wide late to gain some position. MONJA tracked off the second flight between rivals racing to
the turn, was steadied avoiding WOWEE entering the turn, shifted out to race three deep between foes into the lane while finishing evenly. RETURN THE
FAVOR tracked off the second flight four wide between foes racing into the lane and continued evenly late. THEY CALL ME LUCKY veered out sharply at
the start, raced wide to the stretch and altered course leaving midstretch avoiding some traffic. SPICED RUM PUNCH tracked off the second flight inside
foes in early stages and faded into the turn. PREMIER JUSTICE, forced out by GIFTED PATH at the start, never menaced thereafter. STERLING QUEEN,
urged to gain a forward placing three wide tracking just off the leaders, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch and quickly emptied out. GIFTED PATH,
bumped, then carried out into PREMIER JUSTICE at the start, was collected off that foe and never proved a factor. MISS MARGARET ANN was urged to
terms forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the bend and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
MAROON MANIAC broke sharply, sped to the lead just off the rail racing to the backstretch, dictated terms on a comfortable advantage into the second
bend and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. KENTUCKY GHOST gained a forward placing tracking just outside the pacesetter leading the
second flight on a narrow margin into the backstretch, continued with a steady bid nearing upper stretch, shifted to the inside under pressure in the closing
stages and couldn't gain terms with the winner. LIGHT CRUISER tracked the leaders three deep as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance in that path nearing the lane and continued evenly through the stretch. SAFE AND SOUND tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part
of the flight just off the rail racing to the far turn and faded into upper stretch. FORTYEIGHTSTRAIGHT switched out four wide racing into the first turn while
being rated off the second flight, continued in that path throughout but offered no rally. PAPA'S PLACE, off last, angled to the inside racing behind the
second flight and failed to mount a serious challenge. HEY SACH tracked the leader between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch and emptied out
entering the far turn.

MY GIRL ANNIE, bumped, then held up avoiding tight quarters just after the start, angled to the inside racing through the backstretch tracking just off the
first flight, came through along the rail entering the turn to challenge for command, edged forward to a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, shifted off
the inside and went clear under right handed encouragement. ITSHERLUCKYDAY, caught six wide in the opening stages tracking off the first flight, steadily
advanced on those rivals racing four wide into the turn, gained second while being roused to challenge the winner in upper stretch but proved only second
best. G Q GIRL was rated just off the first flight between rivals in the opening quarter, was prompted to advance three deep between rivals entering the
bend to challenge for command midway through the turn but flattened out racing into the lane. UNCOMMON FACTOR ducked out at the start bumping the
eventual winner, was urged to dispute the pace inside foes while shifting off the rail racing through the backstretch, dueled for command between rivals
through the turn and gave way racing into the lane. DREAMING DIAMONDS flashed brief pace three deep between foes prompting the leaders in the
opening quarter but emptied out early. LENA HORNE made brief pursuit of the leaders five deep between foes in early stages but soon dropped out.
SWEET DADDIO, urged between foes prompting the pace for three furlongs, gave way into the turn.

Footnotes
HERE COMES JACKIE, off a step slowly, was rated three deep between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that
path racing into the far turn, then continued with a steady effort between foes into the stretch to just edge LADY BREXIT in time under firm left handed
encouragement. The latter sped to the lead racing to the first turn, set the pace on a narrow margin racing just off the rail to the backstretch, lost the
advantage to a rival racing into the far turn, produced a solid second effort to regain the advantage inside foes racing into upper stretch but couldn't quite
fend off the winner. FEISTY CHI CHI tracked the leaders between foes in second flight under light rating in the opening half, swung out four wide on the far
turn while being urged to advance on the leaders, moved to challenge in that path entering the lane but had no final kick. CLASSY LYNN, in touch with the
leader attending that's rival's pace in the opening half, took over racing into the far turn, went clear while shifting well off the inside nearing the lane and
faltered in upper stretch. PURO BLANCO tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, then faded between foes
entering the far turn. CHA CHA HEELS switched out five wide midway through the first turn while tracking just off the second flight but never gained striking
distance. KARSAVINA dropped out early. MS. AMETHYST, caught four wide between foes racing through the first turn to the backstretch, emptied out
early. SUNDRENCHED broke awkwardly, tracked just off the second flight along the inside, was prompted to advance along the rail nearing the far turn but
quickly came up empty.
