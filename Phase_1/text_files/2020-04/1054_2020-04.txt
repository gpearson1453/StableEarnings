ROAD SHOW bumped with rivals at the start but quickly showed in front to make the running about the three or four path, opened the lead in the turn then
held safe under steady handling in the lane. ALONEATTHEBAR bumped with rivals at the start, angled out through the turn to move four and five wide into
the lane and slowly closed but could not reach the winner. FEELS RIGHT was bumped between rivals at the start, saved ground and lacked a closing run.
MUZZ'EM chased the winner four wide and weakened. AUNT GAYLE weakened from three wide.

leaders through the final sixteenth to be going clear. OLLIE'S PAPA'S BOY was on the pace out from the rail inside THREE FOOTER then could not contain
the winner's late run while saving the place late. THUNDER BOX stalked the pace from three or four wide and offered up a mild late bid gain third. THREE

steady hand urging the remainder. SUPER MISS B HAVEN chased the winner from two or three wide and held clear for the place in the lane. WITTS
MAMBO JACK angled four wide in the far turn while moving up but could not close on the top pair late. CLYTEE saved ground and improved position while
no threat to the top ones. JUSTICE JEAN chased the winner from three wide to the far turn and weakened. ITYBITYQUIKASAKITY followed the pace three
or four wide and weakened. ROXANNA LYNN was void of any early speed to drop well back and passed beaten ones while angling four wide into the lane.

ground in the first turn then was green and raced an erratic course up the backstretch and gave way.

EMMAS SILVER ROSE was not along in gaining a clear lead, continued out from the rail through the turn and was under mild urging to hold a safe margin
through the lane. MUCHO SUPER GIRL chased the winner from along the inside then saved the place late. WITTS'S GATO rallied four wide into the lane
and just missed the place late. CHACE B A LADY chased the pace three wide and weakened. JUST AUDACIOUS went four and five wide through the turn
and never threatened. SISTERS HEART was not a factor three to four wide.

Footnotes
FRIGID was just off the leaders two or three wide early, settled back and moved out going to the far turn, responded through the lane and collared RANBIR
deep stretch to be moving clear. RANBIR gained a short clear lead about the two or three path, shook off a bid into the far turn to kick clear again then could
not contain the winner's late run. LEGENDARY SONG settled off the pace three wide, angled in through the far turn to save ground then continued on
narrowly gain third late. ALEXANDRIAS THRONE tracked the early pace inside, bid going to the far turn and could not sustain the run. CHAMBER DOORS
stalked the leaders three or four wide to make a mild bid going to the final turn but lacked a final closing run. SHIVERHERTIMBERS stalked the pace from
four wide and weakened.

POSSIBLY IN LOVE moved to the front and gained inside position early, made all the pace and held safe in the lane under steady handling. LOST KEY
stalked the pace outside to bid four wide into the far turn and get nearest the winner but could not close the gap in the drive. JUDGE ON THE RUN tracked
the pace from along the inside and lacked a final closing bid. MINE FOR A SONG moved up three and four wide but could not threaten in the lane. MS
ZIBBY angled out heading up the backstretch and improved position but was not a threat. UBETCHA IMA BUMPER tracked the early pace three wide and
tired. HOLD FAST KAT saved ground and was not a factor. JAMACIAN ME MONEY was always back racing three wide. JOY FOREVER stumbled at the
break, recovered to stalk the pace four wide and tired.
