Footnotes
SOUTH HOUSE angled inwards in the opening stages while being urged to prompt a rival's pace racing through the backstretch, edged forward nearing
upper stretch, then was roused left handed to kick clear from BLAZING MISS JOJO leaving midstretch to prove best. The latter broke sharply, was rated
tracking off the first flight racing three wide into the turn, advanced to challenge in that path in upper stretch, lugged inwards under pressure while failing to
maintain terms with the winner and finished in hand while proving best of the others. BODACIOUS BLEND switched well to the outside in early stages
racing as part of the last flight, was prompted to advance racing five wide into the bend and continued in that path to late stages while finishing well enough
to gain a share. GLOBAL QUEEN COCO tracked off the second flight racing four wide into the turn, but lacked a closing bid. ASTERS D'ORO, urged inside
the eventual winner dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing to the turn, continued in pursuit through the bend but gave way in upper stretch. GOLD
COUNTRY tracked just off the leaders between foes as part of the second flight racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. FAST FASHION
settled off the second flight racing between foes to the turn but offered no rally. INDY FRONT showed little. ONE LUCK GIRL proved no factor. MARIA'S
MIRAGE tracked just off the leaders inside foes in second flight racing to the turn and gave way abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
ANDREA'S WORRY broke readily, was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the turn to gain a narrow advantage between calls, met the
challenge of CAJUN DELIGHT nearing upper stretch to duel with that rival into the lane and gamely prevailed under left handed encouragement. The latter
broke slowly, was hustled between foes to gain a position just off the first flight racing into the turn, split foes midway through the bend to bid for command
inside the eventual winner striking the front with a quarter mile to go, then grudgingly disputed the issue to the end but couldn't match the winner's final kick.
SPEED SALSA broke in the air while getting away a bit slowly, tracked off the second flight five wide in early stages, angled inwards racing into the turn to
split foes nearing upper stretch, then continued evenly three deep in late stages while prevailing for a share. SNIPER SIS angled to the inside in early
stages dropping well off the leaders, saved ground on the turn, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and continued with interest to improve
position. ASTROMELIA settled into stride racing off the inside dropping well back early, but shifted five wide nearing the lane and improved her position in
late stages. BOW MAKER, held up avoiding close quarters just after the start, settled along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out entering the lane but
passed only tiring rivals. DRILL'S VALENTINE, urged inside prompting the eventual winner's pace racing to the turn, gave way nearing the lane. MADAME
ROUGE tracked off the first flight three wide racing into the turn and steadily faded nearing upper stretch. LA WAPA tracked the pace between foes in
second flight but dropped out early. AMBER PRINCESS trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TOUGH TICKETS shied inwards at the start making light contact with WHAT ELSE IS NEW, was righted to track the leaders three deep between foes in the
opening quarter, was prompted to close the gap on the leader while angling to the rail racing into the turn, shifted out in upper stretch, then continued with a
steady late response to wrest the advantage leaving the sixteenth marker and hold sway to the end under firm left handed encouragement. OH STEVE,
outpaced in early stages dropping well off the field, angled to the inside on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, gathered momentum racing into upper
stretch, then split rivals just off the inside while going well late to close the gap just inside the winner nearing the wire. HARRYKEEPTHECHANGE ducked
inwards at the start crossing into the path of the eventual winner, was urged clear dictating the pace just off the inside racing into the turn, held sway past
midstretch but yielded to the top pair late. IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK tracked the pacesetter four wide as part of the second flight in the opening quarter, was
prompted in pursuit of the leader in that path racing into the turn but gave way racing into upper stretch. WHAT ELSE IS NEW, brushed at the start, tracked
the leaders between foes racing into the turn but had no closing bid. MONITOR MILLS, urged to a forward placing three wide between foes pursuing the
pacesetter into the turn, emptied out early. DREAM ASTRAY tracked the leaders along the inside in the opening stages, dropped back while shifting out four
wide nearing the lane and proved no threat.

Footnotes
SILENT JET, urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, set the pace on a comfortable advantage into the backstretch, turned back
a rival's challenge racing into the far turn and held sway to the end under firm right handed pressure. DILLON ROCKS angled to the inside tracking just off
the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and continued in pursuit of the winner while proving best of
the others. BLACKLINE settled along the inside as part of the last flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest
to prevail for a share in late stages. D'CRAZINESS angled inwards racing through the chute cutting off TY RAN A HOMER in the opening stages, tracked off
the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out racing into the far turn splitting rivals, was roused to advance three wide into upper stretch
but had no late kick. FADE AWAY tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and
continued evenly. BOURBON TAN tracked off the second flight outside foes, was prompted to make brief progress three wide after a half pursuing the
pacesetter but faded between foes into upper stretch. TY RAN A HOMER, caught in tight quarters and forced to steady racing through the chute, settled
between foes just off the inside racing to the backstretch but never gained contention. BACANO settled last racing to the backstretch and never gained
contention. WELD, urged to a forward placing just outside the pacesetter racing to the first turn, tracked that rival through the backstretch, was prompted to
lodge a brief bid entering the far turn but gave way abruptly racing into the lane. ED'S DOG, caught three, then four wide racing to the backstretch, retreated
early.

UNBRIDLED HONOR shifted to the inside racing to the first turn taking up a position behind the second flight, continued along the inside into the far turn,
shifted a bit off the rail awaiting an opening racing into upper stretch, split foes just off the inside then bid for command approaching the sixteenth marker
and edged forward in time under energetic handling. SEMINOLE BEACH angled inwards racing to the first turn to prompt the pace outside a rival, pressed
the issue on the far turn edging forward to a narrow advantage, dueled between foes in a grudging effort past midstretch but couldn't contain the winner.
SUMMER SILENCE tracked just off the leaders along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out splitting foes three deep nearing upper stretch to bid
for command in that path entering the stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. COMMANDEER tracked just off the second flight outside foes under light
rating racing to the backstretch, angled out five wide in upper stretch while being prompted to challenge for command in the lane but had no final kick. BIG
GEORGES KINGDM, urged to a forward placing three wide stalking just off the leaders into the backstretch, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch and
faded in late stages. NEW DAWN settled between foes dropping well off the leaders racing to the backstretch, angled six wide entering the stretch but had
no rally. SON OF THUNDER settled outside foes dropping well off the leaders to the backstretch, was fanned seven wide racing into upper stretch but
offered no rally. ADARA, caught four wide racing to the first turn, was eased off the third flight while angling to rail on the backstretch, continued along the
inside to the far turn, shifted out five wide nearing the lane but quickly came up empty. CORE CURRICULUM, urged disputing the pace inside foes from the
outset to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch. TEMPO RUBATO trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DUCHESS OF SUSSEX broke sharply, was urged to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside racing to the backstretch, maintained that
margin into the far turn, then kicked away through the stretch under firm hand urging and some right handed pressure. NICENO worked her way to the
inside dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn gathering momentum, shifted out to split foes three wide in
the closing stages and proved clearly best of the others. MARY'S FRANCE (FR) was settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground
through the far turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to edge rivals for a share. BEACH BAR tracked the pacesetter inside
rivals just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, gained some position inside foes racing into the far turn, continued in pursuit of the winner saving
ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. PECHANGA (IRE) settled along the inside in the last flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground
throughout and improved position inside foes with a belated response. FOXGLOVE settled inside foes racing to the first turn, switched out entering the
backstretch and continued evenly three deep between foes gaining some position late. BY THE BOOK angled inwards to track off the second flight racing to
the backstretch, shifted out three wide leaving the midway point of the far turn while being prompted to advance but faded in the drive. THREE QUARTER
TIME, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, was prompted to challenge nearing the lane but gave way in the
drive. STARSHIP GODDESS, reserved between foes racing to the backstretch, never seriously menaced. STORMY D settled outside foes in early stages
and never seriously menaced. PIONEEROF NEW YORK tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the first turn, was prompted to advance four
wide after a half but emptied out early. LEXOPHILIA, urged to a forward placing three wide tracking just off the pacesetter was spent after a half.

Footnotes
EAST WING, in touch with a rival prompting the pace in the opening stages, went clear racing into the turn while shifting to the three path nearing upper
stretch and held sway on a comfortable advantage under firm right handed encouragement. BEFORE YOU, forced out at the start, recovered to track off the
second flight racing four wide into the turn, advanced in that path entering the lane but couldn't gain terms with the winner while proving best of the others.
BALLET SCHOOL, restless in the gate, broke slowly, settled well off the field racing to the turn, swung five wide on the bend and steadily gathered
momentum to prevail for a share in late stages. CAUGHT LOOKING, reserved well off the field racing to the turn, came around foes nearing upper stretch
gaining position, then angled to the inside in the closing stages while being outkicked for a share. KAY'S PROJECT broke out bumping BEFORE YOU, was
righted to gain a forward placing three wide tracking just off the leaders, shifted inwards racing into the turn and faded in the drive. OPULENT WAYS,
forwardly placed four wide tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn, steadily faded into the stretch. LIL ANNIE ROSE was urged to the lead inside
racing through the backstretch but gave way once headed by the winner. GRAPEVINE tracked off the first flight along the inside racing through the
backstretch but emptied out early. RANSOMS REWARD, bumped at the start, angled to the inside early racing well off the second flight and proved no
threat. WILD STORY raced three wide between foes on the backstretch and faded early. THE DONNA broke outwards bumping RANSOMS REWARD at
the start and retreated early.

GET SMOKIN, forwardly placed along the rail in the opening stages attending a rival's pace, switched outside that foe on the backstretch conceding some
position after a half, readily advanced to press the issue racing into the far turn, took over to go well clear racing into upper stretch and maintained a safe
advantage to the end under firm encouragement. EONS worked his way to the inside in early stages while dropping off the second flight, saved ground into
the far turn steadily gaining position, then shifted out three wide racing into the stretch and continued with a steady bid to close the gap while prevailing for
the place honors. ADMISSION OFFICE, held up avoiding close quarters after the start, settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, gained some
position inside foes racing into the far turn, then angled out six wide nearing midstretch finishing willingly to gain terms with the top pair. TALK OR LISTEN
(IRE) settled between foes near the rear of the field while shifting out racing to the backstretch, gained some position between foes nearing the lane, then
shifted out four wide to improved position between foes to the end. GREYES CREEK, caught five wide racing through the chute, shifted inwards crossing
the path of ARMISTICE DAY nearing the first turn to track off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep on
the far turn lodging a brief bid but emptied out in the drive. FANCY LIQUOR, caught in close quarters three deep between foes leaving the chute, angled to
the inside racing into the first turn to track just off the leaders inside foes to the backstretch, tipped out racing into upper stretch while being prompted to
advance but had no closing bid. ATONE tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the far turn and steadily
faded between foes into the lane. DELAWARE (GB) settled three wide between foes racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. SOLE
VOLANTE, shuffled back avoiding tight quarters at the start, trailed the field to the stretch. PROVEN STRATEGIES, urged to the lead while angling to the
inside, dictated the pace to the far turn, briefly contested the winner's bid and gave way midstretch. ARMISTICE DAY, caught in tight quarters four deep
between foes leaving the chute, was held up off the second flight racing into the first turn and faded after a half. BY YOUR SIDE, held up outside foes
avoiding traffic leaving the chute, continued four wide into the backstretch and dropped back early.

CURLIN'S CATCH, reserved in the opening stages while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, tracked off the second flight through the backstretch,
was prompted to advance between foes nearing the far turn, angled to the rail on the second bend steadily gaining on the pacesetter, shifted out to split
foes challenging for command near the three sixteenths marker and went clear under firm left handed pressure. BE SNEAKY broke sharply, angled to the
inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, continued to dispute the issue inside a rival on the far turn, shifted out once headed by the
winner in upper stretch but continued grudgingly inside foes to prevail for the place honors. IL MALOCCHIO tracked the pacesetter three deep in second
flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance between foes in that path entering upper stretch and prevailed for a share. SPECIAL PRINCESS
was settled last racing to the backstretch while angling nearer to the inside, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch gathering late momentum and
continued to improve position to the end. FEELING MISCHIEF, forwardly placed between foes in the second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced on
the pacesetter to press the issue racing into the far turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and came up empty in the drive. ROLL UP MO MONEY
tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight, then steadily faded along the inside racing into the far turn. SCENIC OVERLOOK tracked off
the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch and dropped back early.

Footnotes
COUNTERPARTY RISK (IRE) broke readily, was taken under a rating hold while angling to the inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance
racing to the backstretch, came under pressure to advance on the far turn saving ground, came through to challenge for command when presented an
opening in upper stretch, quickly gained the advantage, then held NEW YORK GIRL (IRE) to the end on a safe margin under firm left handed pressure. The
latter raced in touch with the pacesetter stalking just off that rival racing to the backstretch, was urged to prompt that foe nearing upper stretch, was fanned
three wide racing into the lane while being roused to challenge for command but proved only second best. MARGARET'S JOY ducked outwards at the start
brushing NO MERCY PERCY, was reserved along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground into the far turn while gaining a position just inside the
eventual winner, shifted a bit off the rail while being prompted to advance between foes entering the lane and continued willingly inside foes to prevail for a
share. NO MERCY PERCY, brushed at the start, moved readily to the fore along the inside dictating the pace in hand on a narrow advantage to the
backstretch, was prompted to maintain that lead racing into the far turn, drifted out entering upper stretch and gave way in late stages. IRONY OF REALITY,
reserved outside foes racing to the backstretch, offered no rally. KELSEY'S CROSS was prompted to a position tracking just off the pacesetter racing three
wide to the far turn and gave way racing into the lane.

responded when prompted to challenge for command in that path leaving the midway point of the far turn, took over racing past the quarter mile marker,
shifted to the rail in upper stretch, held sway to the end under firm left handed pressure and was observed to have bled from the mouth when returning to be
unsaddled. NOVA RAGS raced four wide between foes into the backstretch tracking just off the second flight, angled inwards sharply racing into the far turn
to advance along the rail on the second bend, shifted outside the eventual winner racing into the stretch and continued to close the gap while edging a rival
for the place honors. HIDDEN STASH was rated off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to the backstretch, then into the far turn steadily
gaining position, shifted out four wide entering the lane but continued willingly to gain terms with the top pair nearing the wire. BOCA BOY broke sharply,
was urged to set the pace on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, briefly resisted the winner's bid while between foes racing
through the far turn but gave way nearing midstretch. KNOWN AGENDA settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide
nearing upper stretch and made belated progress. LUCKY LAW (IRE) angled to the inside racing to the first turn to track off the second flight between foes
just off the inside, then continued evenly in that path to late stages. JOE MAN JOE was settled inside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, shifted
out racing into upper stretch but passed only tiring rivals. RICOCHET, caught five wide between racing to the backstretch while prompted to a position just
off the second flight, was urged to lodge a brief, four wide bid racing into the far turn but emptied out racing into upper stretch. SMILEY SOBOTKA, urged to
a forward placing while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, faded after a half. LAST INVESTMENT, caught six wide racing to the backstretch, never
gained contention. MILLEAN settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. RUNWAY MAGIC, caught in
close quarters at the start, was collected to race behind the second flight three wide between foes racing to the backstretch but steadily faded into the lane.

Footnotes
AIN'T WASTING TIME, forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages prompting the pace, conceded some position racing into the turn, shifted out
three wide while being prompted to advance on the leaders, drifted out under left handed pressure while challenging for command between foes brushing
INDY RIDE but just held that foe under firm handling. The latter gained a forward placing along the rail prompting the leaders on the backstretch, dropped
back from that position racing into the turn, switched out four wide in upper stretch advancing to challenge, was brushed in late stages challenging for
command and was just outkicked. INDIAN BUZZ joined the pace four wide in the opening stages, angled inside the pacesetter to race along the rail on the
turn, bid inside that foe in upper stretch but weakened late. FIRST DEGREE, urged three wide between disputing the pace in the opening quarter, edged
forward to a clear advantage racing into the turn but faltered between rivals in late stages. SHAKEM N BREAKEM was settled last, then split foes three wide
racing into the lane to improve position to the end. FREE FLAYME tracked off the first flight while angling to the inside and faded into the stretch. POCO
CHARLIE settled between foes in the last flight early and proved no threat. LOGSDON hopped at the start, settled along the inside racing to the turn but
offered no rally. BLAME BISHOP, pinched back at the start, was caught five wide racing to the turn while being prompted to contend and steadily retreated
after a half. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF INDY RIDE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF AIN'T WASTING TIME FOR
INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH. THAT CLAIM WAS UPHELD BY THE STEWARDS AND AIN'T WASTING TIME WAS PLACED SECOND.
