RANGER MOLLY vied for the lead, setting fast fractions while maintaining a rail trip, battled back and forth with ISLAND LIFE in the stretch before
dead-heating with that rival. ISLAND LIFE stalked a quick pace from the two path, swung to the three path on the turn, closed with a rush to engage
RANGER MOLLY before dead-heating with that rival. TIL I FOUND YOU stalked a quick pace, angled out for the stretch drive and closed with a mild bid to
take third. STELLACZAR saved ground off of a quick pace, angled out to the two path for the stretch drive and was no threat late.

got outsprinted to the turn, swung out from the two path to the four path into the stretch and was closing well late. ALWAYS FOR MONEY attended the pace

the start, stalked the pace three wide to the stretch then was also outrun to mid stretch and lacked a late response. STEIN'S GIRL had no speed and was
not a factor. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL broke out and bumped with BIG AWARD, had no seed and was always outrun. WATCHFUL EYE attended the pace
early then pressed from the rail on the turn but was outrun into the stretch and gave way. TAMA'S ARCH ducked inward sharply leaving the chute and lost

COLAVITO broke alertly but had no speed, trailed to the second turn, was four wide to the stretch then swung widest for the drive and closed with a stout
run to win going away. OMPH pressed the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide to take over into the stretch, was clear in mid stretch then was tiring
but saved the place. DEALERS HAND was four or five wide on the first turn, settled to the second turn, rallied five wide to the stretch and finished willingly
but too late. PROOF OF JAZZ set the pace to the second turn, was overtaken and tired in the stretch. BEN WADE tracked the pace to the half, saved
ground to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. TIGER ON THE PROWL was also four or five wide to the backstretch, tracked the pace to the
second turn, raced four wide to the stretch then gave way.

BIG CHICK was allowed to settle toward the back of the back in the early stages while maintaining clear running room in the three path, slipped inside to the
rail at the head of the stretch and rallied to gamely prevail. CHIEFTESS AINE hustled to the lead to set moderate fractions, was two wide heading into the
stretch and was outfinished. WINNING APPEAL stalked the pace while travelling in the two path, pressured the leader moving into the far turn, went two
wide coming into the stretch and held on for third. HANDCUFFED settled mid pack while three wide, improved position on the far turn, and was outfinished
for third. FICTIONAL settled mid pack while saving ground, traveled along the rail heading into the stretch and was not a factor. ROCKA DOCKA NOLA
settled at the rear of the field while racing in the two path, improved position while heading onto the far turn, and had no rally. LA PERLITA NEGRA stalked
the early pace, lost position heading into the far turn and faded.
