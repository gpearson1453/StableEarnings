Footnotes
SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN broke out at the start bumping BARN QUEEN, raced forwardly placed just off the inside, advanced to take command five
furlongs from home, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, drew off under
a drive to prevail. ROSE E HOLIDAY brushed at the start by NISBET BEACH, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on well clear of the rest to be along second best. LIGHTFOOT
MISS three to four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. BARN QUEEN bumped at the
start by SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.
DAILY BRIEFING established the front early on four paths off the inside, got displaced from the front five furlongs from home, tucked to the two path through
the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and faltered. NISBET BEACH broke out at the start brushing ROSE E
HOLIDAY, chased just off the inside, was in a bit tight between foes and nudged half a mile from home, suffered an injury just outside the three-eighths pole
and fell heavily at that station, then was attended to by veterinarian and euthanized on track. There was a general Stewards' Inquiry into the incident on the
turn focusing on NISBET BEACH before the result stood and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
TUFF BIRD lightly hand urged at the time, emerged from a tight pack at the break with the advantage, got guided over to the inside route, showed the way
on what was for the most part a loosely-contested lead, began to noticeably extend it late on the bend, struck the three-sixteenths pole and was switched to
a light drive, was kept at it for the next furlong before being geared down late. EMPRESS LUCIANA tracked the winner from along the inside, tipped into the
two path at the head of the stretch, proved no match. SHANNON'S GIRL cut over to the rail after bobbling slightly at the start, took it until for nearly a half,
angled four wide for the drive, went on to secure the show. DAZZLING SPEED three wide onto the turn, got sent out into path six from upper to midstretch,
gave out. BIG AL'S GAL pursued the pace from path two in between rivals on the turn, swung out one wider entering the stretch, folded. ELITE SPEED
attained a prominent position, pressed the pace two to three wide before faltering.

DID I STUTTER coaxed from the gate, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from a
pair to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and inched away under a drive
drifting out safely clear late to the finish. BASTET three wide in aim of the leader down the backstretch latched on outside the top pair, advanced to prompt
the pace three wide through the turn, swung four wide for home on near even terms and was set down straightened away, dug in under a drive and was
rebuffed through the stretch while along for the place honors. CHEROKEE SONG coaxed from the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch and
then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. WICKED HAPPY
four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced through to the finish and was
outkicked. MALIBU ANTHEM prompted the pace just off the inside between foes coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun three wide into
upper stretch and weakened. YES YOUR HONOR chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the inside half a mile from
home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. ROMA CARPE four wide
in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, went three wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
CONTROL GROUP patiently kept watch on the front runners from the pocket, angled to the outside springing from the five-sixteenths marker, wound up in
the three path a furlong down the road, began to whittle away at the deficit, proved relentless to the end, grinding his way to victory in the final jump.
FLOWERS FOR LISA away well, remained forwardly placed after the start, argued for control from along the inside, initially with CASTAGNO, and then with
AIR ATTACK beginning from the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, was put to a ride spinning into the lane, finished off the run through the furlong
grounds with the eventual winner taking aim, remained determined only to get reeled in at the finish line. PARADE FIELD cut over to the rail, tracked the
pace from along it before slipping to the outside right around the five-sixteenths pole, swung out three to four wide under some encouragement turning into
the lane, remained pinned in its new path by an obstinate CREATIVE STYLE, forced to draft behind another a short distance up ahead, dove to the rail in
midstretch and then after scooting clear of a twosome, tipped back to the outside and into path two a sixteenth later, closed in late to be along for the place.
CREATIVE STYLE took up position in midpack, chased the pace two wide on the turn, got steered four wide entering the lane, mustered up a mild
response, missed out on third. AIR ATTACK forwardly placed three wide, tucked one path closer to the rail after assuming the role of primary pursuer at the
five-sixteenths pole, kept at the task for a furlong or so and gave way. CASTAGNO prompted the pace from path two until the five-sixteenths pole, shifted
into the three path at the head of the stretch and was allowed to retreat.

DRAMATIC TWIST chased just off the inside from the tail of the field early on, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, angled to the inside a furlong out and rallied up the rail to take command near the sixteenth marker,
then edged clear to the finish. WINDS OF CAPRI chased just off the inside from mid pack, grew a bit rank under restraint near the half mile pole, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly outside to secure the place honors. SUMMER BREW
stumbled at the start recovering outwards which forced LA VICTORIA to be briefly steadied, pressed the leader from the two path down the backstretch and
then between foes through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch in a bit tight between foes and was
nudged by HIP NUMBER ONE, got bumped by that rival when digging in inside the eighth pole, then kept on to procure the show honors. HIP NUMBER
ONE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from SUMMER BREW to the outside before being joined also by LA
VICTORIA three deep through the turn, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch nudging SUMMER BREW straightened away, dug in under
threat coming out slightly and bumping SUMMER BREW once more inside the eighth pole before being displaced by the top one a sixteenth out and
weakened in the late stages. LA VICTORIA got steadied at the start when SUMMER BREW recovered outwards from a stumble, advanced after the break
to settle three wide in aim of the top pair, advanced through the turn to apply pressure and was set down spinning five wide into upper stretch, dug in under
a drive prominent to the eighth pole, weakened in the late going. LOLLYGAG chased four then three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BUSTIN TIMBERLAKE forwardly placed along the inside route putting some pressure on early pace setter STEP TO THE BANK, was successfully eased
back as the first fraction was being finalized, tipped into the two path at the top of the turn and went on to press the issue once more, was moved out three
wide stepping onto the head of the stretch, exploded to the front when asked for run a few strides later, built up an imposing advantage then got geared
down for the majority of the last sixteenth. NOTORIOUS FLIRT sighted along the inside route by the turn, cut the corner into the lane, rallied well enough to
garner the place. LEAP TO GLORY kept watch on the pace while saving ground, was asked to pick it up at the five-sixteenths pole, swung out three wide
for the drive, got outkicked. FLEET WARRIOR took up the chase two to three wide on the turn, angled into path four in upper stretch, lacked the necessary
response. STEP TO THE BANK cut over to the inside at the half mile pole after contending for the top towards path two prior, was re-positioned in path two
when set down coming into the stretch, got overpowered by BUSTIN TIMBERLAKE soon afterwards then steadily backed away. NINTH HOUR two wide
onto the turn, got sent out five wide exiting it, never made his presence felt. MORGANTOWN recovered in short order after bobbling at the start, departed
the back from the three path, was ridden into path six coming up to three-sixteenths pole, venturing onward as the widest of all, gave way.

MY BOY TATE chased just off the inside from the tail of the compact field, tucked inside half a mile from home, remained patiently handled through the turn,
took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out at the three-sixteenths three to four paths set down for the drive, rallied to collar the top pair with seventy
yards to go and inched away to the finish to prevail. BIG ENGINE coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide, got set down spinning four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive threatening through the final furlong, ran on to secure the place honors. TRIBECCA hustled from the gate, dueled inside
of AMUNDSON shortly after the start and knocked heads through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole when joined by BIG ENGINE, took
the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from that rival having successfully shaken off AMUNDSON, but was caught seventy yards from the
finish by the top one, then got bested for the place honors in the last jumps. AMUNDSON brushed the off side stall at the start when breaking outwards,
came under coaxing and advanced to duel crossing to the two path with TRIBECCA to his inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three
wide into upper stretch and was shaken off, folded, and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
BIG BOY MO away without apparent mishap, got guided into the three path, sat perched within striking distance of the ongoing pace dispute, crept up to the
ones to catch from the five-sixteenths pole, settled in upper stretch and was given his cue, took over, despite lugging in midstretch, pilot countering this with
a strong grip on the right side, assumed a truer course with approximately a sixteenth remaining and edged further clear. MUCHO SUNSHINE cut over to
the rail approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, cut the corner into the stretch, altered course towards path three in midlane, rallied for the place.
THERISASTORMBREWIN put to a brisk hand ride to cement itself to the top, argued for command from along the inside, got set down for the drive, was
overhauled by the top one at the furlong grounds, weakened into the show slot. MR. FIDGET rode the rail, stepped into the stretch, made no late headway.
HALSTAAT pursued the pace two wide on the turn after bobbling at the start, got sent out into path six from upper to midstretch, failed to fire appreciably.
COOLBOY two wide onto the turn, got sent out into path four exiting it, lacked the necessary response. QUINTARELLI sparred for the lead from path two for
the opening half, gave way.
