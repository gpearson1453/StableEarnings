Footnotes
IAMTHEBESTTOO was hustled along to set a pressured pace inside, dug in when met at even terms nearest the rail approaching the head of the lane and
continued determinedly to edge out the game effort of CRYPTO FLAG, who pressured the pace from the three path, drew to even terms approaching the
top of the stretch and dug in gamely to the wire. WHISKEY TALKING gave chase, angled to the six path on the turn and passed rivals widest in an even
finish. DYLADDIE chased and raced in the three path of the turn, drifted outward approaching the head of the stretch and flattened stride the final furlong.
REAL APPEAL chased outside, rounded the turn about the four path, was carried out nearing the eighth pole and showed little further. JUBA'S LADY
angled toward the outside to give chase then weakened in the four path of the turn. PUNCH WINDSOR gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn then
weakened.

Footnotes
LONGSTORYLUCY settled back off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily progressed through the far turn, entered the
stretch about the three path, dug in for the lead later yards and inched away from SHERWOOD LADY, who was rated close about the three path the first
turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and continued in the three path of the far turn, was carried out entering the stretch, and while able to duel to a slim
brief lead inside the sixteenth pole, relented later yards. PRIME LIME rated a clear lead inside, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, raced at
the rail on the far turn, but drifted toward the head of the lane, gave up the lead mid-stretch and flattened stride the final sixteenth. COUNTRY MAGIC saved
ground off the early pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, then flattened stride the final sixteenth. LIKE ME OR NOT
rated close to the early pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded into the far turn. TIZ JOHNNIE was
pulled up lame shortly after the start and was trailered off.

in the later duel for second. FIRST LADY MAGGIE chased and raced off the rail most of the turn, drifted to the five path approaching the top of the stretch
and finished evenly. GOLD AND STRIKE broke a step slow and was jostled on the chute, raced well back from early contention, came through the turn
about the four path then passed rivals outside. NELLYSFORD chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn then weakened. COACH RUBE chased, rounded
the turn about the three path, was carried to the six path approaching the top of the stretch and showed little further. IRMA GIRL gave only distant chase
and saved ground on the turn.

Footnotes
TIZ THE REASON accelerated to the front toward the three eighths pole and angled in nearing the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the turn then dug in
under steady stretch encouragement to hold on well. GOT ANY chased inside and raced at the rail on the turn, but couldn't improve in the stretch and had to
settle for second best. IRISH KNOCKOUT chased the earlier pace inside, lost momentum at the heels of Tiz The Reason into the turn, altered course to the
three path midway on the turn then yielded second in the stretch duel. CASTLE REVIEW chased and raced in the three path of the turn then dug in down
the lane and finished well. PIPERS GOLD chased toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. NIGHT
FLIGHT was shuffled back on the chute and rounded the turn in the four and five paths. HOLY HOT LEGS gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path
and showed nothing more. MAGICIANS DIVA gave chase through the backstretch but was shut off and checked from the inside flank of Tiz The Reason
approaching the five sixteenths pole, recovered stride past the quarter, though, drifted toward the head of the lane and weakened. The Stewards reviewed
claims of foul against the rider of Tiz The Reason, lodged by the jockeys of Irish Knockout and Magicians Diva, though decided on taking no action.

Footnotes
YOUR EYES TO MINE settled close toward the inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and factored through the far turn, slipped through at the rail
leaving the eighth pole, drew clear and held on well. WIN THEN GRIN settled just off the pace and off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced
in range of the lead four wide on the far turn, then dueled through the final sixteenth to take second the closing yards. UNCUT stalked the earlier pace two
deep, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close three wide on the far turn, but was outfinished for second the final sixteenth.
YOUKNOWWHATITIZZZ saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn just off the rail, eased outward past the
eighth pole and passed the tiring NOBODY'S ANGEL, who rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole and held the
advantage near the rail on the far turn, but was caught inside the eighth pole and weakened. JEAN GREY saved ground early on then eased out into the
backstretch, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole then drifted to the five path and flattened stride from the mid point of the far turn.
DON'T FIGHT raced in the four path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole but was
carried to the seven path midway on the far turn. IRISH FIX stumbled leaving the gate, raced in the three path the first turn and never factored.

GOLDEN ANSWER stalked inside early and left the first turn three wide, closed to the lead approaching the five sixteenths and was asked into the far turn,
widened through the turn, was steadily handled to mid-stretch then taken in hand later yards. MALIBU CIRCLE angled to the inside to set the early pace,
was caught into the backstretch and gave chase from that point, raced at the rail on the far turn, took second inside the eighth pole and held on. GREY
INVASION rounded the first turn about the six path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in
the three path, dueled for third mid-stretch then flattened stride. BURN THE SHIPS stalked two deep the opening turn and took the lead into the backstretch,
was caught toward the five sixteenths pole and gave chase at the rail on the far turn, then weakened. MOSS BOSS saved ground off the pace the opening
turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole then flattened stride in the three and four paths of the far turn. POLITICAL DECISION saved ground
the opening turn and showed no response through the backstretch. JESS'S RESERVE raced off the pace about the four path the first turn, gave chase from
the nine sixteenths pole but faded past the five sixteenths. CHAINSAW AL rounded the first turn in the seven path, raced outside into the backstretch and
never factored.

Footnotes
PRIMAL DESTINY took over on the chute and set a clear pace, came under pressure midway on the turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold
well. LAUGHING CAT chased, raced off the rail on the turn and was no match in the lane. COMMAND THE CAT chased outside and raced in the four path
of the turn, dug in for third and was gaining on second. TAPTAPTAP chased off the rail, raced two deep through the turn, but drifted into the lane and
relented third. YOU GO BOY chased outside, rounded the turn in the five and six paths and passed some rivals in the lane. FLAT RATE gave chase,
rounded the turn in the three and four paths, was carried out toward the eighth pole and had little left. PETTINBERG chased outside, rounded the turn in the
seven path and raced widest into the lane. MAJESTIC SEAS gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn then weakened.

Footnotes
FREEDOM RIDER settled close toward the inside the first turn, rallied to the front approaching the three eighths pole and was pressured past the pole, drew
clear nearing the quarter and widened under steady stretch handling. PISTOL P stalked the early pace inside and moved to even terms midway on the
opening turn, took a slim lead between calls past the half mile pole but was caught approaching the three eighths pole and gave chase from that point,
dropped back toward the quarter pole and had to settle for second best. STRIDE ON BY settled off the pace in the three and four paths, started a bid
approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and was along for third inside the sixteenth pole. RETURN TO ME rounded the
opening turn about the four path and stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase at the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn still in the four
path then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. CHOCO ROCO stalked the earlier pace in the two and three paths, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths
pole, but flattened stride near the rail on the far turn. MADDEYE MOODY steadied early while well off the pace and raced off the rail the first turn, eased out
into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole but flattened stride about the four path of the far turn. CAYATANO saved ground off the pace the first
turn. JACKSON MAN rounded the opening turn about the four path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, gave way in the three path
of the far turn. LAST PARTY took the lead approaching the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to set the early pace, was met midway on the
opening turn, gave chase from that point but faded nearing the five sixteenths pole.
