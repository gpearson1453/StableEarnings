WISE RIVER RAY chased the pace to mid turn, rallied two wide to the stretch, got on terms with RIVER NORTH in mid stretch then outbattled PEQUENO
MONTE to the line. PEQUENO MONTE pressed the leader three wide to the stretch, responded when asked in the drive and just missed. RIVER NORTH
set the pace from the rail to the stretch, was collared by the winner in mid stretch and weakened late. NORTH CROSS tracked the pace to the turn, came
three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. COLLUSION DELUSION broke awkwardly and about three lengths last, trailed to the turn, was four
wide to the stretch but did not threaten. IDIOT IN LOVE was always outrun.

Footnotes
ASHLEY'S VALENTINE stalked the leader to the turn, was off the rail to the stretch then shifted out for room in upper stretch, rallied between rivals and
outkicked GALLANT GUY for the win. GALLANT GUY pressed the pace, got fanned four wide to the stretch then also rallied, battled the winner but was
bested late. EXCEED SPEED LIMIT set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then resisted to deep stretch before giving way to the
top two. MYSTIC TRAVELER broke slow and was outrun to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then shifted out and finished willingly. STORMIN
GALILEO hustled to prompt the pace three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. CHARMING VINTAGE had no speed, raced off
the rail to the stretch then shifted out for room and was showing some late interest. SILLY IMAGE got outsprinted early, was saving ground but had to
steady nearing the five sixteenths and did not rally. PROUD LION was chasing the leaders outside rivals and was five wide into the turn, eased down to the
three path to the stretch but gave way through the drive.

THIS IS THE ONE zipped to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then edged clear to mid stretch but was under steady urging to hold.
SHEZARUNAWAY was sent for speed, chased the winner from the rail then remained inside and closed willingly. SQUARE DREAMER got outsprinted to
the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then shifted out and was gaining late. CLEVER CHIEFTESS pressed the pace two wide to the stretch then got
outkicked by the winner and came up empty. VEGAS PALM had no speed, swung out four wide into the stretch and was also closing belatedly. ZAKAR was
outsprinted to the turn, shifted out to the four path into the stretch, came in and brushed KATIE'S PARADISE in mid stretch then finished evenly. KATIE'S
PARADISE stalked the winner three wide to the stretch then was being outrun, brushed with ZAKAR in mid stretch and weakened. SWEET AND SOFTLY
had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch but was never a threat. LAGATHA dwelt in the gate at the start, came out about twelve lengths last and was
not a factor.

Footnotes
IN OUR A was chasing early, rallied four wide to the stretch, got on terms in mid stretch then dug in gamely to prevail. TOM'S SURPRISE was outsprinted
early, made a bold run two wide on the turn, rallied to loom boldly in mid stretch but was outkicked for the win. STAR RACER tracked the pace to the turn,
was fanned four wide to the stretch and finished in a rally. SQUARE DEAL hustled to contest the pace, inched clear three wide, was collared in mid stretch
and tired. WINE AND WHISKY had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch then picked off rivals. EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER broke slow, had no speed, was
two wide on the turn and closed the gap in the final furlong. OUR BOLD PRINCE was outsprinted to the turn, raced four wide to the stretch then lacked a
closing response. OH JERRY flashed speed to the turn, was outkicked by SQUARE DEAL, pressed three wide then pushed up to engage for the lead again
nearing mid stretch but tired in the final furlong. LOAFERS BOY was also outrun to the turn, circled five wide to the stretch then had little to offer in the drive.
I AM ALLTHATYOUARE chased the leaders three wide to the stretch then gave way. RED'S SHOWTIME flashed speed to the turn then stopped.
