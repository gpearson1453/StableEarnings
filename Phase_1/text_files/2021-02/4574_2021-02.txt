Footnotes
OPTIMUS KAT close from the tart off the inside, in hand up the backstretch, took over in the up the backstretch, challenged through the second bend, drew
clear through the lane while kept to pressure. SUPER WISE away in good order, set the pace along the inside, briefly dueled inside the winner late in the
final turn, proved no match for that foe in the drive, narrowly saved the place. TANGO KILO void of speed for five furlongs,, swung four out to five wide
turning for home, gaining for the place while remaining well out in the strip. FLAT REWARD four wide into the first turn, crept closer in the three path far turn,
failed to sustain that advance in the drive. BEAUCETTE'S EKATI within striking distance in the second group while toward the inside, came up empty for the
drive. GAINER three wide when within striking distance into the first turn, continued in the second flight the middle half, failed to respond when called on for
the drive. NUGGET OF GRACE slight bother start, fell far back, failed to muster a rally. KICK SOME TALE squeezed back at the start, stopped after a half,
far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
GREELEY AND BEN in the second group off the inside, advanced on the leader in the two path when straightened for home, dueled past the furlong
marker, edged clear late. PADDY O'DINI void of speed, rallied three wide into the lane, finished willingly to be up for the place. EXULTING back off the pace
and the inside, raced in the second flight through the turn, went evenly in the drive to lack a late punch. KITCHEN FIRE broke alertly, cleared soon after,
continued to show the way through the turn by daylight, dueled briefly past the furlong marker inside the winner then faltered when headed by that rival.
OLSON settled off the pace along the inside, continued to save ground turn, lacked a significant closing response when called on while steadily steered out
to the far outside. MAY WE ALL forwardly placed along the inside, came up empty for the drive. WHITE WOLF one paced, four wide into the lane, had
nothing for the drive. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER last to leave, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
PARKIN IN THE REAR broke alertly, soon sprinted well clear, continued to hold a sizable advantage into the turn, was given a breather late in that bend,
responded when headed by the winner a furlong out, battled back and dug in late to prevail in game fashion. CREDIT ENHANCEMENT moved up the inside
to head up the second flight, advanced on the leader to challenge into the stretch, briefly put a head in front past the furlong marker, continued to duel to the
wire, outkicked in the late going. OVERDRESSED settled off the pace and the inside, asked along in the two path midway in the turn, came three wide for
the drive, getting to the top two late. ARTIE'S ROSE lacked early foot, three wide through the turn, staged a modest rally while remaining well off the inside
through the stretch to be also making headway on the top pair. GOLDEN GRANT raced back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat.
PERFECT IMPRESSION away in good order, chased the winner off the inside, three wide exiting the turn then gave way. HAPPYGOBUCKY was never
involved while saving ground. SHESHAPPY off a step slow, moved up to mid pack, tired in the drive while also racing along the inside.

Footnotes
DIGGIN GOLD broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch by daylight, got out while continuing to set the pace exiting the turn, held the runner up
safe late runner under steady handling. SIANARA broke well, closest to the winner to that one's outside, chased that same rival into the turn, floated out to
be four wide into the stretch, could not get there late despite brisk encouragement. VILLAREGGIA off a step slow, trailed early, three wide rally out of the
turn, along for the show while not a match for the top two. TAPPIN INTO SUMMER behind the leaders just off the inside, continued in even fashion through
the stretch to prove empty the final furlong. BLAME THE RED CAT settled off the pace and the inside, three path turn, also had little left in the late going to
lose the show. DIAL DISH lacked speed toward the inside, behind traffic, forced to wait late in the turn, moved out for the drive, lacked a response when
clear. MOTOWN GIRL off a step slow, moved up to race closest to the top two early, began to fade prior to four furlongs. CAGED BEAR was finished early
while four wide.

Footnotes
GOLDEN TIGER closest to the dueling leaders while off the inside, advanced and angled out four wide to challenge entering the stretch, put a head in front
past the furlong marker and edged clear. EAST MOON LAKE void of early speed while in the two path, called on for some run while three wide midway on
the turn, crossed to the inside when within striking distance of the winner with a furlong remaining, could do little with that rival the final sixteenth while
drawing well clear for the place. ROGALLO broke back, lacked speed, two path through much of the turn, roused in the three path into the stretch, improved
position, along for the show. WYOMING CONQUEST broke sharp, set or forced the pace for five furlongs in the three path, weakened in the final furlong.
LIMBO'S PROMISE went one paced while racing toward the inside. CHANGE DIRECTION in mid pack while outside, moved out to be five wide turning for
home, lacked a closing kick. JACK VAN BERG dueled up front closest to the inside for a half and gave way. TAPALIST off a step slow, trailed throughout in
showing little.

Footnotes
FLAT LUCKY raced back off the pace toward the inside, emerged from between horses turning for home, challenged well inside the leader past the furlong
marker, clear late. ACE DESTROYER dueled up front off the inside, disposed of the other speed by late in the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, was
straightened with a brisk right handed stick, proved no match for the winner late, clearly second best. HE'S MEANT TO BE within striking distance and
closest to the early duel, three path turning for home, nothing for top two late, gained nod for the show. MINE MY TIME back off the early pace, four wide
entering the stretch, displayed some mild late interest, missed the nod for the show. CARPE VICTORIAM dueled up front for just under a half while closest
to the inside, weakened in the drive. PLEASE THE COURT last to leave, trailed for a half, passed tiring rivals while not a serious threat. JERRYS
PRIDENJOY in the second flight off the inside, four out to five wide when moving slightly closer late in the turn, lacked a finishing kick in the drive. BAR
STOOL BUDGET settled well off the pace inside, failed to muster a rally. SPLASH FOR GOLD broke back and was always outrun.

SPECIAL RESERVE allowed the pace to go early, four wide early in the turn, came five wide into the lane, challenged entering the stretch, clear past the
furlong marker, enough left to last. SHOPLIFTED void of speed off the inside, came three out to four wide exiting the turn while in a bit tight, floated out by a
drifting ROYAL DAAHER late, outkicked that one for the place while getting to the winner. ROYAL DAAHER closest to the dueling leaders off the rail, in
tight, checked up turning for home, recovered, rallied past the furlong marker, drifted out late, not enough for the second spot while between the top two at
the wire. GREEN LIGHT GO one paced inside, got through a large opening inside the tiring leaders turning for home, finished up evenly in lacking a late
kick. TAKES TWO TO TANGO broke sharp, dueled up front closest to but not on the rail, slight advantage into the lane, faltered in the drive. BANDIT
POINT last to leave, trailed well back, picked off a couple of foes after the issue had been decided. SHACKLEFORD'S JOY was never a threat. PLANE
TALK dueled up front in the three path for almost a half and stopped.

Footnotes
BOLDOR raced off the early pace and the inside, four wide into the turn, three wide midway on the bend, steered back out for room entering the stretch, set
down for the drive, kicked down the two leaders to be going away at the end. SEVEN NATION ARMY away with the field, moved out to stalk the leader from
the outside into the turn, continued to prompt that one into the lane, challenged past the furlong marker, between horses late, second best. MR.
JAGERMEISTER broke in good order, cleared toward the inside the opening quarter, showed the way through the turn, responded when challenged by the
winner when straightened for home and gave ground grudgingly to that rival and the winner until late. FLAGSTAFF fell back to race unhurried for a half,
raced inside of the top flight into the lane, displayed some belated interest to close the gap while remaining toward the rail. STRIKE POWER broke sharp,
fell back off the pace while closest to the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, went evenly through the lane while remaining on the inside.
MUCHO in the second flight well wide, five path through the turn, tired in the drive.

Footnotes
HEATED ARGUMENT close from the start while off the inside, three wide in the turn when moving to challenge, clear turning for home, expanded that
advantage past the furlong marker, stayed on to remain well clear to the wire while well out in the strip. KABOOM BABY back early off the pace, angled out
while making a strong move five wide turning for home, could do little with the winner the final furlong, clearly second best. MY GRACE within striking
distance, came five into the turn, no match for the top two in the drive, finished well clear to prove best of the rest. LONGNTALL broke back, fell far back,
continued to lag into the turn, swung six wide into the lane, finished willingly while too late. JANET'S ROCKET off slowly, raced back, three wide through the
turn, improved position while not a serious threat. SPURWINK LANE dueled up front off the inside, began to weaken late in the turn, continued to retreat
through the lane. DAIGLE broke alertly, dueled closest to the inside, fell back in the turn, remained back in the drive. SARAHS HOME back off the pace well
wide, five path into the turn, four wide into the lane, came up empty when asked. TOMS MAXIMILLIAN in the two path in the main body, failed to respond in
the drive. SPOT'S MAINE GIRL off slowly, trailed well back early, passed tiring rivals. THIS GIRL DOES broke well, forwardly placed early along the inside,
checked up in tight quarters entering the turn, fell back to lose all chance. CANDYSSONGDANCE steadily faded while three wide.
