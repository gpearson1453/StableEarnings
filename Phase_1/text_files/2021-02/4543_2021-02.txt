Footnotes
SILVER MOMENT was quickest and set the pace in the three path to the stretch, responded to strong urging and held off rivals stubbornly. SAL MAGLIE
chased the winner three wide, swung out five wide into the stretch then closed ground but too late. PROOF OF PARANOIA stalked the pace from the rail to
the stretch, responded to mid stretch then dug in but was outfinished. SECOND BOLD got outsprinted to the turn, had to circle six wide to the stretch then
closed some ground late. CIEN POR CIEN pressed the winner while four wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and lacked a closing response.
TEXAS BOB had no speed and saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
TOOLEY TUNES was unhurried for a half mile, rallied two wide to engage for the lead into the stretch, pushed away to mid stretch and held driving.
RAELEE was settled to the half, saved ground into the second turn then was steered out nearing the quarter pole for room but cut off ICE KITTY causing
that to clip heels and stumble then chased the winner home. RANDOM PLEASURE lagged to the second turn then saved ground but was never a threat.
MUNNY hustled clear to the backstretch, set the pace from the rail to the second turn then was overtaken into the stretch and gave out. ICE KITTY chased
the pace to the second turn, was trying to rally three deep then was cut off by RAELEE, clipped heels, stumbled then was not persevered with in the stretch.
The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident between ICE KITTY and RAELEE and disqualified RAELEE from second to fifth for interference.

PHANTOM DROP pressed the leader three wide, moved up on the turn, to engage for the lead, edged away under urging to mid stretch then held driving.
MATTAWA N THAT set the pace while in the two path, was collared by the winner into the stretch, was tiring but saved the place. THE SHYSTER got
outsprinted to the turn, made a menacing run circling four wide on the turn but could not sustain that bid and finished evenly. FORAGOODTIMECALL
chased the pace from the rail to the stretch then did not rally. ENTREZ NOUS tracked early, was boxed leaving the half mile pole and steadied then raced in
check to the middle of the turn and did not threaten. RENEGADE CHIEF had no speed and was not a factor.

JENPIRESTRIKESBACK was outrun to the turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, continued to respond in the drive, wore down COASTAL STARLITE and
held off CALIFORNIA COMET for the win. CALIFORNIA COMET was slow to settle and trailed, circled four wide to the stretch then closed steadily in the
final sixteenth. COASTAL STARLITE pressed the pace to the turn, moved alongside REGAL LADY three wide, pushed to the front in mid stretch then was
tiring and could not save the place. REGAL LADY set the pace inside rivals, was off the rail to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.
CIRCULODEGANADORAS tracked the pace early, was two wide on turn but tired in the drive.

Footnotes
RIP WHEELER attended the pace outside a rival, was three wide on the turn, inched away to mid stretch then held stubbornly. TIME IS GONE stalked the
leaders to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, responded to mid stretch to loom a threat to the winner but was outfinished. SOUL PRODIGY got
outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, shifted out and rallied to also loom boldly in mid stretch but flattened out late. THEY'RE GRRREAT
tracked the pace three wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. INCREDIBLE CHAMP was erratic in the opening furlong, settled
but trailed to the stretch then was not a factor. UJUSTDON'TGETIT hustled to duel inside the winner to the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
RESPECT THE HUSTLE used natural speed to establish a good position, pressed the pace to the second turn, moved to engage for the lead into the
stretch, edged clear to mid stretch then held determinedly. SOBERANO (FR) settled mid pack to the second turn, shifted off the rail and was two wide to the
stretch then eased back in and closed willingly to the line. UPO threw his head at the start and was rank, had no speed, bid three wide into the second turn,
swung out five deep into the lane then finished in a rally. UNLAWFUL ACT was chasing to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, was outkicked
by the winner to mid stretch and lacked the needed late response. HARVEST A STORM tracked the pace to the half, was two then three wide to the stretch
but came up empty in the drive. OCEAN FURY hustled to get to the front, set the pace from off the rail for six furlongs, got collared in upper stretch and
weakened. TERRYS TOM CAT had no speed and was not a factor.
