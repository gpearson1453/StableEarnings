Footnotes
ORIGINAL INTENT saved ground under restraint on the first turn, came out entering the stretch for the first time, was reserved near the back, moved closer
in the two path on the second turn as the field began to bunch, moved out with six furlongs to run, tracked the pace down the backstretch, was asked at the
seven-sixteenths, chased four then five wide on the final turn, came under the whip outside the five-sixteenths, chased outside in the drive under vigorous
handling, gained on the runner-up late and got up in the final stride and a half to prevail. CHOP CHOP CHARLIE went straight to the front, showed the way
while inside to the two path, came under pressure while getting a little extra left-rein guidance on the final turn, came out into upper stretch then responded
well under a right-handed whip, drifted out while leading determinedly into the final sixteenth, had the rider drop his right rein late and was denied in a game
effort but was clear for the place. ZANESVILLE was reserved while two to three wide, moved closer on the second turn, advanced even closer with a
half-mile to run then was asked, chased two then three wide on the final turn, pursued the runner-up under the whip into the final sixteenth and weakened
but was clear for the show. G'S TURN was slowest into stride, went three then two wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, went four wide while
closer on the second turn, continued towards the back of the field, dropped from the four path to the rail under urging on the final turn, turned into the stretch
under the whip and came up empty. CAP ROCK MINER raced in the three path on the first turn, drifted out while tracking the pace down the stretch for the
first time, rounded the second turn in the three path, came under urging midway down the backstretch, chased three to four wide on the final turn and
faltered. YEOWZER dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, settled on the inside, came out while dropping back late on the backstretch and
faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
G'S A LOOKER was hustled to the lead then moved in, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the turn, responded well
when set down in upper stretch and held under strong urging. EVE'S DELIGHT settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive, chased the winner into the final sixteenth then drifted out and safely secured the place. MISS LAUGHALOT moved out under
urging early then dropped in and bothered a foe midway down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch under the whip
and lacked the needed response while along for the show. KIMMY was taken up while shut-off by MISS LAUGHALOT midway down the backstretch and
lost position, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn and failed to rally. HONG KONG STRONG showed speed on the inside of the winner, was
taken back off the pace near the five-eighths then moved out and tracked the leader, came under urging in the three path on the turn, chased four wide into
the stretch then drifted further out, dropped back while still on her inside lead into the final furlong, swerved out when switching leads at the sixteenth-pole
and tired. FLAT OUT CRYPTO broke a step slow, settled well back in the field, was urged four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. SEEKING THE
STARS broke out and a step slow, settled on the far outside, lugged out six to seven wide on the turn and came up empty. SHOOTING STICK broke a step
slow, settled off the pace, was urged four wide on the turn then came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
YES HE CAN showed good speed and set the pace under some pressure to his outside, moved clear coming to the half-mile pole, saved ground on the
turn, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, swapped back to his inside lead under threat from the runner-up at the furlong marker and
held under strong urging. COLTONATOR was well placed just off the pace, chased in the two path on the turn, gained coming to the quarter-pole, pursued
the winner on the outside in the stretch and couldn't get by but finished willingly to be well clear for the place. OMEGA MOON was urged along off the pace,
went three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and weakened while best of the rest. TRINGALE settled off the pace, checked severely
and swerved out to avoid the injured rival nearing the half-mile pole, lost many lengths on the front three in the process, went four then three wide on the
turn and failed to threaten. HOLD ME BLACK broke out and a bit slow, checked severely and swerved out to avoid the injured foe approaching the half-mile
pole, lost many lengths on the front three in the process, went six to seven wide on the turn, drifted further out in upper stretch and was no factor. HILTON
MAGIC pressed the pace on the outside, went wrong outside the half-mile pole and was pulled up then vanned off.

by at the quarter-pole, regained momentum by the three-sixteenths and got up for the place. PEACE BROKER was hard held while keen off heels near the
rail on the first turn, settled just off the pace on the backstretch, was given her cue while inside to the two path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and
narrowly missed the place while just able to get the show. NAUGHTY RENDEZVOUS bumped lightly with a foe at the start, went to the front, rounded the
first turn in the two path, showed the way through solid fractions, vied inside under heavy pressure on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired.

dropped from the two path to the rail under urging on the far turn and failed to threaten. LET'S SKEDADDLE bumped lightly with a rival at the start, bumped
with a foe into the first turn, went three then four wide on that bend, settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
LADY OF LUXURY was taken in hand early then well placed just off the pace, moved out late on the backstretch, ranged up four wide on the turn, made a
bid outside the quarter-pole, took over when asked for her best in upper stretch then kicked clear, drifted in inside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the
best under steady urging. GOULDING showed speed then dropped just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, chased
the winner under the whip into the final furlong and proved no match but was up for the place. GIANNA'S GIFT moved up after the start to set the pace, vied
along the rail on the turn, was asked in the two path into the stretch, lost the lead under a drive at the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong
and tired while able to hold the show. SIXTH STREET broke a bit slow, moved in towards the rear then was taken in hand approaching the half-mile pole,
went three wide while roused on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out under a drive and weakened. APRIL'S NO FOOL bumped
with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and came up empty. ZEBECCA
broke out the start, was in tight near the five-eighths pole then wrestled back to the rear of the field, dropped from three to two wide on the turn and failed to
threaten. AMERICAN LEGEND bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn then came six wide into the stretch
and failed to respond.

ELLE Z brushed the outside of the gate at the start, showed good speed and set the clear pace, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, extended
the advantage outside the quarter-pole, responded well when set down in upper stretch and powered home under steady urging. INTO MYSTIC broke in at
the start, settled at the rear of the quartet, saved ground on the turn, moved out while roused for more into the stretch, chased the winner under a drive into
the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. SHE'S MY GEM tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the
turn, dropped back late on that bend and tired. MISTY DAY veered out and hit the gate at the start and spotted the front a few lengths, settled on the
outside, advanced four wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and came up empty.
