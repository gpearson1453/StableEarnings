FOUR O'FIVE assumed command of a moderate pace while travelling on the rail, drew clear in the final stages. ON ICE steadied off of heels on the first
turn, saved ground on the rail, rallied in the stretch to advance position and was second best. SECOND BOLD sat off of a moderate pace while travelling in
the three path and closed evenly to get third. GOLD N GRAND was unhurried early, traveled at the rear of the field, made late move to pass a tiring rival.
TWOBITSOFIRISH pressed a moderate pace while travelling in the two path, showed speed while pressing the pace into the far turn and faded late.

Footnotes
SHE'S SO PRETTY stalked the pace widest to the backstretch then pushed to the front nearing the five eighths, set the pace off the rail then drew clear to
mid stretch and held driving. MISS YOU MOM trailed to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch then did not threaten the winner but bested the others.
TOTALLY NORMAL was allowed to settle for a half mile, offered a run three deep on the far turn but got outkicked by the winner and came up empty in the
drive. SPUN AWAY tracked the pace to the second turn, was off the rail to the stretch then lacked a closing response. MARIAH GIRL (ARG) hustled to the
front but was caught and passed by the winner early on the backstretch, prompted that one while saving ground to the stretch then weakened.

Footnotes
MOSQUITO FLEET stalked the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide to take over, pushed away to mid stretch then was tiring but held on
determinedly. GEE GEE WHIZ was forced out four deep by PERSEVERANCE on the first turn, shifted back in then settled on the backstretch, circled rivals
five wide to the stretch then finished steadily for second. INFATUATE was forced out five wide by PERSERVERANCE to the backstretch, also settled to the
far turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch and was gaining ground late. AFLEETING LIFE checked shortly after the start, trailed to the half, was three
wide to the stretch and closed some ground to the line. POGO had good speed to the backstretch then was passed by PERSERVERANCE, pressed that
one to the second turn, got outkicked to the stretch then did not rally. PERSEVERANCE pulled the rider once on the first turn who eased him out to the
three path forcing both GEE GEE WHIZ and INFATUATE further out, set the pace to the second turn then was overtaken and gave way in the stretch.

took command of a moderate pace while saving ground on the rail, dueled in the stretch and was an easy runner-up. COMMAND SGT MAJOR settled
mid-pack, pressured the leaders along the far turn while travelling in the three path and finished evenly for third. SPEEDY TOM stalked a moderate pace
while racing in the two path, lost position turning into the lane and finished evenly. JUST WATCH ME NOW settled towards the rear of the field while saving
ground, and was no threat. AMERICAN BUDDHA broke a step slowly, raced at the rear of the pack and was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
GENTLEMAN'S SECRET was well placed off the leader, rallied three wide to take over into the stretch, pushed away to mid stretch and held driving. IRISH
TERRIER chased the pace to the turn, was three wide to the stretch then got outkicked by the winner but gamely dug in to save second. IRISH SWING had
no speed, was two wide to the stretch then also did not threaten the winner but dug in and just missed the place. MONSTRODAMOUS was outsprinted
early, got fanned four wide on the turn and could not muster a closing bid. RED STAR was also outrun to the turn, raced four wide to the stretch and finished
evenly. SILVER MOMENT hustled to the front, set the pace in the two path, was collared by the winner into the stretch and tired.
