Footnotes
RAY AREWETHEREYET set a pressured pace while racing just off the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. LOVELORN LADY hit
the starting gate and was in tight when his neighbors filled the void and bumped in front of him, saved ground off the pace, tipped out near the eight pole
and finished willingly. FREAK pressed the winner two wide, could not keep pace in upper stretch but stayed on to hold third. OGLALA raced four wide off the
pace, lugged in a bit in upper stretch, straightened out under left-handed urging in upper stretch, stayed on the left lead and proved no threat. ELUSIVE
UNCAPTURED bumped with CHICA BOOM at the start, stalked the pace three wide, drifted out turning for home and faded. DANZATALE failed to menace
while racing two wide. CHICA BOOM bumped with ELUSIVE UNCAPTURED at the start and played no further factor while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
MAGICGIRL brought up the rear unhurried for six furlongs, swung widest coming off the far turn, kicked in nicely and overhauled SKYE SNOW from outside
in time. SKYE SNOW tracked outside KOURVOISIER, challenged for command a quarter-mile out, reached the front coming to the furlong marker and
edged clear, but could not withstand the winner. MAKEME DREAM raced two wide around the turns, rallied mildly through the stretch and was clearly best
of the others. SOOTHING saved ground on the turns in the second flight, had the rider drop the whip in upper stretch, and ran on evenly. HALAMA tugged
along inside through the stretch the first time, stayed close to the stretch and tired with an eighth of a mile remaining. TALKTHETALK stayed in range two to
three wide early, and tired after six furlongs. KOURVOISIER (IRE) quickly cleared to the lead, showed the way to the stretch, and gave way on the rail
approaching the eighth-pole.

Footnotes
CHASING ARTIE set a rated pace inside, responded when roused right-handed in upper stretch and held clear. WORA settled off the pace two wide,
angled four wide near the quarter pole, finished willingly outside but was unable to seriously gain on the winner. MR ANNOYING broke in and bumped HIGH
YIELD KITTEN at the start, quickly recovered to show speed inside, lightly steadied off the winner's heels near the half-mile pole, stalked inside around the
turn, could not keep pace with the top two in the lane but stayed on to remain well clear of the rest. SPEIGHT AND MALICE saved ground off the pace,
tipped out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. HIGH YIELD KITTEN was bumped at the start, dropped well back inside, angled out in upper stretch and
never threatened. DREAM OF WARRIOR prompted the winner two wide and came up empty in the lane. LEWIS CAL broke awkwardly and played no factor
while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
KNOWN AGENDA was a half-step slow at the break, moved out four wide into the first turn, remained in that path joining the leaders under confident
handling midway on the far turn, took over outside TOP GUN TOMMY getting his hind end brushed by the latter at the top of the stretch, shifted to the rail
roused and well clear through the furlong grounds, and was geared down into the final sixteenth of a mile. TOP GUN TOMMY vied early inside ETCHED IN
STONE, let that one go and moved out to stay on the chase, came under a ride to reach the front three wide between horses after six furlongs, was quickly
overhauled by KNOWN AGENDA coming to the five-sixteenths, brushed with that one and steadied while shifting out, continued drifting to midtrack and
greenly swapped back to his left lead a furlong out, and remained clear of the rest. WARRIOR IN CHIEF put in an early challenge three then two wide after
a half-mile, but could not keep pace with the top two after six furlongs. AMOUNT was no factor three to four wide throughout. ALL BODES WELL was outrun
inside. ETCHED IN STONE contested the pace outside TOP GUN TOMMY going to the first turn, moved in with the lead entering the backstretch, came
under attack from three pursuers into the far turn and retreated. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF TOP GUN TOMMY FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH WAS DISMISSED.

Footnotes
THOROVER set the pace in the two path and widened under a drive. EXONERATED PREZ stalked the winner from the rail, angled out in upper stretch and
finished evenly to hold the place. SPEIGHT raced four wide in midpack early, advanced outside in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong.
MORNING TRIAL broke in a tangle, raced well back three and four wide and improved position in the lane. CON PERMISO was not a threat while racing
three wide and was vanned off after the finish. LITTLE DUDE prompted the winner from the three path and tired in the lane. EXTRACTION WILL failed to
menace while racing two wide. AIKMAN was outrun outside. WATER CAY was outrun inside. TESTIFIED made little impact while racing two wide. PRINCE
TRITON had some speed two wide, steadied while tiring nearing the lane and continued to retreat through the lane.

Footnotes
AUSTRIAN saved ground at the back for six furlongs, split SEMPER FI and THE MIGHTY JUDGE rallying through upper stretch, caught LIGHT FURY from
outside a sixteenth out and drove clear. LIGHT FURY cleared inside with the lead around the first turn, shook off THE MIGHTY JUDGE approaching the
stretch, could not handle the winner late but held well to be clearly second best. SEMPER FI raced close up inside to the stretch, and lacked the needed
closing bid. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT stayed in range for six furlongs two then three wide, and faded in the lane. THE MIGHTY JUDGE pressed the pace
outside LIGHT FURY to the far turn, got shaken off a quarter-mile out, and weakened. RECKLESS SPIRIT checked sharply then steadied along with no
room inside going to the first turn, attempted a five-wide sweep coming to the top of the stretch, but was empty. NOTSOSUBTLE moved up outside rivals
through the middle stages, came under a ride three then four wide around the far turn, and gave way into the stretch.

Footnotes
TREVESS stalked the pace three wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, vied outside through upper stretch then drove clear. ABARRIO FOREVER raced
off the pace two and three wide then rallied between foes to gain the place. MY LITTLE ROSE was in range inside down the backstretch, angled four wide
near the three-eighths marker, drifted further out turning for home then stayed on between foes to gain the show. KATNISS KAN raced off the pace five
deep rounding the turn, was carried further out turning for home and was outfinished for the show. LALALI dueled two wide to upper stretch and weakened.
MS BIG SPRING dueled inside to upper stretch and tired. MYFIRSTEXWIFE saved ground off the pace, angled out near the quarter pole, had a mild gain
between but lacked a closing bid. RAIN was outrun while racing four wide. PLAY THAT TONE stumbled at the start and never threatened while racing two
wide. BLESSED BEAST steadily faded while racing three wide.

BREAKING ALONE settled off the pace two wide for six furlongs, shifted out a bit further turning for home, switched leads past the eighth-pole and was up
late between horses under strong handling. HALCYON DIGEST sped off to a lengthy early lead, remained clear into the final furlong while beginning to
labor, and had just enough to save second inside rivals. UNCLE FUN was outrun for six furlongs, came wide for the drive, rallied steadily and just missed
outside the top two. JEHA saved ground throughout, and lacked a solid closing response. LONG BEACH KID chased the breakaway leader to the stretch,
stayed on his left lead and was outfinished. GOLOVKIN chased two to three wide, tired in the stretch, pulled up quickly and was unsaddled on the turf
course, and was ponied back. RUN-UP DISTANCE UNAVAILABLE.

RUNNING MEMORIES bumped with CLASSIC SECRET at the start, vied outside that rival to the turn before clearing off, and remained well in command
under a steady drive. JULIE BIRD (IRE) raced three to four wide around the turn, and could not menace the winner while clearly second best. CHIPS AND
SALSA was outrun early two wide, rallied mildly and was up for the show outside rivals. BEAUTY BOSS brushed with KAREN'S WAY at the start, saved
ground to the stretch, and finished evenly between horses. IZSHEFROSTED chased after the leaders two to three wide to the stretch, moved inside and
weakened. PRIZE PORTRAIT was outrun to the turn toward the inside, and passed only tired horses. KAREN'S WAY brushed with BEAUTY BOSS at the
start, and steadied while unable to keep pace entering the turn. BELLA SOFI was outrun three to four wide. CLASSIC SECRET bumped with RUNNING
MEMORIES at the start, hustled up to vie inside that one to the turn, and was finished approaching the stretch. MISS CONSTITUTION was never
prominent.
