Footnotes
ODRAMARK broke a step slowly and lied well off of the pace along the inside, rated in the two path around the turn before swinging five wide turning for
home, rallied outside of foes, sustained her bid as the leader herded her outwards inside the final furlong, and got up late. SAMMY'S TOWN stalked three
wide, bid for the lead turning for home, forged an advantage in upper stretch, but drifted out many paths inside the final furlong, and was caught
approaching the wire. HENNI PENNY lied off of the pace three wide, commenced a four wide rally turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer rival in
midstretch, then kept on to catch an inner foe for show. PROPER MANNERS tracked from midpack two wide, shifted three wide turning for home, but was
outkicked by an outer foe in midstretch, then chased the leaders home before getting outfinished for show. AKOR trailed the field in the three path around
the turn, then passed tiring foes in the final sixteenth without threatening. SILVER TUNES vied along the inside early on, allowed an outer foe to clear into
the turn, stalked that rival around the turn, but faded through the lane. MS HEADLEY set the pace two wide early on, cleared her inner rival into the turn, but
was headed by another foe in upper stretch, then weakened at the sixteenth marker. PLAY THAT TONE chased from midpack along the inside, and
weakened through the lane.

STARSHIP NANA set the pace along the inside while feeling pressure from MAUREENLOVESFRANK, then inside of SKYFLY as well passing the five
sixteenths pole, but shook clear of those rivals in upper stretch, and held sway to the wire. SKYFLY stalked along the inside, shifted three wide into the turn,
bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, vied turning for home, but failed to keep pace with her innermost rival in upper stretch, and chased that foe home
to prove second best. MAUREENLOVESFRANK vied two wide, then from between horses passing the five sixteenths pole, but weakened in upper stretch.
MANUELA failed to factor. WE BLESS LUCK stalked three wide, but was done early. BROADWAY DIVA came out of the gates multiple lengths slowly, and

Footnotes
EXCHANGE DAY sprinted clear after the start, rated along inside to the stretch, stayed on his left lead and faced no challenges. ZAMFIR raced three wide
around the turn, and wore down SPEARGUN from outside to get the place. SPEARGUN chased outside the winner to the stretch, and was outfinished for
second. SPEND BENJAMINS saved ground throughout, and lacked the needed closing bid. NO COMMISSION was never a factor. THIS DUDES NO FOOL
steadied along the rail early near the back, and remained outrun. CRAZY SHOT lost his footing at the break and spotted the field a couple lengths, and
never reached contention.

Footnotes
SAMBACER set the pace, managed a loose lead down the backstretch, widened her advantage around the far turn, then tired in the final furlong, but held
safely to the wire. RELIABILITY was slow into stride and trailed the field early on, rallied four wide around the far turn to the closest pursuer to the loose
leader turning for home, chased that foe through the lane while grinding away at his advantage, but did not have enough to catch her. COWTOWN saved
ground far off of the pace around the first turn, shifted to the two path into the far turn before tipping four wide around that bend, then commenced a rally
turning for home, but only offered a mild kick. DILIGENT tracked from midpack along the inside, but got held up behind tiring rivals around the far turn while
outer foes advanced, swung to the five path turning for home, and stayed on for a minor share. FLY FLY AWAY lied off of the pace two to three wide around
the turns, attempted a rally far turn, but got outmoved by RELIABILITY at the quarter pole, then flattened out and tired through the lane. LAVERY stalked
two wide, but faded into the far turn and was done early. EMICRACK (CHI) stalked along the inside, but faded into the far turn and was done early.

MANITOWISH pressed the pace outside SECRET POTION, got shaken off turning for home, stayed on task and wore that rival down late. SECRET
POTION grabbed the early lead inside, edged away in the two-path after a half-mile, settled into the stretch with a clear advantage, drifted out late and could
not withstand the winner. BEN COPENHAGEN was forwardly placed inside to the top of the stretch, and lacked a closing bid. SUMMER SERMON hit the
left side of the gate and was slowest away, swung four wide taking closer order after a half, but could not sustain the rally. VALUE CREATION was finished
early three wide. BIG CITY DREAMS trailed throughout toward the inside.

HYPERFOCUS trailed in the two path around the first turn, rated off of the pace in the two to three path around the far turn before smoothly tipping five wide
in upper stretch, rallied outside of foes through the final furlong to produce a bid in the late stages, and bumped his inner rallying counterpart at the wire
while getting up. EASY TIME stalked along the inside, tipped out from behind the leading trio approaching the furlong pole, rallied inside of HYPERFOCUS
through the late stages, then was bumped by that foe on the wire while getting outfinished. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN stalked three wide, bid for the lead
at the quarter pole, dueled outside of RAISON D'AIR through the lane, but was outkicked by a pair of outer rallying foes approaching the wire. RAISON
D'AIR set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of pressing foes around the far turn, dug in through upper stretch as his outermost
counterpart forged an advantage, sustained the battle after flopping back to his left lead inside the furlong pole, then yielded late. FUEGO CALIENTE saved
ground off of the pace, but to no avail. OMAHA CITY tugged around the first turn to vie for the lead two wide, then from between horses around the far turn
before weakening in midstretch. KIGER lied off of the pace two to four wide around the turns, then faded turning for home. ORIGINAL TIMES REINSTATED
UPON REVIEW; RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
OUR FANTASY tracked outside the early leaders, took over with a four-wide run approaching the quarter-pole, shifted to the two-path vying outside DIZZY
into the stretch, and drove clear. DIZZY was unhurried early inside, moved menacingly along the rail to join the leaders after six furlongs, moved off the
inside unable to match strides with OUR FANTASY through the furlong grounds, and ran on second best. TIZ ENOUGH set the early pace, got overhauled
from both flanks approaching the stretch, and stayed on well enough to remain clear for the show. NATIONALIST raced three then two wide around the turn,
and failed to threaten. NACHO MAMA prompted the early pace outside TIZ ENOUGH, and tired after six furlongs. BLUEYED PRINCESS vied for the lead
leaving the chute, and retreated before completing a half-mile.

Footnotes
MISS TEHERAN (IRE) lied well off of the pace along the inside, checked slightly into the first turn, inched closer two wide and between horses under her
own power turning for home, smoothly tipped five wide in upper stretch to split horses passing the furlong marker, and offered a stout kick to run down the
clear leader approaching the wire. JEZEBEL'S KITTEN set the pace along the inside, shook clear from a pressing rival in upper stretch, held a clear margin
into the late stages, but was caught approaching the wire while tiring a bit. IN A HURRY tracked from midpack along the inside, the from the two path
around the far turn, cut the corner turning for home to produce a grinding rally along the rail through the lane, but was outkicked passing the sixteenth pole,
and chased well to the wire. GOLDEN CURL prompted the pace from the four to three path around the first turn, pressed the leader two wide around the far
turn, but failed to keep pace with that rival in upper stretch, and faded through the final furlong. SUN SUMMERS lied off of the pace two wide, gained mildly
four to five wide around the far turn, but was outkicked by an inner rival in midstretch, then stayed on thereafter. TIZAHRA tracked from midpack in the three
path, gained ground four wide around the far turn to striking range, but flattened out between horses approaching the furlong grounds. MARIAFOOT (FR)
lied far off of the pace three wide around both turns, swung seven wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor. LUCKY POLLY lied forwardly placed two to
three wide, but was outkicked by an outer foe turning for home, chased from between horses through midstretch, then faded. MY GAL BETTY trailed the
field early on, took the far turn in the three path, but was bothered by CHOATE BRIDGE's incident turning for home, bolted to the six path in the process,
then improved late. RUNWAY DREAMER lied far off of the pace two wide around both turns, got bothered turning for home behind CHOATE BRIDGE, and
failed to factor. CECI VALENTINA stalked from the two path, came under a drive to keep pace into the far turn while along the rail, then weakened turning
for home. CHOATE BRIDGE lied off of the pace along the inside, tipped to the two path around the far turn, but steadied hard in tight quarters between
horses turning for home, and was protected thereafter. A GENERAL STEWARDS' INQUIRY WAS CONDUCTED LOOKING INTO THE AT THE INCIDENT
ENTERING THE STRETCH, BUT NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
ROMP stumbled at the break and bumped with CARROTS OR CARATS, began picking it up four wide and under a drive midway on the turn, took over
outside WEIGHT OF GLORY under heavy pressure into the stretch, drew clear and was taken in hand near the sixteenth-pole. WEIGHT OF GLORY
bumped with WILL TAKE CONTROL at the start, set the pace inside, was no match for the winner turning for home, and saved the place. WILL TAKE
CONTROL bumped with WEIGHT OF GLORY at the start, raced close up inside to the turn, lodged a brief bid in the two-path approaching the stretch, and
ran on to narrowly miss second. LOAD UP MOE was outrun to the stretch, and passed tired horses. FLAMINGO HAWK stumbled at the start and recovered
bumping into FLEX, raced two to three wide and tired after a half-mile. CURVE prompted the pace three wide, and faltered approaching the stretch. FLEX
bumped with FLAMINGO HAWK at the start, and was through early. CARROTS OR CARATS bumped with ROMP at the start, and retired after a half. WILD
TEXAS TOM broke slowly, was pulled up before going a half, got unsaddled on the backstretch and was ponied back.
