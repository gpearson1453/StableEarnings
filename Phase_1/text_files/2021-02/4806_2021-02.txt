Footnotes
CREATIVE LEGACY forwardly placed early along the inside, continued to race closest to the leader up the backstretch, moved out a bit and engaged that
rival midway on the second turn, asked along then shook clear into the lane while drifting out then in, remained clear to the wire while continuing to drft.
PERKS D'ORO broke out, raced off the early pace and the inside, ranged up to challenge four wide in the second turn, drifted out past the furlong marker to
lose the second spot past the furlong marker, set down, came back for that position while not a threat to the winner. MAKING PROGRESS lacked speed,
raced in the two path far turn, move out a bit turning for home them moved closer inside of a foe or two, hung in the late going to be outkicked for the place.
SOLEMN OATH allowed the pace to go early, advanced to challenge inside the runner up in the final turn, hung in the drive. WILD ESCAPE last to leave,
trailed for five furlongs, moved closer when five down to four wide in the second turn, flattened out in the drive. JLOHR JAN settled up front along the inside,
had little for the drive. CHEWY CHEWY GOOD sprinted clear in the first turn in the two path, set the pace most of the middle half mile, gave way along the
inside when headed by the winner in the second turn.

Footnotes
CINNAMON VICTORY never far back toward the inside, moved up when called on for some run into the turn, went after the leader in the two path soon
after, clear late in the bend, well clear under firm handling. RISKY SITUATION in the main body off the inside, came in the two path for the drive, proved no
match for the winner the final furlong, clear second best. RANDOM AFFAIR back off the pace well out in the strip, was four wide through the turn, bumped
with ONLY ICON nearing and then again past the furlong marker, finished up evenly to be clear of the others. ROCK CITY ROCKET lacked early foot, also
raced four wide through much of the turn, showed some mild interest to improve position, no real threat. HOSS J W main body while saving ground, asked
along turn, went evenly in the drive. LIME TREE VALLEY void of speed for a half, off the inside early in the turn, dropped to the inside late in the turn,
improved position with some modest, belated interest. RUNAWAYPOINT off a step slow, raced back early, angled out to be three wide exiting the turn,
picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SHARP WILLY broke back, moved up a bit early then showed little thereafter in a dull
effort. DOUBLE BOGEY broke alertly, quickly sprinted well clear, stopped when headed by the winner midway on the turn. ONLY ICON bobbled after the
start, forwardly placed three wide, was giving way when bumped midstretch, continued to back up the final furlong. THE RACE WAS HANDTIMED DUE TO
TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
FRENCHIE FROU FROU broke out, within striking distance five wide into the turn, continued outside, steady advance through the stretch, carried out late,
brushed, just up. MANDAMUS dueled up front off the inside, shook clear into stretch, remained clear until drifting out late, nipped at the wire while brushing
with the winner. RED BOTTOM REBEL with the early pace along the inside, narrowly showed the way into the turn, headed by the winner midway on the
bend, fell back to prove no match for the top pair through the stretch, remained well clear of the others. KILBARRY LADY pressed the issue from the four
path up the backstretch, asked along through the turn, weakened gradually through the stretch. SHESHAPPY void of speed, trailed for a half while moving
out four wide through the turn, five wide into the lane, passed tiring rivals. LIL TATER back off the pace just off the inside, dropped to the rail turning for
home, went evenly through the stretch. PEEK A BOO I SEE U with the early pace while between rivals, faltered in the drive. COLLUDE off slow, remained
always back.

Footnotes
SOMETHING SUPER off slow, raced back, began to rally when four wide into the stretch, shifted out widest when straightened for home, roused, finished
with good energy to win going away. DARK NINJA broke alertly, set the early pace, vied into the lane, continued to narrowly hold the advantage past the
furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end to hold the place. HURRICANE JAKE off a step slow, moved up inside to be a forward factor into the turn,
continued to save ground through the bend, challenged past the furlong marker, not enough late for the place. COLLECTION lacked speed for a half,
dropped inside turning for home, improved by displaying some late interest through traffic. GOLDEN TIGER forwardly placed in some traffic, shuffled back
into the turn, moved out and came four wide for the drive, loomed prominently in midstretch only to flatten out late. K W CAPTAIN HOOK pressed the runner
up while four wide into the turn, three wide entering the stretch, tired. TOWN DRUNK prompted the issue in the three path the opening quarter and began to
tire by midway on the turn. SEEK N JUSTICE failed to menace. GRAND ATLANTIC forwardly placed while five wide into the turn, gave way before a half.

Footnotes
SWEET TATUM within striking distance well wide and under confident handling, five wide through the turn, took over into the stretch, drew well clear while
kept to pressure late. TONI ANN'S MIRACLE broke in and toward the back, lacked speed for a half, rallied three to four wide into the stretch, finished
willingly while too late. SCARLET POSITION vied up front closest to the inside, fell back early in the turn, asked along then squeezed through when
continuing along the rail turning for home, posed a threat a furlong out then flattened. FLEETA BELLE narrowly set the pace while between horses early,
continued to set the pace in the two path turn, allowed the winner the inside entering the stretch, weakened when headed by the winner soon after. WAR
BALLAD lacked speed, raced four wide through the turn, showed some belated interest while remaining well out in the strip. J P'S GLADYS last away,
trailed for three furlongs, steered four wide late turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. TRIPLE SCOUT went one paced throughout, lacked
kick. BRECHIN'S COMMAND remained always back. R MARIE pressured the pace for three furlongs in the four path, gave way turning for home. TEXAS
MUSIC flashed brief speed from between rivals then began a steady retreat before three furlongs.

Footnotes
WINDMILL with the pace outside, four down to three wide when continuing to vie through the turn, long drive, edging away late under firm handling. GOIN'
GOOD off a step slow, moved up steadily the opening quarter to join the leaders before the turn, held a narrow advantage through the bend and into the
lane, proved stubborn to the end, determined for the place. ABROGATE away in good order, raced with the pace between horses and inside the winner
through the turn, continued on equal terms with the top two into the lane, gradually weakened the final furlong, well clear of the others. BIG TIME lacked
speed off the inside, swung out four wide exiting the turn, finished up evenly in the drive in lacking a closing response while remaining well out in the strip.
MARIAH'S PRINCESS broke sharp, with the early pace inside, fell back into the turn, moved out four wide, closer late in the turn, flattened out in the drive.
MISS TWENTY fell back to trail, was never a threat.

WHISKEY DOUBLE broke with the field, raced in the second flight early, fell back a bit in the turn, came six wide into the stretch, finished with good late
energy to be up in time. CAUSEWAY JONES forwardly placed in the two path, challenged into the stretch, narrowly showed the way past the furlong
marker, could not contain the winner late. BOB'S EDGE forwardly placed, pressed the issue three wide into the lane, vied past the furlong marker, outkicked
in the late going while between the top two at the wire. LOCK UP moved up to take control the opening quarter, showed the way through the turn in the four
path, headed when straightened for home, weakened the final furlong. CITI CHARM off the pace while racing outside, four wide through the turn, went
evenly through the stretch in lacking a serious closing response. EDGE TO EDGE saved ground through the turn when behind the leaders, failed to muster
a rally when called on for the drive. XTREME MAYHEM off step slow, made little impact while racing in the two path. OUTASITE remained back while racing
three wide. LAWLESSNESS off slow, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
THE MARY ROSE outrun early while outside, four wide into and through much of the turn, steered five to six wide exiting the bend, closed with good resolve
down the middle of the strip to be up in time. MATAPAN in mid pack early while also far out in the strip, advanced five wide to challenge turning for home,
put a head in front past the furlong marker, led late, could not contain the winner late while holding sway for the place. MISS ANTIOCH forwardly placed off
the inside, took over to show the way into the lane, vied past the furlong marker, outkicked by the top two late while inside that pair. BYE BYE J broke back,
lacked speed, angled out sharply to be six wide and outside of traffic turning for home, staged a mild rally to improve position. SEKANI behind the pace in
the three path, improved through some traffic late in the turn, set down when clear for the drive, lacked a further response. OOCHIE broke alertly from the
outside, within striking distance on the outside the first flight, raced four wide through the turn then was found lacking when called on for the drive. DUTCH
TREAT last away, trailed, raced six wide through the turn, passed tiring rivals to improve position, not a serious threat. TIGER BAIT made little impact in
remaining back in the three path. TIDDLY squeezed to be in tight at the break, lacked speed, fanned seven wide into the lane, lacked a closing rally.
PROUD VICTORIA with the pace for a half in the two path and between horses, gave way in the drive. SAVEDBYANANGEL away in good order, set or
forced the pace closest to the inside, stopped stretch, jogged in.

Footnotes
MONOMOY GIRL broke with the field, prompted the pace under a snug hold into and through the first turn, continued to press the issue up the backstretch,
began to be ridden along midway on the final turn, firm hand ride into the lane when moving to take over, expanded that advantage past the furlong marker
then maintained daylight to the wire under an intermittent left handed stick. OUR SUPER FREAK closest to the leader off the inside, inched closer then
challenged in the second turn, put a head in front, vied between horses and inside the winner under a left handed crop into the lane, proved no match for
the winner late, came back for the place. FINITE away in good order, vied past the wire the first time, cleared closest to but still well off the inside by midway
on the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, headed second turn, continued to contest the issue into the lane, regained the second spot past the
furlong marker then weakened late to lose that position. CHANCE TO SHINE broke alertly, settled off the pace toward the inside, angled out to be three
wide turning for home, lacked a serious closing kick. ISTAN COUNCIL behind the pace off the inside, asked along into the lane, failed to muster a rally.
ANOTHER BROAD last away, trailed well back, lost contact with the field the final furlong and jogged in.

Footnotes
JOSIE in traffic into the first turn, came out, bit rank when steadying a bit, six wide, continued well out in the strip, ranged up five wide to be a forward factor
in the second turn, dueled past the furlong marker then edged clear late. WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY forwardly placed off the inside, three wide, challenged in
the second turn, stretch duel through the stretch, stubborn until late, clearly second best. AUCTION FEVER void of speed outside, began to move in the far
turn, rallied six wide in to the lane, finished well down the middle of the strip while too late for the top two. SHE'S ALL WOLFE settled off the pace, raced
three wide most of the way, went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing response. GLAMOUR GIRL moved out in the first turn, five down to four wide
second turn, also lacked a closing response through the lane. MISS MOON PIE broke well from the outside, cleared in the first turn, set the pace off the
inside, began to weaken when headed turning for home. HASHTAG WINNER void of speed, bothered and carried wide into the first turn, continued back,
improved slightly while not a threat. ESCAPE FUND bothered, carried wide into the first turn, moved in a bit and proceeded just off the inside second turn,
three wide into the lane, failed to rally. LADY MCKENZIE forwardly placed for six furlongs along the inside, gave way in the drive. AURA five wide in the first
turn, continued outside, backed up in the far turn. MOCHA KISS was finished before a half.
