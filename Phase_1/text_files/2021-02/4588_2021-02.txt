Footnotes
THRU THE VINE attended the pace along the inside, shifted out and took over with three furlongs to run, edged clear through the second turn, widened into
the stretch, was kept to task and held safely. ABUELO NUNO lunged at the start, was away behind his field, tucked in to save ground, moved into
contention before going a half, waited behind runners through the second turn, tipped out into the lane, but toiled through the drive and was unable to
threaten the winner. NEFARIOUS FELLA settled in hand, advanced into striking distance three deep, loomed a danger leaving the quarter pole but flattened
in the final furlong. LEND AMERICA tracked the leader off of the inside for five-eighths, but faltered between rivals before going six furlongs and faded. HAIL
SOUTHERN pulled clear to set the pace to the second turn and succumbed. GATOR BITE was unhurried on the outside and was never a factor.

Footnotes
OX TROT, in touch with the leaders between foes in the opening stages, was rated off the first flight while shifting out racing through the backstretch, was
urged to press the pace three wide racing into the turn, dueled outside a rival to upper stretch and edged clear late under firm right handed encouragement.
TONY SMALL, off a step slowly, was prompted to a contending position inside foes tracking just off the first flight, shifted out racing into upper stretch and
prevailed for the place honors while his rider gathered up his mount nearing the wire. SACRAMENTO Q broke awkwardly to race last away well behind the
field, was settled into stride, steadily regained contention entering the turn, angled out five wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to close
the gap on the top pair while prevailing for a share. FRIENDLY FELLA was rated just off the first flight in the opening stages, split foes to press the pace
between rivals racing into the turn, dueled inside the eventual winner resisting that rival into upper stretch but gave out leaving the furlong marker.
GETTININTOMISCHIEF shifted off the rail in the opening stages disputing the pace inside rivals racing into the turn but came up empty nearing upper
stretch. THREE DEEP settled outside foes off the second flight, was fanned six wide entering the lane and offered no rally. OSKAR BLUES proved no
factor. BETWEENHEREANDCOOL angled inwards while being urged to briefly contest the pace outside a rival, then between foes into the turn but emptied
out after a half. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
MARIANNA QUEEN broke sharply, was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn,
advanced inside foes when presented an opening racing into upper stretch, continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage under right
handed pressure and was taken in hand approaching the wire. INHONOROFOWENJR tracked off the second flight while shifting out three wide racing into
the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path racing into the far turn gaining the advantage, went clear in upper stretch but failed to sustain that
momentum. SUNNYMEDE DREAM, urged to a forward placing along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, was prompted to bid inside that rival racing
into the far turn, shifted out entering upper stretch and faded between foes in the closing stages. KATZ YOU LATER, pinched back out of tight quarters at
the start, settled along the inside and improved position racing into the lane while no real threat. MEANASASNAKE, urged clear racing a bit off the rail to the
backstretch, set the pace in the two path racing to the far turn and gave out entering upper stretch. REYNA DE VERANO was settled outside a rival in the
last flight racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. HONOLUA BAY, urged to a forward placing outside a rival tracking just off the pacesetter in the
opening half, steadily faded between foes racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
ROARING RIVER was prompted to a forward placing outside rivals racing to the first turn, tracked the leaders outside a rival through the backstretch, was
urged three deep between foes on the far turn to challenge for command, continued in a protracted skirmish outside a rival past midstretch but edged
forward late under steady pressure. ROGUE RAGE tracked just off the leaders along the inside, came around a tiring rival racing into the far turn to bid for
command along the rail, grudgingly contested the issue past midstretch but proved only second best. SWEET GIANT tracked off the second flight outside
rivals to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide on the far turn to challenge for command in tandem with the eventual winner but flattened out
in the drive while lasting for a share. SUPER SHOES, off a bit awkwardly, was settled outside foes to the backstretch, shifted five wide racing into the far
turn and continued evenly to the lane. KALININGRAD, held up between foes tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, lacked the needed
closing response. CUP GAME was settled outside a rival in the last flight early, shifted out four wide on the far turn and improved position while proving no
real threat. SYMBOL AZTECA settled along the inside racing to the backstretch and passed some tiring rivals. TOMMY TUESDAY worked his way to the
inside early dropping well off the second flight and faded early. FACTOR MAN, urged between foes to gain terms with the pacesetter, prompted the pace to
the far turn and gave way between foes once headed by the winner. DISTINCTIVE ECHO sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside, dueled for
command into the backstretch and gave way abruptly racing into the far turn.

TOUPHA, reserved outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance five wide into the second bend, steadily advanced four
wide into upper stretch to challenge for command midstretch and went clear under firm hand urging. RITMO DE CUECA (ARG), caught four wide while
being prompted to contend into the first turn, was rated off the first flight outside a rival on the backstretch, was urged to advance four wide racing into the
far turn to challenge for command in upper stretch, couldn't match the winner late but prevailed for the place honors. I AM THAT I AM was rated off the first
flight just off the inside racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail on the far turn while being prompted to advance inside foes and continued with a steady
effort to gain position to the end. SAUCY DEREK, urged to a forward placing just off the leaders along the inside racing into the backstretch, came through
midway through the backstretch nearest the rail to press the issue, edged forward just off the rail racing through the far turn, dueled between foes past
midstretch but was outkicked. U S NAVY CROSS, a bit outpaced in the opening stages, was settled between foes in the last flight, angled inwards racing
into the far turn but had no rally. ALLGORILLA settled inside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. THAT'S
BUCKBEAK, urged to a forward placing three wide attending the pace to the backstretch, was urged to lodge a brief bid in that path nearing the far turn, was
steadied out of tight quarters midway through that bend and quickly gave way. RED CAT (CHI) flashed brief pace three wide between foes racing to the first
turn but faded from contention early. FAIR CATCH, urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, pressed the between foes to the far
turn and was finished early. DA ALPHA WAS FRACTIOUS IN THE GATE, NECESSITATING A LATE SCRATCH AND WAS VANNED OFF THE COURSE.

RIDE INTO THE SKY, urged between foes prompting the pace racing through the backstretch, continued with a steady bid between foes to challenge for
command racing into upper stretch and edged clear late under firm left handed encouragement. UNCLE HAL was urged pressing the pace three wide
between foes in the opening stages, continued in that path racing through the turn and edged a rival for the place honors in late stages. TIZ APPROVED,
restless in the gate before the start, broke in the air while getting away last, was hustled five wide through the backstretch to gain a clear lead racing into the
bend, shifted in on the turn to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage just off the rail racing into upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum while
yielding to the top pair late. ETHAN HUNT was rated off the first flight racing to the turn, gained position between foes while angling inside racing through
the bend, shifted out four wide in the closing stages and lacked the needed final kick. MR LIGHTNING BOY, off slowly, was settled near the inside early,
switched outside rivals on the turn and continued with an effort to gain some position while no real threat. EXECUTIVE DECREE switched out six wide
tracking off the first flight early, made brief pursuit of the leaders five wide into the turn and faded into upper stretch. SUCCESSFUL ROMAN, slow into
stride, angled to the inside racing to the turn but failed to menace. BACK PAGE, urged along the inside prompting the pace in the opening quarter, gave way
early. CALL ME HANDSOME joined the pace four wide in the opening stages but steadily faded racing into the turn.

Footnotes
RED HOOD, urged to a forward placing prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue to gain a clear advantage midway through the
far turn, then steadily widened the margin to late stages while being kept to firm encouragement. STERLING ICE broke sharply, sped to the lead racing a bit
off the rail into the backstretch, proved no match for the winner leaving the midway point of the far turn but continued with interest to prove best of the
others. IT'S ME AGAIN broke awkwardly while shifting inwards making light contact with CHANNEL MAN, was settled between foes in the last flight racing
to the backstretch, angled out four wide gaining momentum nearing upper stretch and edged a rival for a share in the closing stages. DRAMATIC KITTEN,
urged to a forward placing racing a bit off the inside in the opening half, shifted out three wide racing through the far turn to upper stretch and steadily faded.
ELUSIVE ARTY settled inside foes in the last flight to the backstretch and passed only tiring rivals. MONETIZED, urged to a position just off the first flight
racing outside a rival to the backstretch, angled to the inside nearing the far turn and soon gave way. CHANNEL MAN, bumped lightly at the start, shifted
out four wide racing to the backstretch and dropped out early. GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY tracked off the second flight nearest the inside racing to the
backstretch but was through after a half.

CORE VALUES hopped in the air at the start breaking slowly, pulled her way to contention racing four wide through the first turn to gain terms with the first
flight after a half, was urged to press the issue three deep racing into the far turn, wrested the advantage nearing upper stretch and went well clear in the
closing stages while being kept to firm left handed pressure. BABY GUNDIN angled to the inside racing to the first turn while tracking off the first flight, came
through midway through the backstretch when presented an opening to press the pace inside foes, continued to dispute the issue inside the eventual winner
through the far turn, couldn't match that foe racing into the stretch but proved best of the others. MISS ALEX, in touch with the pacesetter between foes
prompting that rival into the backstretch, lost some position to the leaders racing into the far turn, shifted out four wide entering the lane and continued with
interest to prevail for a share. FORBIDDEN DREAM, caught in close quarters racing into the first turn, was settled off the second flight along the inside, was
prompted to advance along the rail racing into the far turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. RACE DAY SPEED tracked
the leaders three wide between foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch and continued evenly. NABRUZZI, caught in tight quarters, then
shuffled back nearest the rail in the opening stages, settled last to the backstretch, swung out five wide nearing the lane but passed only tiring rivals.
PERSEVERANCIA tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, raced in close quarters into the second bend and steadily faded. BEACHSIDE
BUNNY, urged to the lead racing to the first turn while reaming off the rail, dueled between foes through the backstretch to the far turn and gave way
abruptly nearing upper stretch. MOLLIFY, held up between foes in the last flight racing to the first turn, shifted out four wide entering the backstretch and
retreated early.

EFFIEMEISTER, urged to terms with a rival to attend the pace under light rating racing to the backstretch, took over midway through the far turn, shifted
nearer to the inside racing into upper stretch and widened the advantage under left handed pressure. SLEWYS CHOSEN ONE tracked off the first flight
near the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch while being urged to advance but couldn't gain terms with the winner
while proving best of the others. DREAMING OF PARIS broke sharply, dictated the pace off the rail to the backstretch, shifted to the three path nearing the
far turn dueling for command inside the eventual winner and gave way into the stretch. RAZZLEDAZZLEM, off awkwardly, was caught four wide racing
through the first turn while momentarily dropping out last on the backstretch, was prompted to gain position outside foes racing into the far turn to race four
wide into the lane but offered no rally. KELCIE'S MANDATE tracked off the second flight three wide between foes racing to the backstretch but had no
closing response. MAGIC FINNISH angled inwards to track just off the first flight in the three path racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into
the far turn and soon gave way. PEARLS FOR JOSIE angled to the inside in early stages while settling last to the first turn and failed to menace thereafter.
