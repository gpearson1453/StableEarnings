Footnotes
NOKOMIS broke slowly, was content to lag, rallied well out into the track around the turn then quickly ran clear from the outside through the final sixteenth.
MARIAH ALYVIA broke in the air, lacked room along the rail from the half-mile pole until early on the turn, steadied sharply when shut off while rallying
midway on the bend, swung wide into the stretch and finished gamely outside. GOLD TIME VIXEN was never far back, moved to vie three wide between
rivals on the turn, bumped with GRAY LOLLIPOPS entering the stretch then weakened. EIGHT DANZAS moved to a short lead along the inside midway on
the backstretch, came out on the turn and tired. GRAY LOLLIPOPS broke sharply for the early lead, remained prominent two wide around the turn, bumped
with GOLD TIME VIXEN entering the stretch then tired. Post time was delayed 6 minutes after JUST ONE TIME flipped in the gate

Footnotes
CATTLE DRIVE angled to the outside while unhurried early on the backstretch, moved three wide to command midway on the final turn, drew clear
approaching the lane and widened under mild urging. GEMS MINESHAFT RVF lagged inside early, angled two wide for room nearing the stretch while
moving then flattened out in the lane. CLINIC was slow early, raced wide around the final turn and passed tired ones. MONEYBAGS was outrun.
INDIGESTION stayed out from the rail and stopped. WARLEGGAN stayed out form the rail while making the pace into the far turn then stopped. BEST
SURPRISE stumbled badly a few strides out of the gate, was hustled early, stayed close to the front into the far turn, stopped and was eased up.

BUSTIN THE BANK lagged early then made a mild late run. YO NO SE stopped. QUENCH MY THIRST chased early, stopped and was eased up.
MODERN TALE was very slow from the gate and lost contact with the field after five furlongs.
