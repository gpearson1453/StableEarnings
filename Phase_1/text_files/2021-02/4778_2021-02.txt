NOT ORBINARY angled to the rail racing to the first turn stalking just inside the leaders racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide leaving the midway
point of the far turn while advancing to challenge, took over midstretch and went clear under firm encouragement. HOLY DIVER, urged to the lead dictating
the pace on a narrow margin a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, dueled inside foes on the far turn but proved no match for the winner in the drive.
SAPPHIRE JUBILEE was rated just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled four wide nearing upper stretch and continued well enough to
edge a rival for a share. BABIE MONSTER, forwardly placed between foes prompting the pacesetter, moved to terms pressing that rival on the far turn but
came up empty in the drive. DO WHAT IT TAKES vied with the leaders three wide between foes to the backstretch and steadily faded on the far turn. WEST
HORIZEN threw her head while hopping at the start, was quickly righted, then urged four wide to the backstretch prompting the leaders but gave way after a
half.

Footnotes
FRANKIE Z was settled between foes racing in the last flight in the opening quarter, commenced a steady gain three deep between foes nearing upper
stretch, bid inside the pacesetter leaving midstretch and wrested the advantage from that foe in time under right handed pressure. JUMP BACK JACK joined
the pace three deep racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue on the turn to edge clear racing into upper stretch but was collared nearing the wire.
HE HAS NO FRIENDS, urged between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way midstretch. D TACHYON, cut off
momentarily at the start, was prompted to a position tracking just off the first flight racing into the turn but had no closing bid. ROYAL BIZ, urged to the lead
along the inside, dueled for command to upper stretch and gave way. LIL ANNIE ROSE settled between foes in the last flight early and never gained
contention. LIL GREEN MACHINE was settled inside foes and proved no threat. REINER, bumped, then shuffled back at the start, switched outside rivals
racing through the backstretch but quickly came up empty.

Footnotes
LOVELY TROPHY GIRL, cut off at the start by THE DONNA, was quickly collected to gain a position tracking the leaders as part of the second flight racing
outside a rival to the backstretch, was prompted to make a steady advance on the leader racing through the far turn, wrested the advantage from that foe
midstretch and went clear under firm encouragement. LADY DOMINANCE, reserved off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, was
taken up momentarily when clipping heels entering the far turn, was righted, then urged to split foes three deep nearing upper stretch and continued with a
steady late response to prevail for the place honors between foes nearing the wire. ASTERS D'ORO, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace racing into the
backstretch, went clear momentarily on the far turn but failed to sustain that momentum. EL VALOR, reserved outside foes off the second flight racing to the
backstretch, gained some position three wide between foes nearing upper stretch, then was carried out by C'EST PARTI in the closing stages while being
outfinished for a share. C'EST PARTI angled to the rail tracking the leaders as part of the flight racing to the backstretch, was held up avoiding close
quarters momentarily entering the far turn, switched off the inside nearing upper stretch while being urged in pursuit of the leaders but drifted out leaving
midstretch while impeding a rival in the closing stages. MAY BEAU settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, was fanned five wide into upper stretch
and offered no rally. PRAY FOR RAIN, reluctant to load, settled near the inside early and failed to menace. LADY CHITU was urged to the lead while
angling to the inside leaving the chute, dueled for command inside a rival racing to the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. AWESOME GAP was rated
stalking just off the first flight racing to the far turn and gave way abruptly between foes nearing the lane. THE DONNA ducked inwards at the start crossing
over the path of the eventual winner, was righted to make brief pursuit of the leaders, bore out racing through the first turn and quickly emptied out.
FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE FAR TURN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
CANDY COVE, urged to the lead shifting off the rail racing into the first turn, disputed the pace on a narrow advantage inside a rival to the far turn, forged
clear leaving the second bend and was kept to firm encouragement. LITTLE MAZZY settled last near the inside racing to the far turn, shifted out splitting
foes four wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors. MY COWBOY, caught four wide racing into the first turn,
pulled his way to terms with the leader prompting that rival through the backstretch but steadily faded on the far turn while continuing well enough to prevail
for a share. PRIZED WARRIOR tracked the leaders three wide between foes as part of the second flight racing to the far turn and faded into upper stretch.
FOURTH DESIGN tracked the pace between foes in second flight and steadily faded nearing the lane. WHISTLE ME HOME tracked the pacesetter nearest
the inside inside foes in second flight in the opening half but retreated racing into the far turn. GRIMGRINNIN' GHOST settled off the second flight outside a
rival racing to the backstretch but dropped out early.

LAKE PARIMA broke readily, conceded the lead to stalk a rival's pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, steadily gained on the leader between foes
to challenge for command in upper stretch, met several challenges leaving midstretch and edged clear under firm encouragement. PRINCESS CORA was
rated along the inside tracking the pacesetter inside the eventual winner, saved ground racing into the far turn, shifted off the inside to bid inside the leader
midstretch but couldn't match that foe in the last furlong. SWEET MOOCHIE was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the far turn, shifted out
racing into upper stretch to bid three deep between foes and finished on even terms with a rival for a share while no match for the top pair. PLAYIN DISCO
hopped at the start, then angled to the inside early, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a mild bid to finish on even terms with a
rival for a share. STAR SWEPT tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, advanced three wide on the far turn to lodge a brief bid
nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the closing stages. ZANDREA'S, reserved while making her way to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved
ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. VOLADOR tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the second bend and came up empty nearing
the lane. EFFIEMEISTER trailed the field to the stretch and made no impression. MOTHERWELL, urged between foes to gain the advantage racing to the
first turn, dictated the pace into the far turn and gave way abruptly racing into upper stretch. CALYPSO KEY dropped back early.

PHASE OUT, reluctant to load prior to the start, sped to the lead while angling inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn, maintained
that advantage to upper stretch and kicked away in the closing stages under firm encouragement. RAASED tracked the leaders three wide in second flight
racing to the turn, then continued with a steady effort in that path to edge a rival for the place honors late. EASY DAY broke sharply, angled inwards
prompting a rival's pace through the backstretch, continued in pursuit of that foe to upper stretch but weakened late. CREATIVE CHOICE shifted inwards in
the opening stages avoiding close quarters while crossing into the path of UP AND ONWARD, tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing into
the turn and continued evenly inside foes in the closing stages while being just outkicked for a share. ISLAND BOY, bumped soundly by RED BARI at the
start, was settled between foes collecting his stride, then continued evenly three wide into the stretch while never gaining contention. UP AND ONWARD,
caught in close quarters at the start, then forced inwards in the opening stages tracking the leaders in second flight, steadily faded racing into the turn. RED
BARI broke outwards bumping ISLAND BOY at the start, then was steadied out of tight quarters early and soon dropped out. GOT FLOFFY proved no
factor.

Footnotes
INDY LYON, pulling against restraint along the inside tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, switched outside
that foe midway through the backstretch, continued with a steady bid to challenge for command on the far turn, edged forward to a clear advantage racing
into upper stretch and held THRU THE VINE on a safe margin to the end under pressure. The latter angled to the inside racing to the first turn gaining a
position just off the second flight, steadily advance to contention nearing the far turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch to advance between foes and
continued willingly to close the gap while failing to gain even terms with the winner. QUANTUM VELOCITY, held up along the inside avoiding tight quarters
racing into the backstretch, switched outside foes after a half, steadily gained contention three wide nearing upper stretch but flattened out while shifting
inwards entering the lane while prevailing for a share. FORMAL TREASURE, reserved between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, improved
position between foes into upper stretch. FREELANCE, prompted to gain a position in the second flight, drifted wide into the first turn, continued three deep
on the backstretch, raced four wide into upper stretch and had no rally. HIGHLY NOTED, urged to gain the lead along the inside leaving the chute, set the
pace on a clear margin racing to the far turn and gave way once headed by the winner nearing upper stretch. DYNAMORE settled outside foes in the last
flight racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. KICK IT CHARLIE was a brief factor between foes in the second flight but retreated early. HOPE LADY
dropped out early.

Footnotes
SNIPER SIS, forwardly placed three deep tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, moved to wrest the advantage
from that foe midway through the far turn, went clear into upper stretch and held sway on a safe margin to the end under mild hand urging. MARIALUISA
tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, gained on the leaders three wide on the far turn, shifted to the inside entering the stretch
while continuing in pursuit of the winner but was only second best. MARIANNA QUEEN angled to the inside tracking off the second flight, continued
between foes into the far turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and prevailed for a share late while proving no threat to the top pair. VANA
GRAND settled inside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance after a half, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late
response. CAPTUREMENOW settled outside foes to the backstretch and and passed between some tiring rivals late while never proving a serious threat.
KAUFY FUTURES sprinted to the lead along the inside, set the pace on a clear margin to the far turn and gave out abruptly once headed by the winner.
DREAMINOFDASIES settled between foes in the last flight, was fanned six wide into the stretch and proved no threat. MY BLONDE MARY, forwardly
placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter, emptied out racing into the far turn. HONESTA trailed throughout.
