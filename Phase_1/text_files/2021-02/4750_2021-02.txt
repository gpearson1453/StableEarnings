Footnotes
PAYNTER FEST, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the first turn, switched out entering the backstretch to gain a
position just outside the pacesetter, pressed the issue racing through the far turn, went clear under firm left handed pressure and was taken in hand nearing
the wire once the issue was decided. ALEXBABE settled into stride dropping off the leaders racing to the first turn, split rivals steadily gaining position on the
far turn and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors in the drive. BAHAMA KITTEN tracked off the first flight between foes, shifted three
wide on the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path on the far turn but couldn't gain terms with the winner and was outkicked for second.
LAPULGA, off slowly, settled last to the far turn, then split foes while shifting out four wide late to gain position in a belated effort. PATIENT DIGNA tracked
off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, was fanned five wide into the lane but had no rally. FOXY LADY, urged to the lead outside a rival,
angled to the inside once gaining the advantage setting the pace on a narrow margin, dueled for command inside the eventual winner racing through the far
turn and gave way in upper stretch. BERBERSLILBRIEBRIE, urged prompting the pace inside a rival racing to the first turn, conceded the lead to track just
off that foe into the backstretch but steadily faded entering the far turn.

Footnotes
SOUP AND SANDWICH, held up avoiding tight quarters near the inside just after the start, stalked the pacesetter inside a rival under light rating racing to
the backstretch, was prompted to advance inside the pacesetter when presented an opening midway through the far turn, quickly wrested a clear advantage
while shifting off the rail on his own courage racing into upper stretch, then came under some left handed pressure while appearing to duck out slightly in the
last furlong but maintained a safe margin while being gathered up approaching the wire. FOREMAN broke readily, angled to the inside dictating the pace on
a narrow margin into the backstretch, was headed from both sides racing into the far turn, but continued with a steady effort to pursue the winner along the
inside to the closing stages. BROADWAY, in touch with the pacesetter in the opening half stalking that rival's pace under light rating, advanced to press the
issue three wide entering the far turn but emptied out abruptly entering upper stretch.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF PARIS pulled her way to the lead while shifting a bit off the rail racing into the backstretch, was headed midway through the backstretch, but
continued to dispute the issue outside a rival in a prolonged skirmish into the stretch, drifted out despite right handed pressure but wrested a narrow
advantage nearing the wire to narrowly prevail. EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE was rated stalking just inside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, advanced
along the rail after a half to press the issue, continued in a protracted skirmish through the far turn past midstretch but just failed to contain the winner.
CLADDAGH'S RUN tracked the leaders between foes just off the second flight in the opening half, angled out to advance four wide between foes on the far
turn, angled to the six path in upper stretch but continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair. SLEWYS CHOSEN ONE tracked just off the first flight
outside a rival to the backstretch, angled to the inside entering the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch to bid for command between foes three deep in the
closing stages but finished evenly. WILD NORTH, reserved outside a rival in the last flight to the backstretch, angled to the inside entering upper stretch and
made some belated progress. KELCIE'S MANDATE, reserved along the inside as part of the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled out to race four
deep between foes entering the stretch but had no rally. DEGREES OF FREEDOM, caught four wide racing through the first turn to the backstretch, steadily
faded nearing the lane. STARSHIP GODDESS tracked off the second flight three wide between foes in the opening half and offered no rally. BROADWAY
PEGGY, forwardly placed outside the eventual winner prompting that rival to the backstretch, continued three deep into the lane while being roused to
advance but emptied out midstretch. BOASTFUL CONTESSA angled to the inside early tracking just off the second flight but steadily faded after a half.

Footnotes
PURPLE PEOPLEEATER, urged inside foes disputing the pace a bit off the rail racing into the turn, was headed nearing upper stretch but came under left
handed pressure to turn back the challenge of RUN AWESOME TIZ and edge clear of that foe in the closing stages. The latter joined the pace in the four
path soon after the start, pressed the issue outside the eventual winner past midstretch but proved no match in the final stages. GRANDMARY tracked off
the first flight outside foes racing to the turn and continued evenly four wide into the stretch to prevail for a share. TETON THAI tracked off the second flight
along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but had no final bid. BLAZING DIVA settled along the inside early but passed only tiring rivals. I AM A.
LURING, urged three wide between foes prompting the pace racing to the turn, emptied out early. RUN SNIP RUN angled inwards tracking off the first flight
racing to the turn but steadily faded into the lane.

CLASSY WOMAN broke sharply, angled inwards dictating the pace racing to the backstretch, widened the margin entering the far turn and held sway to the
end under firm encouragement. CURLY RUTH was rated off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, shifted out three wide on the far turn
commencing a steady advance, then moved to close the gap on the winner late while narrowly edging a rival for the place honors. A K'S SONG, reserved
along the inside in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance splitting foes racing through the far turn, angled to the rail entering the
lane while continuing with interest inside foes to just miss for second. LADY FATIMA, forwardly placed stalking a rival's pace racing to the far turn,
weakened between foes late. BRASSY was rated inside foes off the second flight racing to the far turn but offered no rally. HERE COMES JACKIE tracked
the pace inside foes in second flight and steadily faded nearing the lane. LADY CLOVERLY, reserved outside a rival in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, offered no rally. DON'T BLAME JUDY, reserved three deep off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was caught four wide entering the far
turn and had no closing bid. MARYNMIKE tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight to the backstretch and faded after a half.

STRUM AND PLUCK, urged inside rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, edged clear racing into the far turn, then held sway
racing a bit off the rail to late stages under steady pressure. SWEET GIANT was rated along the inside stalking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch,
briefly awaited an opening nearing the far turn, switched outside the pacesetter to challenge on the far turn while advancing to challenge but proved only
second best. ROGUE RAGE, caught a bit wide racing into the first turn, tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, angled inwards splitting
foes to challenge inside the leaders racing into the stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. BELLAMY'S TREASURE, reserved between foes to the
backstretch, angled to the inside racing into the stretch and made an effort to improve position. ODESSA GOLD, brushed at the break, was held up along
the inside racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. SALLY'S SALUTE tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch and faded
racing into the far turn. KHOZANITO, urged prompting the eventual winner's pace racing to the backstretch, continued in pursuit into the far turn and gave
way nearing upper stretch. TOMMY TUESDAY reared at the start while breaking slowly and trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
THE CRITICAL WAY was urged to lead along the inside disputing the pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn, edged forward to a clear advantage
midstretch and held IMPRIMIS gamely to the end under right handed pressure. The latter tracked off the first flight nearest the inside under light reserve
racing into the bend, was prompted to advance along the rail when presented an opening nearing midstretch but proved only second best. THE
CONNECTOR, caught in close quarters three deep between foes and taken up nearing the turn, angled to the inside on the bend and continued with
interest inside foes to gain position to the end while prevailing for a share. TURNED ASIDE joined the pace outside a rival racing through the opening
stages into the turn, pressed the issue to midstretch and gave way. JAZZY TIMES, caught four wide tracking off the first flight racing into the turn, was
fanned five wide in the closing stages while being just outkicked for a share. TENCH tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the turn, shifted three
wide nearing upper stretch but came empty leaving the furlong marker. FOX ROX broke slowly when his head was turned prior to the start losing position to
the field at the start and never gained contention. QUARKY angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes, steadied sharply avoiding tight quarters
racing into the turn and quickly dropped out. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO
ACTION.

Footnotes
WAR GIANT, brushed at the break, was held up off the second flight racing to the turn, shifted out five wide leaving the midway point of the bend while
being prompted to advance, shifted inwards under pressure racing past midstretch while advancing to challenge and wrested a narrow advantage in time.
PAPAJUDGY was urged to gain the lead just after the break racing a bit off the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, dueled for command
inside a rival into upper stretch, couldn't contain the winner late but proved best of the others. LEGACY AZTECA, urged between foes pursuing the
pacesetter racing into the turn, gained terms with the leader to press the issue into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick while finishing in hand in
the final stages. INDY RIDE broke readily, tracked just off the pacesetter three wide between foes in second flight to upper stretch but weakened late. OX
TROT, caught four wide tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the turn, steadily faded in late stages. TWIN VALOR broke inwards brushing the eventual
winner, was settled last racing to the turn and failed to menace. SIESTA MOON tracked just off the pacesetter nearest the rail racing into the turn and gave
way into upper stretch. RAOFTHESUN BROKE THROUGH THE GATE BEFORE THE START, NECESSITATING A LATE SCRATCH.

Footnotes
MISS AURAMET, forwardly placed between foes, angled to the inside tracking off the leaders racing into the turn, shifted three wide racing into upper
stretch while steadily advancing to challenge, wrested the advantage nearing the sixteenth marker and held ODE TO JOY safe to the end under firm left
handed encouragement. The latter came through close quarters at the break, was reserved between foes racing to the turn, split rivals four deep in upper
stretch, shifted five wide leaving the furlong marker and was going well late to challenge for command nearing the wire. SETHAMEE STREET settled last
while angling to the inside racing into the turn, split foes just off the inside on the turn, bid three wide between foes leaving midstretch, then challenged
inside the winner late while just outkicked for the place honors. PAYNTDEMBLUESAWAY, urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, dueled
past midstretch but gave out late. THE GREAT KATH tracked off the second flight inside rivals, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed final
kick. JEANIE B (GB) angled inwards to track three deep between foes off the second flight racing to the turn, was fanned six wide in the closing stages
losing position nearing midstretch but continued evenly to regain some position late. THE GODDESS LYSSA, urged to the lead along the inside disputing
the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, gave way leaving midstretch. ROYAL COLLECTION tracked the leaders between foes off the second
flight to upper stretch and faded in late stages. LENZI'S LUCKY LADY, forwardly placed four wide early, tracked the leaders as part of the second flight
racing into the turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. ROMAN D'ORO, caught five wide, then four wide racing into the turn, proved no threat.
BLUEFIELD, pinched back out of tight quarters at the start, dropped out early. WEEKEND FUN angled to the inside in the opening stages but soon
retreated.
