REMNANT was quick to begin to set all the pace and prevailed late while racing just off the inside under all out pressure. DISTINCT FLIRT pressed the
pace from the inside and made a good rail bid through the stretch to just miss. HALEYS HEIST stalked the pace, raced four wide a the eighth pole and kept
on to the wire. DREAMING ABOUT YOU dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. COUNTESS ST MICHEL raced
three wide in the lane and had no response. CAT WALTZ was slow early and never threatened. Official race time was hand timed.

Footnotes
HIGH ESTEEM set all the pace from the inside and held gamely to be clear under steady handling. HORSE FLY stalked the pace, moved up three wide at
the eighth pole and finished second best. GONE PREACHIN stalked the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. BEAR TRAPPE
settled off the early pace, raced three wide in the stretch and had not enough. DOMINANTE was slow early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and
never threatened. ASTUTE WARRIOR dropped back early on and failed to respond. FULKERSON raced up close early on along the inside and failed to
sustain a bid. Official race time was hand timed.
