CINDERELLAS PRINCE was outsprinted to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch then rallied widest in the drive and was up to tag BOLD ROMAN in the
final jump. BOLD ROMAN stalked the pace to the turn, bid three wide to engage for the lead into the stretch, pushed away to mid stretch then was nailed on
the wire. FIRE WHEN READY had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch then closed steadily but too late. GLORY CALL hustled to contest the pace,
saved ground to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. ROCK SLINGER chased the pace from the rail to the stretch but came p empty
in the drive. RIVER NORTH pressed the pace two wide to the stretch then was also outrun to mid stretch and gave way.

LUCK IS MY NAME never far back to the second turn, rallied three wide to get on terms with the runnerup, outkicked that one to mid stretch and held
driving. AL MILLON BOB set the pace three then two wide to the half, remained off the rail on the second turn, was hooked into the stretch then was tiring
late but saved the place. BELHAM had no speed, got fanned four wide on the second turn, was outrun to mid stretch but was closing the gap late.
WHISPERING FLAME tracked the pace to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch then kept to task in the final furlong. QUAZE VIPER also had no
speed, bid two then three wide to the stretch and was gaining belatedly in the late stages.

KODIACTION was well placed to the second turn, came off the rail and followed SLEEP OVER into the stretch, could not split rivals in upper stretch so
shifted back inside, rallied to the front and edged away driving. SLEEP OVER set the pace to the second turn, was off the rail to the stretch, got collared in
mid stretch but gamely held off SOONER THAT SOONER for second. SOONER THAN SOONER pressed the runnerup to the second turn, was three wide
to the stretch, rallied to mid stretch to loom a threat but was tiring late. KOKO'S MOM was allowed to settle for five furlongs then was two wide on the
second turn but came up empty in the drive. DI LAURIAN had no speed and was never a threat. SHINE LIGHT AUTISM gave a dull effort.

MISS INDEFATIGABLE broke clear and was quickly in front, set all t he pace while saving ground to the stretch then responded when set down and held
driving. CREATIVE ROMANCE pressed the winner throughout in the two path but could not make an impact. HAL'S BUDDY trailed early, settled to the
second turn, swung out four wide to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch then flattened. LADY BREXIT tracked the winner to the half, was three wide
into the second turn then was forced five wide into the stretch and did not rally. CASINO GAMES had no speed, settled to the second turn, angled out six
deep into the stretch and also lacked a closing response.

A REAL HERO was unhurried to the second turn, swung out from the three path to the five path into the stretch, rallied when set down, got to terms in mid
stretch then dug in determinedly to prevail. TWICE THE PRICE stalked the pace to the second turn, came two then three wide to the stretch, rallied to get
on terms in mid stretch but could not stay with the winner late. ME B BUBBA T set the pace while well off the rail to the second turn, was two wide to the
stretch then was overtaken in mid stretch and outfinished. THEULTIMATEPRAISE trailed to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then shifted in
but finished evenly along the rail. ARMA D'ORO pressed the pace to the half, bid four wide to engage for the lead on the second turn, dueled into the stretch
then was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
GALWALKSINTOABAR stalked the leaders early, rallied four wide to get on terms into the stretch, pushed away to mid stretch and remained clear driving.
RUNNIN DIVA had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch, could not impact the winner but surged late to nail SIMPLY PERFECT for second. SIMPLY
PERFECT attended the pace to the turn, inched clear to the stretch then was overtaken by the winner, weakened and was tagged on the line for the place.
STARZA chased the leaders, shifted in nearing the stretch then failed to rally along the rail. MERGIE TROID hustled early, was a pace factor to the turn
then was outkicked to the stretch and tired.

AFTER SUNDOWN stalked the pace to the turn, was four wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms in mid stretch then took over leaving the furlong
grounds but was all out to hold. CROOKHAVEN LASS chased the pace off the rail, was caught in traffic at the quarter pole, waited to inside the three
sixteenths then tried to split rivals in mid stretch, again had to check and angle out then closed furiously but too late. MIA SOLINA attended the pace three
wide to the stretch, stayed on determinedly to inside the eighth pole then was outfinished. PACIFIC SILENCE hustled to contest the pace, raced two wide to
the stretch, stayed on willingly to mid stretch then also got outkicked late. GREY ABBEY was outsprnted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but lacked
the needed late response. SWEET TOPPER chased the leaders three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing bid. FRENCH TUDOR had no speed and was
not a factor.
