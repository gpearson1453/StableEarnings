Footnotes
THORN saved ground for six furlongs, switched out two wide at the top of the stretch, caught EAMONN from outside a furlong out, jumped back to his left
lead and was all out to prevail. EAMONN vied outside ONE MOST WANTED early, cleared off and moved inside for the run up the backstretch, dug in when
challenged by THORN turning for home, and fought gamely on the rail to the finish. ESPECIALLEA saved ground under a firm hold around the first turn,
came off the inside at the top of the lane, and rallied mildly to clearly best the remainder. COMMAND CENTRAL stayed in range two then three wide for six
furlongs, and tired. COUCH DREAMS was no threat two wide. DECLAREATRUCE broke a step slowly, and was outrun inside. CASH KID broke a couple
lengths slow, and was always outrun. ONE MOST WANTED vied early inside EAMONN, let that one go and moved out to chase up the backstretch, came
under a ride on the far turn and was empty nearing the lane. RUN-UP DISTANCE UNAVAILABLE.

PICKING UP PENNIES set the pace in the two path and widened under a drive. CONVERTER prompted the winner in the three path and was clearly
second best. COTTON JIM was shut off at the start, moved up four wide around the turn and was no threat in the lane. SANDY DUDE veered in at the start,
saved ground off the pace, angled out near the quarter pole and passed tiring rivals. AWESOME FAMILY had some speed four wide and was through after
a half. LIL CROWN had brief speed inside.

Footnotes
MAKISUPA (GB) saved ground in easy striking range for six furlongs, switched out to the three-path at the top of the stretch, responded readily to overhaul
LA RUSIA from outside entering the final furlong, and drew away under a mild drive. LA RUSIA established a slow pace inside, could not handle the winner
past the eighth-pole, but held well for the place. ALLEY TO CALVARY pressed the pace outside LA RUSIA to the stretch, and was outkicked. TAILADIOS
settled in the middle of the field for six furlongs, and lacked the needed late response. MI KARLITA broke slowly, lagged near the back to the stretch, and
passed tired horses. BLUES SONGS bumped with BOATLOADOFNERVE at the start, and was no factor inside. BOATLOADOFNERVE bumped with
BLUES SONGS at the start, and was outrun three wide. ROONEY raced three then four wide around the far turn, and tired into the stretch.

Footnotes
BOW BOW GIRL set a pressured pace along the rail, was briefly headed near the three-eighths pole, kicked clear turning for home and drew off under a
drive. SALIT prompted the pace three wide, reached near even terms midway around the far turn, could not match strides with the winner nearing the lane,
continued on the left lead through the stretch and stayed on to be clearly second best. PHAROAH'S BELLE pressed the winner two wide between foes,
briefly led near the three-eighths marker and weakened under a drive nearing the lane. VIVA LA RED stalked the pace inside and faded in the drive. WOW
angled in midway around the first turn and played no factor. BETTER WHISPER steadied while rank around the first turn, dropped back around the far turn,
was pulled up in upper stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
DON'T GET KHOZY saved ground for six furlongs, was guided out three wide at the top of the stretch, caught SKY CHASER and CHARGE ACCOUNT
from outside past the furlong marker and drove clear. SKY CHASER vied inside ELUSIVE MOLLY to the turn, got the best of that one while being joined
from outside by CHARGE ACCOUNT coming to the quarter-pole, battled back inside and prevailed for the place. CHARGE ACCOUNT ranged up three
wide to reach even terms outside SKY CHASER after six furlongs, weakened between horses in deep stretch and yielded second. LAVI stayed close early,
swung four wide leaving the turn and faded. ELUSIVE MOLLY alternated for the lead outside SKY CHASER to the turn, and gave way approaching the
stretch. CHEZ PAREE showed little at the rear.

Footnotes
ZERO GRAVITY trailed inside early, advanced three wide around the far turn, swung six wide turning for home, closed down the center of the track, seized
command near the sixteenth pole and powered clear. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN was reluctant to load, was off slow, raced off the pace two wide through the
opening half, advanced four wide around the far turn, rallied inside of the winner, was no match for that foe and was up for the place late. FINANCIAL
SYSTEM was washy pre-race, set the pace along the rail, led to the sixteenth pole and held for the show. FARLEY was in range three wide, bid three deep
around the far turn, reached near even terms approaching the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and was outfinished between foes. JUST
THE FACTS saved ground in range rounding the first turn, dropped back inside, tipped out nearing the lane and passed some tiring rivals. GEARHEAD
saved ground in midpack, went two wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. BATTLE OF BLENHEIM had some early speed two wide and faded inside
around the far turn. DIDNT DO IT stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
TEXTPECTATION bumped with MR. CESCO at the start, lagged well back for a half-mile, moved swiftly to contention around the turn four wide, collared
TONS OF GOLD from outside in upper stretch and drew clear, and was geared down 70 yards out. TONS OF GOLD chased after FLAMING HOT early,
overhauled that one coming to the quarter-pole three wide, proved no match for the winner into the lane but was clearly second best. FLAMING HOT broke
out bumping MR. CESCO, set the pace inside, lost the advantage after six furlongs and weakened. SAGE CANYON lacked a rally two wide. RAGS FOR
BRITCHES stayed in range early inside, and tired after six furlongs. RED FOG was no factor inside. MEMORABLE raced forwardly two to three wide, and
gave way before reaching the stretch. MR. CESCO hopped slightly at the break, then was bumped between FLAMING HOT and TEXTPECTATION and
shut off, and was far back throughout.

SLAM DUNK pressed the pace outside, took over from AZIZA after a half-mile and kicked clear into the stretch, faced a challenge from DON'T CALL ME
MARY on her inner flank through the last sixteenth of a mile, and had just enough to hold on. DON'T CALL ME MARY raced close up toward the inside for a
half, shifted to the two-path between horses turning for home, rallied along the rail past the furlong marker and was getting to the winner too late.
HEIRESSINDY raced three then four wide around the turn, finished one-paced and was best of the others. PUPPET MASTER bumped with ADDILYN at the
start, was outsprinted early, went three then four wide around the turn, and could not reach contention. AZIZA set a pressured pace inside for a half, and
gave way. ADDILYN bumped with PUPPET MASTER at the start, and was outrun.

APRECIADO settled two wide in midpack, angled four wide near the quarter pole, closed outside under confident handling and was up in the final strides.
CUESTION DE TIEMPO set the pace along the rail, shrugged off a bid turning for home, kicked clear in upper stretch and led to deep stretch. TUSK stalked
the pace three wide, bid three deep near the quarter pole and flattened out in the lane. REMEMBER THE MAINE went evenly inside. OUTSHINE pressed
the pace two wide and weakened in the lane. BURN THE BOATS was hard held between rivals through the opening half, raced three wide around both
turns and never threatened. FADE AWAY played no factor while racing two wide. ANOTHER was rank around the first turn, raced four wide throughout and
failed to menace. MAJESTIC LUNA was outrun inside.

Footnotes
SELFMADE settled in the middle of the field early, stalled in traffic three wide at the top of the stretch, altered course to the two-path for clearance coming to
the furlong grounds, finished gamely and was along in time inside rivals. CUY went along in the second flight for a half-mile, rallied three then four wide
around the far turn, reached a short lead outside GUN OF GLORY in mid stretch, and was edged out late. GUN OF GLORY tracked the leaders three wide,
rallied to the front near the quarter-pole, maintained the advantage through upper stretch, then was outkicked from both flanks. MAJORITY RULES broke a
step slow and was outrun early, came four wide off the far turn and finished willingly on his left lead. FEELING DANGEROUS broke a bit slow and saved
ground well off the early pace, shifted out three wide nearing the stretch, and improved position without seriously menacing. MAGICAL CAUSE broke
slowly, was strung out four to five wide around the far turn, and made no appreciable headway. BLOKE became rank inside while being outrun to the lead
entering the first turn, moved out to chase HARD ASTRAY up the backstretch, and had nothing left for the drive. JOYFUL SURPRISE saved ground in
range to the far turn, was steadied getting shuffled back a quarter-mile out, continued to lack room behind a tiring HARD ASTRAY into the stretch, and could
not recover. HARD ASTRAY sprinted clear early, came under attack from a host of challengers approaching the stretch, and folded up. RUN-UP DISTANCE
UNAVAILABLE.
