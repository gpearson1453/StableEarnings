Footnotes
V. I. P. WHO was rated off the first flight while shifting to the two path racing through the backstretch, angled four wide entering upper stretch and wrested
the advantage from MOONLIGHT GRAHAM in time under firm handling. The latter angled inwards in the opening stages to prompt the pace three wide
racing into the turn, edged forward into upper stretch but was collared nearing the wire. HIGHTIME VALENTINE, caught five wide in early stages, improved
position outside foes in the closing stages to prevail for a share. HEATHER'S GOLD, urged between foes dictating the pace on a narrow margin to upper
stretch, gave way in late stages. ALWAYS SPECIAL, urged inside foes prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way in late stages.
TICKET TO ALASKA shifted out to race four wide between foes in the opening stages, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
BIG BAD DIVA was prompted to a forward placing while switching outside the pacesetter racing into the first turn stalking that rival, advanced readily to take
command midway through the far turn, shifted out to the four path nearing upper stretch while being roused to turn back a rival's challenge, went clear into
upper stretch and widened late under steady pressure. BE LIKE WATER tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, shifted three wide on the far turn
to challenge the pacesetter nearing upper stretch but couldn't gain terms with that foe while prevailing for the place honors. TIZ AMERICAN, caught four
wide racing to the backstretch while part of the second flight, advanced three deep into the second bend, angled inside the leaders nearing upper stretch
and lacked the needed final bid. EVENTIDE (FR), urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and gave way
once headed by the winner. VARSITY FLYGIRL, off slowly, well settled well off the field racing to the backstretch and proved no threat while shifting out four
wide nearing the lane. I'M A HUGGER was a brief factor three wide between foes tracking the leaders as part of the second flight but steadily faded on the
far turn. ZARELLA angled to the inside early tracking the leaders in second flight but faded after a half.

Footnotes
MARKET was rated inside foes dropping off the second flight in the opening quarter, shifted out nearing the turn while coming under prompting to advance,
then produced a sustained response between foes to wear down MONDAY'S WITH MIKE in time under firm handling. The latter tracked the pacesetter four
deep in second flight on the backstretch, steadily advanced racing into the turn to wrest command leaving the quarter mile marker, opened a comfortable
advantage midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner. T J MUNNINGS was settled off the second flight outside a rival in the opening stages, advanced to
contention four wide into the turn, then to upper stretch and continued with a mild bid while gaining a share. SILVER DOLLAR CITY was hustled up the rail
racing through the backstretch to go clear into the into the turn, but faltered nearing upper stretch. BEACH BANDIT settled last in early stages and failed to
menace thereafter. TEXAS STORM tracked the leaders three wide between foes in early stages and faded racing into the turn. CONGRATS SMOKE made
brief pursuit of the pacesetter between foes in the opening quarter but gave way early.

DON'T MAKE ME BEG, came through close quarters at the break to gain a position between rivals tracking just off the pacesetter, split foes advancing on
the leader nearing upper stretch, was fanned five wide into the stretch, then came under some correction shifting inside the leader in upper stretch to wrest
command and go clear late under firm handling. SPEED SALSA settled off the second flight between foes in the opening quarter, angled to the inside racing
into upper stretch to bid for command inside foes but was outkicked by the winner while proving best of the others. LA WAPA, urged between foes disputing
the pace, shook clear to a comfortable advantage on the turn, drifted wide leaving the quarter mile marker floating out the eventual winner and gave way
late. DIVA DANA, urged to dispute the pace just off the inside racing through the backstretch, gave way between foes nearing the lane. THE ROVING KIND
settled last in early stages and never gained contention. TWINKIESANDTURNIPS ducked out at the start, was prompted in pursuit of the leaders four wide
racing into the turn and emptied out early. BONSAI BENNY tracked the leaders along the rail in the opening stages but faded early.

Footnotes
TRUE ATKA, caught in close quarters between tracking just off the leaders racing through the backstretch, shifted out four wide leaving the midway point of
the turn steadily advancing on the pacesetter, then took over from that foe in late stages under firm right handed pressure and was taken in hand in the final
strides once clear. LADY JEAN, forwardly placed three wide between foes, shifted out of the close quarters after the opening quarter to advance on the
leaders three deep on the turn, gained a clear advantage racing into upper stretch but proved only second best when confronted by the winner. LOVIELEE
was urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn and weakened leaving midstretch. MAJESTIC QUEEN angled to the inside
racing through the backstretch tracking the leaders in second flight, shifted out four wide entering the lane and continued evenly late. MOON EYES, off
slowly, switched outside rivals racing through the backstretch, was fanned five wide racing into the stretch but had no closing response. MISS MARGARET
ANN ducked out at the start, was righted, then angled inwards racing through the backstretch forcing the pace outside a rival into the turn and gave way
between foes nearing upper stretch. ALAFIA dropped out early.

PASSION'S IMAGE was rated at the rear of the field along the inside racing through the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing nearest the rail
entering the turn, switched off the inside once gaining the advantage entering upper stretch and widened her margin late under firm right handed
encouragement. BUSTIN HEARTS tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, angled to the
rail approaching the three sixteenths marker to bid inside the winner entering the stretch but proved only second best. LIGHTS DOWN LOW tracked the
leaders outside rivals as part of the second flight on the backstretch, was prompted to advance while caught five wide racing through the turn to upper
stretch but continued well enough to edge a rival for a share late. NOBLE INTENTIONS angled inwards tracking just off the leaders racing through the
backstretch, bid between foes just off the rail entering the turn but weakened in the drive while being taken in hand in the final strides. OPPENHEIMER,
outpaced in early stages, proved no threat. U KNOW I B LION was urged to dispute the pace inside a rival while shifting to the three path racing through the
backstretch, dueled for command in that path between foes entering the turn and gave way after a half. TALE OF V K was urged forcing the pace outside a
rival through the backstretch, was caught four wide between foes entering the turn and came up empty after a half.

LITIGANT broke readily to gain terms with a rival prompting the pace, conceded the lead racing through the backstretch while switching outside the leader
attending the pace racing to the turn, continued with a steady bid to wrest command leaving midstretch and went clear late under firm encouragement.
GRAN CASIQUE, urged to the lead outside a rival in the opening stages, set the pace on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the rail into the turn, dueled for
command to midstretch but proved no match late. FIRST DEGREE tracked the leaders four wide in second flight racing to the turn, then continued willingly
three deep between foes in the closing stages to narrowly prevail for a share. AIN'T WASTING TIME tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second
flight, shifted out nearing upper stretch to bid three, then four deep between foes and was just outkicked for a share. SHAKEM N BREAKEM settled
between foes in the last flight racing to the turn, shifted out five wide entering upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. CHINOMADITO
settled last racing to the turn, split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch and gained some position in a belated effort. DEBDURITE settled
between foes in the last flight racing to the turn and never gained contention. IMPERIAL IVOR tracked the leaders between foes in second flight through the
backstretch, angled inside on the turn while being prompted to advance but faded in the drive. INDIAN BUZZ, under pressure between foes in second flight
early, soon gave way. ST JOE VIPER, caught tracking off the second flight racing to the turn, steadily faded entering the bend.

Footnotes
KALEIDOSCOPE KID tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to make a steady gain between foes nearing the
far turn, shifted to the rail to bid for command inside the pacesetter nearing upper stretch, then went well clear under firm encouragement. IRISH MAJOR,
off last, settled off the second flight, split foes racing into the far turn steadily gaining position, shifted to the inside nearing upper stretch and prevailed for the
place honors while never threatening the winner. MALIO'S gained a position leading the second flight from between foes from out of striking distance to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance in tandem with the eventual winner shifting three wide on the far turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and
lacked the needed late kick while edging a rival for a share. BACK PAGE was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the backstretch, went clear
after a half, held sway through the far turn, then weakened between foes once headed by the winner. UNSPOILED MOMENTS settled last racing to the
backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch and improved his position three deep between foes in a belated effort. DAKOTA'S DUDE tracked the leaders
inside rivals in second flight, came around a tiring foe on the far turn to bid inside rivals in the stretch but lacked the needed closing bid. ETHAN HUNT
tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight racing to the backstretch, was caught four wide racing into the far turn and steadily faded into the lane. MY
DISCRETION, urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset into the backstretch, emptied out early.

Footnotes
HIMELSTEIN ducked inwards at the start momentarily cutting off rivals, was urged along the rail pressing a rival's pace racing through the backstrech into
the turn, edged clear midstretch and held PACHI safe to the end under strong handling. The latter gained a forward placing three deep tracking just off the
first flight, steadily advanced on the winner in that path into the stretch and continued willingly to close the gap. ERIN GO BRAUGH tracked off the first flight
along the inside racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and finished evenly late. REACTION TIME broke sharply, forced the pace outside the
eventual winner through the backstretch into the turn and weakened in late stages. DENY broke in the air while getting away slowly, was caught five wide
racing to the turn, then to upper stretch but gained some position in an even effort. LUCA DREW THE ACE, urged along four wide pursuing the leaders into
the turn, faded racing into upper stretch. JUST LIKE DUNCAN tracked off the second flight four wide between foes racing to the turn and lacked a closing
response. JUPI'SRESURRECTION, cut off at the start while breaking slowly, settled last to the turn and never seriously menaced. CLEAR WONDER
proved no factor. DR. ALBERT, caught in tight quarters at the start, was prompted in brief pursuit of the leaders between foes racing to the turn but faded
early.
