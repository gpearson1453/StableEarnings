Footnotes
VICTORY TRIP was bumped at the break, vied for the early lead, pulled away and finished well. MUCHO MARVIN broke out, bobbled, raced near the back,
made a steady gain and was clearly second at the wire. KENSLEY'S HIPPIE pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn and proved no match for the
top two. PAT ME DOWN raced near the middle of the field, came around the turn five wide, made a bid and was outfinished for third. COMBAT COMMAND
raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn and lacked a finish. CRYPTOZONIC raced evenly near the back, came around the turn four
wide and was never a factor. CHASIN GRACIE vied for the early advantage and faded. IPIDATE broke slow and was never close. PICACHO PEAK raced
near the middle of the field in the beginning and retreated to the rear.

Footnotes
PADDOCK PICK went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and finished well. TOP DRAW pressed the pace, followed PADDOCK PICK around the track
and proved second best. NIPPY RED raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn and proved no match for the top two. BIG BOY DAVE
REX unhurried, racing in the back, made a steady gain, but was no real threat. LIGHTHAWK raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort.
TAKE THAT FOR DATA lacked early speed, raced four wide around the final turn and was never a factor. MUSCADINE void of early speed, raced five wide
around the second turn and was never a threat. CHARLIES TICKET pressed the early pace, saved ground around the final turn and was finished early.
GREAT lacked early speed and was outrun.
