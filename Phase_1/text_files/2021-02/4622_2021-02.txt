PASSIONATE REWARD was a bit tardy to begin, pushed up to stalk the leader two wide to the stretch, responded when roused and closed steadily to
collar his stablemate. SUNRISE JOURNEY hustled to duel for the lead while off the rail to the stretch, battled to mid stretch, inched away from
CARTELLATE nearing the sixteenth marker but could not hold off the winner. REGAL BORN had no speed, was three wide into the turn, swung out five
deep into the stretch then finished in a rally. COLORMEMONEY was outsprinted to the turn, got fanned out to the five path while in front of REGAL BORN,
tried to make an impact but could not. CARTELLATE was used early to contest the pace three wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then was tiring
late. CONCENSUS had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response. CARTOONIST stalked the pace outside the winner, was
three then four wide to the stretch but also tired in the drive.

Footnotes
BLUSHING BAY settled mid pack to the half, bid four wide on the second turn, rallied when set down for the drive and wore down INDIAN DANCER late.
TOTALLY NORMAL had no speed, settled to the second turn then was outside the winner and five deep to the stretch then closed steadily late to get the
nod for second. INDIAN DANCER stalked the leader to the second turn, rallied three wide to take over, responded to mid stretch then could not stall the
winner and was tagged for second. LUCKY MS JONES was also settled for a half mile, saved ground on the second turn then shifted out in upper stretch
and finished willingly. SENORITA ESTRELLA was chasing the pacesetter to the second turn, saved ground and bid inside to loom a threat into the stretch
but got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. BORN TO REIGN raced unhurried to the second turn then offered her best bid three wide, was a threat into
the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. URBAN DIVA sped clear, led for five furlongs then tired and stopped in the stretch.

UNION DANCE was unhurried to the second turn, bid three wide then shifted out widest for the drive, rallied and closed steadily to win going away.
ALVAARO set the pace to the second turn, turned back rivals and inched away to mid stretch then could not stall the winner but saved the place.
MECKLENBURG (IRE) was stalking outside rivals to the second turn, bid three then four wide and loomed boldly into the stretch but got outkicked to mid
stretch and finished evenly. HUGE BIGLY trailed to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. GALLANT
WARREN had no speed, raced two wide throughout but also did not rally. MEGAMEISTER pressed the runnerup for five furlongs, bid two wide while
between rivals to loom a threat into the stretch but was outkicked and tired. EXETER saved ground but was never a threat and gave way in the stretch.
