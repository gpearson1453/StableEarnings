Footnotes
HAKMAN tracked evenly through the turn emerging to loom at mid track in upper stretch hooking rival late getting up in the last strides. QUALITY MAN
stalked the pace rallying to draw even in upper stretch taking the lead to deep stretch ceding grudgingly to outside pressure at the wire. NEVUS hustled
along came three wide down the lane responding under heavy urging. KINGDOM DIAMOND pressed then chased saving ground to upper stretch extending
along the rail weakening late. IT'S A MANS WORLD set the pace to upper stretch dueling on the inside wearing out late. THE MAN CAN played no factor.
BLUE MONARCH was never involved. TROMBONE EASTON was always outrun.
