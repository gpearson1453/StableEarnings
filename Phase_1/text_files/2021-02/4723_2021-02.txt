MARKET ALERT away without apparent mishap, prompted the pace from path two, went about his business while being hand urged on the turn, not briskly
so however, appeared to poke a head down in front as the half was being rattled off, got roused settling onto the head of the stretch, gradually edged away
from a very pesky opponent down the stretch to prove best. THE KING CHEEK cemented itself to the front end after being on the receiving end of a brisk
hand ride, showed the way from along the inside route, tailed by eventual winner one path farther to the outside, was put to a drive for the drive home, got
headed, battled back hard but couldn't re-claim the advantage. STORM SHOOTER pursued the pace three wide, was in the same path spinning into the
lane, stayed on for the show. HORN OF PLENTY spotted along the rail, was seen pulling on the bit for much of the journey leading up to the conclusion of
the backstretch, appeared to go about the turn much more professionally afterwards, rider applying a snug hold, crept up to the front runners, waited behind
the others during the last few jumps on the turn, tipped out into the two path coming into the stretch, had no closing punch. HALPERT off the inside,
travelled two to three wide on the turn, was more the latter at the top of the lane, wound up trailing throughout after having no offering.

BELLAMY DOLCE four then three wide in pursuit, remained patiently handled advancing on the front through the latter portion of the turn, got set down
spinning three wide into upper stretch and took over command straightened away, inched away under a drive kept to task. ANOTHER SHOT hustled from
the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. HUMPDAY dueled
three then two wide with BEDAZZLING to his inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home and was collared in
tandem with his main pace foe by the top one, ran on to secure the show honors. YOU'VE GOT MALE coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until
tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. EIGHT
WEEKS LONG coaxed from the start, grew detached at the tail of the field when devoid of speed early on, chased inside coming under coaxing three
furlongs from home, tipped three wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. BEDAZZLING dueled from the two path with HUMPDAY to his outside,
tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing midway, cut the corner into upper stretch under threat, yielded the front straightened away and tired.
TAPITENA six then five wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, cornered five wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

MINE THE COIN secured a forward position, got guided onto the inside route, rated kindly showing the way, with CLASSY PAPA in accompaniment from
the outside, edged away going about the turn, struck the three-sixteenths pole and was switched over to stronger handling, dug in with good energy to stay
in the clear. NO LIME pinched at the start after being bumped from both sides, took up the chase primarily from the two path, shifted closer to the rail in time
to cut the corner into the stretch, got staved off. BLOOD MOON came in at the start, made contact with second place finisher before getting corrected, raced
at a considerable distance from off the inside throughout, was marooned out in the path six during the run around the bend, flashed interest when let out a
notch springing from the five-sixteenths pole, swung one path closer into the stretch maintained its momentum, failed to make any addition progress on the
top one, then fell short of earning place honors too. SMILE BRYAN stalked the pace from midpack on the backstretch, departed it from the five path,
improved position on the turn, angled towards path six for the stretch run, had no punch. CLASSY PAPA bumped at the start, took up the chase from path
three, was about as wide turning into the stretch, lacked the necessary response. VITESSE three wide onto the turn, was sent into path four exiting it, made
no impact. ORAZIO tracked the leader from along the inside route, tipped out into the two path at the head of the stretch, faltered.
ALONGCAMETHEPRINCE tucked into the three path, sat forwardly placed for nearly three-quarters, slithered its way into path five at the top of the lane
while backing away.

RUNNINGWSCISSORS three then two wide in aim of the front, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command just
outside the eighth pole, dug in under a drive inching away briefly before coming under late threat and held safe to prevail. O'TROUBLE chased just off the
inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and kicked on
belatedly to tepidly threaten late. GOZILLA established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn, came under
coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch under pressure, got collared just outside the eighth pole, kept on to the finish well
clear of the rest for the show honors. ABUELO PAPS got brushed at the start repeatedly by REJECTED AGAIN come in slightly under hustling to the
outside, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened. REJECTED AGAIN hustled from the
gate, came in slightly brushing with ABUELO PAPS three to four times, chased four then three wide coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and weakened. MANOLITO two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, continued two to three wide at the
head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MARACUJA along the outside, scurried into contention with a three wide run beginning from midpoint on the bend, tipped one path farther off the rail in
preparation for the stretch run nearing the quarter pole, settled in upper stretch and got asked for more, gave the desired response, emerging at the eighth
pole as the new leader, steadily kicked clear. MUN LUV was lightly hand urged clearing BECCA'S WISH during the initial stages, went over to the inside
route a panel into the contest, set the pace, feeling pressure on the mild side, felt an uptick in it though just about to enter the stretch, was turned loose, got
lassoed soon afterwards, saw the winner kick further clear, but stayed on well to preserve the place. BECCA'S WISH forwardly placed from the get-go, was
content to concede the advantage to MUN LUV on the backstretch, went on to track that foe from the pocket, was roused going into the two path in the
vicinity of the quarter pole, got outfinished. CAUSE TO DREAM pursued the pace mostly from path two, abandoning it only while riding the rail from the top
of the turn until the three-eighths pole, fanned out into the five path from upper to midstretch, lacked the necessary response. DESPEIGHT ALL ODDS
tucked into the two path prior to leaving the backstretch, sat well reserved within striking distance of the pacesetter for the opening half, was one path farther
the rail for start of the stretch run, gave way. UP SEVENTYFOUR remained forwardly placed after the field had been off and running, kept an eye on the
leader from just off the rail, began to back away as the half was being completed, swung out three wide into the lane and continued to back away.

DOUBLY BLESSED quickly positioned along the inside route, was patiently ridden tracking the pace for the opening half and a little beyond, unleased a
bold rail move coming up to the five-sixteenths pole, seized command, cut the corner under a drive, extended the margin, kept to the task at hand until the
final few jumps. MALIBU STAR off the inside, bumped lightly with an errant DADDY KNOWS prior to arriving at the conclusion of the backstretch, worked
out a tuck into the three path in time for the commencement of the run around the bend, ventured onward prominently placed, was under a ride spinning
three wide into the stretch, proved no match en route for place honors. DADDY KNOWS put to a strong grip on the left, proceeded along the backstretch
getting out, made some contact with the second place finisher nearing the half mile pole, got dragged into the two path at that station, continued as a pace
factor, was put to a drive as the winner was launching what turned out to be a decisive bid in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, failed to keep
pace, salvaged the show. FAMILY BIZ took up the chase three wide, got sent out into path six from upper to midstreth, made no headway in the late stages.
LOST IN ROME well reserved two wide in midpack, went into the lane, had no response. OBSESSED sluggish at the start, made up some ground racing
along the backstretch, remained on the rail after entering the turn, shifted into the two path at the head of the stretch, made no impact. FROSTED ICE
chased the pace three wide on the turn, angled five wide for the drive, gave way. EL HERMANO two wide onto the turn, was spotted into path four exiting it,
had no offering.

Footnotes
GRIT AND GLORY coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside in range of the leader, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the
quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch set down for the drive, rallied up the rail to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command
just inside the sixteenth pole, dug in inching away to prevail in the final jumps. ITS ALL RELEVANT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the
inside, got roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared just inside the sixteenth marker, ran on to the finish
clear of the rest for the place honors. CHIEF KNOW IT ALL just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, advanced to apply pressure midway on the turn,
got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive to procure the show honors. HEAVY ROLLER got bumped between foes at the start
who each broke his way and was squeezed between them, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch
and weakened in the late stages. I LOVE JAXSON four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch offering
up a mild bid, weakened in the final furlong. BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide into
upper stretch and weakened. HAWAIIAN NOISES broke in at the start bumping and squeezing HEAVY ROLLER in tandem with SWIPING DAN, who broke
outwards, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. DYNAMAX PRIME five then
four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide for home and made no impact. REAL DAN got off to an awkward start,
chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. SWIPING DAN broke out at the start bumping and squeezing HEAVY ROLLER in concert with HAWAIIAN NOISES, raced
sluggish early growing detached at the tail of the field three then two wide, tucked inside through the turn, cornered two to three wide for home and trailed.
