Footnotes
TROPHY DADDY closest to the leader just off the inside, continued to stalk that rival in the run up the backstretch, took over far turn, clear into and through
upper stretch, held the runner up at bay late under steady handling. RISKY SITUATION off the early pace, began to move far turn, rallied four wide into the
lane, slowly getting to the winner the final furlong while remaining well out in the strip, well clear of the others. THORNISH settled off the pace and the
inside, raced three wide through the final turn, staged a mild rally in the three path to finished best of the rest, no threat to the top two. CYBER FLAME
lacked early foot while five wide into the first turn, continued back in the run up the backstretch, came five wide once again through the final turn, mild late
interest, too late for the show. ARLINGTON'S SHINE off a step slow, raced back, in some traffic then steadied from between rivals early in the turn,
improved slightly while not a serious threat. TUFFY broke in, lacked speed off the inside, raced back and three wide, failed to respond in the drive. SHINE
JACK'S DREAM settled in mid pack, dropped inside late in the final turn, failed to muster a closing kick. MOONSHINE MOMENT five wide when forwardly
placed into the first turn, chased the winner through the final turn, gave way in the drive. WILL RED fractious while loading, broke a step slow, fell further
behind, never close. LA' HOPPER broke in, was quickly straightened to show the way into the first turn, stopped far turn, distanced after losing contact with
the field, jogged in.

Footnotes
HOME RUN TRICK broke a bit to the inside but on top, set the pace along the inside, shook clear when straightened for home, maintained a daylight
advantage to the wire while being kept to task with a steady right handed stick. DUNPH in the second flight inside and firmly in hand, inched closer in some
traffic late in the final turn, moved out a bit and split foes for the drive, second best. CATDADDY prompted the pace off the inside, tried the winner from the
outside far turn, flattened out in the drive, narrowly held the show while between horses at the wire. COAL TRUTH unhurried early, four wide turning into the
stretch when lodging a mild advance, also failed to sustain that effort through the lane, outkicked for the show while remaining widest of the second flight at
the wire. CASHANOVA last away, trailed most of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals late while never a threat. SHORTLIST allowed to settle off the
pace, bit closer late in the second turn behind traffic, continued mired in traffic upper stretch, finished up evenly when clear in the late going. HARD TO BE
GOOD within striking distance while racing three wide, weakened in the drive.

MACHO ROCCO broke inward but alertly, pressed the leader into the turn, took over in the two path midway on the bend, well clear stretch. IZA DADDY
washy, raced back off the pace and the inside, closer, steadied when between foes into lane, altered 1/16, finished up willingly when clear to be edging
away for the place, no threat to the winner. HERITAGE PARK away in good order, moved up inside to set the pace, offered but brief resistance to the
winner midway on the bend, gradually continued to weaken to lose the place late. AFRICAN WARRIOR broke out, back off the pace and outside, chased
the top two into the lane, lacked a closing punch to lose the show. WEAST HILL void of speed, raced off the inside far turn, three wide into the lane,

Footnotes
NILES CHANNEL unhurried early while off the inside, advanced with a strong move three wide into the stretch, continued to close with good resolve to be
up in the final strides. ENGLANDER dueled up front along the inside, disposed of the other speed to be well clear entering the stretch, proved no match for
the winner half, well clear for the place. MR. PETERKIN allowed to settle off the inside, moved closer three wide and just to the inside of the winner turning
for home, failed to sustain that advance through the stretch to prove no match for the top two. SMACK ATTACK in the second flight toward the inside, two
path in some traffic turning into the stretch, came up empty for the stretch turn. TIZ THE JOURNEY last away, void of speed, bothered by a stricken foe
entering the stretch, remained back. CONFESS dueled up front off the inside, was giving way when forced to take up to avoid a rival who had clipped heels
into the stretch, altered course sharply to the outside, continued far back. POTERYA void of speed, slammed, took up to lose all chance into the stretch.
ROCK RIDGE settled behind the pace while toward the inside, boxed in along the inside through much of the final turn, clipped heels entering the stretch,
fell and was vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE INCIDENT TURNING FOR HOME, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO
STAND.

Footnotes
FRENCH CHARM with the pace from the start, dueled into the turn in the two path, cleared early turn, maintained daylight through the lane while being kept
to task. MOONSHINE DANCING broke out, was straightened to race in mid pack while outside, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, finished with good
late determination to be up late for the place. MY CITY GIRL forwardly placed off the inside, chased the winner while three wide through much of the turn,
continued to pursue that rival into the stretch, caught late for the place. MS FALSETTO in mid pack early, in some traffic early in the turn, dropped inside
late in the bend, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. KALLINIKI in the main group while between horses in the run up the
backstretch, steadied into the turn, four wide through the bend, also went one paced through the lane. UNBURNT in mid pack while racing three wide,
lacked a closing response. COMPETITIVE FIRE back off the pace, raced in some traffic through the turn, improved position a bit when clear for the drive.
IRISH HALO failed to menace while racing well wide. WESTERN ATTIRE raced back, in some tight quarters in traffic into the turn, shuffled back slightly and
failed to menace drive. TAPIT BABY void of speed, remained always back. WHOVILLE in mid pack early inside, had nothing for the drive. HOPPING
JITTERBUG dueled early along the inside, stopped.

Footnotes
JACKMAN away in good order, pressed early off the inside, dueled into the lane, drew out past the furlong marker under a right handed stick. QUALITY
RUN lacked speed for a half, two path through the turn while remaining back, rallied through the stretch to up in time for the place. KICKIN' KIRBY broke on
top, alternated up front while closest to the inside, continued on equal terms with the winner through the bend, could not match strides with that one through
the stretch, caught late for the place. COACH DAN in the second flight while racing in the two path, went evenly through the stretch to miss the show. THAT
DUDE forwardly placed and three wide for a half, had little for the drive. AXIS back off the pace and the inside, angled four wide into the lane, improved
position slightly while never dangerous. TRAIL DRIVER in the main body along the inside, moved slightly closer while continuing to save ground late in the
turn, no menace. HARRY behind the leaders three wide, made little impact in the drive. MY LITTLE TIP off a step slow, remained back in lacking a rally. GO
GO GIROLAMO broke to the outside, was straightened to race within striking distance while four wide into the turn, five wide exiting the bend, faded through
the stretch. GOT IT ALL fell well back, was never a factor. DRYSPELL off a step slow, was never involved while trailing throughout.

Footnotes
SNAPPER SINCLAIR broke out, allowed the pace to go before a quarter in the two path, advanced, steered out a bit to engage the leaders three wide
turning for home, long drive, fully extended. PLAINSMAN dueled up front while closest to the inside, continued to vie through the final turn, held a narrow
advantage past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner while hold sway for the place. THIRSTFORLIFE unhurried early, moved closer
turning for home, waited behind the runner up then altered course to the rail just inside the furlong grounds, finished up willingly. AMERICAN DUBAI dueled
up front off the inside, continued to vie while between the top two past the furlong marker, weakened late. LORD DRAGON prompted the pace while off the
inside, came up empty for the drive. YOU'RE TO BLAME void of speed, failed to muster a rally. CARLOS L. squeezed at the start, was a bit rank early while
in the two path, stout restraint onto the backstretch, moved out to be four wide for the second turn, steady retreat.

FRENCH EMPIRE broke with the leaders, took back off the issue early, moved out for room from behind the first flight turning into the stretch, challenged
nearing the furlong marker and kicked clear with authority. HEADLAND forwardly placed off the inside, challenged between foes turning for home, vied past
the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner, proved determined for the place. AIN'T NO ELMERS just off the pace and the inside, moved closer
three wide and inside the winner exiting the turn, hung late to be outkicked for the place. SUNNY DALE behind the pace while toward the inside, waited
behind horses late in the bend, clear for the drive, went evenly to the wire. BYE BYE J last to leave, back off the pace and the inside, came four out to five
wide for the drive, lacked a closing response to finish up evenly. SHE'S ALL WOLFE broke out, raced back and outside, four wide through the turn, picked
off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. RING LEADER narrowly set the pace for a half along the inside through a quick opening
quarter, faltered in the drive. PERUVIAN APPEAL lacked early spe3ed, three wide into the lane, failed to fire. A THOUSAND REASONS vied up front for
four furlongs just off the inside, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
WICKED FLASHBACK forwardly placed along the inside, showed the way through the turn while continuing to save ground, asked along late in the bend,
protracted drive, showed good determination to prove best. AWESOME INDRA with the pace while between foes into the turn three wide, vied into the lane
outside the winner, could not get by that one through the length of the stretch to be outfinished, prevailed for the place. MS. MALEVOLENCE in mid pack
early while racing outside, four wide through the turn when moving closer, tepid late bid, outkicked. BEAUTY DAY with the pace outside, vied four wide into
the turn, gradually weakened through the lane. TIGER BAIT in the main pack early along the inside, in some traffic, then worked way out to be four wide for
the drive, displayed some modest late interest to improve position. LADY GUSTO lacked early foot while outside, improved position slightly while remaining
out in the strip. FRENCH ROSE settled in mid pack early, went one paced throughout. MIDNIGHT KARMA within striking distance in the early going toward
the inside, steadied in tight quarters midway on the turn, weakened in the drive. ALL IN BRONSON steadied to be off slowly, raced well back, passed a few
tiring rivals while never a serious threat. VISUAL MAGIC made little impact while racing off the inside. MINJI remained always back to be outrun. BOBBIE
TOO TOO flashed brief speed between foes, stopped in the drive.
