Footnotes
SAN ANTONE , lightly bumped by COUNT THE SHELLS leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three wide, was under brisk urging in upper stretch,
swept to command approaching the eighth pole then drew off. PASSAGE OF LINES lacked speed, swung three wide leaving the turn, was taken to the
inner rail near the eighth pole and passed a tired foe late. STRETCH THE TRUTH , three deep leaving the backstretch, opened up on the turn, remained
well off the rail and gave way late. COUNT THE SHELLS came out at the break, chased the pace, angled to the three path in upper stretch and weakened.
COHODES hugged the inner rail chasing the early pace and gave way leaving the turn.

Footnotes
MOONLIGHT MISS came out at the break and bumped with GRAND ENTRADA, steadied when correcting soon after, regrouped and settled in the clear,
advanced four wide in hand past the three eighths, went on the attack past the five sixteenths, secured command into the lane then widened under a drive.
CHELICHNA broke a step slow, raced three wide early, dropped in and settled, saved ground from the three eighths, worked through a narrow opening
along the rail past the eighth pole and churned on willingly to earn the place in the final yards. ENGLISH CHARMER tracked four wide early, bid three wide
under a ride past the three eighths, moved clear after six furlongs, was taken on by the winner soon after, chased from upper stretch and gave way
grudgingly. GRAND ENTRADA , bumped and pinched back at the break, lagged off the pace, saved ground past the five sixteenths and was outrun.
SCARLET'S SONG came in at the break and bumped with a foe, straightened and pulled her way clear, set the early pace well off the inside, dropped in to
about the two path into the far turn, failed to resist a challenge past the three eighths and faltered. LA SMARTY , fractious pre race, was taken to rate early,
advanced inside past the five eighths marker to take aim, was under pressure pursuing past the three furlong pole, failed to kick on, shifted out and gave
way.

Footnotes
LUCIAN settled outside a rival early on, commenced his run when given his cue leaving the far turn, advanced four wide under a solid ride and engaged the
leader into the lane, took over inside the three sixteenths, spurted clear soon after, drifted in then held sway while kept alert. GOSH settled off the pace, got
through along the inside when advancing into the mid stretch, shifted out some and continued with interest while second best. UNBRIDLED PARROTT ,
wide while off the early pace, raced two wide into the stretch, dropped in for the final furlong and churned on to pass a tired rival. GRAYWING , a bit
fractious in the gate, broke outward, was corrected and went well clear in the opening quarter mile, set the pace under a light hold past the three eighths
marker, saw his lead diminish while three wide into the lane, ceded command past three sixteenths and faltered through the final seventy yards.
ARTILLERY lagged off the pace, raced four to five wide into the lane but failed to menace. MAGIC OF LOVE stalked off the rail, was under pressure past
the three eighths, had nothing to give entering the lane and dropped back. ZAGA , five wide nearing the lane, was outrun.

Footnotes
JOYFUL NOISE stalked the early pace, advanced four deep on the turn, challenged for the lead outside DAT DARES GOLD leaving the turn, dueled
through the stretch and determinedly prevailed. DAT DARES GOLD moved up in the three path on the turn, challenged for the lead midway on the bend,
dueled inside the winner through the stretch and just missed in a game performance. HETTY G. lacked speed, was five deep on the turn, floated wider in
upper stretch, raced outside foes and passed tired ones. NIGHTMARE speed two wide leaving the backstretch, raced inside horses on the turn and
weakened. R TRUE SENSATION , checked in traffic leaving the backstretch, was steadied lacking room around the turn, remained in hand in upper stretch,
swung outside in mid stretch and finished willingly. THE CIRCLE GAME , five wide on the turn, gave way in the drive and returned bleeding. I'M SO MUNNY
showed speed along the rail down the backstretch and gave way on the turn. BALLERINA KITTEN raced along the inner rail on the turn while outrun.

SONG OF HONOR relaxed three wide stalking the leader, moved to engage mid turn, secured command under some asking entering the lane, turned away
an outside challenge past the three sixteenths then pulled away under a drive. ROCKINHIPPIECHICK rated close up while off the inside, ranged up four
wide to loom a solid presence past the quarter pole, could not kick on with the winner heading towards mid stretch but kept on with effort to the line. SHE'S
ALL COURAGE settled off the pace, dropped in to save ground heading to the half mile marker, came back out near mid stretch and offered a mild
response. FEARLESS LASSIE pulled herself to command outside a rival leaving the chute, dropped in when clearing past the three quarter pole, set a rated
pace two wide, took pressure from the winner heading towards the three eighths, was under coaxing to try and keep pace into the lane, failed to kick on past
the three sixteenths and gave way. SHERIFF'S KID , sent from the gate, saved ground chasing the pace, was under asking heading to the lane and faded.
LONG DISTANCE LOVE drifted in at the break, steadied soon after, was taken back off the pace and off the inside, shifted five wide for the drive but came
up empty.

FRIEND ME CHARLIE hugged the inner rail chasing the pace, closed determinedly late and was up approaching the wire. ALWAYS TALKING broke alertly,
set the pace in the three path around the turn, held the advantage in mid stretch then was out finished. COMBAT QUEEN saved ground around the turn,
angled out a bit near the sixteenth pole and rallied mildly. JUDI BLUE EYES , four wide on the turn, was well positioned in upper stretch but failed to rally.
NINE MARTINIS , four wide chasing the pace on the turn, weakened. NAUGHTY THOUGHTS , six deep leaving the backstretch, was not a factor.

Footnotes
NOMO RON , with the pace three deep and under rating, moved to a short lead without much asking mid turn, shook clear of STROLL SMOKIN after being
set down in upper stretch then edged away some late while kept to task. STROLL SMOKIN broke sharply and established the early lead inside a pair of
rivals, emerged in a battle with STROLL SMOKIN leaving the three eighths marker, fought on under pressure into the lane, could not quite match strides
past the three sixteenths but continued with good energy despite drifting out late. ALWAYS SUNSHINE had speed between foes, eased back off the leaders
leaving the far turn, shifted out a bit, pursued into the lane but came up empty in the final furlong. FORTUNATE FRIENDS , four to five wide pursuing the
leaders, lacked a stretch response. TYBALT , acting up a bit as the gates sprung, broke awkwardly, dropped in early, edged up a bit nearing the half, swung
wide for the drive but failed to generate a rally.

Footnotes
GARRISON'S CHARGE worked between horses around the turn, was three wide approaching the stretch, closed outside TOMMY THE TORCH and gained
the lead inside the sixteenth pole. TOMMY THE TORCH showed speed in the two path, raced inside the winner through the stretch, dug in but faded late.
MORE TWIRL , four wide on the turn, lugged in near the sixteenth pole and failed to sustain his move. COMMANDING GENERAL , four wide on the turn,
floated to the six path in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. TYREEK , along the inner rail entering the turn, was in the two path leaving the turn and
lacked a rally. SMITE showed speed along the inner rail, was done in upper stretch then steadily retreated.
