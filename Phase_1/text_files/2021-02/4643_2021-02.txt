Footnotes
WATCH YOUR STEP broke in front, set all the pace, drifted out the length of the stretch despite right handed urging and urging and prevailed under strong
handling. WEBER close up along the rail, shifted outside the winner at the top of the stretch, was forced out causing his rider to check repeatedly through
the drive and finished well clear for second. TRUENO unhurried early, had a mild late rally out past the middle of the racetrack. PIRATE'S TREASURE
stalked the pace and went evenly in the three path. TROOPER THORN was no factor. GIO SAMMY stumbled at the start, chased the winner from the four
path into the stretch then weakened. J J JUNIOR well placed, failed to respond. PRE FLIGHT was never close. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY
SIGN AND THE RIDER OF WEBER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE
STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED WATCH YOUR STEP AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

CAUSE OF LOVE allowed to settle, closed fast four wide through the final furlong and was along in time. DEB'S ALL OUT unhurried, drifted in a bit in upper
stretch, closed with a rush five wide and got up for second. SHEZ SHACKED UP pressed the pace two then three wide and was outfinished despite a game
effort. A SMILE A DAY sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. WINE ME UP BABY stalked
the pace into the stretch, loomed boldly along the inside then failed to sustain that bid. DANCING GRACE trailed, was squeezed between rivals at the top of
the stretch then passed tiring rivals. HELLS BELLS HELEN was no threat. CEE CEE'S GOT THIS had brief speed. BEEBLEGEE was no factor.

CLOSE THE CASE stalked the pace along the rail, slipped through to make the lead on the turn, set the balance of the pace and finished full of run to win
going away. SIR SWAYSALOT pressed the pace two wide and finished second best. GOOD LUCK JUSTICE never far back, offered a mild bid four wide
through the turn and finished with good courage in the six path. STORM PEAK dueled for the lead three wide into the stretch then faded. LABYRINTH failed
to menace. DANZO stalked the pace from between horses and weakened in the stretch. BUCKEYE RUCKUS with the second flight near the inside, failed to
respond. HAUNTED MESA had brief speed, stopped on the turn was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
INSPIRING LILY dueled for the lead along the inside into the turn, shook clear and widened into the stretch then maintained her advantage under strong
handling. DENIRO'SRUNFORFUN stalked the pace into the stretch, rallied determinedly in the five path and finished well clear for second.
NICEASAKITTENSEYES broke slowly and bore in, checked along the rail nearing the half mile marker, shifted out to the six path entering the stretch and
closed a gap late. I'M JAC'D well placed, failed to respond. HAUGHTY PRAISE settled mid pack and went evenly. LARSA battled with the winner two wide
into the stretch then weakened. DE BOLT LIGHT passed tiring rivals. ZVOLUME was no factor. GLORIOUS GLITTER was outrun. CRYPTO'S IMAGE was
through early.
