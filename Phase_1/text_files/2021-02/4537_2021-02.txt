Footnotes
GLORY ROLL was prompted to gain terms with the leaders nearest the rail in the opening furlong, was eased back nearing the seven sixteenths marker,
then steadied out of close quarters racing into the turn, responded when prompted to advance inside foes along the rail racing into upper stretch, wrested
the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm encouragement. RATTLESNAKEROSE broke readily, forced the pace four wide in the
opening quarter, went clear entering the turn, shifted inwards nearing upper stretch but proved no match for the winner in the last furlong. SAY ADIOS, in
touch with the first flight between foes in the opening stages, was eased off the pace racing into the turn, shifted to the four path nearing upper stretch
steadily regaining striking distance but lacked the needed final bid. APRIL FOG, urged three wide between foes disputing the pace, gave way into upper
stretch. FOXY LADY was settled off the first flight racking those rivals off the inside racing to the turn but offered no rally. MOON OVER VICTORIA was
settled outside a rival tracking off the first flight but faded early.

Footnotes
BOOTLEGGER (FR) was rated tracking just off the first flight racing to the turn, commenced a steady advance three deep racing into upper stretch and
wrested the advantage in late stages under firm handling to prevail. FEDERAL CASE shifted a bit off the inside in the opening stages while being uged to
dictate the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening quarter, dueled for command inside a rival entering the turn, turned back that foe to go clear in upper
stretch but was collared late. D'URBAN PARK settled last racing to the turn, then steadily gained position four wide between foes racing into upper stretch to
close the gap on the top pair late. PURIMETER tracked off the second flight between foes into the turn and continued evenly three deep to late stages.
DOUBLE DEEP tracked off the second flight racing four wide into the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. STONE HANDS tracked just off the
pacesetter between foes early, was prompted to press the leader racing through the turn and emptied out in upper stretch. MY DISCRETION, off awkwardly,
was prompted to be a brief factor inside foes in second flight but faded entering the bend.

Footnotes
PHILO was rated tracking the leaders from out of striking distance racing outside a rival to the backstretch, commenced a steady, three wide advance on the
far turn to challenge for command in upper stretch, wrested a narrow advantage leaving the furlong marker and just prevailed under firm right handed
encouragement. DISCREET HEAT broke readily to gain a narrow advantage racing to the first turn, dictated the pace a bit off the rail through the
backstretch into the far turn, dueled for command racing past the furlong marker and grudgingly resisted the winner to the end despite the loss of his rider's
whip in the final sixteenth. NICOLE MUNNINGS, urged to terms prompting the pacesetter racing into the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn and
weakened between foes nearing midstretch. PURCHASING POWER tracked off the first flight racing just inside the eventual winner in the opening half,
switched out racing through the far turn but steadily faded into the lane. ONE STOP SHOP broke slowly losing position to the field, angled to the inside
early, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. WILD ABOUT YOU settled into stride racing a bit off the rail dropping off the second
flight racing to the backstretch and never menaced thereafter.

DO WHAT IT TAKES was rated off the first flight in the opening stages, then was prompted to advance three wide into the turn gaining a position just off the
pacesetter, was fanned four wide into upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage between calls leaving the furlong marker, lost the advantage inside the
sixteenth marker but responded to right handed pressure and firm hand urging to just edge EXCEED THE GOAL on the wire. The latter was reserved last
outside foes in the opening quarter, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the turn, shifted out five wide in upper stretch while advancing to
challenge, gained the advantage leaving the sixteenth marker but just failed to contain the winner's late surge. NOTHINS FREE, prominent outside foes in
the opening stages, shifted inwards racing into the turn dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, held sway into upper stretch while shifting to the three
path but gave out leaving the furlong marker once headed by the eventual winner. TURING MACHINE tracked just off the pacesetter between foes in early
stages, dropped off those foes while angling inside on the turn but had no closing bid. PATIENT DIGNA, urged inside rivals prompting the pace in the
opening stages, shifted off the rail racing into the turn while continuing in pursuit of the leader but gave way entering the lane. SIDEPOCKET BET dropped
out early. JANET B DOESIT ALL WAS SCRATCHED AFTER THE POST PARADE ON THE ADVICE OF THE VETERINARIAN.

Footnotes
CHICK'S SHADOW was rated along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, tipped out racing into upper stretch to split foes just off the
inside, gained a narrow advantage leaving the sixteenth marker and maintained that margin to the end under firm handling. FALL MOON settled between
foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail on the far turn and continued to make steady progress inside foes to gain terms with the
winner late while just failing to edge that rival. PRINCESS CORA tracked the leaders outside the eventual winner as part of the second flight racing to the
backstretch, advanced three deep to challenge nearing upper stretch, was fanned four wide contesting the issue past midstretch but was outkicked by the
top pair. LAKE PARIMA settled outside foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch, was fanned five
wide in the last furlong but continued willingly to close the gap. BACI, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, pressed the issue
on the far turn into upper stretch, shifted out three wide while gaining a narrow advantage midstretch and faded in late stages. BETTERTHENYOURX sped
to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on narrow margin to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. MELISSANI settled off the second flight
along the inside in the opening stages, was steadied avoiding tight quarters midway through the first turn and offered no rally thereafter.

Footnotes
SOUR KICKS, bumped by CURTIN'S UP, then squeezed between foes at the start, dropped out last after the break, was prompted to regain position while
switching outside foes racing into the turn, angled six wide in upper stretch advancing to challenge, lugged inwards under pressure leaving midstretch but
continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time. IMPERIAL IVOR angled inwards tracking off the second flight racing into the turn, split
foes three wide when presented an opening in upper stretch, struck the front midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner's final bid. VALLEY WILDCAT
exchanged bumps with SOUR KICKS at the start, settled collecting his stride racing to the turn, swung out seven wide in upper stretch and continued with a
steady effort to improve position to the end while prevailing for a share. SLICK STAR, in touch with a rival prompting the pace racing through the
backstretch, pressed the issue on the turn to gain a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, continued to dispute the issue in close quarters four deep
between foes leaving the furlong marker but weakened late while losing his path to the eventual winner. CURTIN'S UP, broke outwards bumping SOUR
KICKS and forcing that rival into the path of VALLEY WILDCAT, was righted, then urged inside foes in pursuit of the leaders along the rail racing into the
turn, came through inside foes to challenge for command in upper stretch but flattened out late. PRETTY CHITU tracked off the first flight three wide
between foes, shifted out five wide while being urged to challenge racing into upper stretch but soon emptied out. CONGRATS THAT, urged along the
inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the turn, gave way between foes nearing upper stretch. TRULY STELLAR tracked off the first
flight between foes racing to the turn, was urged to make a brief bid after a half but soon emptied out. SPINNING JOEY settled well off the leaders while
angling inwards early and failed to menace. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF SLICK STAR LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

shifted out five wide in upper stretch and rallied to the lead in time under firm left handed pressure. TANAGER tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of
the second flight, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch steadily gaining on the leaders, struck the front midstretch but couldn't contain the winner while
resisting that rival to the end. MORGAN'S Z VA tracked off the first flight a bit off the inside to the backstretch, advanced three deep between foes entering
the far turn to bid for command between foes nearing upper stretch, contested the issue inside the top pair to midstretch but weakened in late stages while
prevailing for a share. ANIMAUXSELLE, reserved last while angling inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out to split foes three deep leaving the far turn,
then angled six wide leaving midstretch while finishing with interest. SHES DYNOMITE, forwardly placed along the rail prompting the pace, conceded the
lead on the backstretch while switching outside the pacesetter, was urged along the inside in pursuit of the leaders into upper stretch but faded in late
stages. UNABRIDGED (IRE) tracked off the second flight in the opening half, was prompted with an early move to advance on the leaders four wide racing
into the far turn, shifted inwards under pressure into the path of the leaders nearing upper stretch and flattened out entering the lane. ANNIE UP BUCK
tracked off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, then faded between foes nearing the lane while being held up momentarily in close quarters.
ELUSIVE RYDER was rated off the second flight along the inside, made brief progress along the rail midway through the backstretch to gain a position just
inside the leaders entering the far turn, was checked out of tight quarters midway through that bend and had no further response. HOLLYWOOD TOMCAT
settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. MARIES MELODY angled inwards racing through the chute to

bend, dueled inside foes into upper stretch and gave way abruptly leaving midstretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
