Footnotes
TRACI'S GIRL took the lead approaching the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the advantage near the rail on the turn, drifted into the
stretch but dug in under steady handling to hold on. FRIENDLY FAIRBANKS had the lead most of the opening three sixteenths of a mile then gave chase
from the three eighths pole, raced at a close disadvantage off the rail on the turn, was carried out into the lane and just lasted in second while flattening
stride late. PAINT ME PRETTY broke a bit awkwardly and raced well off the early pace, bid nearing the quarter pole, rounded the turn about the five path,
dug in from the top of the lane to finish well and just missed second. TAR HEEL PALACE engaged in close early chase, raced in the five path of the turn
then flattened stride the final sixteenth. SWEET PIPER dropped well back from early contention and gave chase outside, raced off the rail on the turn and
finished well. GYPSY SOUL chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened stride. Racing without shoes, BELL THE CAT gave chase and raced
in the five path of the turn but showed little more. TRINNI LOVE gave chase, raced in the three path of the turn then weakened.

Footnotes
HOT N SPICY LOVE rated a slim lead inside, was met by The Predictor into the second turn and dueled clear of that one approaching the quarter pole, dug
in to the threat of Wall at the same time, drifted leaving the far turn, raced clear into the stretch and drew off the final sixteenth. CRAZY IDEA raced in the
five path the first two turns and entered the backstretch outside, bid from the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and dug in to
take second the final yards. WALL rounded the first turn about the three path and settled off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, threatened at the
quarter and came through the far turn still in the three path, was carried out into the lane, angled inside Hot N Spicy Love at the eighth pole but flattened
stride the final sixteenth. NEW AFLEET saved ground off the early pace, bid past the five sixteenths pole and raced two deep on the far turn, angled to the
rail into the lane but flattened stride. MY EMINENCE dropped back from early contention while saving ground, eased out into the backstretch and bid from
the three eighths pole, had range on the lead in the five path of the far turn, but weakened into the lane. DYNAFORM rounded the first turn about the four
path, raced well off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch. BANISHMENT was not a factor. THE PREDICTOR stalked the early pace
two deep and took a slim lead on the second turn, dueled through the backstretch but dropped back approaching the quarter pole and faded at the rail on
the far turn.

IMPETUOUS rated the pace off the rail, came under pressure into the stretch and held on well under steady urging. GRAND FIBER gave chase and raced
near the rail on the turn, but couldn't gain on the winner. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND chased the leaders, raced near the rail on the turn and finished evenly. MY
TIME IN COURT settled off the pace, ran through the turn about the three path then flattened stride the final sixteenth. BARNSTORM was steadily driven on
the outside, raced in the seven path of the turn and could only improve his position. TAKE IT TO SCALE gave chase, raced in the six path of the turn and
showed little more in the lane. SCYTHE chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the six path and showed little further. GRANDPA
MUNSTER stalked through the backstretch, took aim approaching the quarter pole, then drifted toward the head of the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
C V'S POWERPAK raced in the four path the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn five wide, was carried further outward
toward the head of the lane, but dug in under steady encouragement to get up the final jump. KATALIMA settled close then picked up the chase toward the
seven sixteenths pole, dueled to a slim lead nearing the five sixteenths, raced clear inside the eighth pole, dug in to steady encouragement but was caught
the final jump. MISS GRANDSTANDER raced two deep the first turn then settled close four wide into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths
pole, stayed in range three wide on the far turn but flattened stride leaving the turn. DIAMOND TRAIN saved ground off the pace the first turn, bid toward the
three eighths pole and angled to the six path from the mid point of the far turn, then passed rivals outside. ADDY'S LOVE stalked two deep then gave chase
from the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn, angled out nearing the head of the lane but showed little more. CHEESE LOUISE took the
early lead and angled to the inside to set the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught approaching the five sixteenths,
dropped back into the lane and weakened. QUINCYS WAY was not a factor.

Footnotes
BELLA BASORA rushed up for the lead past the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the turn and was steadily encouraged to hold
on well. HURRICANE DIRECTOR gave chase and raced in the three path of the turn, then settled for second best. DOMS LADY chased toward the inside
then checked off the inside flank of J C The Destroyer past the five sixteenths pole, raced off the rail most of the turn then drifted out in the upper stretch and
dueled HIDE for third, while the latter of whom gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the six path and was outfinished in the stretch duel for
third. J C THE DESTROYER chased through the backstretch then angled in nearing the quarter pole, raced in the two and three paths of the turn, drifted
outward approaching the top of the lane and showed little more. FULLMOON BAY gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn then weakened. CARROT
CAKE raced mostly outside and was not a factor. SMOOKIE gave chase and rounded the turn near the rail. TRINNI SOPHIA raced outside and was not a
factor.

Footnotes
SECRET CASTLE settled close inside the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and closed
to contention in the five path of the far turn, dueled to the lead mid-stretch and edged clear later yards. MABEL angled in to stalk the early pace two deep,
challenged toward the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms from the five sixteenths, took the nod midway on the far turn but was caught mid-stretch
and relented later yards. YOU CANT CATCH HER was bumped at the break and settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. DUDES PICK raced well off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn, eased
out into the backstretch and bid toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the five path and raced evenly outside down the lane.
TECHNIQUE ONLY took over and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole and was met at even terms at
the five sixteenths, gave up the nod midway on the far turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. PERSONAL SERVER showed little response through the
backstretch. SINGLE MOM bobbled outward and made contact with You Cant Catch her, raced in the four path the opening turn and picked up the chase
toward the seven sixteenths pole, then weakened on the far turn. DIAL EMMA REILLY was never a factor.
