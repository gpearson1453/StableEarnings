sway under steady handling. DEMO DOCTOR stalked the early pace, raced three wide on the turn and rallied mildly. PALATIAL TIMES lacked speed, raced
four deep turning for home and failed to rally. SO DIALED IN , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, advanced along the inner rail to gain the
lead near the half mile, remained along the rail and weakened through the stretch. WICKED PRANKSTER , outrun, swung wide in upper stretch. SWING

BRING ME ANSWERS broke sharply and disputed the pace inside rivals around the first turn, edged away a bit entering the backstretch and set a rated
pace towards the inside, was guided out to about the three path while being set down soon into the lane, opened up under a solid drive in mid stretch then
was only under steady hand asking the final seventy yards. SIMMARD SHENANIGAN broke a beat slow, was sent up four wide between rivals early,
dropped in heading towards the backstretch and took to rating, moved up inside rivals nearing the lane and gave hard chase as the closest pursuer in mid
stretch, stayed willingly and saved the place. POSTINO'S SECRET , unhurried early while saving ground, continued inside into and through the lane, moved
up past the furlong grounds but was out finished for second. TUXEDO LEMON prompted the pace outside the winner, was under a solid ride three wide
between runners into the stretch but failed to find the needed response. TWO CARAT lost ground five wide outside rivals from the start, took closer order
under asking past the three eighths, gave willing pursuit to deep stretch then faded. THERE GOES MY GIRL was squeezed back soon after the break,
settled off the inside, made a mild run past the five sixteenths, angled five wide into the lane but lacked any further response. SHECOR , three to four wide
between rivals while tracking the winner, was under heavy pressure into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
KINGSTON PIKE , away in good order and flashing some speed, was rated back from between rivals heading towards the five eighths marker, stalked
outside a rival into the turn, edged up between foes while coaxed along past the five sixteenths, shifted out four wide into the lane, closed under steady left
handed asking, took over with a furlong remaining and drew clear under steady handling. DIVINE INTERVENTIO was sent up between foes early to contest
the pace, battled two to three wide outside TRUE BOLDNESS from the five eighths to the three sixteenths, gained a slim soon after, failed to fend off the
winner from his outside but kept on gamely to the wire. JUST KIDDING , with the pace three to four wide outside rivals, was under pressure trying to keep
up with the embattled leaders mid turn, circled into the lane but lacked a solid finish and faded. TRUE BOLDNESS advanced inside rivals soon after the
break and poked a head in front, sparred on a short lead from the five eighths to the three sixteenths, hung in gamely to mid stretch then surrendered. AULD
LANGE SYNE , sluggish from the gate, lagged well back, was under a ride three wide into the stretch, shifted out and had belated interest. DON'T POKE
THE CAT dropped in early and moved up heading towards the half mile marker, was under asking trying to remain in range past the five sixteenths, failed to
kick on entering the lane and gave way.

IN CLASS bumped LAST GREAT when bearing out at the break, steadied in traffic near the five eighths pole, swung five deep leaving the turn, advanced
outside horses, gained the lead near the sixteenth pole and was kept under urging. PETES PRIDE saved ground around the turn, setting a pressured pace,
was still in front near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. EMBRACE A NEW DAY bumped with LAST GREAT leaving the starting gate, was well
positioned four deep leaving the turn and flattened out. ARBUTUS raced along the inner rail most of the trip and finished evenly. WIN THEN GRIN , three
wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive. OLIVE'S BUMPA lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn, swung to the six path in
mid stretch and was never a factor. SILVER SIDES prompted the pace two wide around the turn and weakened. LAST GREAT , jostled leaving the starting
gate, was outrun. CONGRESS HALL unseated her rider when she reared at the break, then was caught by the starter soon after. There was a stewards'
inquiry concerning the break but no action was taken.

Footnotes
KEEPYOURSKATESON rated five wide outside rivals and off of a contested pace, ranged up and bid four deep entering the lane, secured command inside
the three sixteenths and steadily pulled away under a drive. GALOFMYDREAMS saved ground in range of the embattled leaders, got through along the rail
to challenge mid turn, dueled on near even terms into the lane, kept on gamely and narrowly held the place. HELEN GIBSON was caught four wide between
rivals stalking the pace, awaited some room behind a quartet of runners into the stretch, shifted out for the final furlong and finished with good energy. NINE
MAST vied four wide outside of COOKIES AND CREAM heading into the turn, fought on three wide between foes into the stretch, stayed willingly past the
furlong grounds then faded late. LA CASTIGLIONE , between runners early, chased in the clear past the three eighths, came three wide into the stretch but
failed to rally. REINE SECRET broke slowly, raced well back into the turn, circled five wide and made a bit of headway past the three sixteenths then failed
to seriously sustain. COOKIES AND CREAM had speed well off the rail early on, dropped in some to contest the pace around the turn, fought on between
runners into the stretch then weakened past the furlong grounds. GYPSY'S IMAGE stalked the early pace between horses then weakened past the five
sixteenths. CHARLIV was outrun.

Footnotes
WORKIN ON A DREAM , four deep prompting the pace, moved to command under left handed rousing near mid stretch, came in under right handed
rousing near the sixteenth pole, straightened then drew clear. SEANY P chased the quartet of duelers past the five sixteenths, angled six wide for the drive
and churned on to be along for the place. JOVIS speed to a short early lead, dueled between rivals from the three eighths past mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly. INSIDE RISK , with the pace three wide and between foes, battled between runners into the lane, steadied when put in close by the winner near
the sixteenth marker, regrouped and kept on with effort. REFORM SCHOOL edged up inside runners early on and prompted the pace, bid along the rail to
join the leader leaving the far turn, dueled and gained a slim advantage near the quarter pole, kept up the fight past the furlong pole then gave way
stubbornly. MARCO ISLAND , fractious pre race, was outrun. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the rider of INSIDE RISK, WORKIN ON A
DREAM was disqualified from first and placed fourth for causing interference in the stretch.
