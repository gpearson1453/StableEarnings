Footnotes
DEVIL'S CODE broke in at the start bumping SHINJUKU in tandem with NEURO and pinching that rival back between foes, chased just off the inside
coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled out six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, edged clear
under a drive to prevail. CLEVER FELLOW chased three wide in aim of the front until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on the leader to the eighth pole when overhauled in tandem by the top one,
then kept on to secure the place honors. SHINJUKU got bumped between foes and pinched back at the start conceding three lengths to the front, tipped out
to chase five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing just past the three-eighths, swung five
wide for home, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, flattened out in the late stages while along for the show honors. ME 'N SAP established the front and
showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, remained patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, then weakened through to the finish. JADE'S DREAM bobbled
at the break, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, swung
four wide for home and weakened in the stretch. NEURO broke out a step at the start bumping SHINJUKU in tandem with DEVIL'S CODE who broke
inwards and pinched that middle rival back, chased along the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DAVID'S GEM broke in line with BLUES CITY, shook free of that opponent after a few jumps to establish control, led the way towards the two path on the
backstretch, dove over closer to the rail in time for the beginning of the run around the bend, carved out the pace rated along on a loosely-contested
advantage, was finishing off the run leading up to and then through the furlong grounds when called upon for more, offered up the desired to stay sufficiently
in the clear. VICTORY BUILT settled into the three path before leaving the backstretch, patiently kept an eye on the winner, went into the stretch, was in the
general area of the three-sixteenths pole when turned loose, got staved off. BLUES CITY assumed a prominent position, took up the role of primary pursuer,
going about the task two wide, was put to a drive a short distance beyond the quarter pole, got outfinished. NUMBER ONE DILLON loosely pocketed,
weakened down the stretch. HAVE A HEART off last after lunging at the break, travelled three to four wide on the turn, was about as wide during the stretch
drive making no headway. BRONXVILLE took up position in midpack, chose path two as the one to take in pursuit of the top one on the turn, got driven to
the outside stepping onto the head of the stretch, wound up four to five wide, lacked the necessary response. IMPLIED VOLATILITY off the inside, raced
three wide on the turn, was steadily maneuvered to the outside after entering the stretch until five to six wide, failed to gain. COHIBA GHOST quickly
spotted along the rail, faltered off the ground-saving journey that followed.

Footnotes
HAPPY FARM away without apparent mishap, went at it on even terms with REED KAM for nearly the opening two panels, cleared that foe with a sudden
turn of foot entering the turn, led the way on an ever-expanding advantage, towards path two, settled in upper stretch and was switched over to stronger
handling, held on with willingness as the late-closer POPIZAR was rallying for the place. POPIZAR settled towards the back of the pack, was strung out
approximately five wide on the turn, came into the stretch, finished with belated energy down the center of the strip to be along for second. BODEFLEX
reluctant to load, proceeded to break without incident, took up the chase in the neighborhood of path four on the turn, was placed one nearer the rail for the
stretch run, failed to reel in the winner, then lost out on the place slot too. SNEAKINESS along the outside, was in midpack pursuing the pace three to four
wide, was more the latter after spinning into the lane, mustered up a mild response sufficient enough to earn the last major check. REED KAN sent over to
the inside, argued to the left of the winner for a good portion of the trip leading up to the half mile pole, tipped out to be two to three wide at that station after
getting flicked off, was more in the two path getting ridden into the lane, had no rally. VICI saved ground and faltered. PROMO CODE two wide at the top of
the turn, got spotted in path three at the top of the lane, never made his presence felt.

bobbled at the break, established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, got set down spinning just
off the inside for home, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was collared seventy yards from home. TRAPPEZE ARTIST

Footnotes
ECHOES OF DESTINY two to three wide, stalked a hotly-contested pace, was more the former coming into the stretch under a drive, whittled away at the
deficit, altered course towards path four to be outside the ones to catch in midstretch, maintained its run and continued to make good progress on the front
runners, overhauled the last of three weary warriors, that being WHAT'S MY CATEGORY, in the last seventy yards and edged clear. WHAT'S MY
CATEGORY guided into the three path, disputed the pace as the widest of three until the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, proved powerless to stall the top one
once that rival arrived on the scene in deep stretch, managed to save second. KIKKERLAND left the post parade and his pony for a long strong warmup,
proceeded to break from the gate in good order, shifted into the two path, kept watch on the three-way tussle up ahead, got cued up for the drive, angled
four turning into the lane, mustered up a mild response sufficient enough to claim the show award. DEVIOUS MO placed in path two, argued for command
from between rivals until approximately a sixteenth to go, weakened late. MR FANTASY cut over to the rail, vied as the innermost of a trio until around the
sixteenth pole, before giving way. PRODUCTION CREDIT two wide onto the turn, got sent out into path three exiting it, made no headway. SOLAR ZEN
taken hold after coming in with his initial step, was maneuvered over to the rail approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, went on to save ground to no
avail. SON OF AN EX departed the backstretch from path two, strolled into path five entering the stretch, improved while proceeding to the wire under a
protective hold.

Footnotes
DUBLINORNOTHIN broke out a step at the start bumping CHEATHAM HILL, chased five then four wide patiently handled until let out angled six wide into
upper stretch, closed well outside to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to score. MABEL ISLAND established the front
and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from STEAL MY HEART to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, got set
down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat and was caught in the final
strides to the finish. FAIR LASSIE chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick. CHEATHAM HILL bumped at the start by DUBLINORNOTHIN who broke out a step at the start, chased four wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and offered up a mild bid. STEAL MY HEART prompted the pace three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. ELLARELLA forwardly placed just off the inside in pursuit, got coaxed
along at the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. PENDOLINO chased four paths off the inside down
the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile out, came under coaxing with three furlongs remaining, angled out six to seven wide for home and made no
impact. IFIHADACHANCE chased two to three wide from mid pack under coaxing from the three-eighths and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
RISK TAKING took up residence in midpack after getting away in good order, was well reserved taking up the chase towards path two during the journey
leading up to the half mile pole, tipped into path three springing from that station, crept up to the front runners, was put to a drive a short distance from the
quarter pole, angled four wide for the best of racing room turning for home, chipped away at the deficit, shied a bit from a an erratic CAPO KANE snatching
away the advantage in the vicinity of the sixteenth marker, kicked well clear, kept to some encouragement to the end. OVERTOOK contently brought up the
back of the pack racing in the two path, quickened inching its way into the path three as three-quarters was being rattled off, swung out five wide for the
drive home, rallied down the center of the strip to procure the place. CAPO KANE grabbed the advantage after an alert getaway, was down along the inside
route prior to reaching the end of the homestretch, was held in reserve carving out the fractions, continued along on the front end during the run around the
far turn, got let out spinning into the lane having felt an uptick in pressure, drifted out a few paths from between the three-sixteenths pole and the sixteenth
marker, got nailed by the winner at the latter, weakened into the show slot. ROYAL NUMBER sent over to the rail, rode it for over six furlongs, got
maneuvered to the outside at the five-sixteenths pole having been let out a notch, wound up in the four path a furlong later, made no headway in the last
eighth. EAGLE ORB hung out four wide on the clubhouse bend, drew up to the pacesetter approaching the half mile pole, scooted by DONEGAL BAY and
glided into the two path at the seven-sixteenths pole, pressed the issue, was more in the path three at the commencement of the stretch run, kept at the task
at hand for another furlong before flattening out. CIVIL WAR chased the pace three wide for the initial three-quarters, lost its path to the winner at the
three-eighths pole, ventured on in path four to the upper stretch, lacked a response when asked. DONEGAL BAY forwardly placed three wide until the end
of the backstretch, worked out a tuck one path closer to the rail at the crown of the second bend, was along the inside route coming into the lane, gave out.
SHACKQUEENKING under a firm hold in the early going, faltered after undergoing a ground-saving journey. MR. DODA prominently placed two wide until
the half mile pole, steadily retreated on the far turn, went into the lane, made his way down it having been placed to a protective hold.
