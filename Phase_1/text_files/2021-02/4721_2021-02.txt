Footnotes
ROCKING REDHEAD controlled the pace early from inside, showed the way unchallenged into the stretch, urged right-handed and held safely. GO BIG
BLUE NATION traveled two wide then angled to the rail, saved ground into the stretch, rallied along the fence and got up for second. APPLECROSS (IRE)
raced two wide then tucked inside on the first turn, went outside a rival leaving the backstretch, sung five wide into the lane, drifted inward in the final furlong
and gained the show. NOBLE HEARTED was closest in pursuit early near the fence, moved out into the two path entering the second bend, took aim two
wide into the stretch, chased the winner through the final furlong but could not summon the needed late kick and was edged for the place and show. THIS
TEA was a bit rank soon after the start then settled into stride, raced along the inside then two wide into the drive and produced a mild rally. EQUAL
MEASURE stalked the pace from inside to the far turn, remained inside then entered the stretch two wide and lacked further response. HOLLYWOOD GIRL
chased along the rail through the clubhouse turn, guided off the rail on the backstretch, went three to four wide around the far turn and could not rally.
BESTRELLA (IRE) raced near the back of the field outside a rival, traveled two wide then shifted five wide nearing the stretch and never threatened.
ARCTIC ROLL (GB) tracked outside a rival then angled in on the first turn, came three wide into the lane, was bothered by outside rival mid-stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
HOCKEY DAD was off alertly then taken back to stalk the leader went three deep into the turn, three wide into the stretch, urged right-handed in upper
stretch and reeled in the runner-up under steady handling. TETON VALLEY set the pace outside a rival then cleared past the half-mile marker, inched away
into the stretch, clung to a short lead at the sixteenth pole, overtaken soon after and was clearly second best. SWIFT AS I AM chased the pace from inside
then between into the turn, exited the bend three wide, kept on through the final furlong and regained the show from SABUDA in the closing moments.
SABUDA brushed by ME LIKEY at the start, tracked three wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and got edged for the show. ME LIKEY bobbled,
broke in and brushed rival at the start, pressed the pace from inside early then chased foe past the half-mile pole, remained inside to the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ISN'T SHE LOVELY was in range off the rail then angled in nearing the turn, raced a bit off the inside then tipped outside the leader at the top of the stretch,
drew alongside and put a head in front at the eighth pole, then drove clear in deep stretch. HONEY JAR sped clear and crossed over to the inside, lost the
lead with a furlong to go and stayed on well through the final furlong. TONY ANN came in leaving the gate, traveled along the inside then a bit off the rail
into the stretch, moved back to the fence in the drive and showed a mild response to earn the show honors. GHOSTLY GAL chased off the rail then two
wide around the bend, angled out mid-stretch and improved position. NOBU stalked the leader early on, closed in leaving the backstretch, coaxed two wide
around the bend, floated out three wide upper stretch and weakened. SHORE BREAK (IRE) raced off the pace, saved ground around the bend and made
no impact. BLAME THE QUEEN came in at the start then lugged out early, trailed throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
THELUTEISMINE was away quickly from inside, sprinted to the front then cleared rivals, drew off around the turn, widened under right-handed
encouragement and won easily under hand urging in the final furlong. BIG COUPE bumped leaving the gate, lacked early speed, raced along the inside
then three wide into the lane, angled out and rallied for the place. SHOTGUN RIDER brushed by rival at the start, traveled two wide then angled to the
inside on the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and got outkicked for the place. THE ROAN RANGER bumped at the start, tracked the pace inside to the
stretch and improved position. MUSICAL GEM stalked off the rail then angled to the inside, saved ground around the bend and faded. JUNE GLOOM broke
well from outside, showed early speed outside the leader then chased the two wide into the turn, drifted out a bit around the bend and weakened.
EVENEREVENWORSE broke in and brushed rival at the start, lacked early speed, trailed three wide into the stretch and was never a factor. BRAVESTONE
propped at the start, chased the speed from outside, dropped back on the turn and tired.

CHARMAINE'S MIA had early speed outside a rival then stalked the pacesetter from outside, moved up to challenge still under a restraint at the
three-eighths, took control at the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and held well to the wire. MUCHO UNUSUAL rated early from inside, angled out
on the far turn, chased winner through the final furlong and finished willingly to hold the place. WARREN'S SHOWTIME settled off the pace, angled three
wide leaving the second bend, steered out further in the stretch and finished well to close the gap. GOING TO VEGAS broke in, stalked outside a rival then
two wide into the stretch, tipped out at the three-sixteenths pole and went evenly late for a minor award. RED LARK (IRE) bumped leaving the gate, tucked
inside on the first turn, remained inside to the stretch and summoned a mild rally in the drive. SLOANE GARDEN (GB) unhurried in the beginning, came four
wide into the stretch and never threatened. HEATHERS GREY stalked the leader outside a rival, contested the issue three deep into the far turn, chased
four wide into the lane and faded. BOHEMIAN BOURBON had speed along the rail, cleared outside rival around the first bend, showed the way up the
backstretch, vied with rivals at the three-eighths, lost command at the quarter pole and gave way. SEDAMAR broke in and bumped rival, traveled outside a
rival then angled in on the far turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
VAROMA bumped leaving the gate, settled well off the pace, closed in around the far turn, drew alongside the leader at the top of the lane, cleared that rival
and drew off in the final furlong. HERE COMES RALPHIE unhurried in the early stages, angled five wide leaving the far turn and bested the rest. MADE IN
KAROO bumped leaving the gate, chased off the inside then came four wide into the stretch and got outkicked for the place honors. SIMMER DOWN
sprinted to the front, opened up a large lead early, continued well clear into the second best, held a rapidly diminishing lead into the stretch and weakened
while churning on for a minor award. PAYNTER'S LOVE hesitated and came away to a slow beginning, went outside a rival on the backstretch, came three
wide into the drive, angled in upper stretch and improved. BACKTOFLASH tracked outside a rival then went inside a rival on the second bend and lacked a
rally. BREWED BIG off a bit slow to begin and never got involved. MALIBU JEWEL stumbled leaving the gate, was closest in pursuit through the early
stages, asked two wide around the far turn but started to weaken, tired in the lane and was eased then walked off. HATSHEPSUT fractious in the gate,
leaned back at the start and was off slow, went four wide into the first turn, stayed off the rail then was eased around the second bend, coasted through the
stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
JETOVATOR sped clear and crossed over to the inside, saved ground to the stretch, urged left-handed inside the furlong grounds and stayed clear. CRUEL
INTENTION chased the speed from inside, steadied briefly past the nine-sixteenths pole, saved ground and cut the corner into the stretch, moved out a bit
in the lane and proved second best. BEST CHANCE traveled along the inside through the turn turn, remained inside in the stretch and gained the show.
COAST OF ROAN tracked between rivals then angled four wide around the turn, kept on and gained a minor award. PSYCHO DAR showed early speed
then was forced in by JETOVATOR and checked early, chased three outside a pair of rivals then two wide into the stretch and flattened out. GOLDEN
STAR ROCK raced off the pace three deep early, went three wide into the lane and never responded to urging. SYMPHONIC checked off the heels of
COOL AS EVER early, was rated outside rivals, exited the bend three wide and could not rally. SOUTHERN HORSE (ARG) off slow and tossed head at the
start, trailed the field two wide into the drive, angled out and improved position. I GOT NO MUNNY forwardly placed between rivals, lost ground around the
turn and faded in the stretch. FANTASTIC DAY traveled inside a pair of rivals on the backstretch, angled four wide into the stretch and was never a factor.
COOL AS EVER jumped the track crossing surfaces early, raced outside a rival in mid-pack then between foes leaving the backstretch, angled in on the
turn and tired.
