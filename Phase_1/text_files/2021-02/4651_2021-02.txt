Footnotes
TORQUAY never far back to the second turn, came off the rail and eased out three deep, rallied when set down for the drive, pushed to the front in mid
stretch and edged away driving. ONLY THE FACTS pressed the leader to the second turn, rallied to engage for the lead into the stretch, was overtaken by
the winner in mid stretch but held determinedly for the place. SUMMER APPARITION had no speed, settled to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch
then shifted out and was closing belatedly. SPRING TO SUMMER chased the pace three wide to the stretch then came up empty in the drive. ANGELS
HOLIDAY hustled to the front, set the pace off the rail for six furlongs then was collared in upper stretch and tired. TOO HOT FOR CURLIN hesitated at the
start and was eight lengths last out of the gate and did not recover.

COLOUR ME HAPPY (GB) had the best speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded and held driving. UNION LEADER was unhurried
for a half, circled rivals four wide on the second turn then finished steadily and tagged CONQUEST LEMONRAID for second. CONQUEST LEMONRAID
pressed the winner three wide to the half, was off the rail on the second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch and was nailed late for second. GLENROY tracked
the pace from the rail to the stretch then was outrun to mid stretch and did not rally. KALINE never far back to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch
then also lacked a closing response. JAMMERS JUSTICE was chasing for a half mile, raced three then four wide to the stretch then weakened.

contest the pace three wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then finished evenly. MANILA MISCHIEF had no speed, raced two wide on the turn but
was outfinished in the late stages. CONCUR chased the leaders early, got fanned out to the four path to the stretch but could not offer the needed late
response. STONE GROOVE tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch then came up empty.

Footnotes
SHADRACK was content to trail to the second turn, circled rivals five then six wide to the stretch, rallied when set down, pushed to the front in mid stretch
and held driving. READY SAY GO stalked the pace from the rail to the second turn, lost position when rivals passed him to the stretch but stuck to the rail
and rallied late for the place. CLAIM OF PASSION was settled to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then shifted out and was gaining
ground willingly. POUR ON THE COLE attended the pace outside of SACRED RIDER, responded on the second turn, stayed on through a long drive but
was bested. SACRED RIDER had good speed, dueled inside of PUR ON THE COLE, got outkicked to mid stretch and was outfinished late. STRIKING A
POSE had no speed, settled mid pack, was off the rail on the second turn then lacked a closing response. FLICFLAC was four wide to the backstretch,
settled to the second turn, tried to rally three wide but came up empty in the stretch. DESCARTES tracked the pace to the second turn, was four wide to the
stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. RIVER ROSE had no speed and saved ground throughout. ON RAGLAN ROAD was chasing to
the second turn, made a run three wide to briefly get into contention then was outrun to mid stretch and gave way.
