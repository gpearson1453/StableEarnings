Footnotes
ELOQUENCE raced four wide the first two turns and took a slim lead toward the seven sixteenths pole, dueled clear midway on the far turn then dug in
under all out encouragement to just last. PERSEVERED rated the early pace inside, yielded the nod toward the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that
point, was shuffled back past the three eighths, raced boxed toward the rail most of the far turn, angled three wide to recover stride midway through the turn,
dug in under steady encouragement through the lane and just missed. BANK ON CANDY rated close about the three path then challenged at the seven
sixteenths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn but dropped back into the lane and flattened stride the final sixteenth.
THISISTHETIMETOWIN stalked the early pace off the rail, raced blocked off the heels of Persevered past the three eighths pole then recovered enough to
pass some rivals. FAVOR MAKER settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, but showed little further.
CECIL THE LION settled back off the rail early, raced outside into the backstretch and bid only mildly before flattening stride in the four path of the far turn.

RIVER CROSROAD RVF pressured the pace inside and contested the turn at a close disadvantage nearest the rail, took the lead inside the eighth pole and
dug in under steady encouragement to inch clear later yards. ADDING MACHINE angled in to set a pressured pace, was headed a furlong away and
grudgingly relented the final sixteenth. DERBY DAY DREAMS gave chase and raced in the four path of the turn, drifted into the stretch then dueled for third
while gaining mildly on the runner-up. RUSTY THE UPS MAN chased the early pace inside, rounded the turn off the rail and finished evenly. DOCTOR
MCCOY angled out to give early chase, raced in the six path on the turn then closed the gap in an even finish. AUBURN MILL chased the early pace
outside, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. HENRY STANDINGBEAR was never a factor.

DAY THE MUSIC DIED chased outside and took the lead three wide midway on the turn, dueled clear inside the sixteenth pole and held on well.
SINGANOTHERSONG brushed Union Grace on the chute then angled out to give chase, rounded the turn in the three path, dug in from the head of the
lane to take second the final yards and was gaining on the winner. CASTLE FIVE chased the pace and dueled at a close disadvantage two deep while
between horses, but dropped back mid-stretch and flattened stride later yards. FLAT RATE was bumped and made contact with Union Grace on the chute
then gave chase through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn, angled to the outside in the upper stretch and finished well. UNION GRACE was
jostled on the chute and raced well back from early contention while giving chase, rounded the turn about the five path and passed rivals down the lane.
PHONEMYPOSSEAGAIN set the pace and was pressured nearing the quarter pole, gave up the lead nearest the rail midway on the turn then weakened
inside the eighth pole. ZITARROSA came out to make contact with Flat Rate on the chute then saved ground.

Footnotes
MINDYOURPSANDQS chased the early pace outside, rounded the turn about the four path and dug in under determined handling to take the nod at the
wire. BECOMING SMITTY pressured the pace two deep and took the nod midway on the turn, dug in gamely leaving the turn but gave up the nod under the
wire. GENESIS G G chased the pace and came between horses into the stretch, dug in at even terms most of the stretch but flattened stride the final yards.
CLASSY SMITTY chased inside, exchanged contact with Ghost Mine while nearest the rail past the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at the rail and
flattened the final sixteenth. STERLING GLADIATOR chased through the backstretch and rounded the turn at the rail, angled out toward the head of the
lane and passed rivals widest. GHOST MINE chased the pace and exchanged light contact with Classy Smitty past the five sixteenths pole then weakened
while losing ground on the turn. WINDSOR'S FUN was hustled between horses to take the lead at the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace,
yielded the nod at the rail midway on the turn then gave way while steadily encouraged.
