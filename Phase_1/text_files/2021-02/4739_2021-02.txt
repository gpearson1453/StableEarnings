late gain, racing wide, but was no factor. SUCKERFORAGREY lacked early speed, improved position, but was no threat. COOL SPRING raced within
striking distance, came around the turn wide and weakened. SHE WANTS HALF raced in the middle of the pack, saved ground and faded. RACIN PRAYER

HOLY SONG vied for the early lead, dueling with SLIDE, took command leaving the final turn, pulled clear and finished well. SLIDE challenged for the early
advantage, forwardly placed throughout, couldn't match strides with HOLY SONG late, but was a clear second. BEAR TOOTH PASS pressed the pace,
raced forward throughout and proved third best. ST MARIA unhurried in the early going, racing in the rear, made a late gain, 4wide, but was no factor. OLD
TIME GIRL raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. STORM CAT'S CRY lacked early speed, moved up and faded down the home
stretch. WHISKEY TO WINE always raced near the back and was outrun. CABEZA DE TORTUGA raced within striking distance and retreated.

Footnotes
ICY CHARLIE unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the turn, rallied down the stretch and proved the best late. ITSNOTMYJOB vied
for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, but couldn't match strides with the winner deep in the stretch. DEJOKE'S SONG pressed the pace,
raced close throughout, but proved no match for the top two. AFLEET MOON raced within striking distance, put forth an even effort and was outfinished for
third. MY SISTER ANNETTE void of early speed, came around the turn wide, made a mild bid, four wide and was no factor. DUEFORADATE void of early
speed and showed little. ALOHA BETTY challenged on the front end and dropped back.

Footnotes
ROMANTIC BEAST raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn and drove clear. KLEINMEISTER pressed the pace, made a late rail bid,
proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. LEFT OF THE DIAL raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn wide, made a late bid, five
wide and finished willingly. MILANA brushed at the start, went to the front, drove clear and lacked a finish. KELLYS THE BOSS raced within striking
distance, made a bid and faded. AUDACIOUS GIRL pressed the early pace and was finished early. A WISH FOR MADELYN brushed at the start, raced in
the back and was never a factor. TENSAS SUNDAY void of early speed and showed little. ACHANCETOWIN brushed at the start, racing near the back,
came around the turn wide and was never close. MY LITTLE GUERA brushed at the start, raced in the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
ARTIST BY THE SEA reserved within contention in the early going, raced outside around the first turn, dueled with LITTLE TOE late and drove clear before
the wire. LITTLE TOE vied for the early lead, dueled on the front end throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. NASTIDA
MAST lacked early speed, came around the final turn wide, made a late gain and got up for third. QUALITY PRODUCTION pressed the pace, raced outside
around the final turn, lacked a late kick and was caught for third. VICTOR LOUNGE (IRE) raced near the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort.
MR. GRACEFUL raced in the middle of the field, came around the final turn four wide and finished evenly. APALACHEE BAY dueled for the early
advantage and dropped back. PERFECT PARADE raced in the middle of the field and faded. SO SORRY RUSTON always raced in the back and showed
little. DUTCHMAN trailed throughout and was outrun.
