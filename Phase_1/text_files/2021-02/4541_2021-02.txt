Footnotes
ARCTIC GUITAR unhurried in the early going, moved up, took the lead around the final turn, dueled briefly with SOUVENIR CHANNEL down the lane and
pulled away. SOUVENIR CHANNEL raced near the back in the beginning, made a bid around the second turn, challenged ARCTIC GUITAR for the lead,
couldn't keep up with him, but was best of rest. PARTY WITH KASSIDY raced evenly near the back in the early part, showed late interest and was along for
third. FEARLESS DIXIE pressed the early pace and weakened. COZZENE ZING went to the front, drove clear, faded and finished evenly near the back.
NATIVE TRIP pressed the early pace and dropped back. MAY BLOSSOM always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
SHIP STALKER unhurried in the early part, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out entering the home stretch and was going away at the
end. MAGNANIMUS MAN sprinted to the front, drove clear, led until deep in the stretch, couldn't match strides with the winner, but was best of others.
FORGOTTEN COAST raced in the back of the field in the beginning, entered the home stretch wide, made a late gain, but was no match for the top two.
STUART HALL broke out, brushed rival, pressed the early pace and weakened. DONWELL raced within striking distance and faded. SWEEPING EDGE
brushed at the start, racing in the back, moved up and lacked a finish. BLUE BOMBER pressed the early pace and dropped back.

Footnotes
HATTIES JEWEL raced in the middle of the field, entered the home stretch wide and drove clear down the lane. CANTRELL HILL raced within striking
distance, moved up on the inside around the final turn, checked, blocked, came through on the rail and closed fast. FREDONIAN lacked early speed, made
a steady gain, rallied four wide down the stretch and got up for third. TROY OUNCE pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late
kick. ZYPTO dueled for the early lead, saved ground and weakened. DREAMONMEBABY raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even effort.
BUXTERHOOTER raced in the back of the pack, moved up, but was no factor. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE pressed the early pace, saved ground around the
second turn and made a steady retreat. CRIMSON ZIP challenged for lead, steadied slightly around the final turn, dropped back and was no threat late.
CALCULATE always raced near the back and was outrun. THE TRAINER OF #3 ZYPTO LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #5 CANTRELL HILL FOR
INTERFERENCE AT THE HEAD OF THE LANE. AFTER VIEWING RPLAY STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.
