wire. MAKE ME SMILE was an early factor, raced close throughout, dueled down the final stretch, couldn't match strides with MR PRODUCTION, but
proved best of others. GALAXY BUILDER raced within striking distance, saved ground around the second turn, proved no match for the top two, but held on
for show. MR MAKEITHAPPEN raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, showed late interest and was outfinished for third. HALF OURS N STORMY
pressed the early pace, faded and was no threat late. MAY HOUR raced within striking distance, dropped back and was outrun.

SURF KITTEN sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won under steady urging. MY SISTER ANNETTE pressed the pace, forwardly placed
throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. NAUGHTY ME raced in the back in the beginning, came around the turn on the rail,
made a bid down the stretch and was just up for third. EMMPORT raced within contention, came around the turn wide and was caught for show. CRISPY
CREED raced evenly near the back, came around the turn wide and was never a factor. DR LIZ void of early speed and was never a threat.

end. WORLD PARTY raced within contention, took the lead early in the home stretch, but couldn't match strides with the winner. PI YO PRINCESS pressed
the pace, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for second. RESPOSADO went to the front, drove clear, saved ground around the final turn and
weakened. SWEET SHELIA raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, showed late interest, but was no factor. SHACKS RIVER pressed the early pace
and faded. AWESOMELOVEOFDEORO challenged for the early advantage, saved ground and was finished early. KLEINMEISTER void of early speed and

early speed, raced wide around the final turn, gained ground, but proved no match for the top two. NOMOREQUESTIONS raced near the middle of the field,
made a mild bid, but was no factor. JACK'S KISS pressed the early pace, weakened and lacked a finish. SINGINGINTHEWIND raced in the middle of the
pack and put forth an even effort. TONIGHTS STAR void of early speed and was never close. G CISIVE challenged for the early lead, saved ground and
dropped back. KISS OF THE WOLF pressed the early pace and was finished early.

Footnotes
QUEEN SHASTA vied for the early lead, forward throughout, dueled down the stretch, bumped rival and prevailed for the win. AREYOUINABAND
challenged for the lead, close throughout, bumped, while dueling down the stretch and was outfinished for the win. SHE'S THE BOSS unhurried in the early
part, raced wide around the turn, made a late gain, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. WISH FOR INTEREST raced near the middle of the
field and put forth an even effort. EUROBOUTTOGETIT pressed the early pace and weakened. GABBY'S FREEDOM raced in the back of the pack in the
beginning and was never a threat. SARA'S FLASH always raced near the back and was outrun. MALLORY'S HOME showed brief speed and retreated to
the rear.
