Footnotes
GREAT GO GO cleared early, set a rated pace towards the rail, was nudged along past the five sixteenths, opened up nearing mid stretch, came under a
strong drive soon after and lasted. JUSTICE OF WAR saved ground early while in range, eased back off rivals heading to the turn, angled out and came five
wide into the lane, straightened away and had his bold run fall just short. SCORESWHENHEWANTS drafted back off the early pace, gave three wide
pursuit nearing the lane, altered in near the three sixteenths, came back out for the final furlong and churned on willingly. PYSER'S ORB broke a step slow,
was sent up between rivals early, chased two wide and to the inside of a rival nearing the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and faltered.
REDACTED REPORT , four wide outside rivals chasing the winner, remained wide around the turn and faltered in upper stretch. WHISKEY DREAMIN ,
sluggish from the gate, was outrun.

Footnotes
ACADIAN GIRL , away alertly, tracked the pace three to four wide, moved to command after a half mile, kicked clear with little effort around the turn, opened
up a commanding lead under some asking in mid stretch then cruised home the final seventy yards. MIKEY'S JEWEL broke a bit slow then settled off the
pace while saving ground, angled out with some momentum into the lane, split rivals in mid stretch and continued on with good energy. IRISH BRANDI , off
the early pace and removed from the rail, circled five wide making some headway into the stretch then flattened out. USED TO BE FUN chased three wide
around the turn and faded. BOB'S LADY , two wide making a mild early run between rivals, pursued the winner into the lane then gave way. AUNT MARY
prompted the early pace, bid between runners entering the far turn, failed to keep up past the three eighths and retreated. QUEEN KARMA was used hard
from the gate and advanced inside horses to go clear, was collared approaching the half mile marker and faltered.

Footnotes
THE WALK showed speed along the inner rail, eased out leaving the backstretch, gained a two wide lead near the three eighths pole and pulled away
through the stretch while under urging. NO MORE TALK sprinted clear soon after the break, angled in to set the pace along the rail, lost the lead near the
three eighths pole, swung out in upper stretch and weakened. THE QUANTICO KID , three wide on the turn, chased the pace, floated to the four path in
upper stretch and weakened. BOZZINI saved ground on the turn, drifted off the rail in mid stretch and lacked a rally. BIG BOOTS , unhurried down the
backstretch, was taken to the four path turning for home and was never a factor. BALLIVOR hesitated at the break, saved ground on the turn, drifted to the
two path in upper stretch, was taken back to the inner rail near the eighth pole and was not a factor. GLENGAR , four deep on the turn, gave way.

Footnotes
GRAVITY'S RAINBOW , quickly to contention between rivals, prompted the pace three wide outside LIKELY CHOICE, moved alongside with three furlongs
remaining, secured command approaching the stretch, opened up under strong handling in mid stretch and was kept to solid asking to the wire. ASBUILT
was steadied at the break, recovered and edged up between foes, dropped in nearing the turn, came back out to take aim past the three eighths, gave hard
chase five wide into the lane and continued well while holding down the place. KIRTAN , away alertly, chased well off the inside, circled five wide into the
lane and churned on with some interest. INDIAN HEART , off the pace while saving some ground, came out mid turn and offered a mild kick. DOOR
BUSTER , six wide nearing the half mile marker, dropped in some around the turn, raced three wide in upper stretch but needed more between rivals.
KITSIE lagged off the pace, angled six wide for the drive but failed to generate a solid response. LIKELY CHOICE sped clear early and set the pace off the
rail, dropped in nearing the turn, could not shake the winner past the three eighths, stayed willingly to mid stretch then weakened.

OXIDE sprinted to the early lead, set the pace in the two path, opened up in mid stretch and held sway under urging. BYBEE , three wide chasing the pace
around the turn, drifted out a bit entering the stretch and rallied gamely outside the winner. ROUGH SEA saved ground on the turn, angled off the rail for the
drive, worked between horses and rallied. HANALEI'S HOUDINI , taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, advanced inside horses to the eighth
pole then weakened. FED FUNDS lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn, angled out a bit in the stretch and failed to rally. PARADISE PRIDE , five
deep on the turn, was fanned to the six path entering the stretch and was not a factor. BOBBY G , no factor, raced four wide on the turn. SAINTLY
SAMURAI , four wide chasing the pace on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
HYDRA broke sharp and disputed the pace inside a pair of rivals, moved to a slim lead past the five sixteenths, emerged in a battle with VICS COOL CAT
heading to the furlong grounds, switched over to her left lead near the sixteenth marker and dug in tenaciously under strong handling. VICS COOL CAT got
in a scrum between rivals soon after the break, fought on outside the winner from the three sixteenths, shied from that rival's whip inside the furlong grounds
and kept on valiantly to the line. COMBAT QUEEN dropped in nearing the turn and raced in range of the dueling trio, angled five wide making some
progress into the stretch, had aim past the eighth pole but could only muster up a slight late kick. MAP OF AMERICA dueled three deep on a short early
lead, continued a presence to the three sixteenths then faded. INDY TAKES CHARGE chased the leaders two wide past the five sixteenths and came up
empty. KASHAN , four to six wide, stayed in touch to upper stretch then faded.

Footnotes
MO AMERICAN , reserved early, hugged the inner rail on the far turn, swung wide in upper stretch, closed outside horses, took the lead late and drove
clear. BRIGHTWOOD chased the pace racing in the two path and finished willingly. HINTING set the pace along the rail and faltered near the sixteenth
pole. ORBONTHEBAYOU , three wide the first turn, raced in the two path on the far turn and weakened. COMPASS COURSE , lacked speed, raced wide
on the far turn and was not a factor. KING PACAY , under urging soon after the break, was five deep on the first turn and retreated into the far turn. THE
FIRE WITHIN raced in the four path on the first turn and faltered.
