CHARGING HOME was chasing the pace from the rail to the stretch, lacked room inside in upper stretch, shifted out then again was blocked in mid stretch,
shifted out again and rallied once clear to wear down SHARP MOVE late. SHARP MOVE pressed GIFTY two wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms, dug
in to inch away a sixteenth out but could not stall the winner. GIFTY set the pace from the rail to the stretch, dug in when hooked in mid stretch but was
weakening in the final sixteenth. HEAT SEEKING LETA got outsprinted early, raced two wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response.
TIM'S STREET GIRL was also chasing the pace while three wide to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. TIZAPEPPER had no speed and was not
a threat.

HE BE MOJO RISIN never far back to the second turn, bid between rivals and two wide then shifted out for room into the stretch, rallied when set down and
pushed clear to the line. ROUEN set the pace early then dueled inside of LORD VADER, was two wide to the stretch, dug in determinedly to the sixteenth
pole then could not hold off the winner. LORD VADER attended the pace for six furlongs while three wide, continued to respond to mid stretch but was
weakening in the late stages. ROBBER BARON broke out then was corrected but had no speed and saved ground throughout but never rallied.
STATEFOREST was three then four wide while stalking to the half, remained three wide to the stretch then tired in the final furlong.

did not rally. AND DO WHEN veered inward at the start, was corrected but had no speed and was always outrun.

Footnotes
HARMON was four wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then was blocked briefly in upper stretch but shifted
out in mid stretch, rallied when clear and prevailed driving. MITHQAAL attended the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to deep stretch then could
not stall the winner but bested FUENTE (GB) for the place. FUENTE (GB) was on the pace from the outset, dueled two wide to the stretch, dug in to mid
stretch but was outfinished in the late stages. ORCZY (IRE) had no speed, advanced two wide on the second turn to loom a threat into the stretch, stayed to
mid stretch then finished evenly. SWEET RIVER BAINES trailed to the second turn, circled four then five wide to the stretch, made a run to mid stretch then
flattened out. KLONDIKE CREEK tracked the leaders for six furlongs while four wide but got outrun to mid stretch and weakened. BIG HOOF DYNAMITE
was chasing for a half mile then saved ground on the second turn but gave out in the drive.

Footnotes
MY SUNSHINE was a bit rank off heels early, settled on the backstretch, bid two wide into the second turn then swung out four deep into the stretch, rallied
to the front in mid stretch and edged away driving. FRIDAY'S AT SHADY was also settled for a half mile, raced three wide at the three eighths then was
forced out five deep into the stretch, did not threaten the winner but was second best. UNPOSSIBLE stalked the pace to the second turn, made a bid four
wide to get on terms, was outkicked in upper stretch and finished evenly. LITTLE JOHN had no speed, trailed to the second turn, was off the rail to the
stretch then swung out widest but did not rally. KYLEMORE pushed to the front, was off the rail to the second turn, got overtaken to the stretch and tired.
KING EDDIE pressed KYLEMORE to the second turn, bid three wide to engage for the lead briefly but was outkicked to mid stretch and tired. MOONLIGHT
BLUE had no speed, raced three then four wide to the stretch but was never a threat.

Footnotes
ROMBAUER was content to trail to the second turn, swung out four wide for room, rallied when set down for the drive and closed steadily to nab JAVANICA
late. JAVANICA never far back to the second turn, bid four wide and rallied to engage for the lead in mid stretch, edged away leaving the furlong grounds
then could not hold off the winner while easily second best. GOVENOR'S PARTY was allowed to settle to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch but
could not impact the top two. IT'S MY HOUSE set the pace to the half, saved ground to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then tired. WASPIRANT
tracked the leader to the second turn then saved ground but weakened through the drive. PETRUCHIO pressed the pace for six furlongs while two wide
then gave way. TESORO had no speed and was not a factor. PLAY CHICKEN was five wide to the backstretch, stalked to the second turn then tired and
gave way.
