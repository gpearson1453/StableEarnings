Footnotes
GONE PREACHIN was shuffled back at the break, settled off the early pace, made a strong move around the far turn and was well clear late under steady
handling. HOLIDAY MAN stalked the pace, raced three wide in the lane and was no match for the winner. DOMINANTE was forwardly placed to lay up
close in the early stages, raced five wide at the eighth pole and had no final winning bid. RULETHENIGHT showed good speed along the inside and
weakened in the stretch. CATARUSKY pressed the pace from the inside and weakened. MR RED SENSATION was in tight at the break, raced six wide into
the upper stretch and never was a factor.`. BE STORMY was bumped at the break, raced in tight quarters early and never threatened.
