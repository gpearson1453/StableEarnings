Footnotes
VALUED NOTION , briefly steadied near the five and a half furlongs pole, stalked the pace, circled foes on the turn, was four deep entering the stretch,
drifted in in front of RAHMER near the eighth pole, drifted in despite left hand urging near the sixteenth pole and drew out under urging.
TRUSTYOURINSTINCT sprinted clear entering the turn, set the pace along the rail and was steadied when placed in tight quarters by VALUED NOTION
near the sixteenth pole. RAHMER , lightly steadied in some traffic soon after the break, prompted the pace two wide and weakened in the drive.
CHAUFFEUR hugged the inner rail and gave way entering the turn. An objection by the rider of TRUSTYOURINSTINCT against VALUED NOTION for
interference in the stretch drive was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch drive but no action was taken.

Footnotes
BLUE SKY PAINTER settled outside a rival, angled out mid turn with run, ranged up four wide into the lane, responded when roused soon after, took over
inside the three sixteenths, turned back a threat from PAY THE KID in mid stretch then widened while kept to task. BIG RINNE , in range early on while off
the rail, came under some coaxing mid turn, altered out nearing mid stretch and came back willingly to garner the place. PAY THE KID , under a snug hold
while saving ground, swung five wide into the lane, range up to loom a major threat in mid stretch then flattened out late. GLORIOUS WEEKEND prompted
the pace outside QUEST OF GLORY, moved alongside around the turn, failed to kick on under pressure past the three sixteenths and faded. QUEST OF
GLORY grabbed command at once then dropped in to set a slower pace, handled outside pressure around the turn, spurted clear under asking in upper
stretch, could not resist the winner soon after then weakened through the final seventy yards. CATCH YA LATER BRO , taken to rate while saving ground
and behind rivals, remained behind foes into the lane and past mid stretch, eased out some but came up empty.

Footnotes
LUXERO set a pressured pace along the inner rail and pulled away through the stretch while ridden out. MOONZANO , three deep around the turn, chased
the pace, failed to threaten the winner and passed a tired rival inside the eighth pole. CAPTAIN CARDO lacked speed, raced along the inner rail the final
three sixteenths of a mile and rallied. MAGIC OF LOVE prompted the pace two wide and faded the final furlong. ZOINKS SCOOBY , never a factor, raced in
the two path leaving the turn. GONNA WIN IT raced along the inner rail on the turn while outrun. RUNBACK trailed.

TWEET AWAY ROBIN prompted two to three wide outside the leader and under a snug hold, moved to a short lead past the three eighths, held off a threat
from BLUE SKY VENEZUELA past the five sixteenths, eagerly kicked away under a drive in mid stretch then held firm late. INTROSPECTION settled three
wide nearing the half mile marker, angled out for the drive and finished with good energy to bridge the gap. CHINA CAT lagged well back through the
opening half mile, swung five wide entering the stretch, straightened away and closed steadily. BLUE SKY VENEZUELA , three wide between rivals in close
attendance, bid four wide outside the winner mid turn, pressed into the lane, stayed well to mid stretch then faded. POLISHED GAL , off the pace, saved
ground into the lane but lacked a bid. JOYFUL NOISE rated inside, eased out to take closer order past the five sixteenths, pursued into the lane then gave
way in the final sixteenth. GREASEDLIGHTNING , in mid pack, raced towards the inside in upper stretch but failed to make an impact. MAJESTIC PIC lost
ground four wide, gave pursuit to the quarter pole then retreated. STARTING TOUR sped to the front, set a pressured pace inside, ceded command leaving
the far turn, could not keep pace past the five sixteenths, faltered and was eased late.

WHIRLIN CURLIN , three wide the first turn, raced outside horses down the backstretch and on the far turn, angled to the four path approaching the stretch,
gained command in upper stretch and drew off while kept to his business. MONKEY'S MEDAL , along the inner rail around the first turn, was three wide
between horses leaving the far turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. FEATURE ACT stalked the pace, raced in the two path
the far turn, worked between horses in the stretch and rallied mildly. EARNED IT , outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn four deep,
floated to the six path in upper stretch and was never a factor. CHEYENNE BULL , two wide leaving the far turn, raced between horses in the stretch and
failed to rally. PIPES , caught in tight quarters entering the first turn, stalked the pace, was well placed three deep on the far turn and faded the final furlong.
FAST MASTER , gained a two wide lead on the backstretch, opened a clear advantage on the far turn and gave way in the drive. ACROSS THE AISLE was
outrun. IWISHIWASPECIAL , rank leaving the starting gate, sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail and tired leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
MY MAN POTS N PANS , patiently handled about four wide, took closer order between rivals while in hand mid turn, eased out a bit and responded when
sent five wide between horses into the lane, spurted clear and shifted in towards the rail past the three sixteenths, widened a bit past the eighth pole then
had plenty left to hold sway. BOUNCING AROUND broke a step slow, was sent up to the inside of rivals near the three quarter pole, eased out around the
turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch and finished with good energy to gain. GREEK PRINCE stalked inside, eased out some mid turn, bid between
runners to threaten near the quarter pole, gave hard chase of the winner past mid stretch and kept on with effort. DECORATED , three wide between rivals
and in close attendance, disputed the issue from the far turn to upper stretch, failed to match strides near the three sixteenths, pursued then faded a bit late.
RUNNER RUNNER INDY , rated off the rail, moved up some mid turn, angled seven wide into the lane but lacked a solid finish. BELLARMINE HALL was
hung out five wide stalking the leaders, came under pressure, was fanned six wide into the lane and gave way. TOM TERRIFIC disputed the pace between
foes, took over leaving the far turn, battled to upper stretch then weakened. NO FOOLING DUDE took over inside rivals early on, dueled from the three
quarter pole to about the head of the stretch then tired.

FANCY PRINCESS bore in leaving the starting gate, was taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, was in hand while saving ground around the
turn, eased out in upper stretch, swept to command under urging outside GOLDEN LASSIE near the sixteenth and drew clear. GOLDEN LASSIE bore in at
the break, sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and weakened late. POLISH COOKIE raced in the three path between horses around the turn
and finished willingly. DARLING'S CURE , bumped leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four deep and finished well. SAME MOON , in the two path
between horses chasing the pace to mid turn, faded in the stretch. LOVE MY CAT , forced in leaving the starting gate, raced three wide into the stretch and
was not a factor. LEMON DROP KISS bobbled at the break then was outrun. BRIEF REACTION dropped back.

Footnotes
FUGITIVE rated off of a contested pace, moved up three outside a rival into the lane, worked between foes on his left lead past mid stretch, took over with a
sixteenth to go then edged away. MARTINI LANE , towards the inside, edged up past the eighth pole, challenged soon after then churned on willingly.
DEGAS pulled his way forward outside rivals leaving the five eighths, bid outside the leader with a half to go, vied around the turn, was carried six wide into
the lane, straightened and continued to battle past the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly. GOODLUCKJOHNATHAN , four wide mid turn, altered
widest past the furlong grounds and kept on with interest. VISUAL ARTIST broke a step slow, steadied behind rivals nearing the half mile pole, saved
ground around the turn then lacked a solid stretch kick. PUSH TO START sped clear soon after the break, set a rated pace towards the rail, was joined
nearing the turn, took pressure, wandered out to about the five path entering the lane, corrected and maintained a slim advantage past mid stretch then
gave in past the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
DISPUTED NOTION stalked the pace while two wide on the turn, eased out to the four path in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside horses, led late
then drove clear. MAGIC MULE advanced three wide leaving the turn, challenged for the lead outside BANG BANG entering the stretch, dueled with that
one and weakened in the drive. BANG BANG hugged the inner rail, dueled through the stretch and weakened. DESPITE ODDS , rated leaving the
backstretch, circled the turn three wide, floated to the six path in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. MR. MIMS , two wide chasing the pace around
the turn, weakened in the drive. HONOR MY WORLD , along the inner rail on the turn, was not a factor. TRACER lacked speed, raced in the two path on
the turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch and lacked a response.
