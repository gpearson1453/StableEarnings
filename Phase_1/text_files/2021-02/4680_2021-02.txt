Footnotes
PARK MANAGER MAIZE was content to lag inside, rallied two wide into the stretch, angled to the rail, took over leaving the furlong grounds and drew out
through the final sixteenth. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE stalked outside the early leader, raced the three path around the final turn, gave her best entering the
final furlong but couldn't stay with the winner. MARTHA'S MISCHIEF bobbled slightly while breaking sharply, made the pace along the rail into the final
furlong then faded from between the top two. GABBY'SGOLDENVOICE had early position inside, ran out entering the stretch, stopped and was eased up.
ALLEYESFOLLOWBELLE was outrun. SPECIAL LOVE stopped and was eased up. ACT OF COURAGE lost contact with the field after a half and was
eased up.

Footnotes
SAVAGERY took command at once, drifted out on the backstretch, stayed out from the rail once clear on the turn and was under intermittent urging through
the lane. FUTILE fell back along the inside on the backstretch then rallied the rail through the final quarter. THOMAS KNIGHT was squeezed back from
between horses leaving the gate, made a strong run along the rail around the turn, angled out entering the stretch and flattened out. EYES ON ME ducked
out into PAGE DOWN leaving the gate, made a two wide run between horses around the turn, angled out entering the stretch and tired. CACTUS JACK had
early position outside, raced the four path around the turn and stopped. PAGE DOWN was bumped into THOMAS KNIGHT leaving the gate, moved to
press outside the early leader, raced three wide around the turn and stopped. CAPT. GRIDER was finished early.

Footnotes
BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD was never far back outside, moved to vie three wide on the final turn, drew out in early stretch and held under urging. STRAW
HAT was slow early, raced the two path around the final turn and finished willingly between rivals. STEADY ROCK made the early pace along the inside and
tired in the lane. SECRET ACCOUNT stalked the early leader, moved two wide to command into the far turn then tired in the lane. MISS AL DILA had good
position along the rail and tired in the lane. CASEYOUDIDN'TKNOW made a three wide run around the final turn and flattened out in the lane.
GRACEYGAB was no factor. THERE GOES MY GIRL was outrun. WICKED T bobbled leaving the gate then trailed.

ZERTZ moved clear from the outside before going a quarter, stayed out from the rail and widened under mild urging. DOLLARIZATION went in the air in the
gate at the break, the rider had to pull her goggles down from her helmet soon after, rushed up outside early, was urged three wide around the turn and tired
in the lane. HERE'S WALDO advanced the rail on the backstretch then faded. AMERICAN CHESTNUT chased the winner into the turn then stopped.
TRIBAL NOTION was outrun. BERMONDSEY broke sharply for the early advantage and was finished early.

NORTHERN THUNDER angled to the outside while not far back on the backstretch, moved three wide to a short lead midway on the final turn and edged
clear at the end of a long drive. THUNDER GRUNDER broke slowly, steadied along the rail when caught behind the first flight on the final turn, swung wide
into the stretch, tried outside the winner through the lane but wasn't enough. SMIRK made the pace along the rail into the far turn, remained prominent
inside the top two into the final furlong then weakened. AHSAD pressed two wide outside the early leader and faded in the drive. HOUSE ARREST wasn't
far back to the far turn then stopped. STARRY SKY was outrun. LUCKY LOVER BOY was finished early. GOOD GOOD was caught wide around the first
turn, stopped and was eased up through the stretch.
