Footnotes
JACK'S ADVANTAGE set a pressured pace while inside, was in a long sustained drive throughout and gamely held sway in the final strides. CANTRELL
HILL stalked the pace while three wide on the backstretch, rallied on the far turn and lugged in slightly in mid stretch and gamely dug in but just missed in
the end. BANDIT SWANSON was stalking the pace while inside on the backstretch, was in good position into the far turn then started to make a run, was
blocked behind the leaders in mid stretch twice and was probably best in the end. TAPIT WISE was unhurried early then rallied and was four wide in the
stretch but was no threat in the end. HOUR CITY pressed the pace while two wide on the backstretch, was in a long drive then squeezed in upper stretch
and faltered in mid stretch. EARNEDNEVERGIVEN was unhurried early then failed to menace. JUST ASK JOEL stalked the early pace while four wide on
the backstretch, was used up then gave way. OFF TRACK was allowed to settled then failed to menace. MILLWOOD was unhurried early while inside and
was no threat. A steward's inquiry was held concerning the stretch drive. After reviewing the film's, no action was taken.
