Footnotes
CONQUISTADOR SHOW broke with leaders prompted pace in the two path, continued to apply pressure through some soft splits up the backstretch,
dueled into the stretch, long drive, wore rival down under steady handling. EPIC ADVENTURE broke on top, clear into the first turn while under stout
restraint, set a soft set of fractions the middle half while still firmly in hand, responded when asked turning for home, dueled to the wire, gave ground
grudgingly to the winner while inside that one. MR. PETERKIN settled off the pace in the three path first turn, bit closer and moved out four wide for the run
up the backstretch, continued in the four path through the second bend, mild interest while remaining widest in the drive, fully extended to gain the show
while slowly carving into the top two's margin at the end. TIZ THE JOURNEY broke back, four wide when off the pace in the first turn, in some traffic in the
two when moving slightly closer late in the second turn, outkicked in the late going for the show. WESTERN PHAROAH settled off the pace, remained in
second flight just off the inside while rated, asked along and moved a bit closer. PONTI POKER off a bit slow, tracked the pace three then backed up in the
drive to finish well back.

BLANCO BRONCO back off the pace and the inside, floated out six wide turning into the stretch, rallied midtrack, drifted, up late. TEN BUDS away well, set
the pace inside, vied through the turn while remaining along the inside, shook clear when straightened for home, continued to hold daylight inside the furlong
grounds, drifted out late, caught final strides. BRAVURA CREEK in the second flight while racing toward the inside, two path through the turn, displayed
some mild late interest to finish up best of the rest. YOUNG BULL pressed the pace while off the inside, vied between foes and outside the runner up
through the turn, weakened in the drive. BANK MAN dwelt at the start, void of early foot, came four wide out of the turn, in some traffic, brief wait, altered
course to the outside soon after, mild interest. IT'S BELLAMY TIME when one paced while three wide throughout. BOO BE RIGHT pressed the pace while
three wide and between horses, faltered in the drive. SHOOT ME STRAIGHT off a step slow, raced back and off the inside, four wide through the turn,
lacked a serious response in the drive. SMELLIN CANDY prompted the pace while four wide, gave way in the drive. LISTEN TO ROSE remained always

Footnotes
LAURIEANN closest to the leader while racing in the two path, continued to prompt that rival the middle half, edged closer late in the final turn, put a head iin
front entering the stretch and drew clear under steady handling. FOREVERNOA broke with the field, took command into the first turn, set the pace while
continuing to save ground, offered brief resistance to the winner entering the stretch, could not match that one in the run to the wire, saved the place. SHE'S
DIVINE lacked early foot, improved the middle half, came three wide into the stretch, did not have enough late for the place. SEEDS OF TIME angled out to
be four wide in the first turn, continued outside, four wide again in the second bend, came up empty for the drive. HELLO DARLING in mid pack early inside,
continued to save some ground second turn, finished up evenly through the. POTRA LIZA last away, two path first turn, saved ground to no avail through
the second bend to be never a threat. FLATOUTANDFOXY was finished early, never a factor. RAHWAY within striking distance for a half, gave way after
racing three wide.

Footnotes
DUSTY HILL broke sharp, cleared soon after, showed the way through the turn by daylight, continued to show the way by an expanding advantage when he
ducked toward the rail upper stretch, extended advantage when straightened under a left handed crop. MO BETTA broke well, raced in the second group
outside, four wide through the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, proved game for the place while remaining well out in the strip. FORSAKEN
bumped at the start, raced behind the winner in the two path, also could do little with that one through the stretch, outkicked late for the place. TRAFFIC
CONTROL in some traffic after the start then steadied early, settled toward the inside turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing kick. J'S
LITTLE MAN within striking distance in the second flight and off the inside, three wide into the lane, came up empty when called on for the drive. KAT'S
HITMAN back off the early pace, moved down toward the inside to save some ground through the turn, failed to muster a rally. TWISTED DIXIE settled in
mid pack while racing outside, five wide through the turn, lacked response drive. BROADWAY JERRY off slow, raced back and four wide through the turn,
made little impact in the drive. I STAN FOR LOVE bumped start, failed to menace. STOMPING HOTROD chased the winner for a half inside and gave way.
STRATEGIC AFFAIR remained always back to be outrun. DUCKTAIL fell back after the start, was never a threat.

Footnotes
HARDLY A SECRET in the second flight while off the inside early, angled out to be four wide onto the backstretch, went after the leader into the far turn,
collared that rival late in that bend, drew well clear while under a firm left handed crop. TASHKENT closest to the early leader through the first turn, chased
up the backstretch off the inside, came three wide into the lane, could do little with the winner in the final furlong, clearly second best. KRISTO settled off the
pace and the inside, three wide through the second turn, went evenly through the lane, saved the show late. STUART HALL broke out to bother an outer
rival, lacked early foot off the inside, raced three wide through the second turn, staged a mild rally to improve position, not enough late for the show.
GOSPEL ABE saved ground when off the pace in the first turn, moved out to race four wide through the second bend, went evenly through the stretch.
FORT RIDGE bothered at the start to be last away, was asked a bit to clear four wide into the first turn, maintained a sizable advantage the middle half, saw
that advantage shrink to the winner in the far turn, gave way when headed by that one into the stretch. TAPITOR lacked speed, saved ground much of the
way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. ICE CRUSH remained always back. CALCULATED RISKER raced in mid pack, tired while three
out to four wide into the stretch. FLASHYMEISTER chased early, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
TORIN closest to the leader just off the inside, challenged from the outside turning for home, dueled past the furlong marker, proved narrowly best while fully
extended in the late going after brushing with the runner up. QUALITY WARRIOR broke alertly, cleared soon after, continued to show the way through the
turn and into the stretch, responded when the winner came alongside into the stretch, dueled past the furlong marker inside that one, proved stubborn to the
end while brushing with the winner, well clear for the place. JACK LUVS NOVA off slowly while rank, well back early, began to advance midway on the turn,
finished up willingly inside of traffic through the stretch. CASCADE KING in some traffic when off the pace into and through much of the turn, four wide into
the stretch, went evenly through the stretch. STONE SECRET within striking distance early outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick.
BEAUCETTE'S EKATI settled in mid pack off the inside, four wide exiting the bend, went one paced through the stretch in also lacked a late punch. LOOKIT
away in good order, forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch while between foes, gradually faded down the stretch. LITTLE CHIEF off a step slow,
moved early to race in mid pack, had little left for the drive. COACH DAN five wide trip when off the pace, had nothing for the drive. NAVEEN off a step slow,
remained always back. DRYSPELL off slow, moved up inside to race in the main body, began a steady fade just before a half.

Footnotes
CABOT stalked the early pace under confident handling, ranged up four wide turning for home, kicked clear under steady handling. POLAR WIND last
away, raced back early just off the inside, swung out four to five wide turning for home, finished willingly out in the middle of the strip to be getting to the
winner late, well clear of the others. LONELY PRIVATE forwardly placed while racing outside, three wide through the turn, proved no match for the top two
in the drive, narrowly gained the nod for the show. ALEX'S STRIKE broke back, three wide into the turn, came four wide into the lane, staged a mild rally,
missed the show. LULLABY BLING lacked speed for a half, waited briefly behind traffic turning for home, improved position with some moderate late interest
when clear for the drive. MAJOR ATTRACTION raced in mid pack while four wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive. NEWS FLASH vied up
front while between horses for four furlongs, weakened when the real running began turning for home. ALL EYES WEST four wide into the turn, had little left
for the drive. BULLION made little impact while racing just off the inside. NASHVEGAS narrowly set the pace a half along the inside, stopped through the
stretch.

Footnotes
ONE FOR RICHIE pressed the issue early while three wide and in hand, vied while continuing on the outside of the first flight through the turn, asked a bid
when straightened for home, strongly clear without being asked for his best to win ridden out. BANDIT POINT void of early foot, saved some ground into the
turn, swung out widest turning for home, finished willingly down the center of the strip to be in time for the place. KADRI pressed the issue from between
horses in the run up the backstretch, raced on equal terms while remaining between rivals and inside the winner turning for home, proved no match in the
run to the wire, caught late for the place. BANK went one paced behind the first flight off the inside, three wide into the lane, lacked a closing response.
FASTLY set the early pace along the inside, weakened when headed turning for home. ROB THE RICH last to leave, never menaced. THOMAS SHELBY
was finished early in a dull effort. ABUNDANT broke out, raced four wide through the turn, tired in the drive.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE LORIN with the pace in the first turn, allowed the leader to go the middle half under patient handling, rebid in the three path far turn, shook
clear, held the runner up comfortably safe late under steady handling. TRUMPET LILLY in some traffic into the first turn firmly in hand, remained within
striking distance, four wide into the far turn, set down for the drive, could not get to the winner late while well clear for the place. MARION FRANCIS settled
behind the early pace, surged to the front with a strong middle move to be clear into the far turn, faltered when confronted for the drive, narrowly salvaged
the show. PRINCESS LEA went one paced in the three path in lacking a closing response. STILLCHARGINGMARIA void of speed along the inside, saved
ground to no avail while also coming up empty in the drive. CLASS REUNION last to leave, checked up off a rival's heels into the first turn, remained back in
failing to threaten. SILVER BANSHEE a bit rank when forward into the first turn, cleared after a quarter, stopped when headed into the far turn.
