Footnotes
BLUEBERRY MASH took command at once, ran out entering the first turn, began to draw off nearing the end of the backstretch and widened under mild
urging. UNORTHODOX was forced wide while chasing three wide into the first turn, remained close for about six furlongs then stopped. MOON MEISTER
was forced out entering the first turn, remained prominent two wide between horses into the far turn then stopped. GOLDEN ZAR made a quick move along
the rail on the backstretch to reach contention and was finished soon after. ACT OF COURAGE quickly lost contact.

POCOPSON STATION was slow early, circled into the stretch, finished fast and was along in time. I B CHARLY was slow early, raced two wide between
horses into the stretch, angled out sharply entering the final furlong, closed willingly and was up for the place. TRAVELIN GAMBLER showed speed from
the outside, moved two wide to a clear lead early on the turn, held gamely into deep stretch then gave way. TALENTED SON was slow early, raced two
wide around the turn, loomed a threat along the rail after five furlongs but hung. OWIN was slow from the gate, raced even with the winner early, circled into
the stretch and couldn't stay with that one. GOLDMINE KAZ came out four wide on the turn while moving, was wide into the stretch and flattened out.
MOUNTAIN ON FIRE chased early, came out three wide on the turn then tired. KONKIE raced two wide with the pace into the turn then stopped in the lane.
RAPID BEAT was hard used early to press inside and had nothing left for the drive. Post time was delayed about 8 minutes after WEST FORK got hung up
in the gate. The field was reloaded.
