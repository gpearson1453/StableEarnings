MAKE US SMILE ducked out leaving the gate and settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced
four wide on the far turn and dug in from the top of the stretch to get up the final strides. NOT TELLING stalked two deep then challenged approaching the
three eighths pole, dueled close three wide on the far turn, dug in to take a slim brief late lead, but was nipped in the final strides. BOURBON BRYCE rated
a slim lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole and dueled clear of Not Telling into the far turn, contested the advantage to late
stretch but succumbed in the final yards. STEPHANOPOULOS settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far
turn, but flattened down the lane. ALLOVERBUTTHECRYIN was shut off leaving the gate and rounded the opening turn about the four path, raced outside
into the backstretch and showed little response. FOR ARTS SAKE raced well off the pace and never factored. WINSTON raced in the five path the first turn,
showed no response through the backstretch and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
RIP RAP RILEY took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths,
widened at the rail on the far turn, then steadily handled to increase his margin. ABLE BAKER CHARLIE rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase
from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, but proved no further threat. CAVALLOTTO settled off the pace in the three path the
opening turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn, then flattened through the lane. FRENCH'S QUEST rounded the
opening turn in the four path and raced well off the pace into the backstretch, bid at the rail nearing the quarter pole, angled to the five path through the far
turn and passed rivals widest. SET'EM UP JOE saved ground off the pace, gave chase into the backstretch but faded at the rail on the far turn.
RELENTLESS STRIKE raced off the early pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole then weakened off the rail on
the far turn. TOTAL FUTBOL broke in the air and saved ground on the first turn, moved to the outside into the backstretch and never factored. COMPOUND
INTEREST stalked from the two and three paths on the opening turn but gave way from the seven sixteenths pole.

BANNER MAN raced with the pace through the backstretch and dueled at even terms three wide on the turn, dug in from the eighth pole and inched ahead
through late yards. BIGAIRTOTHETHROWN gave chase and raced in the three and four paths of the turn, dug in from the top of the stretch to take second
the final strides and was gaining slowly on the winner. BECOMING SMITTY was hustled along with the pace two deep while between horses, dug in under
steady stretch encouragement but was caught in late yards and flattened nearing the wire. IN THE GOSPEL gave chase outside, raced in the six path of the
turn and ran evenly through the lane. CLASSY SMITTY chased through the backstretch and raced near the rail most of the turn, angled to the four path
approaching the top of the lane and finished evenly. MOJO'S LOUIE CAT was hustled along inside and dueled at even terms from the seven sixteenths pole
to the quarter pole, but dropped back past the pole and weakened leaving the turn. CRISTIANO BOY broke out to make contact with MIDNIGHT HORIZON
then saved ground, while the latter, broke awkwardly and was bumped a short stride later, then never factored.

Footnotes
LADY MACHO raced in the four path the first turn and settled just off the pace leaving the second turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole, dueled to
even terms midway on the far turn, raced drew clear mid-stretch and widened later yards. COMPLETE SURPRISE rated a slim lead toward the inside, came
under pressure toward the three eighths pole and was met at even terms nearest the rail midway on the far turn, gave up the lead approaching the top of the
lane, dropped back mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. ORTINOLA settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced off the
rail on the far turn, then flattened stride. C'EST MARDI saved ground off the early pace then eased out into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the
three eighths pole to improve in the five path of the far turn, but showed little further. NAVY SWORD raced in the three path the first turn then saved ground
through the second turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, but weakened on the far turn. AZZURRA stalked the earlier pace in the three and four
paths, challenged toward the three eighths pole and gave chase from that point, but faded approaching the five sixteenths. SAMMIE SUNSHINE rounded
the opening turn in the five path and settled off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened off the rail on the far turn.

COOL ENOUGH exchanged contact with City Bird Flying leaving the gate then tapered to the inside and took the lead toward the three quarter pole to rate
the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole and was steadily handled through the stretch to hold on. EIGHT OAKS raced off the pace and off
the rail the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close through the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement from the head of the
lane and was gaining late. SO RED THE ROSE rated just off the early pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole but faded in the
three path of the far turn. ECLIPTICALS VISKI angled to the inside to take a short brief early lead then settled off the pace from the three quarter pole, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths, but faded near the rail on the far turn. WHOA BLACK BETTY saved early ground and improved her position from the
half mile pole, but, faded in the four path of the far turn. LINE OF ROSES saved early ground, showed little response through the backstretch and rounded
the far turn about the six path. WAKES UP HAPPY rounded the opening turn about the four path, raced toward the outside into the backstretch and showed
little response. CITY BIRD FLYING exchanged contact with Cool Enough leaving the gate, raced in the five path the first turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BE BE BOP chased the runner-up and took the nod from that one two deep nearing the top of the stretch, then dug in under determined handling to inch
ahead. BLACK CANDY was hustled along to set a pressured pace, kept the advantage nearest the rail on the turn, gave up the nod toward the top of the
lane and dug in gamely to late stretch before relenting. SWISS SUNRISE gave chase, raced four wide on the turn and finished evenly. ZEP gave chase and
finished evenly. SHOWTIME CAT chased, came through the turn about the three path and finished evenly. RUSTY THE UPS MAN chased inside through
the backstretch, but steadied nearest the rail approaching the quarter pole and was angled to the seven path on the turn. OFFICER UNBRIDLED broke
awkwardly, gave chase toward the outside, raced in the five path of the turn then weakened.

Footnotes
NORTHERN RIDGE settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead three wide approaching the
head of the lane, dueled clear into the stretch and was steadily encouraged to widen. BRAVE NATIVE stalked the early pace in the three path, bid leaving
the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn, then dug in under steady insistence to take second the final yards. MINI BOLT saved
ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took a slim brief lead at the rail approaching the quarter pole, dueled at the rail through the far
turn but was caught midway through the turn, dropped back into the lane and flattened later yards. CASTLE ONE came through the opening turn about the
four path and was well off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole but steadied at the inside flank of Master Yoo past the quarter
pole, raced off the rail on the turn then improved his position through stretch traffic. DEPUTY BEE saved ground off the pace the first turn then eased
outward into the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and finished evenly. WINTER IS HERE rated a
clear lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and was caught approaching the quarter, fought back at even terms two deep through
the far turn, then weakened leaving the turn. SHORT CAKE'S MAN raced well off the early pace inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole
but his rider lost his irons past the quarter and lost all chance. I'MOVERTHEMOON settled off the pace inside the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole and raced close through the backstretch, but dropped back approaching the quarter pole and faded at the rail on the turn. MASTER
YOO rounded the first turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, angled inward
approaching the quarter pole, raced three wide through the far turn then weakened.
