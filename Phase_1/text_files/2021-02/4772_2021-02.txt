HELL IN A SHELL stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced three deep leaving the turn, secured command in upper stretch, edged clear in mid
stretch and was kept to a drive late. STEELY BAND lacked speed behind horses on the turn, swung to the four path approaching the stretch and rallied
outside foes. CAPRICHOSA stalked the pace, raced between horses in the stretch and failed to rally in an even effort. AWESOME BUTTERFLY showed
brief speed along the inner rail, angled out in mid stretch and passed a tired rival. TRIKKI NIKKI sprinted clear entering the turn, saved ground and gave
way. BRIEF REACTION trailed.

Footnotes
DESPITE ODDS advanced inside leaving the chute to gain a short lead, set a pressured pace towards the rail and under some rating, went clear under
coaxing approaching the stretch, opened up under a drive past the three sixteenths, wandered outward through the final seventy yards but was clearly best
while kept to task. ORBONTHEBAYOU , between rivals early, chased three wide into the lane, churned on and got the place. BRIGHTWOOD , away alertly,
dropped back soon after and lost ground five wide, continued well wide under asking into the lane but failed to generate a legitimate kick. SPANISH CZAR
pressed the pace outside the winner, gave willing chase from the five sixteenths to mid stretch then faded. HONOR MY WORLD pursued three wide and
dropped back before going six furlongs.

outside the winner throughout, chased that one in a willing effort. GLORY DIA hopped at the break, hugged the inner rail throughout and flattened out.

SHANGHAI SUPERFLY rated kindly off of a three pronged early battle, edged up three wide leaving the far turn and took aim outside the leader, responded
to stout pressure inside the three sixteenths, kept on doggedly, forged ahead in deep stretch and went clear at the wire. STILL HAVING FUN vied three
deep early on, edged clear around the far turn and dropped in to the two path, controlled the issue around the turn and into the lane, remained clear nearing
the eighth pole, dug in when confronted soon after and ceded grudgingly through the final thirty yards. TORCH OF TRUTH angled in and settled in the
opening furlong, continued unhurried past the five sixteenths, shifted four wide in upper stretch, came under a ride near the three sixteenths and finished
with good energy. SHANE'S JEWEL , bumped at break, disputed the issue and held a short lead between foes past the five eighths marker, rated back off
STILL HAVING FUN into the turn, pursued two wide into the stretch but came up empty. TAP THE MARK , bumped and in tight at the break, saved ground
off the pace, angled out leaving the three eighths but lacked a solid kick. AUTOMATE flashed speed vying inside rivals, rated back into the turn, was under
coaxing into the lane and weakened. W W SPRINGTIME saved ground, angled five wide chasing into the lane and faded. CERULEAN SPRINGS rated
back off of rivals leaving the gate, lagged outside a rival leaving the half mile pole, had no response heading towards the lane then faltered through the final
furlong.

Footnotes
PRINCESS GEORGIA lacked speed, circled the turn four deep, closed outside horses, took the lead inside the sixteenth pole and drove clear. LONG
POINT BEACH prompted the pace outside LE PETITE PAPILLON, overtook that one in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. UTTERLY ENCHANTING
, up close around the turn, eased out entering the stretch, had aim on the lead in mid stretch then weakened. LE PETITE PAPILLON set the pace near the
inner rail and tired the final furlong. SOLEA bobbled at the break, hugged the inner rail mid way on the turn, swung to the four path turning for home and
came up empty. ARBUTUS , two wide on the turn, retreated. CAIRO QUEEN , three wide on the turn, faltered.

Footnotes
JUNGLE WARRIOR , under a snug hold outside a rival and stalking the dueling leaders, took closer order into the lane, angled out to about the four path,
was given a few taps past the three sixteenths, forged to command near the sixteenth marker and widened under steady hand encouragement. COMPANY
CLOWN got engaged in a pace battle to the outside of TAPPAHANNOCK soon after the start, took that fight to mid stretch, could not resist the winner
heading to the sixteenth pole but stayed on well to hold down the place. PASCAL CHANT flashed speed then was rated back off the embattled leaders,
stalked to the inside of the winner mid turn, eased out, raced between foes near the sixteenth pole and continued with some interest. GATOR FIFTY TWO
drafted back while saving ground, swung four wide when gathering steam into the stretch, straightened and closed steadily. TAPPAHANNOCK had speed to
the inside of COMPANY CLOWN, carried the pace scrum to mid stretch then weakened in the final seventy yards. OUTSIDE THE BOX lagged off the pace,
saved ground into the lane, angled out near mid stretch but lacked a bid. MEO DESPERADO , bumped at the break, was rated back from between rivals
soon after, raced well back mid turn and failed to menace. REDACTED REPORT came out at the break and bumped with a rival, chased off the rail then
dropped back mid turn.

ONE LAST TRIAL showed speed in the two path between horses down the backstretch, angled in on the turn, hugged the inner rail, bid for the lead turning
for home, dueled inside UNION SONG through the stretch and determinedly prevailed. UNION SONG showed speed between horses down the backstretch
and around the turn, was three wide entering the stretch then battled outside the winner in a game effort. LADY FOX lacked speed, swung to the six path in
upper stretch and rallied outside foes. WITTY BANTER lacked speed, swung to the five path in upper stretch and flattened out. FAIRY WISH , checked
lacking room along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, angled out for the stretch run and finished wilingly. RAPIDASHQUEEN showed speed between
horses, disputed the pace around the turn, raced in the two path turning for home then weakened. M. J.'S LADY showed speed along the inner rail down the
backstretch, was rated back approaching the turn then failed to be a factor. ELIZABETH T , five deep down the backstretch, circled the turn four wide and
gave way.

Footnotes
SIMMARD SHENANIGAN broke a step slow, quickly pulled her way forward towards the inside leaving the chute then had to rate back off the leaders,
angled out leaving the half mile marker, circled four wide under a hustling ride into the stretch, made a grinding run under asking and got up in the final
yards. SUPER DONNA G , with the pace between rivals early, sparred to the inside of IN CLASS around the turn, spurted away when put to firm
encouragement in upper stretch, kept on gamely past the sixteenth marker but could not quite hold off the winner. HOSS KITTEN , under a firm hold
between rivals nearing the three quarter pole, was rated back and stalked past the five eighths, gave pursuit off the rail into the lane and kept on with some
interest. POSTINO'S SECRET , off the pace, raced three wide under urging into the lane, altered out nearing mid stretch and continued with effort. IN
CLASS was steadied back from between foes soon after the start, angled four to five wide and pulled her way forward outside rivals, held a short lead into
the turn, dueled outside SUPER DONNA G from the half mile marker to the five sixteenths then weakened past the quarter pole. VICTORY TIME went clear
soon after the break, dropped down to about the two path then was taken in hand, contested the issue inside rivals past the three quarter pole, remained a
forward presence to mid turn then gave way.

MADAM MEENA bore in leaving the starting gate, prompted the pace outside CAUSE I'M EDGY, secured command in upper stretch then drew out under
brisk urging. VICTIM OF LOVE , pinched back leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, eased out to the three path in upper stretch and rallied. S
W BRIAR ROSE lacked speed, raced inside horses on the turn, angled to the three path entering the stretch and had a slight rally. CAUSE I'M EDGY
sprinted to the early lead, set a pressured pace along the inner rail and weakened through the stretch. COCONUT CAKE raced in the two path entering the
turn, floated out into the stretch and was outrun. BUNTING , three deep on the turn, floated to the five path leaving the turn, faltered and was eased late.

Footnotes
GET LIT settled off the early pace while saving some ground, steadied off heels around the far turn, angled out and circled six wide into the stretch, closed
in under right handed rousing, rolled past the dueling leaders inside the furlong grounds, kicked clear and was steadily hand ridden the final fifty yards.
LEAVE 'EM LOADED drifted in at the break and bumped with a rival, corrected and disputed the pace towards the inside and under asking, held a short
lead under a hearty drive near mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. KEEPYOURGUARDUP stalked the leaders three wide, bid three deep leaving the far
turn, battled outside LEAVE 'EM LOADED from mid turn to mid stretch then gave way stubbornly. WHITE NITRO , off slowly, settled off the pace, cut the
corner into the lane and finished with interest. FLASH LIGHTENING , four wide, made a decent run mid turn while under urging, had the leaders in his sights
into the lane, stayed on his left lead and came up empty. NO IMAGINATION popped the gate pre race, raced between runners early, angled four wide into
the lane but lacked a bid. MOONZANO had speed to dispute the pace outside LEAVE 'EM LOADED, fought on between runners past the three eighths,
failed to keep up in upper stretch and tired. BALTINGLASS , unruly pre race, broke through the gate without his rider, was re entered, had some speed
while saving ground, failed to keep pace past the five sixteenths while about two wide and tired.
