Footnotes
TREASURE RUN broke to the lead, rated along through an even pace inside, and was kept to pressure to remain clear. BIG PERM was bumped between
horses after the start, settled in the middle of the field early, rallied three wide into the stretch and could not seriously menace the winner. CUY broke slowly
and was outrun for six furlongs, moved out four wide approaching the stretch and rallied mildly. BEYOND THE CALL was four wide entering the first turn,
moved in through the middle stages, and lacked a solid closing bid. CALABASH bumped with BIG PERM after the start, and was no threat inside. PARETO
OPTIMAL (FR) was no factor two to three wide. PERFECT ENOUGH checked sharply inside PARETO OPTIMAL near the quarter-pole at the back, and
remained outrun. GLOBAL VISION bumped with BIG PERM after the start, prompted the pace outside TREASURE RUN, and retreated after six furlongs.
MAKE A MOVE showed early speed, and faded before reaching the stretch. METEORITO was never prominent.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT WHISKEY set a fast pace inside under a rating hold, kicked clear nearing the lane, drifted out under left-handed urging in the final furlong and
just lasted. MR TITO'S stumbled at the start, raced off the pace three and four wide, closed strongly through the final furlong and just missed. PROSPECT
PROJECT was in range three wide, dropped back while still on the left lead in upper stretch, switched over leaving the eighth pole and re-rallied between
foes. NIMBLE BEAST pressed the winner two wide and weakened in the final furlong. EXCALIBUR saved ground to no avail. ULTRACONFIDENT had early
speed two wide and faded. RIGGINS lagged well back inside, swung five wide near the quarter pole, raced in the ten path through the lane and never
threatened. HARPER GO LUCKY was outrun while racing two wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED; SEVEN-FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

GENERIC JOE (IRE) advanced around the turn four then three wide, wrested command outside THE KING AQUILES and DREAMING THOUSAND past
the eighth-pole and drove clear. DREAMING THOUSAND pressed the pace outside, reached the front outside THE KING AQUILES through the furlong
grounds, and was outkicked. THE KING AQUILES set the pace inside, yielded into the last eighth of a mile, and saved the show. CON PERMISO was
outrun early inside, came three wide off the turn and gained mildly for a share. UNIMPEACHED saved ground behind the leaders to the stretch, and had no
final response. OUTDOOR DINING broke slowly, was outrun early and passed tired horses. ARTISTA swung four wide leaving the turn, and made no
headway. WATER CAY was outrun throughout. PRINCE TRITON hopped at the break and was slowest to begin, and never got close. FORTY FLASH
pressed the pace between horses, and was finished after three-eighths of a mile.

Footnotes
CHIPSHAPE settled off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole, moved to the front near the three-sixteenths marker, continued on the left
lead through the lane and widened under intermittent urging. KOLOHE PRINCE steadied just after the start, rushed up four wide to press the pace, took the
lead near the quarter pole, was collared by the winner in upper stretch, proved no match for that foe but held clear of the rest. UNION GAP pressed the
pace between foes in the three path, could not match strides nearing the lane but churned on to regained the show. SOCIAL EQUALITY saved ground off
the pace, angled four wide near the quarter pole and went evenly. GLOBALTROUBLECOCO failed to menace while racing two wide. LONGTAIL set a
pressured pace in the two path and tired in upper stretch. PULL A FREDDIE was outrun while racing three wide. TRINNI LIGHT played no factor while
racing two wide.

Footnotes
DONNELS CREEK saved ground taking closer order approaching the stretch, rallied through a seam between horses a furlong out, forged past ZAINO
BOYZ from outside and edged clear. CAPTAIN RON bumped with ZAINO BOYZ at the break and stumbled sharply, was outrun inside early, lacked room
turning for home and through the furlong grounds, gained clearance late between horses and finished well. FIELDER pursued the pacesetter two then three
wide to the stretch, and was outfinished. STREET COPPER was outsprinted three wide early, and gained mildly on the far outside through the closing
stages. THREE OUTLAWS chased inside early, moved to the two-path midway on the turn, stayed in range to the eighth-pole and faded. FACE OF
VICTORY raced in the second flight between horses, and failed to threaten. ZAINO BOYZ bumped with CAPTAIN RON at the start, dashed clear early and
moved inside, and gave way past the furlong marker. CRYOGENIC broke behind the field, and trailed inside.

EAGERLY saved ground trailing early, edged closer two wide around the far turn, angled out nearing the eighth pole, closed outside and was up on the
wire. BLUE LOU BOYLE (IRE) set the pace along the rail, was headed nearing the five-sixteenths, regained command in upper stretch, had the rider drop
the whip in deep stretch, and led until the final stride. BRAZILLIONAIRE settled off the early pace three wide, bid three deep around the far turn, briefly led
near the five-sixteenths pole, battled on past the eighth pole but was outfinished. MAURO'S TEAM stalked the pace from the rail, bid inside of foes in
midstretch but faded a bit late while lacking room at the rail. MIGHTY TOUGH went evenly while racing two and three wide. FINDING MISCHIEF pressed
the pace two wide, dropped back sharply under a hold nearing the lane and was easing through the stretch.

Footnotes
CHOOSE JOY hit the starting gate, tracked the pace from the rail, got through turning for home, bid inside of the pacesetters while still on the left lead
nearing the eighth pole, switched leads leaving that pole, kicked clear soon after, held clear to deep stretch and just withstood the runner-up's late surge.
STILL ALIVE lagged off the pace three wide, angled widest into the lane, surged through the final eighth and just missed. DIXIEINCANDYLAND stalked the
pace three wide, had a mild bid nearing the eighth pole and was outfinished. SPUN GLASS hit the starting gate, raced off the pace two wide, angled five
wide into the lane and had a mild gain between. COMPENSATE set the pace along the rail, drifted slightly into the two path turning for home, was collared
near the eighth pole and weakened through the final furlong. TRACY ANN'S LEGACY was unprepared for the start, hopped while belatedly leaving the gate,
raced four wide and lacked a rally. BOERNE pressed thee pace two wide and tired in the drive.

SOLDOLLIE set the pace inside, shook off pursuers after a half-mile, dug in along the rail on his left lead through the stretch, and held gamely for the
decision. GAME BOY BENNY moved off the inside to the three-path approaching the top of the stretch, rallied outside the winner and was inching closer
through the final yards. PRO QUALITY bumped with VINNIE VAN GO at the start, advanced around the turn five then four wide, had aim outside the leaders
in upper stretch but did not have enough. FRONT LOADED shifted four wide approaching the stretch, and could not gain late. ROYAL SQUEEZE saved
ground outrun into the turn, and could not reach contention. APACHE was no factor two to three wide. RESIDENT pressed the early pace between horses,
and weakened around the turn. RAY'SWARRIOR pressed the pace three wide early, and tired after a half-mile. VINNIE VAN GO bumped with PRO

Footnotes
LITTLE BIT GOOD settled off the pace while racing two wide, tipped three wide in upper stretch, closed outside through the lane, reached the front near the
sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. LEA RO stalked the pace two wide, took the lead leaving the eighth pole, was collared by the winner near
the sixteenth marker, battled on inside that foe but was second best late. LOVELY BROWN broke outwardly, raced well back two wide, angled out in upper
stretch and rallied for the show. POSITIVE SKEW saved ground off the pace, waited for room nearing the lane, angled out in upper stretch, rallied through
the lane but was narrowly outkicked inside of LOVELY BROWN to just miss third. KOURVOISIER (IRE) set the pace along the rail to midstretch and tired.
CAT'S J N J played no factor while racing two wide. QUEEN FIELD failed to menace while racing three and four wide. ALL ABOUT KATHERN stumbled at
the start, raced along the rail in midpack, lacked a bid and was eased in the lane. TALKTHETALK was in range three wide and retreated nearing the lane.
