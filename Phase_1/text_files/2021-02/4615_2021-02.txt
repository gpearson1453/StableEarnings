Footnotes
FRENCHIE FROU FROU outrun in the early going inside, moved out, advanced from between foes mid turn, four wide into the lane, drew off through the
stretch under her own courage. SLEWACHIT dueled up front while off the inside, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, proved no match for the winner
to the wire, held sway for the place. B REWARDING void of speed, saved ground through the turn, finished up best of the rest. SOUPER CAPACITY in the
second flight toward the inside, moved out a bit late in the turn, lacked a closing response in the drive. WICKED CHOCOLATE bothered at the start, raced
three wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. DEDE'S TRICK back off the pace, four wide through most of the turn, also came up empty for the drive.
SHE'S AN ANGEL broke out, bothered foe, dueled, gave way.

Footnotes
SCARLET POSITION within striking distance early, one paced through the turn, lacked a late punch, narrowly lasted for the show. FINAL FORM off a step
slow, raced back while saving ground and was never a threat. JUST FLY settled off the pace and the inside, angled out to be three wide turning for home,
no threat to the winner, edged clear for the second spot. RAINTREE STARLET broke on top, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to show the way
through the turn by daylight, drew off under intermittent left handed pressure past the furlong marker then geared down late to win ridden out. MADISON
WAY went one paced throughout, no rally. J P'S GLADYS off slowly, trailed for over a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. TEXAS
MUSIC chased the winner for four furlongs off the inside, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MELTING SNOW away in good order, chased the early leader off the inside, advanced and engaged that one turning for home, gained the advantage, long
drive, held the runner up safe late while fully extended. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME in the second flight off the inside, asked along and angled three wide turning
for home, slowly getting to the winner late to that one's outside. BENSON lacked speed off the inside, staged a mild rally three wide, gained the nod for the
show. CLEAR STEPS broke alertly, clear early in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, briefly responded when the winner came alongside exiting
the bend, weakened when headed by that rival soon after. SHE'S MY RIDE off a step slow, raced far back, saved ground through the turn, improved slightly
while not a serious threat. BOSSY MOMENT raced outside, four wide into the stretch, lacked a closing kick. AVABELL forwardly placed along the inside,
steadily retreated.

Footnotes
BODE'S LIGHT never far back outside, came four wide when advancing late in the turn, long duel outside, proved narrowly best in a determined effort.
MEGATAP vied up front while just off the inside, between rivals through the turn when showing the way, dueled to the wire inside the winner, proved
stubborn to the end. STREET TOLL back off the pace and the inside, two path through the turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive while remaining
toward the inside. HANKS forced in at the start, trailed inside, picked off a couple of tiring rivals. BIKER TIM with the pace while racing outside, tired after a
half. NO CLASSIVA veered in at the start, moved up press the issue into the turn, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
KRISTO lacked speed toward the inside, encountered some traffic midway on the second turn when beginning to advance, steered out three wide for room
into the stretch, set down, finished with good energy to win going away midtrack. STRATE REMARK took command from the start inside, rated in the run up
the backstretch, continued to show the way by daylight into the stretch, proved no match for the winner late, narrowly lasted for the place. ALWAYS A
CATCH settled in the second flight inside, continued to save some ground second turn, mild late interest to narrowly miss the place. WITCH DOCTOR last
to leave, trailed for over a half, came four wide out of the final turn, staged a mild, belated rally to improve position. ROAR OF THE LION void of speed while
racing toward the inside, steered out a bit turning for home, improved position with some late interest. SINGANDCRYINDUBAI broke on top, chased the
leader for seven furlongs, had little left late to lose several positions. CHICORY BLUE lacked speed off the inside, moved slightly closer into the far turn,
roused soon after, failed to muster a response. ALL SHACKED UP raced in the second flight in the two path, asked along into the far turn, failed to respond,
backed up in the drive. GIANT INFLUENCE balked at loading, broke in, raced in mid pack for six furlongs, gave way second turn.

Footnotes
STARRGARITA off slow, moved up in the run into the turn, four wide through the bend while continuing to advance, closest to the winner a furlong out,
dropped inside of that one when that same foe drifted out, just up in the final strides. ALLOFOURDREAMS cleared to the inside steadily after the start,
showed the way through the turn and into the stretch, drifted out under a left handed stick late, nipped at the wire. COUVERTURE within striking distance
inside, continued to save ground through the bend and into the lane, could do little with the top pair to the wire, remained clear of the others. RICHNESS
broke with the field inside, tapped on the breaks in the second flight to be shuffled back a bit into the turn, was righted, modest late interest to improved
somewhat in the drive. SPILLED PERFUME lacked speed, angled out behind horses to be four wide turning for home, also improved a bit in the drive.
AMELIA'S BONNET broke back, lacked speed, modest late improvement while remaining toward the inside. WISH FOR CANDY in the second flight and
within striking distance outside, slightly closer three wide turning for home, came up empty for the drive. CYBER AFFAIR raced in mid pack, four wide late in
the turn, failed to muster a rally. TYNE AFTER TYNE off a bit slow off the inside, three wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally when called on for the
drive. LORI'S EYES chased the leader up the backstretch, was tiring when in a bit tight late in the bend, continued to give way through the stretch. CADDO
QUEEN fell back to trail after the start, showed little.

Footnotes
COULD YOU forwardly placed outside, pressed three wide through the turn, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, drew clear under steady handling.
BRECHIN'S COMMAND in the main body off the inside, waited briefly and steadied slightly behind a wall of horses turning for home, clear for the drive,
angled in, finished evenly to be up for the place. SHOWIT last away, raced back and outside, came seven wide into the stretch, also showed some late
energy to be up for the show while well out in the strip. HUSH Y'ALL void of speed, five wide and in some traffic turning for home, stride late thru traffic.
TRIPLE SCOUT moved up steadily the opening quarter to vie for the lead, narrowly showed the way through the turn, weakened when headed by the
winner turning into the stretch, continued to falter the final furlong. FLEETA BELLE in some traffic into the turn, continued to be surrounded through the
bend, four wide into the stretch, went evenly late when clear for the drive. MIA PROMESSA void of speed off the inside, four wide late turn, passed tiring
rivals. ENTRUSTED broke out, in mid pack when shuffled back in traffic entering the turn, advanced into the lane well off the inside, flattened out in the run
to the wire. NAUTICAL GEM vied up front for a half while between rivals and gave way. SWEET TATUM forwardly placed outside, four out to five wide
turning for home, tired in the drive. SHESHED stumbled at the start, raced in the main body early, was finished early.

Footnotes
PALIO FLAG settled off the pace inside, closer up the rail into the far turn, moved out, three wide bid turning for home, lengthy drive, fully extended late to
prove best while remaining widest of the first flight at the wire. W W FITZY vied up front into the first turn, clear with some encouragement midway on the
first turn, clear in the run up the backstretch, responded when confronted in the second turn, closest to the inside, proved stubborn to hold the place late.
SARA SEA vied into the first turn into the first turn, squeezed a bit then steadied to fall back off the runner up soon after, moved out and chased that rival up
the backstretch, challenged in the two path final turn, long drive between the top two to the wire, outkicked late. FIRE CORAL well off the pace while close to
the inside, asked along while continuing to save some ground second turn, shifted out late but could manage little in the way of a gain on the top three.
VILLANELLE last away, trialed most of the way in failing to threaten. O SERAPHINA steadily faded while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
TWILIGHT BLUE forwardly placed inside under firm restraint, patient handling second turn, split foes turning for home, bumped a furlong out, showed good
determination to persevere late in game fashion. RIPTIDE ROCK pressed the issue off the inside, challenged and took over inside the furlong marker, came
up, bumped the winner soon after, outkicked while once again between horses at the wire. WOODHOUSE slow to settle off the inside through the first turn,
mid pack up the backstretch, asked along in some traffic second turn, three wide into the lane, outside bid final furlong, not enough late. LEBLON steadied
in tight quarters nearing the wire the first time, devoid of speed, continued back the middle half, angled three wide turning for home, improved position to be
getting to the top three late. SCARRED within striking distance while racing three wide, lacked a closing response. COUSIN LARRY off a step slow, raced
back, passed tiring rivals while not a threat. GAGOOTS void of speed, remained back while racing wide. ONCOMING TRAIN broke on top, set the pace
inside, gave way when headed out of the final turn. INSPECTOR FROST rank early, got out in the first turn, was finished after a half.
