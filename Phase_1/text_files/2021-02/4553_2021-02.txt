stretch, kicked clear under a right-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths, drew off under a drive into the final forty yards then was eased up while much
the best. LINDA GOT LUCKY was sent hard from the start, bumped with a rival early, steadied briefly when HERE COMES LINDA made it tight on her
midway down the backstretch, was urged along while angling from the two path to the four path on the turn, chased under the whip into the final furlong and
proved no match for the winner but held the place. HERE COMES LINDA was restless in the gate, bumped with a rival early, disputed the pace on the
inside of a foe, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the
show. BRIGHTNMORNINGSTAR broke in at the start, took several awkward strides while crowded against the rail coming to the five-eighths then dropped
back, saved ground on the turn, angled six wide into upper stretch, raced in the center of the track under strong urging in the final furlong and failed to
threaten. MY HEART DOMINUS settled towards the rear of the field, went three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to
respond. TWO MORE BARBO was hustled from the start then ridden along off the pace, dropped from three to two wide on the turn and came up empty.
SURPRISE GIRL was unsettled in the gate, broke out then bumped with a foe and was off a step slow, dropped well behind the rest of the field, went two to
three wide on the turn and was no factor. SOFT N LOVELY was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and faltered.

RELUCTANT WARRIOR went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the far turn, took the lead into
upper stretch, responded well to the challenge of the runner-up in the final furlong and held gamely under strong urging. BRITTS A CLOSER went four wide
on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside, went three then four wide on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, rallied to make a bid at the
eighth-pole, battled outside of the winner in the final furlong and was denied while well clear for the place. OH MY ACHING ARCH was hustled from the
start, saved ground on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, moved off the rail while asked around the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive into
the final furlong and weakened then just held the show. LOVE THAT WARRIOR raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was unhurried at the rear,
went around the far turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch, angled further out into the final furlong and finished with late energy to just miss
the show. SPECIAL BINGO brushed with a foe just after the start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path
on the far turn, moved out outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. LES PAUL brushed with a rival just after the start then was taken up
when SPECIAL BINGO dropped in front early, moved out shortly thereafter then went three wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace, saved ground
under urging on the far turn and failed to threaten. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU broke very fast and went straight to the lead, set the pace while inside to the
two path, was asked at the quarter-pole then lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and tired. A LITTLE RISKY was taken under a vigorous hold
early then reserved at the back on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch and was no factor. (Rail at 26 Feet)

WHO TOOK THE MONEY was off slow then bumped hard with a rival, settled off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, drafted three wide on the
turn, moved out while roused in upper stretch, rallied to the lead inside the furlong marker, drifted in while drawing away near the sixteenth-pole and proved
much the best under steady urging. CHAD'S AUTUMN KING quickly sped clear then was taken in hand, vied in the two path under threat on the turn,
responded well when set down in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong then was overtaken by the winner and proved no match but held the
place. RARE STRAIN veered out at the start, moved up to stalk the pace, made a bid in the four path on the turn, dropped back under a drive into the final
furlong and lost the place while clear for the show. CANDY SHOPPER settled off the pace, drafted inside to the two path on the turn, was roused at the
five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. THUNK moved up after the start, made a bid in the three path under urging on the turn, dropped back in
upper stretch and weakened. ANTIETAM ROAD bumped hard with a rival after the start, settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn and
capitulated. WIN WON DOBBS was forced out at the start then dropped in, settled at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, was put to a drive in
upper stretch and failed to respond.
