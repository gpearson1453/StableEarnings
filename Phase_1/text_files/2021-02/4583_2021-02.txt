Footnotes
VERY SAVVY chased from midpack in the four path, pursued PRETZEL turning for home as that foe took control, ranged up alongside that rival at the
furlong marker, and quickly drew clear. PRETZEL bumped the gate at the start, chased the clear leader from the three path while forwardly placed around
the turn, bid for the lead turning for home, forged an advantage, but was headed by the eventual winner passing the furlong grounds, and proved second
best. JULIE BIRD (IRE) shook her head right before the gates opened causing her to be unprepared for the start and away slowly, trailed along the inside
into the turn, commenced a rally in upper stretch, split foes two wide at the furlong marker, and stayed on to claim a minor share. ALEXANDRA AM I vied
along the inside early on, but failed to keep pace with an outer foe into the turn, chased that rival around the bend, then kept on while holding show through
midstretch, but was outfinished for that position in the late stages. BEAUTY BOSS lied forwardly placed along the inside early on, retreated to midpack into
the turn, shifted three wide in upper stretch, and lacked a rally. SPEEDING TICKET was off slowly, lied off of the pace along the inside while in the two path
around the turn, then shifted four wide turning for home while fading. KARENVILLE never got involved. LA DAME broke outwardly to open space, vied two
wide early on, cleared her inner counterpart into the turn, stayed in the two path around the bend, but was quickly headed by PRETZEL turning for home,
and weakened in upper stretch. PLATA was off slowly, took the turn four to five wide while well off of the pace, and failed to make an impact.

JUST LIKE MIKE pressed the early pace three wide, took over outside PRINCE IGOR and began to widen approaching the quarter-pole, continued to
expand the margin under pressure past the furlong marker, and was in hand the last sixteenth of a mile. ORAN raced three wide around the turn, and rallied
to best the remainder. PRINCE IGOR veered out sharply at the start, regrouped and vied outside TARQUIN early, was no match for the winner after five
furlongs, and faded to wind up a distant third. SKYLINE VIEW was no factor four wide. REINOANIMAUX was always outrun. JUPITER BLUES was finished
after a half-mile. TARQUIN vied inside for a half and stopped. GRAN PATRON was pulled up after a half, and walked off.

Footnotes
GYPSY WIFE dueled two wide, drew clear approaching the five sixteenths marker, widened under vigorous hand urging through upper stretch, and was
wrapped up passing the alternate finish line. STORMY DERBY DAY stalked three wide, trailed the short field into the turn, but progressed around it to bid
for place outside of JIMMYSSMOKEDCARROT at the five sixteenths pole, battled with that foe for that position through upper stretch, and prevailed with a
sixteenth to go. JIMMYSSMOKEDCARROT broke inwards, dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but failed to keep pace with that foe
approaching the five sixteenths marker, dug in for place inside of STORMY DERBY DAY turning for home, but was bested by that foe at the sixteenth pole.
SMIRKOTCH got mildly forced inwards at the start by an outer rival, lied off of the pace along the inside, and was outrun. DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED. THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION IS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
YELLOWSTONE GIRL bumped with TEN PIN ALLY, then pushed that one inward for a few strides, ducked in to the gap slightly while on the lead leaving
the chute, rated along slightly off the rail for six furlongs, entered the lane in the two-path, and stayed clear while drifting out late. ELLIEREESEASTON
steadied briefly inside YELLOWSTONE GIRL entering the main track, moved out three wide on the turn, went back in cutting the corner to the stretch, and
rallied along the rail for the place. TEN PIN ALLY bumped with YELLOWSTONE GIRL at the break, then got pushed in by that rival, lodged a mild bid three
then four wide on the turn, and ran on to narrowly miss the runner-up spot. MISS ITALY swung five wide approaching the stretch to loom a threat, stayed on
her left lead through the stretch and drifted out while shortening stride. KENTUCKY PRIDE failed to menace two wide. HEART OF GOD pressed the pace,
bid between horses coming to the five-sixteenths, but could not sustain the rally.

Footnotes
ILL WILL broke inwards and was off poorly, saved ground far off off the pace around the turn, and produced a rail rally through the lane to drive past the
leaders at the sixteenth pole. NIGHT ORCHID tracked from midpack along the inside, took the turn in the two path, allowed ILL WILL to slip inside of him
passing the five sixteenths pole, got outkicked by that foe turning for home, altered course five wide in midstretch, and stayed on to gain place on the wire.
MIAHSOLOMIAH dueled for the lead outside of BUXOM BEAST while kept in the three path by that foe around the turn, then was outkicked by an inner foe
inside the final furlong, got the better of his dueling counterpart shortly after, but was nailed on the wire for place. BUXOM BEAST dueled for the lead inside
of MIAHSOLOMIAH while staying just over a path off of the inner railing, dug in to sustain the duel through midstretch, but was outkicked by an inner
surging foe at the sixteenth pole, and weakened. MUDSLIDE WICKED chased the dueling leaders from the four path around the turn, attempted a mild
grind outside of those rivals through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner and an outer foe in midstretch, and flattened out. MYSTICAL CHARGE
was outrun. SASSY CAT bobbled at the start and never got involved. MAMA LONGLEGS tracked from midpack, drifted to the six path into the turn, and
steadily faded. VALLUNA trailed throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
BOSTON POST ROAD pressed the pace outside HITECH IS BACK, took over with the rider taking some peeks back after a half-mile, began to widen
through the furlong grounds and was kept to task. MISCHIEFFUL raced three wide in range to the stretch, and finished well to be clearly second best. RED
HOT AND BLUE hustled up along the inside after the start, paused momentarily lacking room past the half-mile pole, came off the inside in upper stretch
and offered a mild response to pick up the show. HITECH IS BACK set the pace inside, could not match strides with the winner turning for home, and faded.
DREAM ABOUT ME raced two to three wide, and lacked a closing bid. BYE BYE tired after a half-mile two wide. TRUST TODAY raced four to five wide,
and failed to menace. MISZLO was no factor four wide. ICED LATTE bumped with PURE FASHION at the start, and was outrun inside. H. T. XENA was
finished early. PURE FASHION (GB) bumped with ICED LATTE at the start, and showed little at the back.

Footnotes
JOUSTER rated along on a loose lead around the first turn, quickened the tempo down the backstretch, widened on her own power into the far turn,
established an insurmountable lead in upper stretch, then tired inside the final sixteenth while on her left lead, but held safely to the wire. GLADYS stalked
the loose leader two wide without applying pressure, proved no match for that foe into the far turn, but chased her well through the lane to regain ground as
that foe tired, but was only second best. KARAKATSIE tracked from midpack along the inside while under a snug hold around the first turn, failed to keep
pace with the leading pair into the far turn, but stayed clear of fourth through the lane. INTHEWINNERSCIRCLE trailed two wide around the first turn, and
improved through the lane without threatening the leader. STATE CROWN tracked from midpack three wide, but faded around the far turn.
MARLBOROUGH ROAD (IRE) bobbled slightly at the start, then rated off of the pace along the inside, but was outrun.

Footnotes
FIGHTRESS was innermost of four scrimmaging for the early lead, shook clear from NIKEE KAN turning for home and widened under confident hand
urging. NIKEE KAN was widest of the foursome for three furlongs, had aim at the winner through the lane, and settled for second best. SWEETLY MAID
was outsprinted early, swung four wide coming off the turn, and was along for the show on the far outside. DISTINCTLY BLUE pressed the pace between
horses three wide, and faded into the stretch. MISS MIAMI hesitated at the start spotting the field two to three lengths, and never reached contention. GOT
GLEE pressed the pace two wide, checked unable to hold her position near the five-sixteenths, and was allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
OBLIGATORY lied off of the pace three wide, got outmoved by a pair of foes into the turn, tipped four wide at the three furlong pole to commence her
advance, then sustained a rally through the lane to catch the leader a sixteenth out, and drove clear. FRONT STREET set the pace along the inside, inched
away to a clear advantage at the half mile pole, held that margin in hand around the turn, then was let out in upper stretch with OBLIGATORY in pursuit,
came under driving pressure at the furlong pole, but was surpassed by that foe at the sixteenth marker, and proved second best. PRECIPITATE trailed the
field four wide, advanced outside of a trio of foes into the turn to achieve a three wide stalking position passing the three furlong pole, but failed to reach the
clear leader before flattening out on her left lead in upper stretch. MYRTLE IRENE tracked from midpack two wide, improved inside of horses into the turn to
pursue the clear leader around the turn, but was outkicked by PRECIPITATE passing the five sixteenths pole, and faltered thereafter. VINTAGE STYLE
prompted the pace three wide leaving the chute, stalked the loose leader down the backstretch, but was outmoved by rivals on both sides into the turn, and
faded thereafter. UNION TATTERS prompted the pace two wide and between horses early on, stalked the loose leader down the backstretch, then got
outmoved by rivals into the turn, and faded. STARSHIP UNICA tracked from midpack along the inside, but was done early. BORN AGAIN lied forwardly
placed four wide, but took a bad step approaching the eleven sixteenths pole, pulled up quickly thereafter, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
RESERVENOTATTAINED was close up early inside, eased back off the leaders past the half-mile pole, sat chilly awaiting room midway on the turn,
maneuvered out to the four-path for clearance at the top of the stretch, challenged outside SOUTH SEA with a furlong remaining, stayed on his left lead and
prevailed late. SOUTH SEA eyed the leading trio up the backstretch, ranged up three wide with a bid on the turn, wrested command outside MILES AHEAD
at the top of the stretch, dug in when confronted by the winner and stayed on stubbornly. MILES AHEAD pressed the early pace outside, reached the front
outside CHILL HAZE just past the three-eighths, got overhauled into the lane, and ran on with good courage along the rail. CREA'S BKLYN LAW bumped
with CHILL HAZE at the break and was slow to get going, and improved for the last major share without threatening. WHAT'S TO BLAME took closer order
while strung out widest on the turn, then flattened out into the stretch. ALL AROUND gained mildly while moving out wide on the turn, but could not sustain
the rally. CHILL HAZE bumped with CREA'S BKLYN LAW at the start, contested the early pace, and faltered after a half-mile.

Footnotes
ABIDING STAR set the pace along the inside, shifted off of the fence in upper stretch, and firmly kept an inner foe at bay. GOLDEN DECISION stalked
along the inside, bid for the lead inside of the leader passing the furlong pole, but was denied. TOUGHEST 'OMBRE lied far off of the pace in the four path
around both turns, gained while shifting to the five path turning for home, and rallied to achieve show. PROJECTED (GB) stalked three wide, bid for the lead
at the quarter pole, but flattened out in midstretch. TIL THE END swung from the two path to the six path turning for home, and stayed on mildlly. DONJI
took the turns in the two path while off of the pace, and made no impact. ROCKET JOE COPPER saved ground from midpack, but to no avail. MYSTICAL
MOON took the turns in the three path while in midpack, but faded through the lane. PONT DU GARD prompted the pace two wide, but weakened between
horses at the quarter pole. DEVOTED KITTEN was outrun.
