Footnotes
CALL ME HANDSOME was urged to the lead a bit off the rail, disputed the issue outside a rival racing to the turn, steadily widened the advantage nearing
upper stretch and was kept to firm right handed pressure. MULLED WINE angled inwards tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, saved ground to
upper stretch and proved best of the others. TRULY STELLAR tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted three wide into the lane but
continued well enough to prevail for a share. THE GREAT LOUDINI, a bit outpaced dropping out last to the turn, angled five wide in the stretch while finding
his best stride late. GETTININTOMISCHIEF tracked off the second flight outside foes, angled four wide entering the lane but was outkicked for a share.
OSKAR BLUES was urged along the inside prompting the pacesetter into the turn, lost ground to that foe on the bend, shifted out nearing upper stretch and
gave way.

GEORGIA PINES settled near the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn gathering momentum, split foes in upper stretch, then
shifted four wide nearing the furlong marker and continued with a steady late response to prevail under firm handling. ANALYZEYOURVISION tracked off
the first flight inside a rival in early stages, switched out nearing the far turn to advance three deep on the leaders, bid for command racing into upper stretch
to gain a brief advantage, resisted the winner's bid but yielded late. O'HAIRE tracked off the first flight outside a rival to the backstretch, steadily advanced to
press the pace racing through the far turn but weakened between foes in the drive. DRAKESBORO WILDCAT sped to the fore along the inside, dueled for
command into the far turn and gave way late. STRETCH RUNNER tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the far turn, shifted out nearing
upper stretch but quickly came up empty. ITSMYLUCKYSUMMER settled between foes but never mounted a serious challenge. STERLING ICE, urged
prompting a rival's pace in the opening half, gave way racing into the far turn. DIVINE CONTROL settled near the inside and failed to menace. CHIT CHAT
CHARMER tracked off the second flight along the inside and faded after a half. BUDDY'S PEAK'N proved no factor.

AIR FORCE PINK was rated just off the second flight while angling inside racing to the backstretch, split foes entering the far turn commencing a steady
advance, angled inside the leader in upper stretch challenging for command, then went clear in the drive under firm encouragement. PATSY'S BIG GIRL,
reserved outside foes off the second flight, steadily advanced three wide into the far turn, then to upper stretch and edged a rival for the place honors
nearing the wire. V K STAR switched out prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, forged clear entering the far turn but failed to sustain that
momentum nearing midstretch. GOLD COUNTRY tracked just off the leaders inside a rival as part of the second flight to the backstretch and came up
empty nearing the lane. CROSS THE MERSEY settled between foes in early stages, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. MY OWN
PASSION stumbled at the start, was reserved last near the inside to the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch to gain some position five wide late but made
no real impression. INDY FRONT settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. MERMAID'S TEAR hopped at the start, settled near
the inside but proved no threat. DIAMOND SLEW tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the backstretch and faded after a half. I'LL
GETTHEWHISKEY, urged to the lead along the rail leaving the chute, disputed the pace inside a rival entering the backstretch and gave way abruptly after
a half.

Footnotes
SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT tracked off the second flight near the inside in the opening stages, shifted out gathering momentum on the turn, angled four wide
nearing upper stretch, then continued in that path through the closing stages to wear down MY SISTER'S KEEPER in time under a few right handed taps.
The latter, broke in making contact with PIONEER WOMAN, was rated outside foes off the second flight in early stages, steadily advanced three wide racing
into the turn, to go clear nearing upper stretch but proved no match for the winner late. JUDY'S WAY shifted inwards tracking the pacesetter as part of the
second flight, was urged to advance three deep between foes nearing upper stretch but weakened while failing to match the top pair. MY GIRL ANNIE
tracked the pacesetter along the inside in second flight, switched off the inside racing through the turn but had no closing bid. PIONEER WOMAN, bumped
from both sides at the start, settled between foes, angled five wide entering the turn but offered no rally. SARJENALLI broke through the gate before the
start, ducked out making contact with PIONEER WOMAN at the break, was righted, then urged clear along the inside racing to the turn and gave way
nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
DON BOURBON broke readily, shifted to the inside leaving the chute while momentarily being held up off a loose rival, angled inside the leaders tracking
just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, switched outside the leader racing into the far turn, took over from that foe racing into upper stretch, went well
clear under firm handling, then was vanned off the course following the race. RECORDER, reserved between foes, then along the inside racing to the
backstretch, saved ground on the far turn steadily gaining position, angled out three wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady response to edge a
rival for the place honors. SIMMARDSTRIKE tracked the leaders along the inside from just out striking distance racing to the far turn, shifted out in upper
stretch gaining position between foes but was outkicked for second. TIME FOR TROUBLE settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch,
then split foes three wide in the closing stages to gain some position. MARKSMAN, reserved outside foes racing to the backstretch, was fanned four wide
into upper stretch but had no rally. SECLUDE settled along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch, was caught in close quarters late and had no rally.
ALLGORILLA was urged to the lead while angling inside leaving the chute, switched off the rail entering the first turn avoiding a loose rival, shifted in on the
backstretch to set the pace racing to the far turn, dueled inside the winner to upper stretch and emptied out abruptly nearing the furlong marker. RED CAT
(CHI) was rated between foes in second flight to the backstretch but steadily faded after a half. THAT'S BUCKBEAK, forwardly placed just outside the
pacesetter leaving the chute, was caught in the four path racing through the first turn when carried out a bit, continued to prompt the pace for a half and
gave way. WINTER'S WONDER stumbled at the start dislodging his rider, but walked off the course under his own power after being collected by the
outrider.

Footnotes
TEN MILES HIGH was urged along the inside prompting a rival's pace racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue entering the turn to gain a narrow
advantage, shifted out to three path in upper stretch and edged clear late under firm handling. LIL' NINJA tracked off the first flight a bit off the inside racing
to the turn, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch to bid inside the pacesetter and proved best of the others. QUICK STEP ED tracked off the first flight
racing four wide to the turn, then continued in that path in the closing stages to edge rivals for a share while no match for the top pair. LARGE, in touch with
the pacesetter from the outset prompting that rival three deep racing into the turn, pressed the issue between foes to upper stretch but weakened in the
closing stages. MOBEATYABAD bobbled at the start, was urged between foes setting the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, dueled for
command between foes to upper stretch and faded in the closing stages. SEMINOLE WARRIOR, shuffled a bit avoiding close quarters at the start, dropped
off the leaders, angled to the inside on the turn and offered no rally. ACTION WARRIOR angled to the rail in the opening stages and dropped back early.

Footnotes
BOCA GUY was prompted to a clear advantage nearest the inside leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a comfortable advantage in hand racing to the
backstretch, was roused racing through the stretch and held his rivals on safe margin to the end. CONNAGH'S QUAY angled inwards racing through the
chute to track off the leaders between rivals in second flight to the backstretch, shifted out three wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance and
continued to dispute second through the stretch while edging a rival for the place honors late. COMMON BOND, off a step slowly, recovered quickly to gain
a position along the inside rating inside foes in the second flight, saved ground through the far turn, then shifted off the inside to bid between the top pair late
but was just outkicked for second. SEARCHING FOR GOLD tracked the leaders three wide in second flight to the backstretch, dropped back from that
position racing under patient handling entering the far turn, swung out four wide in upper stretch while being roused to advance but lacked the needed final
kick. THE BEST DISTANCE, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, faded between foes entering the lane. HACHURE,
reserved off the second flight while angling inwards racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance near the inside after a half, was held up out of close
quarters and quickly came up empty. DRINKING STORM (IRE) broke slowly, dropped off the field, was outdistanced racing into the stretch but walked off
the course under his own power.

Footnotes
RIDE INTO THE SKY broke readily, stalked just off the pacesetter racing into the turn, made a steady advance on that rival to challenge for command in
upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear late under firm encouragement. FORWARD MOTION sprinted clear of the field soon after the start,
dictated the pace a bit off the rail racing into the turn, briefly resisted the winner's bid but proved no match late. LIBERTARIAN settled well off the field while
angled to the inside racing through the backstretch, gathered momentum nearing upper stretch, split foes just off the inside entering upper stretch and
continued with interest to prevail for a share. HIGH FIVE COTTON tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn, shifted out four wide in
upper stretch and finished evenly. QUICK ENTRY tracked just off the second flight four wide between foes in the opening quarter, was fanned five wide
racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. STRIKING HEIR, urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter racing into the bend, shifted off the rail
racing into upper stretch and emptied out. SIX CIDER, caught five wide through the backstretch to the turn, came up empty nearing the lane. WELD angled
to the inside tracking off the second flight racing into the turn and faded into upper stretch. ANDREW THE BULL was under pressure early but quickly
dropped out.

Footnotes
STUY TOWN BABY angled to the inside gaining a position tracking off the first flight under light rating racing to the backstretch, briefly awaited an opening
nearing upper stretch, came through entering the lane to challenge for command inside the pacesetter and edged forward under firm handling. MAJESTIC
QUEEN, washy in the post parade, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset, dueled for command inside foes to the far turn, shifted off the
rail in upper stretch, couldn't contain the winner but continued gamely to prevail for the place honors. LONG STORY SHORT, held up avoiding tight quarters
at the start, angled to the inside settling into stride leaving the chute, continued inside foes to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn to upper stretch
and continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair. STRICT VOW, off slowly, was settled last near the inside, switched outside foes on the far turn,
advanced four wide, then five wide into upper stretch and improved her position to the end. DONNAMEUP tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to
the backstretch, dropped back while avoiding some close quarters nearing the second bend, saved ground on the far turn to upper stretch and continued
with a second effort to regain some position. PASSIONFORTREASURE, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way
into upper stretch. LASTING JOY tracked the leaders off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted three wide nearing the far turn to lodge a brief
bid on the second bend but soon flattened out. BIZNESS BEAUTY settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, steadied out of tight
quarters nearing the far turn, then angled out six wide racing into the stretch while never mounting a serious challenge. PEARLS FOR JOSIE settled outside
foes racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. MISS WROTE was urged to terms with the first flight three wide prompting the pace to the backstretch
but retreated after a half.
