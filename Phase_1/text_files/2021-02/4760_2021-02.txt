Footnotes
EVEN THUNDER , unhurried down the backstretch, advanced three deep to challenge for the lead outside COLONEL JUAN mid way on the far turn, dueled
with that one through the stretch and narrowly prevailed. COLONEL JUAN , three wide the first turn, advanced in the two path to bid for the lead between
horses mid way on the far turn, battled inside the winner and just missed. WALK AWAY JOE saved ground the first turn, raced in the two path on the far
turn, angled to the three path turning for home and rallied outside horses. JAMMINWITHBRANDON stalked the pace racing along the inner rail, remained
inside horses in the stretch and failed to be a menace. LECTRIC CHOKE lacked speed, circled both turns three deep, drifted to the four path entering the
stretch and lacked a rally. TEAM EFFORT opened a clear lead on the first turn, hugged the inner rail and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SCORESWHENHEWANTS tracked three wide outside the leader, bid to threaten leaving the half mile marker, dueled under some rating past the three
eighths, secured command into the lane, spurted clear after being set down past the quarter pole, kept on under right handed rousing and prevailed. BLUE
SKY PAINTER settled inside, eased out when picking up steam past the three furlong marker, angled five wide for the drive, made a grinding run under
pressure but just could not get up. RUNNER RUNNER INDY pulled his way forward while saving ground past the five furlong pole, stalked the leaders mid
turn, continued inside through the drive, lodged a bid in deep stretch but wasn't quite good enough. HOLY SAINT edged up between rivals early on, stalked
outside a rival mid turn, shifted four wide under pressure into the lane, chased and came up empty. GHOST ON A MISSION , under a firm hold through the
opening quarter while in range, was coaxed along three wide mid turn, angled six wide in upper stretch but failed to respond. KORCZAK cleared early, set
the pace two wide, was joined leaving the far turn, sparred to the inside of the winner into the lane then weakened in the final furlong. FIND YOUR BOAZ
lagged off the pace, swung well wide into the lane but failed to generate a response.

CRYING FOR MORE sprinted to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail and was kept to his business in the drive. RIBBONS AND MEDALS , two
wide chasing the winner around the turn, failed to rally. MR. SHADES OF GRAY saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and
finished evenly. BIG EDDIE B bumped with CHAUFFEUR leaving the starting gate, was a bit rank in traffic soon after the start, circled the turn four deep
and flattened out in the stretch run. SEBASTIAN , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened. UNCOMMON VALOR raced near the inner rail
on the turn while outrun. CHAUFFEUR bumped with BIG EDDIE B leaving the starting gate, was outrun and bumped with BAKENEKO when drifting out in
upper stretch. BAKENEKO , three wide while outrun around the turn, bumped with CHAUFFEUR in upper stretch.

HIGHER PURPOSE quickly went clear, set a rated pace in about the two path, moved away without much asking heading to the quarter pole, responded
when set down past the three sixteenths then held sway while kept to task. FIVE CARD DRAW stalked the winner three wide, saw that one get away past
the three eighths, was under pressure pursuing into the lane and kept on with good energy to bridge the gap. VICTORY GIVEN settled off the pace two
wide, dropped in near mid stretch and churned on willingly. TOP ME OFF , taken off the rail soon after the break, was under asking mid turn, shifted five
wide for the drive and had a belated response. JACK STRAIGHT , fractious in the gate, was taken to rate while saving ground, steadied near the four and a
half furlong marker, angled out leaving the far turn, raced six wide in upper stretch and had a mild kick. TICKER TAPE PARADE broke a step slow, pulled
his way forward between runners in the opening furlong, chased to the inside of a rival mid turn then faded in the final furlong.

SCAMPER ALONG sprinted to the lead leaving the backstretch, opened up on the turn and was kept under pressure in the drive. ELOQUENT LADY , a bit
rank at the break, was in hand along the inner rail mid way on the turn waiting for room, swung to the four path in upper stretch and rallied. HOT CHOICE
bumped with FAMILY FORTUNE soon after the start, chased the pace three deep on the turn and weakened in the drive. WINGS OF FIRE bumped with
FAMILY FORTUNE at the start, steadied in traffic leaving the backstretch, chased the pace inside horses and weakened late. SCARLET TANAGER , four
deep on the turn, was not a factor. SUZZETTE STAR dropped back along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and failed to rally.
FAMILY FORTUNE , jostled leaving the starting gate, was not a factor. LOOKIN FOR CANDY chased the pace around the turn, gave way and was eased
late.

Footnotes
APRILNESS rated forwardly outside rivals, lodged a bold four wide bid to engage the leader mid turn, secured command into the lane, opened up under a
drive past the three sixteenths, drifted in and switched to her left lead past the furlong grounds then held firm while kept to task. COOKIES AND CREAM
advanced inside foes and put a head in front past the five eighths, shook clear and set the pace two wide wide into the turn, was joined from both sides mid
turn, shifted out once header into the lane then gave game chase to the wire. USED TO BE FUN settled off the pace while saving ground, awaited some
room near the quarter pole, angled four wide into the lane and closed willingly. EGG NOG chased two wide, dropped back to be in the clear mid turn, came
back slightly while between runners in mid stretch then flattened out. WHO'S YOUR DADDY prompted the pace along the rail, challenged mid turn, failed to
kick on past the three sixteenths then gave way. THUNDER THIGHS , three wide pressing outside the leader, weakened in upper stretch. SLIP SLIDIN ,
between rivals while making a mild run near the three eighths pole, pursued three wide past the five sixteenths, angled out for the drive and weakened.
SPRITZ OF SPRITE broke a step slow and was outrun. GYPSY'S IMAGE bore out at the break and was off a bit slowly, straightened and raced three wide
into the turn, angled six wide into the lane and weakened. TATICA , off a bit slowly, raced four wide nearing the quarter pole and failed to menace.

HYBRID ECLIPSE stalked the pace for six furlongs, swung to the three path leaving the far turn, swept to command approaching the sixteenth pole then
drew off. MIT MAZEL sprinted clear on the first turn, set the pace near the inner rail and weakened the final furlong. MALIBU BEAUTY , two wide chasing
the pace to upper stretch, tired. GOOD MEASURE , steadied in close quarters leaving the starting gate, saved ground the far turn, remained inside horses
in the stretch and failed to rally. WONDERWALL , angled outside mid way down the backstretch, circled the far turn four wide, floated to the five path turning
for home and lacked a rally. MARVELLA NASTY , three wide the first turn, was outrun. BETCHA BY GOLLY , well positioned in the two path on the far turn,
swung to the four path leaving the bend then gave way. TRIPLE DIGIT , four deep entering the first turn, was outrun.

Footnotes
PARDON THE PUN , three deep early, emerged in a duel outside a rival leaving the five eighths while in hand, shook clear after a half mile, came under
some asking near the three sixteenths, was put to strong urging past the furlong grounds and held firm. LIFESPAN settled off the rail, dove inside advancing
mid turn, moved up to have aim on the winner into the lane, continued gamely but could only gain a little in the last eighth. DAY OF HONOR was squeezed
back at the break, regrouped and edged up off the rail past the five eighths, dropped in to follow the runner-up past the five sixteenths, shifted back out near
mid stretch and churned on with interest. BOSTON BILLY saved ground, steadied behind a tiring rival leaving the far turn, angled out nearing the quarter
pole and rallied. ROYALIAN dropped back after being roughed at the break, made a five wide move nearing the lane, angled in approaching mid stretch and
kept trying. SWEET ASTA , four to five wide early on, angled nine wide while making some headway into the stretch, chased then flattened out. UNION
CHARM drifted out at the break and failed to menace. NEVERFOLD , four wide outside rivals, weakened. WAR LIGHT , reluctant to load, was outrun. EJE
GAMA chased off the rail, raced six to seven wide into the stretch and weakened. DON CICCIO rushed up inside rivals leaving the chute and gained a slim
lead, battled with the winner into the turn, failed to keep pace past the five sixteenths and gave way. TALE OF DIXIE , between rivals early while close up,
drop back some mid turn then steadied off heels when drifting out into the stretch. RICKY RICKY had speed between foes and contested the early pace,
chased from the five eighths to the far turn then faltered.
