Footnotes
DR FRANCES stalked the pace while two wide on the backstretch, rallied on the far turn then drew off and was kept to task in the end. CALESCENT was
allowed to settled while racing two wide on backstretch, rallied on the far turn making a bid but was second best in the end. BLAME IT ON MAMIE set the
early pace while being well handled, was in a long drive and weakened in the stretch. SILVER DEVIL was allowed to settled then raced three wide on the far
turn making a bid then failed to menace. DIEM NOW chased the early pace while inside, was sued up and gave way. SAMBORITA was unhurried early then
eased up in late stretch and walked off.
