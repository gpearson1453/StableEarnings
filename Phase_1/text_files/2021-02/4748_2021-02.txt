Footnotes
PRINCE OF RAIN broke slowly, moved up outside, raced three wide into the turn, was carried wide into the stretch while vying for command and drove
clear after five furlongs. EAGLES CRY lagged while wide into the stretch and finished fastest outside. MAINE brushed with MIZZEN MONEY early on the
backstretch, angled out looking for room, steadied nearing the turn and again two wide between horses entering the turn, steadied midway on the turn and
flattened out in the lane. AKTHAM opened a clear lead midway on the backstretch, stayed close to the rail around the turn, ran out entering the stretch then
weakened. CRAFTY JACK steadied midway on the backstretch, raced three wide around the turn and lacked a closing. MIZZEN MONEY brushed early with
MAINE, stayed inside and tired.

Footnotes
LADY JOANNA made the pace close to the rail and held under urging. ARCTICA ran inside the winner early, fell back, came out from the rail early on the
backstretch and lacked the needed closing. CALS MY PAL was slow early, raced three wide around the final turn and finished willingly outside. HEAVENLY
HATTIE broke slowly, was unhurried early, rallied the rail around the final turn, came out between rivals in the lane and steadied in late stretch.
RAISETONEW HEIGHTS lagged early, swung wide into the stretch and found best stride too late. AUDREY GRACE advanced outside on the backstretch,
dropped to the rail entering the far turn and tired. QUEEN STINKER was outrun.

TRUE WISDOM broke sharply, took turns on the front end while two wide, edged clear late then lasted while drifting. MEROCKETMAN was unhurried
inside, angled sharply to the outside in early stretch, was bumped leaving the furlong grounds, finished fastest and was steadied through the final yards. An
objection by Beato against the winner was not allowed. IRONBOUND dueled inside the winner into late stretch then weakened. PRAY WITH FAITH was
bumped while two wide between horses entering the turn and lacked a closing response. TOMMY'S TOP CAT was close up while three wide between
horses into the turn, bore out under left hand whip, bumped MEROCKETMAN leaving the furlong grounds and flattened out. C C'S WARRIOR bore out into
PRAY WITH FAITH entering the turn, improved position into the stretch then tired. COLORADO GRANDSLAM was close up outside early while in hand,
raced four wide around the turn, faded through the lane and was eased up in a useful outing. MISTER HUMOR trailed after a slow break.

THE BEST CANDY chased the early leader, advanced between horses before a half, fell back soon after, stayed out from the rail around the final turn,
closed outside through the lane and was up late. SMART TWO A T opened a clear lead soon after the break, moved clear again nearing the far turn,
remained clear into the final sixteenth but couldn't last. AVIE'S MESA made a run along the rail around the final turn, came out for the drive and finished
willingly. THE GREAT CASBY settled three wide, swung wide into the stretch and gained too late. BUILT THAT WAY was fractious in the gate, broke slowly
then was eased up through the final three furlongs.
