READY FOR CHANGE tracked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead in upper stretch, inched clear under hand urging into
the final furlong, responded well under two taps of a down-turned whip into the final sixteenth and held under good handling. LADY ANNA broke out at the
start, settled comfortably off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, drafted inside to the quarter-pole then was asked, moved out
while put to a drive in upper stretch, chased the winner determinedly on the outside under vigorous urging, inched closer to that foe late but missed while
well clear for the place. SEVEN JEWELS was sent hard to the lead, showed the way in the two path through the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the
advantage to the winner at the three-sixteenths and weakened but held the show. MUCH ABOUT IT broke in at the start then was hustled, dropped well
behind under urging, saved ground on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch then quickly moved further out and failed to threaten. SIKUM broke out and
hit the gate, settled on the outside, went four wide under some urging on the turn, drifted in inside the quarter-pole and faltered. ALL TIMES WERE

of the first turn then shifted three wide, tracked outside early on the backstretch, moved up to make a bid at the nine-sixteenths, took a short lead while three
wide on the far turn, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match for the winner while just able to get the place. GOOD INTENT

safe advantage under steady urging to secure her fourth straight victory. YES I'M EVIL went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, chased four
wide on the far turn, passed the quarter-pole under the whip, gained on the winner late and finished willingly for the place. MATT'S HONEY was hustled

drive and proved no match for the top two but just held the show. MALIBU MOIRA went four wide on the first turn, was reserved under a tight hold, dropped
from the two path to the rail while asked early on the far turn, chased into the stretch and proved no match for the top two then just missed the show.
GLANCE was hustled from the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, steadied behind MARRAZANO as that foe retreated outside
the three-eighths pole, raced inside to the two path on the far turn and failed to threaten. MARRAZANO broke out and bumped with a foe, showed speed on
the inside, was eased back off the pace late on the first turn then rated down the backstretch, dropped back under some urging outside the seven-sixteenths
and retreated. DESHA was bumped at the start and forced into another rival, saved ground on the first turn, moved out towards the rear with five furlongs to
run, was urged four wide on the far turn and failed to respond. MILA'S DREAM (IRE) bumped with a rival at the start, was taken in hand early, went four

urging on the far turn, moved out in pursuit of the runner-up in upper stretch, gained into the final furlong and got up in the final strides under strong urging.
YANKEE CLIPPER went four wide on the first turn, moved up late on that bend to contest the pace, went clear early on the backstretch, controlled the
action in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, drifted in while still on his inside lead at the three-sixteenths, swapped to the proper
lead when pulled in by the rider at the furlong marker, led under the whip into the final sixteenth and was caught in the final strides while well clear for the
place. BASSETT was taken up briefly between horses early, went five wide early on the first turn, dropped to three then two wide later on that bend, settled

far turn, chased into upper stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole and weakened then just missed the show. WHEELS TURNING bumped twice soundly
with a foe at the start then checked while pinched back, went four to five wide on the first turn, settled near the back, was urged three then four wide on the
far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to threaten. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT went six wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace, dropped
from the two path to the rail under urging on the far turn and was no factor. TENCENTSUPERHOOP bumped hard twice with a foe at the start, was caught
seven wide on the first turn, lagged at the back of the field, dropped from the four path to the two path on the far turn and showed little. JOEBOY showed
speed while three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace down the backstretch, was urged three wide on the far turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and

three to two wide under urging on the far turn and failed to respond. BIGBOYSHOWSHART broke open the front of his stall door prior to the start but
remained in the stall, went four to five wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and also failed to respond. TENSAS

on the turn, was driven into upper stretch,d dropped back into the final furlong and tired. QUALITY OF MERCY was hard to load, angled in under urging
near the half-mile pole, went three then four wide on the turn and came up empty. GLITTERARY was urged along towards the back, dropped in to save
ground on the turn and was no factor. ARBITRARY was bumped at the start, showed speed on the outside of two foes, was carried four wide into the turn,
dropped to the three then two path on that bend and capitulated. PAYTONSATTHEPLATE was reluctant to load, showed speed on the outside then chased
the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went five wide on the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
NO PEDIGREE showed speed on the outside then stalked the leading trio, made a bid while three to four wide on the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and
proved much the best under steady urging. RANCH BADGE showed good speed between horses, was taken back off the pace late on the backstretch,
went two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and safely secured the place. COFFEE COUNTY settled near the back, was
urged four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and improved position to get the show. GIMMEASOUND showed speed on the inside of three
foes, vied along the rail under urging on the turn, dropped back under the whip in upper stretch and weakened. BUNKIE'S SONG disputed the pace
between horses, vied in the two to three path while still between horses on the turn, dropped back under the whip into upper stretch and tired. COACH
KENNY settled on the outside while near the back, went five to six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, drifted in near the three-sixteenths
then lugged in around the furlong marker and was no factor. BIG MERRILL angled in towards the rear early, went around the turn in the two path, moved
out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. GYPSY'S SOULMATE settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the turn and failed to respond. FIFTY
PROTECTION settled on the outside, was urged four then five wide on the turn then driven six wide into the stretch and also failed to respond.
