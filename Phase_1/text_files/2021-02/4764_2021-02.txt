EL SOBREVIVIENTE just of leader to turn, responded well to go clear with a good effort. WELLMAN up close inside to the turn, stayed on gamely to the
wire for pace spot. MIDNIGHT FIRE four wide run to turn, never far back but outkicked in the stretch. CITY DRIFTER raced evenly while never a factor. C F
V RED NOVA was never a factor. FIRE SWORD sharp speed to the turn, surrendered in a dull effort through the stretch seemingly disliking surface. J C'S
CHAMP sluggish start, inside run to turn while never a factor.
