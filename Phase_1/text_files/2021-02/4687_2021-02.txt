Footnotes
BEACH CHICK went clear soon after the start, rated along through an even pace for six furlongs, settled into the stretch well in command, drifted out while
laboring late and was saved by the wire. DISPENSE saved ground in range to the stretch, moved out with a bid into the final furlong and just missed
between horses. BACKSPARK bumped with TALK DIRTY after the start, saved ground for six furlongs, moved out for the drive and was gaining outside the
top two near the wire. MISS MORENO bumped with BELLA SOFI after a sixteenth of a mile or so, was bumped between that one and ALLIE AND JAZZY
and checked into the first turn four wide, moved inward after that, and offered a mild response for the last major share. TALK DIRTY hopped at the break
and bumped with TRASHTHETRAILER, then bumped with BACKSPARK, got forced out five wide outside troubled foes into the first turn, and never reached
contention. TRASHTHETRAILER hopped at the start, then got ping-ponged between TALK DIRTY and ASPROPODIA coming out. and was never in the
hunt. ASPROPODIA bumped with TRASHTHETRAILER at the start, got forced out six wide into the first turn, and remained far back. ALLIE AND JAZZY
bumped with MISS MORENO going to the first turn, raced four wide and was finished before completing six furlongs. BELLA SOFI bumped with MISS
MORENO very early on, checked sharply while crowded and rank heading to the first turn and bumped with that foe again, remained hard to handle and
faltered after six furlongs. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUN ENTERING THE FIRST TURN BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE
OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
LADY FIORELLA was off a bit slow, advanced four wide around the far turn, angled into the three path near the five-sixteenths pole, made steady progress
widest, took over near the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a drive. FREEZER BURN set a clear pace along the rail, was collared near the sixteenth pole
but held clear of the rest. STARSHIP BLANCA saved ground in midpack, angled out in upper stretch and was along for the show. TWILIGHT GALAXY
stalked the pace three wide for a half, bid two wide nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. SIMPLE STORY failed to menace while racing four
and five wide. GRAVEL GERTIE had early speed two wide and was through after a half. AUBURN played no factor while racing three wide.

SHOO SHINE grabbed the lead after the start, separated from his pursuers after a half-mile slightly off the rail, and responded to pressure to remain in
control. BRACCIO DI FERRO bumped with SIDARTH at the start, moved off the inside to the two-path around the turn, battled shoulder to shoulder inside
KHOZANDO through the stretch and prevailed for the place. KHOZANDO chased three wide to the stretch, stayed on his left lead and was outfinished for
second. SIDARTH bumped with BRACCIO DI FERRO at the start, stayed in range to the turn, and faded steadily. UNCLE PIP was finished early two wide.

MAP EM UP set the pace along the rail and held firm under a drive. SECRETS KEPT saved ground in midpack, angled three wide in upper stretch and
rallied. BRYNBELLA prompted the winner two wide, bid nearing the lane but was outfinished. KHOSEA saved ground off the pace, went two wide around
the far turn, came four wide into the lane and made some gain outside. JOY IN GRACE failed to menace while racing two and three wide. THE RUN-UP
WAS UNAVAILABLE.

SHEZA HAPPY GIRL broke out bumping MISS MIKAELA into LUNAR BLAST, saved ground behind the dueling leaders to the turn, waited from the
five-sixteenths to the quarter-pole before switching out three wide, rallied to the front from outside with a furlong remaining and drove clear. THE BIGGEST
ONE vied inside CHISPITA from the outset, drifted out slightly with 70 yards to run and held off that rival for the place. CHISPITA contested the pace outside
THE BIGGEST ONE, fought on between horses through mid stretch, got pushed out a bit late and was edged for second. MISS MIKAELA got bumped
between horses, lacked room and steadied back at the start, advanced while shifting out four wide after a half-mile, but flattened out in the stretch. JEDI
JANE bumped with LUNAR BLAST at the start, raced four wide and posed no threat. LUNAR BLAST was bumped between horses at the start, and trailed
inside.

Footnotes
CALL CURT settled off the pace while racing two wide, swung four wide turning for home, closed outside while stuck on the left lead, switched in midstretch,
seized command soon after, powered clear under left-handed urging and held comfortable while take in hand late. EXULT saved ground off the pace,
swung five wide turning for home and rallied widest. GIMME SOME MO rated back four wide around the first turn, made a strong four wide move around the
far turn, put a head in front near the eighth pole but flattened out through the final furlong. AMERICAN PHENOM pressed the pace two wide, bid between
foes nearing the lane, battled on through midstretch then weakened a bit. TURN OF EVENTS chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally.
MAJESTIC RO set the pace along the rail and gave way nearing the eighth pole. TEMPLET was in range inside, was driven along to keep pace along the
rail rounding the far turn then lacked room through the stretch run. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED. RUN-UP AND FRACTIONS WERE UNAVAILABLE.

WORLD TOUR settled within striking range early, came out to go after UNSHAKABLE U turning for home, responded through the furlong grounds to take
over from outside, and edged clear under a hand drive. UNSHAKABLE U set the pace inside, could not withstand the top one with a sixteenth remaining,
but held well for the place. MUNNYFOR RO was outrun two wide for six furlongs, swung widest of all for the drive and finished well. DEEMED ESSENTIAL
prompted the pace two to three wide, and weakened in upper stretch. SEMBLE JUSTE (IRE) stayed close for six furlongs near the three-path, and lacked a
closing response. IRIS THE EMPRESS saved ground to the far turn, moved out three wide at the top of the lane, and could not threaten. SANURA broke
two lengths slow, and was never prominent. MAKE ME LAUGH steadied lacking room approaching the first turn, and was through before reaching the
stretch. MISS EMPIREMENT steadied approaching the first turn, and was always outrun. KAY'S PROJECT saved ground close up to the far turn, and was
empty outside the quarter-pole. WILL TAKE ALL became fractious and unseated the rider behind the gate, broke a bit slow and was never prominent.

Footnotes
HONOLULU EXPRESS set the pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch and held sway under a drive. PLEASE SIT DOWN raced well back early,
advanced five wide around the turn, sustained the run through the lane and narrowed much of the gap. DARK AGES raced off the pace outside, bid four
wide nearing the lane, flattened out in the stretch but stayed on well enough to gain the show position. GREEN MANSIONS vied outside of the winner early,
remained up close two wide around the turn and weakened in the drive. JUST LIKE MIKE saved ground in range and lacked a closing bid. GANGLY hopped
at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. CHARLIE THE GREEK stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane.

J P HELLISH broke to the lead but relinquished the advantage soon afterward, was pocketed and steadied inside on the first turn, stayed close to the top of
the stretch, came through an ample opening to challenge for command between BALISTICO and KROY with a furlong remaining, and outdueled the latter
through the closing stages. KROY prompted the pace outside BALISTICO, bid for command at the top of the stretch, stayed on his left lead through a long
drive and was bested outside the winner. FREEDOM MATTERS raced four then three wide in range to the stretch, lacked a solid closing response and was
just up outside for the show. BALISTICO took the lead after J P HELLISH yielded going to the first turn, dug in when challenged turning for home, but gave
way past the eighth-pole. SOUPER JAGUAR went along in the two-path to the stretch, and made no headway. MY POINT EXACTLY was reserved early
following behind the eventual winner, remained inside and lacked the needed response when roused. TOTONO was no factor inside. MONY raced two to
three wide, and tired after a half-mile. RUN-UP DISTANCE UNAVAILABLE.

HOTSY TOTSY (IRE) settled two wide in midpack, swung four wide to bid between foes near the quarter pole, took the lead approaching the eighth pole,
battled on inside of the HOLYANNA from there and dug in gamely to prevail. HOLYANNA raced well back three wide, circled five wide around the far turn,
bid outside of the winner in upper stretch, battled to the wire but was denied. FEATURE CREATURE lacked early speed while racing two wide, angled out in
upper stretch and rallied for the show. AIZU hopped at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide and ran on to improve position in the lane. FOLLOW
THE FLAG stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out to bid between rivals in upper stretch then weakened through the final furlong. HERA saved ground in
midpack, briefly steadied in upper stretch and lacked any further bids. ZODIAC PRINCESS had speed between foes, was taken in hand while appearing to
try to get out around the first turn, stalked the pace in the three path from there, bid nearing the lane, briefly led in upper stretch and wilted. BEAM OF LIGHT
chased the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. ALL COME TRUE (FR) set the pace in the two path and stopped in the lane.
