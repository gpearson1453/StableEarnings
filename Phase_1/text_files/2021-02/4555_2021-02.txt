Footnotes
MS V TIME pressed IZSHEFROSTED from outside, took over with five-sixteenths remaining, moved clear through upper stretch under pressure and held
JAMSSTAR at a safe distance. JAMSSTAR advanced around the turn four wide, could not reach the winner but finished willingly to best the others.
NUSCAA saved ground behind the early leaders, moved out three wide into the stretch, and lacked a solid rally. IZSHEFROSTED became fractious in the
gate unseating the rider prior to the start, broke alertly and was hustled to the lead inside, could not hold off MS V TIME before completing a half-mile, and
faded. HASHTAG LUCKY was no factor inside. KAREN'S WAY showed brief speed outside, and dropped back on the turn. TROUBLE MAKING was
finished early two to three wide.

Footnotes
MOON PISTOL hopped at the start to be away well last, trailed two wide for a half, angled five wide into the lane, closed outside, took the lead near the
sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. DECKOLOGY settled off the early pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, bid between rivals in
midstretch, fought on inside of the winner through the final sixteenth but was slightly outkicked. IT'S A RISK stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the
quarter pole, vied to midstretch and weakened a bit in the final furlong. DREAM D'ORO set the pace along the rail and gave way leaving the eighth pole.
BLACK HOPE raced two wide and never threatened. MONEY COME prompted the pace two wide and tired in the drive. MORE THAN USUAL lacked speed
while saving ground, swung widest in upper stretch and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
FOXXY BELLE eyed the dueling leaders around the turn, ranged up three wide to challenge outside PRECOCIOUS PEACH at the head of the stretch, and
drew clear through the last furlong under hand urging. PRECOCIOUS PEACH vied outside COIN THE PHRASE for three furlongs, got the best of that
dispute while being overhauled by the eventual winner turning for home, and stayed on well for the place. EXTRA EFFORT saved ground throughout, and
finished evenly. REAGAN'S ROSE was no menace two wide. COIN THE PHRASE vied inside PRECOCIOUS PEACH for three-eighths of a mile, and tired.
LOVE DADDY showed little inside.

Footnotes
BERHANU stalked the pace in the clear in the three path, reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths pole, dueled outside to midstretch then drew off
under left-handed urging. BEEBOO set the pace in the two path, resisted inside the winner from the five-sixteenths to midstretch but was no match in the
final furlong. LITTLE DUDE settled off the top two while saving ground, tipped out in upper stretch, lacked a rally and bested the rest. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT
hopped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. JIMBO failed to menace while racing three wide. PARMENIDES was outrun while racing four
wide. CHAMPION UP chased the pace four wide and was through after three furlongs. EL TABERNERO ONE lunged at the start and trailed inside.

Footnotes
BAREEQA was allowed to settle early, came four wide advancing after six furlongs, collared NANTUCKET RED from outside into the final furlong and
proved best. NANTUCKET RED was keyed up at the back after the start, got taken out widest being given her head approaching the first turn, stayed well
out in the course taking over from ITSAKEYPER entering the backstretch, remained out in the three-path, showing the way around the far turn and into the
stretch, stayed on her left lead and could not handle the winner late. I'M LISTENING went along two wide to the far turn, moved out widest in upper stretch
and rallied mildly. UNICORN SALLY was outrun early inside, came out to the two-path leaving the far turn, went back in rallying through upper stretch, then
flattened out. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN saved ground forwardly placed early, entered the far turn between horses two then three wide, and faded after six
furlongs. OUR LITTLE JEWEL raced close up for six furlongs, and tired into the stretch four wide. ITSAKEYPER set the early pace inside, yielded to
NANTUCKET RED leaving the first turn, and was empty a quarter-mile out.

Footnotes
PUTMAN stalked the pace two wide, steadily gained through the lane, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a drive. GOING FOR
GOLD set the pace along the rail, was collared near the sixteenth pole and held well to preserve the place. GRAINGER COUNTY bumped with WILD ONE
FOREVER soon after the start, had speed between, bumped with FRENCH REEF nearing the turn, chased three wide between foes around the bend and
was one-paced in the lane to hold the show. ROMARIO steadied twice in the initial furlong, raced well back three wide and rallied belatedly. HUSHED
HIJINKS lacked some early speed, advanced two wide between foes rounding the turn but flattened out in the lane. OUR DESTINY went evenly two wide.
WILD ONE FOREVER was bumped soon after the start, raced four wide and made little impact. BROADCAST TIME was outrun inside. BERNIN' THRU
GOLD failed to menace while racing three wide. FRENCH REEF (IRE) was bumped nearing the turn, raced in range four wide and retreated under minimal
stretch urging.

Footnotes
REAL TALK sped to the front with a sharp start, rated along in the two-path around the turn, got set down in upper stretch and widened under pressure.
GATSBY stayed close inside to the stretch, and held well for the place without menacing the top one. CAJUN COMMANDER advanced three wide past the
quarter-pole, but could not sustain the rally. AMPERSAND broke slowly, raced three to four wide around the turn, and could not gain. BAILEY broke slowly,
steadied slightly on the rail past the half-mile marker, and lacked a response. TIZ HANDSOME chased outside REAL TALK for three furlongs, and had
nothing left.

MAI TY ONE ON tracked the pace three wide, closed determinedly through the lane and was up in deep stretch. YES I AM FREE stalked the pace two
wide, took the lead near the eighth pole and led until deep stretch. CITRUS BURST saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and rallied for the
show. BLIND AMBITION saved ground in midpack and lacked the needed rally. DARE DAY set the pace along the rail to the eighth pole and tired. SAIL AT
SUNRISE played no factor while racing two wide. BOJINGLE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
KARTANO broke slowly and trailed inside to the far turn, swung widest of all entering the stretch, and kicked in strongly late to win going away.
EXPONENTIAL raced in the second flight three to four wide for six furlongs, rallied to reach the front from outside with a sixteenth to go, but was overhauled
nearing the finish. COMMAND CENTRAL settled in the middle of the field two to three wide to the head of the lane, and finished with good courage between
horses. POLITICAL RIOT was slow into stride, swung six wide coming off the far turn, and rallied for the last major share. THE ZIP FACTOR was forwardly
placed early inside, came three wide into the stretch, lodged a bid between horses through the furlong grounds but was outfinished. KATHERN'S JOY
established the pace inside, responded when hooked by BELLA FUTURE on the far turn, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. CONGRATS
AGAIN saved ground to the far turn on hold, entered the stretch two wide, was stymied behind the leaders with a furlong remaining, never gained clearance
and was being steadied along through the last 50 yards. SETTE STELLE worked his way inside early, cut the corner into the stretch, lacked room behind a
wall of horses and could never be set down. BELLA FUTURE was four wide pressing the pace around the first turn, reached the front outside KATHERN'S
JOY after six furlongs, stayed on to mid stretch and gave way. SUPPLICATION was no factor inside. TORQUE stayed in range three wide to the stretch,
and tired. GAEL POWER was slow to begin, and never reached contention.
