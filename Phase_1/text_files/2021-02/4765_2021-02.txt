Footnotes
THE GLENMORE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole under threat to the outside,
took the inside route into upper stretch and drew off under a drive kept to task. FLOWER'S FORTUNE three wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, advanced on the leader to get on near even terms, continued three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for that rival through the final
furlong while well clear of the rest to be along second best. BEWPS chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home
and weakened. ELEGANT LAOBAN chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired.
FLIRTACIOUS KISS coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing three furlongs out, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
FAIR REGIS put an an abbreviated brisk hand ride to establish the top, was then switched over to a firm hold after accomplishing the mission, showed the
way, tailed by SISTER PATRICIA to her right, began to shake off the nemesis as the half was being completed, was making her way through the furlong
grounds when the rider went to work, kept her commanding advantage, then polished off the final seventy yards having been geared down. FAIR LASSIE
off a length the tardiest, slid over to the inside route approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, came into the stretch and clearly proved no match today.
DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS rode the rail, came under a ride after stepping onto the turn, angled three wide towards the three-sixteenths pole, was along for
show. AMOS three wide onto the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, lacked the necessary response. AWESOME ALANA tracked the
pace from path two in midpack, got worked into the five path from upper to midstretch, came up empty. SISTER PATRICIA prompted the winner from the
two path for nearly a half before folding.

Footnotes
GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS coaxed from the gate, went four wide into the first turn and advanced three to four wide through that bend to settle three wide down
the backstretch attending the leader to the outside, remained patiently handled until the pace quickened on the far turn and came under coaxing nearing the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home taking over narrow command straightened away into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat from a
trio a furlong out, shook off the former leader inside that station confronted by a pair near the sixteenth marker and gamely held sway by a nostril to the wire.
TWISTED TOM along the inside through the opening bend, chased three then two wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun three wide for home, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong getting on near even terms for command inside the final sixteenth battling on
game and just missed at the end. FIRST LINE bobbled forward at the break, led early on before easing off to track the pace along the inside, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final eighth latching on between the top pair
nearing the sixteenth pole through to the finish and was ultimately denied at the end in a good effort. DARK STORM three wide into the first turn,
established the front and tucked to the two path into the backstretch under close attendance by the eventual winner to the outside, showed the way in hand
tucking inside half a mile from home, floated to the two path briefly midway on the turn placed to coaxing, took the inside route into upper stretch under
challenge, got headed for command straightened away, dug in battling on to just inside the eighth pole and then weakened in the late stages. LEGIT broke
in at the start and was taken in hand, chased along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper
stretch and offered no response. DEEP SEA chased two then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled four to five wide into upper stretch
and weakened.

RUVIES IN TIME established control in short order, showed the way from along the inside route, rated, was nearing the three-sixteenths marker when
switched over to stronger handling, dug in to fend off the second place finisher. MISS JIMMY sneaked her way into the pocket at the top of the turn, kept
within striking distance of the winner, tipped into the two path at the head of the stretch, went after RUVIES IN TIME in earnest, got staved off. FIGHT ON
LUCY remained stationed towards the inside after the field had been released, chased the pace hand urged from the early stages onward, angled three
wide into the stretch, stayed on for the show. DUBLINORNOTHIN off the inside, raced three wide on the turn, got roused at the three-sixteenths pole,
flattened out. IMPAZIBLE DONNA stalked the winner from the two path for the opening half, gave way. COURAGEOUS GIRL bobbled at the start, brought
up the back of the pack in the two path on the turn, swung out three wide turning into the lane, never made its presence felt.

Footnotes
THREE TWO ZONE broke out a step at the start under coaxing and bumped KID CASH into ROYAL REALM forcing that rival to be taken in hand,
established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn shaking away through the latter
portion of the bend, took the inside route into upper stretch and drew off under a drive holding well to the finish. DAZZLE TIME coaxed from the gate,
chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and ran on to chase the winner home clear for the
place honors. KID CASH got bumped at the start by THREE TWO ZONE and in turn bumped ROYAL REALM taking over that rival's lane and forcing him to
be taken in hand, chased along the inside and was bumped by QUICK INTRO who grew a bit erratic near the five-eighths as DAZZLE TIME tucked over
from the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and kept on to secure the show honors. RUDY ROD reluctant to
load prior to the start, got coaxed from the gate and chased four then three wide, came under urging midway on the turn, continued three to four wide into
upper stretch, kept on to the finish but was outkicked. GOLD BEAR coaxed from the gate, chased four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and made no headway. ROYAL REALM got bumped at the start by KID CASH and was forced to steady when losing his lane to that
rival due to pressure begun by the outwards breaking THREE TWO ZONE, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to
four wide for home and tired. RUN WHITE RABBIT broke in at the start and was corrected, chased along the inside under coaxing from midway on the turn,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. QUICK INTRO hustled from the gate, chased three paths off the inside under coaxing from
the get go, came inwards slightly bumping with KID CASH near the five-eighths marker when DAZZLE TIME tucked over from the outside, lost position to
the rear of the field and tucked to the two path through the turn, swung three to four wide for home, tired and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
ADHWAA remained stationed along the inside route after the field had been sent off and running, after making some contact with MIA BEA STAR in the
shadow of the gate, was under a drive cutting the corner into the stretch, slipped into the two path a sixteenth down the road, gained access to path three
after the second place shifted into the four path after some left side pressure in midstretch, availed of the opportunity and was maneuvered onto it, closed in
on the fighting front runners in tandem with BARISTA VIXEN, exchanged bumps with the aforementioned foe narrowly claiming the top in deep stretch, dug
in gamely to stay in the clear. BARISTA VIXEN recovered after stumbling badly at the start, worked out a tuck into the two path at the half mile pole, was put
to a drive spinning three wide into the stretch, went into path four after some left side stick work in midstretch, inadvertently creating a usable avenue for the
eventual winner, rallied abreast of that rival, saw the top twosome trade off some bumps in the final stages, wound up the one to be denied. MAGNETIQUE
sighted pulling on the left, showed the way from path two on the backstretch, slid over closer to the rail after departing it, was put to the test by MIA BEA
STAR as three-quarters was being completed, got set down, went at it eye to eye with the nemesis, had the first two finishers inch by in the final seventy
yards, salvaged the show. MIA BEA STAR settled along the rail after brushing with another right after the start, slipped into path two at the midway point of
the turn, crept up to the leader, got called upon as a spirited tussle between them got sparked off, raced on dead terms down the lane, ultimately having to
settle for the last major check. WICKED AMBER forwardly placed early, raced three wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path wider, gave way.
PENDOLINO strung out four wide on the turn, went into the five path for the drive, tired.

BANK STING chased along the inside down the backstretch, tipped out two then three wide at the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung four then three wide into upper stretch straightened away, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking over command nearing the
sixteenth pole, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. I'M FINE chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six
wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors. ELLARELLA was forwardly placed along the inside, ranged up to take command just
inside six furlongs remaining, showed the way in hand down along the rail under attendance from MABEL ISLAND to the outside, remained patiently
handled as that rival got busy through the latter portion of the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch and was set down for the drive, dug in under
threat getting overtaken nearing the sixteenth marker, kept on to preserve the show honors. MABEL ISLAND led early on crossing to the two path and was
headed by the aforementioned foe, attended that rival from the outside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got on near even terms spinning just off
the inside for home, dug in latched on through to inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. OK HONEY chased three then four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. NEW YORK ROCK STAR chased two to three wide under
coaxing from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. ENGLISH BREEZE bobbled at the break, chased along the inside under a
ride from midway on the turn, cornered just off the inside for home and tired. ALPHADORA chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. MY MY MICHELLE broke out at the start and was steadied, chased three to four paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then five wide through the turn, went eight wide into upper stretch and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
BRUNATE sparred for control from the two path, challenged in earnest after stepping onto the top of the lane, emerged in charge at the eighth pole, drew
well clear, under a hand drive crossing the finish line. ROYAL KAZ along the inside, vied for the top matched up with the winner, saw their contest pick up in
intensity at the top of the lane, proved no match, stayed on to save second. WHATS IN IT FOR ME fidgeting about in its stall, was tossing its head as the
field was sent on its way, got away two lengths the slowest after lunging into the left side of the gate, cut over to the rail, took it until the five-sixteenths pole,
was on the march to the outside springing from that station, completed the maneuvered in the neighborhood of six path by the furlong grounds, rallied down
the center of the strip to earn the show award. ALITE took up position in the pocket after losing its footing at the start, cut the corner into the lane, got
outkicked late. LORD CAMDEN bumped with FREUDIAN ANALYST in the shadow of the starting gate, got set up in midpack, travelled four wide on the
turn, was about wide heading home, made no headway. SIMBASALLTROUBLE bumped at the start, was rated two wide in midpack for much of the initial
half, ventured into the stretch, lacked the needed response. TALESPIN two wide onto the turn, got sent out five wide leaving it, made no impact. FREUDIAN
ANALYST bumped from each end at the break, took the inside route, angled three wide entering the stretch, failed to fire. MOONSHINE MAKER pursued
the pace three wide, gave way after going a half. THEITALIANAMERICAN on the rail well before arriving at the half mile pole, stayed put until the end of the
bend, swung out three wide for the drive, had no offering.
