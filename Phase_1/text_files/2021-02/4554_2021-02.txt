Footnotes
ROUSING SLAMMER contested the pace outside of BOURBONWITHATWIST and three wide to the stretch, responded to inch clear to mid stretch then
held on determinedly. BOURBONWITHATWIST dueled inside the winner while racing off the rail to the stretch, drifted inward nearing the furlong marker and
crowded COPPER HALO then straightened but could not catch the winner. COPPER HALO chased the top two from the rail to the stretch, made a bid
inside of BOURBONWITHATWIST but was crowded by that one, steadied at the furlong marker, angled out but could not make an impact late.
THEYREMINISCEOVERU broke a bit slow, had no speed and trailed three then four wide to the stretch and lacked the needed late response. DOGHOUSE
chased the pace three wide to the stretch then gave way in the final furlong. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run involving
BOURBONWITHATWIST and COPPER HALO and in a unanimous decision, disqualified BOURBONWITHATWIST from second to third for interference.

SLEW OF FASHION brushed with FIERA CANELA at the start, trailed to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and closed steadily
to win going away. WINNING APPEAL stalked the pace to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch then was no threat to the winner but bested the others.
JANERO ROSE broke a bit slow, hurried along inside rivals to contest the pace, saved ground and stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. GRAND SLAM
HOMERUN attended the pace outside rivals, was three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and also weakened. GRAZEN ROAD hustled and
dueled between rivals to mid turn, got outrun to mid stretch and tired. FIERA CANELA brushed with the winner at the start, had no speed then saved ground
and gave way.

Footnotes
BANDON BRIDGE was outrun to the turn, rallied three wide then shifted out into the stretch and finished in a steady rally to be along in time. CHIEFTESS
AINE hustled along early to duel two wide, responded to mid stretch, inched to the front nearing the sixteenth marker but could not stall the winner.
FICTIONAL chased the leaders two wide to the stretch, eased out in upper stretch but was outfinished by the top two. OKOYE dueled outside the runnerup,
was three wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then tired. DAISY FIELD had no speed, was three wide on the turn and not a factor. SHE'S
EXPENSIVE also had no speed and was always outrun. ARDTREA chased the pace from the rail to the stretch then stopped, was eased in mid stretch but
walked off after crossing the wire.

Footnotes
SHE'S A LIL FLIRT stalked the pace while off heels to the half mile pole, eased out and rallied three wide to the stretch then pushed to the front in mid
stretch and held determinedly. ROCKA DOCKA NOLA was outsprinted to the turn, got fanned four wide but rallied to mid stretch to loom a threat but was
outfinished by the winner. LIFE IN PARADISE set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded when collared in mid stretch then finished evenly in the
late stages. BINGOS SYSTEM chased the pace early, got outkicked on the turn and gave way in the stretch. GAMER BABZ hustled to prompt the pace
early, got outrun on the turn and stopped in the stretch.
