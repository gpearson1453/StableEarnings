DEWEY'S LITTLE JOE had a tight start, pressed the pace and proved the best late. LAUGHING LATINOS vied for the early advantage, drove clear, led
until late, couldn't match strides with the winner, but proved best of others. DOUBLE PRIORITY raced near the back in the beginning, had an outside trip,
proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. SLICK IT UP pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a finish. LIGHTNING
HARBOUR void of early speed, had a wide trip, improved position, but was no factor. TDZ WHAT A DREAM raced near the middle of the field and
weakened. COCO'S MAN raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. DIT always raced near the back and showed little. REMEMBER ME POP
raced in the middle of the field in the early part and dropped to the rear.

ADIOS CARLOS dueled for the early lead, saved ground, drove clear deep in the home stretch and proved the best. TAPPED TO THE MAX challenged for
the early advantage, dueled throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. GOLDENEYED raced in the back of the field in the
beginning, moved up and went to the wire evenly. PRIDEOFDIXIECREED vied for the early lead, saved ground and faded. FROSTED PRAYER void of
early speed, raced outside around the turn and was never a factor. KNIGHT'S HONOR pressed the early pace and retreated. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

match for the top two, but held on for third. SOUTHPINE GIFT raced near the back in the early part, showed late interest, but was no factor. KING ZIPPY
void of early speed, moved up, hung and was no threat late. SUCH always raced near the back, raced wide around the first turn and showed little.

wide, but was no factor. LUCKY INFERNO lacked early speed, saved ground around the final turn, made a bid, hung and was no threat late. SOCIAL
MISFIT drifted in at the start, raced near the middle of the pack, came around the final turn on the outside and finished evenly. ALEX'S TURN dueled for the
early lead, saved ground and faded. FLASHY IMAGE had a tight start, raced in the back and was never close. CAJUN PINATA showed early speed and
retreated to the rear.

ZIPZAPTIME went to the front, drove clear, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. THEBOYZHOUR raced in the middle of the field,
had an outside trip and finished willingly. BAYOU BODE lunged out, stumbled start, racing in the rear, gained ground late, but was no threat. SUMMER
APPEAL void of early speed, showed late interest, while racing wide around the final turn and was no threat. STEPPIN' OUTONHER raced near the middle
of the field, mild bid, weakened and was no factor. HE'S AN HONEST MAN pressed the early pace and faded. J S BACH raced evenly near the back and
showed little. WARNED raced within contention and stopped.
