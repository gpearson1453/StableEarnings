tracked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was carried five wide into the stretch, chased the winner on the outside under a drive,
gained in the final sixteenth and just missed while clear for the place. HAWK TAIL was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was carried
six wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. WINDCHILL ZAR broke out at the start, was carried in early then lost position while keen under
restraint between horses, went around the turn in the three path, was roused at the three-eighths turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the
needed response. F J'S GEM dropped back after the start, raced at the rear, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. RONNIE'S REASONING moved up while urged along on the inside, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. MISTER raced towards the

Footnotes
BLUEBIRD SING moved up after the start, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, inched clear under a right-handed whip in
upper stretch, switched to a left-handed whip while still on her inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. HEY GRACE broke very
fast and went clear early, was taken in hand and gave up the advantage, tracked the leading duo in two path through the turn, was asked into the stretch,
chased the winner in the drive and was out-kicked while clear for the place. DIAMOND AND SILKS moved up after the start, contested the pace on the
outside, went around the turn in the three path, began to drift out under a left-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths, continued to drift out into the final
sixteenth then was switched to a right-handed whip and weakened but was clear for the show. TIZ SUSAN ANN moved out while urged along off the pace,
chased four wide on the turn, floated five wide into the stretch, was carried out under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. NINE
LINE BIND was fractious in the gate, raced at the rear under urging, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. GIO'S LIL ANGEL was
ridden along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
STOP WAR broke out at the start then quickly moved clear, was taken in hand in the two path on the first turn, drew off to a sizable advantage on the
backstretch, remained well clear in the two path through the far turn, was asked at the three-sixteenths, came under a right-handed whip at the furlong
marker, shied out when switched to a left-handed whip at the sixteenth-pole, was straightened by the rider at that point then put to a hand ride before being
eased up in the final four strides while much the best. OFFSPRING broke out then was asked to get early position, rounded the first turn in the two path,
tugged hard at the bit under restraint entering the backstretch then settled on the outside, was hard ridden in the three path on the far turn, turned into the
stretch in the two path under a strong drive and safely secured the place. LUCKY FIND broke out then was hustled, went three wide on the first turn, was
coaxed along on the outside, dropped back while ridden along in the two path on the far turn and failed to respond. DECLARATIONWARRIOR was carried
out at the start, settled on the inside, dropped back leaving the backstretch and faltered.

Footnotes
UNANIMOUSLY was bumped soundly at the start and off a step slow, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged along in the three
path on the far turn, gained four wide into the stretch then was pulled out with a tug of the right-rein outside the furlong marker, rallied outside under a
left-handed whip and closed strongly to get up late. JANETS JAY JAY settled on the inside, lost action while too close to the rail early on the backstretch,
saved ground under urging early on the far turn, shifted four wide while gaining at the quarter-pole, rallied outside to take the lead at the furlong marker, led
under the whip into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. SCHNELL broke in and bumped soundly with the winner at the start, raced in
the two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked three wide on the far turn, gained passing the quarter-pole, reached a reasonable striking
position under a drive into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. HIGHLAND CREEK went around the first turn in the two path,
moved clear late on that bend, showed the way down the backstretch, extended the advantage while inside on the far turn, was asked at the
three-sixteenths then came under a drive, lost the advantage into the final furlong and tired. GALLANT STAR brushed with a foe at the start, showed speed
on the inside of a rival, raced along the rail on the first turn, tossed his head while taken back late on that bend, tracked the pace down the backstretch,
chased in the two path while hard ridden on the far turn and capitulated. WHOOSAH was taken back early, went three wide on the first turn, settled towards
the rear, saved ground on the far turn and was no factor. HENNING brushed with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside,
dropped back midway down the backstretch and retreated.
