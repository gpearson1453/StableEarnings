MARK WHATS MINE was outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide then swung out widest for the drive, responded when set down and closed fast to be
along in time. WHERE'S FRANKIE set the pace to the turn, turned back RUN THE BLUES AWAY into the stretch and inched away to mid stretch then dug
in but could not hold. TAKE HER TEMP was chasing to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then closed with a strong rally and just missed the place.
RUN THE BLUES AWAY pressed the leader to the turn, was two then three wide and loomed a threat at the quarter pole but got outkicked to mid stretch
and weakened. RACHEL'S LADY had no speed and saved ground to no avail. GARDEES WORLD stalked the pace to the turn, came three then four wide
to the stretch but tired in the final furlong.

SOUL PRODIGY had the best speed, set all the pace from the rail to the stretch then edged away under urging to mid stretch and held driving. TIME IS
GONE tracked the pace three wide to the stretch then finished willingly for the place. DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI pressed the winner while in the two path to the
stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and lacked the needed late response. TALISKER BAY was outsprinted to the turn then saved ground to the stretch but
could not make an impact in the drive. PRINCE ON THE RUN broke outward sharply then was corrected, had no speed, raced two wide on the turn then
swung out widest but did not rally.

Footnotes
HONEYMOONZ OVER had the best speed, set the pace off the rail, was three wide into the stretch, kicked away to mid stretch and held under steady
urging. CLEM LABINE had no speed, trailed to the turn, swung out four wide into the stretch and was gaining ground belatedly. SEQUENTIALLY got
bumped on both sides at the start, took up, was outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch and also was closing some late. CAPTURE THE SEA
broke inward, bumped SEQUENTIALLY, stalked the pace off the rail to the stretch then was outkicked by the winner to mid stretch and lacked the needed
response. HANDSOME GARY broke out, bumped SEQUENTIALLY, chased the winner from the rail to the stretch but tired through the drive.

Footnotes
RED BETTE was settled for a half mile, responded when roused into the second turn, circled four then five wide to the stretch then dug in determinedly to
wear down first GRAZEN ROAD then DON'T RUB IT. DON'T RUB IT stalked the pace to the second turn, rallied three to get on terms into the stretch then
battled GRAZEN ROAD to deep stretch, took a brief lead from that one but was nailed by the winner. GRAZEN ROAD pressed the pace three wide to the
half, bid two wide to duel for the lead to the stretch, stayed on stubbornly to deep stretch then was outkicked. PASSIONATE ROAD was chasing for five
furlongs, raced two then three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. BIG DRESS was allowed to settle to the second turn,
bid three wide then had to swing out five wide into the stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. DAISY FIELD had no speed, was three wide throughout
but never a threat. KRISTIN'S PICNIC hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail for five furlongs then was overtaken and tired. GOPREACHIT trailed
throughout.
