HYDROSTATIC chased inside of clear rival on the turn, asked for bid on the turn and overtook rival at the three sixteenths, entered stretch clear, and drew
off well under steady urging. PS BETTIN ON YOU cleared quickly and went to rail, entered turn clear, overtaken at the three sixteenths by HYDROSTATIC,
kept on in the stretch to hold place. HILL CROOME tracked leaders three wide on the backstretch, entered turn three wide and into the stretch in the three
path, bested rest while getting up for third. UNSTOPPABLE GUY tracked leaders along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn
and finished up evenly in the stretch. TIGER ON YOUR SIX tracked leaders in between rivals on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and lacked needed
kick in the lane. P TOWN TITAN settled along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the rail through the turn, angled out into the four path in the
stretch and made mild progress late. MO DINERO threw head and lost all chance at the start, not persevered with after such a tardy start and never
threatened.
