Footnotes
SHIMMER ME TIMBERS chased outside the leader in the two path, continued two wide through the turn, bid alongside the runner-up in mid-stretch and
drew clear in the final sixteenth. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES raced off the pace in the two path, angled out into the lane, rallied and got up for the place.
LOVE MY JIMMY broke in and bumped rival, sped to the front and crossed over to the rail, remained unchallenged into the stretch, held a short lead past
the eighth pole, could not match the winner late and lost the place. PAPPY BOYINGTON broke in a bit at the start, stalked along the inside, cut the corner
into the drive and lacked a necessary bid. SENSEMAKER chased four deep or four wide early, angled in a few paths on the turn, shifted to the rail in upper
stretch and went evenly through the final furlong. GATES OF HEAVEN broke out and bumped rival, chased three wide between rivals up the backstretch,
took the turn three wide and weakened. JUST A COMMAND got bumped from both sides in the beginning, entered the turn three wide then came out into
the drive and made no impact. ME LIKEY chased five wide or five deep to the turn, entered the lane three to four wide and faded.

Footnotes
HAPPIER set the pace with MISS FIA to the outside, dueled with at rival around the bend, kicked clear at the top of the lane and was kept to task through
the final furlong. PHAROAH'S HEART settled off the rail or outside a rival, went two wide around the bend, chased the winner to the wire and was clearly
second best. MISS FIA prompted the pace from outside, dueled with the winner through the turn, could not kick on at the top of the lane, exchanged bumps
with ANNA FANTASTIC in the lane and finished willingly to hold the show. ANNA FANTASTIC stalked outside the top pair, went three wide around the
bend, chased outside MISS FIA and exchanged bumps with that rival in the lane and could not get by for the show. PAID INFORMANT traveled along the
inside while in range, angled out into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
ABSOLUTE UNIT stalked outside a rival, headed the leader at the eighth pole and inched away in the late stages. ASTRONAUT steadied on the first turn,
chased behind the leader from inside to the stretch, angled out near the eighth pole, summoned a late bid and earned the place. STILL IN THE GAME broke
a bit slow then sped to the front, cleared the field and angled to the inside, showed the way into the stretch, urged right-handed in the lane and was
outfinished by the top pair. COSMO raced three wide into the first turn, tracked the pace outside a rival or two wide, came three wide into the stretch and
kept on for a minor award. CAPITAL CALL forced in by rival at the start, tracked along the inside then a bit off the rail into the stretch, lacked room behind a
pair of rivals and angled out at the eighth pole, then improved position. WARAIRE broke inward leaving the gate, was rank through the first turn, chased two
wide into the drive and lacked further response. PHANTOM DANCE was off a bit slow to begin, steadied inside on the first turn, went two wide and outside a
rival into the far turn, remained in the two path to the stretch and was never a factor. OCULUS steadied off heels on the first turn, chased inside to the
stretch and weakened. ON EASY STREET reserved early from inside, angled out on the second turn and came three wide into the stretch but failed
threaten. INFATUATE settled off the speed in the two path, moved out three wide on the backstretch, angled in around the final bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
ROYAL BLEND showed early speed between rivals then dropped back a bit into a stalking position, raced along the inside into the turn, angled three wide
around the bend, tipped out at the top of the stretch, surged clear at the eighth pole and was ridden out in deep stretch. CONSIDER ME GONE dropped
back early, saved ground along the inside to the stretch, steered out with a furlong to go and rallied for the place. CIRCLE OF HONOR vied three deep then
between rivals on the backstretch, lost a bit of ground to the leader early on the turn, then came again to challenge between rivals past the quarter pole,
challenged for command in upper stretch then proved no match for the winner and lost the place. PURDA VITA vied early from inside, inched ahead of rivals
on the turn then met challengers again at the quarter pole, fought to the eighth pole and flattened out in the final furlong. SWEET MEG lacked early speed,
raced widest early then angled in leaving the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch and passed tired rivals. TRIBAL BID had early speed outside a
quartet of rivals, dropped back to chased the top trio four then three wide around the turn and weakened. KINGS TABLE was shuffled back between rivals
soon after the start, sat off the pace early, went three wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and never threatened. FAITHMEISTER showed early
speed four deep then three deep to the turn, lost ground around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
LIBERAL (IRE) reserved in the early going and angled in, closed in through the far turn while angling out, moved out further in upper stretch then rallied and
got up late. SEEKING REFUGE was mid-pack through the early going, came four wide into the lane, bid upper stretch and was bested by the winner. DR.
TROUTMAN sped to the front from the far outside, steered inward once clear, dueled around the far turn losing command past the five-sixteenths, continued
to fight on into the stretch, regained command at the eighth pole but was outkicked by the top pair. HONOS MAN settled near mid-pack from inside, took
closer order leaving the backstretch, traveled two wide into the drive and finished willingly. MANTRA raced near the back of the field near the inside, angled
out on the second turn then steered out widest in the lane, had the rider lose his stick mid-stretch and finished with mild response to hand urging. SKY
CONFIDENTIAL forwardly placed early behind the leader along the inside, saved ground to the stretch and never produced a bid. SLY was up close early
outside a rival, bid alongside the leader into the turn, took a short past the five-sixteenths pole, lost command in upper stretch and weakened late. JUSTIN'S
QUEST stalked two wide, closed in up the backstretch, went outside a rival into the turn, came three wide into the stretch and flattened. M TOWN GEM
trailed the field early, lacked room behind rivals nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled out into the stretch and never rallied. TROMADOR raced off the
pace outside a rival, moved out four wide on the backstretch, stayed four wide into the far turn then moved into the three path around the bend and faded.

Footnotes
INSTASTORY dueled outside of SUGAR MOON for command, vied between rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, held a short lead over WICKS AND
CHAPPIES in the final furlong and gamely prevailed. WICKS AND CHAPPIES raced outside the top pair, vied three deep midway around the turn, dueled
outside of INSTASTORY through the furlong grounds and could not summon the needed late kick. SUGAR MOON dueled with INSTASTORY up the
backstretch, vied with outside pair to the stretch and gave way approaching the eighth pole. PARTYATTHECAPITAL chased along the rail and never found
the needed response. BADGER GAL tracked three wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. MY GIRL PEARL sat off the pace,
steadied briefly inside rival at the five-sixteenths pole, angled in some leaving the bend and proved no menace. HARU'S STAR chased outside a rival to the
turn, angled four wide into the stretch and weakened. RAY RAY IS GONE raced at the back of the field outside a rival, took the turn five wide and was never
a factor.

Footnotes
GOING GLOBAL (IRE) settled off the pace from inside, saved ground then shifted two wide at the top of the lane, angled out approaching the eighth pole,
surged late and got up. FIVE PICS PLEASE sped clear and took control of the rail, showed the way clear into and around the turn, remained unchallenged
to the sixteenth pole and got nailed in the closing moments. NIMBOSTRATUS (FR) was in range early from inside, cut the corner into the stretch, tipped out
and finished willingly for a game third. MAJESTIC STEPS (IRE) tracked outside a rival, checked off heels twice on the turn, angled to the inside and bested
the rest. SQUARED SHADY bumped from outside at the start, raced off the rail then angled to the inside, swung four wide into the stretch and finished
evenly. I'M SO ANNA chased three wide and outside a rival, stayed in the three path into the stretch and flattened. PLUM SEXY lacked early speed, angled
to the inside, came out into the stretch and showed a mild response to pass tired rivals. FREEDOM FLYER stalked behind the leader in the two path, took
aim two wide into the stretch and weakened. ROYAL ADDRESS (IRE) broke in and bumped rival, angled out around the turn, chased four wide into the
stretch, came out at the eighth pole and flattened. MAGICAL THOUGHT angled in early, saved ground to the stretch and proved no menace. GO GRETA
(GB) jumped the track crossing over surfaces early, angled out then back in at the quarter pole and had little left. PIZZAZZ stalked the pace in the two path,
took a bad step early on the turn, drifted out around the bend, was steered out into the stretch, eased to the wire and walked off.

UNO TROUBLE MAKER vied for the lead from inside then cleared at the half-mile pole, met bid from outside around the turn, dueled with the runner-up in
the stretch, lost lead inside the furlong grounds then dug in late and edged BRILLIAN BIRD in the closing moments. BRILLIANT BIRD vied four deep early
then chased the leader to the turn, drew alongside around the bend and dueled into and down the stretch, took a short lead mid-stretch but got outgamed in
the final strides. JEWEL THIEF had early speed between rivals then dropped back to chase, took the turn three wide and gained ground on the top pair in
deep stretch. DORITA'S LEMON chased from inside off the pace, angled out entering the stretch and kept on for a minor share. ZILLINDA settled off the
inside, went three wide into the turn, angled in at the top of the lane and failed to rally. GIRONA had early speed then chased the lone leader two wide
through the turn and weakened. TODOS SANTOS went five wide into the bend, four wide entering the stretch and never threatened. SYBIL'S KITTY broke
a bit but was quickly corrected, went four wide through the turn and never made an impact. SHERILINDA took the turn two wide and came up empty.

runner-up. CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS sped clear early, opened up on the backstretch, showed the way into the drive, led clear to the sixteenth pole, was
reeled in by the winner and lasted for second. WARRENS CANDY MAN broke out and bumped rival, tracked off the rail or outside a rival, came three wide
into the lane and missed the place. BUKAYO closest in pursuit early, closed in leaving the final turn, angled outside the leader but lacked the needed late
punch. BLUE STAR went three wide into the clubhouse turn, two wide into the stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong. BIG FRANK DA TANK settled
inside on the first turn then moved out on the backstretch, went three wide around the far turn and lacked the needed late kick in deep stretch. GORDY'S
BOY stalked the pace from inside, steadied near the three-eighths pole, remained inside to the stretch and could not rally. J C EXPRESS broke out and hit
the outside part of the gate, traveled off the inside then angled in on the far turn and made no impact. MENSA ON TAP broke slow and lost her path at the
start, trailed through the early stages and never got involved. BIG FLINT broke in and bumped rival in the beginning, was eased on the second turn, coasted
through the stretch and walked off.
