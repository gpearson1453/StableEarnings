Footnotes
RAELYN'S STAR stalked early while between horses, started a three wide bid approaching the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage
still two deep on the far turn, then dug in under determined handling to best Castleinthemeadow while holding off the later arrival of NORTHERN HEAT, who
rounded the first turn in the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, closed toward contention nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced at a close
disadvantage three wide on the far turn, drifted into the stretch but dug in under steady encouragement to take second under the wire.
CASTLEINTHEMEADOW raced with the pace while mostly maintaining a slight advantage, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and kept
the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dueled gamely through the stretch but gave up the nod to the winner late and was nipped from second under the
wire. CHARITABLE ROSE rated close inside then bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, was eased out in the upper stretch and
finished well to gain on the top three. WHIZ PASS settled back off the rail the first turn then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, came through the far
turn about the four path, though, weakened. PROCIDANA raced with the pace while taking a brief lead between poles, gave chase leaving the three eighths
pole but dropped back at the five sixteenths and faded at the rail.

PRIMAL DESTINY was hustled along to set a pressured pace and contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, then dug in under steady stretch
encouragement to hold on. SOUL MACHEN chased the early pace outside, raced in the three path of the turn, drifted into the stretch but dug in when
straightened away and was gaining late on the winner. SWISS SUNRISE chased toward the outside and rounded the turn about the three path, drifted a bit
into the stretch but finished well. RULING pressured the pace through the backstretch and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, but
dropped back leaving the eighth pole and flattened in the lane. BOUNDTOBEGOOD gave chase off the rail and raced two deep on the turn, then finished
evenly. KUCHEROV broke through the gate prior the start, picked up the chase toward the inside, rounded the turn near the rail then flattened the final
sixteenth. A POWERFUL TALE gave chase and raced in the five path of the turn.

Footnotes
WONDER CHARM tapered to the inside to set a clear early pace, was pressured past the three eighths pole and met at even terms at the five sixteenths,
contested the rail on the turn then dug in under determined handling to hold on. HURRICANE DIRECTOR chased off the rail and took aim three wide
midway on the turn, dug in gamely leaving the turn, though, was outfinished. COLETTE'S SPIRIT exchanged contact with Easy's Final Rose leaving the
gate then picked up the chase outside, rounded the turn near the rail then dueled to take third inside the sixteenth pole. CHROMATIC pressured the pace
past the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms from the five sixteenths, contested with a slim advantage two deep on the turn, dropped back between
horses into the lane and flattened stride the final sixteenth. EASY'S FINAL ROSE exchanged contact with Colette's Spirit leaving the gate and was steadied
through the chute, picked up the chase then raced at the rail on the turn and showed little more. AWESOME BUTTERFLY gave chase toward the outside
and rounded the turn about the six path.
