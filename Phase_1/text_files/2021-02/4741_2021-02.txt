Footnotes
IZZADORA BELLA vied inside a rival for the lead, shook free on the far turn, raced off the rail, drifted in, in front of LOLANITA at the eighth pole, then held
well under urging. LOLANITA raced two wide off the pace, moved up inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail, altered course behind the winner past the
furlong marker and rallied outside. GALILEO'S AFFAIR raced off the pace inside, advanced at the quarter pole and rallied mildly for third. WHAT ABOUT
TONIGHT vied outside for the lead, chased on the far turn and weakened in the lane. PENANCE reluctant to load, raced three wide early, then stalked,
chased on the far turn and tired. PARTY IN THE SAND was outrun early and did not factor. TOWSON was rank early and stumbled badly entering the first
turn, dropped far back, was pulled up on the far turn and walked off.

TRULY A MOON SHOT stalked close up outside, bid three wide midway on the turn, rallied to the front in upper stretch and drew clear under urging. THE
ITALIAN dueled inside for the lead, battled with HUYA on the turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch run and held on for second. SUNRISE SATURDAY
chased outside, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly. REFUSEING was outrun early and closed belatedly inside. FREIBURG bobbled at the break
and was off slowly, raced between rivals at the quarter pole and lacked a rally. DROSSELMAGIC was reluctant to load, then chased inside and lacked a
rally. ADULATION raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. HUYA dueled two wide for the lead, dueled on the turn and faded. BOBCAT chased
two wide and faded.

Footnotes
I'AM A UNICORN pursued the loose pacesetter outside, took over into the stretch then edged clear driving. CARMELTINI broke sluggishly, saved ground to
the stretch and closed well too late. PASATIME saved ground within striking range then flattened out in the final furlong. MADELYN'S DANCER chased
inside and continued well while no threat. TAYLOR'S BELLE trailed for half a mile then passed fading rivals. DONA CAMILE settled outside in the second
flight and faded after half a mile. WISES LANDING lacked speed and was always outrun. RUNNING GIRL stumbled while breaking alertly, opened a big
lead, then proved empty in the stretch. FOUR SEASONS GIRL chased in mid pack and gave way readily. BETTER BEGIN dropped back early and
weakened steadily.

OFF DUTY controlled the pace, drifted out in the stretch and lasted drifted out driving. LOVERBOY LOU raced close up inside, angled out in the stretch and
made a gradual gain. BANG THE DRUM advanced in the two path on the turn and closed well. JONES TAXI lagged far behind then closed gap along the
inside. DELINQUENT lagged far behind then showed some late energy. BOLITA BOYZ chased outside off the pace and lacked a rally. TRUSTING FRIEND
broke slowest and was never in contention. FIFTY saved ground and was never a factor. SAMADI SKY chased close up three wide to the stretch and gave
way. VERY COLORFUL prompted the pace and stopped.

MARKET MAVEN set a pressured pace inside, shook loose after the half and drew away while kept to steady encouragement. BOURBONIC trailed early,
advanced outside and finished well while no threat. SMOKUM PEACE PIPE prompted the winner outside and continued willingly to the finish. TOO BOSS
chased wide throughout, made a brief bid after the half then flattened out. SCOTCH ROCK'S saved ground early then dropped back and was never in
contention. SPIRIT WOLF chased along the inside and stopped abruptly. FOXBOROUGH was very unruly and injured himself in the starting gate delaying
the start and was ordered scratched by the stewards on the advice of the track veterinarian.
