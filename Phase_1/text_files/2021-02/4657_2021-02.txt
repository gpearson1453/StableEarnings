Footnotes
MONEY SONG broke outwards bumping RAL COPPERHEAD, was righted to gain the advantage in the opening stages, was headed between calls while
prompting the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, dispatched that foe while shifting to the three path in upper stretch and went clear under pressure.
OUR GREY GHOST, off slowly, then bumped at the start, settled out of striking distance along the inside, angled out five wide racing into upper stretch and
found his best stride in the closing stages to prevail for the place honors. BLACK V. K. tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, was
fanned six wide into upper stretch but continued willingly while just outkicked for second. RAL COPPERHEADROAD, bumped by the eventual winner at the
start while forced into the path of FLIPPING FUN, was righted to track just off the first flight in early stages, lost some position racing into the turn but
continued evenly between rivals to late stages. FLIPPING FUN, bumped at the start, tracked off the first flight four wide on the backstretch, continued in
pursuit of the leaders on the turn but faded between rivals in late stages. JUMP BACK JACK broke inwards bumping OUR GREY GHOST, was quickly
righted, then urged along the rail pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, couldn't match the winner in upper stretch and gave way late.
THREE BALL dropped out early.

Footnotes
FLASHING DIAMOND was settled between foes in the opening stages, shifted inwards nearing the turn steadily gaining position just off the inside racing to
upper stretch, shifted out three wide nearing the furlong marker and responded to firm left handed pressure to wrest the advantage and go clear in time.
NOTHINS FREE angled to the inside in the opening stages while being urged to press the pace racing into the turn, dueled into upper stretch and edged a
rival for the place honors late while failing to contain the winner. R NEXT ROLL broke sharply to gain the advantage, disputed the pace outside a rival racing
into the turn, pressed the issue to midstretch and yielded between foes nearing the wire. LEDECKY settled last in the opening stages, angled to the rail,
saved ground to upper stretch and steadily improved his position. BERBERSLILBRIEBRIE tracked off the first flight near the inside racing to the turn, then
continued evenly between foes into the stretch. BURKEY'S BABE, forwardly placed three wide stalking just off the first flight racing into the turn, faded
nearing midstretch. NERVE LINE settled outside foes in early stages and never mounted a serious challenge.

Footnotes
LEGACY AZTECA, forwardly placed four wide in the opening stages, was prompted to make a steady advance on the leaders three wide racing into the
turn, wrested the advantage nearing upper stretch and held sway through the lane under firm right handed encouragement. GOLD WING tracked outside
the first flight in the opening stages, shifted in on the turn making steady progress three wide to upper stretch, moved to close the gap on the winner late but
was always only second best. CALL ME HANDSOME, urged disputing the pace inside rivals shifting a bit off the rail racing through the backstretch into the
turn, couldn't match the winner after a half, continued in pursuit of that rival to the lane but gave way in late stages. MULLED WINE settled outside foes in
the opening stages, then split rivals on the turn to improve his position between foes with a belated effort. GETTININTOMISCHIEF vied between foes racing
into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. ROLLER settled between foes in the opening stages, shifted out four wide on the turn while making some brief
progress but lacked the needed closing response. FIVE STAR CREEK, roused to terms with the leaders three deep between foes in the opening quarter,
gave way early. OSKAR BLUES angled to the inside early tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance but faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
PRIZED WARRIOR broke readily, attended the pace between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to go clear racing into the far turn, shifted out to
the three path racing into upper stretch and repelled several challengers racing through the stretch to prevail on a safe margin under firm left handed
encouragement. SILENT MISCHIEF bobbled at the start, settled inside rivals racing to the backstretch, shifted out midway through the backstretch steadily
gaining position between foes racing into the far turn, angled to the rail advancing inside the pacesetter to challenge that foe nearing midstretch but was
outkicked while prevailing narrowly for the place honors. SILVER EDGE was rated off the first flight racing outside a rival to the backstretch, was prompted
to split foes three wide racing into the far turn advancing on the pacesetter, shifted inwards nearing the lane to bid for command between rivals midstretch
but was outkicked by the top pair. PREQUALIFIED tracked off the first flight along the rail to the backstretch, was held up momentarily when caught in tight
quarters racing past the seven sixteenths marker, saved ground on the turn, then angled out to three path in the closing stages while finishing evenly.
COGAN, reserved between in the last flight racing to the backstretch, dropped back to last racing into the far turn and passed only tiring rivals. FREE
FLAYME broke readily, was urged to a forward placing three wide racing to the backstretch, lodged a brief bid outside the eventual winner racing into the far
turn but emptied out early. NEAT STREET settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and never mounted a serious challenge. HOME IT
TIZ, urged to the lead along the inside racing into the first turn, set the pace to the second bend and abruptly gave out.

FAN FAN joined the pace four wide in the opening stages, moved to press the issue three deep entering the turn, gained the advantage nearing upper
stretch, shifted inwards once gaining a clear advantage entering the lane, extended the advantage under firm left handed pressure and was taken in hand
nearing the wire once the issue was decided. FLASH TOWN, urged inside foes prompting the pace through the backstretch, continued along the inside
tracking just inside the leaders into upper stretch and proved best of the others in the drive. GONE TO CABO, urged to the lead between foes dictating the
pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn, gave way once headed by the winner racing into upper stretch. MI CLEOPATRA AND I broke outwards
appearing to brush the gate, raced in touch with the field three deep between foes in the opening quarter, lost some position while shifting out four wide
racing into the turn and soon gave way.

Footnotes
ATLANTIC PRINCESS tracked the leaders from just out of striking distance along the inside racing into the first turn, shifted out three wide midway through
the backstretch steadily advancing on the leaders, took over racing into the far turn and steadily widened her advantage under pressure. WILL TAKE
ROSES tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, advanced on the pacesetter racing four wide into the far turn, couldn't close the gap
on that foe in the drive but prevailed for the place honors. ALEX'S FIRST settled off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, split foes three
deep nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. RUBY LEE tracked off the second flight while shifting out five wide on the
backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path through the far turn to upper stretch and was just outkicked for a share. SEE ME SEE YOU, caught four
wide in the opening stages, angled inwards racing to the backstretch forcing the pace outside a rival in the opening half but gave way between foes racing
into upper stretch. BABY BEE MERRY, off last, settled off rivals racing to the first turn, shifted out four wide nearing the second bend but offered no rally.
CHARLITA worked her way to the inside in early stages dropping off the second flight, saved ground to the lane but had no closing bid. DONYA'S MAGIC,
urged between foes to dispute the lead racing into the first turn, angled to the inside nearing the backstretch dueling for command inside a rival but gave
way entering the far turn. BEAUTY GENIUS dropped out last while racing widest to the backstretch and never menaced thereafter. DREAMS STILL WILD,
urged inside foes to gain a forward placing racing into the first turn, shifted out racing into the backstretch but abruptly gave way between foes midway
through the backstretch.

Footnotes
YEUDIEL was settled off the second flight racing outside rivals in the opening quarter, steadily advanced on the leaders racing four wide through the turn to
upper stretch and continued under steady pressure to prevail in time. ON DUTY, urged to the lead racing through the backstretch while a bit off the rail,
dueled for command inside a rival, then between foes into the stretch but continued with a grudging effort to prevail narrowly for second. WHO IS JARETT,
forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, bid for command along the rail when presented an opening in upper stretch, pressed the
issue to late stages but was outkicked by the top pair. PACHI, forwardly placed three wide prompting the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, pressed
the issue racing into the turn, continued three deep between foes to midstretch but weakened late. NELSON LEGEND tracked off the first flight outside foes
racing to the turn, was urged to advance three deep between foes while caught in close quarters racing into the stretch and faded in the closing stages.
GARNETT, slow to gather stride, then a bit outpaced racing along the inside to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and split rivals in late stages to gain
some position while never proving a serious threat. IFEELGOOD tracked the pace between foes in second flight but faded early. SMART SOLDIER angled
to the inside tracking off the second flight in the opening quarter, shifted out four wide racing through the turn but lacked a closing bd. E B'S WIRTHIT broke
slowly dropping well off the field and proved no threat. EL SOLO UNO angled to the inside early tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, saved
ground to the lane and gave way in upper stretch. ZUMWALT dropped out early.

Footnotes
BABY BOOMER was urged to gain terms with a rival prompting the pace racing through the backstretch, edged forward to a narrow advantage between
foes nearing upper stretch and came under brisk handling to edge clear approaching the wire. COMPANY STORE was urged to the lead just off the inside
disputing the pace in the opening stages, pressed the issue inside the eventual winner racing into upper stretch but came up second best. BOOYAKASHA
tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, angled four wide nearing upper stretch and continued well enough to edge a rival for a share.
FRONTIER MESA, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn, was urged to lodge a brief bid in that path nearing upper
stretch but flattened out racing through the lane. LARGE, bumped soundly, then forced into UNION APPRECIATION at the start, settled off the second flight
racing off the inside to the turn but never gained contention. STOPIT swerved out at the start bumping LARGE soundly, was collected to track off the first
flight while angling to the inside racing to the turn but steadily faded into the stretch. UNION APPRECIATION, bumped, then forced out at the start, trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
NORA RADD hopped slightly at the start but recovered quickly to gain terms with the leaders while angling inwards to press the pace outside a rival racing
into the bend, shook clear midway through the turn remaining off the rail and steadily widened her advantage to the end under firm handling. CHERRY
ROCK BRIDGE, a step slow into stride, saved ground while being prompted to advance inside foes racing into the turn, came through close quarters
entering the lane and edged a rival for the place honors in late stages. BY MY OWN broke readily, was held up momentarily avoiding close quarters in the
opening sixteenth, switched out three wide while being prompted in pursuit of the leader between foes racing into the lane and just missed for the place
honors. THATS ALL SHEWROTE settled inside foes in the last flight racing to the turn, split rivals just off the inside entering stretch and continued with a
steady effort to gain some position. BILL'S BEAUTY tracked just off the first flight between foes just off the inside racing to the turn, angled out four wide
entering the lane but lacked the needed late bid. FLORESITA, caught in tight quarters at the start, angled to the inside racing through the backstretch and
passed inside tiring rivals entering the lane. MY LITTLE PRETTY tracked off the first flight racing four wide between foes, shifted in to make brief progress
three wide on the turn but came up empty in upper stretch. CROSS THE MERSEY was off slowly, then was caught wide throughout while proving no threat.
LET'S GO MAYA, caught in tight quarters at the start, faded between foes early. INERTIA, caught five wide tracking off the second flight on the backstretch,
soon retreated. VIRGINIA DOZE, urged to dispute the pace inside the eventual winner racing into the turn, gave way abruptly racing into upper stretch.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF BY MY OWN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ON THE
BACKSTRETCH WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.
