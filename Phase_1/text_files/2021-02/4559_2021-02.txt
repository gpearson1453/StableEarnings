CAUSE I SAID was content to lag outside, rallied well out into the track around the turn, took over after five furlongs and drove clear. SWEET MESA raced
inside the winner early, rallied two wide around the turn, steadied, angled to the outside for room in early stretch and finished fastest. TAK E LADY made a
run in the four path around the turn, moved to a short lived lead between rivals before five furlongs then gave way. TINDER DATE was unhurried, raced the
four path around the turn, split rivals into the final sixteenth and finished willingly. COME ON LET'S RIDE came out into the three path on the turn and
lacked a strong closing. MARTHA'S MISCHIEF moved to a short lead along the inside midway on the backstretch, remained prominent into the stretch then
weakened. MADE TO HUSTLE broke sharply for the early lead, raced two wide around the turn and faded through the lane. SAILOR'S SALUTE stopped
inside. Half mile time unavailable due to a teletimer malfunction.

Footnotes
TIZ PROMISING RVF was content to lag following a slow break, raced four wide around the turn, closed outside and was along in time. ALL ABOUT
REYANA steadied behind a foe entering the turn, came out two wide, rallied to a short lead in late stretch but couldn't last. CALS MY PAL was slow early,
circled into the stretch, closed inside the winner through the lane and the rider stood up before the wire. MAD MOMMA opened a clear lead soon after the
break, saved ground around the turn then gave way after five furlongs. STORMY SPELL broke slowly, advanced outside early, raced three wide around the
turn, remained in good position into the final furlong then weakened. MUSICAL TIMES was close up between rivals early, angled to the inside on the turn
and tired. VANESSA'S SECRET chased early, moved outside the early leader on the turn then tired in the lane. LADY JOANNA stopped inside. FOXY'S
EDGE stopped and was eased up through the lane.

AIN'T MISBEHAVIN settled inside, came out between horses for the drive and was along in time. SECURITY BREACH was rated in good position, raced
the four path around the final turn, moved to a short lead leaving the furlong grounds but couldn't last. STARRY SKY lagged inside, angled out on the final
turn, swung wide into the stretch and closed willingly outside. CUTTER HELM stayed out from the rail while chasing the early leader, moved to a short lead
approaching the lane then faded in the drive. MICKEY T was hustled to a clear lead before going a furlong, angled to the rail on the first turn and tired in the
lane. CHUCKLES was caught four wide around the first turn and failed to menace. SKYWRITING stopped in the lane and was eased up.

clear lead before going a furlong, stayed along the inside while making the pace for over five furlongs then weakened. A MAIZE ZING RIP was slow early,
raced two wide around the turn and gained late between horses. THATWOULDBEGRAND wasn't far back in the three path to the stretch then weakened.
BRIDOLOGIST hit the inside of the gate, ducked in sharply while breaking several lengths behind the field and never caught up. ATTHEPEARLYGATES

Footnotes
INSPIRED GEM was hustled to a clear lead before going a furlong, stayed close to the inside and was kept to task. NEARLY MISSED advanced the two
path on the turn and continued evenly through the lane. TRULY FUNNY chased early in the three path then tired. LIL SURVIVOR was slow early then
gained mildly between rivals. MIA ANGELINA was slow early, raced wide around the turn and passed tired ones. FOXY HIYA stopped inside on the turn.
TOO MUCH DRAMA advanced wide on the turn then stopped. PABLO'S DREAM broke slowly then was wide and outrun. EXPRESSFUL GRACE stopped
inside. MUNNY CALL was finished early.
