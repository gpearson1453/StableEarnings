Footnotes
LA CHICA LATERAL exchanged light contact at the start with R AVERIE LYNN, was collected, then urged to the lead along the inside dictating the pace on
a narrow margin racing into the turn, went clear nearing upper stretch and steadily extended the advantage under hand urging while her rider flashed the
whip left handed. R AVERIE LYNN exchanged a bump at the start with the eventual winner, was urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn,
couldn't maintain terms with that rival but held grudgingly for second. MELANCHOLY BLUES, a bit outpaced in the opening stages racing nearest the inside
to the turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch and displayed some late interest to improve her position. HIGHTIME VALENTINE drifted out at the start into
the path of SAY CHEESE, was settled off the first flight while angling inwards racing through the backstretch, then split foes just off the inside racing into
upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. PEACEFUL WAY, urged three deep between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, gave way nearing
midstretch. SAY CHEESE, carried out a bit at the start, was urged to gain a forward placing just off the pacesetter racing four wide to the turn and steadily
faded nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
DELAWARE DESTROYER was rated off the first flight while angling to the inside leaving the chute, shifted out on the far turn to bid for command three
deep nearing upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and went clear under firm right handed pressure. QUANTUM VELOCITY, reserved in last along the
inside racing to the backstretch, tracked off the second flight to the far turn, then saved ground to upper stretch and made steady late progress to prevail for
the place honors. HIGHLY NOTED ducked out at the start, was urged clear while angling to the inside leaving the chute, set the pace into the backstretch,
dueled inside a rival through the far turn and gave way leaving midstretch. KICK IT CHARLIE, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening
half, advanced to press the issue on the far turn to strike the front nearing upper stretch, shifted out once losing the advantage to the eventual winner and
quickly emptied out. HANDSOME EFFORT settled between foes in the last flight early, tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the far turn and
offered no rally. FORMAL TREASURE shifted out three wide racing as part of the last flight to the backstretch, was prompted to gain a position outside a
rival in second flight after a half but steadily faded racing into the lane.

Footnotes
WILLIAM CROTTY tracked just off the first flight outside a rival under light rating racing to the backstretch, shifted three deep nearing upper stretch while
advancing to challenge for command, contested the issue past midstretch and edged clear late under firm encouragement. TIP SHEET, in touch attending a
rival's pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the between foes to gain the advantage after six furlongs, resisted the winner's bid to late stages but proved
only second best. IRISH VALOR tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the far turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and continued with
interest while being just outkicked for the place honors. DAKOTA'S DUDE sped to the lead while angling inwards, dictated the pace on a narrow margin a bit
off the rail racing to the second bend, dueled for command inside foes to upper stretch but weakened late. THANK YOU tracked off the second flight
between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the lane but offered no rally. PAINTER'S PRIDE settled three wide in the last flight
racing to the backstretch but failed to produce a closing response. BOXER BOY ducked inwards at the start, was righted to track off the second flight along
the inside racing to the far turn, steadily faded nearing the lane and was reported to be vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
BATTLE RAGS broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage racing in the three path in the opening stages, dueled for command remaining off
the rail racing through the turn, repelled a rival in upper stretch and went clear late under firm encouragement. SOUL REFLECTION, held up avoiding close
quarters just after the start, was prompted to split foes three deep nearing the lane, angled to the four path midstretch and continued with a steady bid to
prevail for the place honors. FLYING BANKROLL, urged to prompt the pacesetter along the inside in the opening stages, switched outside the leader on the
turn while advancing to press the pace, dueled to upper stretch but proved no match late. FLASH IT, pulling between foes in close quarters in the opening
stages, angled to the rail while prompted in pursuit of the leaders racing into the turn and continued with interest inside rivals while just outkicked for a share.
SEATTLE COUNCIL, forwardly placed three wide pursuing the pacesetter, faded between foes racing into upper stretch. PAPA RALPH J, caught five wide
racing to the turn, never seriously menaced. COUSIN angled to the inside early but soon dropped out. RICKY RUN tracked off the second flight racing four
wide between foes into the turn, steadily faded into the lane, was gathered up nearing the wire, then was vanned off the course when failing to return to be
unsaddled.

Footnotes
QUICK ENTRY, forwardly placed three wide prompting the pace racing to the turn, pressed the issue in that path into upper stretch and just held the late
challenge of STRIKING HEIR to the end under firm right handed pressure. The latter was rated just off the first flight between foes racing into the bend,
briefly awaited an opening while shifting to the three path approaching upper stretch, shifted out four wide entering the lane while being roused to advance
and continued willingly to the end to challenge for command approaching the wire. NATIVE HAWK, urged to a forward placing along the rail tracking just
inside the pacesetter, was prompted to press inside rivals racing into upper stretch and continued with interest while just outkicked by the top pair. SKOLE,
urged between foes dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong
marker. SMART WARRIOR tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the turn but offered no closing bid. BEYOND STREETSMART tracked off the first
flight along the inside but faded early.

Footnotes
VAN angled to the rail in early stages stalking just off the pacesetter, switched out nearing the far turn while moving to prompt the issue, dueled for
command into upper stretch and went clear late under firm left handed encouragement. DYNABLUE, caught in close quarters, then shuffled back at the
start, was reserved between foes to the backstretch, swung outside foes on the far turn, steadily advanced five wide into upper stretch and prevailed for the
place honors while failing to gain even terms with the winner. SEARCHING FOR GOLD, reserved along the inside, then steadied momentarily nearest the
rail entering the first turn, continued last to the far turn, shifted out splitting foes nearing upper stretch, then angled six wide racing past the furlong marker
while finishing well in a belated rally. KING RAMOS moved to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the
far turn, dueled inside the winner to midstretch but yielded late. ALKI BEACH, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the leaders to the backstretch,
was prompted to challenge in that path nearing upper stretch, shifted inwards under pressure and steadily faded late. PRIVATE CODE tracked off the
second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, angled inwards on the far turn and steadily faded. MISSION BRIEF, caught four wide tracking off the
second flight leaving the chute, shifted inwards entering the backstretch to track between rivals, shifted out five wide entering upper stretch but had no
closing bid. CENTSOFWANDER, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, faded after a half. TEXAS STORM broke inwards
crossing the path of DYANBLUE at the start, was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch but came up empty racing
into the far turn.

Footnotes
TITHED angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, shifted out three wide nearing the lane steadily advancing to challenge,
wrested the advantage in upper stretch and went clear under firm right handed pressure. COURAGEOUS CRAFT came through some traffic at the break to
track off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch, couldn't menace the winner but proved best of the others.
PAPA LUKE ducked out at the start, was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, gained a brief advantage nearing upper stretch but gave
out once headed by the winner. YEUDIEL shied outwards avoiding PAPA LUKE at the start while shifting into the path of MARK ME, was righted to track off
the second flight between foes racing to the turn and continued evenly to late stages. PACHI was hustled to the lead along the rail in the opening stages,
dueled for command racing into the turn and gave way early. JUPI'SRESURRECTION tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn but
offered no rally. MARK ME dislodged his rider and ran loose momentarily before the start, was knocked back out of tight quarters at the start, then failed to
menace thereafter. SEWEL ducked into the gap along the rail at the start, was checked while his rider corrected his course dropping well off the field and
failed to menace thereafter. WHY NOT A WARRIOR proved no factor while dropping out last in the stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
SKOL CHANT was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, conceded some position entering the far turn while continuing
under patient handling, came around tiring foes to advance on the pacesetter in upper stretch and wrested the advantage from that foe late to gain a clear
advantage under firm handling. ACT LIKE ARTIE, reserved between foes three deep racing to the backstretch, commenced a steady advance three deep
racing into the far turn to gain a clear advantage racing into upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner. PLAYIN DISCO, in touch with the pacesetter
attending that rival's tempo to the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn to gain a brief advantage but proved no match for the top pair while
prevailing for a share. ZANDREA'S settled inside foes in the last flight early, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position
inside foes late. HELENA BEAT was rated along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, shifted out midway through the far turn but had
no closing bid. PORT SALERNO settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and passed between tiring rivals in late stages. VOLADOR
angled inwards racing to the first turn to track off the first flight between foes to the second bend and steadily faded nearing the lane. STRONG GEM, held
up avoiding close quarters at the start, settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. MILEY tracked off the second flight outside foes
racing to the backstretch, was caught four wide racing into the far turn and steadily faded. CALYPSO KEY, urged to the lead along the rail leaving the chute,
dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and gave way abruptly on the second bend.

AMBER PARADISE, a bit reluctant to load, then shuffled out of tight quarters at the start, switched outside rivals racing through the chute to gain a position
just off the second flight, was prompted to advance four wide nearing upper stretch but produced a solid late response to take charge and go clear under
firm left handed encouragement. GAELIC TALES, forwardly placed between rivals prompting the pace to the backstretch, dueled for command between
foes on the far turn to gain a narrow advantage midstretch, couldn't fend off the winner but prevailed for the place honors. FIRST IN COMMAND sped to the
lead along the rail racing to the first turn, maintained a narrow advantage to the second bend, dueled for command inside foes to upper stretch and
continued with interest to prevail for a share. DINN RIGH, forwardly placed three wide attending the pace to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far
turn to upper stretch and weakened late. FAIRY DIVA (GB) tracked off the first flight along the inside under light rating, shifted out five wide in upper stretch
and continued evenly. LADY ROSALIE (IRE), reserved between foes tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, swung out six wide racing through the
stretch but made no impression. IRISH CHARMER stalked off the first flight outside a rival racing three, then four deep into the far turn and faded between
foes into the stretch. LADY PALACE settled along the rail in the last flight racing to the first turn and offered no rally. SCHATZI, reserved outside foes in
early stages, proved no threat. SASSY SASS settled between foes in the last flight early and steadily retreated nearing the lane.
