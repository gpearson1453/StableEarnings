Footnotes
DOUBLE FIREBALL set the pace slightly off the rail, opened up in upper stretch, drifted out the final sixteenth of a mile and remained clear. TUFF BUT
FAIR lacked speed, raced in the two path in the stretch and rallied inside horses. MAVILUS , between horses in upper stretch, angled out and passed tired
rivals. CHAMPAGNE TOAST , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. HELLO GRACIE , a forward factor in the two path on the turn, angled
to the four path entering the stretch and gave way. MINESHAFT MAGIC , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, angled to the five path turning for
home and gave way. GARY DOING BIZ hugged the inner rail and faltered.

Footnotes
MOONSAFE eagerly made her way to command inside rivals leaving the chute, handled some outside pressure while under rating, continued under a hold
while saving ground around the turn, opened up after being set down in upper stretch, switched to her left lead near mid stretch and continued to widen
while kept to task. THIEF OF DREAMS settled off the rail, circled five wide into the lane, kept on with effort and was able to nab the place in the final yards.
ASBUILT rated four wide outside rivals early on, ranged up three wide to briefly threaten mid turn, could not go with the winner while under a ride into the
lane, stayed willingly past mid stretch then faded late. CURIOSITY KILLS forced the early pace outside the winner, was under asking trying to keep pace
past the three eighths, shifted four wide soon after and weakened. CASANOVA QUEEN saved ground and failed to make an impact. MEEMOO flashed foot
three deep, raced between foes nearing the turn then faltered.

DIVINE INTERVENTIO stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced three wide leaving the turn, swept to command in upper stretch, opened a clear
lead in mid stretch and was kept under steady handling. OTHER THINGS EQUAL hugged the inner rail on the turn, eased out leaving the turn and rallied
nicely between horses. JUST KIDDING assumed the early lead, set the pace near the rail, drifted out a bit entering the stretch and gave way. QUALITY
CHOICE raced between horses around the turn and in the stretch and failed to be a factor. WHIRLIN CURLIN , four deep on the turn, gave way. AULD
LANGE SYNE saved ground around the turn and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
KEEPER IN SPITE went clear right after the break and dropped in to secure the inside, set the pace while under a firm left grip, responded when put to
firmer asking in upper stretch and kept on eagerly while under solid encouragement. PETES PRIDE , taken to rate off the leader while saving ground, edged
up to the inside of a rival past the three eighths, angled out entering the lane and gave game chase to the wire. PROUD MANDATE lagged off the pace,
raced three wide into the lane, split rivals nearing mid stretch and churned on to get the show. EMBRACE A NEW DAY , four wide stalking the pace, was
under coaxing mid turn, circled five wide into the stretch, failed to kick on past mid stretch and faded. SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM , five wide mid turn, was not a
factor. STEP BY STEP , taken to rate off the pace, cut the corner into the stretch but lacked a bid. LAST GREAT lacked speed, swung wide around the turn
and was outrun. SPLASHERSTOWN rushed up to be the closest pursuer heading past the five eighths, chased outside a rival mid turn, failed to go on in
upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BUST OUT LADY came in leaving the starting gate, raced three deep leaving the turn, angled out in upper stretch, drifted in a bit when taking the lead near
the sixteenth pole and drew out. CONCRETE ANSWER sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and finished
willingly. THUNDERINTHEVALLEY , bumped and forced out by NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four deep, moved up to
challenge inside the eighth pole, flattened out and was herded by CONCRETE ANSWER near the sixteenth pole. WARRIOR'S BLADE saved ground on the
turn, swung wide in upper stretch and failed to rally. CAN I EVER lacked speed, drifted to the seven path in upper stretch and passed tired foes.
SCARLET'S SONG , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE bore out leaving the starting gate, raced three wide
on the turn and gave way. WESTERN MOVIES chased the pace three wide on the turn, faltered and was eased. TEMISINA dropped back entering the turn
and was eased.

Footnotes
TIZ AUCTION TIME vied inside, moved to a slim lead mid turn, moved away a bit soon into the lane, dug in when confronted past the three sixteenths,
wandered outward under left handed rousing and was resolute to the wire. WHATS THE CHANCES tracked the dueling leaders while outside a rival, moved
up four wide into the stretch, bid outside the winner heading to the furlong grounds, raced on even terms with a sixteenth to go, hung late and managed to
just save the place. NIC NIC BOOM rated two to three wide leaving the far turn, angled four to five wide advancing into the stretch and rallied between
rivals. BOSS LIFE , four wide early, angled six wide into the stretch and rallied mildly. QUEST OF GLORY , urged two wide while off the pace, shifted out
into the lane and worked his way between rivals in the final furlong. LITTLE BAY , bumped at the break, lagged well back early on, saved ground mid turn,
angle six wide into the lane and closed. TRUE SHIPMAN stalked the leaders while in the two wide, shifted in some in the drive but came up empty.
EXCHANGE FEVER was rated back after the start, steadied behind foes near the half mile pole, angled out leaving the three eighths, raced about four wide
in upper stretch then was caught in traffic with run through the final furlong. FIFTY SEVEN CHEVY settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out into
the lane, edged up behind rivals then altered well wide near the sixteenth pole. JUST GO WITH IT broke well and got into the pace battle outside the winner
soon after the break, kept up the fight to upper stretch then succumbed. ADIOS SEE YA lacked speed, was under urging off the rail leaving the far turn and
failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
IN THE LOOP accelerated to the early lead, set a pressured pace in the two path around the turn and drew off the final furlong. ZIGGY MON , three deep
prompting the winner around the turn, failed to match strides with that one in the drive and gamely held the pace. CAREY TIMES , rated down the
backstretch, raced in the four path on the turn, floated to the five path turning for home and rallied. GIRLS LOVE ME , shuffled back leaving the starting
gate, circled the turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth pole and rallied between horses. KARAN'S NOTION raced in a
forward position inside horses and weakened in the stretch drive. MO GOTCHA dropped back along the rail on the turn, remained inside horses through the
stretch and offered a late move. WORKIN ON A DREAM raced between horses and lacked a rally. GREAT CAMANOE , outside horses on the turn, gave
way. CHARGE TO VICTORY raced in the three path between horses on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
D C FIREMAN sped clear early, set a rated pace towards the inside, spurted away after being set down two wide in upper stretch, kept on under a stout
drive inside the furlong grounds and held sway. KEEPING THE PEACE settled off the pace while saving ground, crept up into the lane, eased out past the
three sixteenths and finished gamely to gain. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) stalked the winner three wide early on, was under a drive while four to five wide
into the lane and kept on willingly. IRISHTOWN rated off the early pace, swung well wide for the stretch run and had belated action. LUCKY JUNIOR broke
slowly, raced wide in the lane and failed to menace. START WITH YES prompted the pace outside the winner, was under coaxing three wide into the
stretch then weakened through the final furlong. SUPER BUDDY , wide early, dropped in some around the turn, raced in range to the quarter pole then gave
way.

the stretch, gave way and drifted out late. FRANKEE MERCH , in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, checked in close quarters near the five eighths
