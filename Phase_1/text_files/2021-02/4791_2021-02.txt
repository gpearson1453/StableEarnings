Footnotes
WATCH YOUR STEP set the pace and was well handled on the front, was bumped in mid stretch by BUMPA and lost his whip, dug in gamely late and
prevailed. BUMPA chased the winner throughout, rallied in the stretch and bumped with the winner, held grudgingly and just missed. TRUENO raced mid
pack and had a mild bid. CAPE MARCO DRIVE allowed to settle, failed to menace. PIRATE'S TREASURE raced wide early and tired on the far turn.
ROBERTOS TICKET contended until mid stretch, weakened badly late. TROOPER THORN was no factor.

Footnotes
WATCH THE DIP away alertly, set all the pace, turned back a strong bid from the runner up nearing the top of the stretch and proved best in a game effort
under left handed urging. CATES SWOOSH pressured the winner two wide, drew on near even terms for the lead nearing the quarter pole, kept on but
finished second best. SKY MIKE well placed, inched closer three wide on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. ANYTIMEALLTHETIME stalked the pace
from the inside and lacked the needed response. IRON DRILL settled mid pack and went evenly. PRETTY STORMY inside, failed to respond. SAN RULER
was no threat. YESUS STAR was outrun. COPPER GIDEON was through early.
