and just missed. TONY'S TAPIT followed the early pace, raced five wide into the turn, took control at the three sixteenths pole, opened up in mid stretch,

Footnotes
MAD AT MONEY was unhurried early, raced four wide through the second turn, was gaining late and was up in time. THORN HILL CAT raced in mid pack
early, advanced six wide through the second turn, was closing late and just missed. I'M AN EIGHT tracked the early pace, waited behind horses into the
home turn, found room between rivals in early stretch, took a brief lead and finished a game third. REMEMBERTOBREATHE was taken back early, raced
seven wide through the second turn and finished with a mild rally. TEDDY TIME was void of speed, circled eight wide through the second turn and offered
some late gain. CROW MOON set a pressured early pace, raced along the inside through the home turn and weakened late stretch. MIDNIGHT REVERIE
pressed the early pace, went three wide into the second turn and tired. REAL LUTE was allowed to settle early from between rivals and was empty.
SUNSCREEN was outrun early and was no faactor. MORE HONOR stalked the early pace from off the rail and faded.
