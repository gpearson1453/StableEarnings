Footnotes
KATE'S KINGDOM dropped well back inside early, made progress inside around the far turn, angled out near the quarter pole, closed strongly widest and
was up inside the sixteenth pole and won going away. UNION PARK GAL (IRE) was bumped soon after the start, raced closest to the runaway pacesetter
while racing two wide in the clear, took over turning for home, quickly cleared, led past the sixteenth pole but was no match for the winner late. BONHEUR
was a clear third while racing two wide for six furlongs, tipped three wide near the quarter pole and was one-paced through the lane. TALK DIRTY set a
clear pace along the rail and gave way leaving the quarter pole. NOT TONIGHT BOBBY steadied entering the first turn, raced three wide and never
threatened. SHINE A LIGHT had her head turned at the start, steadied entering the first turn, saved ground around that bend, raced two wide around the far
turn and lacked a closing bid. SWEET FELICIA played no factor while racing two and three wide. HASHTAG LUCKY was bumped just after the start,
checked repeatedly while rank through the opening quarter, raced two wide and played no further factor. THE RUN-UP WAS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
HIGH HEATER dueled inside of ROYAL SQUEEZE, shook clear from that foe approaching the quarter pole, held a clear margin into the late stages with
SURF SHACK gaining along the inside, and just held from that foe to the wire. SURF SHACK lagged behind the field early on, gained ground around the
turn, then sustained his rail charge through the lane, but missed. ROYAL SQUEEZE dueled outside of HIGH HEATER, but failed to keep pace with that foe
approaching the quarter pole, and tired through the lane. MAN OF VISION chased the leading duelers from the three path around the turn while inside of
SANDY'S BLAZE, but failed to menace. SANDYS BLAZE chased from the four path around the turn, and faded.

leaving the eighth pole, battled outside of that foe under a hand drive and edged ahead. MUDSLIDE WICKED set the pace along the rail, drifted out turning
for home, continued to drift through midstretch, brushed the winner leaving the eighth pole and battled on gamely inside of that foe to the wire. ALLURING
RUMBA went evenly inside. SEAMIALAUGH was in a bit tight at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. INTO CANDY chased the pace three wide
and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
AWESOME PUDDING set the pace along the inside, inched clear from a pressing rival at the five sixteenths pole, then dug in to hold an advantage from a
pair of foes turning for home, battled gamely inside of PERSPECTIVE through the final furlong, and repelled that rival in the final sixteenth. PERSPECTIVE
broke awkwardly and bumped with an inner foe soon after the start, gained into the turn to a three wide stalking position, ranged up to the leader turning for
home, but failed to reach that foe before being turned away in the late stages. BLACK BELT stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leader at the
quarter pole to bid along with PERSPECTIVE at the three sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by that foe while failing to keep pace with the leader passing
that marker, and stayed clear of fourth through the lane. SHOOTING tracked from midpack three wide, got keen behind ROYAL WAR when that foe took
back into the turn, shifted to the four path approaching the three furlong marker, then stayed on through the lane to claim a minor share. NAHUATL bumped
with an outer foe soon after the start, trailed the field down the backstretch, took the turn in the four to five path, then improved without factoring. WORK
ETHIC stalked three wide, shifted down two wide passing the half mile pole while just clear of ROYAL WAR to prompt the pace setter into the turn, but failed
to keep pace with that rival at the five sixteenths marker, and weakened thereafter. AMERICAN RULER saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail.
ROYAL WAR lied forwardly placed two wide and between horses early on, but was put to tight quarters when WORK ETHIC shifted down into the turn,
steadied mildly due to the incident, then was done early.

MEADE settled off the early pace outside, advanced three wide around the turn, seized command approaching the quarter pole and drew off under a drive.
BRASSTOWN stumbled at the start, sped to the front, set the pace a bit off the rail, was collared nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but
stayed on well to be a clear second. JANUARY WON saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and was along for the show. NACHO PAPA
advanced inside down the backstretch, was in range inside rounding the turn, tipped out near the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. DOCTOR D J
failed to menace while racing three and four wide. ROBINTAKINCHARGE prompted the pace two wide and tired in the lane. CANDY CRUSHEM played no
factor while racing four wide. AEQUOR had some speed two wide and steadily faded.

Footnotes
DASSULT MIRAGE tracked from midpack two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, rallied outside of foes to bid in the late stages, and got up
approaching the wire. MACH ONE prompted the pace two wide, shifted three wide in upper stretch, sustained vying position between horses into the late
stages, but was outfinished by an outer foe. MILITARY DRILL stalked along the inside, shifted two wide in upper stretch to split foes passing the furlong
grounds, bid for the lead inside of a pair of rivals in the late stages, but was outfinished by those foes. ALADO bobbled significantly at the start and trailed
the field along the inside early on, swung from the three path to the six path turning for home, and produced a mild kick, but failed to threaten the leaders.
WEIGHT OF GLORY set the pace along the inside, inched to a clear margin in upper stretch, but tired passing the furlong marker, got headed at the
sixteenth pole, and yielded late. NAVY PIER saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally to factor. COWBOY AT
HEART lied forwardly placed three wide, but drifted five wide in upper stretch, and faded thereafter.

sixteenth pole and quickly drew clear. KHOZZY VALINTINE set the pace along the rail, held clear past the eighth pole, was collared near the sixteenth pole
and stayed on to be clearly second best. LEYENDA settled off the pace while racing three wide and had a mild rally outside to gain the show. SUNSHINE
CITY prompted the pace two and three wide and came up empty in the lane. NICOLE PRINCESS stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch
and tired leaving the eighth pole. LIGHTS ON GIRL played no factor while racing four wide. VIVA LA REINA chased the pace three wide, retreated after a
half and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
NOBLE INDY stalked along the inside around the first turn while allowing SHOT TANKER (CHI) to clear off, shifted outside of that foe into the backstretch
while inside of IMPERIAL MISSION, was forced to make an early bid at the half mile pole as that foe pushed ahead, shifted down to the rail into the turn
without being clear of SHOT TANKER (CHI) and caused that rival to steady, vied inside of IMPERIAL MISSION around the far turn before claiming an
advantage from that one in upper stretch, then tired while maintaining a clear margin in the late stages, but held safe to the wire. PIONEER MAN stalked
along the inside, failed to keep pace with the early bidding rivals down the backstretch, chased those foes around the far turn, shifted outside of them in
upper stretch, and sustained a grinding rally through the lane, but ran out of ground to catch the leader. HIGH NOON RIDER rated well off of the pace two
wide, split foes turning for home before shifting four wide in upper stretch, and rallied to claim show in the late stages. IMPERIAL MISSION stalked two to
three wide around the first turn, made an early bid for the lead at the half mile marker forcing NOBLE INDY'S hand, showed the way outside of that foe
around the far turn, but failed to match strides with that one in upper stretch, and gave way passing the furlong pole. GO POKE THE BEAR trailed along the
inside early on, rated in the two path around the far turn, swung four wide turning for home, and stayed on, but failed to threaten. TIZZARUNNER lied off of
the pace along the rail before shifting off of it into the backstretch, altered four wide to surpass a weakening foe at the quarter pole, then got outkicked in
midstretch by an inner foe as that one floated him out five wide, and failed to factor. COUNTER OFFER saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail.
SHOT TANKER (CHI) led two wide into the first turn before clearing an inner foe at the six furlong marker, met a pair of bids at the half mile pole, got
headed before being squeezed along the inner rail at the three furlong marker, steadied due to the incident, then weakened around the far turn. RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.

MR. TIP raced off the pace outside, made strong progress three wide around the turn, seized command in upper stretch and drew off under a drive.
CHURCHILLS VICTORY stalked the pace from the rail, angled out near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and churned on to gain the
place in the final strides. CAUSALISTIC settled off the early pace between foes, advanced three wide around the far turn, bid nearing the lane but flattened
out in the drive. NOBLE EMPIRE prompted the pace two wide, faded nearing the lane, angled out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. MY GOOD MAN was
sluggish early, raced three wide and passed tiring rivals. DEPUTY CZAR was outrun inside. ROCKET BLAST set the pace along the rail and retreated
through the lane. TAAMER chased the pace four wide and was done after a half. BEACH TRAFFIC played no factor while racing two and three wide.
WICKSTERS DREAM collapsed midway around the turn and was vanned off.

Footnotes
FULMINI saved ground far off of the pace, split foes two wide while commencing a rally in midstretch, then surged in the final sixteenth to get up
approaching the wire. IT CAN BE DONE trailed two wide, took the turn in the two to three path before swinging five wide in upper stretch, and rallied outside
of foes to reach place approaching the wire. NITRO TIME set the pace along the inside, shook clear in upper stretch, but tired in the final sixteenth, and was
caught late. KASIM lied off of the pace in the two path around the turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and rallied through the final furlong, but was
outfinished by an outer foe and just missed reaching show. THINKABOUTIT lied forwardly placed two wide early on, took back from between horses into the
turn, took the turn three wide while inching closer, chased the leaders through upper stretch, but was outkicked by a pair of outer rivals in the late stages.
MR TINGLES chased three to two wide, attempted a bid for the lead turning for home, but was shrugged off entering the lane, then tired late.
KANTSTAROS gained to an inside stalking position early on, but failed to produce a bid, and faded through the final furlong. TODAYSTHEDAY lied off of
the pace in the three path around the turn, and failed to factor.
