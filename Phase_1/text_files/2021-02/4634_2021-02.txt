Footnotes
DARK MONEY away in good order, made it into the two path prior to departing the backstretch, was firmly rated disputing the pace to the outside of SAN
JUAN DIEGO, moved when ready approaching the five-sixteenths pole to wrest away the advantage, edged away in short order, still proceeding along
under his own power, struck the three-sixteenths marker and got called upon for more, offered up the desired response and lengthened away. SICILIA MIKE
inched his way over to the rail at the half mile pole, was put to a drive a furlong down the road, tipped into path two stepping onto the head of the stretch,
advanced towards the front runners, split foes with approximately a sixteenth to go and was along in time for second. KOSCIUSZKO loosely pocketed for
the opening half, angled three wide into the stretch, made no headway en route for the show. SAN JUAN DIEGO cut over to the inside route, vied with the
winner until the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, went into the lane and faltered. PLAYTHATFUNNYMUSIC underwent a two wide pursuit on the
turn, swung out four wide for the stretch run, came up empty. DESERT LIGHTS put to a vigorous hand ride for almost the initial panel after breaking a
length the tardiest, raced two to three wide on the turn, got sent out five from upper to midstretch, never made his presence while trailing throughout.

Footnotes
AFLEETING GLANCE three wide down the backstretch in pursuit from mid pack, tucked inside into the turn and advanced in hand to issue a challenge
three furlongs from home up an open rail, received taps to the off side taking command near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home shaking
away, got tapped to the off side and went clear in hand through to the finish to prevail comfortably at the end. BIG RED GIRL coaxed from the gate, led early
on before being engaged by IDAKA and dueled with that rival to her outside three to four paths off the inside to the five-eighths before easing off, went three
wide through the turn coming again to issue a challenge taking narrow and brief command under coaxing three furlongs from home, got headed by the top
one near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, proved no match for that rival weakening through the final furlong while able to preserve the place
honors. CENTRAL CAPITAL chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, got placed to coaxing at
the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, improved position to the finish while along for the show honors. MIZZYS IMAGE broke out at the start
and was corrected, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung
five wide into upper stretch and tired. SHE'S AN ALPHA coaxed from the gate, chased four wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, continued four
wide into upper stretch and tired. SOPHIE FATALE bobbled at the break, crossed inside to chase from the two path, tucked to the rail half a mile from home,
got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. IDAKA ranged up after the start to knock
heads with BIG RED GIRL to her outside while racing just off the inside, established sole command five furlongs from home and briefly shook free into the
turn, remained off the rail and came under pressure from flanking challengers three furlongs from home yielding the front near that station under urging,
angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch in retreat and folded in the drive.

Footnotes
BETA remained prominently placed after out-breaking the competition, went at it against two others early on the backstretch before shaking them off, slid
over to the inside at the top of the turn, kicked clear during the run around the bend, settled in at the head of stretch, drew off, ridden out. CURLIN'S
KNIGHT prompted the winner from path two, got set down crossing the midway point of the turn, lost ground on BETA, cut the corner into the lane, lost
additional ground. ROYAL SUSPECT hustled on the chute, worked out a tuck into the three path, got asked for more at the five-sixteenths pole after seeing
the top one extend the margin, spun into the lane and flattened out. LIGHTNING ROB saved ground for nearly six furlongs, swung out four wide into the
lane, never made an impact garnering the last major check. KING OF AMERICAN off the inside, was under a hand ride travelling three wide on the turn,
shifted towards path five for the stretch drive, lacked the necessary response. I SEE THE STARS pursued the pace from path two, left the three-eighths
pole having been placed to a brisk hand ride, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, gave way. SUPER WICKED CHARM three wide onto the
turn, moved into the path four entering the lane, never got involved. PRICING EXERCISE sighted pulling on the left early, rode the rail for a good portion of
the opening three-quarters, tipped into path two for entrance into the stretch, tired.

Footnotes
ROSIES SURPRISE tracked the pace along the inside under rating, got set down spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command
nearing the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive kept to task. MARIA'S GIFT led early on before being displaced from the front by AURANNIAN with
seven furlongs to run, attended that rival to the outside between foes in the two path, advanced nearing the five-sixteenths and took command inside that
station, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under lone threat and was collared nearing the eighth pole, kept on to chase the winner home well clear of
the rest and along second best. EMMA AND I chased three then four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and
passed tired rivals to secure the show honors. NEW YORK BANKER three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. AURANNIAN veered in at the start forcing WISH FOR MAGIC to be steadied in behind and conceded
four lengths to the front before settling into stride, ranged up to take command seven furlongs from home and showed the way in hand along the inside
under attendance from a pair to the outside, had those rivals intensify the pressure through the turn and got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded
the front inside that station, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. WISH FOR MAGIC broke out a step and was steadied at the start as
AURANNIAN veered directly in front and conceded five to six lengths to the front, chased two then three wide under light coaxing from midway on the turn,
angled four wide for home and tired. THE GREAT POOHDINI came under hustling from the start and tipped out to chase four wide, got coaxed along
nearing the five-sixteenths, went five wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
YANKEE DIVISION rushed up along the inside route to grab away the advantage just as the first fraction was to be posted, sailed along after opening up,
was asked for more in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, responded to stay well in the clear. TWISTED TOM underwent a ground-saving journey,
stayed on for the place. ADVANCED STRATEGY along the outside, raced three wide on the turn, fanned out towards path six from upper to midlane, went
on to secure the show. WUDDA U THINK NOW stalked the winner afar from path two, was under a drive by the five-sixteenths pole stepped onto the head
of the stretch and backed away. MICROSCOPE was being urged along pursing the pace two wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path wider,
lacked the necessary response. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD travelled two to three wide on the turn, got sent out five wide into upper lane, gave way.
BOURBON BAY three wide onto the turn, was in path four exiting it, folded. FREAKY STYLEY spotted along the inside route, was under some hand
encouragement proceeding along the backstretch, got roused by the five-sixteenths pole, faltered.

Footnotes
REGGAE MUSIC MAN dueled early on inside of FORTY TWO ACE before shaking off that rival midway on the turn, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, got roused straightened away and drew off under a drive to prevail. PURPLE HEARTED got steadied at the start when rivals closed his lane
conceding three lengths to the front, chased just off the inside down the backstretch, came out slightly into the turn forcing COX'S LEDGE to pause in
between rivals in a bit tight and nudging KING MOONRACER before tucking along the inside, got coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, cornered just off
the inside for home and ran on to secure the place honors. FORTY TWO ACE dueled from the three path down the backstretch with the top one to his
inside, tucked to the two path through the turn and was steadily shaken off coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch
and weakened in the late stages. LUCKY BRODY five paths off the inside down the backstretch, went three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired. COX'S LEDGE chased four then three wide and was paused in tight between foes after tucking to the
two path half a mile from home losing about a length in position, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. KING
MOONRACER chased four then three wide getting bumped lightly by PURPLE HEARTED just inside the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, cornered three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SHAMROCKED along the inside route, got engaged in a duel with IT'S HOT OUT just about from the get-go, edged away from the nemesis as the half was
being completed, settled in and was set down for the drive, began to gradually drift to the outside all the while desperately clinging to an ever-dwindling
advantage, saw the runner up looming boldly from the rail in deep stretch, but displaying good determination, reached the wire in time to get the job done.
FREUDIAN SIP guided over to the rail, was one of three front runners on near even terms with other bumping with each other departing the backstretch, sat
loosely pocketed afterwards eyeing the ongoing pace dispute, was put to a drive cutting the corner into the stretch, closed the gap in a steadfast manner
with the one to catch himself steadily making his way towards the middle of the strip, missed. THOUSAND PERCENT off the rail, pursued the pace mostly
four wide on the turn, stepped into the lane, stayed on for the show. TALE OF MIST four wide onto the turn, was about as wide exiting it, mustered up a mild
kick to earn the final significant slice of the pot. DIDDLEY took up the chase two wide in midpack, was bumped from between rivals entering the turn,
ventured onward into the lane, made no headway. SEETHISQUICK parked out five wide on the turn, was as wide entering the stretch, made no impact.
VICAR'S LEGEND off the inside on the backstretch, got spotted on the rail at the half mile pole, fanned out six wide from upper to midlane, had no
response. IRISH ROAR (IRE) guided into the three path, was one of a threesome bumping each other stepping onto the top of the turn, fell back late on the
bend, shifted towards path four entering the lane and backed away. IT'S HOT OUT sparred with the winner from the two path for the opening half and
retreated.

Footnotes
MI TRES POR CIENTO (CHI) settled just off the inside just in behind a pace dispute, remained patiently handled until set down angled five wide into upper
stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command nearing the sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish kept busy to the
end. WICKED TRICK stumbled at the start recovering inwards and bumping with CELTIC CHAOS, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. SECRET RULES dueled from the get go from the two path with
RAGTIME BLUES to his inside, raced between foes briefly as MORE GRAYTFUL joined them midway on the turn, shook off RAGTIME BLUES confronted
by the outside rival and dueled with that foe through the latter portion of the turn into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat and was collared
nearing the sixteenth pole, then kept on to preserve the show honors. CELTIC CHAOS bumped at the start by WICKED TRICK, who recovered inwards
from a stumble, chased along the inside from near the rear isolated between the main body of the field and T LOVES A FIGHT well behind, came under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the last major share. MORE GRAYTFUL three wide in aim
just off the duel down the backstretch, advanced three wide through the turn to vie briefly with a pair to his inside before knocking heads with SECRET
RULES through the latter portion of the bend, got let out spinning three wide for home, dug in under a drive prominent to the eighth pole before weakening
in the late stages. MONEY RIDE stumbled at the start recovering inwards filling the space vacated by the leaping T LOVES A FIGHT, chased two to three
wide down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the drive. RAGTIME BLUES dueled inside of SECRET RULES from the get go, came under pressure from a pair midway on the turn and was
shaken off through the latter portion of the turn nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home at that station and tired. T LOVES A FIGHT a bit
fractious in the gate prior to the start, was unsettled when the latch was sprung and leapt up at the start getting away last and conceding six to seven
lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside detached at the tail of the field well behind, took to the two path through the turn, went
eight wide into upper stretch and was allowed to finish the course under his own power having lost all chance at the start.

Footnotes
APEX PREDATOR was put to some light hand urging establishing the top, cut over to the inside route, showed the way, accompanied by LADY'S BOY from
the outside, settled in upper stretch and got called upon for more, held on well in the final furlong to preserve the decision. ALITE rode the rail, cut the corner
into the lane, got staved off. TRIPLE AMERICANO pursued the pace three to four wide on the turn, was about as wide going down the stretch, went fairly
evenly late en route for the show award. SECOND FORTUNE along the outside, raced towards path four on the turn, flashed some interest as the half was
being completed, tipped one path farther off the rail entering the stretch, rallied mildly. FOREST SPIRIT took up position in midpack two wide, made some
headway during the later stages of the run around the bend, got worked into the four path from upper to midstretch, flattened out. LADY'S BOY pressed the
issue from the two path, challenged in earnest heading home, wasn't up to the task at hand and backed away. LORD CAMDEN two wide onto the turn, got
sent out into path three exiting it, came up empty. HEREISSIO checked getting squeezed in the shadow of the starting gate, was down along the inside well
before arriving at the conclusion of the backstretch, went on to save ground to no avail. DANEGELD hung out three to four wide on the turn, got moved out
into path five during the stretch, tired. LIQUOR a forward factor in the three path, folded.
