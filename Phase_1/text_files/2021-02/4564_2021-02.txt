the stretch run. ISOLATOR close up between horses early but gave way readily. BEOCCA awkward start and never a menace. WEEKEND AT LARRY'S
awkward start, close up to turn outside, stopped. LIGHTNING ROD CARL backed up quickly and never a factor. RIGHTEOUS ROY never prominent.

Footnotes
WINGING WAYS just off pace to turn took over, cleared proving much the best. GRAN ROJO between horses to turn, ran on in the drive for place late.
ANIMAL KRACKERS unhurried early, inside run in the stretch for the show spot. BROADWAY JOE bumped start, off rail to turn, improved position in the
stretch. KOBE BEACH inside chase while evenly with no late kick when needed. QUEEN'S PALACE good speed outside, dueled two path out of turn,
empty. S S SMARTY inside stretch run while never close. I'M JUST FINE staggered from the gate then knocked sideways after the start, never a threat
thereafter and losing best chance. NO NAY NOW (IRE) tracked three wide to turn, gave way readily. ZIGGY BARCELONA through after half, dropped back
thereafter. GRATIFIED race wide while never close after being bothered at the start. RHETT THOMAS always trailed after a slow start
