Footnotes
HELLO GRACIE , unhurried down the backstretch, circled horses three wide on the turn, was fanned four deep entering the stretch, swept to command in
upper stretch, was under urging and held sway. KEYED UP , four deep on the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and rallied. MY WAY OR ELSE
saved ground on the turn, raced in the two path in the stretch and flattened out between horses. AWFULLY FOXY , two wide on the turn, angled to the inner
rail near the eighth pole and rallied mildly. GOLDEN MOON SHINE bobbled at the break, sped to the early lead, raced near the rail on the turn, drifted to the
two path turning for home and weakened. QUICKSTRIKE prompted the pace outside GOLDEN MOON SHINE, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way.
POETS PRINCESS hugged the inner rail most of the trip and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TINY TIN bobbled at the break, recovered and settled within range while well off the inside, circled five wide advancing into the lane and took aim on the
embattled leading trio, sustained under left handed asking past the eighth pole, took a short lead while attempting to lay in past the sixteenth marker then
was fully extended to prevail. PAT'S FACTOR saved ground while moving up into the turn, eased out and bid between foes mid turn, dueled from there then
gained a short lead nearing the furlong grounds, kept on gamely to the inside of the winner but wasn't quite good enough. MANKLIN CREEK leaned in at
the break and bumped with a rival, dropped well off the early pace, circled five wide into the stretch, was getting in through the final furlong and closed.
GOLDIE'S BOY , bumped at the break, recovered and stalked off the rail, bid three deep mid turn, battled between foes nearing mid stretch, stayed on his
left lead and faded late. KEEPYOURGUARDUP disputed the early pace towards the rail, shook clear into the turn, was joined by a pair of rivals heading to
the three eighths, remained a factor past the three sixteenths then gave way. STRICTLY BUSINESS saved ground off the early pace, made a mild run past
the three furlong marker, eased out for the drive but came up empty. LAUREL LAD , between runners leaving the far turn, faltered. CHICO CON ALEX was
hard used from the gate, battled outside KEEPYOURGUARDUP for about three and a half furlongs then faltered.

STAY OUT showed speed three deep down the backstretch, opened a clear lead on the turn, steadily increased her advantage through the stretch and was
ridden out. CATCH THE SKY , well off the rail on the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and rallied. HAD THE NOTION lacked speed, was wide on
the turn, floated to the six path turning for home, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. PROMENADE PRINCESS hugged the rail on the turn,
remained inside horses in the stretch and flattened out. TEQUILA FOG showed brief speed, raced along the rail most of the trip and passed a pair of tired
rivals late. CREATIVE ALIBI , three wide mid way on the turn, was not a factor. ALWAYS SOMETHING , three wide on the turn, weakened. UTTERLY
ENCHANTING showed speed inside the winner and gave way the final furlong.

Footnotes
LIV AND LET LIV , under a snug hold tracking the dueling leaders, bid three deep under confident handling heading towards the quarter pole, came about
four wide for the drive, responded to strong asking past the three sixteenths, wrested command near the sixteenth marker and was edging away late.
PARADISE SONG took command soon after the break, set a pressured pace inside while under some rating, responded when set down soon into the lane,
could not resist the winner but kept on well to the line. KEWPIE DOLL edged up towards the inside leaving the far turn, took aim on the battling trio nearing
the stretch but failed to follow through in the final furlong. ADELAIDE MISS disputed the pace outside PARADISE SONG, was caught between runners
dueling into the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and weakened. TAYLER'S CHROME , sluggish from the gate, was under the whip leaving
the far turn, dropped in and lacked a stretch bid. DOUBLE FIREBALL , four wide pursuing the early pace, dropped back mid turn.

Footnotes
REVOLUTIONARY ROAD prompted the pace three deep down the backstretch, gained a short lead on the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch, battled
back and drove clear late. BIG HAMBONE , four deep around the turn, rallied. WONDER IN , in the two path between horses on the turn, remained between
rivals in the stretch and flattened out. NAUTICAL NATURE lacked speed, worked between horses through the stretch and rallied. ROCK AND FELLERS
(ARG) raced in the three path on the turn, floated to the five path in mid stretch and flattened out outside foes. D C FIREMAN showed speed inside foes,
disputed the pace to the eighth pole and gave way in the drive. MYSTIC TIMES , no factor, raced in the six path in mid stretch. SMART STEP hugged the
inner rail most of the trip and was not a factor. DAYSTRIKE saved ground on the turn, angled to the three path in upper stretch and failed to be a factor.
BANO SOLO showed early speed in the two path between horses then weakened. IWISHIWASPECIAL , wide on the turn, was outrun.

VANQUISHER , bumped at the break and was off a bit slow, recovered and settled well off the inside, commenced a run while outside rivals leaving the far
turn, circled five wide into the lane, drifted in a bit then was corrected with left handed asking, closed strongly to take command inside the sixteenth marker
and was eagerly going away at the wire. MOSLER'S TOUCH sped to the front and set a rated pace towards the inside, moved away under encouragement
past the three sixteenths, proved no match for the winner but kept on willingly to the finish. TOUGH ONE prompted the pace two wide outside the leader,
was under coaxing into the stretch, stayed on well to about the sixteenth pole then faded. THIEF OF DREAMS came in at the break and bumped with a
rival, raced four wide around the turn and offered a mild response. NO CHANCE GIVEN drifted in at the break and was off a bit slowly, was taken to rate off
the pace, steadied between runners leaving the far turn, angled out for the drive, advanced between foes in mid stretch and churned on. DETERMINED
HONOR saved ground early, angled out near mid turn, raced four to five wide into the lane, was taken up soon after, regrouped but lacked the needed
finish. CLAIRE'S DARLING saved ground stalking the pace and faded. MEEMOO edged up three wide nearing the half mile marker to stalk the pace,
pursued between rivals past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and gave way. INDIAN NICHOLS saved ground, eased out in upper stretch
but lacked a solid rally. SUDSY , three wide into the turn, dropped back, swung well wide and came up empty. AMERICAS WOMAN , off slowly, raced off
the pace while saving ground and failed to menace.

Footnotes
EXCELLORATOR lacked speed, circled the turn, was fanned six deep in upper stretch, closed strongly outside horses and swept to command inside the
sixteenth pole. THE WOLFMAN , right to the early lead, was in hand in the two path around the turn, opened up in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly.
SILENT SERVICE prompted the pace outside THE WOLFMAN and weakened in the drive. SUE LOVES BARBADOS hugged the inner rail around the turn,
remained inside horses through the stretch and weakened. GOLDEN GULLEY , in the five path between hoses turning for home, failed to rally. ERIC'S
EMPIRE chased the pace three wide on the turn, angled to the four path entering the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
PRINCE JAMES prompted the pace three wide, was well handled while contesting the pace between rivals mid turn, responded when put to firm asking in
upper stretch, spurted clear with a furlong to go then dug in late under strong handling to prevail. FLAT OUT FLYING , rank at the break, steadied back from
between foes, recovered leaving the chute and settled off the rail, took closer order past the three eighths, angled six wide into the lane, made a grinding run
through the final furlong but ran out of ground. SILENT MALICE , in tight at the break, regrouped and dropped in to make progress past the five eighths,
angled out and circled six wide gaining into the lane, loomed boldly past the three sixteenths, drifted in while on his left lead and flattened out. ABSOLVED
chased towards the rail, eased out in the drive, moved up a bit in mid stretch but went evenly late. SEA GHOST , off the pace, raced three wide into the
lane, angled out then had belated interest. THE REVENGER grabbed command leaving the chute, set the pace two wide while handling outside pressure,
kept up the battle past the three sixteenths then weakened nearing the sixteenth marker. GENTLEMAN JOE came in at the break and bumped with a rival,
corrected and stalked five wide, bid outside foes leaving the far turn, dueled to the head of the lane then gave way. SASSY KING , off slowly, dropped far
back early on, saved ground into the lane but lacked a solid recovery. AL BROWN , four wide prompting the pace, bid between runners after a half mile,
forced the issue to the five sixteenths pole then faltered through the drive.

and rallied outside horses. STAND MY GROUND lacked speed, raced wide on the turn, floated to the seven path in upper stretch and passed tired horses.
EL ROJO raced in mid pack and failed to rally. EXCHANGE FEVER stalked the pace three wide on the turn and gave way in the drive. LITTLE BAY , along
the inner rail leaving the turn, was not a threat. THE EXCEPTION was no factor. BOSS LIFE showed speed along the rail, bumped with KISSEDTHEGIRLS
near the three eighths pole and weakened. TWINSTINCT bumped with FINE N DANDY at the break, drifted wide leaving the turn, gave way and was eased.
