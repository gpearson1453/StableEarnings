DADDY'S MELODY set a pressured early pace, raced along the inside through the home turn, dueled with BOLD REY to the wire, drifted out and prevailed
for the win. BOLD REY pressed the early pace, went three wide into the second turn, dueled with the winner and just missed for the win. OCEAN DREAM
was unhurried early, raced along the inside, angled out in early stretch, was gaining late and needed more ground. PERFECTLY SEASONED stalked the
early pace, went four wide into the second turn and was empty late. MCGLORIOUS raced in mid pack early, raced between rivals into the home turn and
offered no late rally. D'TATWAY tracked the early pace, went five wide into the second turn and flattened out. MISS SHAWHAN was void of speed, raced
four wide into the second turn and was no factor. HERE'SLOOKINATYA was taken back early, saved ground into the home turn and never fired.

Footnotes
TEXAS LONG BOW set a pressured early pace, went five wide into the turn, drifted in and drew off as an easy winner. LONNIE TON pressed the early
pace, went six wide into the turn, drifted in , was no match late and finished second best. BANZE NO OESTE (BRZ) was unhurried early, loomed seven
wide through the turn, made a bid at the quarter pole and flattened out. FLOWER BEACH raced in mid pack early, raced between rivals into the turn, angled
out and finished evenly. KICKENIT was allowed to settle early, went four wide into the turn, angled in and offered no late rally. EMBELLISHING BOB was
outrun early, raced along the inside into the turn, angled out eight wide out of the turn and never fired. COOL HAND LUCAS was void of any speed and was
never a factor. DAYTONA BEACH chased the early pace, from off the rail and faded.

a clear early pace, went four wide into the turn, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. MOONLITE GRAHAM was off slow, rushed to be in a
stalking position, angled out through the turn, angled in through late stretch and was closing late. DIIACHI was taken back early, went five wide into the turn,
angled out to the eight path through the stretch and finished with a mild late rally. COLONEL TRAVERS was reserved early, went three wide into the turn
and offered no late rally. N. K. ROCKET MAN was allowed to settle early, raced six wide and never fired. LEGAL WEAPON followed the early pace from
between rivals and weakened.
