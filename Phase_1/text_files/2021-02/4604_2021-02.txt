BEREN vied outside, took over after half a mile and pulled away eagerly while kept to his business. MEAN MACHINE lacked speed, advanced inside on the
turn and closed well while no threat. RUFFY settled behind the pacesetters and and continued willingly to the finish. IMPERIAL ROAD vied along the rail to
the stretch and came up empty. MARVALOUS MIKE settled off the pace in the two path and lacked a rally. NORRIN RADD was extremely rank and difficult
to handle in the opening quarter and never a factor. AUSTIN WHYLIE dropped back early and was never in contention. O'BRIEN chased outside and
weakened steadily. THE GREAT GAZOO raced outside and gave way readily.

Footnotes
LITTLEBITALILY vied for the lead outside, pulled away in the stretch and remained safe while kept to a drive. CAWAJA TIME raced close up between rivals
and continued gamely making a gradual gain. HERO FOR HIRE steadied inside at the far turn, was taken up midway on the turn and finished gamely. LADY
MAGICA prompted the pace inside then flattened out through the stretch. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR broke very slowly, raced wide and was no factor.
KAREN'S GEM dropped back early, was in tight on the turn and no factor. LADY VALENTINA stumbled badly at the start, raced very wide and was no
threat. STREET APPEAL made a menacing three wide bid on the turn then stopped through the lane. WILDCATTIN forced the pace outside to the stretch
and gave way.

LAKE CHICOT set the pace racing a bit off the inside, dueled on the far turn, edged away in upper stretch, dug in gamely and held well under urging.
SHEMAKESMEHAPPY hopped and was off slowly, raced three wide off the pace, moved up on the far turn, rallied steadily outside in the stretch and got up
late for second. STEADY LOVE pressed the pace racing close up outside rivals, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled, dug in gamely in the final furlong and
lost second. EVIL WOMAN raced close up on the inside throughout, was in tight on the rail on the far turn, made an inside bid at the top of the lane, then
weakened. SWEET MAGGIE MAE trailed the field and passed tired rivals. MONACO PRINCESS pulled on the first turn, raced off the pace between rivals
and had no rally. BAMBOO GARDEN raced three wide early, then stalked two wide, chased and faded. IT'S SO EASY raced off the pace inside and did not
factor.

Footnotes
MAVILUS settled inside, angled wide rallying at the quarter pole then eagerly edged away late. HAY NINETEEN vied along the rail, was collared by the
winner in mid stretch and finished willingly. GOING GOING GONE reserved behind the pacesetters, awaited room on the turn then flattened out when clear.
INCOMPARABLE trailed for half a mile inside, remained along the rail and closed well too late. MY GLORY chased very wide while outrun and was never in
contention. FEYRE prompted the leaders three wide for half a mile and gave way. STEPPING FORWARD dueled between rivals to the quarter pole and
stopped. JENNA THE BOSS raced off the leaders four wide down the backstretch and faded.

Footnotes
KING'S HOUSE pulled a bit early, stalked the dueling leaders, bid three wide at the quarter pole, took charge, drew clear under urging and held well.
FLASHY KYEM steadied at the start, chased three wide between rivals, came wide, rallied outside in the stretch drive and dug in gamely to the finish.
DENNIS' DIAMOND chased inside, angled out entering the stretch, rallied mildly outside and got up late for a share of the show spot. CATCH FIRE chased
the pace, raced inside on the turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied between rivals and held on for a dead heat of third. NICK THE CARDSHARK raced
off the pace, moved up four wide on the turn and closed belatedly outside. GET THE W chased between rivals and lacked a rally. FORMAN THE
FOREMAN bobbled at the break, dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and tired. SUCCESSFUL ZIP was off slowly and steadied, dropped far back
early, then gained some ground. HOLLYWOOD TALENT chased three wide and faded. STREET TAIL dueled two wide for the lead, battled on the turn and
gave way.

Footnotes
TRAPPE ME LATER set a pressured pace inside, moved clear into the stretch and remained safe driving. TO THE FLAG saved ground close up and
continued willingly to the finish. ROCHELA saved ground throughout and closed well too late. BON HEIR lacked speed, moved very wide on the turn
advancing and closed willingly. ENCHANTABULL angled to the two path on the turn and flattened out. RISQUE EXPRESS raced off the pace outside and
lacked a rally. HER DIVINENESS dueled between rivals to the stretch and came up empty. MAD MARY dropped back early and was never in contention.
GIRL POWDER dropped back early and was never a factor. LUNA AZTECA lagged far behind throughout. FLEUR DE FORCE trailed early and was always
outrun. WOMAN FLYER broke alertly and dueled three wide then stopped abruptly.
