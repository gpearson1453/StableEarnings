PARK RIDGE BENNY showed good speed, disputed the pace between horses to the half-mile pole, vied inside to the two path on the turn, shook clear
outside the quarter-pole, responded well when set down at the three-sixteenths and maintained a safe advantage under steady urging. NICE WORK settled

finished willingly for the place. ZYPTO bumped with a rival just after the start, was well placed towards the front, went three to four wide on the turn, was
asked for his best in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. ROCK ME disputed the pace on the outside, vied two to three wide
on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired. ROCK ON KITTEN settled towards the back on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came six wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. RED CLAY MAGIC moved in early, pressed the pace on the inside, dropped back at the half-mile pole, saved ground
on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths and came up empty. HOMELAND MESSA bumped with a rival after the start, settled at the rear of the field,

Footnotes
AWE SHACKLE was hustled to the front, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, drew off under a
drive into the final furlong and maintained a safe advantage under steady urging. EMERALD FOREST chased the pace, went three wide on the turn,
pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch, drifted out while gaining at the sixteenth-pole and was far clear for the place. BLACK HAWK RIDGE settled
off the pace, went three wide under urging on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was best of the rest. B W P SPECIAL chased the pace down the
backstretch, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then drifted in and tired. BOORNAZIAN bumped with a rival at the start, was urged
along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and failed to rally. PASION AZTECA broke a bit slow, dropped well behind the rest of the field, went
four on the turn and was no factor. POWERFUL MAN bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and
failed to respond. NOT A NYKI settled on the far outside, dropped back while five wide on the turn, floated eight wide into the stretch and faltered.

MORE THAN UNUSUAL saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace, went three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in
while making a bid at the three-sixteenths then took the advantage, shook clear while still on her inside lead into the final furlong then swapped to the proper
lead when pulled in by the rider and accelerated away under a brisk hand ride to prove much the best. FIRESIDE KITTEN went to the front, set the clear
pace on the inside, was challenged on the far turn then asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch, dropped back into the
final furlong and proved no match while just able to get the place. FATE FACTOR went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused four
wide on the far turn and just missed the place while able to get the show. VERUCA was taken in hand early, dropped from the two path to the rail early on
the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole and came up empty. I HEAR
YOU dropped well behind early, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, saved ground on the far turn, checked behind
DECLARATIONWARRIOR inside the five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. MICROCAP brushed with a foe into
the first turn, went four then three wide on that bend, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked at the three-eighths then urged along in the two path on
the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and capitulated. DECLARATIONWARRIOR brushed with a foe into the first turn, went three wide on that bend,
was rated on the outside, dropped back while three then two wide on the far turn and faltered. (Rail at 8 Feet)

SAN DESTIN settled at the rear of the field, moved out late on the backstretch, was roused five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch under a
left-handed crop, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. LOVE ENOUGH tracked the pace on the outside, went four then
three wide on the turn, made a bid inside the three-eighths, shook clear into upper stretch, was put to a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker,
remained clear into the final sixteenth then drifted out late and was caught while clear for the place. SEASCAPE was reluctant to load, pressed then chased
the pace on the outside, went two to three wide on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch and weakened while able to get the show. RUN COOKIE RUN
settled off the pace, was urged four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. DYNAMITE GIFT moved in while
settling off the pace, advanced closer late on the backstretch, drafted in the two path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole then came three wide
into the stretch and capitulated. TORCH OF HONOR was hustled to the lead, set the pace under some pressure to her outside, vied in the two path early on
the turn then dropped to the rail, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole and faded.

Footnotes
LINDA GOT LUCKY showed the way down the backstretch, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, extended the advantage into upper stretch,
responded well when set down outside the furlong marker and powered away under vigorous hand urging. DAD'S STAR CAT settled off the pace, saved
ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. BRIGHTNMORNINGSTAR broke
out at the start, was forwardly placed on the outside, went four then five wide under urging on the turn, floated six wide into upper stretch and tired then lost
the place but held the show. BUSINESS LADY was rated off the pace, went around the turn in the two then path, was roused four wide into the stretch and
failed to respond. HERE COMES LINDA acted-up just as the gate opened but broke with the field, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on
the turn and came up empty. DARE TO HOPE raced just off the pace, moved from the inside to the two path on the turn and had nothing left. MY HEART
DOMINUS raced well back in the field, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. BABY MAYBE went five to six wide on
the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and showed little.
