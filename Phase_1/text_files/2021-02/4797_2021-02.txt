Footnotes
IAINTFRAIDANOGHOST dueled early on from the four path with TEKILA to her inside, shook off that rival quickening a bit as a pair of foes advanced
outside near the half mile pole, tucked to the two path into the turn, had TEKILA re-engage inside and vied amongst a quartet between foes through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took narrow command near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive
to prevail. STRONG POINT three then four wide in pursuit from the tail of the compact field, the only rival not to stack up vying for the front through the turn,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the place honors. BRAVO REGINA lunged slightly
at the start, raced five wide in aim of the front down the backstretch advancing into the turn in tandem with COAL SHAFT, tucked three wide through the
bend vying for command between foes and coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages.
TEKILA broke in at the start and was corrected coming under coaxing to range up inside in the two path and duel with IAINTFRAIDANOGHOST from the six
furlong marker until inside the nine-sixteenths, got shaken off a bit as the pace subtly quickened and came under urging and an off sided stick tucking inside
half a mile from home, came again along the inside to vie inside a trio three furlongs from home through the latter portion of the turn to the quarter pole, took
the inside route into upper stretch at that station, then weakened in the final furlong. COAL SHAFT six paths off the inside in range of the front down the
backstretch, advanced on the leader in tandem with BRAVO REGINA nearing the half mile pole, tucked four wide through the turn and vied outside a trio
from the midway point to upper stretch, swung four wide at that juncture, then weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
DIAL ME UP out with its initial steps, made contract with JASMINESQUE, cleared the field soon afterward,s was rated along showing the way from along
the inside route, had the runner up draw nearly abreast as the second split was being finalized, settled in at the top of the lane and was given her cue, put
away the challenger and edged clear. MIND OF GOLD stalked DIAL ME UP two to three wide, issued an abbreviated bid coming up to the quarter pole, got
flicked off, stayed on well to salvage second. QUASAR brushed in the shadow of the starting gate, was reserved in the two path was cued up turning into
the lane, got outkicked. CADEAU DE PAIX saved ground for a good portion of the trip leading up to the quarter pole, angled three wide into the stretch,
lacked the necessary response. SKY KITTEN off the inside, raced three wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path wider, gave way.
JASMINESQUE darted over to the rail after being pinched at the break, stayed put until the end of the bend, fanned out into path five from upper to midlane,
becoming the widest of all, had no offering.

Footnotes
ZOOMER established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, remained patiently handled until set
down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to prevail. TENDERFOOT chased along the inside, cut the corner roused into
upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors well clear of the rest to be along second best. CHESTERTOWN
chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, had the rider take out the stick to the
near side straightening away and shied out two to three paths, then tired in the stretch. DANNY CALIFORNIA stumbled badly at the start popping the rider
out of the off side iron and conceding three to four lengths to the front, settled into stride and back in the irons in the opening sixteenth and chased two then
three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

MY FIRST GRAMMY was coaxed to the top, led the way towards the two path, was forced to fend off two others while between them on the turn, came
under heavier pressure from both sides as three-quarters was being completed, was called upon stepping three wide onto the top of the lane, got headed by
AHHAR as the run leading up to and then through the furlong grounds was being completed, displayed no quit, gamely re-claiming the advantage by the
slimmest of margins to prove best. AJHAR forwardly placed, stalked the winner three wide during the opening phases, went about the task as the outermost
of a threesome after entering the turn, got set down spinning into the lane, appeared to be a head to the good at the beginning of the last eighth, saw the
winner fight its way back to the lead, wound up the one being denied. ZUZUDINI strung out four wide while under a ride on the turn, commenced the stretch
run by tipping one wider, got outkicked. CHEROKEE SONG brought up the rear racing in the two path, was gradually maneuvered to the outside from upper
to midstretch until about six wide, made no headway. ESOR cut over to the inside, hitched up to the top twosome at the half mile pole, contended for the top
versus a pair of opponents to the outside, put to a brisk hand ride, went into the stretch and gave out.

INVALUABLE hustled from the gate, crossed to the two path placing FOREVER CHANGED in tight along the inside of SIRENIC just inside six and a half
furlongs remaining, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch and edged away under a drive kept to task. GLASS CEILING brushed at the start by ELEGANT ZIP who broke outwards, chased four to five wide
until angled inside to path and advancing near the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, ran on to
chase the winner home clear of the rest. SIRENIC chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and
weakened while able to preserve the show honors. MRS. S chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths,
cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and kept on through to the finish. DOVEY LOVEY seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four
wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened. FOREVER CHANGED forwardly placed along the
inside, got steadied in tight brushing the rail with six and a half furlongs to run as SIRENIC came inwards as INVALUABLE crossed over to the two path
from the outside, tipped out soon after to chase four wide, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went two to three
wide at the head of the stretch and tired. ELEGANT ZIP a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, broke out at the start brushing GLASS CEILING, chased
six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide into
upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TOPPER T put to a hand ride springing from the gate, sprinted to the front end, got guided in the direction of the two path, zipped along on a
loosely-contested advantage, struck the three-sixteenths marker and was turned loose, responded to stay well in the clear. THE SICARII off a length the
tardiest, was along the rail well before reaching the half mile pole, advanced in a steadfast manner towards the pacesetter during the run around the bend,
got driven two wide entering the stretch, altered course back onto the inside route shortly afterwards, rallied for the place. CLENCH strung out four wide on
the turn, was asked to pick it up on the turn, was still in the same path entering the stretch, failed to keep pace with the top twosome, won the show award.
REED KAN stalked the pace three wide for a half before backing away, then narrowly lost out on third. POPIZAR kept watch on the winner from just off the
inside, got sent out five wide from upper to midlane, made no impact. HONORABLE SERVICE departed the backstretch from the three path, stepped into
the lane as wide, had no offering.

Footnotes
WICKED TRICK four then three wide in pursuit, advanced through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over command near the
quarter pole, cornered four wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive kept busy to the wire. T LOVES A FIGHT chased just off the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. MAD MUNNYS hustled from the gate, chased briefly in the two
path before taking to the inside, came under a drive at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on to just miss for the place
honors. LETMETAKETHISCALL three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing between foes at the five-sixteenths and took over
brief and narrow command inside that station, before being headed at the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and
weakened in the late stages. HONOR UP coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand in the two path until tucked inside nine-sixteenths from home,
came under pressure from a pair through the turn, yielded under light coaxing just inside the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired.
SUNNY RIDGE tossed his head just as the latch was sprung and got away a beat slow, chased three then four wide from the tail of the field, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and was eased through to the finish while trailing throughout.

Footnotes
ASK NEAL cut over to the rail, was put to a hand ride making his way around the bend, angled into path four for clearance in upper stretch, closed in on the
one to catch, got engaged in a duel with the runner up in the final furlong, proved best. SINASHACK remained stationed along the inside route after the field
had been sent off and running, flashed interest late on the bend, issued a rail bid as the half was being completed, out-fought a pair of opponents to its
outside to grab the advantage, gained no respite, now having to take on the top one from the eighth pole onward, yielded, stayed on well but wasn't up to
the task of regaining the lead. BLACK 'N TAN bumped at the start, shifted over to the two path, stalked YEROSILVERBIZ, between rivals on the turn, got
set down for the drive home, stayed in contention for the top for another furlong before weakening en route to the show slot. WE READY made contact with
its next stall neighbor at the break, settled into the three path, chased the pace teamed up with a pair of rivals to the inside, moved out towards path five
early in the stretch, gave way. AWESOME YET AGAIN hand urged on the backstretch, stepped onto the turn from path two towards the back nevertheless,
went five wide into the lane and readily retreated. YEROSILVERBIZ squeezed at the start, assumed the top, cut the pace from the two path, succumbed
under heavy pressure in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole then steadily backed away. TWISTED SUNSET off a length the slowest, fell far back
climbing, completed the run to the finish line, distanced.
