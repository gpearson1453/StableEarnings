RAINDANCE RULES chased clear leader along the rail on the backstretch, entered turn along the rail, eased out to launch bid two wide, overtook leader at
the top of the stretch and cleared in upper stretch, won handily. SON OF A QUEEN tracked leader along the inside, entered turn along the rail and
continued bid along the inside in the stretch, rallied well to get up for second under steady urging. HARPER'S GEM tracked leader two wide on the
backstretch, entered turn two wide, bid three wide late in the turn, unable to match strides with clear leader and edged late for second. LEGALLY GRAY off
slow, and settled well off the pace on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn and split rival at the top of the stretch, kept on well enough in the
stretch to best rest. MOUNTAIN VIEW broke well and sent to a clear lead on the backstretch, maintained clear advantage into the turn, overtaken by winner
at the top of the stretch, kept on in upper stretch and gave way at the sixteenth. DOHENY BEACH settled off the pace two wide on the backstretch, failed to
menace thereafter.
