Footnotes
CLASSIC GREELEY lacked early speed, made a steady gain, was all out down the home stretch and held on for a dead heat win. BINDING void of early
speed, raced wide around the second turn, made a bid, dour wide and was just up. DH. VENN pressed the pace, raced close throughout and proved no
match for the top two. PURIM KING trailed the field in the beginning, moved up wide around the second turn and gained ground willingly down the stretch.
LIAM SKYE raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. HIGH RIDGE raced within contention, eased back, improved position late, but
was no factor. CAJUN CASH dueled for the early lead, drove clear and was finished early. TENSAS TODDY pressed the early pace and dropped back.
WHISKEY'S GONE broke out, challenged for the lead and retreated to the rear.
