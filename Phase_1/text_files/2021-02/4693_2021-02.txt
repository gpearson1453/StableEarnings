Footnotes
FUNNY BONES FLAG along the outside while engaged with QUEENTIGUA during the initial stages, slid over to the rail after edging away from that
opponent, steadily extended the margin during the run around the bend, settled in at the three-sixteenths pole and got asked for more, offered up the
desired response and kicked farther away. CALIDAD the early trailer, got spotted along the inside route approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, was
switched over to a hand ride, flashed some interest after crossing midpoint on the turn, came into the stretch under a drive, angled three wide at the furlong
grounds, went on to dominate the others for the place. QUEENTIGUA towards the inside early while vying with the winner, tipped to that foe's outside
afterwards, kept up its quest for the top until the general area of the five-sixteenths pole and folded. REPEAL AND REPLACE tipped to the outside on the
chute, raced mostly two wide, stepped into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
WICKED TITLE coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive threatening through the length of the stretch and got up in the very last jump to prevail. MICROMILLION coaxed from the start, vied briefly with
a pair before shaking away with five furlongs remaining along the inside, took to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
continued just off the inside for home, dug in under threat stubbornly clinging to the lead until nailed in the very last stride to the finish. MANI PEDI chased
three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. LOTTIE'S MIZZION coaxed from the gate, vied briefly between foes before chasing two to three wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. LA NEGRITA broke out at the start, led early on before briefly
vying for command three paths off the inside, went four wide through the turn and retreated under coaxing from midway, cornered seven wide into upper
stretch and tired. SYZYGY hustled from the start, chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside for home and tired.
PATRONA chased five then four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued five wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MONTAUK TRAFFIC off the inside, pursued the pace from path two for nearly a half, tipped to the outside as the half was being completed in preparation
for the stretch run, took off with good energy when set down in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, narrowly struck the front at the eighth pole, kicked
well clear. MONTAUK DADDY established control in short order, showed the way at or very close to the inside route for the opening half, rated on a
loosely-contested advantage, edged away to lead by his largest margin as the second split was to be posted, got roused coming onto the head of the
stretch, was overpowered by the winner, held on for the place. MERCHANTS OF COOL pocketed while keeping watch on the top one, swung out three
wide into the stretch, got outfinished. PROMO CODE sent over to the rail approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, cut the corner into the stretch being
encouraged, failed to fire. MR PHIL strung out three wide, shifted towards path six in the stretch while tiring. MISSION WRAPITUP two wide and between
rivals until the five-sixteenths pole, gave out.

Footnotes
SARATOGA BEAUTY loped along on the backstretch, departed it from the two path, flashed interest as the half was being completed, maintained it and
closed in on the one to catch, altered course into path three to be outside that foe in midstretch, snatched away the advantage inside the eighth pole and
edged away. STUNNING MUNNINGS strung out four wide on the turn, was towards the same one spinning into the lane, had a good finish down the center
of the strip to procure the place. STEFANIE ON FLEEK rode the rail, cut the corner, mustered up a mild kick sufficient enough to secure the show.
BUYER'S REMORSE vied for the lead towards path two, was asked for more for the drive home, relinquished a little bit beyond the eighth pole, steadily
weakened. ANYDAYISHERDAY tracked the pacesetter from along the inside route for nearly a half, got sent out into path five from upper to midstretch,
lacked the necessary response. BLITCHTON LADY argued for the top three wide for a half before giving way. LEFT LEANING LUCY pursued the pace two
to three wide on the turn, wandered six wide in the lane having never made its presence felt.

Footnotes
TIMED OUT chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn, got set down spinning five wide into
upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command a sixteenth out, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. SHAKER
SHACK broke out at the start under hustling, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from a pair, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
was on near even terms near the quarter pole and swung just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and was
collared a sixteenth from home, ran on well clear of the rest for the place honors. TAP THE BARREL coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until
tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show
honors. SHESADIRTYDANCER prompted the pace from the outside five then four wide, advanced to get on near even terms near the quarter pole, spun
three wide into upper stretch, got placed to brief urging a furlong from home, and weakened to the finish while never appearing fully extended. STYLISH
RAGS four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide
into upper stretch and tired. GUN HILL GIRL broke out at the start bumping INVESTMENT GRADE lightly, chased six then five wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. INVESTMENT GRADE bumped at the start lightly by the aforementioned foe, prompted the
pace three then two wide from between foes coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired.

Footnotes
COLD HARD CASH brushed with RIFT VALLEY at the start, was along the inside route prior to departing the backstretch, tracked the pacesetter from the
pocket, was cued up for the drive home, cut the corner with usable room along the rail corridor, forged to the front during the ensuing furlong, dueled with
TOO EARLY from the eighth pole onward, dug in to preserve the decision. TOO EARLY remained forwardly placed after the field had been released,
pressed the issue towards path three, was still in the same path when the winner came barreling along the rail, stepping into the lane, got beaten to the front
by the rail-hugger, vied with vigour matched up with the top one in the last eighth, wound up denied. MAGNETRON took up position in midpack, travelled
two to three wide on the turn, got sent out into path four for the drive, proved no match. RIFT VALLEY cut over to the inside after making light contact with
COLD HARD CASH in the shadow of the gate, went on to take up the chase venturing onward along the inside route, was under a drive goingr into the
stretch, came up empty. HOLD MY CALL disputed the pace from path two until the head of the stretch before giving out. BAD GUY three wide onto the turn,
commenced the stretch one path wider, had no offering.

Footnotes
JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ chased three then two wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch,
took over command straightened away and edged away under a drive to prevail. IMPERIO D coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing
from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. HAVE A HEART chased two to three wide under coaxing from
the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home, kept on to secure the show honors. OUR AMERICAN STAR chased three paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then five wide through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, went six wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the
finish. TRAPPEZE ARTIST established sole command shortly after vying briefly and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the
turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home and yielded the front straightened away, then weakened in the late stages.
NO MORE MIRACLES chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun three wide for home and tired.
