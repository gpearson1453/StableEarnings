WALK IT OUT NANNY gained an easy, early lead, set the pace near the rail and was under hand urging in the stretch. MOONLIGHT MISS stalked the pace
two wide around the turn, drifted to the three path entering the stretch and was second best. DO I EVER , three deep on the turn, was floated to the four
path turning for home and passed a pair of tired foes. TEMISINA , two wide on the turn, chased the pace to the stretch then tired. BROADWAY TROUPER
hugged the inner rail around the turn and gave way. GRAND ENTRADA trailed.

BRUTUS , rank when a bit unprepared at the break, was bumped and pinched as well to be away last, recovered and edged up between runners into the
backstretch, pulled his way forward and bid three wide outside IRISHTOWN past the five eighths, secured command heading towards the far turn, dropped
in some then was engaged by EMPTY NESTR mid way on the turn, shook clear of that one while under a hearty drive in upper stretch then widened while
kept alert. EMPTY NESTR , three to four wide, ranged up outside the winner to threaten after six furlongs, dueled into the lane, failed to match strides past
the three sixteenths but continued with good energy to the line. INDIAN GHOST tracked the pace while saving ground, bid along the rail past the five
eighths, pressed briefly, saw the leaders get away leaving the three eighths, pursued into the stretch and churned on with some interest. IRISHTOWN vied
outside before going clear into the backstretch, set the pace about two wide, ceded command nearing the half mile marker, chased past the five sixteenths
and faded. SHOTMASTER came out at the break tightening things for the winner, angled out under a drive leaving the far turn but came up empty.

STRETCH THE TRUTH quickly went clear, set a rated pace in the two path, was called upon entering the lane, widened past the furlong marker and was
kept to a steady drive. WHAT THE FLASH , unhurried early, commenced a run while off the rail leaving the far turn, progressed three wide into the lane and
kept on willingly to nab the place. LITTLE BOLD BANDIT had speed to the inside of the winner, tracked two wide leaving the far turn, gave hard chase into
the lane and continued giving effort to the line. ZIP THE LIP , four wide early on while pursuing the winner, shifted in around the turn but came up empty.
FOMO flashed speed three wide while stalking into the turn, failed to keep pace past the three eighths and gave way. CHICO CON ALEX lagged back under
a ride, angled five wide for the drive but failed to respond. ZAGA , off the pace, saved ground leaving the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
CALYPSO GHOST sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and was under brisk urging in the drive. INSTINCTIVE saved ground around the
turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and rallied nicely. SUPER DONNA G lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn, swung to the four
path in upper stretch and offered a mild rally outside rivals. PARCHED GHOST lacked speed, raced along the inner rail most of the trip and had a slight
rally. SPLENDOR GAL , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive. DRIVE IN , two wide on the turn chasing the pace, weakened
the final furlong.

Footnotes
MINESHAFT MAGIC advanced inside rivals and joined the pace fray near the three quarter pole, dueled to the inside of THREATEN around the turn, was
guided to about the three path into the lane, took over heading towards the eighth pole while under a hearty drive, wandered outward while widening then
held sway. BABY MELISSA broke a step slow, recovered and rated off the pace, moved up towards the rail heading to the turn, was stalled around the turn,
found room along the rail in upper stretch and leveled off through the final furlong to close the gap. WRITTENBYTHESTARS , four wide, moved up leaving
the far turn, chased the dueling leaders, kept on willingly past the furlong grounds then flattened out very late. HOT DAME tracked the leaders three wide,
was under coaxing between runners past the three eighths then came up empty. LOVE IS STRONG , off the pace while saving ground, eased out in the
drive and had belated action between rivals. THREATEN got a in a prolonged duel to the outside of the winner past the three quarter pole, held a narrow
advantage past the quarter pole, failed to match strides near the eighth pole then weakened late. TATICA , three wide mid turn, was not a factor. LADY
TIZMO bobbled at the break, chased two wide and tired past the quarter pole.

CONJECTURE bumped FOGGY DREAMS when bumped and forced out by LARIMAR leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path on the turn, swung to
the four path entering the stretch, closed determinedly outside the leader and was up near the finish. PAISLEY SINGING prompted the pace two wide
around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. LE WEEKEND broke alertly and quickly sprinted clear, set a pressured pace
along the inner rail and weakened the final furlong. HIDENSEEK SALLY broke awkwardly, saved ground on the turn, swung out in upper stretch and passed
tired rivals. MAGICAL ANNA , four deep around the turn, chased the pace and gave way. LARIMAR soundly bumped the winner when bearing out at the
break, raced forwardly in the three path between horses on the turn and gave way entering the stretch. GRACE ISABELLA raced along the inner rail most of
the trip and failed to rally. FOGGY DREAMS , bumped and squeezed back leaving the starting gate, circled the turn five deep and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EXTRA MEDIUM , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, gained the lead outside TAPPAHANNOCK inside the three sixteenths pole and edged away.
OUTSIDE THE BOX , lightly bumped leaving the starting gate, was unhurried outside horses down the backstretch, raced four deep on the turn and rallied
outside horses to get the place late. TAPPAHANNOCK sprinted to the early, set the pace along the rail, lost the lead in upper stretch, tried hard but faded
late. PASCAL CHANT , reluctant to load into the starting gate, saved ground around the turn and lacked the necessary late move. KORCZAK , steadied in
close quarters along the rail entering the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. MEO DESPERADO , three deep on the turn,
chased the pace and weakened the final furlong. GATOR FIFTY TWO bore out at the break, raced in the two path on the turn and was never a factor.
MARU'S RAVEN lacked speed, swung to the five path in upper stretch, failed to rally and was being eased late.
