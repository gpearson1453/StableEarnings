lead late and drew clear. LA CAFETERA away alertly, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. TARALLUCCI stalked the pace and
went evenly in the five path. WARRIOR BABY was no factor. SAFFRON GIRL stumbled at the start, chased the pace into the stretch then gave way.

stretch, matched strides with the winner and just missed. RACINROSEMARY stalked the early pace, moved close in the four path on the far turn then came
up empty. PURDY BIRDIE vied for the lead near the inside into the far turn, surged two wide to draw on even terms for the lead before six furlongs then
weakened. SHESMYHEARTANDSOUL away alertly, set the pace into the far turn then tired. NO QUESTION was no factor.

Footnotes
PANAMANIAN TEASER never far back, responded with a burst of speed three wide through deep stretch, made the lead near the sixteenth pole and drew
off. KING OF LIGHT pressed the pace along the inside and finished second best. ONLY ONE WAY BACK broke in front, set the pace until deep stretch then
was outfinished. DIVULGENCE failed to menace. THREE HOMBRES stalked the pace two wide into the stretch then faded. COWTOWN TAPIT swung wide
and was no factor. PLATINUM MAC was bumped at the start, settled with the second flight three wide then lacked the needed response. FATTERTHANME
bore out at the start bumping a rival, was a sharp threat three wide into the stretch then flattened out.

Footnotes
DISTORTEDATTHEBAR allowed to settle, closed fast three wide on the turn and into the stretch, made the lead a furlong out and finished full of run to win
as much the best. DELAYED ENGAGEMENT broke in front, set the pace until mid stretch then was no match for the winner. REDMARK never far back,
finished well inside. THE BOOT WILDCAT stalked the early pace, inched closer on the turn then leveled off. ALYCAR FLASH stalked the pace into the turn,
was in tight approaching the stretch, checked past the quarter pole and lost momentum. JOE CAIN was no threat. BALOTELLI had speed into the turn then
gave way. THE RIDER OF ALYCAR FLASH LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT
THE QUARTER POLE. AFTER REVIEW THESTEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

AMERICAN SOLUTION unhurried for a half, closed steadily on the far turn, shifted out four wide, made the lead in deep stretch and drew clear to win in
hand. EXPRESS BOY made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. TRINNI DANCER
stalked the early pace, rallied three then two wide to make the lead on the far turn, battled until mid stretch and was outfinished. REDS BEST never far
back, finished with good courage five wide. RESTITUTION stalked the pace three wide, bid before a half then leveled off. FINALLY advanced in the middle
of the track on the second turn then came up empty. NAMATH stalked the pace five wide into the far turn and gave way in the stretch. MONEY POINT
showed little. PERFECT PAL pressed the pace for a half, stopped, was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
TIZ ABBY close up from the start, circled rivals four wide on the turn, dueled until deep stretch then finished full of run to win going away. DUNWOODY
dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch, dropped back and angled out to the five path giving up ground, came on again late and got up for
second. WICKED WAYS stalked the early pace, surged between horses three wide on the turn, drew on even terms for the lead, battled until deep stretch
and was outfinished. DARLING BELLE had a mild late rally in the six path. TRINITY GIRL went evenly. YOURS TRULY was outrun. MISS LEGS dueled for
the lead two wide through the turn then was used up. LUCY'S INTEREST had speed along the inside into the turn then stopped.
