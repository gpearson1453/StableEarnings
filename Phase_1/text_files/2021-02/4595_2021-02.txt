Footnotes
NATEALYZE within striking distance, late bid, split rivals down the home stretch and drove clear before the wire. POPS LEGACY lacked early speed, drifted
out around the first turn, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a bid and proved second best. LINDANTE raced near the middle of the field,
steadied around the final turn, blocked, angled out , found running room and finished willingly. SHOOTERS ALLEY pressed the early pace, forwardly placed
throughout and lacked a late rally. GOLD BUYER raced in the middle of the pack, came around the first turn wide and put forth an even effort. DON'T SPLIT
TENS raced near the middle of the field, eased back, improved position, but was no factor. WEKNEWUWERETROUBLE raced in the back, came around
the first turn wide and was never close. MR RED SENSATION vied for the early lead and faded. LEFTFIELDJUNCTION dueled on the front end, saved
ground and dropped back.

turn and was a clear third at the wire. GRAND LITTLE MAN pressed the early pace, weakened and finished evenly. MAJESTIC SOCIETY void of early
speed, raced wide around the final turn and passed tired ones. LUCKY STREAKER dueled on the front end, saved ground and faded. LAST NITE OUT

D'YETI MAN sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task. MALIBU JACK unhurried in the beginning, racing in the back, saved
ground, rallied down the stretch and finished willingly. FRIDAY'S BEST pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a finish. RISKEY
TRICKEY reared at the start, racing in the rear, improved position, but was no threat. MARVELOUS RED raced within contention and faded on the inside.
ONE PROUD BOY raced near the back and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SKYKAT vied for the early lead, drove clear around the final turn, pulled away and proved much the best. WILL B LATE raced in the middle of the field,
came around the final turn on the outside, made a rally, racing four wide, proved no match for the winner, but a clear second. SHE'S A FAIR CATCH raced
in the middle of the field, made a late bid and proved no match for the top two. THINKING OF HER lacked early speed, made a late gain and was
outfinished for third. PRIMARY FIRST pressed the early pace and weakened down the home stretch. PRUD AS PUNCH void of early speed, finished wide,
moved up, but was no factor. JEWELED CROWN dueled for the early advantage and faded. RIVER RAIN blew the first turn, raced in the back and was
never a threat. MISSGREELEY'SSONG raced wide around the first turn and was always near the back. ROSE CROWN challenged for the early lead and
stopped.

REACH THE CIRCLE vied for the early lead, dueled throughout and prevailed for the win. HAIL STATE challenged for the early lead, dueled to the wire,
was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. BROADWAY JONES raced within contention, came around the turn four wide, made a bid, proved no
match for the top two, but held on for the show. SMILING SONG void of early speed, raced five around the turn, rallied down the lane and missed third.
SEELEY raced in back of the field and was never a factor. LAST APPEAL pressed the early pace, steadied entering the turn, lacked running room and
faded. TACTICAL PRIORITY lacked early speed and showed little.

of the field, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner and was just up for second. CLASSY'S FAST ROY lacked early speed, raced wide around the
second turn, made a late gain and missed place. COCO'S MAN pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a finish. BIG BAND'S
LUCK sprinted to the front, drove clear, moved to the rail and was finished early. CHEVEYO broke out, raced near the middle of the pack, gained ground,
steadied down the home stretch, getting in tight quarters on the rail and faded. MY HARVEY had an awkward start, unprepared, raced in the rear and was
never a threat. CRESCENT CITY STAR broke in bumped rival, vied for the early advantage and made a steady retreat. CYBER GUN bumped both sides at
the break and was never close.
