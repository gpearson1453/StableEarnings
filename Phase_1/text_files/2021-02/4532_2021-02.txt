Footnotes
KANTSTAROS pressed two wide, assumed command from the pace setter passing the three furlong marker, quickly widened in hand turning for home,
opened up to an insurmountable lead under driving pressure from the three sixteenths pole to the furlong grounds, then was wrapped up through the late
stages. CARROBIO tracked from midpack along the inside, failed to keep pace into the turn, but saved ground around the bend, smoothly improved inside
of rivals turning for home to claim place, and proved second best. GODS PROMISE took a bump from an inner rival into an outer foe shortly after the start,
lied well off of the pace in the two path into the turn, swung to the six path turning for home, and improved position without threatening.
READTHETRANSCRIPT lied far off of the pace three wide, split foes to forge show in upper stretch, but got outfinished for that position. DIVERT was
fractious in the gate, got forced out mildly at the start causing him to bump a rival shortly after, then lied far off of the pace along the inside, altered to the five
path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. NEPOMUCENO set the pace inside of the eventual winner down the backstretch, but proved no match for that foe
passing the three furlong pole, and weakened turning for home. COMPASS CAY got fractious in the gate, then was crowded a bit at the start before
receiving a bump from an inner foe, then lagged well behind, was outrun throughout, and showed little. BOTTOM DECK chased the leaders from the three
path, but weakened while drifting to the four path at the three sixteenths marker.

Footnotes
FITZ'S MO dueled inside of DROPPED ANCHOR while racing in the two path, dug in inside and prevailed. DROPPED ANCHOR dueled outside of the
winner in the three path, was clearly in front turning for home but was outfinished. PERUVIAN DANCER stalked the duel from the rail, angled four wide near
the five-sixteenths pole, had dead aim through the lane, slowly gained but could not pass either foe. HICKERSON went evenly two wide. EL SICARIO
chased the pace inside, had no response and was eased in the lane. FREEZE TURKEY chased the pace four wide, dropped back and drifted out nearing
the lane and was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
INFATUATING prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole sparking a duel, battled with his inner counterpart through the lane,
but prevailed in the late stages. LYRICAL set the pace along the inside, dug in inside of INFATUATING as that horse bid passing the five sixteenths pole,
sustained the duel through the lane, but was bested approaching the wire. STRONG AZTECA chased the leaders from along the inside, but failed to keep
pace with them in upper stretch. FEARLESS IDEAS slightly bobbled, but was jostled significantly between horses at the start, then was outrun along the
inside. LUISANA PRINCESS weakened into the turn, then was pulled up turning for home, and vanned off. PINK FIZZ stumbled at the start and lost her
rider, then walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

NITRO TIME sped to the front, set the pace along the rail and held firm under a drive. ETCHED IN STONE settled off the pace while racing two and three
wide, rallied through the lane while drifting out a bit under steady left-handed urging but could not quite reel in the winner. MR TINGLES stalked the winner
two wide and was one-paced in the lane. NO QUE NO steadied soon after the start, saved ground off the pace and had a mild stretch gain while outkicked.
HIGHWAY BOUND saved ground, angled out in upper stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
MARKISTAN hopped at the start, lied far off of the pace two wide before swinging six wide turning for home, then rallied through the lane to drive past the
leaders inside the final sixteenth, and drew clear. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL dueled for the lead two wide, then from between horses after SALSA RITA bid for
the lead at the three furlong pole, got headed by that foe turning for home, but dug in to repel that rival and reclaim an advantage passing the furlong
marker, but was surpassed by MARKISTAN inside the sixteenth pole. BAHAMIAN GIRL tracked from midpack four wide, got floated five wide at the quarter
pole, but sustained chasing position through upper stretch to bid for the lead passing the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by MARKISTAN at the
sixteenth pole, and leveled off. SALSA RITA pressed three wide, bid for the lead passing the three furlong marker, dueled outside of a pair of foes around
the turn, forged a brief advantage in upper stretch, but tired between horses passing the furlong pole. UNCAPTURED RUBY vied along the inside early on,
but chased outer foes after a furlong and a half, saved ground before shifting three wide turning for home, but lacked a kick to split foes in upper stretch,
then chased evenly through the lane to just miss reaching fourth. WORTH AVENUE lied off of the pace three wide, shifted five wide at the five sixteenths
pole before being floated seven wide in upper stretch, then improved mildly outside of foes through the lane to just miss reaching fourth. SUNSET EMPIRE
dueled inside of a pair of foes through the turn, but yielded through the final furlong. SUBSIDIARY was off slowly and lied off of the pace along the inside
early on, got rank briefly from rider correction when steered two wide into the turn, tracked from midpack and between horses around the bend before
shifting three to four wide at the quarter pole, but lacked a further kick to produce a bid, and faded in upper stretch. SOCIALLY ASTRAY saved ground at
the rear of the field, and never got involved.

Footnotes
CODRINGTON rated off of the pace along the inside, shifted off of the rail into the backstretch, improved to track from midpack two wide while in hand
around the far turn, then smoothly split foes in upper stretch as the leader drifted giving him ample racing room, bid for the lead outside of NYMUE'S
TREASURE approaching the furlong grounds, dueled outside of that foe while unable to kick away, and forged an advantage approaching the wire.
NYMUE'S TREASURE lied forwardly placed while shifting three to two wide around the first turn, tucked to the rail into the far turn, inherited an advantage
straightening into the lane as the leader drifted out and floated other foes with her, but was confronted by CODRINGTON approaching the furlong grounds,
dueled inside of that foe through the lane, but was bested late. BLOSSOM BOW saved ground from midpack, hugged the fence turning for home, achieved
show passing the furlong pole while failing to keep pace with the leaders, and held that position to the wire. INTEREST lied off of the pace two to three wide
around the turns, swung to the seven path turning for home to be outside of rivals, and improved to just reach a minor placing. LILLIE'S HEAT set the pace
along the inside, but did not corner well straightening into the late, drifted to the four path and floated a pair of pressing rivals with her, got headed in the
process, and tired thereafter. QUEEN FIELD trailed, took the far turn in the two to four path, and failed to factor. SOMETHING MAGICAL lied forwardly
placed four to three wide around the first turn, but got floated six wide straightening into the lane, and weakened in upper stretch. OBLIO'S WISH pressed
the leader two wide, came under a drive into the far turn, held position around that bend, but was floated to the five path entering the lane, and weakened in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
R ADIOS JERSEY broke a bit slowly, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid two wide around the turn, reached even terms near the five-sixteenths
pole, dueled two wide from there to the sixteenth marker then drove clear. FOOLISH HEART broke sharply, sped to the front, set the pace along the rail,
dug in inside of the winner from the five-sixteenths to the sixteenth pole but was no match late. TO A T saved ground off the pace, angled three wide in
upper stretch and rallied for the show. INCLUDE THE BEAST chased the top two finishers two wide and lacked a rally. BATTLE CRY lagged inside, swung
out in upper stretch and improved position. DEM A WONDER had some speed three wide but steadily faded. LILAC LACE broke out and bumped SPLASH
CASH at the start and played no further factor while racing two wide. SPLASH CASH was bumped at the start, raced three wide and was outrun.

Footnotes
LAKE AVENUE was off a step slowly and got slightly pinched at the start, lied off of the pace four wide, commenced a rally while shifting three wide at the
three furlong pole, steadily advanced around the turn and through upper stretch to bid for the lead passing the furlong marker, then drew off before being
wrapped up approaching the wire. DANCE D'ORO set the pace along the inside, drew clear of a pressing foe into the turn, held a clear margin through
upper stretch, but was headed by LAKE AVENUE inside the final furlong, and gave way passing the sixteenth marker. CRUMB BUN tracked from midpack
along the inside early on, advanced inside of foes to secure a stalking position approaching the five furlong pole, but was shuffled back to midpack behind
SONAR passing the three furlong marker, shifted three wide turning for home, then split rivals and stayed on to achieve show. HOPEFUL GROWTH lied
forwardly placed two wide, retreated to midpack into the turn, got outmoved by the eventual winner around the bend, shifted four wide to be outside of foes
turning for home, delayed her lead change until the furlong grounds, but stayed on after doing so and just reached fourth. FINDING FAME lied forwardly
placed three wide, then two wide at the three furlong pole, chased the leader turning for home, but was outkicked by the eventual winner at the three
sixteenths pole, and faded in the final furlong. SONAR prompted the pace setter two wide while under a snug hold down the backstretch, but failed to keep
pace with that foe into the turn, shifted to the rail at the three furlong pole under urging, chase the clear leader through the turn, then faded in upper stretch.
VELVET CRUSH hesitated significantly at the start, lied far off of the pace two wide, and never got involved. NOMIZAR was outrun along the inside.

pole but was reeled in by the winner late and then bumped by that foe very late. SIMPLY THE BEST pressed the pace two wide around the first turn, drew
clear and angled in nearing the far turn, led to upper stretch, vied past the eighth pole, weakened and lasted for a share of the show. SYSTEMATIC veered
out at the start, raced off the pace three wide and had a mild rally for a slice of the show. BELLE'S KINGDOM hit the starting gate, saved ground off the
pace, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. KHOSEA was outrun while racing two wide. CHIPS AND SALSA prompted the pace three
wide and was through after a half. DIVINE ENCOUNTER set the early pace along the rail, yielded nearing the far turn, checked entering the turn and
retreated.
