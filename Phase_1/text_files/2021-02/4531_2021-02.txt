reserve, was asked in the three path outside the three-eighths, accelerated quickly while shifting four then five wide late on that bend, closed strongly to get
the lead inside the three-sixteenths, drew clear under the whip while still on her inside lead into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand ride to the
wire while much the best. JUANANDORA went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the two
to three path on the far turn, took the lead coming to the three-sixteenths then lost the advantage to the winner and proved no match while well clear for the
place. STAR'S DREAM broke out and bumped with a foe, went around the first turn in the two path under restraint, became rank late on that bend under a
vigorous hold, was rated off the pace, came under urging at the seven-sixteenths, chased in the two path on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the
whip and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. SMART PEGASUS bumped with a rival at the start, was taken up between horses early, went
three wide while keen behind horses early on the first turn then settled more kindly after dropping to the two path, settled comfortably down the backstretch,
was asked in the two path early on the far turn then roused for more when the winner blew by her at he five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive in upper
stretch, drifted out under a left-handed whip at the furlong marker then switched to a right-handed whip and came up empty. MEG AND CLAIR moved out
into the first turn, went three to four wide on that bend, settled off the pace, dropped back while rider tried to switch goggles leaving the backstretch, went
four then five wide on the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch and failed to respond. LIL' SISTER LOU brushed with the winner while breaking in front and
coming in a bit then was hustled, set the pace while well rated on the inside, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the lead nearing the three-sixteenths and
faded. SUPERSPORT SALLY went four to five wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, raced five wide under urging early on the far turn,
dropped to the three path around the five-sixteenths then the rail outside the quarter-pole and had nothing left. WASNT JOKING broke out at the start, went
four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back four wide under urging on the far turn and retreated.

SPECTROLITE bumped soundly with a rival at the start and was off a step slow, moved up to take the lead, showed the way in the two path through the
turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, extended the advantage under the whip into the final furlong and held under steady urging. CORRUZE
bumped soundly with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, raced inside of a foe in the three path on the turn, was put to the whip in upper
stretch, gained into the final sixteenth and finished with good courage for the place. MORE ABUNDANCE settled towards the rear, went three to four wide
on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch, gained on the outside into the final sixteenth and finished with good energy for the show. ABOUT OUR TIME
dropped back while crowded against the rail early then settled off the inside, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, lacked
room when a foe came in near the three-sixteenths, hesitated to go through an opening until the furlong marker then was roused at that point, altered out
from behind horses around the sixteenth-pole and was gaining but belatedly on the scene. JAKE THE BAND MAN showed good speed then tracked the
pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, lugged inward in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. THE GRAY
BLUR was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, dropped back along the rail on the turn, turned into upper stretch under the whip and lacked
the needed response. MR. PRIORITY broke awkwardly and was off a few of lengths behind the front, was coaxed along at the rear, moved in late on the
backstretch, went three wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch then moved further out around the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten.
IMPEACHABLEOFFENSE settled on the outside, was asked four wide on the turn then came five wide into the stretch under the whip, drifted in
approaching the three-sixteenths and failed to respond. (Rail at 26 Feet)

the quarter-pole then took a short lead in upper stretch, dueled outside of the winner, brushed with that foe inside the furlong marker then lost the
advantage, fought on to the wire but missed and was denied the place on the wire but clear for the show. ULTIMATE IRONY was taken in hand early,
rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved in the middle of the field, went three then four wide while let out on the far turn, gained to make a five
wide bid into the stretch then came out a path, dropped back into the final furlong and was out-kicked. O DOGG broke in and bumped with a foe, saved
ground on the first turn, was rated in third position, moved closer while two then three wide on the far turn, made a four wide bid at the quarter-pole, dropped

Footnotes
BYE BYE BERTIE quickly sped clear, dropped from three to two wide on the turn, drew off to a sizable advantage on the backstretch, remained clear while
inside through the far turn, responded well under the whip in upper stretch and proved much the best under strong urging. QUEEN OF THE LANE went
three wide for most of the first turn then dropped to the two path, settled under some urging, raced inside early on the far turn then shifted to the two path
while moving closer at the five-sixteenths, chased the winner into upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. SWEET BLINDNESS went
three then two wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer in the two path on the far turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and lacked the
needed response while well clear for the show. PRINCESA BLANCA angled in at the rear, went around both turns in the two path and failed to threaten.
POP A CHOC rounded the first turn in the two then three path, settled on the outside, moved closer while ridden along in the four path on the far turn, was
driven five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. SKYVALUE was hustled from the start, went two then three wide on the first turn, followed the solo
leader from second, was urged three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.
