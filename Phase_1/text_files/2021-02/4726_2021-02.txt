EIGHTS WILD showed good early speed to set all the pace, raced three wide in the lane and held gamely to be clear under strong pressure.
STICKINWITHTHEGUYS pressed the early leader from the inside and finished second best. CHUCKMATE was allowed to settle early on, moved up five
wide into the upper stretch and made a mild late gain. PENCE was unhurried early, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no late response. VICTORY
ROSE was slow in the early stages and never threatened. ALL TRUMPED UP showed brief early foot down to the first turn and was pulled up. All Trumped
Up walked off the track under his own power. Official race time was hand timed.

GO GO SAMS BRO was quick to begin to set all the pace and was well clear under strong handling. DIRTY DEEDS raced up close in the early stages,
raced towards the inside and was no match for the winner. RUN FOR MATTY dropped back early, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and showed good
late interest. COUNTRY BOY CHARM stalked the pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had not enough. PREACHER settled off the early pace,
raced along the inside and had no response. READY OR NOT was hustled from the outside, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.
FIST showed little. MIDNIGHT LEWIS settled towards the back of the pack early on and failed to respond.

raced in the three path and weakened in the latter stages. PIERPONT stalked the leaders from the inside and had no response. CREAKY CRICKET was
slow early, raced five deep into the upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
SYLVIA'S ROCKET set all the pace while racing just off the inside down the backstretch and held gamely to prevail under all out pressure.
DREAMINGNDIAMONDS stalked the pace from the outside, raced four deep through the lane and finished second best. ALWAYS A TIZ stalked early on,
moved up five wide at the eighth pole and had no final winning bid. TSURUOKA was hustled along, raced towards the inside through the stretch and had
not enough. LILFEATHEREDINDIAN dropped back early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. SYDNEY ELIZABETH was off very
slow, raced four deep and never threatened. RHINE FALLS was hustled along from the inside and tired. ABLE CATCH failed to menace. The three eighths
internal fraction was unavailable.
