ENVY was unhurried to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch while rallying, pushed to the front in mid stretch and held driving. THAT'S MY STORY
chased the leaders early, was two wide to the stretch but was outrun to mid stretch then kept to task to easily get the place. MAY SONG stalked to the turn,
was three wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. CELLAR DOOR dueled outside PEGGY SLEW, inched away off the rail on
the turn but was collared in upper stretch and gave way. PEGGY SLEW contested the pace inside of CELLAR DOOR but was outrun by that one to the
stretch and also gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
CROWN KITTEN pressed LADY CHROME three wide to the stretch, responded when roused, collared that one leaving the furlong grounds and edged
away driving. LADY CHROME set the pace while racing off the rail, eased out a bit further into the lane, responded to mid stretch then could not stall the
winner. NAMORITA was outrun to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. ZELAIA tracked the leader early, was three
wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. I LOVE ROMANCE was chasing to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive.
AMBER LOUISE got outsprinted while inside rivals, checked when in a bit tight nearing the turn then saved ground to no avail.

LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH broke in stride, gained control of moderate pace, saved ground to the stretch and held under steady urging. SATANTA raced
mid-pack, angled outside and put in a bold rally to nab second. ARNO'S MANE MAN was away slowly, raced at the back of the field, mounted a late charge,
just missing the place. DICTION broke sharply, took back behind a moderate pace and was outrun. MISSED THE BOAT broke evenly, maintained a middle
position but weakened in mid stretch. STUDLY PERFECTION broke in the air, chased pace setting rivals, made a three wide move then did not rally.

DO YOU HEAR THAT was chasing the pace to the turn, got fanned out four deep to the stretch but rallied determinedly in the final furlong and prevailed.
GAYLES EVENING was on the pace from the outset, raced two wide to the stretch then dug in willingly despite not switching leads but could not stall the
winner. SILK ROAD SALLY had no speed, was forced to circle five wide to the stretch and could not impact the top two. EMMA'S DANCE attended the pace
outside the runnerup and three wide, got outkicked to mid stretch then weakened. PARTY SPIRIT (GB) broke slowly then hurried to chase the pace inside,
shifted off the rail into the stretch but lacked a closing response.

MISTER BOLD attended the pace between rivals, dueled two wide to the stretch, was headed by BIG DUKE in mid stretch but dug in gamely to get the nod.
BIG DUKE attended the pace outside two others, responded to take a short lead to mid stretch but could not shake loose, battled but just missed.
CRISTIANO'S DREAM chased the leaders three wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. RAGING WATERS was pinched back
shortly after the start, had no speed, raced four wide on the turn but was not a factor in the drive. WINDY CITY RED had no speed and saved ground to no
avail. CORSICAN hustled to contest the pace inside, was outrun on the turn and stopped in the stretch.
