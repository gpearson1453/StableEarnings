Footnotes
IMAGOODCHATTERBUG settled off the early pace inside, moved to even terms approaching the three eighths pole, dueled from that point and contested
the rail on the far turn, then dug in under steady encouragement to hold off the game effort of UPSY DAISY DO, who settled off the early pace about the
three path then closed to the lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole, dueled mostly at even terms from that point, contested the far turn two deep and
dug in gamely through the lane, though, relented later yards. LADY MADISON raced off the earlier pace in the three and four paths, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and came through the far turn about the three path, then finished evenly. ESTHER'S FORTUNE saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn then flattened stride. BLAZING BOURBON came away slowly and was never a factor. KIM'S
PET broke sharply and drew off to a long early lead, but gave way after a half mile.

Footnotes
VIVE EL MOMENTO took immediate control to rate a slim lead inside then came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest
the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold off ONE SMART COOKIE, who stalked the early pace then challenged nearing the
three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, drifted a bit into the stretch but dug in under steady urging while slowly
gaining later strides. KEYED UP stalked in the four path the first turn then challenged three wide nearing the three eighths pole, but dropped back past the
quarter, drifted to the five path nearing the head of the lane and flattened stride, though, held on for third. CLASSY ESCORT rated close to the early pace
inside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then eased outward on the far turn, entered the stretch about the six path and was gaining on third.
COWGIRL NIGHT settled off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, came
through the far turn in the three path then weakened. POETS PRINCESS rounded the first turn in the four path then raced outside into the backstretch,
though, saved ground on the far turn.

CITY PRINCESS angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure into the far turn and raced at the rail through the turn, then dug in under
steady handling to hold on well. SHE'S RIGHT settled off the pace and off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the
three path, then dug in down the lane to take second the final yards. QUICK ENERGY stalked off the rail the opening turn then gave chase into the
backstretch, rounded the far turn just off the rail and flattened stride the final sixteenth. RUN ON ENERGY saved ground racing well back from early
contention, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, but showed little further. LADY'S CORK raced off the early pace in
the three and four paths, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the four path of the far turn. CANDYFORACAUSE was pulled up
shortly after the start and walked off post race.

handled through the lane. CREATIVE SPLENDOR stalked in the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the
rail then dueled through the stretch for second. SING FROSTY settled off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn, picked up the chase toward the
five sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. PARTLY DANDY rounded the opening
turn about the four path and settled off the pace toward the outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the
far turn and showed little further. ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY broke outward to make contact with Red Hot Cookie, was steadied into the first turn and raced
hemmed in through the turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, ran in the three path most of the far turn but angled to the five path toward the head of
the lane and showed little more. THREE AFFAIRS broke in to make contact with Red Hot Cookie while bumped off stride, rated close off the rail early on,
picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. ITSI BITSI settled back in the two and three paths the first turn
and showed no response through the backstretch. RED HOT COOKIE was bumped outward and into Three Affairs leaving the gate then pinched back,
