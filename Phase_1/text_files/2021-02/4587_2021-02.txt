Footnotes
JAN JAN CAN settled off the pace, went four wide around the turn, rallied from outside and proved best in the final sixteenth. RANEEM broke in and
brushed inner rival, was closest in pursuit early, bid outside around the bend, led in upper stretch and yielded to the winner in deep stretch. FULL ECLIPSE
brushed leaving the gate, stalked along the inside, tipped out in the stretch and was along for the show. PASITO stalked three wide into and around the turn
and never produced the needed bid. JUMPING JILL FLASH set the pace up the backstretch, led a bit off the rail into the turn, was pressured by RANEEM
around the turn, fought back into the drive, lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened. REALREALGOOD lacked early speed, went three wide around the
turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
BLEU BALLON sped to the front, cleared early and set the pace up the backstretch, inched away in upper stretch and remained clear under a few taps
right-handed urging and steady handling late. LADY MACARENA chased the speed from inside through the turn, moved off the rail in the stretch and held
the place. VELVET stalked off the rail, went three then four wide around the turn, finished willingly alongside the runner-up but could not get by for the place.
SHVERE ARBETER tracked from inside early, raced a bit off the rail into the drive and finished evenly in the final furlong. BOWL OF CHERRIES raced off
the pace along the inside, cut the corner into the stretch, angled out and kept on to improved position. QUEEN OF ARENDELL steadied off heels at the
start, went two wide into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DAMN THE TORPEDOES hesitated at the start,
angled out and went outside a rival on the backstretch, entered the lane three wide and proved no menace. K P KAN DO chased behind the leader and
outside a rival two wide to the stretch and flattened in the final furlong. MALIBU HANNAH was in range early off the inside, traveled two then three wide
around the bend and faded. JAXONS TOUR GUIDE raced near or at the back of the pack early and was steered toward the inside, was along the rail into
the turn then two wide exiting the bend and never threatened. XMAS SURPRISE tracked the lone leader widest up the backstretch, took the turn four wide
and had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
HONORING MAJOR went six then five wide around the first turn, stalked the top pair from outside, bid alongside the leader at the three-eighths, dueled
around the turn and into the stretch, gained command at the eighth pole, put away inside rival then lasted over the late bid from the runner-up. KENZOU'S
RHYTHM bumped leaving the gate, stalked off the inside then chased three wide into the stretch, put in a late bid in the final sixteenth but was not enough.
OUTLAW bumped leaving the gate, dueled for the lead outside a rival, cleared that foe at the three-eighths then met the bid from HONORING MAJOR
around the turn, fought back through the bend and into the stretch, lost command at with a furlong to go but stayed on from inside then yielded in the final
sixteenth. FLIP THE COIN JAN angled to the rail around the clubhouse turn, closed in up the inside then shifted out a path, chased two then three wide into
the drive and lacked the needed bid. IMPRESSION tracked off the rail, went four wide into the stretch and never rallied. BITTER RING HOME sent from the
rail position, dueled for the lead from inside to the three-eighths pole, could not match strides around the far turn and faded. SUPER CLASSIC lagged well
behind the field early, traveled two then three wide around the far turn and never made an impact. SHANE ZAIN raced five then four wide around the first
turn, chased wide while outside a rival on the backstretch, came five wide into the stretch and had nothing left for the drive.

Footnotes
SAPPHIRE KID in range up the backstretch, took the turn three wide, rallied four wide in the drive and got up. GREG'S DIVA sped to the front, led clear to
the sixteenth pole under left-handed urging and got caught late. OVER ATTRACTED tracked two wide to the stretch, finished well between rivals late and
proved a game third. ALL QUALITY was off a bit slow to begin, unhurried in the early going, angled to the inside, shifted to the two path around the turn,
angled out in the stretch and showed a mild response to earn a minor award. MAGICAL GRAY stalked outside a rival, raced in the two path through the turn
then three wide in the drive and lacked the needed late kick. MISS LUCY (IRE) stalked the pace from inside and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
DREAM SHAKE sat off the pace early, ranged up four wide around the turn, took over into the stretch, kicked clear and drew off under some right-handed
urging and was in hand nearing the wire. HARBORED MEMORIES broke in and bumped rival at the start, chased two wide into the turn, angled four wide
leaving the bend, rallied and was clearly second best. MR. IMPOSSIBLE stumbled and got knocked into inside rival at the start, pressed the pace from
inside, vied for command on the turn and led past the five-sixteenths, was overtaken into the stretch and flattened to third. LONE SCOUT off slow early,
trailed the field early, went three wide around the turn, came out at the top of the lane and showed a mild response. CHAOS REIGNS raced off the pace
early, took the turn two wide and went between rivals, asked in the drive but lacked a rally. DESERVEDLY bumped at the start, traveled along the inside,
lacked room behind a pair of rivals into the stretch and could not rally after angling out. BEZOS was up close early outside the top pair, bid three deep
around the turn and faded in the stretch. LAW PROFESSOR tracked the leaders three to four wide through the bend and weakened. TIVOLI TWIRL set the
pace under pressure from inside, vied between rivals around the bend, could not keep pace at the quarter pole and tired in the late stages.

EDGEWAY broke in and brushed rival leaving the gate, stalked the pace from outside, went three then two wide into the stretch, moved out a bit and drew
alongside the leader at the top of the lane, struck the front nearing the eighth pole and drew away under hand urging. ACTING OUT set the pace with
QUALITY RESPONSE to the outside, cleared that rival at the five-sixteenths pole, was challenged by the winner in upper stretch, could not match strides in
the final furlong while drifting out but was clearly second best. MISS BIGLY tracked the pace off the inside, went four wide through the turn and bested the
rest. QUALITY RESPONSE was off a bit slow to begin, pressed the leader from outside, chased two wide past the five-sixteenths pole and weakened.
HOTITUDE brushed from outside at the start, stalked a bit off the rail then angled three wide into the stretch and also weakened.

Footnotes
ZIPPER MISCHIEF raced mid-pack up the backstretch, took the turn two wide, angled out into the lane, got bumped by the runner-up in upper stretch,
drifted in past the eight pole and drew clear late. HAMMERING LEMON stalked three to four wide around the turn, moved out into the stretch, drifted in and
bumped the winner in upper stretch, rallied and finished a game second. BRIX brushed leaving the gate, angled to the inside, saved ground to the stretch,
rallied between rivals but was outkicked by the top pair. MASTER RYAN dueled for the lead from outside, led clear at the eighth pole, yielded with a
sixteenth to go and bumped rival nearing the wire. HANDSOME CAT stalked two wide around the turn, came four wide into the stretch, was put in tight
quarters at the eighth pole and got bumped by rival nearing the wire. EUSTACE traveled off the pace early on, went three to four wide around the turn,
came out into the stretch and produced a mild rally. SHADY EMPIRE showed early speed outside the dueling pair, chased three wide around the turn, was
in tight and steadied past the eighth pole and could not regain momentum. SINGLE ME OUT brushed leaving the gate, took the turn two wide, looked to
rally in the furlong grounds but lacked room late. FIRST PREZ trailed the field early, went two then three wide around the turn and never threatened. HIT
THE SEAM dueled for the lead from inside to the eighth pole and weakened in the final furlong. COLT FICTION tracked off the inside, went four wide into
the turn, was floated out by rival into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
