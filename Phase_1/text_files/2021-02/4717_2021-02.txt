Footnotes
MAGICALCHIC broke in and bumped rival twice at the start, tracked leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch in
between rivals and into the four path, closed best on tiring rival to win well. WAY TOO SWEET bumped by outside rival twice at the start, found a tracking
position along the rail on the backstretch, continued saving ground through the turn and into the stretch, gamely kept on inside and finished second best
being outclosed by outside rival. THE PET pressed leader along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the rail on the turn and into the stretch in the
two path, outclosed by rivals in the stretch and saved show. MADAME JEANETTE tracked leader three wide on the backstretch, entered turn three wide
and into the stretch in the four path, drifted out steadily in the stretch ending up in the seven path, and edged out for third. SLIGHTLY settled well off the
pace on the backstretch, continued at the back of the pack on the turn, asked for run late in the turn and into the stretch, responded well and made up good
ground late. SIX EIGHTEEN led two wide on the backstretch, cleared rival heading into the turn, shook free from rivals midway through the turn, responded
to urging in upper stretch and stopped to a crawl inside the sixteenth pole.

BADGER broke well and cleared rivals quickly on the backstretch, entered turn clear and opened up through the turn, entered stretch well clear and under a
mild drive. SKY GLORY a bit antsy in the gate, tracked leader along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, angled out three
wide entering the stretch and battled through the stretch to earn second. CHIEF EAGLE EYE broke in, bumped rival at the start, chased clear leader two
wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, battled in the stretch for second and was outfinished. TIGER ON YOUR SIX stalked leader along the inside,
continued to save ground on the turn, angled out into the stretch, beat to the spot by SKY GLORY and had to wait briefly, kept on in the stretch and bested
rest. HOSS CARTWRIGHT broke well and chased leader along the rail, entered turn along the inside, drifted out and had to take up approaching the eighth
pole, and came up empty in the stretch. SUPER TONY bumped by outside rival at the start, stalked leader two wide on the backstretch and failed to launch
a bid thereafter.
