Footnotes
ONEMORETIMEAROUND tracked outside BACH for six furlongs, took over readily in upper stretch and drove clear. PUGIN was never far back, ranged up
three wide to loom a threat nearing the quarter-pole, could not kick with the winner and settled for second best. MY MAXAMILLION saved ground under a
firm hold behind the early leaders, moved off the rail into the stretch and could only gain mildly. KICKS ON SIXTY SIX settled in the middle of the field two to
three wide, and had no closing response. BACH crossed over inside with the early lead, set an easy pace, and yielded to the winner turning for home.
GREENWOOD DRIVE failed to become a factor toward the inside. FITZ'S MO broke through the gate prior to the start, reloaded without further incident,
and was never prominent. CUATE raced three wide early, and made no impact. PHAROAH'S GOLD was outrun inside.

Footnotes
TWO PRINCES was shut off and appeared to clip heels at the start, dropped well back inside, rallied along the rail around the far turn, got through inside of
the pacesetter in upper stretch, seized command leaving the eighth pole and drew off under a drive. MUTARAAFEQ disputed the pace inside of foes, edged
clear nearing the turn, set the pace inside around the turn, drifted slightly into the two path turning for home, was collared by the winner leaving the eighth
pole but stayed on to be clearly second best. ULTIMATE GIFT veered out at the start and appeared to get clipped behind by the winner, disputed the pace
two wide down the backstretch, stalked two wide around the turn and weakened in the lane. BRETT'S WORLD was in range four wide and lacked a closing
bid. MACHO REAL stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. AMERICAN GREAT broke outwardly and slowly, raced two and three wide
and made little impact. CRACKER BOX PALACE chased the pace two wide, had no response and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
DEVOTED KITTEN bumped with LONG GRAY LINE at the start, raced out in the four-path most of the way, rallied to take over outside POWERFUL ALLY
at the top of the stretch and drove clear under pressure. LONG GRAY LINE bumped with DEVOTED KITTEN at the start, swung five wide leaving the far
turn, and rallied to be clearly second best. MOZO BELLO saved ground to the far turn, came widest for the drive and offered a mild response.
TEXTPECTATION was outrun for six furlongs, and passed tired horses along the rail. AYCAPOTE vied early inside STARSHIP ARAMIS, and gave way on
the far turn. STARSHIP ARAMIS contested the pace outside AYCAPOTE, and tired after six furlongs. POWERFUL ALLY eyed the battling leaders up the
backstretch, rallied to the front between horses midway on the far turn, but weakened into the lane.

Footnotes
TALKING BOOK was unhurried while saving ground early, edged closer three wide around the far turn, came five wide into the lane, closed determinedly
and was up in the final strides. COASTANA settled two wide in midpack, went three wide around the far turn, rallied between rivals, took the lead in deep
stretch but could not quite hold off the winner. KATAMA MOONLIGHT set a clear pace in the two path, drew off in upper stretch, led to deep stretch but
could not withstand the top two in the later yards. RED LIGHT RACER saved ground off the pace, swung widest in upper stretch and rallied belatedly.
OCEAN AIR tracked the pace inside and lacked the needed rally. HONOR HOP saved ground and never threatened. SPUNGIE stalked the pace two wide
and came up empty in the lane. SAINT LUCIE (GB) trailed in the two path and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
AUDREY advanced four wide around the turn, caught PEACHY QUEEN from outside entering the final furlong and drove clear. PEACHY QUEEN rallied
three wide around the turn, took over outside CORINTHIA and CAVE CREEK coming to the three-sixteenths, shifted to the rail and yielded grudgingly past
the eighth-pole. NAVAL WAVE moved out four wide improving position after three-eighths of a mile, and finished evenly. OKALANI lagged well back early,
circled six wide and went by tired horses. DANCE FOR THE SUN shifted out five wide approaching the stretch, and lacked a solid bid. FACTS ONLY
unseated the rider and ran off down the chute prior to the start, was apprehended and loaded reluctantly, raced three to four wide and posed no threat.
CORINTHIA set the pace inside, and weakened once displaced for command. MAVI hit the left side of the gate and was slowest away, veered out sharply
early while a long way last, and remained far back. CAVE CREEK pressed the pace, was under a full drive by midway on the turn, and was empty into the
lane. QUEEN ASHY BABY pressed the early pace between horses, and stopped into the stretch. CATIRUSIA showed early speed inside, and stopped into
the stretch.

Footnotes
LEINSTER had early speed between rivals, rated back entering the turn, angled three wide near the three-eighths pole, stalked the duel around the bend,
closed determinedly outside and was up in the final strides. HIGH CRIME set a pressured pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and led until the
final strides. HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE settled in midpack while saving ground and had a mild rally inside for the show. INTER MIAMI vied three wide down
the backstretch then two wide around the turn and weakened in the drive. SHARED LEGACY raced off the pace two wide and never threatened.
BORRACHO played no factor while racing three wide. SMART REMARK was off slow and trailed inside.

Footnotes
BOREAS took over around the first turn and moved inside, rated along to the stretch, and responded to pressure to remain in command. GROUP HUG
raced two to three wide throughout, finished one-paced and got the place between horses. Q F SEVENTY FIVE advanced mildly into the stretch three wide,
bumped with TOUR OF DUTY a furlong out, and lacked a solid final response. SARATOGA FLASH raced close up inside to the stretch, and was
outfinished. EL KABONG unseated the rider and ran off prior to the start, was apprehended and came away without further incident, saved ground
advancing after six furlongs, and flattened out late on the rail. TOUR OF DUTY saved ground in midpack to the far turn, moved off the rail bumping Q F
SEVENTY FIVE in mid stretch, and had no punch. NEOTROPIC broke two lengths slowly, and was never prominent. JERRY'S TURN prompted the pace
outside BOREAS for six furlongs, and tired. LORD OF WAR raced in range three to four wide to the top of the stretch, and tired. GOLDEN WHIM broke two
lengths slow, raced three to four wide, and was through before reaching the stretch. ORIGINAL TIMES REINSTATED UPON REVIEW; RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
BLACK MAGIC WOMAN prompted the pace three wide in the four path, seized command near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, angled into the
two path as FUNNYBET closed along the rail and just lasted outside of that foe. FUNNYBET stumbled at the start, saved ground well off the pace, closed
gamely along the rail, reached even terms in deep stretch and lost the bob. DON'T GET KHOZY settled off the pace outside, made a four wide move
nearing the lane and flattened out in the drive. WHISPERING PINES came out soon after the start into ADDILYN'S path and was clipped behind by that
runner, had speed three wide between foes, took the lead midway around the turn, led to the quarter pole then weakened. PRINCESS BETTY chased the
pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. ADDILYN clipped heels soon after the start, raced two wide and made little impact. O'MALLEY set the pace in the
two path and stopped nearing the lane.

OMNIA quickly cleared to the lead, rated along near the inside to the stretch, and responded to pressure to keep TOWA at bay. TOWA prompted the winner
from the start, had aim two wide into the stretch, but could not seriously threaten. AERODYNAMIC saved ground early in range, raced two wide around the
far turn, and gained only mildly in an even effort. JOST SAYIN saved ground throughout, and failed to menace. MISS JEN raced in the second flight, came
four wide off the far turn and had no rally. SCATNAP raced two to three wide, and lacked the needed response. HOPONTHEBUSGUS was never
prominent. GENERIC MARK was outrun inside. FANTASTIC KINGDOM never reached contention while three to four wide. YAKO was outrun throughout.

FLYING SCOTSMAN set a clear pace along the rail, shrugged off a challenge nearing the lane, stuck on the left lead in upper stretch, switched over near
the eighth pole and widened under a drive. EVER DANGEROUS broke awkwardly, advanced outside to stalk the winner two wide in the clear, edged closer
rounding the far turn, was no match in the lane but held well to be clearly second best. GRAND JOURNEY raced off the pace two wide, never threatened
the top two but stayed on to gain the show. LAMARTINE (BRZ) saved ground and failed to menace. STRUCTOR settled off the pace while racing two wide,
went three wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. PENALTY clipped heels and nearly unseated the rider nearing the first turn, dropped
well back inside and was never close thereafter. ORIGINAL TIMES REINSTATED UPON REVIEW; RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
MISCHEVIOUS ALEX pressed the pace between CAJUN BROTHER and FROSTED GRACE, edged to the front going comfortably near the five-sixteenths
as the latter two came under heavy pressure, got roused through the furlong grounds and moved clear, and was kept to task. FROSTED GRACE vied
outside CAJUN BROTHER and MISCHEVIOUS ALEX for a half-mile, stayed on his left lead through the drive and prevailed in the battle for second. CAJUN
BROTHER sprinted clear early, felt a two-pronged attack on his outside flank into the turn, and yielded after a half on the rail. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ)
broke slowest, moved in from the four-path trailing around the turn, and tired.

Footnotes
FLORIFORM stalked the pace from the rail, split rivals in upper stretch, seized command near the eighth pole and burst clear under a drive. BRACKEN
raced four wide in midpack, advanced outside around the far turn, stayed on and was up for the place in the final strides. EL SOCIO prompted the pace
three wide around the first turn, bid two wide around the far turn, reached even terms nearing the eighth pole, could not match strides with the winner from
there and just missed second. WHAT SAY THEE saved ground off the pace, swung out in upper stretch and improved position outside. ROSENQUIST was
off slow, saved ground and failed to menace. POLSAR set the pace in the two path, angled in nearing the far turn, led to midstretch and tired.
PERFORMING ARTS chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. IRISHMAN played no factor while racing two wide early and four wide around the
far turn. LUPINO (GB) was outrun inside. CORE played no factor racing two and three wide. HOLY REDEEMER steadied entering the first turn, was up
close three wide for five furlongs and retreated.
