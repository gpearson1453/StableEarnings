Footnotes
CITI CHARM broke with the field, fell back, continued to lack speed into the turn while well out in the strip, swung out five wide turning for home, collared the
leaders just inside the furlong grounds, finished with good energy to be going away at the end. FROSTED PRAYER in the second flight while racing in the
three path, advanced and challenged between horses into the lane, held a brief advantage past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late,
clearly second best. COPLEY behind the pace while racing just off the inside, two path into the lane, up for the show late without posing a serious threat to
the top two. OUTLIER lacked early foot, four wide when moving closer just to the outside of the runner up entering the stretch, flattened out then weakened
late to lose the show. SIDETOWN broke sharp, set the pace along the inside, continued to show the way through the turn, weakened when headed by the
runner up nearing the furlong marker. MY BOY GUS away in good order, raced closest to the leader up the backstretch while firmly in hand, gave way from
between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
LADY ASTRID outrun in the early going just off the inside, swung out to be widest for the drive, closest with a flourish to be up in the very late going. LITTLE
BURRITO behind the pace while racing outside, four wide through much of the turn while maintaining contact with the leaders, set down, late interest to gain
the nod at the wire for the place while between rivals at the wire. HAMAZING LACE close up from the start, dueled through the turn off the inside, continued
to alternate through the bend and upper stretch, gained a larger lead inside the furlong marker, could not contain the top two at the wire, lost the nod for the
place while closest to the inside of the top three. FRANKIES MOONSHINE within striking distance while tracking inside, lacked a closing response when
called on for the drive. GOLD N SEXY broke sharp, dueled up front closest to the inside, faltered the final furlong. HIGHTAIL RUNAWAY lacked speed well
out in the strip, four wide through the turn, went one paced through the lane to lack a closing response. FANCY BLAZE well back early, continued to lag into
the stretch, improved position while not a serious threat. MISS CHECKMARK devoid of speed, lacked a serious rally. BACKGATE BELLE off slowly, raced
greenly to trail well back, showed little. TUESDAY in mid pack just off the inside, steadied in traffic turning into the stretch, backed up. THURSDAY
MORNING forwardly placed for a half, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
OFF THE MEDS forwardly placed inside, continued to save ground while within striking distance the middle half, eased out a bit to challenge between
horses nearing midstretch, narrowly showed the way to the wire to prevail in game fashion. NOT VERY GENTLE lacked speed while along the inside,
began to move far turn, steered out to be five wide turning for home, finished willingly to narrowly miss. URBANITE restless in the gate, hopped to be off
slowly, moved outside for the drive when beginning to rally entering the stretch, finished with good energy to be rapidly getting to the top two, too late. HAVE
A PLAN forwardly placed off the inside, three wide advance into a challenging position late in the final turn, vied past the furlong marker then flattened out in
the late going. POLAR WIND lacked speed, dropped inside, saved ground through most of the final turn, steered out a bit for the drive, improved position a
bit with some late interest. REVENIO turned in an even effort while racing just off the inside. PEPPER PIKE void of speed, passed tiring rivals while never in
contention. MARQUEE THUNDER broke on top, cleared toward the inside into the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch and through the second
turn, faltered when confronted the final furlong. DOWN HOME KITTEN in mid pack racing off the inside, in the two path through the final turn, made little
impact in the drive. GEMO RAIN chased the winner early, began a steady retreat after a half. GRAND ATLANTIC four wide through the first turn, gave way
in the drive.

Footnotes
NO SHIRT NO SHOES broke alertly, set the pace inside, dueled into the lane, headed, battled back under a right handed whip to prevail in game fashion.
BOX OF CHOCOLATES prompted the winner off the inside, dueled that one exiting the turn, put a head in front, outkicked by the winner in the run to the
wire. ALL EYES WEST in the second flight while racing in the three path, proved no match for the top pair, clear of the others. HARD TO PARK back off the
pace and the inside, moved a bit closer four wide through the turn, flattened out in the drive. WILD UNION lacked speed along the inside, moved out for the
drive, lacked a closing response. WAR DETONATOR within striking distance just off the inside, dropped inside for the drive, faded.

APPRAISAL off the pace and the inside, three wide late in the turn, shifted out widest for the drive, challenged on the outside late, drew clear under steady
handling, drifted in a bit late. SKYWAVE pressed the issue from the two path up the backstretch, vied between horses into the lane, held a narrow
advantage with a furlong remaining, proved no match for the winner late, proved game for the place spot. MEGA CHARLIE broke out, raced outside, raced
three out to four wide turning into the stretch, closer, drifted in slightly late, missed the place. FIRECRACKER STAND pressed the issue for a half three
wide, moved slightly closer while widest of the first flight late in the bend, flattened out the final furlong to lose a couple of positions. STUD PUPPY off a step
slow, raced back in trailing early, three wide into the lane, displayed some mild interest to pick up a position or two. PIZZA CHARLIE in the second flight for
a half off the inside, boxed in some traffic past the furlong marker, briefly attempted to steer in for room, moved out out a bit, checked up across a rival's
heels ate. ROMAN PHAROAH narrowly set the pace along the inside for a half, faltered when headed entering the stretch. DEVIL'S TOWER broke sharp,
steadily faded inside. KISSOFFTHEGLASS finished early. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF PIZZA CHARLIE AGAINST MEGA
CHARLIE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
TEMPT FATE with the pace from the start, vied between foes into and through the turn, continued to do battle past the furlong marker, long drive, drove
clear late. SIR BRAHMS in mid pack while racing well wide, four wide when moving a bit closer in the turn, finished up willingly to be up for the place late.
BEBOP SHOES settled off the pace and the inside, four wide into the lane while in some traffic, closer nearing the furlong grounds, missed the place.
WASABI MOON void of speed in trailing early, swung outside of traffic to be six wide into the lane, showed some belated interest down the center of the
strip to improve position. YOUNG BULL well back off the early pace, in the two path turn, improved inside of several rival into the stretch, little late gain.
SMELLIN CANDY with the pace outside, three wide through the turn when continuing to contest the issue, steadily weakened through the lane. SUNDAY
SERMON off a step slow, raced four wide through the turn, went evenly in the drive. ASPEN CLUB off a step slow, moved up to mid pack, in traffic then
steadied when four wide turning for home, finished up evenly when clear for the drive. BOO BE RIGHT fell back to lack speed after the start, two path turn,
remained back in showing little. DARK NINJA was racing in the main body when forced to steady in traffic into the turn, fell back and did not respond in the
drive. TEN BUDS broke sharp, narrowly set the pace closest to the inside of the first flight, gave way turning into the stretch. CAPTAIN DON forwardly
placed in some traffic into the turn, waited while four wide and surrounded late in the bend, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
OCEAN BREEZE lacked early foot well off the inside, worked way inside through the turn, squeezed through a narrow opening along the rail exiting the
bend, waited for room through much of upper stretch under patient handling, roused when clear, closed with good courage to prove best. CROWN JEWEL
broke on top, pressed the issue closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, drew clear but could not contain the winner.
SUGAR LOVE within striking distance behind the dueling leaders in the two path, set down for the drive, lacked a winning punch in the late going. FLASHY
BIZ last to leave, continued to lack speed for a half, picked off some tiring rivals in the drive while not a threat to the top three. MISTY BLUE dueled up front
while racing off the inside, faltered in the drive. BLINKERS in the second flight outside, 4w into lane, failed to muster a rally. UNDINE broke out, began a
steady retreat before a half.
