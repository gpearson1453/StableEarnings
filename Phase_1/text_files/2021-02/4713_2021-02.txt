Footnotes
SURELY A SMILE was settled to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then eased out, rallied when set down and closed steadily to catch NICE AND TRUE
late. NICE AND TRUE chased the leader three wide to the stretch, rallied to overtake the tiring pacesetter, responded in the drive but could not hold off the
winner. CLOCHARD STREET was outsprinted early, raced three wide while closing the gap to the stretch but got outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally.
GEE STREET had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch and also lacked a closing response. CHARMING LASS trailed to the stretch and was never a
threat. ROYAL ALEXIS sped clear, was off the rail to the stretch but tired and stopped suddenly.

BLUE BREEZE showed moderate early speed while sitting off of a slow pace, circled five wide and won driving. PERFECT EDITION was away well, took
control of a slow pace while maintaining a rail trip, hung tough in the stretch and was overtaken in the late stages. WIN LIKE COACH P was away slowly,
stalked a slow pace while maintaining a rail position, swung four wide and rallied to claim the show. OH LADY OH had no early speed, was allowed to settle
toward the back of the field, made a late move while passing tiring rivals. LIS LA VICTOIRE was away slowly, but was rushed up to press a slow pace while
travelling on the rail, chased the leader and weakened. ON THE VERGE showed moderate early speed while sitting off of a slow pace, weakened, and was
through after a half mile.

Footnotes
RIDEO broke on top, assumed a rail trip while sitting off of the pace, angled into the two path, wore down rivals to win driving. MOONLIGHT BLUE was off a
step slowly, made a three wide early move to contend for the lead, set slow fractions while maintaining a rail trip, dueled in the closing stages and was
second best. INCREDIBLE LUCK was allowed to settle in the two path while sitting off the pace, advanced position on the backstretch, was outkicked to mid
stretch but kept to task to the line. SPEED SAVER chased leaders while travelling in the two path, lost position along the backstretch but was gaining
belatedly. SOUTHEAST ASIA was unhurried early while travelling along the rail, settled at the back of the pack, and was not a factor.

INSANIAMANIA was outrun to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then eased out widest, responded when set down and closed fast to prevail.
DARKSABER pressed the pace to the turn, moved up to duel three wide to the stretch, inched clear to mid stretch, held on to deep stretch but was caught.
LUCA'S RIDE had no speed, raced two wide on the turn then closed willingly in a good debut. CIEN POR CIEN set the pace off the rail, was collared by the
runnerup but stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. AMBITIOUS ME stalked the leaders from the rail to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and
did not rally. STORMING WARRIOR saved ground to no avail. PROOF OF PARANOIA tracked the pace four wide to the stretch then weakened. EL
COMANDO pressed the pace in the opening quarter mile, got outkicked on the turn and gave way in the drive.

BREAKING THE CODE was allowed to settle off of moderate fractions, advanced position along the far turn, took a three wide trip in the stretch to win
driving. FOGGY BOTTOM was unhurried early while travelling at the back of the field, improved position on the far turn, rallied to make a late bid in the
closing stages to get up for second. EDDIE'S SISTER hurried early while pressing a moderate pace in the two path, took control in the stretch and was
passed by oncoming rivals. TRULY FABULOUS settled mid-pack while travelling three wide, made a mild bid along the far turn and was outkicked.
ZAGRAH (GB) was hustled early, setting moderate fractions and weakened. SILLY NOTION showed moderate early speed while saving ground on the rail,
advanced position along the backstretch and faded.

HOT RAGEOUS hustled to the front, set the pace off the rail to the stretch then kicked away to mid stretch and held driving. EXQUISITE LEGACY broke
inward and bumped LIFE IN PARADISE, was chasing to the turn, raced two then three wide, shifted out in upper stretch and made a late run for the place.
FAST TO FORTUNE also chased the winner from the rail to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. AMAZEN GRAZEN had no speed,
was fanned four wide to the stretch and did not threaten. NEW WAYS TO DREAM pressed the winner three wide to the stretch, could not keep up in upper
stretch and weakened. MISCHIEF FREE had no speed, was three then four wide on the turn and never a threat. LOTSABLING was outsprinted to the turn
then also did not threaten in the drive. LIFE IN PARADISE was bumped by EXQUISITE LEGACY at the start, had no speed then saved ground but was not
a factor.

Footnotes
OUR SILVER OAK was unhurried to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, rallied then shifted out for room in mid stretch and closed strongly to be
up in time. AMERICAN FARMER settled mid pack to the second turn, was two wide and rallied to the stretch, got on terms leaving mid stretch, battled
determinedly but was nailed on the wire. KING OF SPEED chased the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide to take a short lead to mid stretch then
was collared by AMERICAN FARMER, dug in bravely to final strides then missed second. CONO broke a bit slow but hustled along outside rivals to get the
lead on the first turn, set all the pace to the second turn, was overtaken nearing mid stretch then tired. MORE POWER TO HIM had no speed, trailed to the
second turn, saved ground to the stretch, shifted out and was closing some ground late. LYMEBYRD was allowed to settle to the half, circled four wide on
the second turn to briefly loom a threat but slackened in the drive. FIVESTAR LYNCH (IRE) chased the pace to the second turn, was four wide but stopped
after six furlongs.

Footnotes
IZ INVINCIBLE never far back to the second turn, was off the rail to the stretch then rallied inside of THE REF, took over a sixteenth out and edged clear
driving. TINK'S TWIRL stalked the pace to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch, rallied to mid stretch then was outkicked for the win but dug in
gamely to get the nod for second. THE REF set the pace for six furlongs, responded when hooked in mid stretch then could not stay with the winner and
was nailed for second. LIFELINE was four wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, raced outside rivals and five deep to the stretch then was
making a mild bid late. PERFECT COME BACK was chasing for a half mile, raced four wide to the stretch then could not muster the needed response in the
drive. GOOCH EXPRESS stalked the leader for five furlongs while three wide but was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. CRIMSON CLOUD was settled
for a half mile, raced off the rail on the second turn but was not a threat in the drive. RED CLEM had no speed and did not threaten. KID ARCADE saved
ground throughout while being outrun.
