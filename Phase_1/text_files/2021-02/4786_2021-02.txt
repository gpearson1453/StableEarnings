Footnotes
PASS THE CHAMPAGNE perched herself four wide while stalking outside of foes down the backstretch, inched forward into the turn to vie for the lead
outside of FRONT STREET while in the three path around the bend, forged an advantage from that foe approaching the three sixteenths pole, drew off in
upper stretch with ANOTHER WOMAN in pursuit, and safely maintained a margin from that foe to the wire. ANOTHER WOMAN tracked from midpack in the
five path around the turn, commenced a rally turning for home while shifting down to the four path, then sustained her advance in chase of PASS THE
CHAMPAGNGE through the lane, and pulled away from the rest of the field while proving second best. FRONT STREET set the pace along the inside,
showed the way while staying in the two path and encountering heavy pressure from PASS THE CHAMPAGNE around the turn, but was headed by that foe
approaching the three sixteenths pole, yielded in upper stretch, then held show to the wire while tiring. TEMPER MINT TWIST stalked two wide and from
between horses early on, but was roused to keep position passing the half mile, failed to do so and faded to midpack into the turn, took the bend in the four
path, then stayed on mildly for a minor share. CHAMPAGNE SALUTE broke subtly outwards, stalked three wide and from between horses early on, then
two wide behind the pace setters into the turn, but failed to keep pace with those rivals at the five sixteenths marker, and kept on. GIGI B. rushed to be
forwardly placed along the inside, chased the leaders while shifting off of the rail in upper stretch, but faded late. VIDA YELLOW lied far off of the pace in the
two path around the turn, swung to the five path entering the lane, and improved on her left lead without threatening. SIBAAQ lagged behind the field into
the turn, came into the lane in four path while still trailing, and improved past tiring foes. SHE'S A SHOO IN got crowded from an inner drifting rival and
steadied soon after the start, lied off of the pace in the two path around the turn, and failed to factor. MIA AT MIDNIGHT lied off of the pace in the four path
around the turn, got floated to the six path entering the stretch, and faded.

entering the lane, ranged up to the leader at the furlong pole, and drew clear thereafter. CON LIMA got a bit antsy waiting for the gates to open, hopped
outwards and bumped the gate once they did, got wrangled back into the first turn to rate off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the four path in pursuit
of the leaders, got floated five wide while getting outkicked by the eventual winner in upper stretch, delayed her lead change to the furlong grounds, but
sustained a rally to reach place through the late stages. JOY OF PAINTING stalked two wide, inched closer down the backstretch to vie outside of the
leader while inside of TOBY'S HEART around the far turn, forged an advantage at the quarter pole, but was headed by the eventual winner at the furlong
pole, yielded late, but just held show. I GET IT saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, advanced inside of foes down the backstretch to a stalking
position by the seven sixteenths grounds, but was bumped by an outer foe at the three furlong pole, steadied due to getting pinched along the rail during the
incident, saved ground far off of the pace around the far turn, then rerallied inside of the leaders through the final furlong to just miss show. LIJANA tracked
from midpack along the inside, then from the three path around the far turn while inside of CON LIMA, failed to match strides with that foe turning for home,
shifted outside of her in midstretch, and improved late without threatening. TOBYS HEART tracked from midpack three wide, advanced into the turn to
prompt the leading duo around that bend, but was outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch while being floated four wide, and tired through the final
furlong. MAIL ORDER cleared inner foes into the first turn, felt pressure from JOY OF PAINTING into the far turn, showed the way via a narrow margin from
that foe and TOBY'S HEART around that bend, but got headed approaching the quarter pole, gave way in midstretch, and further weakened thereafter.
DESIGNER READY trailed the field while taking both turns in the two path, and was outrun. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUN INTO
THE FAR TURN, SPANISH LOVEAFFAIR WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOURTH. THE RUN-UP DISTANCE IS UNAVAILABLE.

COLLABORATE set the pace outside of COMPEADOR leaving the chute, inherited a clear advantage at the five furlong pole after that foe faltered, showed
the way inside of KING FORCE around the bend while staying in the two path, kicked clear under his own power passing the quarter pole, widened with a
few shoulder taps of encouragement in upper stretch, then extended his margin handily through the final furlong. BENNYFROMTHEBRONX got crowded in
tight quarters between horses soon after the start, lied far off of the pace early on, commenced a visually impressive rally in the five path into the turn to be
in striking range of the leader at the quarter pole, but quickly proved no match for that rival while failing to match strides approaching the three sixteenths
pole, hung on his left lead through the lane, lugged inwards at the sixteenth marker, but held place to the wire. FULL COURT PRESS tracked from midpack
along the inside, rated off of the pace around the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch, and rallied. EMPEROR'S CAUSE lied off of the pace three
wide and between horses early on, took the turn in the four path while getting outkicked by BENNYFROMTHEBRONX passing the five sixteenths marker,
then stayed on through the lane but was outfinished by an outer foe for show. HOUDINI'S AWESOME trailed in the four path, swung to the seven path
turning for home, and stayed on. PERFECT CUT got bumped by an outer foe at the start, shifted inwards shortly after crowding a pair of rivals, lied
forwardly placed two wide, faded into the turn, then failed to factor. KING FORCE broke outwardly, tracked from midpack five wide and outside of foes,
advanced to stalking position passing the five furlong marker, bid for the lead outside of COLLABORATE while in the three path into the turn, but faded at
the quarter pole. BOLD MINISTER got in tight between horses soon after the start, lied far off of the pace along the inside, saved ground, but to no avail.
BLITZ TO WIN got antsy in the gate, broke inwards and bumped a foe, stalked three wide, chased from behind the leaders into the turn, then faded at the
quarter pole, before weakening through the lane. HEY PADRE lied off of the pace four wide and between horses, then faded into the turn. CAMPEADOR
vied along the inside leaving the chute, but faded approaching the five furlong pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
ANNEX settled off the pace two wide, angled seven wide turning for home, rallied on the left lead, switched leads near the sixteenth pole and was up late
under left-handed urging. SCARLETT SKY saved ground off the pace, split rivals two wide near the eighth pole, took the lead soon after, battled on inside of
the winner and just missed. CHESS'S DREAM was unhurried while saving ground early, advanced four wide around the far turn and rallied through the lane
to gain the show late. FIGHTING FORCE settled off the runaway pace two wide, bid between foes nearing the eighth pole but was outfinished. SIGILOSO
raced off the pace three wide, bid between rivals nearing the eighth pole but was outkicked through the final furlong. CAVE HILL trailed two and three wide
to upper stretch, swung widest and passed tiring rivals. HOT BLOODED chased the runway pacesetter from the rail in the clear, took the lead nearing the
eighth pole but wilted soon after. ARZAK ran off to set a sizzling pace and stopped in the drive. THE RUN-UP WAS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ATTACHMENT RATE lied far off of the pace in the four path around the turn, commenced a rally while shifting to the five path at the quarter pole, and
sustained his determined charge while on his left lead through the final furlong to drive past the leaders inside the final sixteenth. WEST WILL POWER was
slow away, lied off of the pace two wide, commenced a five wide rally at the five sixteenths pole, bid for the lead outside of ENDORSED at the furlong pole,
but was outkicked by an outer surging foe late. ENDORSED prompted the pace four to three wide, decisively assumed command passing the half mile pole,
drew off to a clear lead into the turn, held a margin in the two path around the turn, but met WEST WILL POWER's bid at the furlong pole, got headed by
that rival at the sixteenth marker, and gave way. SUPERFECTO prompted the pace three wide and from between horses early on, took back to stalk
passing the five furlong marker, took the turn four wide while in midpack, advanced inside of ATTACHMENT RATE through upper stretch, but was outkicked
by that foe at the furlong grounds, shifted inwards, and stayed on for a minor share. JUST WHISTLE broke outwardly, trailed along the inside, shifted off of
the rail turning for home, then to the seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly. MUBARMAJ vied two wide and between horses leaving the chute,
chased the clear leader from the inside around the turn, then faded in midstretch. PAYNE took the turn in the two path while far off of the pace, and made
little impact. VIOLENT CITY lied at the rear of the field in the two path around the turn, and never got involved. UNTITLED stalked five wide early on, shifted
down to be three wide into the turn, held stalking position around the bend, but faltered at the quarter pole. CLEAR DESTINATION tracked from midpack
along the inside, but faded. RALSTON set the pace while clearing inner foes early on, felt a group of pressuring rivals leaving the chute, then was
overhauled at the half mile pole, was done early, and eased through the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
VENEZUELAN HUG settled off the pace along the inside, raced two wide between foes around the far turn, lacked a clear path through most of the lane, got
through between foes in deep stretch and shot to the front in the final strides. OLYMPIC RUNNER checked early, raced two and three wide in midpack,
shifted further out in upper stretch, rallied outside, took the lead in deep stretch but could not quite withstand the winner. GEAR JOCKEY stalked the pace
from the rail, angled three wide in upper stretch, rallied between foes and was outkicked late. WINTERS BACK prompted the pace two wide, took the lead
nearing the eighth pole and weakened late. EONS raced four wide around the turns and never threatened. DYNADRIVE saved ground and failed to
menace. FANCY LIQUOR steadied early, stalked the pace three wide and lacked a rally. BIZZEE CHANNEL set the pace along the rail to midstretch and
tired. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) played no factor while racing two wide early and four wide around the far turn.

Footnotes
FEARLESS perched himself outside of foes three wide in midpack, made first turn on the clear leader to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, drew
clear passing the quarter pole, and held well to the wire with AVANT GARDE in pursuit. AVANT GARDE lied off of the pace in the four path around the turn,
commenced his advance at the five sixteenths pole, brushed with PERFORMER in upper stretch while outkicking that foe, grinded away at FEARLESS's
advantage through the final furlong, but was denied by that foe. PERFORMER stalked two wide, came under coaxing at the three furlong pole while getting
outmoved by FEARLESS, sustained chasing position turning for home, then exchanged mild brushed with AVANT GARDE while getting outkicked by that
foe at the furlong grounds before keeping on to secure a minor placing. EYE OF A JEDI lied off of the pace along the inside while under steady urging,
faded into the turn to trail the field by a margin around the bend, swung to the eight path turning for home, then steadily drifted out to the middle of the track
through the lane while improving. PHAT MAN stalked along the inside, but failed to keep pace with group of outer bidding foes around the turn, swung
outside of them entering the lane, and failed to factor. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) opened up early on despite being hard held, tired around the turn, got
headed at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened thereafter.

Footnotes
SAYYAAF set a fast pace in the two path, held clear to deep stretch and lasted. BLAMELESS raced closest to the winner while racing in the two path
around both turns, rallied through the lane and was gaining fast late. MALIBU MAMBO settled off the pace along the inside, tipped out in upper stretch,
rallied inside of BLAMELESS and just missed second. BODECREAM raced off the pace two and three wide, continued on the left lead to the sixteenth pole
and rallied belatedly. FIRST PREMIO raced off the pace three wide, shifted further out in upper stretch and finished with some interest. ANGELUS
WARRIOR failed to menace while racing two and three wide. STREET READY chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. KINENOS was
bumped at the start, raced well back two wide, went four deep rounding the far turn and played no factor. OPRY was never prominent while saving ground.
CLEAR VISION was outrun inside. ALMASHRIQ broke outwardly and bumped KINENOS at the start and played no further factor while racing two wide.
THE RUN-UP WAS UNAVAILABLE.

GOT STORMY stalked the clear leader from the two path, inched closer around the far turn to bid for the lead in upper stretch, edged an advantage
approaching the final sixteenth, and gamely held from ZOFELLE (IRE) late. ZOFELLE (IRE) rated off of the pace two wide, steadily gained ground four wide
around the far turn, responded to pressure and quickened in the final furlong to produce a late surge, but missed on the wire. FEEL GLORIOUS (GB) saved
ground far off of the pace around the first turn, took the far turn three wide before swinging five wide entering the lane, then sustained a late charge outside
of foes through the final furlong, but ran out of ground to catch the leaders. JAKARTA established a clear margin into the first turn, held it into the far turn
before digging in inside of GOT STORMY as that foe made a bid in upper stretch, clung to an advantage passing the furlong grounds, but was headed
approaching the final sixteenth, then got outfinished for a minor placing by a pair of foes approaching the wire. ART OF ALMOST tracked from midpack two
wide, then three wide around the far turn inside of ZOFELLE (IRE), but got outkicked by that foe passing the furlong pole, and chased the leaders home.
RICETTA (GB) rated off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn two wide, but only managed a chasing grind from between horses through the lane,
and failed to threaten. SECRET TIME (GER) stalked along the inside, but was outmoved by a pair of outer foes turning for home, chased from along the
inside through upper stretch, but faded through the final furlong. BIENVILLE STREET trailed throughout and never got involved.

Footnotes
WHOLEBODEMEISTER vied inside early, drew clear around the turn, spurted clear in upper stretch, shied under one left-handed whip in midstretch then
straightened out under hand urging and widened. CRAZY BEAUTIFUL was reluctant to load, settled off the pace outside, moved up four wide between foes
around the turn, angled wider into the lane and finished willingly to gain the place. COMPETITIVE SPEED raced well back outside down the backstretch,
made a strong five wide move into contention around the turn, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong.
PENS STREET raced six wide in midpack and stayed on to improve position in the lane. CURLIN'S CATCH was bumped just after the start, was in range
two wide but came up empty in the lane. HAPPY CONSTITUTION was outrun inside. MILLEFEUILLE settled in midpack two and three wide, was shuffled
back behind a stopping rival near the five-sixteenths pole and lacked any further response. THREE TIPSY CHIX played no factor while racing three wide.
VEQUIST came out and bumped CURLIN'S CATCH just after the start, raced in range four wide between foes, continued on the left lead in the lane, lacked
any response, was eased and walked off. ADIOS TRIPPI vied outside of the winner down the backstretch, stopped rounding the turn, pulled up in the
stretch and walked off. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION IS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ANTOINETTE edged an advantage from BELLE LAURA and smoothly shifted to the rail into the first turn, set an easy and uncontested pace down the
backstretch with her ears pricked, kicked clear when called upon in upper stretch, and held sway to the wire. BELLE LAURA vied along the inside early on,
but allowed ANTIONETTE to clear off into the first turn, stalked that foe from along the inside around both turns, then chased her through the lane while
inside a pair of rivals, and claimed place from them approaching the wire. SISTER HANAN stalked two wide in closest pursuit to the clear leader, produced
a mild bid outside of that foe turning for home, but was repelled in upper stretch, chased her home from between horses through the lane, but flopped back
to her left lead around the sixteenth pole, and lost place to her inner rival late. TUNED (GB) saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the two path turning for
home before tipping three wide in upper stretch to produce a place bid outside of a pair of foes, but hung for that position in the late stages. WAR LIKE
GODDESS shied briefly from an inner foe at the start, trailed the field along the inside around both turns, swung six wide entering the lane, and rallied well
into the fast finishing tempo, but failed to reach contention. KALIFORNIA QUEEN (GER) lied off of the pace two wide, came into the lane in the three path,
chased well before shifting five wide and outside of the battling group for place, but failed to threaten them late. LOVELY LUVY lied forwardly placed two
wide, but pulled while being hard to handle crossing the wire for the first time, finally settled halfway around the first turn, then took the far turn three wide,
got outkicked by an inner foe at the three sixteenths pole, and faded. BACCHANALIA tracked from midpack three wide around the first turn, then four wide
around the far turn before being floated five wide in upper stretch, and faded thereafter. HEAVENLY CURLIN lied at the rear of the field along the inside,
then two wide around the far turn, but was outrun. RUN UP DISTANCE IS UNAVAILABLE

Footnotes
GREATEST HONOUR was unhurried while racing well off the pace three wide, remained well back while appearing to idle behind rivals midway around the
far turn, swung five wide near the five-sixteenths pole, responded to right-handed urging turning for home, surged outside and was up and clear late. DRAIN
THE CLOCK set the pace in the two path, opened up nearing the lane, stayed on willingly, led to deep stretch but was no match in the final seventy yards.
PAPETU was devoid of speed while saving ground around the first turn, made a strong four wide move around the far turn, loomed outside in upper stretch
then evened in the final furlong. TARANTINO was bumped and pushed five wide early on the first turn, was up close outside down the backstretch, was
ridden along three wide around the far turn and weakened in the lane. JIRAFALES broke awkwardly, raced two and three wide and never threatened.
KING'S OVATION was washy pre-race, had speed between foes, was bumped between rivals entering the first turn, raced four wide around that bend,
chased two wide around the far turn and lacked a closing bid. PRIME FACTOR raced off the pace two and three wide, steadied near the seven-sixteenths
pole and lacked a response. FIRE AT WILL was bumped between rivals entering the first turn, prompted the pace three wide, retreated around the far turn,
lugged in upper stretch and continued to fade. TIZ TACT TOE was reluctant to load and made little impact while racing two and three wide. SOSOSUBTLE
angled out entering the first turn and bumped FIRE AT WILL into KING'S OVATION and TARANTINO, angled back in midway around that bend, raced up
close inside into the far turn, angled three wide to move into second midway around that bend but stopped nearing the lane.
