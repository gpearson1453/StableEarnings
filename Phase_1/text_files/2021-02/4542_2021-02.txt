Footnotes
GLITTER TIME broke in at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the two path on the turn, dueled outside that
foe into the final furlong, lugged in while nicely kept off the runner-up with repeated tugs of the right-rein and a left-handed whip, was bumped by the
runner-up nearing the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. G'S A LOOKER broke in at the start then showed good speed, set the pace under
pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, dueled inside of the winner into the final sixteenth, came out a few strides from the wire and bumped
with that foe and just missed while clear for the place. MA CHER AMIO settled off the pace, dropped back in the two path on the turn, was asked for her
best in upper stretch, gained in the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. GRACE'S GAL was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn,
drifted out under a left-handed whip in upper stretch and failed to threaten. LAUREL'S CRICKET was pinched back between horses at the start, raced
towards the rear under urging, went three wide on the turn, dropped in under the whip into upper stretch and was no factor. G'S MINE settled in third
position on the outside, was urged three wide on the turn and came up empty. WILD CHARLIE was coaxed along off the pace, dropped back quickly while
four to five wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and faltered.

tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two path on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, battled under a drive into the final furlong
and weakened. HAMAZING WISDOM became rank on the initial straightaway, raced inside to the two path while extremely rank under steadying restraint
through the first turn then early on the backstretch, moved out around the five-eighths then leveled out some on the outside, advanced closer to the leader
near the seven-sixteenths, chased three to four wide on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and came up empty. GOLDEN V C went two to three

set down in upper stretch and drew off under strong urging. MON CHERIE was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, raced off the pace under urging,
went three wide on the turn, swung out five wide into upper stretch and just got up for the place. EMPRESSIVE TAP was coaxed along off the pace, jostled
with a foe near the seven-sixteenths, went around the turn in the four path, spun five wide into the stretch under a right-handed whip then dropped in a path
and proved no match for the winner then was caught for the place while able to get the show. BUSINESS LADY settled off the pace, saved ground under
urging on the turn and lacked the needed response. J Z'S FIRST broke a step slow, lagged at the rear, saved ground on the turn, angled out under a drive
near the furlong marker and was no factor. CARSON'S PRINCESS broke through the gate prior to the start then was brought back around and reloaded,
raced well off the pace, went five wide on the turn, floated six to seven wide into upper stretch and failed to respond. TIME FOR A SONG was urged along
on the outside, jostled with a foe at the seven-sixteenths, went five wide on the turn then was driven six wide into the stretch and had nothing left. TIZ A
QUEEN broke in then bumped the hindquarters of foe and was off a bit slow, dropped from the four path to the two path on the turn, drifted in near the
furlong marker then moved out around the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. SMACKFIRE chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path and
retreated. MY LITTLE ANITA broke through the front of the gate prior to the start but was held in the stall, raced off the pace under urging, went four wide on
the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CANE CREEK ROAD angled in while going to the front, set the clear pace on the inside, was challenged at the five-sixteenths, responded well when asked
at the quarter-pole, shook off CLEARLY MAD outside the furlong marker and drew off under steady urging. SOUL COAXING lugged out a bit into the first
turn, went five then four wide on that bend, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the far turn and got up for the place. CLEARLY MAD rounded the
first turn in the two path, tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up in the two path on the far turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, was put to a drive into
upper stretch, lugged in nearing the furlong marker and weakened while clear for the show. TOUR THE WORLD saved ground on the first turn, settled
towards the rear, went four then three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. SHOULDA HAD IT went
three wide on the first turn, settled in third position, was roused three wide on the far turn and failed to respond. PERFECT ONE settled on the inside,
bumped with a rival leaving the backstretch, saved ground into the stretch and failed to threaten. RAMIRIN was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths,
went three wide on the turns, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. HARRISON'S ROSE was hard held while rank early, continued under
vigorous restraint in the three path on the first turn, was rated off the pace, bumped with a foe leaving the backstretch, went around the far turn in the two
path and failed to respond. OXBOW WIND was taken up then climbed behind horses early, saved ground on the turns, turned into the stretch in two path
and also failed to respond.

Footnotes
MOUNT ATHOS was hustled from the start, moved clear midway down the backstretch, extended the advantage while inside on the turn, responded well
when set down in upper stretch and held under strong urging. MOLTO VIVACE settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, swung four wide
into the stretch, brushed with a foe while drifting in outside the furlong marker and finished willingly for the place. DONZI was hustled from the start, showed
speed on the inside of a rival, was eased back off the pace midway down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, moved into the two path at the
three-sixteenths then brushed with a foe and lacked the needed kick while just able to get the show. PRIME TIME PLAYER bumped with a rival at the start,
dropped back while urged along, saved ground on the turn, moved out under a drive inside the furlong marker and finished with late energy to just miss the
show. COPA chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, brushed with foes outside the furlong marker and tired. FIND NEW ROADS
was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. WHISKEY
