Footnotes
WALDORF pressed the pace shaking clear in upper stretch holding firm to wire. BRADDOCK stalked the pace angling five wide to upper stretch responding
well as second best. JOE CAIN a step slow early lost ground to upper stretch outbidding the others from mid track. ALYCAR FLASH away alertly set a
pressured pace wearing down the final eighth. DISTORTEDATTHEBAR chased through the turn to upper stretch wearing down late. SALT MINE played no
factor. NETAS was never involved. HOLTZ faded on the turn. ANTEROS was never involved. MONSIEUR BROWN gave way on the turn.
