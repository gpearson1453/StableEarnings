position while never a threat. DECISION MAKER raced evenly between horses to the half with no late kick. SCABBARD never far back while three-four
wide into far turn with nothing left when needed. KREWE CHIEF never a factor while outside in the stretch run. SURF AND TURF well placed, never far
back to the half, gave way quickly. CEDUNA never menaced. ZAMBIAN no late kick with a rail stretch rin.
