Footnotes
PICKENS bumped with a rival at the start while coming out in front, quickly sped clear, was guided around the turn in the two path, responded well when
asked at the top of the stretch, powered away under a few pops of the crop and drew off under steady urging. HEREWECOMETOGETYOU broke in and
was off a half-step slow, moved out at the rear of the field, went three then four wide under urging on the turn, swung seven while making a run at the
quarter-pole but was no match for the winner while clear for the place. MIDNIGHT SPIRIT bumped with a rival at the start, chased the pace on the outside
then in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired while clear for the show. SAINTSGOTROBBED broke a step slow, was
urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. CALLINGINTHENIGHT broke in and was off a
half-step slow, settled towards the rear, was shuffled back some along the rail while behind NOCOMET near the three-eighths, checked when that foe came
in at the three-sixteenths, moved off the rail while roused shortly thereafter, went between horses outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten.
SHACKLE THE GOLD was urged along off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, was roused for more at the quarter-pole and failed to respond.
NOCOMET was well placed just off the pace, dropped back some along the rail while under urging nearing the three-eighths, moved to the two path
approaching the quarter-pole, came in under a right-handed crop and bothered CALLINGINTHENIGHT at the three-sixteenths and capitulated.

in upper stretch, kicked clear outside the furlong marker and proved best under steady urging. COMMERCIAL FLASH was away alertly, settled towards the
rear on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then moved further out coming to the three-sixteenths and finished
willingly for the place. HEY GRACE bumped with rivals at the start, showed speed inside of two foes then chased the pace, went two then three wide on the
turn, shifted out a path in upper stretch, moved further out in the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. RUNPEGGYRUN

roused, dropped back to the rail under strong urging inside the furlong marker and improved position. EZEE ENOUGH bumped with foes at the start, was
urged between horses early, moved out near the half-mile pole, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.

pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. CRYPTO BRAVE broke out at the

Footnotes
GIRL'S ON FIRE came out under tight restraint while in front early, raced inside on the first turn, set the pace in hand through a glacial second quarter-mile,
moved clear outside the half-mile pole, was challenged while inside on the far turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, kicked clear under the
crop inside the three-sixteenths, extended the advantage under the crop into the final forty yards then was placed under a hand ride as the rider stood up
and looked to the grandstand while celebrating victory. SWEET WORKOUT raced inside under restraint on the first turn, was keen under a vigorous hold as
the pace slackened late on that bend and onto the backstretch, raced just off the pace, shifted out leaving the backstretch then gained to make a bid in the
two path on the far turn, lost touch with the winner under the crop outside the furlong marker and proved no match while able to get the place. PAYTIENCE
PAYS broke out and bumped with a rival, bumped with PRINCESS TINE into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, was rated off the pace, came
under urging in the two path on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick while clear for
the show. PRINCESS TINE (FR) bumped with a rival into the first turn, went four wide on that bend, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked four wide
on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. LAUGH IT OFF was hustled from the start, went two to three wide on
the first turn, settled at the rear, saved ground on the far turn and failed to threaten. SLIGHTLY SASSY was bumped at the start, rounded the first turn in the
two path, stalked the pace down the backstretch, chased three wide on the far turn and retreated. (Rail at 8 Feet)

stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed well to gain the lead approaching the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under steady urging. SOUL SONG
displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came
under the crop in upper stretch, disposed of DIXIE STREET inside the furlong marker but was overtaken by the winner while clear for the place. DIXIE

furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened but was clear for the show. OUTLAW X. moved out at the rear of the field, went six wide under

SAIL ON ELLEN stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, made a bid while asked on the far turn, took the lead in the three path into the stretch,
battled outside the runner-up to the wire and prevailed under strong urging. MAID OF HONOR was hustled to the lead, set the pace on the inside, was
asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead into upper stretch, fought on well with the winner to the wire and just missed while able to get the place. CEANT
was taken in hand while showing early speed, saved ground on the first turn, moved out near the five-eighths, was rated just off the pace, chased three wide
on the far turn then was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the top two in the drive and finished willingly for the show. TAKE CHARGE PATTI went
four wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, moved closer midway down the backstretch, was urged three wide on the far turn, came five wide
into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick. SCONSET went three wide on the first turn, was reserved under tight restraint, moved closer
midway down the backstretch, was roused at the seven-sixteenths, saved ground under strong urging on the far turn and lacked the needed response. ZZA
ZZA ZOOM broke a bit slow, tugged hard at the bit while keen early, saved ground on the first turn, moved out while settling off the pace, went four wide on
the far turn, lugged in some just after turning into the stretch and had nothing left. TAPPIN INTO SUMMER was bumped in the hindquarters at the start,
went four wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace, went around the far turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
SHELBY TO bobbled inward at the start then bumped the hindquarters of a foe and checked very sharply, spotted the front many lengths, went three wide
on the first turn, lagged at the rear, raced five wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. I GOT WINGS went around the first turn
in the two path, settled well back in the field, went two then three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and showed little. (Rail at 8 Feet)

SHADES OF TRUTH pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, shook clear into the stretch
and drew away under strong urging. SUMMER IS HOT showed speed then was eased back just off the pace, started the turn in the two path, shifted three
then four wide late on that bend, chased the winner in the stretch and was second best. ELSIE GIRL was bumped hard at the start and forced out, jostled
with a rival and was taken up near the half-mile pole, raced inside to the two path on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch then moved out under a drive
and lacked the needed response while along for the show. MERCEDES LADIES set the pace under pressure to her outside, lost the lead leaving the
backstretch, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired. BOX OF PICTURES broke a step slow then was taken up, swerved out
sharply at the five-eighths, went six wide on the turn and failed to threaten. LIBERATED STRIFE was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch then drifted out at the three-sixteenths and was no factor. RUBY BEGONIA veered out at the start and bumped hard with a
rival, became keen under a tight hold, jostled with a foe late on the backstretch, steadied early on the turn, went three wide on that bend and came up
empty. EVE'S DELIGHT settled off the pace, went five wide under urging on the turn, moved out entering the final furlong and failed to respond. GIRL IN
BLACK stumbled at the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn and retreated. LADY CHURCHILL broke a bit
slow, dropped well behind the rest of the field, went two to three wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and showed little.
