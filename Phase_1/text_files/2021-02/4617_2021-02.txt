CAT IN THE PULPIT set a clear early pace, raced four wide into both turns, opened up in early stretch and held for the win. STREET BELLA tracked the
early pace, raced six wide through the second turn, was gaining late, was no match and finished second best. BEAUTIFUL BABE chased the early pace,
went five wide into the second turn, drifted out late and weakened. SARAH'S STAR was void of any speed, circled seven wide through the second turn and
passed tired rivals. LETHAL ENTITY was allowed to settle early, went three wide into the second turn and flattened out. PAJAMA QUEEN was unhurried
early, raced four wide into the second turn and never fired.
