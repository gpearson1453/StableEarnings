Footnotes
LUCRE was bumped at the start, pulled to a contending position, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch, responded to steady urging
and was up in the closing strides. ORIGINALY FROM DOT stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and
just missed. BEHIND THE COUCH was away in good order to dispute the early fractions while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the
three-eighths marker, responded when challenged by ORIGINALY FROM DOT and gave way grudgingly in the drive. FANCY PRINCESS dueled for the
lead from the inside and gradually gave way in the drive. PRINCESS ADIRA was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn
and failed to rally. OUR SWEET GIRL stumbled at the start and was bumped, lagged, raced five-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
LUXERO was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, checked nearing the half mile pole, angled out into the stretch, angled back inside nearing the sixteenth
pole and was up in the final yards. BANANAS ON FIRE stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths
marker, opened a clear margin into the lane but could not resist the winner late. GOLDEN WARRIOR lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and
finished with good late energy. ALPHA QUEUE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. SILVER
SUN settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, split rivals in mid-stretch and did not threaten. SPANISH D'ORO raced off the
pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. PIRATE'S PALACE disputed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened
after going a half.

Footnotes
AWARD WANTED settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, moved up to take command with a furlong to run, responded when
challenged by IMAGINE VICTORY nearing the sixteenth pole, vied with that foe and edged away late. IMAGINE VICTORY lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, offered a bid nearing the sixteenth pole, vied with the winner but could not get by that foe late.
ROCKSTAR GIRL was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, waited for racing room into the stretch, slipped through in mid-stretch and finished
willingly. WALK IT OUT NANNY set a pressured pace from off the rail and gave way after going three-quarters. CAR LADY was void of early speed, raced
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MALICEINTHEPALACE was off a step slow then allowed to settle, raced five-wide through the turn and did
not offer a bid. EMPERADORA chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters.

Footnotes
TOM TERRIFIC pressed the pace of NO FOOLING DUDE while racing three-wide, moved up to off a bid nearing the three-eighths marker, opened a clear
margin into the lane and held sway to the wire. BOUNCING AROUND was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not
gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to regain the place. GOLAZO settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out
further in mid-stretch, reached a striking position but failed to sustain his rally. COMMISSIONER BIGGS lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn,
angled out further with a furlong to run and finished evenly. NO FOOLING DUDE set a pressured pace from the inside for a half and gave way. JUSTICE
OF WAR was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MOTI raced unhurried early, checked into the stretch, angled out, split foes with a furlong to run, forged to the front and drew off with something left.
SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the second turn, was no match for the winner late but clearly second best. BRUTUS set a
pressured pace from the inside and gave way in the drive. ALWAYS FORGIVEN was off slow then allowed to settle, saved ground through the second turn,
remained inside for the drive, lacked room through the entire stretch drive and lost chance for better placing. HAYNE'S FEVER was reserved just off the
leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, lacked racing room into the stretch, angled in late and finished with good courage. INDIAN GHOST
pressed the pace while racing three-wide, offered a bid approaching the stretch and gave way in the drive. DASHING LOU settled off the leaders early,
moved six-wide through the second turn and failed to gain late. INSTIGATED pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the
quarter, gained a brief lead and weakened. EXTRA MEDIUM raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through
the second turn and weakened.

Footnotes
RUBBER BAND was off slow, moved up quickly to track the pace of DEGAS from the inside, angled outside that rival to offer a bid nearing the quarter and
steadily drew off. ICE RAIN settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and was up for the place.
DEGAS sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, gave way to the winner after going a half, stayed on well in the drive and was caught
late for the place. AND SEEK lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. GOODLUCKJOHNATHAN was forwardly
placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. DISPUTED NOTION raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground through the
turn, angled out into the stretch and did not threaten. PEACHY KEEN showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not reach
contention.

Footnotes
TONKA FLOWER sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when set down for the drive and held MOONACHIE
safe through the final furlong. MOONACHIE tracked the winner from the inside, angled outside that rival into the stretch, reached a striking position but
could not get by that foe through a prolonged drive. FAST CASH was bumped at the start, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn and finished
willingly in the drive. SUGAR DADDY was bumped at the start, chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gradually gave way. FUGITIVE settled off
the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and was not a factor. TASTES LIKE PLAID was bumped at
the break, showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and failed to menace. BEAR FORCE WON raced off
the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.

LOVE IS STRONG , patiently handled down the backstretch, eased out leaving the turn, gained command outside HELEN GIBSON approaching the
sixteenth pole then drew off. HELEN GIBSON sprinted to the early, set the pace near the rail, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened.
WRITTENBYTHESTARS stalked the pace and weakened. HALF EMPTY saved ground the far turn and failed to rally in an even effort. BOB'S LADY was no
factor. LOOKS DON'T LIE drifted wide on the far turn, gave way and was eased.
