Footnotes
CAPTUREMENOW angled to the rail in early stages tracking the leaders from out of striking distance into the backstretch, was prompted to advance along
the rail racing through the far turn to challenge for command inside the pacesetter while being bumped by that rival entering upper stretch, continued in a
protracted skirmish shifting out under left handed pressure continuing to exchange repeated contact through the closing stages but edged forward nearing
the wire. SHARON'S LAW, forwardly placed stalking a rival's pace to the backstretch, pressed the issue entering the far turn to go clear midway through the
second bend, shifted inwards racing into upper stretch making contact with the eventual winner, dueled with that rival past midstretch while continuing to
exchange contact to late stages but was just outkicked. TENERIFE MOON settled off the second flight outside rivals racing to the backstretch and continued
with an even effort to improve position between racing into the lane while gaining a share. MERICATHEBEAUTIFUL settled last racing to the backstretch,
angled out four wide nearing the lane and continued with a belated effort to gain some position. I AM A. LURING broke sharply to gain a clear advantage,
dictated the pace a bit off the rail racing to the far turn and gave way once headed midway through that bend. HIGHRHYTHMDIXIE tracked off the second
flight along the inside to the backstretch but offered no rally. UNITEDTORUN tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight, angled inside
racing through the far turn and steadily faded. R B C GOLD dropped out early.

Footnotes
CLARIST broke sharply, angled inwards to dictate the pace on a narrow margin between foes, met the challenge of DON'T MAKE ME BEG racing into the
stretch and held that rival gamely under firm handling to the wire. The latter, in touch with the winner three deep attending the pace, was urged to press the
issue racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to the end while proving only second best. SUGAR BRITCHES tracked off the first flight four wide
racing through the backstretch, angled inside the top pair entering upper stretch to challenge for command but lacked the needed final kick. CSILLA was
rated out of striking distance off the inside racing to the turn and continued to improve position between foes rivals just inside the leaders racing into the
lane. PRINCESS JAVONCIA angled to the inside, prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch and faded nearing upper stretch. SHE'S A PRINCESS
shifted off the inside while settling well off the leaders and never gained contention. ROSALDA proved no factor.

Footnotes
BUGLE OF WAR, forwardly placed stalking a rival's pace under light reserve racing to the backstretch, took over racing through the far turn and went well
clear in the stretch under firm left handed encouragement. CAPTAIN LAVA, caught in close quarters between, then forced out three deep racing into the first
turn, recovered to track the leaders outside a rival into the backstretch, then continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others while no threat to the
winner. YARROW was guided to the inside dropping well off the second flight leaving the chute, continued unhurried a bit off the rail racing into the far turn,
angled out five wide racing through the final three sixteenths and steadily gained position to the end. THE BEST DISTANCE angled to the inside early to
track the leaders as part of the second flight, saved ground on the far turn, shifted a bit off the inside entering the lane but continued evenly. FERMAT,
reserved outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was fanned six wide in the last furlong but made some belated progress. PITAMAN sped to
the fore while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing to the far turn but gave way once headed entering the stretch. RUSH
DELIVERY (IRE), held up avoiding traffic racing into the first turn, settled off the second flight and offered no rally. KARNAK, rank between foes under rating
racing to the first turn, dropped off the second flight entering the backstretch, shifted four wide nearing the lane and faded in the drive. SOAKING WET,
forced four wide avoiding close quarters racing into the first turn, was settled outside foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded
on the far turn. NAKODA was off slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
INEDATEQUILA, urged to the lead outside a rival racing to the first turn, dictated the pace between foes to the far turn, then was roused left handed to go
well clear racing through the stretch. MULBERRY switched outside the pacesetter racing through the first turn to track just off that foe three deep racing to
the far turn, was urged to challenge nearing upper stretch but proved no match while prevailing for the place honors. BIG BASE tracked off the first flight
four wide racing to the backstretch, then continued in that path to late stages to improve position earning a share. MINESHAFT MADNESS, urged to a
forward placing along the rail prompting the pacesetter to the far turn, faded into upper stretch. MARVELLA, restless in the gate, switched out five wide
tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch and continued evenly in that path to late stages. QUEEN OF CAUSE was rated between foes just off
the second flight racing to the backstretch and faded into upper stretch. STORMY BOSS was settled outside a rival in the last flight early and offered no
rally. SASSY MISS MARGIE settled along the inside and faded early.

Footnotes
ME AND MR. C, reserved in the opening stages while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted off the rail entering the far turn to split foes
nearing upper stretch, shifted four wide entering the lane while moving to challenge for command, then wrested the advantage and went clear under firm
encouragement. BILLY BATTS gained a forward placing tracking the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight, angled to the rail after a half tracking
just off the pacesetter, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, shifted out three wide racing into the lane to bid for command just inside the
eventual winner but proved only second best. FLY THE W angled to the inside leaving the chute to track the leaders as part of the second flight, conceded
some position under patient handling racing to the second bend, saved ground to upper stretch and continued inside foes to prevail for a share. CURRENT,
shuffled avoiding tight quarters at the start, settled last to the backstretch, switched outside foes after a half, was prompted to advance four, then five wide
through the far turn to upper stretch but continued with interest to gain position to the end. BIRD'S EYE VIEW settled inside foes behind the second flight
racing to the backstretch, passed inside tiring rivals in the closing stages. CHAPALU, pulling hard against restraint stalking just outside the first flight three
wide to the backstretch, moved to press the issue racing into the far turn but flattened out entering upper stretch. GRACEFUL KITTEN, urged inside a rival
disputing the pace from the outset to the backstretch, dispatched a rival after a half, continued to duel for command inside a rival into the far turn and gave
way in upper stretch. CASH LOGISTICS settled off the second flight racing three wide to the backstretch and offered no rally. LORD BARNA had his head
turned slightly, then hopped at the start to break a bit slowly, settled between foes racing to the backstretch, then was fanned wide into the stretch while
proving no threat. NOTORIOUS NICK, urged forcing a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, gave way abruptly after a half.

SPLASH CASH was urged to the lead along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin, edged away to a comfortable advantage racing through the
turn, the held sway to the end under firm right handed pressure. MAKE A SCENE ducked out at the start crossing into the path of ROYAL MISSION forcing
that foe into the path of SHE DAZZLE, was righted, then angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, shifted off the rail to bid
between foes in the stretch and edged a rival for the place honors late while failing to gain terms with the winner. SHE DAZZLE, carried out at the start, was
righted to track just off the leaders three wide racing into the turn, was urged to advance in that path into the lane but couldn't gain terms with the winner
while being just outkicked for second. STRIKING CHROME settled off the second flight racing through the backstretch, angled out four wide nearing the
lane and continued with an effort to gain position to the end. ROYAL MISSION, forced out at the start into the path of SHE DAZZLE, was righted, then urged
to gain a forward placing between foes tracking just off the pacesetter into the turn but steadily faded in the drive. ADMIRAL HOPPER hopped, then shied
outwards at the start, settled outside foes on the backstretch and never regained contention. MARKETABILITY, off slowly, was urged to a position inside
rivals tracking behind the second flight but faded early.

Footnotes
MY LIBERTY broke sharply, angled inwards leaving the chute dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn, shifted off the inside while being
roused to repel the challenge of DREAMING OF GERRY and gamely held that rival to the end under firm handling. The latter, in touch with the eventual
winner from the outset attending that rival's pace under light rating, was urged to press the issue into upper stretch while striking the front between calls but
was just outfinished. FLYING WITH ANGELS broke inwards bumping DANCE SOME MO, was righted to track just off the leaders between foes racing into
the turn, shifted inside the top pair when presented an opening racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap. WELL TOLD, held up out
of close quarters at the break, settled last through the backstretch, shifted out racing into the turn to make sharp progress four wide nearing upper stretch,
lugged inwards nearing midstretch, came under left handed correction in the last furlong but flattened out in the closing stages. VILLAGE PREACHER
tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight in the opening stages, was prompted to make brief progress three deep racing into the turn but faded foes
nearing upper stretch. SHOOTING, caught in close quarters racing past the chute, was held up off the second flight while pulling a bit racing through the
backstretch and never gained contention. DANCE SOME MO, a bit reluctant to load, was bumped at the start losing position to the leaders, was prompted
to make some brief progress inside foes gaining a position in the second flight racing to the turn but gave way nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
VICE GRIP gained a position just off the leaders racing four wide as part of the second flight in the opening quarter, was prompted to advance three wide
racing into the turn to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage while dropping over to the rail racing into upper stretch despite
firm left handed pressure, then just held the challenge of PURPLE PEOPLEEATER to the end under firm encouragement. The latter was urged to dispute
the pace inside a rival racing just off the rail through the backstretch, gained a narrow advantage after the opening quarter, then dispatched a challenger
racing into the turn, was headed while losing her path momentarily racing into upper stretch, switched outside the winner in the stretch and continued with a
solid second effort to close the gap late. CHATTIN WITH JENNY exchanged bumps with RUN AWESOME TIZ at the start, angled to the inside while being
urged to prompt the pacesetter racing into the turn, then faded into the stretch while lasting for a share. TETON THAI tracked off the first flight between foes
in the opening stages, angled to the inside entering turn and continued evenly late. STARSHIP PRANKSTER settled last while in hand racing through the
backstretch, split foes racing through the turn, then angled four wide in upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. RUN AWESOME TIZ exchanged
bumps at the start, tracked off the second flight in early stages, then angled five wide racing into the stretch while proving no threat. DYNAPOWER was
settled outside foes racing to the turn, was fanned six wide in upper stretch and proved no threat. RACE THE STORM tracked off the second flight inside
rivals but faded early. BLAZING DIVA proved no factor. RUN SNIP RUN shifted inwards while being urged to force the pace racing to the turn but was spent
early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF PURPLE PEOPLEEATER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
MUSETTA was rated between foes just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling into the second bend, split rivals just
off the inside advancing on the first flight nearing upper stretch, shifted out three deep midstretch to challenge and wrested the advantage under firm
handling. AGELESS ARTIST was held up just off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, split foes racing into the far turn to gain terms
with the pacesetter nearing the lane, pressed the issue to challenge for command racing through the stretch but was outkicked. IMPETUOSITY, urged to the
lead while angling to the inside leaving the chute, disputed the lead inside a rival through the backstretch, dispatched that foe into the far turn, dueled
grudgingly inside the top pair past midstretch but yielded late. TABLE ONE, reserved well off the leaders while angling inside early, steadily gained position
inside foes after a half, saved ground to upper stretch to bid inside the leaders but had no late kick. DOUBLE DOT tracked off the first flight outside a rival
racing to the backstretch, was fanned three wide between foes losing some position entering the far turn, steadied out of tight quarters momentarily nearing
upper stretch, then shifted four wide in the lane to regain position while no real threat. STARSHIP HARLEM, off slowly, was settled into stride off the inside
racing to the backstretch but never gained contention. STAR OF SHANGHAI angled to the inside tracking off the first flight but faded early. WHAT A
KNOCKOUT proved no factor. LUSTROUS, urged prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, gave way nearing upper stretch.
