Footnotes
CARRIBEAN CAPER pressed the pace on the outside then in the two to three path on the turn, took over in upper stretch, kicked clear outside the furlong
marker, powered away under a moderate hand ride into the final sixteenth then was eased up while much the best in a sparkling debut. FAMOUS
ATTRACTION was off slow and spotted the front a couple of lengths, settled on the outside, was roused while four then five wide on the turn, turned into the
stretch under a drive and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. ROOKERY brushed with a foe at the start, jostled with a rival early while
dropping towards the rear, went three wide under urging on the turn and narrowly missed the place while clear for the show. FIRINGTOTHEFRONT showed
good speed, set the pace under pressure by the winner to the outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage
under a drive in upper stretch and weakened. A REAL JEWEL was well placed down the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail under urging on
the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and came up empty. CANDYWRAPPER CRAZY chased the pace on the outside then three to four wide on the
turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. OUT LOUD brushed with a rival at the start, jostled with opponents early then was taken in hand, raced at
the rear, saved ground while unasked on the turn, came out into upper stretch and was no factor. PERFECT LIMIT jostled with a rival early, settled off the
pace, dropped back some leaving the backstretch, was roused while inside at the three-eighths then moved to the two path and failed to respond.

drew off under steady urging. SIENNA BREEZE tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased three wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive
into upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. RONNIE'S PESO bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, came out inside the
five-eighths pole and bumped with a foe, went three wide under urging on the turn and lacked the needed response while just up for the show. ROCKIN

Footnotes
RUN CLASSIC was hustled from the start, went three wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside, ranged up four wide on the far turn, took
the lead in the three path into upper stretch then drifted in while moving clear, responded well in the final furlong and proved much the best under steady
urging. CASH ROCKET was pulled out with a snatch of the right rein early, went two to three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, went two then three
wide early on the far turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths, moved to four wide late on that bend, pursued the winner under the whip into the final
furlong and proved no match while able to get the place. HAPPY AMERICAN bumped with foes at the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, lagged at
the rear, raced inside early on the turn then shifted three wide without being asked around the five-sixteenths, was roused at the quarter-pole, moved out
under a drive into the final furlong and got up for the show. ALEJANDRO stumbled at the start then bumped with a foe, saved ground on the first turn,
settled towards the rear, raced in the two path on the far turn, was roused inside the three-eighths and lacked the needed response. GOLDENITE was
hustled from the start, set the early pace in the two path, lost the lead late on the first turn, tracked the leader down the backstretch, made a bid at the
seven-sixteenths, took a narrow advantage in the three path at the three-eighths, dropped to the two path late on the far turn, lost the lead to the winner into
upper stretch and tired. CHROME FINISH broke in and brushed the gate then bumped with a foe, went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was
roused near the half-mile pole, went three to four wide under urging on the far turn and failed to respond. GREY STORM went five wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, was roused near the half-mile pole, went five wide under urging on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
CONSTITUENCY bumped with a foe at the start, was taken up while in tight early then climbed behind horses briefly, went three to four wide on the turns,
came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. GHOSTLINER bumped with a foe at the start, was taken in hand early then became rank under stout
restraint into and early on the first turn, moved through along the rail to take the lead late on that bend then went clear, lost the advantage under urging
while inside at the three-eighths, dropped back into the stretch and faded.

SAINTHOOD went to the front, dropped from the three path to the two path on the first turn, set the pace under some urging, was urged along passing the
half-mile pole, vied in the path under a strong hand ride on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, drifted out coming to the furlong marker then
lost the advantage to the runner-up shortly thereafter, battled back gamely on the outside of that foe into the final sixteenth and won the head-bob on the
wire to narrowly prevail. DOLDER GRAND saved ground on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, came under urging while inside to the two path on the
far turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, gained to take the lead under a strong drive just inside the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth but
was out-nodded on the wire and denied but clear for the place. MASQUEPARADE went four then three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the
outside, was asked three wide on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch, chased the top two under a drive into the final furlong and was
outfinished but clear for the show. TIWANAKU rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused while two then three wide on the far
turn, swung five wide into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick. COOL RAGS was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, saved
ground at the rear on the turns, turned into the stretch in the two path and lacked the needed response. CROSS CHECK broke a step slow, went three wide
on the first turn, settled near the back, was urged three wide early on the far turn, moved to five wide at the five-sixteenths and failed to threaten. CODY'S
LEGACY was rank off heels under tight restraint while three to two wide on the first turn, moved out early on the backstretch, was let out near the half-mile
pole then dropped back, came up empty while three to four wide on the far turn and retreated. OLYMPIC CHAMPION fought the rider while rank under
restraint on the initial straightaway, raced inside early on the first turn then moved three wide, shifted four wide late on that bend then came further out,
moved up early on the backstretch then quickly dropped back again, fell well behind the rest of the field and faltered.

JUST MIGHT quickly sped clear, dictated terms while inside through the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, was given a couple light taps
of a down-turned whip outside the furlong marker and drew off under a moderate hand ride to win ridden out. EXTRAVAGANT KID bumped with a rival at
the start while last away, was reserved at the rear of the field, came under urging in the three path on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, moved out
while asked for his best at the three-sixteenths and got up for the place. WENT WEST was rated on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was
urged three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. MANNY WAH was taken in hand
early then settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and lacked the
needed response. BANGO was hustled from the start then taken in hand briefly when the winner crossed in front, chased the pace down the backstretch,
went around the turn in the two path, pursued the winner under a drive into upper stretch and tired. ARCHIDUST bumped with a rival at the start, was
reserved under a tight hold, went around the turn in the two path while let out and failed to respond.

on the outside and closed with a rush but missed while clear for the place. GAGETOWN broke in and bumped with a foe, was keen under restraint in the

way. ROOM TO FINISH saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, raced inside early on the far turn then moved to the two path, was roused
around the five-sixteenths and failed to rally. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS' POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF JOY

power on the far turn, gained fast on the tiring pacesetter to make a bid at the five-sixteenths, took over while put to a drive in upper stretch, shook clear into
the final furlong and drew away while kept to the task. SONNEMAN bumped with foes on both sides early then was taken back between horses, raced in the
two path on the first turn, was reserved towards the back, moved closer while two then three wide on the far turn, shifted out under a drive in upper stretch
and got up for the place. CHESS CHIEF was hustled from the start, settled on the inside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, raced inside for most
of the far turn then shifted to the two path while getting much closer, dropped back into upper stretch, moved out in the final furlong and gained some ground
late to get the show. BLACKBERRY WINE broke out at the start, bumped with a rival early, went three wide on the first turn, was rated well behind the
runaway leader in second, gained on that foe under his own power while two then three wide on the far turn, took the lead inside the five-sixteenths, lost the
advantage to the winner in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong then moved out and weakened. ENFORCEABLE saved ground on the first turn,
was reserved at the back, came under urging midway down the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and
lacked the needed response. DINAR bumped with a foe early then went clear, raced in the two path on the first turn, drew off to a huge advantage, saw the
lead diminish quickly while inside on the far turn, was asked under major danger outside the five-sixteenths then lost the lead inside that marker and tired.

the far turn, gained to get the lead in upper stretch, disposed of MIDNIGHT BOURBON under the whip into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand

pole under urging, went three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and finished with good courage for the
place. MIDNIGHT BOURBON went three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader while two to three wide on the
far turn, took a short lead outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final sixteenth and
was outfinished while well clear for the show. O BESOS went four wide on the first turn, settled in the middle of the field, was ridden along while four to five
wide on the far turn, drifted out some outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. SENOR BUSCADOR went four wide on the first turn, settled
well back on the outside, passed foes while urged five wide on the far turn, was driven seven wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
RIGHTANDJUST was hustled from the start, angled in while going to the front, set the pace on the inside, was asked when challenged on the far turn, lost
the advantage outside the quarter-pole, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way. SANTA CRUISER went five wide on the first turn, settled in the back
half of the field on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the far turn then driven four wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
SERMONONTHEMOUNT went three wide on the first turn, settled near the back, was urged while three then two wide on the far turn and was no factor.
STARRININMYDREAMS was off a couple of lengths slow, became rank under restraint early, lugged out into the first turn, went three then two wide on that
bend, was rated off the pace then leveled out before the half-mile pole, saved ground on the far turn and also failed to respond. CARILLO saved ground on
the first turn, was reserved well back in the field, moved from the two path to the four path under urging on the far turn and showed little. BEEP BEEP
bumped with a foe at the start, was taken back early then carried out into the first turn, went four then three wide on that bend, was reserved off the pace,
