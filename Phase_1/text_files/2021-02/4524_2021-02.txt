stretch and held. ROMAN RUSH raced in mid pack early, advanced along the inside into the turn, angled out through the turn, was closing late and just
missed. MR. BENZ was void of any early speed, raced between rivals into the turn, angled towards the inside and was gaining late. FAIR CHALLENGE was
outrun early, circled seven wide through the turn and offered no late rally. FLY FIRST CLASS followed the early pace, went six wide into the turn and was
empty late. UNLEASH THE BEAST set a clear early pace from off the rail and weakened. EMPEROR'S CHOICE was always outrun.
