MAXIMUS THE GREAT dropped back early, moved up five wide nearing the eighth pole and finished well to just get up under strong ecnouragement.
SOUTHERN MOJO was hustled along from the outside, raced four in the upper stretch and just missed in a game effort. UPPERCLASSMAN showed good
speed from the inside, led deep stretch but couldn't hold off the top pair late in a game effort. FREE MUSIC stalked the pace while racing between rivals,
raced three wide in the stretch and had not enough in the drive. WILD DRIVE dropped back early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. HOT
BLOODED SONG was hustled along from the inside and had no response.

APPROVAL stalked the pace, moved up three wide to take command into the upper stretch but couldn't hold off the winner in the latter stages to finish
second best. BUTTON MUSHROOM was slow early on, moved up three wide to split rivals in the stretch and showed good late interest. MONGOL CALL
stalked the pace, raced towards the inside throughout and had no final winning bid. DIVA'S DIVA raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a
factor. PERSONAL CAT pressed the pace and gave way. T. P. RIGHT LANE showed good early speed and tired readily.

the pace, raced three wide around the far turn through the stretch, lacked racing room at the eighth pole and had not enough late. VICTORY ROSE was
allowed to settle early, raced towards the inside, raced in tight quarters nearing the sixteenth pole and never threatened. AQUINA'S ADVICE showed good
early speed while racing two wide and gave way. SHELL LOCKET dropped back early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never menaced.
