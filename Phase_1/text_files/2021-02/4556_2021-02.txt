Footnotes
TAKE ME HOME rated just off the early pace, closed to the lead past the quarter pole and drew off while mostly in hand. YESTERDAYSPLAN dropped
back off the early pace and rounded the first turn in the three path, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn,
dueled for second mid-stretch but was no match for the winner. SURFER GIRL CENTS settled inside off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, then yielded second after a brief stretch duel. BIRD TRAFFIC saved ground off the pace, gave chase
nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and showed little more. DON'T SPIN ME rated a clear lead inside, came under pressure
toward the three eighths pole and was caught past the quarter, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn then weakened.

Footnotes
KIM'S DIAMOND stalked off the rail then challenged from the seven sixteenths pole, took the nod leaving the three eighths and dueled clear midway on the
far turn, then extended the advantage under steady encouragement. SPOOKY MOON stalked toward the inside, picked up the chase approaching the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, left the far turn three wide and dug in to take second later yards while gaining on the winner. CHARITABLE
MISS rounded the first turn in the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced three wide on the far turn, was outfinished for second, though,
took over third later yards. SHARP'S MISSION took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and rated a short lead inside, came under pressure toward the
seven sixteenths pole, gave up the nod past the three eighths, continued close to mid-stretch then weakened. STERLINGS MORENA saved ground.
WORKPANSOMETHINGS raced just off the early pace the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened into the far turn.
CELIA'S PRIDE was unprepared for the break, reared at the start and lost the rider out of the gate.

Footnotes
LADY MACHO stalked in the three path early on, closed to the front approaching the quarter pole and raced clear midway on the far turn, then drew off
under steady stretch encouragement. HOSS KITTEN exchanged sharp contact with Catherines Warrior leaving the gate and settled off the pace about the
three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three and four paths of the far turn but was no match in the stretch. SECRET ACCOUNT saved
ground off the pace, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, lost ground on the far turn and entered the stretch about the five path, then
flattened stride. MACKENZIE'S STAR broke awkwardly and saved ground the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was carried
out on the far turn and entered the stretch in the six path, and showed little further. COOLER SCHEDULE stalked two deep, challenged leaving the seven
sixteenths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. GLORIOUS MYSTERY angled to the inside to rate the pace, was pressured toward the seven
sixteenths pole, gave up the lead approaching the quarter then weakened on the far turn. CATHERINES WARRIOR exchanged contact with Hoss Kitten
leaving the gate, gave chase through the first turn then faded down the backstretch.

JAMESTOWN ROAD rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, opened up at the rail on the far turn and was steadily
handled in the stretch. CEDARS BULLS EYE raced off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn in the three path, drifted toward the head of the lane and had to settle for second best. TIZBIT raced in the four and five paths the first turn, bid
nearing the three eighths pole, ran through the far turn in the five path then flattened stride. MY PRETTY EYES raced in the four path the first turn and
settled close into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back at the rail on the far turn and weakened the final
furlong. LONG LEGS LOUISE stalked off the rail then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded into the far turn. ARROWWOOD
saved ground into the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. DYLADDIE rounded the opening turn in the five path and raced outside
into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then faded on the far turn. REAL APPEAL settled off the early pace in the three path then
faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
RAGTIME COWBOY JOE saved ground off the early pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn, dug in from the head
of the lane to take the lead inside the sixteenth pole and widened nearing the wire. MORE PLEASE stalked the earlier pace about the three path, bid leaving
the three eighths pole and took the lead in the three path past the three sixteenths pole, but was caught inside the sixteenth pole and flattened stride later
yards. SHORTLISTER rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and yielded the advantage nearest the rail past the
three sixteenths, then flattened out through the lane. NOT TELLING stalked two deep then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close two
deep on the far turn but weakened into the lane. GREY INVASION rounded the opening turn about the five path, picked up the chase into the backstretch
then flattened stride in the five path of the far turn. COWTOWN TAPIT came away a step slow, rounded the first turn in the six path, raced outside into the
backstretch and showed little response. DUNLUCE CAISSLE broke a step slow and raced well back. FOR ARTS SAKE raced off the rail the first turn and
showed little response down the backstretch. This race was hand timed.
