Footnotes
EVER FOR EVER EVER broke well and dueled with inside rival on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and shook clear at top of the stretch, extended
lead through the stretch and won driving. ENTREZ NOUS chased duo inside of rival on the backstretch, entered turn along the rail and eased out into the
two path in the stretch, finished well to get up for second late. LUNADEMIEL off bit slow at the start, recovered well to contend with rival for lead along the
inside, entered turn along the rail and unable to match strides with dueling rival late in the turn, kept on well enough in the stretch and just edged out at the
wire for second. POLITICAL LOOPHOLE chased leaders three wide on the backstretch, dropped back a touch on the turn and took most of the turn in the
two path, eventually angling to the rail, failed to launch a rally in the stretch and finished one paced. BOLD EAGLE chased two wide on the backstretch,
entered two wide on the turn and steadily faded starting midway on the turn.
