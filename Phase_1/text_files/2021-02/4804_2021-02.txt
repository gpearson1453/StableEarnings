Footnotes
CIOPPINO PASADINO dueled throughout on the outside of TIGER MOM, entered stretch with a head margin and gamely held off rival the entire stretch.
TIGER MOM dueled inside of rival on the backstretch, continued to duel on the turn and into the stretch, unable to make up any ground through the lane in a
game effort. SATURNCLOUD chased dueling leaders along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, angled three wide in the
stretch and finished up evenly. LUV IS ALL U NEED stalked leaders along the inside on the backstretch, continued to save ground into the turn and into the
stretch, made mild late progress in the lane. AVALON RIDE off slow, lacked speed and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN FURY led inside of rivals on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside, drifted out slightly into the stretch, entered stretch in the two path, met
bids from either side and gamely prevailed. LOST THE MINISTER pressed leader two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, entered stretch in the
three path and took aim on leader, made up minimal ground and held place. SEVENTH WAVE off slow, still able to get in a chasing position along the inside
when no one went to rail early, continued along the rail on the turn, found room along the inside in the stretch but unable to make enough progress to
improve position. UP TIME bumped at the start by inside rival, found a comfortable stride and tracked leaders two wide on the backstretch, continued two
wide on the turn and had every opportunity in the stretch but only managed to best the rest of the field. GEOCAS STREET broke out and bumped rival at
the start, found tracking position along the rail on the backstretch, continued along the rail on the turn and finished up one paced in the stretch. ZINZAN
stalked leaders off the rail on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and lacked needed response in the stretch.
