Footnotes
CREEDS REVENGE set all the pace, raced just off the inside through the stretch and drew off in the latter stages to be well clear under steady handling.
MR. BIG SHOT pressed the pace from the inside and was no match for the winner in the drive. RAGTOP RED stalked the early top pair, raced three deep in
the lane and had not enough. LEON'S DIAMOND dropped back early and failed to respond. PETE AND REPETE was slow early on and never threatened.
Official race time was hand timed.
