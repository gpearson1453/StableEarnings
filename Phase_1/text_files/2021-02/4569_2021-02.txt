Footnotes
GIRL DAD stalked two wide, vied outside of INDOCTRINATE around the far turn, forged an advantage from that foe entering the lane, and drew off through
the final furlong. INDOCTRINATE set the pace along the inside, showed the way feeling stern pressure from the eventual winner around the far turn, got
headed by that foe in upper stretch, gave way passing the furlong grounds, then tired, but held place. PUBLIC INFORMATION stumbled at the start but was
not severely costed early position, tracked from midpack three wide and between horses, tipped four wide turning for home, and offered a mild kick to reach
show approaching the wire. THE GREAT OZ stalked three wide, but failed to keep pace with the leading pair turning for home, chased those foes through
the lane, but was outfinished for show. PROVEN INNOCENT took up when in a bit tight quarters between horses soon after the start, trailed in the three to
four path around the first turn, swung six wide turning for home while progressing mildly, and stayed on outside of foes through the lane. BILLY YANK
tracked from midpack along the inside into the first turn, tugged forward between horses when the pace was backed down into the backstretch, tracked two
wide and from between horses around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leaders turning for home, and chased them home while fading. CITY
MAGIC tracked from midpack while caught four wide around both turns, got floated five wide entering the lane, and lacked a rally while hanging on his left
lead. BIG BLUE saved ground far off of the pace, then split foes two wide in midstretch, but failed to reach contention. UNCUT GEM lied off of the pace
along the inside, but pulled very keenly when the pace slowed into the backstretch, was hand to handle and steadied severely due to the incident, then
steadied again at the half mile pole, and failed to factor thereafter. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid before fading
turning for home, and weakened through the lane. SUPERPOSITION was last away, lied off of the pace while caught four to five wide around the turns, and
never got involved. SPHEROID lied off of the pace three wide around both turns, and was done early.

HARD GAME settled off the early pace inside, angled three wide entering the turn, steadily gained around the bend, took a short lead three deep near the
quarter pole, dueled from there and dug in to edge ahead late. GREYZER stalked the pace three wide down the backstretch, bid two wide between foes
around the far turn, battled on between through the lane and gave way grudgingly. ONEMORETIMEAROUND stalked the pace inside, angled four wide
near the quarter pole, had aim outside of the battling trio in upper stretch, stuck on the left lead through the lane and was outfinished. UNCAPTURED
SOLDIER set the pace along the rail, fought on inside of rivals to deep stretch and yielded late. KICKS ON SIXTY SIX had some speed two wide down the
backstretch, dropped back around the turn and finished evenly. CUATE was ridden along four wide around the turn, had no response and was eased.

Footnotes
NOBLE EMPIRE took a minor bump from an inner foe at the start, pressed the pace two wide, vied for the lead around the bend, forged an advantage
turning for home, then drove clear passing the furlong grounds, and held safely thereafter. NEVERSTOPDREAMING lied forwardly placed three wide, came
under coaxing into the turn to keep pace with NOBLE EMPIRE, then chased that foe through the lane, and reached place while making mild progress on
that foe's margin in the late stages. NEW YORK STYLE rushed to set the pace along the inside, vied inside of the eventual winner around the turn, but was
headed by that foe turning for home, and tired through the lane. TIZ LIGHT THE WAY bumped an outer foe at the start, tracked from midpack along the
inside, then surpassed a tiring foe for a minor reward without threatening. EL ZEUS lied off of the pace four wide around the turn, and never factored. ROAD
TO PEACE was always outrun.

Footnotes
BOURBON IN MAY was unhurried while racing two wide early, advanced four wide between rivals around the far turn, waited for room nearing the lane,
split rivals in upper stretch, surged outside and was up on the wire. SOGLIO was bumped at the start, raced closest to the runoff pacesetter while saving
ground, took over near the three-eighths marker, set a pressured pace at the rail rounding the far turn, drew off in upper stretch, held clear to deep stretch,
drifted out a bit under steady left-handed urging late and was nailed on the wire. BASHA saved ground well back, advanced two wide around the far turn,
swung widest nearing the lane and rallied for the show. RIJEKA (IRE) was bumped at the start, lagged far back while racing two and three wide, circled six
wide around the far turn to reach contention but flattened out a bit late. THEREGOESJOJO raced off the pace three wide, moved up between foes to reach
contention in the lane and evened out late. CASH CALL KITTEN never threatened while racing four and five wide. MORNING STRIDE settled off the
runaway pacesetter three wide, bid outside of SOGLIO nearing the three-eighths pole, pressed two wide around the far turn and tired in the drive.
ARTEMUS BRIDGE failed to menace while racing three and four wide. APRECIADO raced off the pace four wide, bid nearing the far turn then faded three
wide around that bend. OVER THE CHANNEL was rank rounding the first turn, raced two wide and made little impact. MINISTER'S STRIKE was rank at the
start, saved ground and was outrun. IMPERIAL MISSION set the pace off the rail, ran off to a sizeable lead the first time through the stretch, stopped
midway down the backstretch and was eased.

AUGUSTA MELODY set the pace along the inside, drew away from a pressing rival turning for home, and widened under driving pressure through the lane.
MUTAKAAMIL saved ground far off of the pace, and passed a tiring foe along the rail in the final furlong to achieve place. COMMISSIONER G broke well
but was quickly out-footed, took the turn far off of the pace two wide, shifted three wide in upper stretch, and passed a tired foe without threatening. MAGIC
ECLIPSE pressed the eventual winner from the outside, but failed to keep pace with that foe turning for home, and weakened through the lane. DUE TO A
TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED, INTERNAL FRACTIONS ARE UNAVAILABLE.

GREAT ISLAND stumbled twice at the start to immediately drop far back, saved ground trailing around the first turn, angled widest early on the backstretch,
cruised up outside into contention, moved into a clear second in the three path rounding the far turn, drifted out a bit under left-handed urging in upper
stretch, straightened out under right-handed pressure in midstretch, closed steadily and was up in the final strides. DROP A HINT set the pace along the
rail, drew clear around the far turn, held clear past the sixteenth pole, drifted out late and was nailed on the wire. MYLASTFIRSTKISS steadied along inside
through the opening quarter, angled out to race four wide around the far turn and rallied widest in the lane. TILTINGATWINDMILLS stalked the pace two
wide, saved ground in range around the far turn, tipped back out turning for home, remained up close to midstretch then weakened. LOVING MOMENT
tracked the pace three wide around the first turn, bid nearing the far turn, dropped back two wide around that bend and went evenly through the lane.
MAKEME DREAM played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
DEMOCRACY broke inwards and a step slowly, rushed between horses steadily making up ground through the backstretch, stalked the dueling leaders
from the four path around the turn, then sustained a grinding advance through the lane, produced a late bid outside of the tiring leader, got bumped
approaching the wire by that foe, but still just got up. JEEBAR prompted the pace two wide, stayed in the four path around the turn, forged an advantage at
the five sixteenths pole before drawing off turning for home, built a clear margin in midstretch, but tired in the final furlong, drifted out approaching the wire,
bumped DEMOCRACY, but was still nailed on the wire by that foe. BEARS WATCHING lied forwardly placed four wide, tracked the pace around the turn
while shifting down from the five path, came into the lane two wide, sustained a rally aiming to split the leaders in the late stages, then lost his path when
inner leader drifted out, shifted ground inwards without steadying, and stayed on but would not have caught them without the incident. BUCK MOON was
reluctant to load, then stalked the pace three wide, stayed in the five path around the turn, was outkicked by DEMOCRACY to his inside turning for home,
but still sustained a steady grind outside of foes through the lane as the leaders tired, but did not have enough to catch them. COLLABORATE was off a
step slow and encountered rider encouragement to stay in the game, advanced mildly before taking the turn in the four path while off of the pace, improved
to a tracking position turning for home, then sustained a grinding rally between horses through the lane, but failed to produce a late bid. BLACK BELT broke
outwards, tracked from midpack three wide around the turn, cut the corner turning for home, but was outkicked by outer foes, and failed to menace. NACO
set the pace along the inside while a path off of the inner railing, got headed by JEEBAR at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened on his left lead in upper
stretch. DUPUIS lied far off of the pace four wide around the turn, and never got involved. CAMPEADOR broke well but was quickly outsprinted in the
opening furlong, took the turn at the rear of the field three wide and between horses, and did not make an impact. MUSK lied far off of the pace three wide
around the turn, and was outrun. MO MORE raced midpack along the inside into the turn, but weakened at the three furlong pole, and was done early. TIZ A
PRINCE bobbled at the start and was outrun along the inside.

YODEL E. A. WHO was urged from the gate but outsprinted down the backstretch, advanced three wide between rivals around the far turn, seized
command near the three-sixteenths marker and drew clear under a drive. THE TABULATOR brushed with WITH VERVE at the start, advanced four wide
around the turn, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the winner in the lane but stayed on to be clearly second best. WHERE
PARADISE LAY pressed the pace two wide, briefly led near the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep pace with the top two nearing the lane, shifted out in
upper stretch and held third. WITH VERVE was brushed at the start, lacked speed inside, angled out nearing the lane and never threatened. POSITIVELY
AWESOME set the pace along the rail and tired midway around the turn. JOE DI BAGGIO was outrun while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
R MERCEDES BOY stalked the leading pair of duelers from the three path around the turn, ranged up to them three wide turning for home while hand,
assumed control in upper stretch, and drew off through the final furlong. WHISKEY SUNRISE dueled along the inside, but was outkicked by an outer rallying
foe passing the three sixteenths pole, dug in for place inside of his early dueling counterpart, tired in the late stages, but still saved that position from a pair
of enclosing rivals. TONALISM lied far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, then stayed on through the lane inside of KAUFY BEAN in pursuit of
tiring foes for place, but just ran out of ground to achieve that position. KAUFY BEAN lied far off of the pace in the five path around the turn, then stayed on
willingly outside of foes through the lane while on his left lead. KING SNAKE bumped an outer foe at the start, dueled for the lead outside of WHISKEY
SUNRISE, but was outkicked by an outer foe passing the three sixteenths pole, continued to vie for place into the late stages while tiring, but was
outfinished by a pair of outer foes for a minor placing. SANDYS BLAZE took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, lied far off of the pace while
staying a path from the rail around the turn, then lacked a bid while hanging on his left lead through the lane. CHIEF HOWCOME took a bump to his hind
quarters at the start, lied forwardly placed in the three path early on, but weakened into the turn, and steadily faded thereafter.

PROMISE KEEPER set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. MUTASALLEM was sluggish early, angled five wide nearing the three-eighths
pole and rallied outside to be clearly second best. HIGHER QUALITY was bumped between rivals at the start, was in range outside early, dropped back
under some urging down the backstretch, gained four wide around the turn, was no match for the winner but stayed on to hold the show. TALLIS chased the
pace three wide and came up empty in the final furlong. TAITA saved ground and failed to menace. DR. ROGER played no factor while racing four wide.
KING FORCE broke a bit awkwardly, raced two wide and was outrun while racing two wide. MYSTERY MO was bumped at the start, saved ground and
made little impact. COURAGEOUSLY steadily faded inside. DRUM AND DRUMMER had early speed three wide, retreated around the turn and was eased.
BOURBON HIGHWAY took an awkward stride leaving the chute and unseated the rider, galloped along with the field and walked off. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT LEAVING THE CHUTE AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
LADY'S ISLAND was sent after a bit of a flat-footed start, set the pace inside of the pressing HEAR MY PRAYER around the turn while staying a path off of
the rail, inched clear while shifting to the four path straightening into the lane, held that clear margin while drifting outwards at the sixteenth marker, and
safely kept chasing rivals at bay. MISS AURAMET tracked from midpack in the three path around the turn, shifted to the six path turning for home while
inching closer to the leading duo, then sustained a grinding rally outside of those rivals through the lane, but did not have enough to reach the leader while
achieving place. HEAR MY PRAYER pressed LADY'S ISLAND while kept in the three path around the turn by that rival, got floated out to the five path
entering the lane, chased the leader through upper stretch she inched away, then shifted inside of that foe at the sixteenth marker, but was outfinished by an
outer foe for place. A BIT OF BOTH lied far off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four path turning for home while commencing a rally, then to the
seven path approaching the furlong pole to be outside of the leaders, and finished up willingly, but was no threat. LAGERTHA (CHI) lied off of the pace in
the four path around the turn, shifted down approaching the quarter pole to cut the corner turning for home, but failed to factor. DOUBLE MEDAL trailed the
field in the three path around the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
LALALI was in range inside, angled four wide near the quarter pole, drifted out under left-handed urging nearing the eighth pole, straightened out under
right-handed urging leaving that marker and drove clear. COOKIE COVE pressed the pace two wide, took the lead leaving the three-eighths pole, ceded the
advantage nearing the quarter pole, fought back inside to regain the lead in upper stretch, battled past the eighth pole but was no match for the winner late.
MISS OVER THERE settled off the early pace three wide, moved to the front nearing the quarter pole, battled to midstretch and weakened in the final
furlong. SIMPLE STORY was in range three wide and lacked the needed rally. BEASAICHI failed to menace while racing four wide. WICKED SPIRIT played
no factor while racing four wide. HARTS N FLOWERS trailed inside for a half, swung out nearing the lane and was no threat. GRAVEL GERTIE chased the
pace four wide and came up empty in the drive. SHELLPHONE saved ground and made little impact. GALIT JAK was outrun inside. FLYING SOFIA set the
pace along the rail, gave way readily and was eased in the lane.
