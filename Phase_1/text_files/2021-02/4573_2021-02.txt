DOUBLE D'S REVENGE close up just behind the top pair, waited on the turn, shifted out four wide entering the stretch, dug un determinedly and was along
in time. DANCIN' ROSIE dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch, edged clear late and just missed hanging on. SISTER'S CREED pressed the
pace two wide into the turn, put a head in front, dueled until deep stretch then was outfinished. STATUS SYMBOL stalked the early pace, bid four wide
nearing the tip of the stretch then came up empty. CHECK OUT LINE inched closer outside on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. MY BELLE
MICHELLE was squeezed at the start and outrun. CANDY LANE close up, was through after a half.

Footnotes
MOR BREEZE broke in front, set all the pace and drew away late under a brisk hand ride. SAFFRON GIRL chased her stablemate the entire trip and
finished second best. AND I KNOW unhurried early, was steadily gaining ground late in the three path. NATALIA'S TEMPLE failed to menace. TEJATE
pressed the winner through the clubhouse turn from the inside, chased that one into the stretch then weakened. PERSONALLY was no factor. FORWARD
LOOK was never close. HOPES AND PRAYERS swung wide and was through after half. BELLY FLOP had speed for six furlongs then stopped.

CHARCOAL away alertly, set all the pace and finished full of run to win as much the best while in hand late. GRANDGRAN stalked then chased the winner
and finished second best. RAKEEZ never far back, offered a mild bid along the inside into the stretch then leveled off. KENYA ROAD failed to menace.
CANDY KINGDOM broke inward bumping rivals at the start then was never close. MOST SANDISFACTORY was bumped at the start, pressed the early
pace and was through after a half. SLATE was bumped at the start then no threat. ADANO checked entering the clubhouse turn, had speed for a half then
wilted. DIGITAL STAR had brief speed. TOM refused to break, jogged around the track and was walked off.

Footnotes
THURSDAY FROST sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, turned back a strong bid from the runner up nearing the top of the stretch, was
well handled and drew off to win in hand. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE chased the winner into the turn, drew on even terms for the lead nearing the top of the
stretch, drifted in when struck with a right handed whip at the furlong marker then was no match for the winner. SKIPSHOT LILLY stalked the pace in an
even effort. LOOSE IN PARADISE failed to menace. OHIO STORM settled mid pack and lacked the needed response. MIZZEN SPOILS passed tiring
rivals. PERFECT ILLUSION was no threat. WELLOILEDCAT was outrun. RACEY WEEKEND was no factor.
