mid-stretch and drew away later yards. SHE GIVES ME FITS rated a slim lead inside from the five eighths pole, was met nearing the seven sixteenths and
contested the rail on the far turn, gave up the lead mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. WELL SPENT stalked from the three path the first turn then
moved to even terms toward the seven sixteenths pole, contested the far turn two deep but weakened in the lane. LANESBOROUGH saved ground the first
turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, but drifted into the stretch and showed little more. TUESDAY'S ROSE broke a
step slow and rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little
further.

CHARITABLE ANY took the lead leaving the chute and set a clear pace inside, came under pressure into the turn, widened on the turn and was much the
best under steady handling. IRISH KNOCKOUT stumbled at the break then gave chase through the backstretch, dug in leaving the turn and just lasted in
second. GOT ANY gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn and just missed second under steady handling. HOLY HOT LEGS chased inside, raced at
the rail on the turn and ran evenly down the lane. TAPTAP chased the early pace outside, saved ground on the turn, eased outward in the upper stretch and
finished evenly. RED HOT COOKIE chased and raced at the rail on the turn. FIFTY GRAY SHADES chased toward the outside, drifted on the turn and
entered the stretch about the seven path.

QUICK ENERGY rated the early pace inside and was met approaching the seven sixteenths pole, dueled from that point and raced near the rail on the far
turn, recovered the edge at the rail toward the head of the lane and dug in determinedly to hold off the game stretch effort of CASTLE OF CAYLEE, who
stalked off the rail then challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, dueled with a slim lead two deep on the far turn, yielded the nod toward the head of the
lane but continued on gamely to the finish. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE saved ground early on then bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved at the rail on the
far turn, eased outward through the stretch and flattened stride later yards. HATTA DOUBLE steadied early then raced well back from early contention, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, angled to the five path approaching the top of the stretch and was gaining on third
while finishing evenly. BUFF N stumbled leaving the gate and raced in the five path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
continued in the five path of the far turn then flattened stride. ELLIE BEAR stalked the earlier pace in the four path, picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole and raced close through the backstretch, then faded approaching the head of the lane. LIMEHOUSE LOUISE raced well off the pace and
showed little response through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the six path and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
SOCIAL CHIC rounded the opening turn about the three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole,
drew to even terms midway on the far turn and took the nod toward the eighth pole, dueled clear mid-stretch then drew off later yards. UNCLE FUNKY
lunged from the gate then moved to the rail and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met midway on the far turn then
caught toward the eighth pole, dropped back mid-stretch and flattened stride. ISHIHARA raced well off the pace about the three path the first turn, left the
turn outside and picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path, though, flattened later yards. NO CHANGE
raced well back saving early ground, bid only mildly from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little more. SPURN stalked two
deep then challenged toward the three eighths pole, engaged in close chase from that point but dropped back approaching the quarter pole, raced at the rail
on the far turn then weakened. SHUTUPN'KISSME steadied into the first turn then rated just off the pace through the turn, was eased three wide into the
backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path of the far turn.

Footnotes
TARA'S Z VA chased outside, raced in the seven path of the turn then dug in to take over the final yards. FRIENDLY FAIRBANKS chased through the
backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path, was carried out toward the head of the lane, dueled between horses mid-stretch and was outfinished
the final sixteenth. NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE chased inside and raced at the rail on the turn, took the lead inside the eighth pole but was outfinished in the
final sixteenth. LINEAGE stumbled at the break but gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and raced close to mid-stretch
before flattening stride. EXTRAVAGANT MISS was shuffled back on the chute and settled into stride early on, picked up the chase from the three eighths
pole, rounded the turn about the six path, drifted wider into the lane and passed rivals in an even finish. COSMOHEART chased inside, raced at the rail on
the turn and ran evenly in the lane. HIDE chased the leaders and raced in the four path of the turn, then weakened. TRACI'S GIRL surged clear past the
half mile pole and set a pressured pace, raced near the rail on the turn but drifted outward toward the top of the stretch, was caught past the eighth pole and
weakened. HICKORY MADE saved ground on the turn. TRINNI SOPHIA was never a factor and rounded the turn in the six path.
