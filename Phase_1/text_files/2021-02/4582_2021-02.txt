JOYMAKER was unhurried while trailing to the second turn, circled five wide while rallying to the stretch then caught LA REINE'S LEGACY leaving mid
stretch and won going away. LA REINE'S LEGACY set the pace off the rail for six furlongs, responded to urging to mid stretch then could not hold the
winner but was easily second best. KATE BOSS broke inward and checked, stalked the pace to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch but lacked a
closing response. SANDY SUNSHINE was four wide on both turns and came up empty in the drive. REINA DE REYES pressed the pace for five furlongs
then tired and stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
NINA EN FUEGO was well placed to the half, bid two wide to engage for the lead on the second turn, pushed clear to mid stretch then dug in and just held
on. MAGICAL PATH had no speed, settled to the half, was three then four wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and just missed. OLIVE YOU MORE
was also allowed to settle, raced two wide on the second turn then shifted out for room and was gaining belatedly. HOLY ZAGS trailed to the second turn,
came two wide to the stretch then shifted in and closed steadily along the rail. SCHERZO (GB) raced mid pack to the second turn, was forced out to the five
path to the stretch then also had a mild late bid. SPUN AWAY was outrun to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, bid four wide then was pushed out
to the six path to the stretch and got outfinished in the final furlong. BRAHMS COMMAND was chasing the pace to the second turn, offered her best try
three wide to the stretch but faltered in the drive. ZAGRAH (GB) set the pace to the second turn then was overtaken and tired. LA GATA ELEGANTE
tracked the pace for five furlongs then stopped.

Footnotes
READY FOR A FIGHT had good speed, dueled outside the runnerup and three deep to the stretch, battled determinedly through a long drive and edged
away late. IN OUR A was on the pace inside the winner, raced two wide to the stretch, stayed on gamely to deep stretch then was bested. TORPEDO
AWAY had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch and was gaining ground steadily. SQUARE DEAL stalked the pace early then moved up outside the
top two to duel four wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then was outfinished. MAKAH LANE broke slow and veered inward, was straightened but
had no speed, raced two wide on the turn and improved his position in the drive. PISTON tracked the leaders in the two path to the stretch but weakened in
the final furlong. ABUSIVE GARY was chasing early, raced in check in tight quarters off heels at the half mile pole, came three wide to the stretch but lacked
a closing response. I AM ALLTHATYOUARE got outsprinted to the turn, was fanned out to the four path to the stretch and did not threaten. PAPAPIFAS
had no speed and saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
MY LEGAL BET chased the leaders to the turn, was two wide to the stretch, responded and rallied through a tight hole between rivals in upper stretch,
dueled the runnerup then edged clear in the late stages. THIS IS THE ONE also was chasing outside the winner, raced three wide to the stretch, shifted out
for room, rallied to duel then was outfinished while not threatened for second. DIAMETRIC got outsprinted to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch
and showed some interest late. SHEZARUNAWAY had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch then angled out at the three sixteenths and was closing
ground belatedly. ZAKAR attended the pace two wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then was outkicked and tired. MUNN SHE'S PRETTY had
good speed, dueled inside to the stretch, was overtaken in upper stretch and tired. LIVIN' AT THE BU got outsprinted to the turn, circled five wide to the
stretch but was not a threat in the drive. CLEVER CHIEFTESS hustled to contest the pace outside two others to the stretch then gave way. KATIE'S
PARADISE had no speed, raced two then three wide to the stretch but lacked a late bid. TRISKAIDEKA also had no speed and saved ground to no avail.
PEGGY SLEW was always outrun.
