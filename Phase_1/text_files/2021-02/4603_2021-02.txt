tracked the pace pressing in bid on the far turn being carried out a bit in upper stretch vying to a late lead in the three path only to be grabbed at the wire.

drifting out under left hand urging then in under right hand encouragement in mid stretch finishing with little left. WILLY'S CASTLE pressed on the backside
