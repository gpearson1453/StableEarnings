Footnotes
TRACY FLICK set the pace along the inside, dug in gamely to cling to an advantage inside of a pair of foes through the lane, but came out a bit and bumped
CHAMPAGNE IVY approaching the wire. FOREVER BOSS stalked three wide, bid for the lead outside of a pair of rivals in upper stretch, dueled with those
foes through the lane, but was denied victory by her inner most counterpart. CHAMPAGNE IVY prompted the pace two wide, bid for the lead turning for
home, dueled between horses through the lane, but was bumped by his inner rival approaching the wire, then clipped heels with that foe at the finish. A
THING OF BEAUTY tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, tipped outside of the embattled trio of leaders in midstretch, and produced a
grinding rally to narrow their advantage, but did not have enough to catch them. CHARGES DROPPED stalked along the inside, but chased the leaders
evenly through the lane without producing a bid. THE FLYING PHAROAH bumped the gate at the start and lied well off of the pace along the inside around
the first turn, took the far turn three wide before advancing in upper stretch, got bumped seven wide in midstretch as PICCADILLY LANE forced her way out,
then stayed on thereafter. PERHAPS TONIGHT (IRE) got a bit crowded between horses a few strides out of the gate causing her to be taken in hand,
encountered more restraint into the first turn when between horses, then advanced subtly while shifting inwards into the far turn, and failed to factor
thereafter. PICCADILLY LINE tracked from midpack along the inside, lost position into the far turn, took that bend two wide before attempting to shift out in
upper stretch, bumped THE FLYING PHAROAH multiple times approaching the furlong pole to be six wide, then lacked a rally. BAFFLE 'EM lied off of the
pace three wide around both turns, and failed to factor. MIA AT MIDNIGHT lied far off of the pace in the three path, rallied four wide turning for home, but
flattened out in midstretch, and weakened thereafter. CAUSEWAY PRINCESS lied off of the pace along the inside, and was done early. SOLO UNO trailed
throughout and was outrun. FOLLOWING A STEWARD'S INQUIRY, AS WELL AS A RIDER'S OBJECTION: CHAMPAGNE IVY AGAINST TRACY FLICK
FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, TRACY FLICK WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THIRD

Footnotes
KOBE FIFTY TWO set the pace along the inside feeling stern pressure from MONTE NE, shifted out to engage that foe in upper stretch, dug in on his left
lead, but was headed approaching the sixteenth pole, changed to his right lead passing that marker and sustained the duel, then won the photo via a head
bob. MONTE NE vied two wide, shifted to the three path before being floated to the four path in upper stretch, dueled through the lane as his inner
counterpart dug in, forged an advantage with a sixteenth to go, but hung, and lost via a head bob. SCOTTY BROWN stalked three wide, shifted to the five
path in upper stretch to stay outside of the battling leaders, grinded away outside of those foes through the lane, but missed on the wire. WEEKEND
DREAMER stalked along the inside while under a snug hold into the turn, attempted a rail bid in upper stretch as the leader vacated it, but lacked a kick to
threaten the leaders, and tired in the late stages. NASHTRICK lied off of the pace in the three path around the turn, shifted to the six path in upper stretch,
and offered a mild kick without menacing. HARDREDCANDY was last away, trailed the field in the four path around the turn, swung to the seven path in
upper stretch, and failed to factor. KHOZY MY BOY saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.

Footnotes
BABY LION pressed the pace two wide, took over nearing the three-eighths pole, quickly drew off in hand and widened while drifting out slightly and still in
hand through the lane. BRODY'S HONOR had early speed inside, was shuffled back while racing two wide around the turn, split rivals in upper stretch and
was along for the place. HOLY SECRET tracked the pace three and four wide, never threatened the winner and was along for the show. KERIK raced in
range three wide and lacked a closing bid. DANCING EMPRESS set the pace along the rail and tired after five furlongs. PERSONAL REWARD was outrun
while racing two wide. MELLOW GOLD played no factor while racing three wide. BELLA GABRIELLA was in range inside early, steadied near the
nine-sixteenths pole, angled four wide nearing the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
LONTANO stalked embattled leaders from multiple lengths off around the turn, gained ground while shifting to the eight path turning for home to position
outside of those foes, determinedly pursued MACHO BLUE through upper stretch, bid outside of that leader at the sixteenth pole, and edged an advantage
late. MACHO BLUE was sent from the gates to vie inside of HENRY'S WORLD early on, allowed that foe to clear into the turn, pressed that rival from the
outside through a fast pace around the bend, got floated out turning for home by that foe, forged an advantage while shifting all the way to the seven path
entering the lane as LONTANO ranged up in pursuit, held a margin from that foe into the final furlong, but was bested inside the final sixteenth. STATION
ROCK trailed the field along the inside into the turn, saved ground around the bend, then improved the position along the rail through the lane without
threatening the top two. HENRY'S WORLD was sent from the gate to set the pace, cleared MACHO BLUE into the turn while establishing a fast pace,
drifted outwards turning for home as that foe produced an outside re-bid, but was headed in upper stretch, weakened through the lane under left handed
correction from the rider, and lost show late. BODIE CODY lied far off of the pace two wide, came into the lane in the four path, and failed to factor. TALE
OF KANTHAROS lied off of the pace in the two path around the turn, and failed to make an impact before fading.

Footnotes
BOLD AGENDA prompted the pace three wide between foes, took over leaving the quarter pole, steadily drifted out through the lane and held firm under a
drive. GHOSTLORE tracked the pace from an open rail, rallied inside through the lane but could not quite reel in the winner. NO MORE BUSINESS saved
ground off the pace, stayed along the rail through the lane and was along for the show. GROWL TIGER set a rated pace in the two path and gave way
readily turning for home. DERBY DATE was in range four wide and came up empty in the lane. BAY STREET MONEY hit the starting gate, raced off the
pace two wide and never threatened. WINTER POOL was off slow, raced three wide and was outrun.

ASTRAY lied off of the pace along the inside, shifted four wide turning for home, produced a bid outside of rivals in midstretch, but was outkicked by an
inner surging foe passing the furlong pole, and chased him home. CAPITAN FOFO gained outside of foes to prompt the pace two wide into the turn, vied
around the bend before leading at the quarter pole, but was headed by outer foes passing the furlong marker, and yielded. RACK GIN was off slowly and
trailed the field early on, gained to a three wide stalking position into the turn, but tired between horses passing the furlong pole, and bled. YES FOR LESS
failed to factor. DEO FORTE set the pace along the inside, but was headed by rivals at the quarter pole, and weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
COME STORMING raced off the pace two wide, bumped with MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT nearing the far turn, advanced three wide around that bend, swung
widest turning for home, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. ROSA STAR stalked the pace two wide, took the
lead nearing the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, led to sixteenth pole, drifted out a bit and gave way grudgingly inside of the winner. PARDON MY
HEART was bumped between foes at the start, raced well back two wide, advanced five wide around the far turn and rallied for the show. TWILIGHT saved
ground in midpack, made progress inside nearing the lane but flattened out a bit in the final furlong. MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT saved ground off the pace,
bumped with the winner nearing the far turn, continued to save ground around that bend, angled out in upper stretch and improved position.
KELLEYCANRUN was bumped at the start, settled off the early pace three wide, made a strong four wide run into contention rounding the far turn, battled
between to midstretch, lacked room from there and was not urged through the final furlong. SYLVANELLA tracked the pace two wide, bid three wide nearing
the quarter pole and came up empty in the lane. I'LL DO IT MY WAY was bumped at the start, raced three and four wide and never threatened. ALOHA
KITTEN chased the pace two wide, dropped back rapidly around the far turn and lacked any further bids. MISS WROTE set a clear pace along the rail and
retreated through the lane. ORIGINAL TIMES REINSTATED UPON REVIEW; RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
TWIRLING FAITH bobbled outwards at the start causing SHADILEE to be pinched back, stalked along the inside before shifting two wide into the turn to
engage the leader from the outside, assumed command from that foe approaching the quarter pole, drew off under mild urging through upper stretch, but
hung on her left lead through the final furlong, tired in the late stages, but held safely to the wire. SHADILEE was pinched back at the start, saved ground
around the turn while far off of the pace, commenced a rally turning for home, tipped two wide in midstretch to surpass the early pace setter, and pursued
the tiring leader through the final furlong while narrowing her margin, but ran out of ground. KATZ A DREAM tracked from midpack four wide, advanced to a
three wide stalking position into the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, got outkicked by an inner rallying rival in midstretch, and
stayed on to achieve show late. CAPTURE THE GENIE set the pace along the inside, but was headed by TWIRLING FAITH at the five sixteenths pole,
proved no match for that foe turning for home, then weakened through the lane. SUPER CAT LADY got crowded between horses at the start, lied far off of
the pace in the four path around the turn, and failed to factor. SMACK stalked two wide, but weakened at the three furlong pole, then was eased through the
lane.

Footnotes
KILKEA set the pace along the rail, was briefly headed near the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, angled out a bit late to meet the bid of
ENJOYITWHILEWECAN and dug in tenaciously to prevail. ENJOYITWHILEWECAN tracked the early pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far
turn, steadily gained through the lane, reached even terms in deep stretch but could not get by the winner. LINNY KATE stalked the pace from the rail,
remained up close two wide around the far turn, tipped further out in upper stretch and had a mild gain for the show. LAKE LUCERNE raced well back two
and three wide, swung widest in upper stretch and finished strongly. BEAN COUNTER raced two and three wide in midpack, angled six wide in upper
stretch and had a mild gain. OSAKA GIRL prompted the winner two wide, put a head in front near the quarter pole but weakened in the lane. NOPE (IRE)
saved ground to no avail. SETTING THE MOOD was bumped at the start, saved ground well back and rallied belatedly inside. DIAMOND SPARKLES was
bumped at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. MIMINA'S TEAM failed to menace while racing three and four wide. PASSIVE INVESTING
played no factor while racing two wide. ELLA BRILLA was bumped between foes at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ALWAYZ LATE tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted out around the far turn to produce a four to five wide sweep past the leaders turning for
home, led between horses in midstretch, and held sway thereafter. CADENCIA lied off of the pace two wide, commenced an advance along the inside
around the far turn before rallying four to six wide turning for home, ranged up to ALWAYZ LATE in midstretch, but failed to reach even terms with that rival.
VICTORIAN GOLD (IRE) tracked from midpack two wide, gained ground three to four wide turning for home inside of ALWAYZ LATE, but got outkicked by
that foe in midstretch. GREAT WARRIOR (IRE) stalked along the inside, but was outmoved by outer foes turning for home, and chased them through the
lane before just holding fourth from a pair of outer foes. NEVER CONTENT (IRE) stalked along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, but got held up
behind traffic turning for home causing him to be outmoved by outer foes, did not find clear racing room until shifting five wide deep in the final furlong, and
stayed on to just miss a minor share. MARIA'S REVENGE got brushed at the start, lied far off of the pace along the inside shifted four wide in upper stretch,
and stayed on to just miss a minor share while failing to menace. DANCE WITH DESTINY cleared into the first turn, vied inside of SECRETS TOLD down
the backstretch, then weakened in upper stretch. SECRETS TOLD stalked two wide into the first turn, pulled forward around that bend to vie for the lead into
the backstretch, then weakened between horses turning for home. NOT SHY and KILLARIO were outrun. CARELESS HEIRESS bobbled one stride out of
the gate, lied forwardly placed four to three wide around the first turn, then weakened turning for home.
