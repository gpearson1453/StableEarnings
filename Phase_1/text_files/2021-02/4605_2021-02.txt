SOUL FIGHT was rated in good position while out from the inside, edged out entering the far turn, vied three wide after six furlongs, dueled through the lane
and prevailed. GOOGLE IT stalked in hand two wide outside the early leader, took over entering the far turn, dueled inside the winner through the lane but
was outfinished. LONG TOM made a run three wide around the final turn then flattened out. POSITIVE IMPACT broke slowly, raced well out from the inside
around the final turn and failed to matter. KINZEA STONE was hustled to the front at once, stayed along the rail while in control into the far turn, stopped
and was eased up through the lane. TRIBULATION was finished after a half then was eased up.

SWEET MAGIC MOMENT took command at once, stayed just out from the rail, ran out a bit when displaced entering the stretch, regained command
leaving the furlong grounds and held under urging. AUDREY GRACE stayed out from the rail while chasing, was carried out while moving to a short lead
into the stretch then gave way. QUEEN STINKER settled, rallied into tight quarters behind the top two nearing the stretch, angled to the outside for room but
lacked the needed closing. RAISETONEW HEIGHTS raced two wide around the final turn and lacked a rally. SHINE LIKE BOBBY trailed.
