Footnotes
BACI tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing through the backstretch, made a steady advance three wide on the turn to wrest command nearing
upper stretch, then steadily extended the margin under firm encouragement. REGGAE REVOLUTION, bumped by STORMY MUSIC at the start, recovered
quickly while angling inside to be rated just off the first flight racing into the turn, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady effort
to edge a rival for the place honors in time. ANDREA'S WORRY, urged prompting a rival's pace through the backstretch into the turn, weakened between
foes leaving midstretch. TEA PARTY shifted off the rail in the opening stages while being urged to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage through the
backstretch, dueled inside foes on the turn and gave way nearing midstretch. STORMY MUSIC broke awkwardly bumping REGGAE REVOLUTION, angled
nearest to the inside while dropping out last racing to the turn and offered no rally.

Footnotes
FIRST HOMESTEAD, urged between foes dictating the pace on a narrow margin, shook clear nearing upper stretch and was kept to firm encouragement to
maintain a safe margin to the end. WICKED STRONG ALEX, forwardly placed four wide, then three wide between foes tracking just off the pacesetter,
continued with a steady bid pursuing the leader into the stretch but was always only second best. COUSIN tracked the leader between foes in the opening
stages, conceded some position entering the turn, was urged to advance between foes nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick while shifting
to the inside late. HE HAD A SECRET shifted out five wide in early stages tracking just off the second flight, was prompted to make brief progress four wide
on the turn but faded in the drive. YEUDIEL settled near the inside in early stages and failed to menace thereafter. PELUCHIN CHIN, urged inside foes
prompting the pacesetter into the turn, gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
SHARON'S LAW, urged to the lead shifting well off rail racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage in the three path through the
backstretch, forged clear racing through the far turn while remaining well off the inside, extended the margin under right handed pressure, then despite the
loss of her rider's whip in the final strides. MERICATHEBEAUTIFUL, slow to gather stride, angled inwards racing to the backstretch to split rivals just off the
inside, was prompted to advance inside foes nearing upper stretch and proved best of the others. TENERIFE MOON tracked off the second flight racing to
the backstretch, switched out on the far turn, was fanned to the five path entering the stretch and continued to improve position. LADY MIDAS, bumped at
the start settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch, angled three wide nearing the lane and passed between tiring foes. INDY PRINCESS KOKO
broke out bumping LADY MIDAS at the start while stumbling slightly, was prompted to regain contention while switching out four wide on the backstretch,
was urged to lodge a brief bid outside the pacesetter entering the far turn but quickly flattened out. UNITEDTORUN settled outside foes in the last flight
racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. STARSHIP PRANKSTER angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders along the rail into the
backstretch and steadily faded after a half. MISS BOOMER BABE angled inwards to prompt the pacesetter racing to the backstretch and gave way between
foes entering the far turn.

Footnotes
HAIL SOUTHERN broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the rail through the backstretch, extended that margin on the turn,
then shifted inwards nearing midstretch to hold the challenge of POWERFUL MOON to the end under firm handling. The latter broke readily, prompted the
pacesetter racing to the turn, conceded some position entering the bend, then was roused to advance entering upper stretch while shifting inside the leader
but proved only second best. ALMONASTER tracked the leaders in second flight while racing four deep between foes in the opening stages, then continued
in that path to upper stretch finishing evenly for a share. STRIKING MIKE was rated between foes just off the second flight racing into the turn, shifted about
under pressure through the stretch but had no closing bid. NOT INVENTED HERE tracked just off the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight racing
into the turn and steadily faded entering the stretch. CAPTAIN LIO, a bit outpaced while angling to the inside, shifted three wide in the closing stages but
offered no rally. UPRISE came under pressure in early stages tracking the leaders five wide in second flight racing to the turn and gave way abruptly
entering the bend.

Footnotes
NOTORIOUS R B G, in touch with the pacesetter between foes attending the pace in the opening stages, conceded some position while angling to the
inside entering the turn, switched outside the leader in upper stretch and continued with a steady bid racing through the stretch to wrest a narrow advantage
in time under firm right handed encouragement. SILVER TUNES broke sharply, angled to the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing into
the turn, then grudgingly resisted the winner to the end to just miss. PUGILIST, reserved off the second flight along the inside racing through the
backstretch, steadily gained position between foes nearing upper stretch, steadied momentarily avoiding tight quarters entering the lane but split foes in the
three path in the closing stages continuing willingly to close the gap on the top pair. FRERET angled to the inside in early stages pursuing the leaders as
part of the second flight, then continued evenly inside foes through the lane. BEACH BAR tracked the leaders between rivals in second flight, shifted out to
the five path in upper stretch and faded in late stages. TWIRLING STAR broke slowly, raced five wide into the turn and proved no threat.
BETTERTHENYOURX tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing into the turn and dropped back early. KATIE SCARLETT joined the pace three
wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards racing into the turn to briefly press the issue outside the pacesetter but emptied out abruptly entering the stretch.

QUALITY STEP was rated outside foes from well out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced on the leaders four deep nearing the
second bend, shifted inwards nearing upper stretch while moving to gain a clear advantage, then held the challenge of MORNING STRIDE to the end under
firm handling. The latter angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the first turn, switched out after a half to advance three wide between
foes to bid in tandem with the eventual winner, couldn't match that rival nearing the lane but switched out entering the stretch to finish willingly closing the
gap late. DOVER CLIFFS tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, was urged to bid for command between rivals
entering the far turn, couldn't match the top pair racing into upper stretch and faded late while lasting for a share. KITTEN'S SPA, reserved between foes in
the last flight early, switched out entering the far turn and continued with a steady effort to improve his position four wide in the lane. SHENDAM (FR), urged
to a forward placing along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, was eased back from that position after a half, switched out on the far turn to race
between foes but had no closing bid. BLACKLINE settled between foes racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside after a half, briefly awaited an opening
while switching outside foes on the far turn, then was fanned five wide in the stretch and lacked a further response. KRAMDEN was a brief factor between
foes tracking behind the second flight but faded early. BATTLE CREEK, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, offered no rally. SKIPPY'S STRIKE
was urged to the lead along the inside to dictate the pace on a narrow margin but gave way after a half. THE BOSS FACTOR, forwardly placed three wide
racing to the backstretch, shifted in to gain the advantage racing into the far turn but gave way abruptly nearing upper stretch. UNCLE DREW dropped out
early.

Footnotes
LAKOTA PRINCESS broke readily to gain terms with a rival attending the pace through the backstretch, pressed the issue into upper stretch, edged forward
leaving midstretch and held SHALL RETURN to the end under firm left handed pressure. The latter was caught five wide early tracking the leaders from just
out of striking distance, was prompted to advance four wide on the turn to upper stretch to challenge for command late but was outkicked. BONITA ANNIE
tracked just off the first flight inside foes racing into the bend, shifted out to bid three deep between foes nearing upper stretch but proved no match for the
top pair while edging a rival for a share. FOGGY FLIGHT, urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, dueled into
upper stretch and faded late. FIELD LETTERS settled off the second flight racing five wide to the turn and continued in that path to pass tiring rivals.
LIGHTS DOWN LOW settled along the inside early and proved no threat. FIFTYSHADESOGRAYCE, bumped at the start, was righted to make brief pursuit
of the leaders four wide into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. SOLD ON SALSA broke out bumping a rival at the start, was righted to briefly pursue
the leaders three deep between foes to the turn but quickly came up empty.

Footnotes
BELLA PIERINA broke readily to gain a clear advantage while angling to the rail racing through the chute, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin to the
far turn, held sway past midstretch and was kept to firm right handed encouragement to maintain a safe advantage to the end. BLOODY MARY MORNIN
shifted inwards racing through the chute making some contact with SKOL CHANT, tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight to the far turn, was
prompted to make a steady advance on the leader through the stretch but proved only second best. UNABRIDGED (IRE) was rated off the second flight
between foes racing to the backstretch, split rivals three wide racing into the lane, then shifted five wide in the closing stages but continued with interest to
edge rivals for a share. MAGIC HATTER switched outside foes to track off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing four
wide on the far turn to upper stretch but had no final kick. WONDER BLONDY, off slowly, raced wide to the backstretch steadily regaining position, was
fanned five wide into upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position. CARIBBEAN KITTEN settled outside foes in the last flight racing to
the backstretch, was fanned six wide into upper stretch and made some belated progress. COLONELS DAUGHTER, reserved along the inside as part of
the last flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch while being urged to gain some position but made no real impact. EYE ON THE
FINISH angled inwards to gain a forward placing while caught in tight quarters between foes racing to the first turn, continued as part of the second flight to
the far turn and steadily faded in late stages. POSTINO'S IDOL was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch but offered no rally. SKOL
CHANT, jostled between foes racing through the chute, was urged to gain a forward placing entering the first turn tracking the pacesetter to the second
bend, then steadily faded between foes into the stretch. LUCY'S TOWN settled between foes in the last flight and never gained contention. CLASSY OF
COURSE, caught in tight quarters and steadied along the inside leaving the chute, switched out to track between foes off the second flight racing to the
backstretch but faded early.

DOWNTOWNER, unhurried between foes racing three wide to the backstretch, shifted four wide nearing the far turn while being prompted to advance,
moved to challenge in that path racing into upper stretch, then took over and went clear late under some right handed pressure. CENTRAL PARK broke
outwards bumping HE'S SMOKIN NOW forcing him into the path of BABY I'M PERFECT while gaining the advantage between calls racing into the first turn,
was taken in hand conceding the lead nearing the backstretch to track just outside the first flight, moved to challenge for command three wide on the far turn
to gain the advantage between calls in upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. GENERAL PADDY, bumped at the start, angled
sharply to the inside early to track just off the leaders to the far turn, shifted out entering upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share.
OLYMPIC ROMP, prompted to a forward placing along the rail, pressed the issue inside the leader leaving the midway point of the far turn to bid for
command inside foes but weakened in the drive. BABY I'M PERFECT, bumped at the start, then forced into GENERAL PADDY, was collected, then urged
to gain the lead outside rivals racing through the first turn, dictated the pace a bit off the rail racing to the far turn and gave way between foes into upper
stretch. TUDOX EXPECTATIONS settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was caught five wide after a half but offered no rally. HE'S
SMOKIN NOW, bumped soundly, then forced into BABY I'M PERFECT at the start, was settled between foes racing four wide to the backstretch and proved
no threat.

Footnotes
SATURDAY SUN came through close quarters racing through the chute to be rated three wide as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled
inwards entering the far turn advancing on the leaders, switched outside the pacesetter in upper stretch and wrested the advantage to go clear under firm
handling. TAKE TO THE SKIES, urged to the lead along the inside, dueled for command inside rivals to the second bend, regained the advantage racing
into upper stretch, briefly resisted the winner but proved only second best. SHEDANCESFORFATE settled last to the backstretch, switched outside foes
racing into the far turn, advanced four wide to upper stretch and continued well enough to earn a share. DANCE RECITAL settled between foes in the last
flight to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. BELLA JENSHEA settled outside foes racing to the
backstretch, shifted inwards racing into the far turn to split rivals just off the inside entering the lane but had no final kick. KAHIKO, reserved along the inside
racing to the backstretch, offered no rally. FIRST IN COMMAND, caught in tight quarters racing through the chute, pulled her way between foes to track off
the leaders in second flight to the backstretch but faded early. FAIRY DIVA (GB) was rated along the inside just off the first flight, steadily faded racing into
the far turn. ECLECTIC SOUL, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, gave way between foes nearing upper stretch.
