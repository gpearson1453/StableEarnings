Footnotes
BENCH JUDGE in range early outside a rival, went between foes at the seven-sixteenths, chased outside another rival around the turn and into the stretch,
bid three deep late, bumped with inner rival and dug in to get up. EXULTATION showed early speed then chased the leader from inside, saved ground
around the bend, tipped out and brushed rival in the stretch, bid between late and bumped with rivals on both sides and missed. HARTEL set the pace early
while clear, angled to the inside, remained unchallenged to mid-stretch, pressured in the final sixteenth, bumped with the runner-up and got caught in the
closing moments. SIGALERT raced inside rivals then checked past the half-mile pole, raced a bit off the rail into the turn, angled three wide leaving the bend
and finished willingly to earn a minor award. GALLOPING MISCHIEF stalked off the inside, raced three wide then angled in on the turn, then lacked a rally
in the stretch. SHUSTER was in tight and steadied soon after the start, saved ground around the turn, angled out and passed tired rivals. SHOW
BUSINESS was in tight between horses and got squeezed early, tracked off the rail then angled in and saved ground through the turn, angled out in upper
stretch
and
offered
no
response.
SQUALOTORO

Footnotes
GABBY HAYES showed early speed and pressed the leader from outside, moved up to duel with that rival and took over nearing the half-mile pole, put
away inner rival at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command to FUNKENTSTEIN past the quarter pole, fought back along the inside through the stretch and
dug in late to win the bob on the line. FUNKENSTEIN came away to an awkward beginning, stalked outside a rival then between foes, ranged up outside
the leader on the far turn and gained control past the quarter pole, held a short lead over the GABBY HAYES through the length of the stretch and got
outnodded at the wire. SIR WILLIAMS DREAM tracked the top pair from inside, came off the rail on the second bend and gained the show. STONE'S
RIVER stumbled leaving the gate but still came away quickest, sped to the front with company to the outside, dueled with GABBY HAYES up the
backstretch to the three-eighths, lost contact midway through the turn and faded. BIG FRANK DA TANK angled in soon after the start, steered outside a pair
of rivals on the first turn, went three deep up the backstretch, entered the stretch three wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
SWEETEST ANGEL pulled early on the first turn and settled into strides exiting that bend, stalked along the fence to the far turn, asked at the
five-sixteenths, checked off the heels of the leader at the quarter pole, shifted two wide and bumped rival entering the stretch, cleared at the three-sixteenths
pole and drew away under some left-handed urging and strong handling late. CIDER APPLE (GB) stalked outside the leader, lost ground around the far
turn, bumped by inner rival while three wide into the stretch and held the place. JIBBER JABBER (IRE) tucked inside early, saved ground to the stretch,
angled out and got up for the show. HYLAND HAVEN traveled two wide to the stretch, tipped out and got edged for the show between rivals. SHVERE
ARBETER sprinted to the front and moved inside, inched away around the far turn, caught in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
MOTOWN MUSIC stalked inside then moved into the two path on the far turn, angled three wide around that bend, steered back inside in upper stretch,
rallied up the fence and nailed RONAMO at the wire. RONAMO angled into the two path entering the first turn, traveled outside a rival then went outside
foes on the backstretch, came four wide into the stretch, rallied and led with a sixteenth to go but got nailed by the winner. DR. TROUTMAN set the pace
early, showed the way clear to the eighth pole, lost command mid-stretch, could not match the top pair late and finished a clear third. SINGLE ME OUT
stumbled badly at the start, tucked inside on the first turn, tipped out into the stretch and improved position. ZIMBA WARRIOR chased between foes then
steadied off heels on the first turn, dropped back entering the second bend, angled four wide and never threatened. EL DIABLO ROJO stalked off the rail,
took aim three wide into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. ALCOOLS was closest in pursuit early from the two path, started to weaken entering
the stretch and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
CAPO MAFIOSO set the pace with CHIPPER to the outside, cleared that rival at the top of the stretch, led through the lane under a drive and held in the
closing moments. CHIPPER pressed the pace from outside, chased two wide into the stretch, urged right-handed in the lane, came back on late and kept
gaining to the wire. OX BRIDGE broke in, chased the speed from inside, tipped out in the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. UNCLE RAY bothered at
the start, tracked the leader in the two path or between rivals, continued two wide into the lane and lacked the necessary bid. MONGOLIAN FORD raced off
the pace while off the rail, went three wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and never rallied. UNION BLISS bothered by OX BRIDGE at the
start, raced off the pace from inside and could not offer the needed response when called upon. SQUEAKY CHEEKY chased three wide through the turn,
weakened in the lane, injured past the wire and was vanned off.

NOTRE DAME bumped leaving the gate, dueled for the lead from outside, cleared rival at the top of the stretch and drew off. BETITO chased along the
inside then moved into the two path, entered the lane three wide and held the place. LUCKY RYAN SEVEN settled off the pace, took the turn four to five
wide and kept on for the show honors. JUNGLE BOY chased two wide through the turn, gained a minor share but never threatened. STIR THE POT
bumped leaving the gate, dueled for the lead from inside to the stretch and gave way. GUINESSEY chased outside rivals up the backstretch, went five wide
into the turn, exited four wide and offered no response. COUNT ALEXEI well placed behind the top pair early, saved ground while losing momentum on the
turn and weakened. ARRIVEDERCI ROMA tracked off the rail, entered the stretch three wide and weakened. BEST DANCE lacked early speed, raced wide
through the turn and made no impact. SYNSKY shuffled back between rivals at the start, raced off the rail, went three wide into the turn, five wide into the

headed DESMOND DOSS at the quarter pole, dueled with that rival through the length of the stretch and edged rival in the closing moments. DESMOND
DOSS tossed his head and came away a bit slow but recovered quickly and was sent inside, bumped MARGOT'S BOY into the first turn, set the pace inside
rivals, headed by FASHIONABLY FAST at the quarter pole, dueled through the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. BRANDOTHEBARTENDER stalked
the top quartet in the two path, angled out and came three to four wide into the stretch, bid from outside the top pair in the lane and lacked the needed late
kick. MARGOT'S BOY got bumped by inside rival entering the first turn, pressed the pace between rivals then dropped back to stalk near the halfway point,
traveled two wide into the far turn, angled four to five wide leaving the turn and weakened. SURFING STAR raced three deep around the first turn, raced up
close between rivals, chased two wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MALIBU HANNAH tracked two wide then angled four wide leaving the second turn, move out further at the top of the drive, rallied and proved best late.
GOLDEN JOURNEY had early speed inside of FLAG SALUTE then let that rival take command, stalked up the backstretch then took aim two wide into the
drive, grabbed the lead just inside of the eighth pole but got outkicked by the winner. JAXONS TOUR GUIDE settled early along the inside, shifted three
wide entering the stretch and gained the show. KIND BUT SHE LIES stalked two wide then outside a rival, entered the stretch three wide then moved out a
bit further at the top of the lane and finished evenly. JUDY WITH GRACE fractious in the gate, bobbled at the start, went between rivals around the first turn,
raced outside a rival on the backstretch, took the second turn three wide, angled out in the stretch and needed to find more in the final sixteenth. FLAG
SALUTE showed early speed and contested the pace outside a rival then cleared into the backstretch, set all the pace to the lane, pressured in upper
stretch, clung to a short lead at the eighth pole then weakened in the furlong grounds. ESJA tucked inside early, saved ground into the lane and was never a
factor. AVISSE stumbled badly leaving the gate, went three wide around the first turn, raced outside a rival and two wide into the stretch and made no
impact.
