Footnotes
WHICHWAYTOMALIBU coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four then three
wide straightened away into upper stretch, rallied to take command just outside the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive kept to task. A VOW OF BEAUTY
led early on before settling four then three wide in aim of the leader, advanced to take over five-sixteenths from home, got let out spinning three then two
wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, ran on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. RETICENT chased along the
inside from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to
secure the show honors. RINGGOOD coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home,
offered up a mild bid, then flattened out in the late stages. MIGHTY WIND a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, ranged up after the break to take
command six and a half furlongs from home, showed the way in hand along the inside shaking away when pulling on the bit rating unkindly and was taken
under a bit firmer hold five furlongs out to throttle down the pace, had the field take closer order and was given a notch midway on the turn coming under
pressure from A VOW OF BEAUTY to the outside, came under coaxing headed for command at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and
tired. DEVILISH MOOD coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, angled out four wide into upper stretch and
tired. TALESPIN brushed the off side stall at the start when breaking out a step, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five to six
wide into upper stretch and tired. RATCHET lunged at the start getting away last, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch before darting to the
two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. STARSHIP EMPIRE five paths
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
never menaced.

Footnotes
CAUSE OF ACTION loped along the inside route on the backstreth, closed the gap a bit during the run around the bend, got cued up for the drive, was
worked into path four from upper to midstretch, kicked in and gained ground on the ones to catch, proved relentless to the end, stealing away the verdict
right at the finish line. HONORABLE SERVICE tracked the pace from the rail, cut the corner into the lane, gained optimal clearance in midstretch after FOX
RED drifted into path two in the vicinity of the eighth pole, forged to a slim lead in deep stretch only to get nailed by the top one in the last jump. FOX RED
broke in line with RYAN'S CAT, remained engaged in a fight for the top with that opponent for the opening half, participating in it from the inside, got turned
loose for the drive home, drifted towards path two in midlane, inadvertently providing some running run for second place finisher, relinquished reluctantly
with under a sixteenth to go, weakened into the show slot. BATTERBATTERSWING well rated while well spotted three wide in range of a contested pace,
went into the stretch, put in its best bid during the ensuing furlong then flattened out. RYAN'S CAT sparred for command towards path two until the top of
the lane, gave way. CAVARADOSSI pursued the pace two wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one wider, lacked the necessary response. WINNING
DRIVE chased the pace two to three wide, swung five wide on empty into the stretch and steadily backed away.

VALLARAND broke out at the start and was corrected, chased three then two wide, took the inside route into upper stretch before tipping to the two path
roused straightened away into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command a sixteenth out, then dug in to prevail
safely on the wire. DESTINATIONWNRSCIR four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, ran
on through to the finish and was up for the place honors in the final jumps. IRRESISTIBLE GIRL four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths and advanced on the front through the latter portion of the turn, swung three to four wide into upper stretch taking over command straightened
away, dug in under threat drifting out just inside the eighth pole, got collared a sixteenth from home and kept on to preserve the show honors well clear of
the rest. EPONA'S DREAM lunged to the off side at the start brushing the gate and getting away last, chased along the inside detached at the tail of the
field, tipped to the two path through the turn placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position by tired
foes. ESOTICA chased inside early on in closest aim of the leader before advancing to take command at the nine-sixteenths, showed the way through the
turn under pressure coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and yielded the front straightened away, then
tired in the drive. JILL'S A HOT MESS showed the way early on three then two wide before being headed for command at the nine-sixteenths, prompted the
aforementioned foe through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MOSIENKO away without apparent mishap, tipped into the three path in time for the start of the run around the bend, vied for control as the widest of three,
had already necked the second place finisher when switched over to stronger handling in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, edged clear then
dug in well enough to hold sway. APPLETINI grabbed away the advantage from a well-held HAPPY SOPHIA early on the backstretch, led for a good portion
of the journey on the backstretch left attended, faced pressure from a pair of opponents to her outside once on the turn, was the first of that threesome to
have its pilot commit to a drive, this occurring right around the five-sixteenths pole, released the advantage for good a furlong later, stayed on to salvage
second. HAPPY SOPHIA spotted into path two, was between rivals disputing the pace from the top of the bend until its end, stepped into lane having been
roused starting from the midway point on the turn, wasn't displaying momentum maneuvering into path three in midstretch, gained some ground late, all
done without making headway. GENTLE ANNIE sent onto the rail at the half mile pole, got worked into path four from upper to midstretch, wound up trailing
throughout.

Footnotes
ROSEY'S PEACH cut over to the rail in short order, kept watch on the front runners while loosely pocketed, was let out a notch springing from the midway
point on the turn, got set down a sixteenth later, flashed interest as the half was being reeled off, angled sharply into the path three at the three-sixteenth
pole, maintained the momentum and charged to the front, extended the margin to a healthy one before getting taken in hand for the last forty yards.
FORTUNE'S SISTER shifted to the inside, was in fourth in line along that route, cut the corner into the lane, proved no match rallying for the place. BLEY
argued for the command from along the inside, matched up with CAPTIVATING CARA, was put to a drive just shy of the quarter pole, was overhauled
traversing through the furlong grounds, weakened steadily into the show slot. CAPTIVATING CARA pressed the issue from the two path for the opening half
and gave way. VIVE LA LIBERTY took up position in midpack, was hung out four wide on the turn, tipped towards path five for the drive, made no headway.
PAPI'S BABY GIRL underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, was maneuvered tour wide for the drive home, had no punch. TREMAYNE pulled off BLEY
right after the start, dove onto the inside route, took it until the end of the bend, got moved into path two at the top of the stretch, gave out. EILISH two wide
entering the turn, went four wide exiting it, never got involved. WINTER WARRIOR mostly three wide throughout, folded.

DOCTOR K established the front and spurted away from the two path, tucked inside half a mile from home, continued to widen away from the rest of the
field through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch, got roused straightened away, went clear under a drive and was geared down in the late
stages, the outcome in no doubt. WRITER'S REGRET hustled from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the
inside route into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while offering up a mild bid to secure the place honors. TAINO chased four then three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. CHARLIE FIVE O coaxed from the start, chased three
wide under a ride from midway on the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. CONFORMIST chased two to three wide down the backstretch and
then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, went five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
NICKY THE VEST sparred for command from path two, poked a head down in front coming up to the five-sixteenths pole, extended the margin afterwards
being lightly hand urged, kicked into his best when called upon at the three-sixteenths pole, had already drawn well clear when geared down for the last
seventy yards. LOBSTA disputed the pace to the inside of the winner, got displaced in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, failed to re-claim the top when
put to a drive right afterwards, haplessly watched NICKY THE VEST assert himself down the lane, stayed on for the place. PERFECT MUNNINGS took up
the chase from path two, in between rivals for a good portion of the journey leading up to the five-sixteenths pole, swung out four entering the stretch,
ventured onward to get up for the show. DANCING BUCK rode the rail, got roused at the five-sixteenths marker, went three wide turning into the lane, lost
out third. HORN OF PLENTY keen during the early going, shifted to be outside the others early on the backstretch, departed it from path four, commenced
the stretch one path wider, made no impact. UNO took up the chase primarily from the three path, was under urging prior to reaching the end of the bend,
angled into path four for the drive, lacked the needed response. RE CREATED off the inside, stepped onto the turn from the three path, failed to pick it up
when put to a hand ride from the top of the turn to the three-eighths pole, came into the lane and was allowed to fade away under a protective hold.
