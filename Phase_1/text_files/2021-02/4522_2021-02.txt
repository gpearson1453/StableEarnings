Footnotes
B DUBYA slow early lost ground to upper stretch firing outside of rivals in the seven path sweeping clear late. SUPER VISION pressed the pace dueling to
upper stretch angling out in mid stretch hanging on for place. WHAT'S ON TAP pressed the pace dueling on the inside to upper stretch ceding late in the
two path. CONDUCIVE pressed on the backside then through the far turn extending from the rail down the stretch hanging late. CHEAP SHOT gave a
prompted middle move pressing through the far turn, was weakening when losing path in mid stretch. FLIGHT MISSION slow early played no factor. OPEN
OUT failed to respond. BURKIE was always outrun easing through the lane. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF CHEAP SHOT AGAINST THE RIDER
OF SUPER VISION FOR INTERFERENCE DURING THE STRETCH RUN WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
