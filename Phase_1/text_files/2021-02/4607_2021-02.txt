Footnotes
EXCHEQUER, urged to a position tracking just outside the pacesetter after a breaking a step behind that rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
challenge nearing the quarter mile and edged forward to a clear advantage in late stages under firm right handed encouragement. LITTLE MAZZY settled
last racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn gathering momentum, shifted out three wide to gain between foes racing through the stretch
and edged a rival for the place honors on the wire. MY COWBOY, urged to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the
far turn, resisted the winner's bid to midstretch but yielded late. GRAY BEAU tracked off the second flight inside a rival in the opening half, angled out racing
through the far turn and continued evenly four wide into the lane. AMERICA'S SIMMARD tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the
backstrectch and faded after a half. CAMPAIGN SPY tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was urged to advance on the
leaders racing into the far turn but had no closing bid.

Footnotes
ASTRONAUT OSCAR broke readily to attend a rival's pace under light rating to the turn, pressed the issue nearing upper stretch while being fanned three
wide into the lane, then wrested the advantage and went clear under right handed pressure to prove best. ELGAR was rated between foes as part of the
second flight racing into the bend, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prove best of the others. MR. ANKENY,
urged to the lead racing a bit the off rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the turn, dueled between foes into upper stretch but proved no match late.
SPEEDING KID angled to the inside early tracking just off the pacesetter, was urged to advance along the rail when presented an opening racing into upper
stretch but flattened out leaving the furlong marker. CAROUSE was settled well back in early stages angling to the inside, lacked response when roused
nearing the turn, passed inside a tiring rival racing into the stretch and was vanned off after the race when failing to return to be unsaddled. BETTING ON
RED tracked off the first flight three wide racing to the turn and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
CROWN OF JOY, angled inwards in early stages to track off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out to advance in the five path between foes
racing through upper stretch and wore down rivals in time to prevail under firm handling. SUNDRENCHED, squeezed between foes in the opening stages,
was urged clear racing into the first turn, dictated the pace along the inside to the far turn, was headed racing into upper stretch but continued gamely inside
foes to the end to just miss. BAHAMA KITTEN tracked off the second flight three wide racing to the backstretch, advanced in that path to press the issue
racing through the far turn, gained a brief advantage in upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum. SAPPHIRE JUBILEE settled near the inside
racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes on the far turn, was fanned six wide in upper stretch but continued with an effort to improve position. BABIE
MONSTER, caught in close quarters nearest the rail racing to the first turn, tracked the pacesetter along the inside as part of the second flight, shifted out
while being urged to advance in upper stretch but had no closing bid. QUIET NO MORE settled last to the backstretch and proved no threat. PAYNTER
FEST shifted out squeezing SUNDRENCHED between foes in the opening stages, was switched outside that foe to track just off that rival on the
backstretch, was prompted to bid between foes racing into the far turn but quickly came up empty nearing the lane. WEST HORIZEN, caught four wide
racing into the first turn, tracked the leaders outside foes just off the second flight but steadily faded racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
COOL O TOOLE, reserved along the inside behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted to the two path while being prompted to advance
between foes nearing upper stretch, split rivals just off the inside racing into upper stretch to bid for command three deep between foes leaving the furlong
marker and narrowly prevailed in time under steady handling. WAR EMPRESS angled to the inside leaving the chute tracking off the first flight to the
backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, came around a tiring foe to bid inside the eventual winner leaving midstretch but was outkicked. GOLDEN
OLDIE tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, steadily gained terms with the leaders three wide racing through the far turn, was
urged to challenged in that path while being fanned four wide leaving the furlong marker but was outkicked by the top pair. BARREL OF BLISS, forwardly
placed along the rail prompting the pace, conceded the lead racing into the backstretch to track just off the pacesetter, switched outside that foe racing to
the far turn to bid between rivals nearing upper stretch, struck the front nearing midstretch but had no final kick. MAGIC SOLUTION, reserved along the
inside as part of the last flight racing to the backstretch, switched out racing through the far turn, was fanned four, then five wide racing through the stretch
but continued willingly to gain position to the end. SPIN CLASS tracked off the first flight between rivals to the backstretch, was fanned four wide between
foes into upper stretch but had no rally. VOW SAVER settled last to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. SAYOH was urged to force the pace
outside a rival leaving the chute, angled to the rail once gaining the advantage racing into the backstretch to set the pace to the second bend, dueled inside
foes through the far turn to upper stretch and emptied out late. UPPER SPEED DS tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch and faded
early.

Footnotes
CENTRAL PARK broke readily while being brushed, switched out stalking the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, was urged to advance on that foe
in the three path nearing upper stretch, shifted inwards under pressure racing past midstretch but edged forward in time under steady left handed
encouragement. HAUNTEDBYTHEMUSIC broke inwards brushing the eventual winner, was urged away to a clear advantage shifting in to the two path
leaving the chute, set pace off the rail to upper stretch, resisted the winner's challenge to late stages but came up second best. DOWNTOWNER angled
inside tracking off the first flight racing to the turn, switched out entering the lane and continued with a mild bid while prevailing for a share. HIDE THE
DEMON shifted to the four path in early stages tracking off the first and continued evenly to late stages. BRANCO MARIA switched off the inside racing past
the chute to track off the first flight between foes racing into the turn, then faded into the lane. TUDOX EXPECTATIONS settled last to the turn, came under
under pressure to advance early but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
RIDGELYSREDHOT, in touch with the first flight in the opening stages, was rated stalking just off those rivals between foes just off the inside to the
backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to just collar the leader in the closing stages to prevail under firm
handling. KAUFY FUTURES, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, went clear nearing the far turn,
held sway on a comfortable advantage under pressure past midstretch but was collared nearing the wire while just lasting for second. MARIALUISA ducked
inwards at the start cutting off BIZ MAKER, then pinching back LONG STORY SHORT, track off the first flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled
to the rail racing into the stretch and was steadily gaining in late stages. DREAMINOFDASIES tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight, shifted three
wide nearing upper stretch but had no final kick. VANA GRAND settled off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside on
the far turn and continued with an effort to gain some position. LONG STORY SHORT, pinched back at the start, continued evenly three wide between foes
into the lane. BIG BOSS LADY, held up off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out five wide leaving the far turn but offered no
rally. BIZ MAKER, cut off at the start, settled last to the backstretch and proved no threat. LITTLE MS BROADWAY, urged to a forward placing four wide
racing to the first turn, retreated early. CAN'T KATZ HER urged between foes prompting the pace, gave way after a half.

QUEEN OF THE GREEN, reserved between foes racing to the first turn, shifted to the inside, saved ground through the far turn, tipped out to split foes four
wide in upper stretch then wrested the advantage and went clear in the closing stages to prove best under firm handling. SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY was
settled along the inside racing to the first turn, angled outside rivals after a half, was prompted to advance four wide on the far turn, was fanned six wide into
upper stretch but continued willingly in that path to prove best of the others. TAPWOOD tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, was urged to
challenge three wide nearing upper stretch, contested the issue between foes in that path past the furlong marker but was outkicked by the top pair.
CASTLE KING tracked the pace between foes off the second flight, shifted out to split foes four wide racing into upper stretch but finished evenly late.
JIMMY P tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted off the rail to race in close quarters between foes entering upper
stretch and lacked the needed final kick. NIGHT THINGS tracked the pacesetter along the inside as part of the second flight, advanced along the rail
nearing upper stretch to challenge for command inside foes but flattened out leaving the furlong marker. MAJOR FRONTIER settled off the second flight
racing to the backstretch, continued three deep between foes into the lane but had no late response. TAPSASIONAL, urged to the lead while angling to the
inside, dictated the pace a bit off the rail racing into the far turn and gave way between foes leaving midstretch. TRADE DEAL tracked off the second flight
