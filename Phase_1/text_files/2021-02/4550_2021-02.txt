unhurried to the turn, raced evenly in the drive with no kick when needed. SILK SPECTRE raced evenly and never untracked with no gain in the drive.
EMMYRATES had a tardy start, far back to the stretch and only improved position late. MARIAH'S GIRL raced a wide trip, close up to the stretch but wilted
in the drive. NIAGARA'S DIVA never far back to the stretch, outpaced in the stretch run. COMEONBETSY never threatened. DOLLY MINGUN completely
eliminated at the start with no chance. RACE SMART bothered start, never prominent. DIMPLES OF VENUS wheeled at the start, lost rider and bothered
foe also and walked off.
