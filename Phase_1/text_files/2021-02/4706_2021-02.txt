Footnotes
MONEY HOUSE, urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, came
under firm right handed pressure to turn back several rivals leaving the far turn to go clear into upper stretch and widened the advantage late under steady
pressure. DOHKO, forwardly placed between foes attending the pace to the backstretch, was urged to press the issue entering the far turn to upper stretch
but proved no match for the winner. PRIVATE ASTRAY tracked just off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out four wide entering the
far turn while being prompted to advance but had no closing response. KALININGRAD broke outwards making contact with IRISH MAIL at the start, was
reserved last to the backstretch dropping well off the leaders, angled out four wide racing into the stretch but made no real impression.
OLLYSILVEREXPRESS, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, was prompted to lodge a brief bid in that path
midway through the far turn but emptied out nearing upper stretch. IRISH MAIL, bumped at the start while a bit slow into stride, was prompted to a position
outside a rival to race in second flight to the backstretch but dropped back early.

ALL GOOD TIMES, outpaced in the opening stages while coming under some pressure to maintain contention, gradually gathered momentum entering the
turn, gained position between foes nearing upper stretch, shifted out four wide nearing the sixteenth marker while finding her best stride late and wrested a
clear advantage in time under firm handling. STARSHIP REINA was prompted to a forward placing along the inside, tracked just off the pacesetter racing to
the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch to challenge for command, gained a narrow advantage midstretch but proved no match when confronted by
the winner. SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT hopped at the start, was righted to track off the second flight while angling to the inside on the backstretch, advanced to
challenge the leaders along the rail entering upper stretch and was just outkicked by the top pair. RUSSIAN ROULETTE sprinted clear of the field while
angling over leaving the chute, set the pace to upper stretch while shifting a bit off the rail and gave way between foes leaving midstretch. ITALIAN
JUSTICE was urged to a forward placing, tracked the pacesetter outside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the turn, drifted out nearing upper
stretch and gave way. STORMY MUSIC dropped out early.

R D BLESSING was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside leaving the chute, steadily gained position along the inside racing into the turn, bid
for command inside the pacesetter nearing upper stretch, then shifted out contesting the issue a bit off the rail through the closing stages and just held
CHILLIN LADY on a narrow advantage to the end under right handed pressure. The latter was prompted to a forward placing while shifting off the inside
racing through the backstretch, tracked just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, shifted outside that foe to challenge for command three deep racing into
upper stretch, contested the issue to the end but was just outkicked. A FOOLISH FANCY, caught five wide in the opening stages, continued four wide into
the turn tracking off the second flight, shifted five wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest in late stages to edge a rival for a share. BEND THE
KNEE was settled last in the opening stages while angling to the inside, saved ground to upper stretch while making steady progress into the lane but
lacked the needed final kick. BENNY'S GIRLFRIEND tracked the pacesetter three wide as part of the second flight racing to the turn, shifted out to race four
wide between foes nearing upper stretch but steadily faded entering the lane. MEANASASNAKE bobbled at the start, was quickly righted, then urged to go
clear racing through the backstretch, set the pace a bit off the rail racing into the turn but gave out between foes once headed in upper stretch. TYPICALLY
tracked off the second flight between foes on the backstretch but dropped out early. MISS UTOPIA shifted out five wide racing through the backstretch and
soon dropped out.

Footnotes
NOWITNA RIVER was settled in hand outside foes racing through the backstretch, angled out five wide entering the lane and found her best stride in the
closing stages to wrest the advantage and go clear in time under firm right handed pressure. MAST COVE broke awkwardly while getting away slowly,
tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, gained position inside rivals racing into upper stretch, then shifted three wide near midstretch
but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors late. RATTLESNAKEROSE angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival racing into the turn,
edged forward of that foe near midstretch and prevailed for a share while failing to contain the top pair. PROBABLY GRACE was urged inside rivals
disputing the lead from the outset into the turn and weakened leaving the furlong marker. DO WHAT IT TAKES switched out in early stages to track off the
first flight, was fanned four wide between foes into the stretch but had no final kick. GIPSEY SORCERESS, forwardly placed between foes in the opening
stages, shifted to the inside to track off the first flight racing into the turn but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
A. K. SAFARI broke readily, was urged inside rivals to gain a narrow advantage racing into the turn, dictated the pace just off the rail racing into the far turn,
shook clear in upper stretch while shifting out and widened his advantage under right handed pressure. RAG TAG, in touch with the eventual winner in the
opening stages prompting that rival's pace, was urged to press the issue on the far turn, shifted inwards racing into upper stretch and proved no match while
best of the others. STARSHIP BUTLER, urged to a forward placing three deep tracking just off the leaders to the backstretch, continued in that path to the
far turn, shifted inwards nearing upper stretch and faded in the drive while lasting for a share. NIP OF BOURBON tracked off the first flight three wide flight
to the backstretch, was prompted to make brief progress four wide entering the second bend but faded nearing the lane. KITTEN'S CLOWN, carried inwards
at the start by SHIPWRECK, was settled along the inside and never gained contention. SHIPWRECK ducked inwards at the start bothering a rival, tracked
off the first flight inside rivals to the backstretch and faded after a half. DISTINCTIVE ECHO dropped out early.

Footnotes
PACIFIC PRINCESS tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the turn, commenced a steady advance three deep nearing upper stretch and just
edged BETO'S GIRL in the closing stages under brisk right handed pressure. The latter ducked out at the start, was rated off the second flight nearest the
inside racing to the turn, advanced along the rail nearing upper stretch to gain a brief advantage but couldn't fend off the winner. MY DIRTY MARTINI, off
slowly, then momentarily cut off at the start, settled into stride, then split foes just off the inside racing into the stretch and continued willingly to prevail for a
share while closing the gap on the top pair. SMOKIN CLASS, restless prior to loading in the gate, was urged between foes disputing the pace on a narrow
advantage racing into the turn and gave way leaving midstretch. BRIGHT AND SHINY tracked off the second flight three wide between foes racing to the
turn but had no closing bid. GONE DREAMING, caught in close quarters at the break, was urged to a forward placing along the inside racing to the turn but
gave way early. CALIFORNIA REIGN broke slowly and was caught wide throughout while proving no threat. SMOOTH DANCER, prominent three wide in
the opening quarter, gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
HACHACHA broke readily to gain a forward placing near the inside, switched off the inside on the backstretch tracking the pacesetter from just out of
striking distance, was prompted to advance bidding for command nearing upper stretch and edged clear leaving the furlong marker under firm handling.
UNCLE CHARMING broke sharply, was urged clear racing a bit off the rail to the backstretch, briefly resisted the winner's bid racing into upper stretch but
proved no match late while besting the others. NEFARIOUS FELLA tracked the leaders three wide in second flight to the backstretch, shifted in on the far
turn briefly closing the gap on the top pair nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the closing stages. POSEIDONS MYTH tracked off the second flight
between foes racing to the backstretch but offered no closing bid while continuing evenly into the lane. NOTHIN REALLY settled well off the field racing to
the far turn and passed only tiring rivals. TIZ TRIUMPHANT tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the far turn and steadily retreated
nearing the lane. KINDLY off slowly, dropped well off the field and trailed those rivals to the stretch. ATWATER tracked the leaders inside rivals in second
flight and emptied out after a half.

upper stretch, took over midstretch and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. SACRAMENTO Q settled between foes in the opening stages, was
prompted to gain position inside rivals entering the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and wrested the place honors late. DOODLE HOPPER tracked
off the second flight along the inside early, gathered momentum switching out on the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and continued well
enough to prevail for a share. MIGHTY GHOST vied for the lead three wide between foes through the backstretch into the turn and weakened leaving
midstretch. SECRET LIFE STYLE, urged between foes disputing the pace through the backstretch, dueled inside foes into upper stretch and gave way in
late stages. SNAP HOOK tracked off the first flight three wide through the backstretch but faded early. HARD WEST was off slowly and never gained
