Footnotes
KINGSTON TIME rounded the first turn about the four path and raced with the pace leaving the half mile pole, dueled clear into the far turn, came under
steady handling into the stretch, but was hand ridden the final sixteenth. DEVILISH BEAUTY stalked off the rail then picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole, took over second two deep midway on the far turn and dueled through the lane to maintain that position. COOL MO came through the opening
turn about the three path and raced with the pace two deep while between horses into the backstretch, dueled close from the half mile pole but dropped
back into the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. SKYLAR'S TRICK raced hemmed in off the heels of YOUR EYES TO MINE through
the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, eased outward to the six path on the far turn and showed little more in the lane, while the latter, set the early
pace inside, gave chase into the backstretch then faded into the far turn. ESTHER'S FORTUNE rounded the first turn in the three path and raced outside
into the backstretch, was carried to the seven path on the far turn and showed little in the lane.

came through the far turn five wide, then dueled through the stretch to take the nod for second. FRENCH NOUGET settled off the earlier pace in the two
and three paths, started an outside bid nearing the three eighths pole and ran six wide on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn but missed the nod for second.
CASTLEINTHEMEADOW settled off the early pace then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran off the rail on the far turn, though, flattened
stride inside the sixteenth pole. MISS FORESTER settled back inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, then flattened
stride. PROCIDANA saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. BRASS MAGNOLIA settled off

SLEEPING GIANT chased toward the outside and raced at even terms three wide on the turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and held on under steady
encouragement. PORT MORE gave chase through the backstretch and was eased six wide through the turn, then dug in leaving the eighth pole to take
second the final yards while gaining on the winner. WIZARD OF ODDS chased, raced in the three path of the turn, dug in from the head of the lane but was
outfinished for second the final yards. THAT'S HISTORY came away unprepared then picked up the chase outside, raced in the six path of the turn and
finished evenly. BEARCAT KITTEN set a pressured pace inside, dueled with the edge nearest the rail on the turn, was caught mid-stretch and flattened the
final sixteenth. JAXBRADENRISHI pressured the pace and dueled at even terms two deep while between horses leaving the quarter pole, but, dropped

BLACK CANDY set a pressured pace inside, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, widened into the lane and just lasted in an all out drive.
TRUFFLES AND GOLD gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the five path, dug in from the top of the lane to take second at the wire,
and just missed the win. WINDSORS FOR IT pressured the pace and dug in a close factor three wide on the turn, was steadily encouraged from the head of
the lane, though, nipped from second under the wire. FRANKEE MERCH chased from the outside, left the turn in the seven path and finished evenly. TRUE
HEIR gave chase from well back, came through the turn in the three path and was not asked in the lane. MALETTA gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn
but lost his rider while jumping over MIO'S LONG TERM at the eighth pole, while the latter, pressured the pace through the backstretch and dueled at a
close disadvantage two deep rounding the turn, but, suffered a fatal injury nearing the eighth pole and was euthanized on the track. The Stewards posted
the inquiry prior to declaring this race official.

Footnotes
MALIBU SPLASH angled in to stalk two deep from the five eighths pole and raced at even terms toward the half, took the advantage approaching the seven
sixteenths, came under pressure at the three eighths and contested the edge two deep on the far turn, briefly ceded the lead past the eighth pole but dug in
under determined handling to recover in the final yards. BRIGINTINE ISLAND set the pace inside the first turn but was met into the backstretch, gave chase
from that point and contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn, recovered the lead past the eighth pole but relented, grudgingly, in the
final yards. NAVY SWORD saved ground off the pace the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, angled to the
three path leaving the turn and dueled through the stretch for third. SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS steadied early then saved ground the first turn, eased out with
a bid into the backstretch, improved in the five path of the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. BOUNDTOBEBAD rounded the first turn
about the three path then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn but showed little further.
MORALITY CLAUSE raced in the five path the opening turn and settled off the pace entering the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths
pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. ANGLE OF ATTACK rated just off the early pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole then weakened in the
three path of the far turn. JOY FANTASTIC raced in the six path the first turn and settled just off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole but weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
HE SURPRISED ME broke sharply and took quick control of a short lead, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far
turn and was steadily handled through the lane. SHORT CAKE'S MAN settled off the early pace about the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole and
raced in the three path entering the far turn, was carried out toward the head of the lane but dug in through the stretch to take the nod for second. CASTLE
ONE raced well back while saving ground the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn six wide
then dueled through the stretch, though, missed the nod for second. DEPUTY JAMES rated close to the early pace in the three path, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened out the final eighth. DEPUTY BEE raced in the five path the first turn then stalked into the
backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, entered the far turn in the three path but drifted toward the head of the lane and flattened stride.
BRAVE NATIVE stalked two deep the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, then faded into the far turn. I'MOVERTHEMOON raced
in the four path the opening turn and settled just off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened two deep on
the far turn. MASTER YOO was never a factor. ISLAND CADGER bobbled from the gate and rounded the first turn in the six path, raced outside into the
backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, though flattened in the three path of the far turn.
