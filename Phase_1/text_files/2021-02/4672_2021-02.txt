Footnotes
TURN TO ME SUCREE prompted the early pace from the inside, inherited the lead entering the turn, shook clear in upper stretch and prevailed under mild
urging. SOUTH BEACH GIRL never far back, rallied through the stretch in the five path and finished well clear for second. CHIT CHATTING chased the
pace into the stretch then faded late. EASY EYES moved up three wide on the turn then came up empty. MISS IRISH BOSS was void of early speed and
never involved. AWESOME MACHINE set the pace two wide down the backstretch, got out on the turn then gave way. SECRET PRINCESS bucked leaving
the gate and unseated her rider. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
ODIE broke well and made the lead shortly after the start, set all the pace and maintained his advantage under right handed urging in the four path.
KRAMMY BOY unhurried early, swung wide, closed determinedly in the middle of the racetrack and finished clear for second. SILENT TIGER chased the
winner and went evenly in the five path. KEYED ON TOP stalked the pace and also turned in an even effort in the six path. IRISH CAT settled mid pack and
lacked the needed response. IRISH PROUD was no factor. KENTUCKY KITTEN had brief speed then stopped. CHROMIUM trailed.

Footnotes
ATTUCK dueled for the lead two wide then along the inside into the turn, dropped back a bit, came on again through mid stretch to regain the lead and won
under right handed urging. CUMBER broke in front, battled for the lead four then three wide the entire trip and finished gamely for second. TRY TRY AGAIN
never far back, found his best stride late in the six path. OVERBEARING matched strides for the early lead along the inside, took back and angled out on
the turn then came on again five wide through the stretch. QUASAR MOON allowed to settle inside, inched closer on the turn, shifted out to the three path,
lacked room behind rivals at the top of the stretch, angled out a bit then finished evenly. KHALFANI battled for the lead two wide until deep stretch then
weakened. SAINTS MARCHING IN close up, was through after a half. NANO trailed into the stretch, offered a mild bid along the inside then came up empty
in the final furlong.

horses in the four path through the final stages but was outfinished. CASPIAN TALE trailed into the stretch then had a mild late rally in the six path.
GENTLE KISS broke in front, set the pace until deep stretch then weakened. MCKINLI'SBABYBLUES was in tight entering the clubhouse turn, had speed
