Footnotes
GOLDEN KEY rated a short lead and rounded the turn near the rail, came under pressure into the stretch and held on well. NOCASHREFUNDS chased
inside, raced at the rail on the turn and dueled through the stretch for second. SPANGLISH gave early chase outside, raced three wide on the turn then
outfinished in the stretch duel for second. NOID gave chase and raced at the rail on the turn while passing rivals. VIDMER'S COURAGE engaged in close
early chase and raced between horses on the turn, then weakened past the eighth pole. ENTRY TIME chased through the backstretch, raced in the three
path of the turn and showed little further. JACKSON MAN chased the leaders and raced in the three path of the turn, but drifted into the lane and showed
little more.

Footnotes
FAPPIANO ROCKET tapered to the inside and took the lead nearing the three quarter pole, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and held
well with steady handling. SLEW THE TURN stalked toward the inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and finished well to be second
best. RAVIN' MAVEN raced just off the early pace, rounded the turn near the rail and flattened stride; a distant third. BRILLIANT IDEAS raced well off the
early pace in the two and three paths, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened. TAMAQUA settled off the pace about the three path the opening turn
and showed little response down the backstretch. FIBERTOWN stalked from the two and three paths then picked up the chase nearing the three eighths
pole, though, faded through the far turn. WHERE'S THE LIME saved ground.

Footnotes
THE PREDICTOR took over into the first turn and rated a slim lead inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled clear of Envision Success leaving the
five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and held on under steady encouragement. KATMAN QUICK stalked inside, bid leaving the three eighths
pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then dug in through the lane to hold onto second. UHWARRIE SKY rated off the earlier pace about the three
path, bid nearing the quarter pole, raced in the four path the far turn and finished well at the outside girth of Katman Quick. ENVISION SUCCESS raced in
the four path the first two turns and bid at even terms into the backstretch, but dropped back at the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three
path and weakened. TIZEZZY raced in the five path the first two turns and picked up the chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the six path but
showed little in the lane. APPROVETHISMESSAGE saved early ground close to the early pace, gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole then flattened
stride in the three path of the far turn. FRANKIE DOTS showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
STOP TALKING was hustled to the lead nearing the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the turn, was steadily handled to
mid-stretch then taken in hand later yards. I'M A TOTAL DIVA chased through the backstretch and raced near the rail on the turn, dueled clear of Royal
Athena in the upper stretch but couldn't improve further. GREAT CAUSE chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path, drifted a bit
into the stretch and was along for third later yards. ROYAL ATHENA broke in the air then picked up the early chase outside, rounded the turn about the
three path but flattened stride inside the eighth pole. PACIFIC GOLD pressured the pace from the three eighths pole but steadied at the rail into the turn and
weakened. LINEAGE broke awkwardly and gave only distant chase outside, rounded the turn about the five path then passed rivals outside. MAGNIFICENT
ROCKET gave chase, though never factored. SHACKLETOWN gave chase inside and raced at the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
AWESOME BUZZ stalked the earlier pace from the three path then bid leaving the three eighths pole, contested the far turn at a close disadvantage while
two deep, took the nod nearing the sixteenth pole and inched clear later yards. SILVER CASTLE took the lead approaching the three quarter pole and rated
a slim lead toward the inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, gave up the nod
toward the sixteenth pole and reluctantly relented later yards. SKY GAZER R V F saved ground off the pace the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, then finished well while gaining on the runner-up. EASTPORT settled off the pace in the two and three paths the
first turn, started an outside bid leaving the half mile pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride.
SOUTHERN SAVIOUR stalked inside then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded off the rail on the far turn. BANISHMENT
raced well off the pace in the four path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. I'LL MAKE U FAMOUS saved ground and showed
little response through the backstretch. GLAD MOON (GER) rounded the opening turn in the four and five paths then faded past the seven sixteenths pole.
SAVE ME PAULA raced well off the pace in the five path the first turn and was never a factor.

OUR DIAMOND GIRL ducked in to make contact with Vintage Gin leaving the gate then picked up the chase beyond the chute, dueled to the lead two deep
midway on the turn, drew clear mid-stretch and widened the final sixteenth. GANDHI'S CASTLE was hustled clear leaving the chute and set the pace inside,
gave up the lead at the rail midway through the turn, dropped back mid-stretch and just lasted for second. MISS WAVE chased the pace, steadied past the
five sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the turn, dug in from the head of the lane and just missed second in an even finish. KATALIMA chased
through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and finished evenly. ADDY'S LOVE gave chase and raced just off the rail on the turn
then flattened stride. VINTAGE GIN was bumped off stride shortly out of the gate then picked up the chase outside.

Footnotes
WINDSORS FOR IT chased through the backstretch and improved off the rail on the turn, drifted a bit into the lane but dug in for the lead inside the
sixteenth pole and raced clear under the wire. EPIC WEST was hustled to the lead past the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the
turn, gave up the lead inside the sixteenth pole and relented later yards. WILLIE THE WHALE gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and finished
evenly. TANELEER pressured the pace through the backstretch, lost some ground on the turn, entered the stretch about the four path and finished evenly.
WINDSOR CALLING gave chase and raced off the rail on the turn then finished evenly. ADIOS SEE YA raced well back from early contention and rounded
the turn in the two and three paths. GATTOSING gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened. TRUTH SERUM checked leaving the gate,
gave early chase outside and was not a factor. FROSTY'S MAJESTY chased toward the outside then faded in the five path of the turn. JUST GO WITH IT
gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the seven path.
