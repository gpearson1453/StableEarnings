Footnotes
JUDGE BERN was guided over to the rail well before arriving at the conclusion of the backstretch, got put to a brisk hand ride to keep pace with the front
runners on the turn, cut the corner into the lane with the runner up now more in the two path than before, narrowed in during the ensuing furlong, maintained
the momentum springing from the eighth pole, finally slipping by in deep stretch to steal the verdict. B C GLORY DAYS secured a forward position after the
field had been sent off and running, vied for command at or near the inside for the initial three-quarters, slid towards path two spinning into the lane,
inadvertently, as it turned out, providing a window of opportunity for the eventual winner, dug in with determination, mostly from between opponents,
desperately clinging to a slim advantage, got nipped in the shadow of the finish line. VODKA LEMONADE pursued the pace from path two in between rivals
until the five-sixteenths pole, was just as wide entering the turn, became entangled in a blind switch a few jumps later, was taken in hand and eased back as
a means of escape, tipped to the outside in midstretch after becoming free of the previously-described predicament, rallied mildly en route for the show.
WHAT'S MY CATEGORY disputed the pace towards path two for the opening six furlongs, continued to do battle from upper to midstretch only now from
path three, weakened in the final furlong. TALES OF SARATOGA three wide, began to back away as three-quarters was being rattled off, swung out five
wide into the lane on empty and backed away further.

Footnotes
MACHO JACK coaxed from the gate, raced four wide in aim of the fracas up front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths stacked outside the top pair
between rivals, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between foes taking narrow command a furlong out and gamely inched away
nearing the finish to prevail. TAPIZEARANCE brushed at the start by ECONOMIC POLICY, who broke outwards, chased four then five wide from just off the
pace, advanced into contention nearing the quarter pole and went five wide into upper stretch, rallied to latch on the top pair through the final furlong, battled
on outside those rivals to the finish but was ultimately repelled. TRUEBELIEVE dueled from the two path with BEACH FRONT to his inside with a pair of
rivals in close range to the outside, had that pair advance outside and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when holding narrow advantage, spun just
off the inside for home, dug in under threat from a pair, got headed a furlong out and fought on through to the finish clear of the rest. DR. DEVERA'S WAY
coaxed from the gate, raced three wide in aim of the duel, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in
the late stages. BEACH FRONT dueled inside of TRUEBELIEVE, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
weakened. BEND IN THE RIVER coaxed from the gate, raced four paths off the inside down the backstretch until tucked to the inside nearing the half mile
pole, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ECONOMIC POLICY broke out at the start
brushing TAPIZEARANCE and was corrected, chased five then four wide under a ride from midway on the turn, cornered four wide into upper stretch and
trailed throughout.

SEETHISQUICK away without apparent mishap, pursued the front runners from path two on the backstretch, slid over to the rail approaching the top of the
turn, abandoned it and began to get maneuvered to the outside a furlong later, wound up in the three path by the five-sixteenths pole, was under a ride
angling one wider into the stretch, closed in on the one to catch in a steadfast manner, wrested away the advantage for good in the final seventy yards and
edged clear. DIRTY two wide onto the turn, swung out into path five entering the top of the lane, straightened away and rallied for the place. PROFESSOR
SNAPE rode the rail for the initial half, went three wide into the stretch, narrowed in to get up for the show. SKYLER'S SCRAMJET took up position in
midpack, was set down to a full hard drive nearing the five-sixteenths pole, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, mustered up a mild response
sufficient enough for the last major check. EARNED SUCCESS sparred for command from the two path, well rated early, began to shake free of the
nemesis late on the bend, was put to a drive for the stretch run, relinquished a short distance beyond the sixteenth pole, weakened to finish off the board.
RELEASETHETHUNDER tracked the pace from along the inside route until the quarter pole, tipped into the two path at the head of the stretch, lacked the
necessary response and backed away. KAMPAI along the inside, vied for control for nearly a half, came into the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
SIENA MAGIC hustled from the gate, showed the way early on before tussling briefly with DAVID'S GEM prior to that rival taking over, tucked inside half a
mile from home and gave chase while under light coaxing through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths
and inched away under a drive to prevail. MISTER BOBBY bumped lightly at the start by DAVID'S GEM, who broke in a step, chased five then four wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, ran on to chase the winner home securing the place honors clear on the wire. BRILLIANT
BROOKS chased six then five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, then
flattened out in the late stages. JAKE ROCKS four paths off the inside briefly, tucked to chase along the inside, came under coaxing midway on the turn,
angled four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. DAVID'S GEM broke in a step at the start bumping MISTER BOBBY, tussled briefly from the
three path on the front with SIENA MAGIC before emerging with sole command near the half mile pole, tucked to the two path through the turn shaking
away to a safe lead, swung two to three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, dug in under threat from a trio and was overwhelmed and collared at
the three-sixteenths, then weakened to the finish. THE BIG S coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, faded nearing the quarter pole and went three wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
GOOD CULTURE loped along the inside for nearly three-quarters, began to tip to the outside late on the bend, was worked into path three during the
opening half of the stretch run, kicked in and began to close the gap readily, gained the lead with slightly under a sixteenth to go and edged clear. SONO
GRATO pursued the pace from the two path, was gradually worked into path five during the drive, rallied for second. I AM THE LAW took up residence in
the two path after the field had been sent off and running, flashed interest when let out a notch springing from the five-sixteenths pole, swung out into path
four stepping onto the head of the stretch, charged to the front deep into the furlong grounds, got overhauled by GOOD CULTURE approximately a
sixteenth later, steadily weakened into the show slot. WILL E SUTTON settled into the two path, was between opponents contending for the top during the
journey from the three-quarters marker until midway on the turn, saw FROSTED INDIAN momentarily shake free, re-surged and went on to re-bid for the top
approaching the quarter pole, kept up this second quest until midstretch before flattening out. EXALTED CHARM underwent a ground-saving journey, made
no impact. LEMON DROP ROAD in path three, argued for command from early on the backstretch until the three-eighths pole before giving way. FROSTED
INDIAN cut over to the inside, was the innermost of three vying for the top from the top of the backstretch to midway on the turn, kicked clear during the
second half of the run around the bend, surrendered when pounced upon in upper stretch and backed away. RUN SMITTY RUN sighted three wide at the
top of the turn, failed to menace.

Footnotes
HEIRLOOM KITTEN four then three wide in pursuit, advanced and came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied
to latch on the leader and dueled through the final furlong in game fashion to get on near even terms inside the final sixteenth and got the nod on the wire.
SUPREME AURA chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over command and
swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under growing threat and dueled through the final furlong with the aforementioned foe fighting on
game but lost the bob at the finish. SUPER DUDE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and came under threat near the quarter pole, got displaced from the front and spun two to three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive running on to secure the show honors clear of the rest. LADDIE LIAM three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. RUNABOUT chased along the inside under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, cornered three wide into upper stretch and weakened. AMERICAN LINCOLN forwardly placed three then two wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ELOQUENT SPEAKER tucked into the three path prior to departing the backstretch, sat within range of the front runners, settled onto the top of the lane
and got cued up, out-fought a pair of opponents to her inside from the three-sixteenths pole to the furlong marker to take over, dug in with willingness to stay
in the clear. WAILIN JOSIE took up position in midpack, was well held stalking the front runners from path two during the run around the bend, got worked
into the four path from upper to midstretch, rallied for the place. SHESASUPERFREAK cut over to the rail after establishing control in short order, threw
down the opening two splits with the pilot utilizing a snug grip on the reins, was asked for more as a pair of opponents zoomed in in upper stretch,
relinquished, then weakened into the show slot. FLUSH stalked the pacesetter from path two for the opening half, got called upon for the drive, ventured
onward as a prominent factor for another furlong before weakening. QUIETUDE steadied after lunging out at the break, was tipped to the outside after
pulling a bit on the bit proceeding along the backstretch, travelled two to three wide on the turn, got sent out into path five from upper to midstretch, had no
closing punch. IFIHADACHANCE coaxed along on the turn while pocketed, cut the corner into the lane, failed to fire apperciably. MORE GLITTER guided
over to the rail nearing the conclusion of the backstretch, waited in line as the half was being completed, was maneuvered out six wide for the best of room
once in the stretch, lacked a response.

Footnotes
MAKE MISCHIEF tracked the pace along the inside briefly taking to the two path down the backstretch before tucking back to the rail into the turn, came
under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied up the rail and was placed in tight as the leader BRATTLE HOUSE
came in a path closing down the inside, got brushed a furlong out and had the rail open up near the sixteenth marker, rallied on through to knock heads to
the finish and was up in the last jumps to the wire. BRATTLE HOUSE established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide leaving very
little room along the inside through the turn, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, got directed inwards under an off sided stick about a path
nearing the eighth pole attempting to force MAKE MISCHIEF to go around, brushed with that rival while under a left grip, came under urging and an off
sided stick drifting out a sixteenth from home, knocked heads to the finish and was caught in the final strides while clear for the place honors. VACAY
chased two to three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, got let out spinning along the inside route into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to
secure the show honors. SHANES PRETTY LADY broke out at the start bumping IRISH CONSTITUTION, chased three to four wide, got roused spinning
three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. FROST ME chased along the inside until tipped out four wide at the seven-sixteenths, came
under urging three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. IRISH CONSTITUTION brushed the near side stall when
breaking inwards then got bumped by SHANES PRETTY LADY breaking outwards a step, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. SECRET LOVE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch in retreat and faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
SCORPION DYNASTY grabbed the advantage in short order, was guided onto the inside route, showed the way being coaxed along, attended by
CONFECTIONER from the outside, inched away from the aforementioned late on the bend, got called upon for more coming onto the head of the stretch,
held on well in the final furlong to hold sway. WARFRONT FIGHTER firmly rated in the pocket keeping an eye on the winner, tipped into the two path at the
three-sixteenths pole, got staved off while finishing well clear of the others for the place. CONFECTIONER prompted the winner from path two for nearly a
half, came under stronger handling prior to the quarter pole, backed away steadily down the lane, saved the show. DUTCHMEN FOREVER two wide onto
the turn, commenced the stretch one wider, got outfinished. KITH took up residence in midpack, was at a slight distance off the rail pursuing the front
runners on the turn, swung out four wide for the drive, made no headway. OUCH OUCH OUCH saved ground for nearly a half, got driven into path two
entering the stretch, gave way. MACLEAN'S LEGACY failed to menace off a ground-saving journey. WISECRACK off a half length the slowest, raced three
wide, got sent out into path five from upper to midstretch, venturing onward as the widest, wound up trailing throughout.
