Footnotes
OUR DIXIE BLUE quickly took control, began widening on the turn and remained well clear while kept to her task. PALOMA GRIS lagged far behind,
advanced very wide while no threat to the winner. ONE TOUGH ROSE pursued the winner to the stretch and came up empty. MIRACULOUSBLESSING
angled inside with a brief bid on the turn then weakened late. HEY DEWZPOTS dropped back after the start and lacked a rally. BIG BROWN EYES trailed
long way and was never in contention. DANZING THE POLKA was outrun from the opening inside and gave way readily.

THIS ROUND'S MINE quickly moved clear, widened in mid stretch then lasted while tiring in the final sixteenth. MISQUILLO lagged far behind then split
foes with good energy too late. LUCKY IMAGINATION broke sluggishly, advanced inside and made a gradual gain. CASTILLEJA pursued the winner then
flattened out through the stretch. LIGHT UP NIGHT dropped well behind outside and lacked a rally. BORDERLINE GENIUS broke very slowly and raced far
back and was never in contention. THREE POTATOE FOUR raced close up inside then began fading on the turn.

Footnotes
GRAY LITTLE MEADOW was bumped at the start, set a pressured pace on the inside, shook free on the far turn, drifted out some bumping with INSPIRED
OPTIONS at the sixteenth marker and then dug in gamely to prevail. CALL FITZROY was bumped at the start and steadied, raced off the pace inside,
angled out at the quarter pole, rallied outside, put a head in front in deep stretch and was outfinished. INSPIRED OPTIONS pressed the pace in the two
path, chased on the far turn, rallied between horses, drifted in and bumped with GRAY LITTLE MEADOW near the sixteenth marker and was outfinished.
SHILOH LANE was outrun early, saved ground and passed tired ones. OUR UNCLE DREW raced three wide early, chased three wide, advanced inside on
the far turn and tired. KEVINS CHIOCE was bumped at the start and outrun. SUNSHINE CRUSADER raced four wide early, chased close up four wide and

MIA BELLA ROSSA set a measured pace inside, repelled a strong challenge on the final turn then drew off under moderate pressure. SQUAN'S KINGDOM
settled inside, made a menacing bid midway on the final turn but proved no match for the winner. ATINA SALSA broke slowly, saved ground early and
continued willingly. I'M NOT JOKING lagged well behind then passed tiring rivals while wide. SKI BUNNY rated off the leaders, was asked for run on the
final turn but faded. SLINGIN SAMMY B prompted the pace wide for half a mile and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
THE POOCH vied three wide throughout, repelled repeated challenges and finished gamely in a hard-earned score. PSYCHIC ENERGY settled off the
leaders, bid very wide, loomed a threat late could not get by the winner. HUYA dueled between rivals and continued willingly to the finish. SARATOGA
WILDCAT lagged far behind then showed some late energy outside. BOBCAT hustled up to duel inside then weakened in the final furlong. SMART ROYAL
T broke sluggishly, saved ground and was no factor. RETURN OF A GIANT dropped back early and was never in contention. JAMMIN JIMTOWN trailed
down the backstretch and was always outrun. CAPE MAY FERRY raced off the leaders four wide, bore out into the far turn and stopped.

Footnotes
ANGEL RAPHAEL vied for the lead outside, edged clear in mid stretch and lasted under a drive. FRISKY FEELING dropped far behind, rallied well in the
stretch but was too late. WINGS OF FURY vied outside early, moved to the rail on the turn then weakened late. IZA ONE dropped back early, moved inside
and rallied mildly. SMOKIN PRINCESS lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. KIT KAT KATIE forced the pace between rivals for half a mile and
faded. SUPERGIRL POWER lacked speed in the two path and was never a factor. CONGAREE ROSE urged just off the leaders outside and weakened.
SNOW BLOSSOM chased in mid pack and moved very wide into the stretch. PAOLLA'S HEART raced just off the pace, moved inside and gave way.
SAVANNAH'S DREAM chased far behind throughout. SPECTACULAR NOW vied inside, held a brief lead on the turn and stopped.
