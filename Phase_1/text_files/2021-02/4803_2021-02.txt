Footnotes
CHARGINA saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, advanced along the rail to take command approaching the eighth pole and drew out. ABOVE
THE LIMIT sprinted to the early lead, drifted to the four path entering the stretch losing her momentum then finished willingly. TRITONE GAL hesitated at
the break, hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased out in upper stretch and rallied nicely. IRISH SAGA raced in the two path down the backstretch and
dropped back on the turn. SPIRIT OR SPITE , reluctant to load into the starting gate, was outrun. GALOFMYDREAMS , outrun, drifted very wide leaving the
turn.

Footnotes
SILENT MALICE drafted well back off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, picked up some momentum two wide into the lane, worked between
foes past the three sixteenths, dropped in and bid inside a pair of rivals with a sixteenth to go, gained a slim lead with about sixty yards remaining and dug in
under a drive. FAST CASH settled off the pace, advanced five wide into the stretch, shifted in continuing progress past the furlong marker, bid between
runners to be on near even terms a sixteenth out, battled gamely but wasn't quite good enough. DOOBIEDOOBIEDOOBIE stalked the pace, moved up
between rivals mid turn, took closer order about three wide into the lane, forged clear past the three sixteenths, widened under a drive in mid stretch, was
confronted from his inside by the top two and weakened late. JAMMIN STILL cleared early, set the pace off the rail, could not withstand a threat past the
quarter pole and weakened. SIR BACK IN BLACK in mid pack off the rail, was under pressure five wide into the lane but lacked a bid. AMEN CORNER
saved ground, moved up into the stretch to have aim, chased and weakened a furlong out. ORDER FOR PORKY stalked off the pace and dropped back
between rivals. GOLAZO broke a bit awkwardly, raced four to five wide outside rivals while stalking early on, moved to be the closest pursuer into the turn,
remained removed from the rail around the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
TWEET AWAY ROBIN , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, gained the lead outside CALPYSO GHOST near the sixteenth pole. CALYPSO
GHOST advanced in the two path between horses to gain the lead mid way on the turn, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and gave way
grudgingly. JOYFUL NOISE hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased out to the two path turning for home and had a mild rally inside rivals. DAT DARES
GOLD , off last, rushed up in the three path between horses leaving the backstretch, prompted the pace to mid stretch then tired. RAGTIME SUZY lacked
speed, raced in the two path on the turn, angled out in upper stretch then passed tired foes. I'M SO MUNNY sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail
and weakened entering the stretch. INTROSPECTION , three deep on the turn, was fanned five wide entering the stretch and was not a factor.

WHAT THE FLASH , well back while off the rail, circled four wide into the lane, leveled off after being put to some right handed rousing near mid stretch,
closed steadily under hand urging, took command late and edged away. LADNEEDSAHANDLER , three to four wide, dropped in mid turn, moved up along
the rail into the stretch, eased out, closed while trying to get in, briefly went clear past the sixteenth pole but failed to contain the winner. BUZZHOUND , off
the pace while saving some ground, raced between rivals mid turn, swung out near the three sixteenths and finished with good energy. LITTLE BOLD
BANDIT vied outside a rival through the opening furlong, was urged clear and dropped in, opened up along the rail around the turn, had his lead dwindle
while under heavy pressure in mid stretch then tired. SPEECHIN N TEACHIN chased to the inside of a rival and came up empty. GOLDEN G vied inside,
was rated back past the five eighths, pursued around the turn then gave way.

Footnotes
KING MAURO took advantage of an inviting seam inside rivals to edge up in the opening three sixteenths, disputed the pace under rating, was roused clear
past the three sixteenths, kept on under a drive inside the sixteenth marker, wandered outward in deep stretch and prevailed. HAYNE'S FEVER , away
alertly, was taken to rate and had the winner slip through to his inside early on, tracked the pace under some rating while off the rail, circled five wide into
the lane, closed steadily on his left lead, switched to his correct lead while drifting out in deep stretch then had his rally fall just short. MARYLANDER saved
ground, moved up some past the three eighths, pursued towards the inside in the drive but came up empty. CHEYENNE BULL , towards the inside leaving
the far turn, weakened. WOLFINBARGER vied outside the winner from about the three quarter pole to upper stretch, failed to kick on past the three
sixteenths and weakened. MONKEY'S MEDAL , wide, failed to respond.

Footnotes
GENTLEMAN JOE , three deep the first turn, sprinted clear mid way down the backstretch, set the pace slightly off the rail, drifted out in mid stretch and
lasted under pressure. CROUCHELLI lacked speed, raced in the two path on the far turn and rallied near the inner rail in the stretch run. STAR SIGN , up
close down the backstretch, advanced three deep leaving the far turn then flattened out. IN HIM WITH HIM raced along the inner rails on both turns, failed
to rally and drifted out in mid stretch. JOHNG , three wide the first turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and gave way. INVEST showed speed near
the rail down the backstretch, angled out approaching the half mile pole, chased the winner to the stretch and gave way. GALILEAN MOON was not a
factor. SKIPIN ON ORCHARD , three wide the far turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
CONJECTURE prompted the pace two to three wide outside the leader, bid under asking mid turn, secured command past the three sixteenths, opened up
under encouragement leaving mid stretch then coasted home through the final seventy yards. LE WEEKEND had speed to clear, set the pace about two
wide, took pressure from the five sixteenths, ceded command in upper stretch but stayed willingly. DESBORDES , taken to rate in a forward spot and
towards the inside, eased out under pressure and had aim into the stretch, straightened away to be about four wide, failed to kick in and faded late.
HIDENSEEK SALLY , off a bit slow when rank, regrouped and chased outside a rival early on, dropped in around the turn but came up empty. GALLINELLA
drafted back off the early pace while saving some ground, angled out approaching the lane and failed to respond.

Footnotes
THE WOLFMAN chased the pace outside ESCAPABILITY, overtook that one turning for home, opened a clear lead near the eighth pole, drifted out and
held sway under steady handling. DOUBLEOSEVEN , well placed early, advanced three deep leaving the turn, had aim on the leader in upper stretch and
flattened out. HEMP , three deep entering the turn, was four deep leaving the turn and passed tired foes. ESCAPABILITY bore in leaving the starting gate,
sprinted to the early lead, set a pressured pace along the rail and weakened in the drive. SAN ANTONE bumped with MACY'S BOY at the break, raced
along the inner rail and was not a factor. MACY'S BOY bobbled then was bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate. BOBBY TWO TIMES , caught
in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, angled to the five path in upper stretch and failed to rally.

I LOVE YOU saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, eased out in upper stretch, took the lead outside MARY'S JEWEL near the sixteenth pole then
drove clear. MARY'S JEWEL chased the pace outside MAGICAL ANNA, came into the stretch in the three path, took the lead in upper stretch, finished
gamely but failed to hold off the winner. AWESOME PAL , behind horses mid way on the turn, swung to the six path turning for home and rallied nicely
outside rivals. MAGICAL ANNA set the pace along the inner rail and faded late. FOGGY DREAMS raced in the three path between horses around the turn,
chased the pace and weakened. GRACE ISABELLA bobbled at the break, raced in the four path between horses on the turn, was fanned to the seven path
turning for home then drifted in near the eighth pole. NINE MARTINIS , five deep chasing the pace on the turn, gave way.
