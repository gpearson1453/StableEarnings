reluctant to load, hopped at the start, tracked the early pace, raced seven wide through the turn, angled in mid stretch and finished second best.
BOOZYMILKSHAKEBAR was allowed to settle early, circled eight wide, passed a foe and was up for third. ATTA BOY BILLY stalked the early pace, angled
out through the turn, angled in out of the turn and offered no rally. WHISPERING WIND was unhurried early, raced four wide into the turn and never fired.
CAPITAL REEF was up close early, raced three wide and faded. GRANDPA A. C. pressed the early pace, raced six wide and gave way. GODS WRITING
