Footnotes
CEE R BEE never far back to turn, rallied in the drive to respond going away late. MASTEROFTHEHOUSE good position to stretch, strong late bid but
outfinished to wire in a good effort. TOP HAT VOYAGER well off rail with a late run to capture the show spot. STARSHIP MERCURY inside speed to duel to
deep stretch but weakened in the late going to just miss show. SUMMERDUCK dueled to deep stretch while used up with nothing left. HANK THE TANK
tracked outside to turn, faded in the stretch run. LET'S RIDE raced evenly with no late kick when needed. COME ON VENEZUELA through early, faded
from the turn. NICEANDEZ never close while outside in the stretch run. STAY IN YO LANE no speed from inside, never a factor. RED BLUE AND TRUE
tracked three wide to stretch, gave way readily. LAFLOWMYLAXBRO never a factor.

LAS RAMBLAS tracked leaders to turn three wide, cleared off as much the best while geared down in the final sixteenth. LETSGOANDGETTHEDO held up
to the turn, got through while clearly no match for the winner. DON'T MINE ME inside trip while evenly while settled for the show spot. BOW MAKER
troubled start, lost action, never recovered thereafter. CANDYCREAM speed to the front, led to the stretch and gave way readily. SHESDIAMONITE never
far back, swept four-five wide out of turn with no late bid. DESTINY'S DARLING never a real threat. CARRY ON outside trip while never close. RUBY
ROUND HERE with pace to the turn, gave way badly.
