THREEWICKEDWISHES settled comfortably towards the rear on the inside, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, rallied through a sizable opening along
the rail to make a bid at the quarter-pole, was roused for more into upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and drew away under steady urging.
BETTER BIZ bumped the hindquarters of a foe at the start then was taken up with a tug of the right rein, spotted the front a few lengths, was restrained at
the back while off heels into the first turn, advanced between horses in the two path early on that bend then moved to the three path, brushed with a foe
while carried out onto the backstretch, continued to advance coming to the five-eighths then tracked on the outside, was asked while five wide on the far
turn, made a bid inside the five-sixteenths, bumped with a rival at the quarter-pole then was pulled off of that foe, dropped to the three path into the stretch,
lost touch with the winner while still on her inside lead into the final furlong and weakened while continuing on her inside lead to the wire but was clear for
the place. MALARTACH broke out and a step slow, went three then four wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was roused three wide on the far turn and
lacked the needed response while best of the rest. LADY KAZA went well clear early, rounded the first turn in the three to four path, had the lead diminish
early on the backstretch then moved clear again while well off the inside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, lugged out and bumped with a foe at
the quarter-pole then lost the advantage inside that marker, dropped back into the stretch and tired. SHAKE D MOON was bumped in the hindquarters at
the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, came out and brushed with a foe onto the backstretch, moved up coming to the five-eighths then tracked the
pace, was asked while four wide between horses on the far turn, bumped with rivals on both sides at the quarter-pole then steadied and faltered then was
eased in the final furlong but walked off.

clear for the place. LOOKING FOR BULL broke out a bit at the start, went five wide on the first turn, settled at the rear on the outside, was roused while two
then three wide on the far turn, held a reasonable striking position under a drive into the final furlong but flattened out while just able to get the show.
REMEMBERMIS went four wide on the first turn, was urged along on the outside, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was ridden along while five wide on

Footnotes
KUHLKE bumped hard with a rival at the start, was well placed just off the pace, moved out after being shuffled back behind OURS FOREVER nearing the
half-mile pole, was roused four wide on the far turn, rallied outside to get the lead in upper stretch then drew away under steady urging. STRUMMER went
four wide under restraint on the first turn, tugged at the bit while tracking the pace on the outside, chased three wide when asked on the far turn, pursued the
winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match but was well clear for the place. SPEEDY DUDETTE bobbled then bumped hard with a rival
at the start, became rank when taken under a strong hold early, went two to three wide under vigorous urging while still rank on the first turn, was wrestled
back onto the backstretch then reserved at the rear, went five wide early on the far turn then dropped to the three path and lacked the needed response
while up for the show. DELTA TRAVELER went around the first turn in the four path, contested the pace on the outside, moved clear outside the half-mile
pole, controlled the action in the two path on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then lost the lead while put to the whip in upper stretch and tired.
HOTMOLLY broke in at the start, raced in the two to three path under restraint on the first turn, was keen onto and early on the backstretch then rated just
off the pace, came up empty along the rail on the far turn and retreated. OURS FOREVER went around the first turn in the two path, contested the pace,
dropped back outside the half-mile pole and stopped.

Footnotes
FREDA'S SMOOTH AIR showed early speed, raced in the three path on the first turn, showed the way on a clear lead down the backstretch, rounded the
far turn in the two path, was asked to pick up nearing the five-sixteenths, responded well when put to a drive in upper stretch and drew away under strong
urging. THEBOYZGALAXY was hustled from the start, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, moved out entering the backstretch, was rated in
second position, chased three then four wide on the far turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and
proved no match while clear for the place. AIR GUITAR STAR rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, moved closer midway down
the backstretch, was urged three then four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch under a drive, drifted out briefly while still on her inside lead
outside the eighth-pole and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. SINCERITY angled in early, settled on the inside while hugging the rail,
advanced much closer midway down the backstretch, continued to hug the rail on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole and came up empty.
DARLING JOANNA went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while moving from four to six wide on the far turn and
faltered.
