HUSH OF A STORM unhurried to far turn, angled out for the drive, bearing in late while hard to handle, rider did a good job keeping him off rivals in the final
sixteenth to clear and prevail. LIKE THE KING stalked pace to far turn, made a bid past quarter pole, caught in tight through late stages and backed off.
GRETZKY THE GREAT sharp break to set a pressured pace to deep stretch and stayed gamely in the stretch run. HARD RYE GUY had an awkward start,
no speed to quarter pole, made a strong bid on the rail through the final furlong put in in tight, checked hard and altered course and lost best chance.
CATMAN unhurried early, raced outside to improve position too late. TWIRLING MAMBA perfect position to far turn, outside run with no gain. FORT
MOULTRIE never far back throughout while racing widest through the stretch. PICO D'ORO rated just off leader to quarter pole, could not go on and faded.
NOTABLE EXCEPTION never factored. THE PREDICAMENT tracked inside to far turn, gave way readily. BAKWENA widest first turn and never factored
thereafter. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN OF THE TOP FOUR FINISHERS WITH THE OUTCOME STAYING AS IS
AFTER REVIEWING THE FILM.

SPRITZ speed to the front, pressured to stretch, dug in gamely to stay the wire. SUNDIAL checked hard first turn, dropped back, rallied along late and
coming on in a good effort. POLKA POLENTA dueled inside to quarter pole, weakened in the stretch run. TREASURE LANE bumped start. raced back to
far turn with a mild late run. NURTURING close up throughout, raced evenly with a light steady in the lane. HOW LUCKY raced back throughout with no late
run when needed. TULLY'S HOPE never factored. PLENTY AWESOME always outrun. MISTY VEIL had a steady fade. HULDA trouble start, bad step first
turn, good position, gave way. PIONEER'S CANDY raced close to the action to far turn, surrendered from there. ALICE JEWELL up close to the half,
backed off and dropped back steadily.THE RIDER OF NURTURING CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST SPRITZ FOR TROUBLE IN THE STRETCH RUN THAT
WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS AND FINISH STAYED AS IS.

evenly with no late kick when needed in the stretch. PLEDGE never factored. JUST READ IT stayed within striking distance to stretch with nothing left and
faded. DIRTY DANGLE was through at the half and dropped back. LICHITA never a real factor. DEVIL'S ADVOCATE was through early from ouside and
