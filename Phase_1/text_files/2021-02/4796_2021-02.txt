NOSTALGIA tracked, pressed pace three wide with a slow late gain to prevail late. AUNTIE MABEL good speed to set a pressured pace to deep stretch,
tried hard but run down late. QUEEN LOUISE raced evenly from inside with no late gain on rail in the stretch. TELLER TO SING unhurried early, outside run
into far turn to move up in the late going. LASKA never a factor, only passed tired ones late. CONSOLING had an awkward start, never untracked from the
far turn. MOLLYS MELODIE close up to far turn, moved outside into stretch but dropped back. NOBLE FEVER speed between horses backstretch but
through at the half. TRADITIONAL ARCHER was also through after the half and dropped back. DELANEY FERRY never a real menace.

UNTIL NOW quick from gate, set all pace under a tight hold and, drew off and cruised home handily in a powerful effort. VOLNAY no speed to turn, circled
field to rally for the place spot while clearly no match for the winner. PETTIGO GIRL unhurried to turn, came three wide past quarter pole and ran on late.
EVIE leaned on at the start, raced back to turn, came four wide past quarter pole and improved positon in the stretch run. ABHAILE never menaced
throughout. DOLLY MINGUN outside rush, could not keep up with leader while used up and faded back. STELLA MARS raced outside most of way while
never close. LOVE'S TAVITO broke outward at the start and bothered rival, chased from inside but was through early. SAMURAI FIGHTER never menaced.
EIDA'S STORM never close. BOOTS N' JEANS had an awkward start and through after a half. SILK SPECTRE chased to no avail outside to turn and
stopped to a walk in the stretch run.
