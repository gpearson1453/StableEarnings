NAT GIO was allowed to settle early, went three wide into the turn, angled out in early stretch, was closing late and was up in time for the win. ARIZONA
SUN was off slow, rushed to force the early pace, went four wide into the turn, took control at the quarter pole, drifted out through the turn, opened up,
couldn't hold off the winner, drifted out late and finished second best. WITHIN THE LAW pressed the early pace, went five wide through the turn and
weakened late. TOP HAT HIGH JINKS set a pressured early pace, raced six wide through the turn and faded. SIERRA SUMMER was void of any early
speed, went five wide and offered no rally.

Footnotes
DANSMETOTHENDOFLOV was void of any early speed, loomed eight wide through the turn, made a bid at the quarter pole, dueled with SHESA
GOLDIGGER to the wire and prevailed for the win. SHESA GOLDIGGER was outrun early, ranged up seven wide, took a brief lead, met the bid of the
winner, dueled to late stretch and just missed. SLEIGH RIDE raced in mid pack early, advanced between rivals into the turn, angled out and offered a mild
late rally. MY EXPRESSION set a pressured early pace, went four wide and weakened late. PROUD CAT was allowed to settle early, raced six wide and
offered no late rally. INVODKAWETRUST pressed the early pace, went four wide into the turn and faded. ME FIRST stalked from off the rail and flattened
out. BLUEGRASS BETTY was unhurried early, circled nine wide through the turn and never fired.
