Footnotes
ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE tracked the early pace, made a middle move along the backstretch, took control at the three eights pole and drew off as an easy
winner. G M GAGE was unhurried early, raced six wide into the second turn, angled out in mid stretch, was gaining late, was no match and finished second
best. RACING RAY raced in mid pack early, went four wide into the second turn, drifted out late and held third. MCTHANKS was void of any early speed,
raced between rivals into the second turn, angled in and finished evenly. EMPIRE RULER was reserved early, advanced seven wide into the second turn
and offered no late rally. EYE OF THE HUNTER was taken back early, went five wide into the second turn and never fired. MR VIEW was outrun early,
circled eight wide through the second turn, drifted in and was no factor. PARTY FOR ONE was allowed to settle from the inside and flattened out. GENOA
BAY was up close early, went three wide into the second turn and was finished early.
