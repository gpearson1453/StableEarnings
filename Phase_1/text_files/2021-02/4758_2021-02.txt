Footnotes
TWIN BRIDGES dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, shook clear approaching the furlong marker, and held sway to the wire while tiring a bit. GAGA
OH LA LA prompted the pace three wide, inched closer turning for home to vie outside of TWIN BRIDGES in upper stretch, but was turned away by that
rival at the furlong pole, then kept on after flopping back to his left lead late. PIPER vied two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with them
passing the quarter pole, shifted outside of those foes in upper stretch, and kept on. KHOZAN'S SECRET broke outwardly and bumped an outer foe at the
start, tracked the leading trio from many lengths off while along the inside, then failed to make an impact. MIRACULOUS was last away and off awkwardly
after splaying out her front right to regain balance at the start, lied far off of the pace two wide around the turn, and failed to factor. ECLIPTICALS CAROL
lunged inwards and bumped an inner rival at the start, lied far off of the pace along the inside, and never got involved. HELLO PRINCESS took significant
bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, and was outrun.

Footnotes
SAY CHEESE became edgy in the gate prior to the start, came away in good order and raced in closest attendance to KIRBY early, took over outside that
one approaching the quarter-pole and moved clear under a drive. GREENWOOD DRIVE broke out hitting the gate and bumping PANDORICA, shifted out
four wide leaving the turn, and rallied mildly outside rivals for the place. KIRBY set the pace inside, yielded to the winner soon after going a half-mile, and
lost the place late. SHAKEM was outrun early, bumped with PRETTY LIDDIE leaving the eighth-pole, and could not threaten. PRETTY LIDDIE broke slowly,
bumped with SHAKEM entering the final furlong, and made no headway. PANDORICA was bumped by GREENWOOD DRIVE at the start, and trailed.

Footnotes
ASSUME CONTROL set the pace along the inside from a pair of foes, turned away LET'S BE HONEST's mild bid and shook clear passing the three
sixteenths pole, then held sway to the wire. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader at the five sixteenths
pole, kept on to regain place from an outer foe passing the furlong grounds, then chased the leader home. SHE TAKES HEART saved ground off of the
pace, then stayed on to claim a minor share. ETANA trailed along the inside, swung four to five wide in upper stretch, and improved without threatening.
LET'S BE HONEST stalked three wide, inched closer to the leader turning for home, but was turned away passing the three sixteenths marker, and
weakened thereafter. GRACE'S DRAMA lied off of the pace in the three to two path around the turn, and failed to factor. DONT GET SMART tracked from
midpack two wide leaving the chute, but was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
JOSHY JAK received a bump from PALEMMA at the break, recovered to midpack early, continued to progress four wide around the turn, challenged
outside SCRAPPY ARTIE and TWICE TOO MANY at the top of the stretch, and prevailed over the latter after a long drive. TWICE TOO MANY pressed the
early pace outside, vied between SCRAPPY ARTIE and JOSHY JAK turning for home, and fought gamely inside the latter to the finish. SCRAPPY ARTIE
hustled up after the start to grab the lead inside a trio of opponents, faced a two-pronged challenge after a half-mile, and yielded past the eighth-pole.
PROUD CONTENDER moved in from the two-path making a run along the rail entering the stretch, but could not sustain the rally. MAJESTIC STREET
stayed in range for a half, then faded approaching the stretch while shifting out four wide. BACKCHAT was no factor three wide. SOUL DANCER pressed
the pace three wide between horses, and gave way five-sixteenths out. PALEMMA broke in bumping JOSHY JAK at the start, and was always outrun.
HARRYKEEPTHECHANGE vied early between rivals, moved in dropping back on the turn, and faltered.

Footnotes
FAST CATALINA prompted the pace two wide, vied turning for home, drew clear approaching the furlong grounds, and held sway. GLORIOUS GAL stalked
along the inside, shifted outside of the leading duo in upper stretch while inside of SHIKAKA, forged place passing the furlong grounds from between
horses, and held that position from the aforementioned foe to the wire. SHIKAKA lied forwardly placed three wide, got floated four wide by GLORIOUS GAL
in upper stretch, chased while hanging on her left lead through the lane, and hung for place. GET N TIPSY tracked from midpack along the inside, took the
turn in the two path before swinging five wide in upper stretch, but drifted out slightly in midstretch, and only produced a mild kick to narrow the margin. K'S
RUNNING FREE was off a step slowly, lied off of the pace in the two path around the turn, and failed to mount a rally. ZIP IT JESS set the pace inside of the
eventual winner, but was headed by that foe passing the three sixteenths pole, and weakened through the final furlong. NOBLE MARIA trailed the field in
the three path around the turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
UNA LUNA was unhurried early, advanced three to four wide after six furlongs, exchanged brushes and bumps with SHORT POUR and VITAEMI while
battling between those two through a heated drive, and proved best near the finish. VITAEMI settled well off the early pace, reached contention four then
five wide approaching the stretch, exchanged brushes and bumps outside UNA LUNA through the stretch and just missed. SHORT POUR went along in the
middle of the field for a half-mile, took closer order two then three wide after six furlongs, moved in vying for command inside VITAEMI and UNA LUNA,
exchanged brushes and bumps with the latter and took up in tight quarters on the rail late. CODRINGTON saved ground for six furlongs, moved to the
two-path for the drive and lacked a closing bid. JOSEFA tracked the early leaders, lodged a bid two wide on the far turn, but gave way into the stretch.
JABUTICABA set the pace inside, and folded up leaving the quarter-pole. KATIELEIGH pressed the early pace, was empty under heavy pressure by
midway on the far turn, steadied being overrun from both sides near the quarter-pole, and jogged in. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE
STRETCH RUN BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
GITANA set the pace along the inside, drew clear in upper stretch, and was ridden out to the wire. LORILOUPIES stalked three wide, bid outside of GITANA
at the quarter pole, but was repelled in upper stretch, and proved second best. DAHLONEGA pressed two wide, chased the leaders turning for home as
LORILOUPIES made an outside bid, but failed to keep pace with them in upper stretch. MIDTOWN ROSE trailed along the inside, improved two wide
turning for home, but failed to reach contention. BEAN broke a step slowly, lied far off of the pace along the inside, and failed to factor. SALSA RITA lied off
of the pace while taking the turn in the four path, and tired.

Footnotes
LA LIBERTEE saved ground in the middle of the field entering the turn, began moving off the inside coming to the quarter-pole, came four wide rallying into
the stretch, kicked in while swapping leads several times and forged ahead outside rivals late. AMALFI PRINCESS saved ground throughout, loomed along
the rail through the furlong grounds and finished gamely. REINAGOL vied outside TURN IT ON for three-eighths of a mile, edged away in upper stretch, but
was overhauled from both sides through the closing stages. QUEEN ARELLA stayed close early inside, moved out to the three-path turning for home, and
was outfinished. AGOG was outrun to the stretch, and improved position without becoming a factor. CAN'T BUY LOVE was outsprinted two wide for three
furlongs, and passed only tired horses. DANESSA BABY broke slowest, chased three then four wide around the turn, and had no final response. TURN IT
ON dueled for the lead inside REINAGOL to the stretch, and weakened. DIAL TO WIN was no factor four wide. LAMBEAU LADY was no factor three wide.

Footnotes
ITALIAN TWIN lied off of the pace two wide, advance to a midpack three wide position into the far turn, shifted five wide turning for home, and sustained her
rally to drive past the leader at the sixteenth grounds before holding sway from IRAZU late. IRAZU saved ground at the rear of the field, shifted four wide
turning for home, waited behind traffic through upper stretch before splitting foes at the furlong grounds, bumped MA REVE in the process, surged to bid
approaching the wire, but was denied by the leader. FRANKIE'S GIRL saved ground far off of the pace, slipped inside of ESTELLINA at the quarter pole
while bumping that foe in the process, rallied along the rail to bid for the lead at the sixteenth pole, but was outkicked by a pair of outer foes in the late
stages. TIME SENSITIVE stalked two wide, vied between horses around the far turn, forged an advantage in upper stretch, drew clear briefly in midstretch,
but failed to fend off a trio of rallying rival at the sixteenth pole. BLUE EYE KITTEN lied far off of the pace three to four wide around the turns, swung six
wide into the lane, and stayed on. MOTHERS DAY JEWEL lied off of the pace along the inside, faded to the rear of the field two wide around the far turn,
shifted seven wide approaching the furlong grounds, and improved late. MISS AMENDMENT tracked from midpack three wide, advanced to a stalking
position into the far turn, inched ahead to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but flattened out while shifting four wide in upper stretch, and faded thereafter.
BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY trailed the field two wide early on, swung to the eight to nine path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. ESTELLINA tracked from
midpack along the inside, advanced to be behind the leading trio into the far turn, but was bumped by FRANKIE'S GIRL to her inside passing the quarter
pole, then faded in upper stretch. ALEXANDRA AM I set the pace along the inside, held a narrow margin from a pair of foes around the far turn, yielded to
those rivals entering the lane, then drifted out in midstretch into MA REVE's path while weakening. MA REVE stalked along the inside, vacated the rail down
the backstretch, lacked a splitting kick in upper stretch, but was bumped by an outer rival approaching the furlong pole, got shut off by an inner drifting foe
passing that marker, steadied due to the incident, and weakened thereafter. VIVA lied far off of the pace two wide, and was outrun.
