Footnotes
ASHLEY'S NEW SHOES stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up around the final turn, pulled away and won handily. SILENT TRICK lacked early
speed, moved up wide around the second turn, made a wide bid and got up for second. VIVA CAT raced within striking distance, made a late try and was
caught for second. JOE G'S PAYBACK went to the front, saved ground, raced close throughout and lacked a late kick. ZUGERSEE raced in the middle of
the pack and put forth an even effort. TWN PALMYSDESTINY raced near the back, came around the first turn wide and was never a factor. SUPER LEGS
void of early speed and was outrun. SEASIDE SURPRISE raced near the middle of the field in the beginning, saved ground around the final turn, faded and
was no threat late. SHREW GRIT dueled for the early advantage and dropped back.

Footnotes
THAT'S D 'CAT dueled for the early lead, saved ground and drove clear before the wire. BAJAN CASH raced within striking distance, behind the leaders
down the backside, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a bid, but couldn't match strides with the winner. HARDLY SEEN SLIM lacked
early speed, saved ground, proved no match for the top two, but got by MOMENT for third. MOMENT pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and
got caught for the show. GONE PREACHIN lacked early speed, raced wide around the final turn, made a mild bid and finished evenly. EIGHTS WILD raced
outside around the first turn, lacked early speed and was never a threat. DREWSIZZLE raced within contention, saved ground and faded. INTIMIDATING
void of early speed and showed little.
