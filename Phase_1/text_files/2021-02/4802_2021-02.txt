Footnotes
TELLINGTON saved ground outrun early, circled five wide coming off the far turn, rallied steadily and was up outside LANDBISCUIT in the closing strides.
LANDBISCUIT was outrun early inside, rallied around the far turn four then five wide, reached the front in mid stretch and edged clear, but was nailed
nearing the finish. POLITICAL RIOT was slow into stride, steadied early on the far turn, and found his best stride belatedly. LIGHTNING ROD was forced
out by KATHERN'S JOY at the start, settled in the middle of the field for six furlongs, and finished evenly. MACHO REAL vied outside KATHERN'S JOY to
upper stretch, and weakened through the final furlong. KATHERN'S JOY broke outward, contested the pace inside MACHO REAL to the stretch, and
weakened. ARROWHEART was no factor in the second flight throughout. MR. EINSTEIN failed to make headway inside. JARLIAN tired inside after six
furlongs. PACIFIC LEGEND raced close up three wide, bid on the far turn, but gave way into the lane. EYE OF HORUS raced three to four wide throughout,
and tired after a half-mile. MAXI MOON lost contact with the field before reaching the stretch, and jogged in. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
LUANN settled far off of the pace along the inside, shifted two wide turning for home, rallied inside of the leader to drive past that foe at the sixteenth pole,
and drew clear thereafter. COOKIE COVE set the pace outside of a pair of rivals early on, cleared those foes into the turn, maintained a clear margin while
staying in the two to three path around the bend, held an advantage passing the furlong pole, but had little resistance for an inner rallying rival at the
sixteenth pole, then just held place at the wire. HOLD THE APPLAUSE was off a step slowly, recovered to midpack, gained four wide into the turn to chase
the clear leader turning for home, bid outside of that foe passing the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an inner rallying rival, and missed reaching place
on the wire. ILL WILL lied far off of the pace in the five path around the turn, then sustained chasing position through the lane. DANCING DESTROYER vied
along the inside early on, stalked the clear leader into the turn while shifting to the two path, and failed to produce a bid. FREEZER BURN took the turn in
the two to three path while far off of the pace, swung six wide turning for home, and failed to factor. JUST SMOK'N vied between horses early on, stalked
the clear leader into the turn, then from between horses in the three path around the bend, but faded through the lane. MISS OVER THERE tracked from
midpack early on, faded in the two path around the turn, but was done early.

AMERICAN PRINCE sprinted to the front staking out the two-path, shook off NACO turning for home and was never in jeopardy. HARVARD moved off the
inside approaching the quarter-pole, and ran on willingly to best the others. NACO pressed AMERICAN PRINCE from outside for a half-mile, got shaken off
into the stretch, and raced greenly through the lane on his left lead. DUPUIS was no threat three to four wide. PUBLICLY AVAILABLE brushed with
CORRADO at the start and was a half-step slow coming out, got ridden along three wide midway on the turn, and made no progress. CORRADO brushed
with PUBLICLY AVAILABLE at the break and was slowest to begin, and was outrun inside. FULL CHARGE was outrun two wide.

Footnotes
ZIA'S SONG prompted the pace setter from the outside, bid for the lead turning for home, forged an advantage while shifting to the three path in upper
stretch, and drew clear through the final furlong. CANDY JAR stalked two wide and from between horses, then stayed on through the lane to reach the early
pace setter for place at the sixteenth pole, but failed to threaten the leader. IN VAIN was sent early on to set the pace along the inside, met the winner's bid
turning for home, got headed by that foe in upper stretch, then gave way through the final furlong, but held show. FIRST HOUR chased along the inside, but
failed to produce a bid while drifting out through the final furlong, and missed catching the tiring early pace setter for show. TREVISE saved ground far off of
the pace, shifted to three path turning for home, and improved position without threatening. NEVER AT ALL (FR) lied off of the pace two wide, shifted to the
four path in upper stretch, floated to the five path to stay outside of FIRST HOUR through midstretch, and failed to factor. SPILL THE TEA saved ground off
of the pace, but to no avail. ACTUALLY trailed the field by a margin while staying in the three path around the turn, swung to the six path turning for home,
and never got involved. BLACK SWAN lied forwardly placed three wide, but faded at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
GLORY OF FLORIDA advanced three wide around the turn, rallied to the lead outside CREATE AGAIN with a furlong remaining and edged away, then held
QUENANE safe late. QUENANE raced two wide around the turn, moved out through the furlong grounds and finished with belated energy outside the
winner. CREATE AGAIN pressed the pace outside MAX K. O., challenged approaching the quarter-pole, vied up front through upper stretch, then weakened
inside the top two. BLESSED JOURNEY raced two then three wide around the turn, and could not gain through the stretch on his left lead. MAX K. O. set
the pace inside, and gave way to challengers with a furlong remaining. DANVILLE trailed for six furlongs, and never reached contention. FORT PECK
stayed in range early, and weakened before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
CELLIST vied outside of SPOTTERS HILL (IRE) while allowing that foe to show the way, inched closer around the far turn to spark a duel turning for home,
battled through midstretch while forging a narrow advantage, then edged away from that rival in the final sixteenth. SPOTTERS HILL (IRE) set the pace
while feeling pressure from CELLIST off of his outer flank dug in turning for home as that foe produced bid, dueled through midstretch, but was bested at the
sixteenth marker, gave way late, and just held place. SOUTHERN DISTRICT saved ground from midpack, smoothly shifted three wide in upper stretch to
pursue the dueling leaders, then chased those foes well through the lane while narrowing their margin, but missed reaching the early pace setter for place.
CAMBI LION tracked from midpack two to three wide around the turns, got floated four wide turning for home, then five wide in upper stretch, but was
outkicked by SOUTHERN DISTRICT in midstretch for minor rewards, chased thereafter, and just held fourth from an inner rallying rival. AVENUE leaned
inwards and bumped the gate, then an inner foe at the start, rated far off of the pace two wide around the turns, then stayed on well to gain ground between
horses through the lane, but missed a minor placing. FEEDING FRENZY stalked along the inside, but came under driving pressure into the far turn,
sustained chasing position in upper stretch, but faded through the final furlong. WARN lied off of the pace two to three wide around the turns, shifted six
wide turning for home, but lacked a rally. GINSBURNED was bumped by an outer foe into an inner foe at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but to
no avail. CARROBIO trailed the field, took the far turn three wide before swinging seven wide in upper stretch, but made little impact. STATEN ISLAND
stalked two wide, but was outkicked by an inner foe and an outer rival in upper stretch, and subsequently weakened. AGENT CREED was off slowly and
bumped by an outer foe at the start, then saved ground at the rear of the field, and was outrun.

Footnotes
CHILL HAZE sped clear early and moved inside, repelled a bid from COOL HAND COOP after a half-mile, stayed on his left lead through the stretch and
widened under constant pressure. TONS OF GOLD broke slowly and lagged well back early, swung widest for the drive and was up late for second.
PURECRAZIDUDE raced two wide on the turn, moved inside advancing into the stretch, then finished evenly. COOL HAND COOP chased outside the
winner, lodged a mild bid on the turn, then weakened. MEMORABLE broke slowly, moved up around the turn two then three wide, but flattened out. BABY
BROTHER chased the leaders three wide for a half, and faded. SAINT LARNED broke slowly and was outrun four wide. SENZAZIONE was never
prominent. IT'S A RISK was finished early inside. MIDNIGHT WHISKEY raced close up inside for a half, and faltered.

Footnotes
AVIANO lied far off of the pace along the inside, gained ground in the two path around the far turn, advanced to be behind the leading group in upper
stretch, altered outside of those rivals passing the furlong pole, bumped HE'SPUREGOLD and caused that rival to be steadied in the process, then split the
leaders late while inside of ALEXANDGER VALLEY, and bumped that foe multiple times approaching the wire while prevailing. ALEXANDER VALLEY
stalked two wide and between horses, got floated five wide in upper stretch, rallied outside of foes through the lane, produced a bid in the final furlong as
AVIANO shifted outwards to do the same, then got bumped multiple times approaching the wire by that foe while getting outfinished. PREGAME prompted
the pace two wide, vied between horses around the far turn, dueled inside of MY SEA COTTAGE (IRE) through the lane, but came out and bumped that foe
inside the final sixteenth while getting outkicked by a pair of outer rivals. MY SEA COTTAGE (IRE) lied forwardly placed while caught four wide around the
first turn, inched closer to vie for the lead three wide around the far turn, dueled outside of PREGAME through the lane, but was bumped by that foe in the
late stages, and simultaneously outkicked by outer rivals. ADVANCED PLACEMENT saved ground off of the pace, then stayed on well inside of the leaders
late. HE'SPUREGOLD stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading trio in upper stretch, but was bumped in pinched by AVIANO when that foe
shifted outwards passing the furlong pole, steadied due to the incident, and was protected thereafter. MEGAYACHT lied forwardly placed three wide and
between horses, but came under coaxing while losing position at the half mile pole, and failed to factor thereafter. STRAIGHT UP GUY set the pace along
the inside, then inside of a pair of rivals around the far turn, but gave way to them in upper stretch, and subsequently weakened. GREY STREAK hesitated
at the start and was last away, trailed in the two path around the first turn, then lied at the rear of the field between horses around the far turn, and never got
involved. POTUS lied far off of the pace two to three wide, and never got involved. RUN UP DISTANCE IS UNAVAILABLE

Footnotes
SONAR raced close up three wide to the stretch, challenged outside CORY GAL through mid stretch, and forged past into the last sixteenth of a mile.
CORY GAL sprinted clear early, showed the way a bit off the rail to the stretch, stayed on her left lead and yielded grudgingly late. SOUND MACHINE
trailed in a closely-knit group entering the turn, swung four wide for the drive, had aim outside the leaders but did not have enough. EVE OF WAR saved
ground throughout, came under a ride midway on the turn, and lacked the needed response. STILL ALIVE stayed close two wide into the turn, was under a
busy ride past the three-eighths, and was empty in the stretch while widest.

Footnotes
GHOSTLY BEAUTY brushed the gate at the start, lied far off of the pace, shifted off of the rail around the far turn before swinging six wide into the lane,
then rallied outside of foes to bid at the sixteenth pole, and drove clear. FREDDYMO FACTOR saved ground off of the pace while under a snug hold around
the first turn, shifted two wide in upper stretch, split foes at the furlong marker, and achieved place late. STORMY DERBY DAY lied off of the pace two wide,
then four wide around the far turn before being floated five wide in upper stretch, sustained a bid between horses at the sixteenth pole, but was outkicked by
an outer foe at that marker, then got outfinished by an inner rival for place. SMACK prompted the pace two wide, bid around the far turn, forged an
advantage in upper stretch before drifting to the four path at the furlong grounds, then was swallowed up between horses at the sixteenth pole.
HURRICANE BREEZE stalked along the inside, shifted three wide in upper stretch, but lacked a kick to split foes at the furlong pole while under light urging,
got outkicked by an inner foe passing that marker, and failed to menace. I'LL DO IT MY WAY stalked three wide, but was outkicked by rival on both sides
while floated four wide in upper stretch, and faded. MAJIC FLASH set the pace along the inside, met SMACK's bid around the far turn, got headed by that
foe in upper stretch, then weakened through the final furlong. SPIN YOUR PARTNER stalked two wide while under a hard hold around the first turn, and
steadily faded thereafter. PHILLY SPECIAL was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
PSYCHIC ABILITY was outrun for a half-mile, began to pick it up turning for home while widest of all, kicked in past the eighth-pole and wore down NO
DECAF in time. NO DECAF broke alertly despite veering out several paths, set the pace removed from the rail, shook off pursuers from both flanks in upper
stretch while staying on her left lead, switched leads very late while drifting out, and could not hold off the winner. JADE EMPRESS raced three wide around
the turn, and lacked a solid closing response while up for the show outside. DEM A WONDER pressed the pace inside, and weakened through the last
eighth of a mile. MON PETIT CHOU bid three wide after a half-mile, stayed on to the furlong grounds and gave way. THINK IT THRU stayed close to the
turn near the inside, and was through after a half. STARSHIP NANA was outrun inside. BIG RINGS showed brief speed, and faltered around the turn.

in midstretch, and stayed on well to chased the leading duo home. ZAFFING stalked three wide, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but faltered in
midstretch. FOXTROT SEVILLE vied along the inside, but gave way to outer foes passing the furlong pole, and faded on her left lead. EXCEPT

between horses, shifted four wide turning for home, but lacked a closing kick. DREAMING OF AUDREY lied off of the pace in the three path around the first
