Footnotes
COULTHARD (IRE) forced in by EAGLE CHIEF at the start then steadied twice on the backstretch, settled off the pace, went two wide into the turn then
swung four wide into the drive, drifted inward in the stretch and drew clear in the final sixteenth. FIRST CLASS DAD set the pace early and crossed over to
the inside, got some pressure around the turn and cleared again into the stretch, clung to a short lead at the eighth pole, could not fend off the winner but
stayed on well for second. EAGLE CHIEF came in soon after the start, stalked the pace from inside, tipped out at the top of the lane, bid between foes with
a furlong to go but could not sustain the needed momentum and held the show. NO FOOLERY HERE raced along the inside through the turn, shifted out
into the stretch, bumped foe at the top of the lane, finished well and missed the show. MAHAAMEL (IRE) broke in and bumped rival, angled to the inside out
of striking distance, moved out into the two path around the bend, came out at the top of the stretch and kept on. HUDSON RIDGE closest in pursuit early
just outside the leader, applied pressure around the turn, lost contact into the lane and weakened. GOT CURLY raced in a bit tight early then steadied soon
after, tracked two then three wide around the turn, got bumped from inside and checked in uppper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. KAHUNA
MAGIC knocked into rival leaving the gate, raced greenly early before settling into the stride, trailed two wide to the stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
LADY MYSTIFY quickly established the front, controlled the pace early, kicked clear around the far turn, then widened under hand urging and was ridden
out late. AMERICAN HEIGHTS pulled behind the leader from the rail on the first turn, stalked inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch, shifted into the two
path chasing LADY MYSTIFY around the final bend, could not make an impact on the winner in the late stages but was clearly second best. QUICK AND
DIRTY broke out, stalked three deep then four wide into the stretch while outside DONNA BELLA and weakened. DONNA BELLA broke cleanly but was a
bit slow to get going, went to up to chase the speed between foes, coaxed along at the halfway point, lost ground through the second bend, tired in the
drive, was eased late and walked off.

Footnotes
SENSEMAKER away quickly from outside, had early speed then stalked outside the leader, took aim three wide into the stretch, grabbed the lead nearing
the eighth pole and drew away. DANIEL'S MAGIC stalked the pace from inside, saved ground into the lane, got bumped in upper stretch, lacked room
mid-stretch then shifted out and finished well for the place. PRO BONO got crowded and checked at the start, closed into striking distance up the
backstretch, steadied at the three-eighths pole then shifted out into the two path, was floated a bit by the runner-up in mid-stretch and got up for the show.
IMISSBAYMEADOWS sped to the front and angled to the inside, led two wide into the drive, bumped rival in upper stretch, was overtaken with a furlong to
go, drifted to the rail and flattened in the final sixteenth. MONGOLIAN FORD settled off the rail, went four then three wide around the turn and finished
willingly. SPECIAL MISSION tracked off the rail then angled in and went between foes, got pinballed nearing the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch
and kept on through the final furlong. CROSS INDIAN tracked from inside, drifted out and bumped rival nearing the quarter pole, remained inside to the
stretch then came off the rail and lacked a rally. RACING ACE chased three wide into the turn, got bumped near the quarter pole and weakened in the lane.
SOULONG traveled near the back of the pack while outside a rival, went two wide into the turn, angled four wide around the bend and never rallied.
WHISKEY VISION was at the rear of the field up the backstretch and moved to the inside, altered out behind troubled rivals at the quarter pole and had
nothing left for the drive. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INVOLVING TWO SEPARATE INCIDENTS. THE STEWARDS FIRST REVIEWED THE
INCIDENT INVOLVING CROSS INDIAN NEARING THE QUARTER POLE AND RULED THAT HE CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS BY DRIFTING OUT
AND BUMPING SPECIAL MISSION AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE. THE SECOND INCIDENT INVOLVED IMISSBAYMEADOWS AND DANIEL'S
MAGIC AND THE STEWARDS RULED THAT DANIEL'S MAGIC TRIED TO RALLY ALONG THE INSIDE WITHOUT A SUFFICIENT OPENING AND
THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
LADY TIMMY HO (IRE) tucked inside on the first turn, stalked along the rail then two wide into the stretch, drew alongside the leader and took command at
the eighth pole and drew clear late. WIND AND HOPE sped to the front from inside, showed the way unchallenged to the stretch, challenged from outside
and relinquished the lead at the eighth pole but stayed on well for the place. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU traveled mid-pack early, between foes into the far turn,
angled to the rail leaving that bend, finished willingly from inside and held the show. WITCH MOON angled in early, trailed to the far turn, swung five wide
into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and missed the show. LADY CROCKER settled near the rail, saved ground off the pace then angled out at the top of
the lane and lacked further response. SWEET DEVIL tracked off the rail, went three deep into the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and never rallied.
PHOENIX TEARS traveled three deep on the first turn then raced outside a rival on the backstretch, went two then three wide around the far turn and
weakened. EYES OPEN was closest to the leader early, coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, started to weaken leaving the final bend and faded.

MULTIPLIER stalked the top trio in the beginning, closed in four wide into the far turn, went up outside the top pair and took over nearing the quarter pole,
lost command in upper stretch, battled with TWO THIRTY FIVE in the final furlong and dug in to edge the runner-up. TWO THIRTY FIVE stumbled a bit
leaving the gate, pressed between rivals then took the lead at the nine-sixteenths, held a short lead into the far turn, lost command near the quarter pole,
fought back from inside and regained command in upper stretch, battled through the final furlong and got outgamed in the closing moments. SELF TAUGHT
showed speed from inside, led early with a pair of rivals to the outside, lost command at the nine-sixteenths, continued as part of the pace then chased from
the leaders into the far turn. ITSTHATTIME went four then three wide around the first turn, attended the pace outside the top pair, pressed the leader into
the far turn, lost ground around that bend and faded.

EARLS ROCK (IRE) unhurried in the early going, advanced two wide then angled to the rail around the turn, rallied between runners at the eighth pole,
fought with BEER CAN MAN in the final furlong and prevailed. BEER CAN MAN stalked off the rail then outside a rival, took the turn three to four wide, bid
in upper stretch and challenged three deep at the eighth pole then outside of EARLS ROCK through the final furlong and could not summon the needed
final kick. MAC DADDY TOO pressed the pace from inside, cleared rival around the turn and led into the stretch, was overtaken at the eighth pole and kept
on to hold the show. HARLAN ESTATE traveled near the back of the pack, raced along the inside then two wide around the turn, came out in upper stretch
and showed a mild response to earn a minor award. SWORD ZORRO (IRE) off a bit slow to begin, trailed in the early going, went two wide around the bend
then came out and passed tired rivals. COMMANDER KHAI chased off the inside then went between rivals, traveled two wide then moved to the rail on the
turn, moved back out into the two path leaving the bend and weakened. WESTON was in range early from inside, steadied along the rail near the quarter
pole and could not rally in the drive. GATOR SHINING off a bit slow to begin, raced along the inside then two wide into the stretch, angled out in the lane
and never threatened. EXHALTING showed early speed and set the pace outside a rival, dueled into the turn, lost contact around the bend and gave way.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THE VIDEO WAS INCONCLUSIVE AS TO WHETER THERE WAS ANY INTERFERENCE
BETWEEN EARLS ROCK AND WESTON AROUND THE TURN AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
A J ROCK broke out and bumped rival, set the pace under pressure to the outside, cleared rival near the halfway point, drew away around the far turn, put
to right-handed urging in the drive and held safely. WILD ARCH stalked the pacesetter along the inside to the lane and closed the gap in the final furlong.
MOREAVINO raced off the pace between rivals then two to three wide into the stretch and bested the rest. HAUTE TIME bumped by the winner leaving the
gate, went four then three wide on clubhouse turn, entered the far turn two wide, entered the stretch a bit off the rail and kept on for a minor share. SPOKEN
WITH A KISS entered the first turn five wide then angled to the three path, remained off the rail up the backstretch, traveled four then two wide around the
final bend and never rallied. MY GIRL PEARL veered out leaving the gate, entered the first turn seven wide then gradually moved into the four path, went up
to pressure the leader on the backstretch, chased foe into the far turn and tired. MOJO MAMA traveled six wide into the first turn then came in a few paths,
chased widest up the backstretch, entered far turn six wide then angled into the three path around that bend and made no impact. SHEZ OUR ARCH went
five then four wide around the first turn, stayed off the inside and entered the far turn five wide, steered down to the two path and was never a factor.
TURKISH ANGEL steadied at the start, moved to the inside, saved ground into the drive and had nothing left.
