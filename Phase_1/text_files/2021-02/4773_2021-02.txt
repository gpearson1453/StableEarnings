Footnotes
CHARLOTTE LOUISE bumped by rival at the start, chased leaders in the three path, entered turn three wide, took most of the turn two wide, found a seam
entering the stretch and bid three wide, found best stride late to surge past rival in deep stretch. WARM IT UP vied between rivals on the backstretch,
entered turn in between rivals, brushed with rival entering the stretch, dueled with inside rival to the sixteenth, shook off rival but unable to hold off outside
closing rival late, pulled up early in the turn and vanned off. BABY BEAUTY broke out and bumped rival at the start, recovered quickly and sent to contest
pace along the inside, continued along the rail into the turn and into the stretch brushed with rival, dueled with leader into deep stretch and gave way late.
SOPRESCIOUS contested pace three wide on the backstretch, entered turn three wide and drifted out into the stretch, finished up one pace while losing
ground on leaders. HAPPIER TOGETHER reared as soon as the gate opened and lost all chance at the start, trailed throughout and never threatened.
