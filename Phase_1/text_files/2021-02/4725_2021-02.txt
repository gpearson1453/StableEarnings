DREAMMASTER bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, moved in to save ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved up while off the inside
midway down the backstretch, stalked the leading trio in the three then four path on the far turn, gained while floating seven wide into the stretch, took over
at the three-sixteenths, drifted out under a right-handed whip while edging clear in the stretch, swapped back to his inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole
then back to his proper lead late and prevailed. HERO OF THE HOUR went around the first turn in the three path then tracked the pace, took the lead
midway down the backstretch, was asked in the two path while inside of two foes on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, lost touch with the
winner into the final furlong and was outfinished while well clear for the place. TRIVISTA broke out and bumped with a foe, raced in the four path on the first
turn, was rated just off the pace between horses, made a bid midway down the backstretch, vied between horses under urging in the three path on the far
turn, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened but held the show. HUMPHREY went to the front, set the pace on the inside, lost the lead midway down
the backstretch, dropped back nearing the seven-sixteenths, was urged along while moving from the rail to the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into
upper stretch and tired. EKATERINOSLAV was caught in the six path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch,
vied in the four path while outside of two foes on the far turn and came up empty. AFLEET ROGER bumped with a rival at the start, went five wide on the
first turn, settled on the outside, raced four wide on the far turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. V MAN bumped with opponents
on both sides at the start then dropped to the rear, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged along in the two path on the far turn
and was no factor.

Footnotes
ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM bumped with a rival at the start, became keen under restraint early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace
under a tight hold, cruised to the lead in the three path on the far turn, moved clear outside the quarter-pole, responded well when set down in upper stretch
and held under vigorous urging. WAVE OF GOODNESS went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved in late on the backstretch, raced inside
early on the far turn then shifted three wide, was driven four wide into the stretch then lugged in briefly before being straightened by the rider, chased the
winner in the drive and was outfinished while just able to get the place. PRINCESA BLANCA raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled off the
pace, was guided around the far turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch then angled out, pursued the top two into the final sixteenth, drifted
out late and finished with good courage to just miss the place while clear for the show. VITA bumped with a rival at the start, went around the first turn in the
two path, settled towards the rear, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch, lugged in outside the furlong marker and
improved position. GAUZY was a bit keen when taken in hand early, went three wide on the first turn, settled outside on the backstretch, was carried out
near the seven-sixteenths then dropped in outside the three-eighths, was roused at that point then ridden along in the two path on the far turn, dropped to
the rail under a drive in upper stretch, chased the winner in the final furlong and was out-kicked. GIO'S LIL ANGEL broke out at the start, went five wide on
the first turn, settled towards the rear on the outside, was roused four wide on the far turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the whip, came five wide into the
stretch, was carried in outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. BET YOUR BANKROLL was last away then in tight between horses
after the start, angled in at the rear, saved ground on the turns and was no factor. SOMTHINGSCANDALOUS broke in at the start, moved up to take the
lead, set the pace on the inside, extended the advantage midway down the backstretch, lost the advantage while inside on the far turn and faded.
DIAMOND LILY went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back midway down the backstretch, lugged out near the
seven-sixteenths and into the far turn then was eased but walked off. (Rail at 8 Feet)

GLITTER TIME angled in while going to the front then went clear, raced inside on the turn, saw the lead diminish at the five-sixteenths, was asked outside
the quarter-pole, responded well when put to the whip in upper stretch, remained on her inside lead while drawing off into the final sixteenth, swapped to the
proper lead about forty yards from the wire and proved much the best. OMA LEE bumped with a foe just after the start, was rated off the pace, went around

under a drive in upper stretch, fought back to regain the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong urging. DOODLE TIME saved
ground on the first turn, was reserved on the inside, drafted inside on the far turn, turned into upper stretch behind the leading duo, forced his way out from

five-sixteenths, took the lead into upper stretch, came out a path nearing the furlong marker, lost the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened

Footnotes
CILLA took a few awkward strides midway down the backstretch then steadied briefly, moved out while roused shortly thereafter, went three wide under
some restraint on the turn, shifted six wide into upper stretch, rallied on the outside, took the lead into the final furlong, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole
and prevailed under good handling. HALF KOO KOO showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was
asked for her best in upper stretch, lost the lead under a drive into the final furlong, fought on well to the wire but missed while narrowly able to get the
place. THETRUTHISTHETRUTH bumped with a rival at the start, was rated just off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was asked at the
quarter-pole then chased under a drive in upper stretch, made a bid into the final furlong but was outfinished then just missed the place while clear for the
show. TAYLOR AVENUE chased the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground while falling further behind on the turn, showed renewed
interest in the final furlong and improved position for the last spot in the superfecta. CHELSEA BRIDGE bumped hard with a rival at the start then was taken
up, spotted the front a few lengths, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then moved further out around the
three-sixteenths and gained some but failed to menace. AMOREENA STAR was bumped soundly at the start and forced out, settled outside at the back
under some urging, moved from four to six wide on the turn then came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ENDURING PEACE was bumped
hard at the start then forced soundly into another foe, settled near the back, moved from three to five wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and
failed to respond. HALFGLAMOROUS broke out and bumped hard with a foe, chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn and came up
empty. CLEARLY SAILING pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
BAD BEAT BRIAN was hustled from the start, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch then angled further to the
outside, rallied into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. TAKAFUMI (BRZ) was reluctant to load, established a good position just off the pace,
chased in the two path on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, gained to take the lead just inside the furlong marker, led into the final
sixteenth but was caught while able to get the place. LAND MARK DEAL bumped with a rival after the start, settled off the pace, was taken in hand behind a
foe near the seven-sixteenths then dropped in, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then dropped back to the rail at the
three-sixteenths, chased under a drive into the final furlong and finished willingly to get the show. YANKEE SEVEN settled off the pace, went two to three
wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, held a good striking position into the final furlong but lacked the needed kick. SIR TRUEBADOUR was
hustled from the start, bumped with a rival early, set the pace under pressure to his outside, moved clear in the two path on the turn, was set down in upper
stretch, lost the lead just inside the furlong marker and was outfinished. BIARRITZ settled well back on the outside, went three wide on the turn, floated eight
wide into the stretch and improved position without threatening. MERLIN'S SONG settled on the outside, tugged at the bit leaving the backstretch, went four
then three wide on the turn, dropped to the two path into the stretch, waited while carried in at the three-sixteenths then moved out while roused and lacked
the needed response. PICASSO was urged along near the back, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, shifted out under a drive outside the
furlong marker and gained ground but failed to menace. HOMEBRED settled at the rear of the field, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and was no factor. A SONG FOR ARCH bumped with a rival early, tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn and came up
empty. DREAMING OF CARATS bumped with a rival after the start, bumped with foes on both sides early, was rated just off the pace then taken up into the
turn, went three to four wide on that bend, spun six wide into the stretch and capitulated. CAN IMAGINE bumped with an opponent after the start, pressed

Footnotes
WHOLESHACKSHIMMIES bumped with a rival after the start, settled off the pace, was urged five wide on the turn, advanced to make a bid in upper
stretch, battled with the runner-up into the final furlong then edged clear under steady handling. CUSTOM GULCH showed speed between horses then
chased the pace, went four wide on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, took the lead in upper stretch, lost the advanced into the final furlong
and was outfinished while well clear for the place. LANGFUHR'S ANGEL settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper
stretch and lacked the needed response while up for the show. PUZZLING PRIORITY was hustled to the lead, moved clear with a half-mile to run, went
around the turn in the two path, turned into the stretch under a drive, lost the lead before the three-sixteenths and tired. GALAXY STAR pressed the pace on
the inside of the leader, dropped back near the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch then moved out under a
drive and came up empty. GO MY JULIET settled well back in the field, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. LAUREL'S CRICKET was hustled from the start, settled on the inside, bumped with a rival midway down the backstretch then dropped back, went
around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. SONG OF PARADISE bumped with a rival after the start, bumped
with another foe midway down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and had nothing left. JULIA'S CHANCE dropped well behind while hard ridden,
went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor.
