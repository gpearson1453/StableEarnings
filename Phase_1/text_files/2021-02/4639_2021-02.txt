Footnotes
RICH IMAGE settled close to the early pace in the two and three paths, steadied in tight quarters leaving the five eighths pole then bid past the seven
sixteenths, raced in the four path of the far turn and dug in down the lane to take over later yards. MOLLY BOLTS raced off the early pace about the three
path, bid into the backstretch and rounded the far turn about the four or five path, closed steadily through the lane and took second the final stride. NOR
PER OURS settled off the pace in the three and four paths, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and challenged from the three eighths, dueled to even
terms two deep midway on the far turn, dug in to a slim, brief lead in deep stretch but flattened stride approaching the wire. FLICKER'S PRINCESS raced
with the early pace two deep, challenged toward the nine sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep into the backstretch, dueled from that point, but lugged
in under right hand urging past the sixteenth pole and flattened stride. BOTTLE COURAGE raced well off the pace saving early ground, bid into the
backstretch then eased out toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the six and seven paths and finished evenly; widest. CHERISH YOUR
DREAM saved ground off the pace then bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced close near the rail on the far turn but checked in tight at the rail off the
inside flank of the errant Flicker's Princess past the sixteenth pole. KATIE FALOONA raced with the pace inside, came under pressure toward the nine
sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, but faded approaching the five sixteenths. LWF DRIVE BYE GAL raced in the four path the first two turns
then faded past the seven sixteenths pole. After a Stewards inquiry, Flicker's Princess was disqualified to sixth place for lugging inward and into the path of
Cherish Your Dream past the sixteenth pole.

FINAL SAY settled off the earlier pace while saving ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and came through the far turn in the three path, angled four
wide into the stretch and dug in to get up the final strides. HYPOTHESIS came away sharply and rated a slim lead inside, raced under pressure leaving the
three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in with the advantage under steady stretch encouragement but was nipped in the
final strides. ANNAMATED MOON rated close off the rail, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and contested the far turn three wide, dug in under
steady stretch encouragement, but the duel was for third. FIBER AND EMILY tapered in to stalk two deep then challenged leaving the three eighths pole,
contested the far turn at a close disadvantage two deep while between horses, raced close in the upper stretch but was outfinished in the later duel for third.
MARTIN MAN raced well off the early pace in the three and four paths, entered the backstretch outside and showed little response. SIENTE EL VIENTO

Footnotes
WASJUANNOWPAUL settled back toward the rail the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole then angled four wide through the far turn, dug in
leaving the turn to take over later yards and was inching further ahead nearing the wire. ROCKET ROAD settled off the earlier pace in the three and four
paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole to take the nod midway on the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn but was caught later
yards and reluctantly relented. R BOY EVENS stalked the earlier pace two deep and moved to even terms at the nine sixteenths pole, dueled to a slim lead
toward the three eighths and contested the advantage to the middle of the far turn, gave up the nod at that point then flattened stride down the lane. THREE
TO THIRTEEN saved ground through the opening turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly down the lane.
STORMY LEO was hustled to the front nearing the three quarter pole then met at the nine sixteenths, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced
close at the rail through the far turn, but weakened into the lane. OWL RUN raced in the three path the first turn and settled off the pace, started a four wide
bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the six path then flattened stride. GOODBYESEEULATER rounded the opening turn about the five
path and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the seven path of the far turn and showed little more.
MACANAO rounded the opening turn about the five path and never factored. BAY HILL showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
BRIAN'S AVENUE rated close toward the inside the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and contested close two deep while between horses on the
far turn, took the lead past the eighth pole, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. VIPER raced well back from early contention about the three path the
first turn, bid into the backstretch and came through the far turn seven wide, dug in leaving the turn to get up for second later yards and was gaining on the
winner. ASTRO RIDER rounded the opening turn about the three path and raced toward the outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, came through the far turn six wide but flattened stride the final sixteenth. G MAN moved to the inside and rated a short lead inside, was met into the
backstretch, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms nearest the rail on the far turn, but was caught inside the eighth
pole and flattened stride the final sixteenth. SEIZE THE DAY rounded the opening turn in the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid toward
the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the six path and passed rivals in the lane. WIDGET FACTORY saved early ground then picked up the
chase toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn but flattened stride mid-stretch. EXECUTIVE RETREAT rated just off the pace in the
three and four paths, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced close four wide on the far turn but weakened toward mid-stretch. BIZ
NASTY raced well back saving ground and showed little response through the backstretch. COMPROMISO was never a factor. BOLD VALOR accelerated
to contention and angled in to stalk two deep, moved to even terms into the backstretch and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, continued the
challenge two deep on the far turn but dropped back midway through the turn and gave way in the lane.

and steadily drew off under vigorous handling. CASTLEFINN rated close toward the inside, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn at the rail, dug in under steady stretch encouragement and just lasted for second while flattening stride. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE rounded the
first turn about the four path while racing off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and finished evenly; just
missing second. GOOFY BOY saved ground off the pace then picked up the chase into the backstretch, eased to the seven path on the far turn and passed
rivals widest. CUBIC SOUND raced in the five path the first two turns and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, came
through the far turn about the three path then weakened. DESTINY'S CHARGE rated off the pace in the four path, picked up the chase from the seven

Footnotes
BOP MARLEY settled back in the four path the first turn and raced unhurried through most of the backstretch, started a bid into the far turn and raced five
wide through the turn, dug in for the lead later yards and ran clear under the wire. DOCTOR MCCOY stalked two deep the first turn then took the lead past
the half mile pole, came under pressure nearing the three eighths, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch
encouragement but was caught flattening stride late yards. GOLDEN APPEAL settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths
pole and raced four wide on the far turn, then dueled for third later yards. MORGAN COUNTY saved ground off the pace then challenged three wide nearing
the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn but flattened stride the final sixteenth. RIDING CLOUD NINE saved ground off the pace, bid
leaving the three eighths pole but raced hemmed in toward the rail on the far turn and was apprehensively ridden inside through the final sixteenth. LIL MR
MATT rounded the first turn in the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn,
but showed little more. ROCKET SOUND took the lead between horses approaching the three quarter pole and set the pace early on, was headed at the
half mile pole, gave chase from that point but faded through the backstretch.

horses on the turn, was steadily handled through the upper stretch then taken in hand the final sixteenth. RICHIE'S B L chased toward the inside, angled
five wide from the mid point of the turn and dug in down the lane to take second the final strides. R TAP chased the early pace outside and closed to a slim
brief lead four wide midway on the turn, but drifted into the stretch and was nipped from second the final strides. MISTER CARSON was hustled to a slim
early lead, gave up the advantage at the rail nearing the quarter pole, remained close through the turn but flattened stride leaving the eighth pole. WHAT
ABOUT SHORTY angled to the outside to give chase, raced in the six path of the turn and finished evenly. BROTHER SKYE pressured the early pace and
