Footnotes
MARQUEE THUNDER took command soon after the start, clear into the first turn just off the inside, continued to show the way while under restraint in the
two path up the backstretch and into the far turn, was not threatened in the drive while being kept to task late. DOWN HOME KITTEN broke out a bit and
back, lacked speed, advanced through the second turn toward the inside, angled out to be four wide into the stretch, extended drive for the place, proved
game for that position while not a threat to the winner. ROAR OF THE LION bothered slightly at the start to be off slowly, also lacked any early foot,
advanced behind the runner up into the lane, moved out widest and outside that rival for the drive, outkicked for the second spot. HAVE A PLAN settled off
the pace while toward the inside early, bit closer into the far turn, asked while three out to four wide into the stretch, went evenly through the lane in lacking
a closing punch. REVENIO moved out to be four wide in the first turn, chased the winner the middle half, tired while three wide into the lane. BAQUERO
FLIES within striking distance along the inside, came up empty for the drive. MAJESTIC JOHN'S settled early off the pace while three wide, retreated after
five furlons. LA PAQUITA chased the winner just off the rail, stopped along the inside far turn, fell far back, distanced after losing contact with the field,
jogged in.

Footnotes
KICKIN' KIRBY moved up closer along the inside late backstretch, was used to maintain rail position into the turn, vied through the bend while remaining
along the inside, shook clear when straightened for home, enough left to last. NEW DICE in the second flight off the inside, three wide turn, swung out to be
five wide into the lane, finished full of run to be rapidly getting to the winner in the closing strides. HANEY BOYS with the pace while three wide early,
continued to vie between horses through the turn, could not keep up with entrymate drive, caught late for the place. TOIL AND TROUBLE settled in mid
pack while inside the runner up, shifted out a bit for room when straightened for home, managed a mild close while remaining out in the strip. AXIS void of
speed, asked along late ijn the turn, improved position through traffic. THAT DUDE asked along early to keep up, shuffled back in a bit tight along the rail
into the turn, continued to save ground into the stretch, had little left for the drive. HARRY in some traffic just after the start, steadied to continue back,
moved out, four to five wide through the turn, flattened out in the drive. PAPA JIMMY pressed the pace while four wide, gave way in the drive. CONFESS
vied up front three wide and between rivals for a half, also faltered when the real running began at the head of the lane. COMERUNNINBOYS last away,
remained back and was never a threat. TRAIL DRIVER tired while racing four wide.

Footnotes
MANY SWEET TREATS asked early to advance and press the issue into the turn, got out a bit to be five wide into the lane, shook clear, remained clear to
the wire under steady handling. ZANSHOES behind the pace off the inside, three path through the turn, could do little with the winner in the drive, proved
determined for the place in the late going while drifting in a bit the final furlong. EURO ME back off the pace well out in the strip, continued wide into the turn,
five wide entering the stretch when moving closer, advdanced, bid for place, outkicked for that position while remaining well out in the strip. FIVE QUEENS
broke out, brushed, lacked speed, continued back turn, came three wide in some traffic into the lane, improved a bit without posing a serious threat.
FLORIDA BIRD squeezed back at start, trailed off the inside, floated out four wide into the lane, passed some tiring rivals while also not posing a serious
threat. JOY IN THE JOURNEY vied up front while between rivals for a half, weakened in the drive. WILLOW MOON broke sharp, prompted the pace in the
five path into the turn, six wide into the stretch, tired through the lane. MARY ALICE with the early pace while along the inside, fell back into the turn,
continued to retreat down the stretch. LUCKY ROAD flashed some early foot in the two path and stopped.

Footnotes
FLAMING outrun in the early going well out in the strip, circled up into contention while six wide into the lane, bothered slightly by the runner up nearing the
furlong ground, firm handling, just up in the final jump. JUST LIFE behind the leaders outside, advanced closer while five wide and inside the winner turning
for home, drifted out a bit to bother that one with just over a furlong remaining, led late from between horses, nipped in the late going. LIL RESPECT in the
second flight outside, closer four wide into lane, bid between rivals with less than a furlong remaining, bid inside the furlong grounds while between rivals,
outkicked in the late going. LYRICIST broke back, lacked speed, four wide into the lane, improved past the furlong marker with some belated interest,
continued with lesser interest in the late going to miss the show. O K BABY broke in, bumped with PERFECTIONTODETAIL, straightened to race in the
main body off the inside, asked along turn, lacked needed response. NAVY LADY with the pace along the inside after breaking in good order, shook off the
other speed to be clear when straightened for home, lugged out inside the furlong marker and then caved in to lose several positions. KIMMY dropped
inside soon after the start, saved ground through the turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing bid. B REWARDING off a step slow, lacked
speed, picked off some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. NEBRASKA RED off a step slow, failed to menace. TANGO CINCO vied up front for
three furlongs in the three path and began to give way. MISSY QUICK fell back, was never a factor. PERFECTIONTODETAIL bumped at the start,
recovered to help set the pace for almost four furlongs then stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
SUBIACO broke alertly, allowed pace to go, patiently handled inside, boxed in late in the final turn in the two path, dropped to the rail and slipped through an
opening turning for home under clever handling, quickly clear, kept to task. SOUTHERN CENTS within striking distance off the inside, ranged up closer on
the outside to challenge in the three path late in the final turn, drifted out in upper stretch, straightened, held the place while not a threat to the winner.
MALIBU MARLEE steadied toward the inside late in the first turn, fell back, steered out to be four to five wide when moving closer late in the turn, set down
for the drive, finished willingly to be getting to the runner up in the waning strides. FIRST EMPRESS away in good order, stalked the pace off the inside,
moved to challenge while between horses in the second turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. HENNY FLY worked way clear early toward the
inside, saved ground into the far turn when continuing to lead, got out a bit to allow the winner the inside exiting that bend, weakened when headed by that
same rival soon after. SANTA ANA WINDS broke back, came four wide into the stretch, managed little in the way of a closing kick. TONAL VISION settled
off the pace and the inside, four wide into the far turn, failed to muster a response when called on for the drive. ALL IN BRONSON last away, remained
back. INDAWIN staged a steady retreat.

Footnotes
COLD AS HELL forwardly placed up the backstretch on the outside, dueled through the turn while mostly in the two path, asked along into the lane, slight
drift, due in late to prevail in game fashion while between horses at the end. LONG TERM THINKING forwardly placed while along the inside, behind the
leaders in traffic late in the turn and into the stretch, briefly waited then split foes to challenge with a furlong remaining, firm handling, outkicked. SMACK
ATTACK broke sharply, fell back off the leaders into the turn, moved out, challenged on the outside past the furlong marker, brisk handling, hung in the late
going to miss. FIXATION last to leave, void of speed in trailing four over a half, swung out five wide exiting the turn, improved position while not a threat to
the top three. POWER BURST fell back after the start, continued to lack speed into the turn, passed some tiring rivals while also not a serious threat. ACE
GILFORD in some tight quarters late on the backstretch in some traffic, second group into the stretch, came up empty when clear for the drive. CATHOLIC
GUILT failed to menace while racing four wide. BATTLE HERO vied early, dueled up front closest to the inside, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
COAL TRUTH outrun in the early going outside, asked a bit and moved closer in the four path through the final turn, challenged on the outside entering the
stretch, quickly shook clear and was kept to steady pressure to the wire. RED AGAIN dueled up front closest to but not on the inside, continued to alternate
up front into and through the final turn, briefly lost whip upper stretch, quickly regained it, proved no match for the winner late while finishing gamely for the
place spot. BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS in the second flight toward the inside, continued to race behind the leaders in the second turn, got through a large
opening into the stretch, mild bid, not enough for the place. STOCK DEAL last away, lacked speed inside early, moved out, raced four wide through the
second turn, displayed some mild interest to be gaining late for the show. AQWAAM broke on top, dueled up front while outside the runner up, continued on
equal terms between that one and the winner into the stretch, faltered the final furlong. CASHANOVA remained back off the pace just off the inside, asked
along and crept slightly closer far turn, lacked a further bid. PICKFORD within striking distance off the inside, three wide through the second turn, weakened
in the drive.

Footnotes
MOJO MAN forwardly placed early toward the inside, patiently handled early in the turn, asked late in the bend while still toward the rail, eased out a bit then
challenged between rivals inside the furlong grounds, took over a sixteenth out and edged clear. FIRECROW broke sharp, cleared toward the inside, set the
pace, continued to show the way into the lane after turning back a rival late in the bend, responded when challenged with less than a furlong remained then
could not match strides in the late going. NUCLEAR OPTION prompted the pace off the inside, challenged the leader from the outside turning for home,
flattened out in the final furlong. GUEST SUITE broke out to be last away, fell back to lag, continued back through the turn, steered widest for the drive,
finished up willingly while too late. STRIKE THAT broke back, moved out to race three wide through the turn, lacked a closing response. GOLD STREET
was finished early, well back.

in the fInal turn, took over, drew clear under steady handling. C H JAY broke alertly, set a disputed pace early closest to the inside, continued to show the
way second turn, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, showed some good resolve to preserve the place. HAMAZING VISION lacked speed,
continued behind horses into the lane, remained in traffic until less than a furlong remained altered course to the outside and finished with good energy to be
gaining for the place. PRIVATE LAKE off a step slow, steadied in traffic first turn, moved out to be four wide in the stretch, moved a bit closer before
flattening out in the final sixteenth to lose the show. REEF'S DESTINY within striking distance while outside in the first turn, continued well out in the strip,
four wide through the second turn, came up empty for the drive. IMPLICATOR settled outside, three wide in the run up the backstretch, came up empty for
the drive. FIVE O ONE prompted the pace while just off the inside, tired in the drive. POP LIFE remained always back. WEAST HILL was five wide when
forcing the pace into the first turn, was finished before a half. SOUIXPER CHARGER vied early outside the runner up, chased that one onto the backstretch,
began a steady retreat, stopped after three quarters, distanced, jogged in.
