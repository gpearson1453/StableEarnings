Footnotes
COMEDIAN was bumped at the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was
roused at the quarter-pole, rallied towards the inside under the whip, took the lead just inside the furlong marker then came out a bit before being corrected
by the rider, was given one crack of a right-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole then drew away under a strong hand ride to the wire. JURISDICTION
was taken in hand on the initial straightaway then tugged at the bit while four wide on the first turn, settled more kindly while outside on the backstretch,
chased four wide on the far turn then was driven five wide into the stretch, made a bid inside the three-sixteenths, battled into the final furlong and proved no
match for the winner while able to get the place. KINETIC SWAGGER broke in and bumped with a foe, went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on
the outside, took the lead in the three path at the five-sixteenths, was given his cue at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, lost the advantage at the
furlong marker and weakened but held the show. POWER PLAYER was taken under restraint early, went three to four wide on the first turn, was reserved
on the outside, raced in the four path on the far turn, was asked in the five path into the stretch and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show.
DREAMMASTER went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, raced four wide on the far turn, was roused six wide into the stretch, drifted out
in the final furlong, finished towards the outside fence and failed to rally. HOLY SPIRIT bumped with a rival at the start, moved in early, saved ground on the
first turn, settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive inside the
three-sixteenths and came up empty. EKATERINOSLAV brushed with a foe at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace,
dropped form three to two wide on the far turn, angled out under a drive in upper stretch and also failed to rally. MOM SAID YES bumped with an opponent
at the start, moved in at the rear, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the back, went three then four wide on the far turn, floated eight wide into the
stretch, was carried to the outside fence in the final furlong and was no factor. COPPER FIDDLE brushed with a rival at the start, went to the front, set the
pace on the inside while in hand, was asked on the far turn then headed at the five-sixteenths and faded. (Rail at 26 Feet)

CAROLINE'S STORY brushed the inside rail early, settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch then made a
bid between horses at the three-sixteenths, held a short lead under a drive into the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. GHOSTING KIM settled
towards the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied outside to make a bid into the final furlong, fought with the
winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the place. DYNAMITE GIFT settled on the outside, moved in near the seven-sixteenths,
saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, steadied while lacking room outside the three-sixteenths marker, was asked inside that marker,
had a brief hole between horses nearing the eighth-pole but lacked the acceleration to go through, was urged behind horses without clearance in front in the
final furlong and earned the show. RUN COOKIE RUN showed good speed and contested the pace, vied in the two path on the turn, was put to a drive in
upper stretch, dropped back into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked then missed the show. JIM'S BRONZE STAR broke out at the start, showed speed
on the outside then tracked the leading duo, went four wide on the turn then came five wide into the stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths,
battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. MAID OF HONOR broke a step slow, was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came
off the rail into upper stretch, moved out near the furlong marker and failed to threaten. PINK POSSE disputed the pace on the outside while in hand, vied in
the three path on the turn, was crowded while dropping back inside the three-sixteenths and faded. (Rail at 26 Feet)

strong urging. STROLLIN THE BAYOU was taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, moved out leaving the
backstretch, launched a rally while three then four wide on the far turn, closed strongly to get the lead into upper stretch then drifted in while moving clear,
led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while well clear for the place. NORTH OF EDEN went three wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, bumped with an opponent late on the backstretch, went three wide between horses on the far turn and lacked the needed response while able to
get the show. HERBS LOVE went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was caught five wide early on the far turn then dropped to the three path,
swung five wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. HERO OF GOLD went three wide on the first turn, settled in second position, bumped with a foe late
on the backstretch, was urged between horses in the two path on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to respond. CUBS WIN settled on the
inside, was urged along late on the backstretch, saved ground into the stretch, moved out at the three-sixteenths and came up empty. OVER THE BLUES

Footnotes
GASTOWN bumped with a rival at the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved near the back, went three then four wide on the far turn,
rallied seven wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead inside the three-sixteenths, kicked clear inside the furlong marker and proved much the best
while eased up in the final few strides. TAPTIME bumped lightly with a foe after the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was ridden
along while three wide on the far turn, chased into the final furlong and earned the place while no match for the winner. DANGER ZONE went two then three
wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace, drafted two to three wide on the far turn, was asked five wide at the quarter-pole, chased into the final furlong
and weakened but earned the show. HOT AS BLUE BLAZES bumped with a rival into the first turn, went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear,
was roused while three wide on the far turn then came four wide into the stretch, moved out at the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed kick. MS SATCH
MO was hustled from the start, went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a three wide bid on the far turn, took the lead while
asked at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive inside the three-sixteenths and weakened. FLATTERINGAPPLAUSE bumped lightly with a rival
just after the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, went three then four wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch and
failed to threaten. RUMPUS was away well from the outside post then angled in while going to the front, set the pace on the inside, was headed while asked
at the quarter-pole and gave way. MASKED MANDATE bumped with a rival at the start, bumped with another foe into the first turn, went five wide on that
bend, was rated on the outside, went four wide while let out on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch then drifted out under a left-handed whip and tired.
MISS UNIONIST went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the back, was urged two to three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. BELLA'S
CHOICE broke in at the start, settled on the inside, moved off the rail under urging on the far turn, steadied behind a foe around the three-sixteenths and
was no factor. ANDREA'S ANGEL went around the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace, dropped back fast while inside leaving the
backstretch and retreated.
