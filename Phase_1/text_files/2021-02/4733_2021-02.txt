Footnotes
GLORY ROLL, urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch and edged away late under some right
handed pressure. HEATHER HILLS angled inwards to prompt the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn but proved no match in late stages.
MARCHING IN broke inwards exchanging repeated contact with SAY ADIOS at the start, angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing into the
lane but lacked the needed late bid. SAY ADIOS, exchanged bumps at the start, then switched out three deep on the backstretch tracking just off the
second flight to the turn and continued evenly to late stages. SUNSET EMPIRE angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes racing to the turn and
faded into upper stretch. MY COTTON ROSE broke slowly and dropped out early.

Footnotes
DANNYHILL broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival through
the turn to upper stretch and edged forward late under firm right handed pressure. EASTER CHOCOLATE angled inwards gaining terms with the
pacesetter, pressed the issue racing through the turn to upper stretch and was just outfinished. RANSOMS REWARD stumbled at the start, then exchanged
bumps with HONEY BEEST, was righted to gain a position just off the leaders between foes while shifting about in close quarters racing through the
backstretch, angled nearer to the inside when gaining a clear path racing into upper stretch and edged a rival for a share nearing the wire. BAROLA tracked
just off the first flight outside foes racing to the turn, was prompted to advance three wide on the bend but flattened out in the drive. ROYAL GOLD DIGGER
angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing in close quarters early, faded into the stretch, then shifted to the four path in the closing stages.
HONEY BEEST, bumped at the start, retreated early.

Footnotes
SOUL REFLECTION sped to the lead soon after the break to open a clear advantage racing well off the rail to the turn, held sway in the two path to upper
stretch, then widened his margin while his rider flashed a right handed whip to go well clear under mild hand urging. FLASH IT, cut off just after the start,
then knocked back when losing his path, recovered racing through the backstretch to split foes three wide advancing on the leaders racing into the turn, was
fanned to the five path in upper stretch but continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors late. FLYING BANKROLL broke readily, tracked just
off the pacesetter four deep on the backstretch, continued outside that foe to upper stretch and faded late. THE SPIDER, off a bit slowly, then held up
avoiding tight quarters at the start, dropped out last on the backstretch but steadily improved position between foes into the lane. SEATTLE COUNCIL,
caught in close quarters just after the start, was held up, then settled outside foes in the last flight early and never menaced thereafter. COUSIN made brief
pursuit of the leader between foes racing to the turn but emptied out early. WEST SIDE WARRIOR tracked the pacesetter three wide between foes to the
turn and faded into upper stretch. AT THE BEACH, urged inside foes to contend in the opening quarter, dropped back early.

TIZ APPROVED was urged between foes to go clear near the inside racing into the turn, widened his margin racing into upper stretch and was kept to the
task under right handed pressure. EXECUTIVE DECREE, forwardly placed four wide tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, shifted inwards
pursuing the leader into upper stretch but lost ground to that foe while prevailing for the place honors. MIDNIGHT BOLT tracked the pacesetter three deep
between foes in the opening stages, continued in pursuit in tandem with a rival while angling inwards into the lane and weakened late. BRANDT tracked off
the second flight five wide in the opening stages and continued evenly outside foes into the stretch. WILD WINTER was off last and proved no threat.
BEYOND STREETSMART settled off the second flight while angling inwards racing through the backstretch and soon dropped out. KNOX COURT was
urged in brief pursuit along the rail, was pulled up entering the turn, then was vanned off the course following the race.

advance, steadily gained on the pacesetter three wide between foes racing to upper stretch and continued with a sustained response to prevail in time
under firm left handed pressure. THE STIFLER was urged three deep between foes into the first turn to gain a clear advantage remaining off the rail racing
to the backstretch, held sway on a comfortable margin to upper stretch, resisted when challenged in the closing stages but couldn't contain the winner while
prevailing for the place honors. MYSTIC LINK, caught four wide while prompted to a contending position racing into the first turn, eased off the second flight
racing into the backstretch, angled to the inside entering the far turn while being prompted to advance, shifted out in upper stretch to bid between foes in late
stages but was outkicked by the top pair. BOLD PAYNTER settled last racing to the far turn, came around foes nearing upper stretch, angled inside rivals
entering the lane and continued to close the gap with a belated bid. TOUPHA, restless in the gate, was a step slow into stride while settling outside foes,
raced four, then five wide into upper stretch and couldn't make a serious impression. PROFESSIONAL, forwardly placed between foes, continued in pursuit
of the pacesetter in the three path through the far turn to upper stretch and gave way. PLATO was urged inside rivals prompting the pace racing to the
backstretch and gave way abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
RACE DAY SPEED was rated between rivals behind the second flight racing through the backstretch, shifted three deep on the turn while being prompted
to advance outside foes, angled four wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to edge GRIMHILDE in time under firm encouragement. The
latter tracked off the first flight outside foes racing through the backstretch, advanced three deep nearing the lane to challenge for command, went clear
midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner. CLAP FOR ME shifted off the rail racing through the backstretch to track off the first flight between foes and
continued evenly between rivals to late stages to prevail for a share. BODACIOUS BLEND was settled last in the opening stages, angled outside foes to
race in the six path in closing stages but continued with a belted effort to improve position. WHAT A KNOCKOUT was rated off the second flight outside foes
racing to the turn and never gained contention. CRYSTAL SKY switched out three wide in early stages while being urged in pursuit of the leaders, pressed
the pace racing into the turn and gave way in upper stretch. GLOBAL QUEEN COCO, prominent between foes in the opening stages, dueled for command
outside a rival in early stages, continued to dispute the issue inside a rival on the turn into upper stretch and gave way. GENERAL GINNY, caught five wide
in the opening stages, steadily faded racing into the turn. BLAZING MISS JOJO angled to the rail in the opening furlong disputing the pace inside a rival and
emptied out early.

Footnotes
HOITY TOITY was rated between foes while angling inwards racing to the first turn tracking off the second flight, gained some position nearing the far turn,
shifted three deep on the far turn while being prompted to advance, bid for command in that path entering upper stretch, then gamely turned back the
challenge of GET BACK HOME to hold that rival on a safe margin under firm left handed encouragement. The latter, shuffled back avoiding tight quarters at
the start, was rated along the inside to the backstretch, split foes while angling out four wide nearing upper stretch, moved to challenge the eventual winner
racing through the lane but was just outkicked. INHONOROFOWENJR settled along the inside in early stages, shifted out to gain position between foes just
off the inside after a half, was urged to advance into the far turn, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch to bid for command inside foes and was just
outkicked. TWISTED TREASURE sped to the fore while angling inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing into the far turn, dueled into the lane
and gave way between foes leaving midstretch. SUNNYMEDE DREAM, forwardly placed stalking a rival's pace in the opening half, advanced to press the
issue between foes on the far turn but gave way abruptly entering the lane. MOMS LOVE tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight, but
steadily faded racing into the far turn. DEESSE held up between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, offered no rally. NEW YORK COMMANDER
tracked the leaders three wide in second flight to the backstretch and steadily faded after a half. KATZ YOU LATER was rated outside foes racing four wide
to the backstretch and never a proved serious threat. CLOVER BEACH tracked off the second flight racing three, then four wide into the backstretch and
retreated early.
