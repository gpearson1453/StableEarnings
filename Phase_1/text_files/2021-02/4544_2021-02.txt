Footnotes
COMEDY TOWN took control after the start, rated along through an even pace in the two-path, responded when roused into the stretch and stayed clear
under a mild drive. OFFICIATING prompted the pace outside COMEDY TOWN from the outset, had aim through the lane, finished well and settled for
second best. BORKAN raced three wide in range to the stretch, and finished one-paced to remain clear of the others. CREATIVE CLOUD went along in the
second flight to the far turn near the two-path, and lacked a closing bid. HIGHER LAW hit the left side of the gate and came out a couple lengths slow,
moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and posed no threat. DUNKLE saved ground and failed to menace. NACHO SUPREME rushed up inside after
breaking a step slow, saved ground just off the leaders to the head of the stretch, and came up empty. MARACAIBO tired inside leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
LEN LO LADY tracked the leader while forwardly placed along the inside, began to narrow that foe's margin at the three furlong pole, ranged up outside of
the leader at quarter pole, quickly assumed command entering the lane, drew off under mild urging in upper stretch, and was wrapped up approaching the
wire. HIGH FASHION lied off of the pace two wide, took the turn in the two to three path, then surpassed the tiring pace setter foe place in the late stages.
VEGAS WEEKEND set the pace along the inside, drew clear into the turn, but met LEN LO LADY's bid at the quarter pole, quickly proved no match for that
foe turning for home, weakened through the lane, and lost place late. THE JOKES ON ME pressed the pace setter two wide down the chute, but came
under a drive to keep pace with that foe into the turn, failed to do so, then tired around the turn. FAMILY TIME took the turn in the four path while far off of
the pace, and never got involved. YES IT'S FREE trailed the field in the three path around the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
INDY TOURIST alternated between the rail and the two-path tracking the leaders for six furlongs, shifted to the three-path with a bid through upper stretch,
and forged past outside through the last 70 yards. CHAO bumped with ON A TOUR at the start, got a bit closer to the front flight in the three-path after six
furlongs, moved inside through upper stretch, rallied between horses a sixteenth out and finished with good energy inside the winner. FAMOUS GENT was
four wide entering the first turn, moved in prompting GOLOVKIN from outside, challenged for command around the far turn and into the stretch, and
flattened out late. GOLOVKIN bumped with HONORABLE at the start, set a moderate pace inside, responded when hooked on the far turn, then yielded
late. HONORABLE bobbled and bumped with GOLOVKIN at the start, raced three wide and had no closing rally. ON A TOUR bumped with CHAO at the
start, brushed with SOUTHERN PASSAGE and steadied early, and could not reach contention. SOUTHERN PASSAGE brushed with ON A TOUR and
steadied early, checked along the rail entering the first turn, and tired inside.

Footnotes
FAVORITE SIN set the pace two wide early on, cleared foes down the backstretch before shifting to the rail into the turn, felt pressure from BOXER
REBELLION around the bend, but shook clear from that rival turning for home, then held sway through the lane. EMMA ROSE vied along the inside before
taking back down the backstretch to stalk the leader, saved ground while tracking that foe around the turn, smoothly tipped outside of that rival entering the
stretch, but only managed to chase her home, and safely held place. RASPBERRY BALLET trailed early on, gained while shifting from the two path to the
four path around the turn, and stayed on through the lane, but ran out of ground to achieve place. BOXER REBELLION got very fractious in the gate waiting
for others to load, but did not require to be backed out, lied off of the pace down the chute, pulled two wide leaving it, was sent between horses passing the
nine sixteenths marker to make an early bid for the lead at the half mile pole, vied outside of the eventual winner around the turn, but weakened turning for
home. ISHFAAQ prompted the pace three wide, but came under a drive to keep pace into the turn, failed to respond around the bend, and weakened
thereafter. TOURING EGYPT lied forwardly placed four wide, but was through after a half mile.

DREAM FRIEND grabbed the lead soon after the start, showed the way inside to the stretch, and responded to remain in command. CAIRO CAMPAIGN
was forwardly placed from the start, bid outside DREAM FRIEND turning for home, could not get by and saved the place. BUFFALO MAX was outrun early
inside, swung to the far outside coming off the far turn, and finished with good energy. PRETENDANT raced three wide around the turns, and was
outfinished between horses. POSITIVE PHIL raced two to three wide, was jostled around a bit between HERO UP and PRETENDANT on the far turn, and
finished evenly. STRONG ENDING failed to menace inside. NINJA DUST was never prominent. BEINFUN saved ground on the turns, and faded after six
furlongs. HERO UP pressed the early pace outside DREAM FRIEND, and was finished before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
SHOP GIRL set the pace along the inside, shook clear in upper stretch, and held safely to the wire. PENS STREET stalked along the inside, lost position
into the turn to be far off of the pace at the seven sixteenths pole, but commenced a rally while shifting three wide to split foes in upper stretch, narrowed the
leader's margin through the final furlong, but did not have enough to catch her. FLIGHT TO SHANGHAI chased while close to the pace two wide down the
backstretch, then from along the inside around the turn after an inner foe faltered, but failed to produce a bid after shifting off of the rail in upper stretch, and
held show. SKY PROPOSAL lied off of the pace in the three path, gained mildly outside of foes passing the five sixteenths marker, but was outkicked by an
inner rival in upper stretch, leveled off, and failed to reach show. REINFORCED pressed three wide, inched forward to bid for the lead at the quarter pole,
but was repelled the by leader turning for home, and faltered between horses while hanging on her left lead at the furlong grounds. VIVA LA REINA vied two
wide, but weakened between horses passing the five sixteenths pole. SILENT SPARKLE was outrun.

Footnotes
ZAP DADDY saved ground in the second flight for six furlongs, moved out three wide in upper stretch, kicked in with good determination and was up late
outside rivals. BOURBON CURRENCY moved inside around the first turn, rallied late between horses and finished gamely. CALIBRATOR vied inside
OCEANS MAP early, shook loose up the backstretch, remained clear through mid stretch, then yielded inside the top two finishers. CALL CURT stayed near
the three-path for six furlongs, came a bit wider into the lane, and gained mildly outside the leaders. PLEASECALLMEBACK was outrun inside to the far
turn, shifted out three wide past the quarter-pole and improved without threatening. SHOOTIN THE BREEZE advanced three wide after six furlongs, but
could not sustain the rally. SLIPPIN JIMMY angled to the far outside coming off the far turn, and could not gain. OCEANS MAP vied outside CALIBRATOR
early, stayed on the chase to the end of the far turn, and retreated. EMPIRE EXPRESS raced three to four wide, and was through soon after completing a
half-mile.

Footnotes
RENAISANCE FROLIC stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leader entering the lane while outkicking outer foes, bid outside of the pace setter at
the furlong grounds, and drew off. SAND DANCER trailed along the inside, awaited racing room behind FOREVER MO in upper stretch, found a hole inside
the final furlong, and surged between rivals to outfinish the aforementioned foe for place. FOREVER MO lied off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the
the two path turning for home, then to the three path in midstretch to produce a late kick, but was outfinished by an inner surging rival for place.
UNMOORED set the pace along the inside, scooted away from pressing foes turning for home with RENAISANCE FROLIC in pursuit, but was headed by
that foe passing the furlong pole, and tired. MO MAVERICK tracked from midpack two wide, advanced to a three wide stalking position into the far turn,
produced a mild bid turning for home, but was outkicked by an inner foe shortly after, chased that rival through the lane, but faded late. IDENTIFIER lied off
of the pace in the two to three paths around the turns, and failed to factor. GEMONTEER achieved stalking position while shifting from the three path to the
two path around the first turn, held that stand through the far turn, but was outkicked by an inner rival turning for home, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MY SARASOTA STAR set the pace removed from the rail, was under a drive to repel a challenge from LORILOUPIES coming to the quarter-pole,
maintained the advantage three wide into the stretch, and remained clear under pressure. SHES ALL WOMAN was taken off the inside midway up the
backstretch, came four wide off the turn and rallied outside to pick up the place. LORILOUPIES pressed the pace outside MY SARASOTA STAR, came
under heavy pressure challenging in the four-path approaching the stretch, could not get by and weakened through the final furlong. DOMINEER raced two
wide around the turn, and could not threaten with an even finish. FOXY MISCHIEF lacked the needed rally inside. LET'S BE HONEST raced three to four
wide, and was through early. COMP'D chased three wide early, and faltered after a half-mile.

Footnotes
WINTER PRINCESS stalked from the two path around the first turn, rated under a snug hold as BLUE EYED KITTEN made an early move to his outside
down the backstretch, lied just off of the leaders' flanks three wide around the far turn, bid for the lead turning for home sparking a duel with TAKE ME AS I
AM, and prevailed over that foe in the late stages. TAKE ME AS I AM set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of pressing foes around the
far turn, dug in as WINTER PRINCESS loomed large turning for home, dueled gamely inside of that foe through the lane, but was bested late. SHORT
CIRCUIT broke outwardly causing a foe to be pinched back, tracked from midpack along the inside, advanced subtly two to four wide around the far turn,
and sustained her mild grind through the lane to just reach show. TIME SENSITIVE stalked two wide, then along the inside behind the trio of leaders around
the far turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, but lacked a kick to produce a bid, chased the leaders home, and got outfinished for show.
SHE'SANEARTHMOVER stalked along the inside, retreated to midpack down the backstretch, but saved ground around the far turn, sustained her chase
along the rail through the lane, but failed to threaten. JOY IN GRACE lied off of the pace two wide, then three to four wide around the far turn, and failed to
make an impact. DORA PRINCELLA broke a step slowly, saved ground far off of the pace around the first turn, took the far turn three to five wide, and
improved through the lane. MISS AMENDMENT was pinched back at the start, trailed the field, took the far turn three wide, and failed to factor.
BACKSPARK saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. BLUE EYE KITTEN tracked from midpack in the three path around the first turn, gained outside
of foes into hte backstretch to produce an early bid for the lead at the half mile pole, vied outside of TAKE ME AS I AM around the far turn, but weakened
between horses in upper stretch. FABIOLA PRINCESS was off slowly, maneuvered to the two path while far off of the pace into the first turn, but was outrun
thereafter.
