Footnotes
MANICOMIO raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, offered a bid nearing the
three-eighths marker, opened a clear margin soon after and drew off as a handy winner. POLITICAL raced unhurried early, advanced four-wide through the
second turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. WATCHTHEBOURBON sprinted clear before going a quarter,
saved ground while setting the pace and gave way to the winner after going three-quarters. ROCKIN RON was bumped the break then forwardly placed
from the inside and gradually weakened. GOTTAWAY was off a step slow, lagged early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly.
ROOF TOP BAR raced off the pacesetters from the inside throughout and lacked the needed rally. IMAGINE WINNING was bumped at the break, chased
the leaders while racing three-wide for a half and weakened. WHISKEY DREAMIN chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after three
furlongs and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
JOHNNY SACK hopped at the start, moved into contention quickly, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a
furlong to run and drew off with complete authority. PORTAL ONE pressed the pace of CRY NO MORE while racing three-wide, moved up to take command
nearing the three-sixteenths pole, gained a brief lead and yielded to the winner. ALOYSIUS LUCK settled off the leaders from between foes, moved
three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly. CRY NO MORE set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way after
going a half. BILLINGSGATE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gradually gave way in the drive. COSMICALITY showed no early speed, saved
ground through the turn and was not a factor. FRANCIS X. lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not menace. GOLDEN G showed brief
speed and weakened.

through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane when asked. TIZ MANDATE was off slow then was unhurried early, moved four-wide through the
turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and was up for the place. KENNY HAD A NOTION tracked the pace of the winner from the inside, angled out into the
stretch, was no match for that rival in the drive and lost the place late. SUBSIDIZE chased the winner while racing four-wide and weakened after going
three-quarters. NEWYEARSBLOCKPARTY was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and
weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
LUCKY STRIDE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, gained command into the stretch, opened a clear margin
and held sway to the wire. LANDING ZONE was never far back while racing along the inside, dropped back nearing the five-sixteenths marker, angled out
nearing the quarter, continued on in the drive and finished willingly. ARTFUL SPLATTER stalked the pace of FLASHNDYNAMITE while racing three-wide,
moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive. LUCKY MOVE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through
the second turn and finished evenly. DAPHNE MOON lacked early foot, checked nearing the seven-eighths pole, saved ground through the second turn,
angled out approaching the stretch and did not menace. FLASHNDYNAMITE sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and
weakened after going five furlongs. WICKED AWESOME showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and weakened. PAT'S NO FOOL
showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.

STREET LUTE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin into the lane and held
FRAUDULENT CHARGE at bay to the wire. FRAUDULENT CHARGE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, was carried out further nearing
the three-sixteenths pole and finished with good courage. SALT PLAGE settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the
stretch, angled back in with a furlong to run and finished willingly. BUCKEY'S CHARM lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out
further in mid-stretch and finished with a belated bid. LADY CLAU raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly.
MISS LESLIE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, steadied in mid-stretch and did not menace. WHISKEY AND RYE broke sharply
to press the pace of LITTLE HUNTRESS while racing three-wide and weakened after going five furlongs. LITTLE HUNTRESS was away in good order to
set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened after going five-eighths. MY MY GIRL bobbled at the start, lagged and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
HIBISCUS PUNCH was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew
off. ESTILO TALENTOSO settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, drifted out through the lane and finished with a steady rally. CLUB
CAR raced off the pacesetters from the inside, angled out into the stretch and failed to gain late. NEEDS SUPERVISION raced off the leaders early, drifted
out through the turn and finished evenly. HELLO BEAUTIFUL pressed the pace of DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA while racing three-wide, moved up to engage
that foe nearing the five-sixteenths pole and failed to sustain her rally. SHARP STARR showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not
menace. DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA was away in good order to set a pressured pace and weakened after going five furlongs. SUGGESTIVE HONOR
(ARG) showed brief speed and weakened.

Footnotes
SHARE THE RIDE dueled for the lead from between foes, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with complete authority. TATTOOED raced
unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. LAKI disputed the pace from the inside, angled out nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, stayed on well and finished willingly. LEBDA settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the
drive. ARTHUR'S HOPE vied for the early advantage while racing four-wide, drifted out into the stretch and gradually gave way. INFORMATIVE raced off
the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. CHILLY IN CHARGE was void of early foot, raced five-wide through
the turn and was not a factor. MAJESTIC DUNHILL was off a step slow then allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn angled out into the stretch and
did not reach contention. FUNNY GUY raced off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
HEMP was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the fore nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and was ridden out to the wire. FLAT CAT was pinched back at the start, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the
turn, angled out further into the stretch, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. FORTH dueled for the lead from
the inside, stayed on well in the drive and gave way through the final furlong. IMAGINE HONGKONG lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn,
angled out into the lane, angled in with a furlong to run and finished evenly. UNCLE ROAMIE disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way after
going a half. PHAROAH'S FURY chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after a half. JUNIPERO was off a step slow and lagged
throughout.
