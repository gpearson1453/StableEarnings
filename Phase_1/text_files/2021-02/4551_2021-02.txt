Footnotes
CENTAVO bumped at the start by TAPIT'S FLASHBACK, who broke inwards, chased three then two wide ranging up to take command near the half mile
pole before tucking to the inside into the turn, remained patiently handled through the turn, spun just off the inside for home and went clear given some taps
to the off side while in hand to the eighth pole, remained in hand through to the finish as a rival cut mildly into his margin and prevailed comfortably on the
wire. TAPIT'S FLASHBACK broke in at the start brushing the near side stall before bumping CENTAVO, chased five paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, offered up a mild bid.
OHYOUDIDNTKNOW chased four paths off the inside until tucked to the two path through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six
wide into upper stretch and improved position for the show honors. YEROSILVERBIZ broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, chased six to seven
paths off the inside down the backstretch forwardly placed before going three wide through the turn coaxed along nearing the quarter pole, continued three
wide into upper stretch and tired. BLACK LIMO took the overland route eight paths off the inside down the backstretch and four wide through the turn, got
coaxed along three furlongs from home, went seven wide at the head of the stretch and gave way. NEW SOUTH showed the way early on four then three
wide, had CENTAVO advance inside and was headed for command near the half mile pole, tucked to the two path through the turn and was placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths, faded and went four wide for home, then faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
RUN CASPER RUN away a length the tardiest, moved up under his own power into midpack on the backstretch, was kept on hold idling behind the
pacesetter during the later stages of the run around the bend, began to inch its way to the outside, eventually squeezing his way into the two path as the
half was being rattled off, but having forced one rival, that is KENTUCKY COOL to check, having shouldered another, BROOKLYN LAW wider prior to
spinning into the lane, and having induced two other opponents, those being GHOST STALKER and DANG IT into taking wider routes into the lane
themselves, straightened away in path three soon afterwards and was given his cue right around the three-sixteenths marker, forged to the front just inside
the eighth pole, edged away then dug in well to be the first to cross the wire. BROOKLYN LAW worked out a tuck into the two path at the top of the turn,
crept up to the front runners, was forced to check when interfered with by RUN CASPER RUN approaching the quarter pole, got going and cut the corner
into the stretch, tipped back into path two and fought its way to a narrow and what turned out to be a short-lived advantage, had it wrested away by the
unofficial winner, showed some willingness to the end but wasn't able to re-claim the top. KENTUCKY COOL prompted the pace towards path two, was
shouldered into going three wide into the lane by RUN CASPER RUN, shifted yet another path farther off the rail soon afterwards, had to settle for the show
after going fairly evenly in the final furlong. GHOST STALKER off the inside throughout, chased the pace three wide on the turn, was induced into venturing
into path four entering the stretch, in reaction to the wayward RUN CASPER RUN, left the three-sixteenths pole five wide, flattened out. COMPETITIVE
HERO established the top in short order, threw down the initial two splits on a loosely-contested advantage, got let out for the drive, relinquished at the
furlong grounds then steadily weakened. DANG IT parked out along the overland route, had no rally. LET'S WORKOUT underwent a four wide pursuit on
the turn, commenced the stretch one wider, gave way. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on an incident at the quarter pole, in addition to a claim of foul
lodged by the rider of BROOKLYN LAW against the rider of RUN CASPER RUN alleging interference, the latter was disqualified from first and placed third.

LIAM'S FIRE just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch taking over
command, dug in under a drive under threat to the finish and held gamely to prevail. UNRELENTING FORCE established the front and showed the way
under a light hold five paths off the inside, tucked three wide through the turn and came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper
stretch and was displaced from the front straightening for home, dug in under a drive fighting on latched on to the finish but was ultimately repelled to the
wire. SPITBALL broke in at the start and brushed with LIAM'S FIRE, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the
turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened in the late stages. COOLBOY chased two to three wide under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
VITANZA suffered some light contact with GRAPE THERAPY after losing her footing springing from the gate, took up position in midpack, departed the
backstretch from the four path, was let loose for the drive home, gained ground in a steadfast manner, poking its head down in time at the wire to steal the
verdict. TINY MAGOO settled into the three path, responded when asked for more at the five-sixteenths pole, challenged in earnest stepping onto the head
of the stretch, battled her way to the front during the ensuing furlong, came under aim from the winner soon afterwards, dug in resolutely only to get nailed in
the last jump. QUEENTIGUA pressed the issue from the two path, put to snug grip on the reins early, was put to a drive for the drive, got outkicked. MILL
STONE CREEK saved ground for nearly a half, angled approximately three wide into the lane, closed in well enough to secure the final significant slice of
the purse. WOMEN NOT EASY disputed the pace from along the inside route, relinquished making her way through the furlong grounds and steadily
weakened. GRAPE THERAPY bumped lightly with the winner after lunging out at the start, moved inward, tracked the pace from just off the rail, got sent out
into path five from upper to midstretch, came up empty. LOVELEE HONOR two wide at the top of the turn, got spotted four wide at the top of the lane, failed
to menace. MADAM DEPUTY pocketed, began to falter as the half was being completed.

GONE GLIMMERING coaxed from the start led early on before being displaced by a pair of rivals and settled six paths off the inside in aim of the front,
advanced and tucked three wide at the half mile pole taking command near the seven-sixteenths, shook away through the latter portion of the turn, spun just
off the inside for home, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. STAND FOR THE FLAG coaxed from the gate, chased
five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. KANSAS KIS chased four then three

Footnotes
BANK STING remained along the inside after having established the top, led the way, firmly rated and being prompted by STEPPIN' HAWK from the
outside, kicked clear when let loose for the drive, held on well in the final furlong to stay sufficiently in the clear. MOON SWEEPER got going after losing her
footing springing from the starting gate, was set up in the two path prior to departing the backstretch, got shuffled back beginning from the general area of
the five-sixteenths marker, forced to idle behind a wall comprised of four equines, settled into upper stretch and was given its cue, tipped a bit wider,
responded and began to narrow in, split foes in the deep stretch and got up for the place. LUCKY GIRL out with her initial gate, struck the left side of the
gate, proceeded along backstretch well off the rail, travelled about the turn towards the four path, commenced the stretch one farther off the inside, made no
late headway. LA KARA MIA towards midpack for the opening phases, chased the pace three wide on the turn, flashed some interest when set down in the
vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, kept up that momentum until midstretch then flattened out. VIENNA CODE underwent a ground-saving journey, was
switched to stronger handling after more than halfway around the turn after having lost position, stepped into the lane and lacked the necessary response.
STEPPIN' HAWK pressed the issue two wide until the end of the bend before giving way.

POSSETIZZLY got bumped at the start by KAZ'S BEACH due to pressure from the veering out JACK BO forcing BAD GUY to steady in behind, chased two
to three wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, rallied in tandem
with KAZ'S BEACH to his inside knocking heads to confront the leader as a pair inside the final furlong latching on that rival a sixteenth out, took narrow
command seventy yards from home and gamely prevailed on the wire. KAZ'S BEACH got bumped at the start by the veering out JACK BO and in turn
bumped POSSETIZZLY, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, rallied knocking heads with the
aforementioned foe through the final furlong to collar the leader seventy yards from home but was ultimately rebuffed to the finish while up for the place
honors. HOLD MY CALL four then three wide in pursuit, advanced on the leader three furlongs from home to stack outside the top pair, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole, took over command swinging four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat through the final furlong and was collared
seventy yards from home. RAVEN ROCKS broke a half a beat slow and was forced to steady off the heels of the veering out JACK BO, conceded four to
five lengths to the front, angled out to chase five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and offered up a mild kick to close in for the last major share. BAD GUY got forced to steady at the start in
behind foes who were bumped directly in his path and conceded four lengths to the front, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home,
got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS prompted the pace
three then two wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. JACK BO veered out at the
start bumping KAZ'S BEACH into POSSETIZZLY and forcing both RAVEN ROCKS and BAD GUY to steady in behind rivals, established the front and
showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from the aforementioned foe, came under pressure from a pair midway on the turn and got
placed to coaxing in response, spun just off the inside for home displaced from the front, then tired in the drive. TROUBLESHOOTER coaxed from the gate,
chased five to six wide under coaxing from the three-eighths and tired.

Footnotes
MANI PEDI involved in a three-way scramble for the advantage between rivals early, got eased back, made it into the pocket by the top of the turn, kept
watch on the pace contestants within striking distance, got cued up a few jumps shy of the quarter pole, was worked into path three from the top of the
stretch to the three-sixteenths pole, closed in on the one to catch, struck the front end in the vicinity of the eighth pole, edged away, held on late to preserve
the decision. GRINGOTTS took up the chase three wide, swung out five wide early during the stretch run, rallied for the place. MEBS WEB remained
stationed along the inside route after the field had been sent off and running, battled as the innermost of three during the initial stages and afterwards one
on one with JARA, was put to a drive as three-quarters was being reeled, yielded with about a furlong to go, weakened into the show slot. JARA disputed
the pace outside a pair of opponents until midway on the backstretch, saw the top one back out of the fracas and went on to argue to the outside of MEBS
WEB, kept at it until upper stretch then backed away. IMPRSSTHEPROFESSOR sluggish after leaning in with her first step, darted over to the rail, took it
for nearly six furlongs, got let out a notch at the five-sixteenths pole, was then set down maneuvering into path six from upper to midlane, had no some gain.
HAPPYCREST chased the pace two wide on the turn, was about as wide spinning into the lane, had no closing punch. APPRECIATE underwent a
ground-saving journey, failed to respond when asked at the five-sixteenths pole, came into the stretch and readily faltered. ALEXACRAT two to three wide
on the turn, was more the latter going into the stretch, failed to menace.
