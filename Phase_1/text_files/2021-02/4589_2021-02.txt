Footnotes
ATLANTIC ROAD coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from THREE TWO ZONE to the outside, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, got headed for command by his main prompter inside the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home taking back
the front straightened away for home, dug in under a drive rebuffing that challenger and was confronted inside the final furlong by the runner up, clung
stubbornly to the lead to prevail on the wire. NEPOTISM coaxed from the start, chased along the inside until tipped to the two path at the nine-sixteenths,
went three wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge
through the final furlong but was ultimately repelled at the finish. THREE TWO ZONE prompted the pace of ATLANTIC ROAD from the outside in the three
path, took over command inside the five-sixteenths patiently handled, continued three wide into upper stretch and was set down for the drive, got headed
straightened away, dug in latched on to the eighth pole before weakening in the late stages. WILL E SUTTON coaxed from the start, chased just off the
inside until tucked inside briefly at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing in the two path once more three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late going. MINUTEMAN (GER) chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home,
offered no response. DREAM BIG DREAMS three then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, went four wide into upper stretch and
faltered.

Footnotes
CLENCH set up along the inside route before reaching the conclusion of the backstretch, patiently kept watch on RUNAWAY LUTE, got cued up angling
three wide into the stretch, gained ground in a steadfast manner, wore down the aforementioned foe in the final seventy yards and edged clear. RUNAWAY
LUTE moved up under his own power after the field had been sent off and running to establish the top, remained stationed along the inside route cutting the
pace on a loosely-contested lead,, rider holding something in reserve, was put to a drive entering the head of the stretch, got collared well inside the
sixteenth pole, had no trouble salvaging second. BATTERBATTERSWING stalked the pace from path two, got called upon coming up to the
three-sixteenths pole, momentarily lugged in a couple of jumps later, got outkicked. HOME RUN MAKER settled into the two path by the half mile pole,
brought up the back of the pack, got roused at the five-sixteenths pole, shifted slightly closer to the rail at the top of lane, gave way.

MISS BRAZIL coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home,
remained patiently handled as GULF COAST made a bid through the latter portion of the turn, got roused spinning just off the inside for home, drew off
under a drive to the eighth pole, then got ridden out through to the finish to prevail. GULF COAST broke in at the start bumping with DEALING JUSTICE,
who broke out a step, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch lightly coaxed along latched on to the outside of the remaining pair, tucked three
wide into the turn placed to firmer coaxing before taking to the two path near the three-eighths as DEALING JUSTICE began to fade between foes, offered
up a bid to pressure the front in the latter portion of the bend, swung three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on under
her own power through to the finish. DEALING JUSTICE broke out a step at the start bumping with GULF COAST, who broke inwards, raced four paths off
the inside between foes down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths beginning to be
unable to keep pace, faded through the turn, went five to six wide into upper stretch and was eased through to the wire.

Footnotes
MO DESSERTS at or near the inside route, grabbed away the advantage after the first fraction had been posted, sailed along setting the pace, shadowed
by O'GOTTEN GIRL one path farther off the rail, arrived at the three-sixteenths pole and got called upon for more, drew off to a comfortable margin before
being taken in hand once more for the last sixteenth. O'GOTTEN GIRL prompted the winner two wide for nearly three-quarters, stepped into the stretch and
proved no match. BRAVO REGINA tucked into the two path, sat within range of the top twosome until the end of the bend, fanned out into the five path from
upper to midstretch, went on secure the show. HANDLE THE TRUTH two wide onto the turn, angled three wide exiting it, never made her presence felt.
CRYSTAL ORB hustled on the chute, was briefly part of the pace scenario, got guided onto the rail at the half mile pole, was hand ridden travelling on the
turn, cut the corner into the stretch and readily retreated.

Footnotes
EXCESS CAPACITY bobbled at the start veering in when recovering and forcing NASTY AFFAIR to steady off her heels, showed the way in hand just off
the inside, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to
the eighth pole, dug in and held well to prevail. VIOLENT TRICK coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. VIRADIA chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner
into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. DARIA'S ANGEL stumbled at the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. MONGOLIAN HUMOR three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three
wide into upper stretch and weakened. TAKE CHARGE TINA chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through
the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. NASTY AFFAIR steadied at the start when EXCESS
CAPACITY veered in recovering from a bobble, jogged sluggishly away from the gate the rider apply off sided taps while standing in the irons, continued to
jog well behind the field at his own pace, was distanced and walked home well behind the field to the wire, then walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
SIRENIC remained stationed along the inside route after the field had been released, vied for control, matched up with PRINCESS COREY out in the two
path, shook free during the run on the turn, settled in upper stretch then got switched over to stronger handling, scampered away, kept to some
encouragement to the end. FREEDOM PASSAGE along the outside, travelled three wide on the turn, got set down attempting to challenge in earnest
heading onto the top of the lane, proved no match, saved second. ADHWAA sent over to the rail approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, swung out
four wide from upper to midstretch, missed out on the place. PRINCESS COREY spotted in path two, sparred with the winner for nearly a half, weakened
down the lane to finish out of the money. MISS MI MI strung out four wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one wider, lacked the necessary response.
DANCING KIKI rode the rail, got asked for more prior to reaching the quarter pole, shifted towards path three early during the stretch run, faltered. CADEAU
DE PAIX spotted two wide at the top of the lane, was maneuvered into path six after leaving the turn, never made its presence felt.

Footnotes
LIMONITE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, tipped out a
path three-sixteenths out and rallied to issue a challenge taking command nearing the sixteenth marker, then drew clear to the finish to prevail. EMPTY
TOMB bucked at the break striking the near side stall and conceding three lengths to the front, tracked the pace from just off the inside until tucked inside
half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the place honors.
BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON coaxed from the gate, went three wide into the first turn and established the front crossing to the rail midway, showed the way in
hand just off the inside under the watchful eye of DANNY CALIFORNIA to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared nearing the sixteenth pole, then weakened in the late stages
while well clear for the show honors. DANNY CALIFORNIA coaxed from the start, raced just off the inside through the first turn being taken in hand as
BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON crossed in front midway on that bend, attended that rival to the outside down the backstretch three to four wide, tucked to the two
path through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and applying pressure through the latter portion of the turn, spun three wide for home
and weakened in the stretch. SOMEDAY JONES just off the inside through the first turn, chased three to four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out,
angled five wide into upper stretch and faltered. ACKER coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside through the first turn, then chased four then three
wide through the backstretch and far turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. AMERICAN
RULE broke awkwardly conceding four lengths to the front, went four then three wide through the first turn before chasing four wide down the backstretch
and through the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung seven wide at the head of the stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MOVIE SCORE established the top in short order, cut over to the inside, getting placed along the inside route by midpoint on the backstretch, showed the
way on a loosely-contested lead, got settled in at the head of the stretch and was switched over to stronger handling, drew well clear.
WHYISSHESOOLUCKY pursued the pace two wide on the turn, got sent out into path four from upper stretch, proved no match en route for place honors.
PERSIAN QUEEN tracked the front runners from along the rail, got asked to pick it up right around the five-sixteenths pole, cut corner into the stretch, got
outkicked. DIRTY BIRD lost its footing springing from the starting gate, stalked the pace from the two path, stepped into the lane ridden along, backed away.
MOLLY'S GAME raced three to four wide on the turn, got moved out five wide after entering the turn, never got involved. ROSE RING chased the pace from
the two path, got let loose leaving the five-sixteenths pole, commenced the stretch one path wider, gave out. DRAGONESS underwent a three wide journey,
was through after going a half.
