Footnotes
FLY TO MARS bumped with PRODIGAL SON early, was closest in pursuit through the early stages, drew alongside on the far turn and headed rival at the
quarter, cleared into the stretch, urged once right-handed mid-stretch and remained unchallenged through the final furlong under urging. SOUTHERN KING
settled a bit off the rail early then moved out on the backstretch, went three deep on the second turn, moved in a bit leaving the bend and finished finished
well for the place. PRODIGAL SON got pinballed between rivals prior to entering the first turn, stalked the lone leader inside a rival, moved a bit off the rail
around the far turn, tipped out at the top of the lane and gained the show. JASIKAN (IRE) tossed head at the start to come away to a slow beginning
spotting the field a few lengths, angled to the inside quickly then steered out leaving the the first turn, traveled three to four wide around the final bend and
lacked the necessary bid when asked. CAJUN TREASURE stalked outside a rival to the stretch and weakened. CAUSEIDIDITMYWAY bumped early, sped
clear early, showed the way to the far turn, was headed by the winner at the quarter pole and gave way.

DISKO FEVER off a bit slow to begin, split foes and went up to take control, set the pace inside a pair of rivals, cleared around the turn, urged right-handed
through the lane and held well. DANCING DANA steadied early, chased outside a rival then two to three wide around the turn, angled out in upper stretch
and gained ground on the winner late. RISEN LADY showed early speed outside the top pair, chased the winner three wide to the stretch and flattened in
the late stages. POLISHED LADY sat off the pace early, angled out in the lane and split foes mid-stretch and continued on willingly for a minor share.
COMMAS SAVE LIVES stalked the pace from inside throughout and never responded to urging. BIG MAMA SUE was off a bit slow, trailed the field early,
traveled along the inside into the turn, angled out into the four path around the bend and improved position. MALIBU MISTRESS stumbled a bit leaving the
gate, appeared to be climbing along up the backstretch, went two wide into the drive, steadied and angled in at the top of the stretch and never threatened.
YELLOW DRESS settled off the pace early, went three wide into the turn, angled into the two path then steered back out and came four wide into the stretch
and failed to rally. EXCHANGE VOWS pressed the pace from between rivals up the backstretch, failed to match strides with the winner around the turn,
chased two wide leaving the bend and faded. MUCHA WOMAN traveled three wide into the turn, moved out into the five path entering the stretch and had
little left.

Footnotes
EXAULTED settled off the pace early, took closer order around the turn while angling out into the three path, chased the leader to mid-stretch then put in a
late bid and drew clear. AMERICAN THEOREM broke inward at the start, stalked outside the pacesetter early, headed rival near the quarter pole, took over
exiting the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and got caught in the final sixteenth. MONGOLIAN LEGEND saved ground into the lane, shifted out and split
foes mid-stretch and gained the show. RAYRAY tracked off the inside, went three to four wide around the turn and lacked a rally. POSTERIZE set the pace
up the backstretch inside of AMERICAN THEOREM, showed the way along the inside into the turn, raced on even terms with rival at the quarter pole, lost
command into the drive and weakened. WRECKING CREW tossed head and got shuffled back at the start, raced outside rival early then came out into the
lane and never made an impact.

Footnotes
BORU bumped leaving the gate, stalked the leader from along the fence, steered out in the stretch, rallied outside and got up late. ARMOUR PLATE
bumped at the start, pulled early on the first turn, bid outside and took over in upper stretch, led through the final furlong but was caught nearing the wire.
HARD COUNT broke in and bumped rival at the start, sped to the front, was challenged around the final bend, met that bid and fought back from inside, lost
command approaching the furlong maker, continued to battled through the late stages and proved a game third. GALLOPING MISCHIEF broke and bumped
at the start, trailed through the early going, went outside a rival into the far turn, came three deep into the stretch and bested the rest. SHOW BUSINESS
traveled near the back of the pack while outside a rival, raced between into the stretch and improved position. BIG CITY BANE was mid-pack through the
early stages, saved ground into the lane, moved out and raced between runners in the stretch and could not rally. JUGGLES stumbled, broke out and
bumped rival at the start, raced three wide into the first turn, two wide into the stretch and weakened. SURFSIDE SUNSET bumped from inside rival in the
beginning, angled to the fence around the first turn, tracked the leader from inside and was never a factor. WESTERN SMOKE up close early outside the
pacesetter, lost ground around the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
CRANKIN tracked the pace off the inside, took the turn three to four wide, rallied outside the top pair and drew clear late under a drive. STIR THE POT sped
clear to set the pace, met the bid from BETITO on the turn, held a short lead over that rival to the sixteenth pole but could not fend off the closing winner.
BETITO chased outside the leader up the backstretch, bid outside on the turn, challenged to the sixteenth pole and flattened late. TIGER'S SONG traveled
along the inside then two wide into the lane and finished evenly in the final furlong. MR. CLUTCH raced off the inside then angled to the rail on the turn,
saved ground into the stretch and lacked a rally. GOLDEN VICTORY was off the pace in the early going, took the turn two wide and could not respond when
called upon. FUN COUPONS away quickly from outside, chased the speed outside a rival, dropped back into the turn and was done early.

Footnotes
TAPWATER stalked the pace from inside, angled out on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, rallied and struck the front nearing the sixteenth pole,
then held late over the runner-up. ON MARS stumbled at the start, unhurried early from inside, angled out and had the rider lose his whip in upper stretch,
rallied under hand urging but ran out of time. MOONHALL MILLY (IRE) settled off the inside, went three wide into the lane, angled out and rallied but was
outkicked by the top pair. MISS STORMY D quickly established the front and moved to the inside, saved ground into the stretch, led through the lane and
yielded in the final sixteenth. SHE'S OUR CHARM was up close early outside the leader, coaxed two wide into the drive, lacked room behind rivals at the
eighth pole, shifted out and finished evenly. LOVE AND PEACE (FR) saved ground along the inside, tipped out in the stretch and lacked the necessary bid.
SILBERPFEIL (IRE) trailed the field to the far turn from inside, angled three wide and never threatened. QUEEN OF GOD traveled mid-pack through the
early stages while outside a rival, lost ground around the far turn, raced between rivals and was bothered in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SEICHE raced off the inside in range of the leader, came three wide into the stretch, urged left-handed in the lane, collared rival with a sixteenth to go and
proved best late. NEXT REVOLT was closest in pursuit early, bid outside around the far turn, put a head in front at the quarter pole, cleared inside rival into
the stretch, challenge by the winner at the sixteenth pole and yielded. STREET BEHAVIOR stalked the pace from inside, came out into the drive and
finished a clear third. CZECHMIGHT quickly cleared in the beginning and crossed over to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch, pressured around
the far turn, lost command at the quarter pole and weakened. K P D DAY brushed leaving the gate, tracked the pace in the two path, exited far turn two to
three wide and lacked the needed response in the lane. MEADWAY stumbled leaving the gate, traveled outside a rival at the back of the pack to the stretch
and never got involved. SPEAKEROFTHEHOUSE raced off the pace while off the rail, went four wide into the second bend, angled in a path then back out
four wide into the stretch and proved no menace. BODEGA broke in and brushed rival at the start, saved ground along the inside and never made an
impact.
