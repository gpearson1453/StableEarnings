up under all out pressure. SWEET COWGIRL was away alertly, vied for the early lead, raced well off the inside into the upper stretch, shortened strides late
and was caught near the wire to finish second best. ZIBBY TOO was a bit reluctant to load, settled towards the back early, moved up three wide at the
eighth pole and closed in on the latter stages. PLATTE GIRL vied for the early lead and gave way while racing off the inside.

early, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and had not enough in the drive. SHATTERED DREAMS dropped back early on, raced four wide at the quarter
pole and had no final winning bid. TEXAS EMPIRE settled to the middle of the pack, raced three deep in the lane and failed to have a response. KIDO'S

Footnotes
JAFMIL'S INFERNO was quick to begin to set all the pace from the inside, drew off to be well clear under a steady hand ride and raced in hand in the final
stages. FRANKI D ORO was allowed to settle early, moved up three wide at the eighth pole and was no match for the winner. MEMORIES GALORE was off
a step slow, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. EYE ON HARPER settled off the early pace, raced four deep in the
lane and had not enough in the stretch drive. CHANCE OF FROST stalked the early pace, raced three wide in the lane and had no response. HOBBS
HOPE stalked early on, was blocked approaching the three sixteenths pole, raced towards the inside and never threatened. TICKET TO RICHES was slow
early on and failed to menace. RACEY REECEY tracked the leader while racing two deep and tired readily.

Footnotes
ROCK CITY ROADHOG was allowed to settle early, moved up five wide at the eighth pole and finished well to get up under strong handling. DANCE
DOCTOR stalked the early pace, raced four deep past the three sixteenths pole and finished second best. SWISS MINISTER showed good speed from the
inside and weakened. BUBBAS DIXIE was slow early, raced four wide in the drive and showed good late interest. I'M RIVER showed good speed and gave
way. MONYDONTSPENITSELF stalked the pace and weakened towards the inside. DANZ A REBEL settled off the early pace, saved ground, lacked racing
room nearing the sixteenth pole and never was a factor. RUSHIN TOTHE FRONT failed to sustain a bid.
