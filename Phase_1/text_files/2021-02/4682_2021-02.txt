Footnotes
ROCK THE PARK broke readily to gain terms with a rival attending the pace between foes racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn into
upper stretch and went clear late under firm right handed encouragement. ONE STOP SHOP angled to the inside in the opening stages tracking off the first
flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance after a half, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady effort in that path to
prove best of the others. PURIMETER was hustled up the rail dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, was urged to resist the winner's
bid dueling for command inside that foe into upper stretch but gave way in late stages. PURCHASING POWER, urged to a position racing on terms with the
first flight three deep to the backstretch, steadily faded racing into the far turn. ROSAS WAY, held up in tight quarters at the start, was reserved between
foes to the backstretch, shifted to the inside after a half and offered no rally. NED DEVINE, settled in hand outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed
to menace thereafter.

DOC AMSTER, brushed at the start, was urged to terms forcing the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, forged clear midway through the
bend, shifted to the inside racing into upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm right handed encouragement. SOARING BIRD angled to the inside
in early stages tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, steadily gained position racing into the turn, switched outside the winner racing into upper
stretch while advancing to challenge but proved only second best. FIRE MARSHALL BILL tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight racing to the
turn, angled to the inside racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position. ZORB, urged inside the eventual winner disputing the
pace into the turn, switched outside that foe when losing terms entering the bend and gave way entering the stretch. DISTURBINGTHEPEACE, restless in
the gate, was off last and failed to menace. FIVE OF HEARTS broke inwards brushing the eventual winner, tracked off the first flight between foes racing to
the turn but faded early.

WORKINONBEINSINGLE sprinted to the lead between foes racing through the backstretch into the turn, forged clear racing into upper stretch and was kept
to firm encouragement through the closing stages to widen the advantage to the end. BILLYSBIRTHDAYGIRL, urged along three deep pursuing the
pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn, steadily lost ground to that foe racing into the lane but shifted inwards to edge a rival for the place honors
late. BETTER BOAT was urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter racing into the turn and steadily faded nearing midstretch. GRANDMARY tracked
off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out three wide entering the stretch and continued evenly. SENORITA AURORA settled well off
the leaders in the opening stages, saved ground to upper stretch but couldn't make an impression on the leaders. HANNAH'S STORM ducked out at the
start carrying out LADY MIDAS well wide after the break, was collected to race off the first flight in the four path to the turn and soon gave way. LADY
MIDAS, carried out at the start, trailed throughout.

TIME FOR TROUBLE was settled between foes dropping back off the second flight racing to the backstretch, switched out four wide nearing the far turn
while being prompted to advance, was fanned five wide entering upper stretch gaining terms with the first flight, was carried out avoiding a drifting rival
leaving midstretch but continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm left handed encouragement. OBIWAN, off slowly,
was prompted to regain some position racing four wide into the backstretch gaining terms with the second flight, shifted inwards advancing three wide
entering the far turn to bid between foes in upper stretch while being fanned four wide, was caught in tight quarters momentarily leaving midstretch when
forced into the eventual winner's path by ARMANDO'S TEAM but continued willingly to prevail for the place honors late. ARMANDO'S TEAM, a step slow
into stride, switched out racing into the first turn to track the leader between rivals in the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail leaving the
far turn, then came through inside the leaders to challenge for command when presented an opening in upper stretch, gained a brief advantage midstretch,
then drifted out under left handed pressure crossing into the path of the top pair but failed to contain those rivals late. BEE MAJOR, in touch with the
pacesetter from the outset prompting that rival's pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes on the far turn into upper stretch and gave
way entering the lane. ANDREW THE BULL, urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail into the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes racing into the
far turn and gave way leaving midstretch. MOZANO angled to the inside in early stages tracking off the first flight for five furlongs and steadily faded nearing
upper stretch. GEOGRAPHY tracked the leaders three deep in second flight racing to the backstretch and gave way after a half. BUC'S INVESTMINT was
settled last outside foes racing to the backstretch and trailed the field into the stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

YOU'RE THE BEST, bumped at the start, was collected, then angled to the inside racing through the backstretch while being prompted to advance inside
foes racing into the turn, took over nearing upper stretch while shifting a bit off the rail but held sway on a safe margin to the end under firm right handed
encouragement. BAHAMIAN MOON broke readily, forced the pace three wide through the backstretch into the turn, couldn't match the winner after a half
but continued with interest to prove best of the others. DAWNDETTI ducked out at the start, was righted to track off the first flight outside foes racing through
the backstretch, angled inwards entering the bend, shifted to the rail nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to improve position.
RACHEL'S WISH broke inwards bumping the eventual winner at the start, was settled between foes racing to the turn and gained some position in the
closing stages while failing to prove a serious threat. BROOKSIDE BELLE was rated out of striking distance along the inside racing to the turn and proved
no threat. DUDES LAWYER, urged to dispute the pace inside foes through the backstretch, gave way between rivals entering the turn. SENA THE

JOY CITY broke readily to gain a forward placing along the inside in the opening stages, switched outside a rival on the first turn while moving to prompt that
foe's pace racing into the backstretch, pressed the issue, then took over leaving the far turn and made the balance of the pace under steady right handed
pressure. GOT FASHION was hustled to the lead while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, set the pace on a narrow margin through the
backstretch, dueled for command inside the eventual winner racing into the far turn, couldn't contain that foe in the drive but continued with interest to
prevail for the place honors. MR. WHO, was caught four wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to a contending position, tracked the leaders as
part of the second flight, was urged to advance three wide entering the far turn but lacked the needed final bid. NO TIME TO YAWN, caught three wide
between foes racing into the first turn gaining a position just off the leaders, continued evenly off the inside racing into the stretch. RED SORRELL angled to
the inside racing to the backstretch tracking the leaders as part of the second flight but couldn't produce a closing bid. VICTORY TOUR, caught in close
quarters just after the start, was settled outside a rival in the last flight, shifted outside foes on the backstretch but failed to mount a serious challenge.
FEISTY KITTEN was settled in the last flight nearest the inside racing to the backstretch and dropped out early.

Footnotes
CATTALEYA RONITH, brushed at the start, was urged to dispute the pace outside a rival racing to the first turn, gained a narrow advantage to dictate the
pace between foes just off the inside racing through the backstretch into the far turn, shifted to the inside nearing upper stretch, then turned back a
challenge from DANCIN AT THE RITZ leaving midstretch to regain a clear advantage under firm left handed pressure. The latter, prompted to a contending
position while caught four wide between foes racing into the first turn, tracked off the first flight for a half, was prompted to advance four deep nearing the far
turn, steadily advanced to loom outside the winner midstretch but lacked the needed final kick. D FLAT WHITE reared at the start, was settled into stride
racing to the backstretch, split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position. VAN KHOZAN angled to the
inside early tracking off the first flight racing through the backstretch, shifted out three deep on the far turn, was fanned to four path entering the lane and
lacked a closing response. PRETTY PRISCILLA, urged inside the pacesetter prompting that rival from the outset to the backstretch, continued in pursuit of
the top pair into the far turn and gave way into the lane. BELLA SERENA, caught five wide racing into the first turn while under some prompting to contend,
dropped back early. AMERICAN EMPRESS broke inwards brushing the eventual winner, was urged to gain a forward placing three deep tracking just off
the leaders racing to the far turn but abruptly emptied out entering upper stretch. MERMAID'S TEAR was settled between foes in the second flight racing to
the backstretch but retreated early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
LADY BREANNA broke readily to gain terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival into the backstretch, moved to wrest the advantage from between foes
racing into the far turn, then held sway on a widening margin under right handed pressure and was taken in hand nearing the wire. QUEEN ROLLER broke
sharply, sped to the lead while angling to the inside, set the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, proved no match in the drive but lasted for the place
honors. JUST A BIT SASSY, reluctant to load, was urged to a forward placing three deep tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, then faded
into upper stretch. STATED tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening half, shifted off the inside entering the lane but had closing bid while
racing between rivals. ROYALBONNIELEGACY tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight and steadily faded after a half. LAPULGA
broke in the air while getting away slowly, was settled last to the backstretch and trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
