Footnotes
MR FANTASY established the top in short order, cut over to the inside route, showed the way, rated along and with KIKKERLAND in accompaniment from
the two path, was put to a drive cutting the corner into the stretch, responded and drew well clear. KIKKERLAND prompted the winner while two wide,
proved no match. HEYMACKIT'SJACK pursued the top twosome from path two, fanned out into the four path from upper to midstretch, went on to secure
third. TAPIFLY off a beat slow, albeit not the tardiest of all, was guided over to the rail well before arriving at the conclusion of the backstretch, went on to
save ground to no avail. GIRAMONTE remained stationed in the three path, was called upon for more in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, got
sent out into path five for the drive, lacked the necessary response. TUESDAY'S CHILD dwelt at the start, was slow to settle into stride, was sighted towards
the inside at the top of the turn, swung out three entering the stretch, ventured onward having trailed throughout. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on
the start of the race, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
DID I STUTTER prompted the pace just off the inside between foes, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, took over
command inside the three-sixteenths and edged away under a drive to prevail. MISS PEPPINA broke out at the start bumping BONUS BABY, then came
out nearing the seven-eighths pole forcing that same rival to steady, showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from the presence of a
pair to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, got collared just inside the three-sixteenths and kept on to
chase the winner home safe for the place honors. PRINCESS PINKY three wide in aim of the top pair to the outside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BONUS BABY bumped at the start by MISS PEPPINA, who broke
outwards, got steadied near the seven-eighths pole as that foe came out directly in front, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened. NICKY SCISSORS chased three wide down the backstretch and then three to four wide through
the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered four wide into upper stretch and tired. MORE MANGO four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired.

KENTUCKY COOL away without apparent mishap, settled into the three path, contended for the top as the widest of a trio for the majority of the opening
half, got cued up for the drive home, out-dueled BUSTINMYGROOVE and kicked clear. BUSTINMYGROOVE sparred for command from path two for the
opening half, lost the duel with winner down the lane, finished well ahead of the others for second. CONFORMIST out in the strip early pulling on the left, got
worked over to the inside route prior to departing the backstretch, was forced to fend off a pair of opponents to the outside for most of the journey leading up
to the quarter pole, left the dispute stepping onto the head of the stretch, saved the show. RUN CASPER RUN got sent over to the rail in short order after
bumping with BROOKLYN LAW, rode it to the end of the bend, was maneuvered into the three path during the early portion of the stretch, lacked a
response. BROOKLYN LAW made contact with RUN CASPER RUN after losing his footing springing from the start, pursued the pace from path two, was
moved out into the fifth one after entering the stretch, failed to fire.

Footnotes
MISS LIANA argued for the top from along the inside, rider holding something in reserve during the early going, had already extended the advantage during
the final jumps of the run around the bend when turned loose entering the stretch, drew out to what turned out to be its largest lead over the course of the
next furlong, stayed well in the clear. MOVIE SCORE got set up in the two path, kept watch on the winner, shifted inward in time to cut the corner into the
lane, got outkicked. BLUNT FORCE underwent a three wide journey, entered the stretch and got up for the show. DIRTY BIRD two wide onto the turn, got
sent out four wide exiting it, shifted one path wider late, fell short of snagging third. LEM ME HAVE IT gathered after breaking slightly to the outside, made it
over to the rail by the conclusion of the backstretch, angled three wide for the stretch run, had no offering. SUZ sparred with the winner towards path two for
nearly a half and folded. PERSIAN QUEEN brought up the back of the pack travelling two wide, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, never
made her presence felt. COVER PHOTO saved ground for the opening half, swung out four wide entering the stretch, retreated.

BLU GROTTO coaxed from the start, raced forwardly placed steadily advancing to take command near the five-eighths, showed the way in hand just off the
inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside at that station into upper stretch, took to
the inside straightened away and went clear under a drive getting geared down in the late stages to the finish. TAPIT'S FLASHBACK chased sluggish early
on growing detached just off the inside at the tail of the field, went three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors. DOCTOR DOOM showed the way early on three wide, got headed by the top one near
the five-eighths and chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and kept on to secure the
show honors. KENTUCKY KNIGHT four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, continued just off the inside for home and weakened. MR GHOST hustled from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and
then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from midway, swung three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CHAMBO coaxed from the
gate, led briefly when forwardly placed five paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn put to coaxing three furlongs from
home, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. EPONA RISING lunged at the break bobbling when meeting the ground and was away last, chased just
off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along near the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
STEAM ENGINE came in with his initial step, brushing with its next stall neighbor, assumed a prominent position, angled sharply over towards the rail a
panel or so later, causing the runner up to get checked and DARK MONEY, on the rail at the time, to be steadied, alternated between the right rim of the
inside route and the two path before cutting over sharply to the former at the half mile pole, bumping with and stalling out DARK MONEY'S momentum,
showed the way, loosely pressed, was coming up to the three-sixteenths pole when asked for more, offered up the desired response and kicked clear.
SOUTH AFRICA away well, got checked right around the five-eighths marker, the first time STEAM ENGINE was himself making his way towards the
inside, recovered shortly afterwards, underwent a two wide journey on the turn, was set down a sixteenth shy of the quarter pole, stepped into the stretch
and proved no match. DOUBLE SHOT saved ground for nearly a half, angled three wide into the stretch, rallied to be along for the show. DARK MONEY
remained stationed along the rail after the field had been sent and running, got steadied midway on the backstretch as the unofficial winner was being
maneuvered over to the inside, got going up and rushed up to the half mile pole displaying some momentum, saw that flash of interest peter out bumping
with STEAM ENGINE, itself shifting to the rail once more in the vicinity of the half mile pole, got going a few jumps later, was roused at the five-sixteenths
pole, cut the corner and came up empty. POSSETIZZLY three wide onto the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, lacked the necessary
response. SEVEN LILIES shied in making some contact with STEAM ENGINE after springing from the starting gate, raced three wide on the turn, swung
out into path five for the drive, had no offering. BLINDWILLIE MCTELL took up position in midpack, travelled two wide on the turn, was much closer to the
inside entering the stretch, backed away then was reported to have bled. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the run on the backstretch, in addition to
a claim lodged by the rider of SOUTH AFRICA against the rider of STEAM ENGINE alleging interference, the latter was disqualified from first and placed
fourth.

Footnotes
BOO WHO got bumped solidly at the start in a chain of bumps initiated by IN THE ZONE veering inwards, ranged up after the break to take command five
furlongs from home and showed the way in hand along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under light
coaxing at the five-sixteenths when under challenge to the outside, spun three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. LITTERBOX got
bumped between foes solidly at the start due to pressure from IN THE ZONE veering inwards, chased three to four paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then five wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued five wide for home and offered up a mild kick to secure the
place honors. BEATTHATFLEW veered in at the start brushing the near side stall, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to just get up for the show honors. SOPHOS chased six then five wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly and missed for the show honors. CAPE COD GEM prompted the pace three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and weakened in the late stages. MAJESTIC SKY got bumped solidly at the start
due to pressure outside from IN THE ZONE veering inwards and in turn bumped BOO WHO solidly, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and
then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and weakened. POLLARD'S DAY chased four wide
under a ride from the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch and weakened. IN THE ZONE veered in at the start bumping LITTERBOX solidly
into MAJESTIC SKY and in turn BOO WHO, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch
and tired. VICE KING five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung
six wide for home and trailed.
