Footnotes
CAT LADY tracked from close range early, slipped through on the rail to take over after six furlongs, and drove clear. A LOOKER prompted the pace, lodged
a three-wide bid between horses on the turn, moved inside for the drive and finished with good courage. STARRY HOPE dropped back after a half-mile,
rallied outside rivals in the five-path approaching the quarter-pole, stayed on her left lead in the stretch and flattened out. KISS THEORY loomed a threat
four wide between horses nearing the stretch, but could not sustain the bid. BLESSING MEMORIES set the pace near the inside, got swarmed from both
flanks after six furlongs, and retreated. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
JACOHARE vied along the inside of NONA RAC down the chute, took back leaving it to stalk that foe from the outside, rebid into the turn before assuming
command passing the quarter pole, then drew off in upper stretch and was driven home. SADIO lied forwardly placed four wide early on, chased the leaders
from the three path around the turn, forged show in upper stretch from one of those rivals while proving no match for the other, and remained clear of show
thereafter. PARMENIDES saved ground off of the pace around the turn, and improved position along the rail through the lane. PARTY OF NO chased three
wide, tucked to the two path behind the leaders into the turn, and faded. NONA RAC set the pace outside of JOCAHARE early on, cleared that foe into the
chute, showed the way into the turn as that rival rebid to his outside, but proved no match for that rival at the quarter pole, and weakened in upper stretch.
JIMBO lied well off of the pace in the two path before swinging to the five path in upper stretch, and failed to mount a rally. CITY GLORY lagged behind the
field around the turn, and was outrun. OXFIRE lied far off of the pace three wide around the turn, and failed to get involved before tiring.

Footnotes
CAXAMBAS CANDY moved up along the inside after a half-mile, got through on the rail to challenge for command after six furlongs, took charge under
pressure in upper stretch, and widened through the last eighth of a mile under hand urging. SHAFTESBURY bumped with STRAIGHT UP GUY after the
start, prompted the pace three wide, could not match strides with the winner turning for home, and ran on to hold second. SI COMO NO bumped with
STRAIGHT UP GUY after the start, raced in range three to four wide to the stretch, and lacked a closing bid. FIRST TASK saved ground and failed to
seriously menace. STRAIGHT UP GUY was bumped between horses after the start, and made no impact. DREAM KEEPER set the pace for six furlongs,
and gave way once displaced up front.

H P BIG HOPE stalked along the inside, hugged the fence turning for home to produce a bid for the lead inside of the leaders passing the furlong pole, and
drove clear thereafter. PERUVIAN DANCER lied off of the pace in the four path around the turn, gained turning for home to bid for the lead passing the
three sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by an inner foe passing the furlong marker. COMMUNICATION FAIL broke outwardly and bumped an outer foe at
the start, stalked two to four wide into the turn, shifted down three wide at the three furlong pole before bidding for the lead at the quarter pole, forged an
advantage turning for home, but was headed by rivals on both sides passing the furlong grounds. BARREL PROOF vied for the lead three wide early on,
then two wide at the three furlong pole, but failed to keep pace with an outer and an inner foe at the five sixteenths pole. PELUCHIN CHIN set a pressured
pace along the inside, but was headed by foes a the quarter pole, and gave way between rivals in upper stretch. HEAVENLY BLESSING vied two wide and
between horses, but weakened passing the seven sixteenths pole. EL SICARIO was bumped and pushed outwards at the start by an inner foe, and was
outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
AMERICAN MATTERS dashed clear early, rated along in the two-path to the stretch, and widened under a drive. DARK TIMBER moved up toward the
inside after three-eighths of a mile, could not threaten the winner but was best of the others. LOYAL LOUIE raced three then four wide around the turn, and
had no closing bid. MAYOR REMO moved in from the four-path around the turn, and could not gain through the stretch on the rail. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA
steadied inside DARK TIMBER entering the turn, and never reached contention. UNLONELY hustled up along the inside after the start, stayed on the chase
to the top of the stretch, and tired. STARSHIP MOZART dropped far back after breaking slowly, was pulled up in the stretch, and walked off.

Footnotes
DEM A WONDER got wrangled back to midpack under a snug hold down the backstretch, commenced a three wide rally at the five sixteenths pole, bid
turning for home before forging an advantage passing the furlong grounds, and safely held to the wire. PINK FIZZ lied off of the pace in the four path, gained
at the five sixteenths pole following DEM A WONDER's rally, but hung on his left lead through the lane while inching closer to that foe, drifted outwards
while attempting a bid at the sixteenth marker before drifting back inwards from right-handed encouragement, and failed to reach the leader. SHE'S
CLASSY set the pace along the inside, dug in through upper stretch, but was headed passing the furlong pole, and yielded late. MISS ITALY lied far off of
the pace two wide around the turn, and improved without threatening. TIME'S ON MY SIDE prompted the pace two wide, but was outkicked by outer foes
turning for home, and gave way thereafter. BETWEEN DREAMS was outrun along the inside. LIFECHANGINGEVENT stalked from the two path behind the
leaders around the turn, but weakened while drifting out turning for home, and stopped.

LEGAL DEAL vied inside LONG BLADE and MUSTANG CAT into the turn, came past the three-sixteenths well off the rail and facing outside pressure from
the latter and WHYRUAWESOME, had the rider drop the whip past the eighth-pole, and held on determinedly. WHYRUAWESOME bumped with MILES
AHEAD after the start, advanced around the turn while moving out five wide, loomed outside LEGAL DEAL and MUSTANG CAT appearing poised to go by
through the furlong grounds, but was outfinished. MUSTANG CAT pressed the pace outside for three-eighths of a mile, battled between LEGAL DEAL and
WHYRUAWESOME through a long drive, and weakened late. MILES AHEAD got jostled around between LONG BLADE and WHYRUAWESOME and
shuffled back just after the start, moved off the inside at the back around the turn, and gained belatedly on the far outside. LONG BLADE bumped lightly
with MILES AHEAD coming out, contested the early pace between rivals, and weakened approaching the quarter-pole.

Footnotes
SUBSIDIARY stalked two wide, bid for the lead passing the three sixteenths pole sparking a duel, got herded a path outwards in upper stretch before
forging a narrow advantage at the furlong grounds, and held gamely to the wire. BAHAMIAN GIRL set the pace along the inside, shifted a few paths
outwards in upper stretch to engage SUBSIDIARY as that foe made a bid, got headed by that rival at the furlong marker, battled on gamely, flopped back to
her left lead with a sixteenth to go, but was denied reachieving even terms. BEAST OF WILDWOOD chased along the inside, but lacked a kick in upper
stretch to produce a bid inside of the dueling leaders, then held show to the wire. DONT GET SMART lied off of the pace four wide, but hung on her left lead
through the lane and failed to make a bid. BROOKES ALL MINE tracked from midpack three wide, held position through upper stretch, but weakened late,
then was vanned off after galloping out. SASSY JUSTICE lied off of the pace two wide, but came under a drive into the turn, and failed to respond. GRAN
ETIQUETA was outrun. SOCIALLY ASTRAY saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail.

Footnotes
SWEET PEARL was never far back, rallied three wide between horses coming to the quarter-pole, wrested command outside CHEVALITA in upper stretch
and edged away under pressure. SUNNY ISLE BEACH bumped with COWORTH PARK at the start, saved ground behind the leaders for six furlongs,
switched out with aim outside SWEET PEARL into the lane, could not reach that one and went well clear of the others. CHEVELITA bumped with
COWORTH PARK at the start, was nursed along on a short lead inside for six furlongs, and weakened into the stretch. SEXY DREAM pressed the early
pace three then four wide, and faded after six furlongs. CRYSTAL COAST stayed close early, put in a mild bid between horses two wide on the turn, and
was empty into the stretch. COWORTH PARK was bumped between horses at the start, and could not reach contention.

Footnotes
ONE NIGHT STAND tracked from midpack along the inside, slipped inside of a pair of foes at the five sixteenths marker when commencing rally, sustained
his bid to threaten inside of the leader at the furlong pole, and drove clear thereafter. HARDLY SOCIAL got a bit antsy waiting for the last horse to load,
stalked four wide, bid for the lead into the turn, drew off in hand approaching the three furlong pole, maintained a clear margin turning for home, but offered
little resistance to ONE NIGHT STAND's rail bid passing the furlong pole. I'M A COCO PEBBLES lied forwardly placed two wide, rushed to attempt to vie
between the leaders passing the five furlong pole, but was pinched between those rivals at the half mile pole, steadied back to midpack, took the turn two
wide before shifting four wide at the five sixteenths marker, and chased the leaders home. SAVED AT THE WIRE prompted the pace three to two wide into
the turn, put I'M A COCO PEBBLES into tight quarters when shifting down, then gave way passing the five sixteenths pole. QUID PRO GLOW set the pace
along the inside early on, but was quickly headed by HARDLY SOCIAL into the turn, and tired thereafter. ISLA BONITA failed to factor. SISTER IS DEVIL
was outrun throughout.
