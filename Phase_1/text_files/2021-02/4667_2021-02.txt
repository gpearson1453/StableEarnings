Footnotes
ANNANGEL (IRE) sprinted to the front, cleared outside rivals, saved ground into the lane, urged right-handed in the drive and held well. GYPSY BLU raced
off the rail up the backstretch, went outside a pair of rivals on the turn then four wide into the stretch, finished willingly three deep through the final furlong
and gained the place. LUCKY PERIDOT raced off the pace then took closer order past the half-mile pole, saved ground around the turn, chased the winner
inside pair of rivals in the late stages and was edged for second. AN EDDIE SURPRISE chased along the inside into the turn, exited the bend two wide,
chased between rivals late and was outkicked for the place and show. SWEET RAFAELA stalked the leader off the inside then moved into the two path,
continued two wide into the stretch and never responded to urging. POSH HOLLY (IRE) dropped back early, tracked off the rail then angled into the two
path, moved out a path leaving the turn and was never a factor. DIM LIGHTS chased outside a rival or two wide into the turn, moved out path around the
bend and came three wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BIG STORY prompted the pace from outside, headed rival past the five-sixteenths, dueled with VA VA VEGAS into and down the stretch, put a head in front
inside the eighth pole, put away inside rival then received a challenge from CRASH CORRIGAN and held gamely. CRASH CORRIGAN trailed the field early
then angled in and went between horses, entered the turn two wide, came out nearing the quarter pole and entered the stretch four wide, drew alongside
the winner mid-stretch but could find the needed late kick to get by. VA VA VEGAS set the pace with BIG STORY to the outside, was headed by rival past
the five-sixteenths, responded when challenged and fought back two wide into the stretch, clung to a short lead with a furlong to go then relinquished the
lead and flattened out in deep stretch. GABBY HAYES chased off the inside, went three then two wide around the turn and weakened. FERRARIANO came
away a bit slow, tracked the pace from inside to the stretch and lacked a rally. JEANNE B settled early outside rivals, went four wide into the turn, angled to
the rail around the bend and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
STAR OF AFRICA bumped by inside rival at the start, sprinted to the front and angled inside, coaxed along at the quarter pole, urged right handed in the
final furlong and inched away. SABURAI stalked the pace along the rail to the stretch, could not threaten the winner in deep stretch and stayed on to hold
the place. LAVENDER (IRE) broke out and bumped rival then was in a bit tight soon after the start, traveled in the two path, angled to the fence in the
stretch then shifted out late while summoning a late rally. Y NOT SIZZLE was in a bit tight between rivals soon after the start, tracked outside a foe or three
wide, angled five wide leaving the far turn and improved position. WIND TARTARE (FR) reserved in the early going from inside, moved into the two path on
the backstretch, angled four wide nearing the stretch and never rallied. COLOMBIAN GOLD was closest to the pacesetter early, asked at the quarter pole,
took aim two wide into the stretch and weakened. MADAME BOURBON stalked outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and faded.

HOZIER stalked the pace from inside, moved out into the two path then back inside on the backstretch, raced along the inside then came out leaving the far
turn, reeled in the leader and cleared late. FENWAY controlled the pace in the two path, led clear to the eighth pole, challenged by HOZIER with a sixteenth
to go and yielded to the winner. STAR SAILOR stumbled slightly at the start, chased off the inside, three wide into the stretch and went evenly through the
final furlong. EXALTED JOY trailed the field early, entered the far turn two wide then angled out into the four path and passed tired rivals.
ALLABOUTTHEMONEY reserved early from inside, saved ground to the stretch and weakened. CHASING FAME traveled three wide around the first turn,
stayed off the rail to the stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
SUPERSTITION stalked outside a rival to the stretch, closed in and struck the front in upper stretch, kicked clear at the eighth pole and was kept to task
under right-hand urging. OLEKSANDRA (AUS) trailed the field early, went outside a rival into the turn, propped near the five-sixteenths pole, angled out in
upper stretch and finished well to earn the place honors. CONSTANTIA saved ground around the turn, tipped out in the stretch and got up for the show.
GUITTY (FR) raced off the pace early on, took the turn two wide, angled out then raced between rivals at the eighth pole, lacked room off heels mid-stretch,
angled out and kept on for a minor award. LIGHTHOUSE chased along the inside the moved off the rail, went three wide around the turn, bid outside in
upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. SO MUCH HAPPY was away quickly from inside, jumped the track crossing surfaces early, set the pace
with a comfortable lead, showed the way with a diminishing lead leaving the turn, lost command in upper stretch, faded in the furlong grounds, bled and
walked off. AQUA SEAFORM SHAME stalked between foes then along the inside, saved ground into the lane, tired in the drive, was eased late and walked
off.

Footnotes
OCTOPUS showed speed outside TOBACCO ROAD then cleared that rival, showed the way inside to the stretch, urged right-handed in the lane and held
safely. COLOSI bumped at the start, stalked off the rail then outside a rival, took aim two wide but could not reach the winner while besting the rest.
LITTLEBITAMEDAL tracked the pace in the two path through the bend, kept on willingly in the final furlong and edged rival for the show honors. RINSE
AND REPEAT broke in and bumped leaving the gate, chased two then three wide while outside a rival on the turn, continued alongside LITTLEBITAMEDAL
through the drive and missed the show. TOBACCO ROAD showed early speed with OCTOPUS to the outside, could not match strides up the backstretch
and chased the leader from inside to the turn, remained along the fence to the lane, lacked room behind the winner in upper stretch and flattened out in the
final furlong. AWHITESPORTSCOAT saved ground inside to the stretch and went evenly late. HORSE GREEDY chased off the rail the dropped to back of
the back, entered the turn two wide then came four wide into the stretch, angled out further and passed tired rivals. SWAMP SOUFFLE was pinballed and
checked at the start, took the turn three then four wide and weakened. CONQUEST COBRA got knocked into rival leaving the gate, chased off the rail then
moved into the two path, raced between rivals at the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the late stages.
