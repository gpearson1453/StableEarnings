Footnotes
SHAKIN SILVER was reluctant to load, showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the
turn, shook clear at the three-sixteenths then shied out from a pop of a left-handed crop, shied out again under a pop of a left-handed crop just inside the
furlong marker then was straightened by the rider, switched to a right-handed crop under increasing threat late and held. FLASHBURN settled off the pace,
saved ground on the turn, rallied along the rail in the final furlong, closed determinedly late but missed while able to get the place. ANTIETAM ROAD
bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn turned into the stretch under a drive, moved out into the final
furlong and finished willingly for the show. NO QUARTER bumped with foes at the start, was rated just off the pace while inside of a rival, went two then
three wide on the turn, spun five wide into upper stretch under the crop, chased the winner into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick then just missed
the show. WIN WON DOBBS bumped with a foe at the start, contested the pace on the outside of the winner, vied in two path on the turn, was put to a drive
in upper stretch and weakened. SPECIAL STORM dropped back while taking awkward strides early, settled at the rear, raced inside to the two path on the
turn and failed to threaten. WAR TRIBUTE bumped with a rival at the start, settled well back in the field, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the
stretch and was no factor. KASENS TRAIN broke in and bumped with a rival then dropped back and spotted the front a few lengths, was hard ridden off the
pace, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. WAR ROGUE tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back
while four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and capitulated. TRUTH TELLER stood in the gate at the start and was off very slow, raced on the
outside while ridden along, moved closer with a half-mile to run, went five wide on the turn then came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
TAPTIME bumped hard with a rival after the start while also bumping with another foe then dropped back while in tight, went three wide on the first turn,
moved out early on the backstretch, advanced closer with a half-mile to run, went three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied on the
outside, closed fast to get the lead just inside the furlong marker, swapped back to her inside lead while moving clear at the sixteenth-pole and proved much
the best under strong handling. DANGER ZONE went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the far
turn, took the lead while set down into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner just inside the furlong marker and proved no match while just able to
get the place. FADED MEMORIES was taken under a strong hold while shut-off early, settled in the two path, was roused on the far turn, angled out inside
the three-sixteenths and finished willingly to just miss the place while clear for the show. OUTKICKTHECOVERAGE angled in quickly while going to the
front and shut-off several foes to her inside, was taken in hand and conceded the lead to DELLA FROST, was rated just off the pace on the inside, shifted
three wide at the quarter-pole, chased into the final furlong and weakened. MASKED MANDATE was bumped hard after the start, saved ground on the first
turn, settled well off the pace, raced inside under urging on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DELLA FROST went to the
front, set the pace in the two path, was challenged on the far turn then asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch and gave way. MS
SATCH MO was forced in after the start then bumped with a foe, went three wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace on the outside, was asked while
lugging out a touch in the four to five path on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch, was taken in hand while off heels before the three-sixteenths and
lacked the needed response. FLATTERINGAPPLAUSE went four wide on the first turn, moved in while towards the rear on the backstretch, went two to
three wide on the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch and was no factor. CIRCLEOFSOUL checked when shut-off early then became rank as
result of having her path taken, lugged out three wide into the first turn, continued three wide on that bend, settled on the outside, was through after a
half-mile and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off. TRICHROME dropped well behind the rest of the field and was pulled up in upper stretch
then vanned off. (Rail at 8 Feet)

the quarter-pole, kicked clear while still on his inside lead in upper stretch, switched to the proper lead inside the furlong marker, drew away under urging

pace on the outside, took the lead while three then two wide on the far turn, lost the advantage to the winner outside the quarter-pole and proved no match
while able to hold the place. CATINANDSCATIN was hustled to the lead, set the pace in the two path, dropped to the rail while headed around the
three-eighths, dropped back into the stretch and tired. RARE STRAIN raced in the two path on the first turn, settled on the inside of a rival, was urged three
wide on the far turn and failed to rally. DISIDE broke out at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled well back in the field, dropped from the two
path to the rail on the far turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN went three wide on the first turn, settled
on the outside, was urged four then three wide on the far turn and failed to respond. JOURDAN RIVER went four wide on the first turn, fell well behind the

Footnotes
ADEEB settled off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, was urged three wide on the turn, rallied to make an outside bid in upper stretch, drifted
out under a left-handed crop while taking a narrow advantage nearing the furlong marker, drifted in at the sixteenth-pole after being switched to a
right-handed crop, swapped back to his inside lead late and prevailed. VEHEMENT disputed the pace on the outside, shook clear while three then two wide
on the turn, led into the stretch then was put to a drive, lost the advantage nearing the eighth-pole, fought on well in the final furlong but missed while clear
for the place. HAWK TAIL settled under some urging, raced inside early on the first turn then shifted three wide, moved to four wide later on that bend,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely secured the show. HICCUP bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along at the rear, moved from the
two path to the four path on the turn and improved position. MR. OLD HAT broke out at the start, showed speed between horses then chased the pace,
started the turn in the two path, was carried four then five wide outside the five-sixteenths, spun six wide into the stretch and tired. MR. ELEVENTH HOUR
showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside, dropped back midway through the turn and came up empty. RONNIE'S REASONING bumped with a
foe at the start and broke a bit slow, was urged along towards the rear, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn and was no factor. SANGIO VASY
broke a bit slow, chased the pace on the outside, dropped back with a half-mile to run, went four then three wide on the turn and retreated. WHITE MIST
broke a bit slow, was urged along on the outside, went six wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and showed little.

Footnotes
OUR MARDI GRAS was hustled from the start, showed the way in the two path, drew off on the turn, was put to the crop in upper stretch, drifted out in the
final three-sixteenths while remaining on her inside lead and proved much the best under strong urging. SPEEDY DUDETTE was urged along off the pace,
dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, turned into upper stretch in the two path under a drive and finished willingly for the place.
SPELLBINDING settled on the outside, was urged three then four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while just able to get the show.
APHRODITES REVENGE tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went four then three wide on the turn and tired then just
missed the show. RESPOSADO bumped with a foe at the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, came up empty while three then two wide on the
turn and retreated. SILVER MAID was last to commence, settled at the rear, went two to three wide on the turn and was no factor. DIAMOND LADY
bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond.
