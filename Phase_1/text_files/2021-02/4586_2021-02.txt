Footnotes
FIRST STRING broke well, vied early while between horses early, cleared before a quarter, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to show the way
by daylight into the lane, enough left to late late while under pressure and drifting a bit. REINSURE in the second flight while racing outside, floated out four
wide when creeping closer turning for home, drifted in a bit late, steadily getting to the winner in the waning strides. BEAU BOOK fell far back after the start,
saved some ground in the second turn, two path into the stretch, staged a mild rally to be clear for the show. HOOKED A GOODWIN chased the winner
much of the way, had little left for the drive. SAMURAI SAINT settled off the pace toward the inside, moved out a bit turning for home carrying a couple of
rivals out, came up empty through the stretch. FACTION failed to menace.

Footnotes
MEISTERMIND settled off the pace and the inside, advanced four wide through the second turn, reached the front from the outside entering the stretch,
drew clear under pressure. WAGON BOSS forwardly placed while racing toward the inside, continued to save some ground into the far turn, traffic entering
the stretch, could do little with the winner, well clear of the rest. YOU SPLIT TENS away in good order, set the pace just off the inside, offered little
resistance to the top two in the drive, saved the show. KURILOV (CHI) prompted the pace from the outside, tired in the drive. BOBBY BABY broke back,
lacked speed, between horses second turn, failed to menace in the drive. CARTE BLANCHE off a step slow, trailed much of the way, three wide into the
lane, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. DETERMINANT remained always back. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT tired while racing outside.

RAVENS REFLECTION broke sharply, cleared toward the inside, continued to show the way turn under light restraint, maintained daylight to the wire under
steady handling while drifting out a bit late. BEST YOU EVER SEEN behind the pace toward the inside, traffic into the lane continuing toward the rail,
altered course to the inside as the winner was drifting out late, could not get to that rival, well clear of the others. SHARP ART last to leave, continued to
race in the second flight early, traffic upper stretch, rallied for the show, no threat to the top two. UNSCATHED pressed the winner for three furlongs from
the outside, weakened. RECOUNT in mid pack while in the two path, had little left for the drive. ROAD GAME remained back while racing four wide.
DEACON fell back after the start, trailed.

Footnotes
WEST SIDE GIRL unhurried early, dropped inside when advancing late in the final turn, got through along the rail to challenge entering the stretch, shook
clear under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. MAKING PROGRESS back early off the inside, rallied four wide out of the final turn, proved no match for
the winner, clearly second best. SOLEMN OATH within striking distance, moved closer in the three path in the final turn, flattened out in the drive.
FREEDOM BOUND prompted the pace from the outside, took over midway on the final turn, faltered turning for home. DUCHESS BUBBLES off a step
slow, trailed for over six furlongs, angled out turning into the stretch, lacked a significant closing response. AS REQUIRED narrowly set the pace along the
inside, stopped in the far turn.

Footnotes
FOREVERNOA broke on top, showed the way into the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, well clear into the far turn, maintained a comfortable
advantage to the wire while being kept to task. SOUTHERN CENTS settled off the pace toward the inside, saved ground when advancing in the second
bend, took over the runner up spot nearing the furlong grounds, could make little inroads on the winner late, far clear of the others. SUBIACO settled off the
pace inside, moved out a bit when asked for run midway on the second bend, chased the winner into the lane, weakened to quickly relinquish the second
spot, saved the show. SANTA ANA WINDS off a step slow, trailed early as a result, improved position while not a serious threat. CHARMED ONE four wide
through the first turn, continued outside, was four wide again turning into the stretch, lacked a response. FANCIFIED was finished after a half. SUMMER
LOVE chased the winner for five furlongs, stopped far turn.

Footnotes
TRASHTALKINYANKEE off slowly to trail well back early, saved some ground into the turn, steered out three wide late in the turn behind traffic, steadily
angled back to the inside past midstretch, rail bid late,, proved best. BUTTERED NOODLES broke in good order, dueled off the inside through a quick set of
early fractions, shook off the other speed when straightened for home, gave ground grudgingly when challenged late by the winner outside that one.
EARNER broke sharp, helped set the pace along the inside, could not keep up with the runner up in upper stretch, saved the show. ORO DE TEJANO
broke out and a bit slowly, void of speed well outside, four wide into the turn, floated out a bit further turning for home, shifted out widest when straightened
for home, closed well while too late. DEFLATER settled off the pace inside, moved out a bit for room entering the stretch, set down, came up empty the final
furlong. KATZARELLI back off the pace well off the rail, four out to five wide late in the turn, lacked a closing response when called on for the drive. SHIP IT
RED in mid pack while outside, four wide through the turn, brushed when in traffic upper stretch, failed to muster a rally when clear. PINTXOS off a step
slow, in traffic, bumped when jostled into the stretch, also lacked a rally. HANSENS MISCHIEF prompted the quick duel in the three path, backed up
through the stretch.

Footnotes
ALOHA WEST off a step slow, raced well back early, circled into contention while four wide through the turn, lost some ground to the leader into the stretch,
engaged that rival inside the furlong ground, wore that foe down under steady handling. MIGHTY MISCHIEF broke in good order, vied up front along the
inside, garnered a larger advantage turning for home, continued to hold the advantage past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner,
clearly second best. ANOTHER HERO behind the first flight, stalked the runner up in the two path into the stretch, had little for the top pair late, remained
clear of the others. ESTABLISHED lacked early foot, came five wide when angled out exiting the turn, went evenly to the wire while improving slightly.
SUPER CONSTITUTION in the second flight off the inside, three wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. QUALITY WARRIOR pressed off the inside,
faltered in the drive while remaining off the rail.

Footnotes
DEFENDER broke with the leaders, got clear in showing the way through the first turn, continued to set the pace the middle half, responded when
challenged far turn, dueled into the stretch, long drive to the wire, slight drift, gamely between horses. HOP KAT closest to the leader off the inside, went
after that one into the far turn, dueled into the lane, extended drive, also drifted in slightly late stretch, missed while between horses at the wire. TREASURE
TROVE last away, void of speed for five furlongs, began to advance along the inside second turn, challenged inside the top two late, in a bit tight at the wire.
M G WARRIOR within striking distance toward the inside, raced in the two path second turn, came up empty drive. COMBATANT remained back in lacking
a closing response. FAST BREAKIN CASH lacked speed outside, raced in the two path final turn, also failed to rally. MAN IN THE CAN broke with the
leaders, allowed the pace to go off the inside first turn, three wide through the final bend when continuing evenly, tired in the drive to trail home.
FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE TRAINER OF TREASURE TROVE AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP
STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
LOVELY LOU broke alertly, fell back off the early pace, three wide into the turn, made a strong move into contention by late in the bend, outside bid, took
over past the furlong marker, drove clear. WICKED STREET forwardly placed from the start off the inside, advanced and briefly challenged between horses
and inside the winner a furlong out, proved no match for that one, clearly second best. OLIVIAN a bit keen warming up, broke well, gradually cleared to the
inside into the turn, maintained daylight through the bend and into the stretch, faltered when headed by the winner just inside the furlong marker. LIFE OF
SATURDAYS off a step slow, raced back and inside, continued to save ground turn, showed some belated interest up the rail to be gaining for the show.
MY DAMS ATITUDE pushed into the gap just after the start, in mid pack along the inside, three wide into the stretch, evenly drive. SAILAWAY AND HIDE
lacked speed off the inside, three wide out of the turn, improved slightly while not a serious threat. RUN FEARLESS chased the early leader from along the
inside, began a steady retreat before a half. FLAT OUT GOLD in the main body while well wide, four out to five wide in the turn, lacked a closing response.
STORMY SUNRISE void of speed, trailed for a half, passed tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. ALITTLEBITOFSMARTY finished early, faded
before a half. MARCIAMARCIAMARCIA staged a steady retreat. MO DREAMIN broke into the gap pushing a foe inward as well, was straightened to race
within striking distance, stopped in the drive, walked across line.
