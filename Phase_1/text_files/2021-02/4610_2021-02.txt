Footnotes
OPTIMISTIC went to the front, pulled away, led throughout and proved much the best. GASPERGOU pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout,
proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. UNBRIDLED PULPIT raced near the back in the beginning, made a late gain, racing four wide and
got up for third. GOTTATAKEHIMTO raced near the back in the early part, moved up on the rail around the final turn, made a bid and was outfinished for
third. FLASHLIGHTSECURITY raced near the middle of the pack, saved ground around the final turn and finished evenly. PRINCE CARLOS lacked early
speed, moved up and went to the wire evenly. GOTTA A. P. B. hesitated, hopped at the break, racing in the rear and was never a threat. THIRSTY WIND
raced within striking distance and faded. ZYZACK pressed the early pace and dropped back. SOUND OF THE SEA void of early speed and showed little.

contention, dueled early down the stretch, couldn't keep up late with WILD BERT, but was a clear second. HALF AGAIN raced within striking distance,
showed late interest, but was no match for the top two. COCO TIGER pressed the early pace, weakened and lacked a finish. LEO DEL REO sprinted to the
front, drove clear and faded. MR. PRODUCTION raced in the back of the pack, saved ground around the turn and was never a threat. DREWZANO lacked
early speed and showed little. SCARLETTSBLACKJACK raced near the middle of the field and retreated to the rear.

Footnotes
UNWANTED INTRUDER lacked early speed, moved up around the second turn, racing on the outside, made a rally down the stretch and drove clear before
the wire. MUCHO MARVIN vied for the early advantage, took command around the final turn, couldn't hold off the winner, but was a clear second.
MIDNIGHT BAYOU pressed the pace, saved ground around the final turn and proved no match for the top two. MY BOOK unhurried in the early going,
made a mild bid, but was no factor. CAFE DU MONDE lacked early speed, raced wide around the final turn, improved position, but was no threat.
HALOSTAR dueled for the early advantage, saved ground and faded. OUR PRINCE raced in the middle of the pack, faded and was no threat late.
BAUDETTE BLIZZARD challenged for the early speed, raced four wide around the first turn and dropped back.

SY MICHAEL challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, pulled away down the stretch and proved the best. FLOOR GENERAL pressed the
pace, raced three wide around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. TOUCHDOWN JOE went to the front, drove clear,
saved ground and proved no match for the top two late. PRINCE PERFECTA raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. CAPTAIN ZIGGY
lacked early speed, raced outside around the final turn, improved position, but was no factor. R T'S DUDE raced within striking distance, came around the
second turn four wide and faded. PROUD REDEMPTION void of early speed and was outrun. ZESTY GUITAR had an awkward start, raced in the back and
was eased to the wire.
