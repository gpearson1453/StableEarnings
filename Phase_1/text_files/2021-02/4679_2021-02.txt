NAUGHTY PRINCE vied inside, easily drew clear on the final turn and widened to the finish under mild pressure. ROAN MOUNTAIN broke a step slowly,
advanced inside to get up for the place. SARGEANT DRIVE reserved outside the dueling pacesetters, bid into the stretch but tired. MAMAIGOTTHIS
chased between rivals, steadied along at the top of the stretch and continued well. ROYAL COUP saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally.
YONDERING dropped back outside and was never in contention. MY DANZIG PARTNER vied for the advantage outside for five furlongs and weakened.
BAD SUENO lagged far behind throughout.

Footnotes
BOAT OVER THE HILL saved ground throughout, squeezed through at the top of the stretch, continued his rally and was just up. MY MAN ELVIS dueled
inside, repelled numerous challenges and continued gamely to the finish. EARTHQUAKE settled behind the pacesetters, bid wide at the quarter pole,
loomed a threat but was outfinished. AUDIENCE OF ONE dueled outside then between rivals and weakened through the stretch. KING'S GOLD lagged far
behind inside, angled out in the stretch with some late energy. CAPE MAY STYLE well placed just off the leaders, began fading on the final turn. DONNIE
BRASCO forced the pace outside to the stretch then came up empty. SURFER BOY GEORGE dropped back early and was never in contention. KION
lacked speed and gave way readily. RAGE AWAY chased in mid pack early then stopped abruptly.

pacesetters then closed well while no match for the winner. MOUNT TRAVERS outrun early, advanced near the inside and showed good late energy.
ROYAL URN broke sluggishly, angled wide on the turn and closed well. WAR TOCSIN chased wide down the backstretch and lacked a rally.
PNUTBUTTER SPECIAL dropped back early, raced near the inside and gave way. DANCING BULL hustled along dueling between rivals then outside to
the quarter pole and stopped. KNOCKOUT KICK forced the pace three wide, bore out near the three eighths pole, bolted soon after and was eased.

Footnotes
LA WAUN quickly took charge to set the pace, opened up a comfortable lead, responded when briefly roused and was ridden out. ARK IN THE DARK
stalked the pace, chased the winner on the turn, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and held on for second. SCREEN SAVER was fractious in the gate when
loading the first time, chased between rivals, rallied mildly inside in the stretch and got the nod for third. DIG CHARLIE DIG was off slowly and steadied,
raced off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside and missed for third. CALL ME DADDY chased three
wide, raced two wide on the turn and tired. SKIPIN ON ORCHARD chased inside and tired.
