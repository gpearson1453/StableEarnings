Footnotes
LIL ALLIE DANCER pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and drove clear down the home stretch. AMELIA MADELYN raced in the back of
the pack, came around both turns wide, made a late bid and finished willingly. A J'S GRAND lacked early speed, moved up wide around the second turn,
made a bid, hung, lacking a late kick. MOSTLY AWESOME raced near the middle of the field, improved position, but was no factor. NANA'S JOY lacked
early speed, came around the final turn wide and was never a threat. FIANNA HILLS went to the front, drove clear and faded. SHALLOW RIVER showed
early speed, took the advantage and dropped back. CHARZEE BABY within contention, steadied, lacked running room and retreated to the back.

going, moved up down the backside, raced outside around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. CRIDER CHASE pressed
the pace, raced outside around the first turn, forwardly placed throughout and was caught late for second. SWANEE BEACH pressed the early pace, eased
back, came again, making a mild bid and hung. DEVASTATING BEAUTY showed early speed, saved ground around the final turn, faded and finished
evenly. OVERLY SWEET void of early speed and showed little. CLEVER ARCH always raced near the back and was no threat. AQUAHOLIC challenged for
the early lead and stopped.

Footnotes
MISS CHARLIE SIOUX broke in, pressed the pace, took command leaving the final turn and was going away at the end. SABER CUT raced within striking
distance, made a late bid, racing four wide and was a clear second. JET SWEEP unhurried in the beginning, made a steady gain, was no match for the top
two, but got up for third. THE COMPLETE COURT dueled for the early lead, drove clear and weakened down the home stretch. STORIED TRIP raced in
the middle of the field, came around the final turn on the outside and put forth an even effort. ELEGANT ORCHID raced near the back and was never a
factor. CRISPY CREED had a tight start, raced in the back, had a wide trip and was never a threat. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS always raced near the back and
was outrun. JENNIFER'S ARCH was an early factor, saved ground and dropped back.

Footnotes
DECEMBER SEVEN raced near the front from the onset, took command around the final turn, pulled away and proved much the best. WHY GOD raced in
the back of the pack in the early part, moved up on the outside around the second turn, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. MISTAKE
PRESENT pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. SMOOTH COLLIERY vied for the early lead, raced close
throughout, but lacked a late kick. JACK BE QUICK lacked early speed, racing near the back, made a mild bid, racing wide around the final turn and finished
evenly. DOUBLE COOL void of early speed, improved position, but was no threat. MR MAKEITHAPPEN raced within striking distance and weakened.
EBRIO went to the front, drove clear, faltered and dropped to the back. SONOMA CRUSH raced near the middle of the pack and retreated.
