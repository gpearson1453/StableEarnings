Footnotes
MARGIE'S MONEY angled in quickly while going to the front, drew off to a large advantage, raced inside on the turn, was set down in upper stretch then
thrown inward in an attempt to elicit a lead change, remained on her inside lead while put to a right-handed whip outside the eighth-pole, drifted out in the
final furlong, was given one final crack of a right-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole then placed under strong hand urging while exhausted on her inside
lead in victory. KENAI COOL settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path under the whip, moved out while gaining
on the tiring leader, drifted out around the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the place. MONEY INTHE STARRS urged some from the gate, was taken
up when rivals crossed in front from the outside nearing the five-eighths then dropped back, moved out while roused to gain momentum after losing position,
went four wide on the turn then five wide into the stretch, gained in the final furlong and earned the show but was never a threat to the top two. MELODY
ROSE lacked early speed, moved from the inside to the three path around the turn and gained ground without threatening. SWORN SILENCE was urged
along off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path and failed to respond. PADDY O was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went three wide on
the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor. ALTERED DREAM settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn, came six wide into
the stretch, remained on her inside lead in the drive and also failed to respond. AS FAST AS YOU CAN broke out at the start, followed the winner while
angling in fast from the outside, settled in second position while well behind that foe, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted out
near the three-sixteenths and faltered badly then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
UNEXPLAINABLE broke out and bumped soundly with a foe, recovered quickly then moved clear, set the pace while well rated on the inside, was given a
breather down the backstretch, saved ground while extending the advantage on the far turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, came under a
left-handed whip while drawing off outside the furlong marker, lugged in when switching to her inside lead while approaching the gate tracks inside the
sixteenth-pole, came close to the rail but was kept off it by the rider and proved much the best while held together to the wire. SIMPLY BEGUILED was
bumped soundly at the start, went two to three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along leaving the backstretch, went three to four wide on
the far turn, drifted on from the three-sixteenths to outside the sixteenth-pole and got up for the place. MEDIA MENDACITY went three wide on the first turn,
followed the leader from second, moved closer midway down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive and weakened then lost the place but was clear for the show. GALILEAS PROMISE went four wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside,
moved closer midway down the backstretch, came under urging at the seven-sixteenths, went four wide on the far turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the
whip and failed to respond. ROSE OF PARIS broke out and hit the gate, angled in early, rounded the first turn in the two path under restraint, moved closer
midway down the backstretch, was let out while inside to the two path on the far turn then roused at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the
whip and came up empty.

two path, gained three wide into the stretch, took over at the three-sixteenths then kicked clear under one crack of a left-handed whip outside the eighth-pole
and widened in the final furlong under a strong hand ride to the wire. MONEY BIZ moved clear early and set the pace, vied inside on the turn, was asked
near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and proved no match while able to hold the place. DAY TRIP broke last and a few
lengths behind the front two in a staggered start, was urged along on the inside, moved off the rail midway through the turn, was driven three wide into the
stretch, moved out around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. BREAKIN DAYLIGHT was ridden along off the
pace, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn and failed to rally. HE'S A LUCKY MAN broke a couple lengths behind the front then drifted in after
the start, settled towards the rear, came under urging before the half-mile pole, went four wide on the turn then came five wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. GOFORTHEWINECOURSE brushed with a rival at the start, chased the pace on the outside, dropped back while four wide on the turn and tired.

respond.

turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, dueled with the runner-up in the stretch and moved clear late under strong urging. SOVEREIGN CHANGE went to
the front, set the pace while inside to the two path, was asked near the five-sixteenths, dueled inside of the winner in the stretch and was outfinished late
while well clear for the place. DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER was hustled from the start, raced in the three path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the
outside, vied in the three path while asked on the far turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and tired while clear for the show. SCREENPLAY
was well placed just off the pace on the inside, dropped back on the far turn and came up empty. OKUDAH went three wide on the first turn, was rated just
off the pace while tugging hard at the bit, went three wide while let out on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, was guided out around the
three-sixteenths and failed to respond. HALEYS SAILOR went four to five wide on the turns, came six wide into the stretch and also failed to respond.

Footnotes
SILVER GALAXY lacked speed under urging, saved ground on the turn, moved out while gaining into the final furlong, dropped back to the rail outside the
sixteenth-pole and closed with a rush to win going away. PAPA BRO disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, inched clear
under a drive outside the eighth-pole, drifted out in the final furlong, led into the final forty yards but was overtaken while able to get the place. GUITAR SLIM
was urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch then moved further out at the three-sixteenths and
finished with good energy to just garner the show. ZELIG was hustled from the start, chased the leading duo on the outside then four wide on the turn,
pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick then lost the show. KEYS TO THE PALACE settled towards the rear
on the outside, went three wide under urging on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then quickly angled out, drifted out a touch near the
three-sixteenths before being straightened by the rider and improved position. ROSE'S GALAXY showed good speed and contested the pace, vied inside to
the two path on the turn, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. FAST VERDICT settled towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path, came
three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CAJUN UP was urged along near the middle of the field, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
FAITH'S RACEDAY tracked the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, was given his cue outside the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the
stretch, made a bid while drifting out badly from that point to the eighth-pole, fought on even terms with the runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly
prevailed under strong urging. FLUFFPOINT went clear early, showed the way in the two path through the turn, was asked for his best while challenged in
upper stretch, drifted out nearing the sixteenth-pole and missed while well clear for the place. THUNK bumped with a rival after the start, exchanged bumps
with another foe early, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was best of the rest. CAPTAIN NOBLE broke in at the start, tracked
the pace down the backstretch, dropped back while inside on the turn and came up empty. MISTER DON bumped with a rival after the start, was urged
along towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path and failed to respond. MILLER'S POINTE broke out at the start, was coaxed along on the
outside, dropped back while five wide on the turn then came six wide into the stretch and had nothing left. BABE REED was last to commence, exchanged
bumps with a foe early, dropped well behind, went five wide on the turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.
