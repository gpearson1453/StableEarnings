Footnotes
BIG CHEEKS broke a step slowly, ranged up to join the leaders three wide near the quarter-pole, took over outside CHARDRENEE in upper stretch and
drew off under pressure. CHARDRENEE vied outside WINNIPEG WONDER early, disposed of that one while being joined from outside by PRINCESS
MERIDA going to the turn, was no match for the winner past the three-sixteenths, and ran on best of the others on the rail. GINGERONMYMIND failed to
menace two wide. ANONYMOUS SOURCE raced close up to the turn, and faded while moving out four wide. PRINCESS MERIDA went up to contest the
front outside CHARDRENEE after a quarter-mile, and gave way at the top of the stretch. WINNIPEG WONDER vied early inside CHARDRENEE, got
shuffled back unable to keep pace leaving the half-mile marker, and stopped.

Footnotes
GILDED LADY lunged outwards and bumped a foe at the start, settled in midpack along the inside, swung from the two path to the five path turning for
home to be outside of the leaders, rallied to bid for the lead inside of the furlong marker, and drove clear late. CAFFEINE RUSH pressed the pace two wide,
bid into the turn and quickly forged an advantage, dug in in upper stretch inside of a pair of rivals, but was bested by his outermost foe in the late stages.
ALTA VELOCITA tracked from midpack two wide, then in the four path around the turn, commenced a rally approaching the five sixteenths pole to bid for
the lead turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer foe inside the furlong grounds while getting repelled by his inner rival. ISLAND VIBE stalked three
wide, then from between horses at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch. JUST SMOK'N set the pace along the
inside, but came under a drive while being headed by CAFFIENE RUSH at the seven sixteenths pole, then gave way at the five sixteenths marker, and
further weakened thereafter. MO ME MO MY took a bump to her hind quarters at the start, then was outrun along the inside. DIVINE MARTHA was bumped
between horses at the start, lied far off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and was outrun.

DONTPUSHYOURLUCK saved ground outsprinted to the stretch, angled between horses near the sixteenth-pole and finished gamely on the rail to get up.
BREEHAZEL raced in midpack early, swung four wide into the stretch and was up for second on the far outside. WHAT A TRICK was hard to handle up the
backstretch, settled down and vied outside R LOVE ON THE RUN around the turn, reached a short lead through the furlong grounds, but weakened late.
LADIES' CHOICE had the leaders in view three wide around the turn, had aim through upper stretch and finished one-paced between horses. BLUE
KENTUCKY GIRL was outrun to the stretch, and was going well too late on the fence. EASY ON THE SUGAR broke a bit slowly, raced two to three wide,
and posed no threat. R LOVE ON THE RUN sprinted clear early, battled inside WHAT A TRICK around the turn and into the stretch, and gave way past the
eighth-pole. BENEFIT ST was always outrun.

Footnotes
BRIELLA set a soft pace, drew clear of a mildly pressing foe into the turn, widened turning for home, continued to extend her advantage under driving
pressure from upper stretch to the sixteenth pole, and was kept busy under hand urging late. TO A T lied off of the pace three wide, switched out four wide
at the three furlong marker, improved turning for home, and stayed on to prove second best. MS V TIME bobbled a bit at the start, saved ground off of the
pace, improved past outer rivals turning for home, but was outkicked for place at the furlong grounds. BOURMA prompted the pace three to two wide, but
failed to keep pace with the leader at the three furlong pole, and further faded in upper stretch. POLISHED GEM lied off of the pace two wide and between
horses, got keen among rivals and steadied mildly into the turn, then never got involved. HARA stalked four wide, shifted three wide at the three furlong
pole, then weakened between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
NORTHERN vied inside COMBINATION early, shook that one off turning for home and widened under a drive. COMBINATION pressed NORTHERN from
outside, could not match strides after a half-mile, but held well for the place. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN broke slowly, recovered to a forward position inside,
moved out for the drive and lacked a solid final response. DR HARLAN saved ground under a firm hold early, stayed on the rail in the stretch and gained
only mildly. YOUNG RAYMOND was outrun early, shifted out five wide approaching the stretch, and made no headway. STARSHIP APOLLO raced three to
four wide, and faded after a half. MOON PISTOL lunged at the break and was away slowly, and never reached contention. KAREN'S COVE chased
between horses two then three wide for a half, and tired. BLACK PEPPER was outrun three wide.

Footnotes
LUDINGTON set the pace inside of a pair of foes early on, inched away from those rivals passing the five sixteenths marker, kicked on to a clear margin
entering the lane, drifted out through the final furlong with SILVERLY ENOUGH giving chase and closing in, but held safely to the wire. SILVERLY
ENOUGH lied off of the pace three wide, advanced to a four wide stalking position around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the inner pace setter
passing the three sixteenths marker, stayed on well to chase that drifting foe while narrowing his margin through the final furlong, but did not have enough to
catch him late. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK stalked along the inside, but came under urging to hold position approaching the three furlong pole, failed to respond
and lost ground passing that marker, then refound stride turning for home, swung to the six path entering the lane, and stayed on outside of rivals to claim a
minor share. COVE BLUE lied off of the pace two wide and between horses early on, shifted to the five path turning for home, but lacked a rally.
SEPTEMBERTEN vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but faded at the five sixteenths pole. SOUTH SEA prompted the pace three wide, but
was outkicked by an outer rival passing the quarter pole, and weakened through the lane.

YES THIS TIME grabbed the lead after the start, rated along through easy fractions, kicked away from GIRL DAD in upper stretch and responded to
maintain command. RICHIESGOTGAME tracked the leaders three wide for six furlongs, and finished willingly. HONORABLE raced forwardly inside to the
stretch, lodged a mild bid on the rail and did not have enough. MISTER LEONARDO saved ground near the back early, came widest for the drive and
improved for the last major share. ZIPPY BABY raced inside early, had the two-path around the far turn and could not gain. CHAO advanced mildly four
wide after six furlongs, then flattened out. GIRL DAD prompted the pace outside YES THIS TIME, challenged after six furlongs, got shaken off in upper
stretch and gave way. SEAZAN raced three wide early, and never got close. RUN-UP DISTANCE UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
QUANTUM LEAP prompted the pace setter while staying a path away from that foe around the first turn, stalked three wide into the backstretch after KING
CAIRO split rivals to bid at the six furlong pole, came under urging to produce a rebid outside of those foes into the far turn, dueled outside of GHAZAALY
through the lane, and prevailed under a long drive. GHAZAALY set the pace along the inside of QUANTUM LEAP around the first turn, then inside of KING
CAIRO as well into the backstretch, held a narrow margin from those foes into the far turn, attempted to spurt away from QUANTUM LEAP in upper stretch,
but failed to do so due to that foe battling on, dueled gamely inside of that rival through the lane, but was bested in the final sixteenth. TAITA stalked along
the inside, but came under a drive into the far turn, chased the dueling leaders from along the rail through upper stretch, altered outside of those foes at the
furlong grounds, but failed to make progress on those rivals in the late stages while fending off SWINGMAN for show. SWINGMAN bobbled slightly at the
start but was not hindered, stalked three wide around the first turn while being kept in the four path by an inner rival, shifted down to the two path into the
backstretch, then tipped back to the four path at the five sixteenths grounds to attempt a rally outside of the leaders, but only produced a mild grind, chased
the leaders home, and failed to reach TAITA for show. KING CAIRO tracked from midpack two wide and between horses into the first turn, decisively split
the leaders to bid for the lead into the backstretch, vied two wide and between horses into the far turn, but faded at the five sixteenths pole. PRAYER BOOK
lied far off of the pace while shifting from the five path to the three path around the first turn, took the far turn two wide and between horses while still well
behind the leaders, and was outrun. MUSK hesitated at the start and came out about two lengths behind the field, tucked from the four path to the two path
while at the rear of the field around the first turn, saved ground around the far turn, and was outrun. MIDLANER got caught in the five path while in midpack
around the first turn, but faded approaching the five furlong marker, and was done early.

Footnotes
BURLY BOY saved ground in the middle of the pack for six furlongs, shifted two wide past the quarter-pole waiting for an opening behind the leaders, dove
back to the rail in upper stretch, wrested command with a furlong remaining and edged clear under good handling. TROUBLE COFFEE raced in striking
range three then four wide to the top of the stretch, could not kick on with the top one but finished willingly. EMOJI GUY raced three wide around the turns,
and offered a mild response to pick up the show. SOUPER ENERGIZER pressed AUBURN HILLS from outside, reached a short lead after six furlongs, then
weakened through the lane inside. MITZRAYIM steadied approaching the first turn, and never factored. MR. AXEL saved ground tracking the leaders to the
far turn, maneuvered out three wide to loom a threat with a quarter-mile remaining, but flattened out leaving the furlong grounds. ZIPALONG was keyed up
early two wide, and lacked a solid response. POLICY OPTION spotted the field a couple lengths at the start, and was outrun three wide.
THENORTHREMEMBERS was never prominent. MAVERICK KITTEN was a step slow to begin, and was always far back. ALASTOR was outrun toward
the inside. AUBURN HILLS cleared inside with the early lead, got overhauled after six furlongs and folded up. RUN-UP DISTANCE UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
CHOCOLATE BAR trailed along the inside, shifted off of the rail turning for home before splitting foes five wide in upper stretch, produced a good kick, and
rallied outside of foes through the final furlong to get up at the wire. DREAMS OF TOMORROW prompted the pace two wide, tugged to vie while being
guided to the four path around the first turn, settled and was maneuvered back to the two path down the backstretch, vied around the far turn, then from
between horses into the lane as TULFARRIS (GB) produced a bid, lugged out in midstretch under left handed urging while sustaining the duel, forged a very
narrow advantage at the sixteenth marker, lugged out again in the late stages, and was nailed on the wire by an outer rallying foe. TULFARRIS (GB) was
last away, tracked from midpack three wide while in the four path around the first turn, tugged mildly to a stalking position into the backstretch, inched closer
around the far turn to make a three wide bid for the lead turning for home, dueled while being herded outwards twice by DREAMS OF TOMORROW through
the final furlong, then failed to reach that foe while getting outkicked by an outer rival approaching the wire. KAUFY BEAN brushed the gate mildly at the
start, rushed to set the pace along the inside, dug in inside of a pair of foes in upper stretch, but gave way late. BRIEFCASE BULLY saved ground off of the
pace, shifted off of the rail in upper stretch, chased the leaders through the lane, but was outkicked at the sixteenth marker, then lost her path in the late
stages as TULFARRIS (GB) got herded outwards. SOUPER WATSON stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid before fading.
RONITHELIMODRIVER tracked from midpack two wide around both turns, shifted four wide in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. LAKE NAKURU lied off of
the pace two to three wide around both turns, got floated six wide in upper stretch, and faded.

Footnotes
QUEEN NEKIA moved inside unhurried around the first turn, began to gather momentum along the rail midway on the far turn, steadied slightly but got
through inside a tiring GIBBERISH coming to the top of the stretch, battled inside ERES TU and edged away under a drive. ERES TU was allowed to settle
off the pace, moved swiftly to seize the lead four wide just after completing six furlongs, dueled outside QUEEN NEKIA staying on her left lead and was
outfinished while clearly second best. BAJAN GIRL sat behind the dueling leaders in the clear, came under a ride three wide on the far turn, got out-moved
by ERES TU coming to the quarter-pole, floated out to the four-path and ran on well enough to get the show. GIBBERISH hustled through to contest the
early lead, dueled inside MRS. DANVERS for six furlongs, and drifted to the two-path as the winner ran by to her inside at the top of the lane. MRS.
DANVERS moved in from the four-path vying outside GIBBERISH on the first turn, continued head and head for six furlongs, and folded approaching the
stretch. HALLAWALLAH raced three to four wide throughout, and was no factor. HIGH REGARD broke a step slowly, saved ground and was finished before
reaching the stretch. DREAM MARIE dropped far back after six furlongs, and jogged in.

Footnotes
ALL GOOD rated off of the pace in the two path around the turns, smoothly tipped six wide entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes through the final
furlong to get up at the wire. SPINNING KITTEN stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the dueling leaders in upper stretch, bid at the furlong pole,
forged an advantage at the sixteenth marker, but drifted out late, and was nailed at the wire. JUAN PABLO tracked from midpack two wide and between
horses, shifted five wide in upper stretch, rallied inside of ALL GOOD, but was outkicked by that foe while flopping back to his left lead inside the final
sixteenth, then lost his path and steadied mildly when SPINNING KITTEN drifted out approaching the wire. GUACO stalked from the three path around the
first turn, bid for the lead outside of KUNAI into the far turn, forged an advantage in upper stretch, but was headed at the sixteenth grounds, and yielded.
NINJA DUST tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted four wide in upper stretch, but was outkicked by a pair of outer foes in midstretch, and chased
the leaders home. WISE TO LISTEN saved ground far off of the pace, gained ground along the rail through upper stretch, then altered to the five path inside
the final furlong, and failed to reach contention. HANDSOME PRINCE tracked from midpack three wide and between horses around the turns, and never
got involved. KUNAL set the pace along the inside, then inside of GUACO around the far turn, got headed by that foe in upper stretch, then gave way in
midstretch. ATAKAN hopped mildly at the start, lied off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, trailed along the inside around the far turn, then
improved without factoring. MASON'S SONG was slow into stride and trailed the field around the first turn, made a premature move outside of foes down
the backstretch to be in stalking range into the far turn, but tired turning for home. POWER (BRZ) lied far off of the pace in the four path around both turns,
