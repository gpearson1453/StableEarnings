Footnotes
WISHES AND DREAMS got going after being put to an abbreviated brisk hand ride during the opening phases on the backstretch, tracked the ongoing pace
dispute from the pocket, was under a drive cutting the corner, with sufficient room along the rail corridor with which to launch a rally of her own, did just that,
slipped by the front runners to take over a little beyond the eighth pole, inched clear, then held late to stay so. MISS CHARISMA brought up the back of the
pack for the opening half, strung out four wide on the bend, angled into path five for the stretch run, venturing onward as the widest of all, rallied down the
center of the strip to procure the place. HEY IT'S TATI bumped lightly with CHARLOTTE WEBLEY in the shadow of the starting gate, displayed no lasting ill
effects from that contact and went to assume the top, showed the way spaced at slight distance from off the inside, prompted by the aforementioned foe
from the outside, was the first of that pair to have its pilot commit to a drive, this occurring as the half was being completed, shifted onto the two path at the
head of the stretch, inadvertently providing enough wiggle space for the eventual winner to work with herself, relinquished with slightly under an eighth to go,
weakened into the show slot. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH three wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path wider, made no headway in the final furlong.
TRAPPED N MY MIND set up in the two path, eyed the contested pace, swung out three wide onto the top of the lane under a drive, was forced to idle
along behind others soon afterwards, steadily got moved over closer to the rail from that juncture onward, managed to keep pace with the front runners
through it all. CHARLOTTE WEBLEY came inward after losing her footing at the start, suffering some contact with HEY IT'S TATI right afterwards, went on
to press the issue two to three wide, bid briefly at the three-sixteenths pole, flattened out then backed away.

Footnotes
REMOANE three then two wide in pursuit, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, dug in tussling
with the runner up before inching away late in game fashion to prevail. LOVE THAT FACE hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside,
took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared near the eighth pole, fought on to the finish getting shaken off in the late stages
while clear for the place honors. MIA CALIA chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and kept on to
secure the show honors. CRICK inside briefly, tipped to chase just off the inside until tucked back to the rail half a mile from home, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the late stages. MENZAMENZ five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked
three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. GRAPE THERAPY coaxed from the gate,
chased four then three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cornered four wide into upper stretch and tired. GOLDEN CELINE chased just off the
inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and made no impact. MADAM DEPUTY chased just off the inside under coaxing
from the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MAIDEN BEAUTY prompted the pace from path two, inched up to the leader on the turn, narrowly assuming the top as the third fraction was being finalized,
got called upon for more a sixteenth later, wrested away the advantage from BUYER'S REMORSE for good, was under aim from ICE PRINCESS for the
entire final furlong, showed determination to the end though to preserve the decision. ICE PRINCESS put to a snug hold by the pilot, kept watch on the front
runners within striking distance, got maneuvered onto the right rim of the inside route at the beginning of the run around the bend, left the five-sixteenths
marker having been switched over to stronger handling, angled into the three path entering the lane, chased MAIDEN BEAUTY, got staved off.
CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE tipped into the two path after the field had been sent off and running, loosely drafted behind ICE PRINCESS for a good portion
of the initial half, continued to pursue the pace two wide after entering the turn, was still being well-rated being moved to the outside as six furlongs was
being rattled off, fanned out into path five for the stretch run, made no headway in the last eighth. BIG BENNYS TRIBUTE saved ground for nearly
three-quarters, got sent out six wide from upper to midstretch, rallied mildly for the final significant slice of the purse. LOVE AND LOVE along the outside,
stalked the pace from midpack, was three wide stepping onto the turn and sent out four wide exiting it, lacked the necessary response. BUYER'S
REMORSE spotted along the inside route, crawled along during the initial stages, with the eventual winner in tow one path farther off the rail, still saw that
opponent yet tagging along after noticeably picking up the tempo afterwards, was on the verge of releasing control when asked for more approaching the
quarter pole, did indeed yield then steadily backed away.

Footnotes
MIA BEA STAR led early on before being displaced from the front by NICKY SCISSORS six and a half furlongs from home, settled two to three wide in
closest aim of that rival, advanced through the turn just off the inside to issue a challenge taking command five-sixteenths from home, continued just off the
inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. NICKY SCISSORS broke in at the start and was
corrected, ranged up shortly after the break and took over command six and a half furlongs out, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under
increasing pressure through the turn and got placed to coaxing when headed for command five-sixteenths from home, took the inside route into upper
stretch and tipped out to the three path straightened away, ran on to chase the winner home clear for the place honors. CHOOSE HAPPINESS chased
along the inside coming under urging at the seven-sixteenths tipping to the two path near the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kept on
to garner the show honors. HOLMDEL PARK chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths and offered no response. MISTY TASTE
chased three to four wide under coaxing from midway on the turn and made no impact. MAKE OR BREAK chased three to four wide coaxed along from
three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
ENTER SANDWOMAN assumed a prominent position after an apparent clean getaway, vied as the innermost of three for a spell before going at it one on
one with SEAHORSE D'ORO afterwards, from along the inside route, got called upon spinning onto the top of the lane, dug in well all throughout the stretch
run to prove best. STORMI CAT LADY rode the rail for nearly three-quarters, angled three wide turning into the stretch, rallied for the place. QUIET TYPE
guided over to the inside after bumping with SUPER BELLE at the start, continued to track the front runners from there until the end of the bend, swung out
four wide for the stretch, mustered up a response sufficient enough to lay claim to the show award. SEAHORSE D'ORO set up in the two path, fought for
several jumps from between rivals for command, before sparring with the winner from path two afterwards, kept at the task at hand until midstretch then
backed away. WHAT MIGHTAVEBEEN got set up three wide after bobbling at the start, contended for the top early before dropping back into a stalking
role, appeared to be done as the third split was about to posted, came approximately one path wider into the stretch, readily retreated while not being asked
much. SUPER BELLE made contact after coming in at the break, sat parked out four wide on the turn, tipped one path wider for the drive, gave out.

BANKER bumped at the start by FOREVER WICKED, who broke inwards, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four to
five wide into upper stretch, closed well through to the finish to secure the place honors well clear of the rest. SKYSCANNER chased along the inside under

Footnotes
AWESOME DEBATE established the top in short order, cut over to the inside, showed the way, feeling some pressure from the second place finisher out in
path two, was coming up to the three-sixteenths pole when asked for more, gave the desired response and kicked well clear, finished off the last several
jumps well in hand. RISK MODEL pressed the winner from path two, got turned loose for the stretch drive, proved no match, then narrowly saved second.
SHE'S A BLACK BELT tracked the two twosome from the pocket, came under encouragement coming into the stretch, missed the place. GLASS CEILING
at or near the inside route, sat within range of the front runners for the opening half, got switched over to a drive right around the five-sixteenths pole, tipped
towards the three path for the stretch run, lacked the necessary response. FOREVER CHANGED guided onto the rail approaching the end of the
backstretch, angled three wide turning into the stretch, made no headway. DOVEY LOVEY pursued the pace three wide on the turn, fanned out into path

Footnotes
PAINT MUSIC FOR ME broke out at the start bumping ACROSS THE CHANNEL, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch then three wide
through the turn advancing to issue a challenge swinging four wide for home, took over command straightened away, went clear under a drive and was
geared down in the late stages. ORPHAN HALLIE chased two to three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the place honors. BALLYDOOLEY (GB) bobbled at the break, showed the
way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
yielded command straightened away and weakened. GRECIAN PHAROAH chased four paths off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and improved position for the last major share. LORENZEN chased three to four wide until
tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. LOADED JOE
prompted the leader from the outside four to five paths off the rail down the backstretch and then from the two path through the turn, got placed to coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and tired. ACROSS THE CHANNEL bumped at the start by PAINT MUSIC FOR ME, who broke outwards,
raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. HEIGHT five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled four wide for home and tired.
