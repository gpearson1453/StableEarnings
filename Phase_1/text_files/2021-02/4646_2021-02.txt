Footnotes
ANOTHER EDDIE stalked outside a rival, bid three deep exiting the turn, took over in upper stretch and drove clear. BIG CLARE stalked off the inside, went
three wide around the bend and edged BIG SUMMER for the place. BIG SUMMER showed speed along the inside, showed the way through the turn,
challenged by rivals into the stretch, could not match the winner in the final furlong and got edged for second. WARRIOR LADY was closest to the lone
leader early, bid between foes at the quarter pole and flattened in the final furlong to a minor award. SUNSHINE BABE tracked between foes up the
backstretch, outside a rival or two wide around the turn and failed to find a bid. ALOT OF MAGIC tracked off the inside, took the turn two to three wide and
lacked a rally. GALARINA chased the speed from inside through the turn and never found a response in the final furlong. WINTER STAR chased between
foes early, got squeezed and forced to check near the half-mile pole, angled to the inside, saved ground to the stretch and had little left. SUPERSONIC
FLYER raced off the pace, angled to the inside, took a bad step past the five-sixteenths pole, remained inside to the stretch and never threatened. SUGAR
KISSES went three wide into the turn, angled to the two path then swung four wide into the stretch and was never a factor. ANNIE GRAHAM tracked from
the far outside, went three wide around the turn and weakened. HEMATITE dropped back early and angled in, altered out around rival then steadied at the
quarter pole and could not summon a rally after.

Footnotes
I WILL NOT stalked the pace in the two path to the stretch, reeled in the leader in upper stretch, put a head in front at the eight pole, urged once
right-handed and kicked clear and was in hand nearing the wire. CURRY had speed outside AUTUMN DAY then clear that rival and angled to the inside,
showed the way unchallenged to the stretch, could not offer any resistance to the winner approaching the furlong pole but stayed on well to prove second
best. ADMIRABLY chased the speed from inside, checked nearing the three-eighths pole, shifted out and entered the lane two to three wide and kept on for
a clear third. AUTUMN DAY showed early speed then dropped back a bit to chase the pacesetter, went three wide around the bend and weakened. BRACE
FOR IMPACT tossed head at the start and came away last, lacked early speed and lagged behind the field, went two wide around the bend and never
threatened.

Footnotes
CAPPER in range three wide while outside rivals, went four wide into the stretch, rallied and gained the lead late and held on over the surging runner-up.
WILLY THE COBBLER bothered by rival at the three-quarter pole, reserved in the earl going, came three wide into the stretch, angled out in the lane,
closed fast from outside and missed. MY SUMMER DREAM bumped both sides leaving the gate, was forwardly placed behind the leader, bid outside at the
eighth pole, led past the eighth pole but got outkicked by the top pair. ZOFFA moved to the inside early, shifted out and pulled between rivals from the
three-quarter pole to the seven-sixteenths, chased three wide into the drive, bid between and was outfinished in deep stretch. MOUNT PELLIAR broke in
and bumped rival in the beginning, went three wide around the first turn, entered the stretch four to five wide, showed a mild response in the late stages but
needed to find more. BROKEN FINGER cleared quickly and crossed over to the inside, showed the way along the inside to the stretch, clung to a short lead
at the eighth pole and yielded in the final furlong. COMPELLUS unhurried from inside, saved ground then moved out a bit in the drive and lacked rally.
LABOR UNION stalked the pace along the rail, was coaxed along into the stretch, lacked room inside at the eight pole and could not regain momentum
when gaining a clear path.

BLACK STORM settled off the pace, angled in on the turn then back out entering the stretch, rallied from outside and overhauled rivals. RICKEY B vied
three deep into and around the turn, dueled with RESTORING DREAMS past the quarter pole, cleared that rival in upper stretch, led through the lane and
was caught late. D K'S CROWN stalked off the rail, angled in on the turn, steered out in the stretch, rallied but could not find the needed late kick.
CONTAGION tossed head and was off slow to begin, lagged behind early, went two then three wide around the turn and finished well for a minor share.
RESTORING DREAMS vied between rivals into and around the turn, dueled past the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. BABY GRONK off a bit slow to
begin, settled in mid-pack, took the turn four wide and also weakened. ROYAL SEEKER raced off the pace, saved ground along the inside, tipped out in the
stretch and never threatened. STREET IMAGE vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals into and around the bend, could not keep pace approaching the
quarter pole and faded through the drive.

Footnotes
LINCOLN CITY broke cleanly but came away last, raced off the pace through the early stages, went two to three wide around the turn, angled out in the
stretch, closed from outside and got up. CHAOS THEORY was closest to the leader early, bid outside around the turn, gained command in upper stretch,
moved clear at the eighth pole, shifted out late and got caught. MYSTERY MESSENGER stalked off the inside, went two then three wide around the turn,
finished willingly through the drive and held the show. GHOUL (BRZ) settled early along the inside, steadied at the three-eighths pole, remained along the
fence to the stretch, shifted three wide in the drive and finished well and missed the show. SPARKY VILLE angled to the inside stalking the pace, entered
the stretch two wide, chased within striking distance through the final furlong but lacked the needed late kick. THE BLACK ALBUM (FR) dropped back early,
moved to the rail, came three wide into the stretch and made no impact. HIGHLY DISTORTED set the pace inside, challenged at the quarter pole, lost
command in upper stretch and weakened.

HOWBEIT bobbled, broke out and bumped rival, tracked off the rail, closed in three wide outside rivals on the turn, chased the leader through the drive, then
produced a late bid and bested the runner-up under a drive. CAPTAIN SCOTTY sped to the front, met challenger around the turn, cleared that foe near the
eighth pole, led through the final furlong but was overtaken by the winner late. SINGLE ME OUT bobbled at the start, traveled off the pace, raced in the two
path through the turn, rallied late and gained the show. SEE THROUGH IT broke out, chased three deep, bid outside on the turn, challenged in upper
stretch but flattened in the final furlong. OIL CAN KNIGHT bobbled leaving the gate, tracked the pace from inside, angled out and came four wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed bid. SATCHEL DE RITCHES chased the pace from between rivals, shifted in at the eighth pole then back out with a sixteenth
to go and finished evenly. PROMISE NOTHING bumped leaving the gate, raced wide up the backstretch, took the turn four to five wide, angled out at the
top of the lane and never threatened. ITALIANO chased two wide into the turn, three wide and outside a rival into the stretch, weakened and was not asked
late. FRATELLI forwardly placed early and moved to the inside, saved ground to the stretch and weakened. GOLDEN IMAGE threw head, hopped and
stumbled at the start, went three wide around the turn and was not persevered with.

CLAYTON DELANEY bumped leaving the gate, was rated just off the speed, went three wide into the stretch, rallied three deep in the final furlong and
proved best late. MR. BROWNSTONE broke out a bit but came away quickest, crossed over early, angled in on the first turn, got pressured past the
half-mile pole, inched away on the second turn, was challenged by a pair of rivals in the final furlong and yielded grudgingly. BURNIN TURF got bumped
leaving the gate, raced up close. TROPICAL TERROR trailed the field to the far turn, advanced two then three wide around the far turn and produced a mild
rally in the late stages. CARMELITA'S MAN steadied off heels while between rivals first time through the stretch, raced outside a rival early then angled in
and saved ground around the far turn and into the stretch, shifted out and went between rivals at the eighth pole and lacked further response. ONE FAST
BRO bumped leaving the gate, tracked the pace outside rivals, raced outside another rival on the final turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. KAKISTOCRACY broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, was in tight between runners early, raced two wide into the stretch, tipped out and
made no impact. TIZHOTNDUSTY pulled from inside on the first turn, settled into the stride after and remained inside to the stretch and faded. HAPI HAPI
steadied off heels early along the inside, saved ground throughout and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
MERNEITH dueled with GOLDEN PRINCIPAL up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear at the top of the lane and drew away under some
right-handed urging and strong handling late. GOLDEN PRINCIPAL dueled outside of MERNEITH into and around the turn, could not keep pace entering
the stretch but stayed on well to prove second best. QAHIRA chased between rivals then got bumped by inner rival near the half-mile pole, continued
outside that rival and two wide into the stretch, then finished willingly to gain the show. BIDDY DUKE attended the pace three deep into and around the turn,
chased the top pair three wide into the drive and flattened to a minor award. AMUSE bumped lightly leaving the gate, chased off the inside then three deep,
went four wide into the lane and weakened. PROUD EMMA chased widest up the backstretch, went five wide around the turn and lacked a response when
called upon. HARD NOT TO LOVE steadied off heels early, was coaxed through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out further in the lane and
never threatened. FAIR MAIDEN rated behind the leaders from inside, drifted out and bumped rival near the half-mile pole, saved ground through the turn
and tired. SECRET KEEPER broke out and bumped rival, entered the turn three wide then moved down to the two path and weakened.

SCARTO raced four to three wide around the first turn, settled in mid-pack up the backstretch, went three then four wide around the second bend, closed
through the final furlong and reeled in AWARD WINNER to get up late. AWARD WINNER sped clear and angled to the inside, responded when challenged
by a pair of rivals on the far turn, inched away in upper stretch, led to deep stretch and was outkicked by the winner. GOALIE broke out and bumped leaving
the gate, stalked the pace from inside to the stretch, finished willingly and gained third. HEYWOODS BEACH settled in the two path, entered the stretch a
bit off the rail, angled out in the drive and also finished willingly for a minor award. RESTIANY (GB) was hard to ride for five furlongs, went two wide around
the second bend, was floated out in the lane and improved position. INDIAN PEAK forwardly placed in the early going, bid three deep around the far turn
and weakened in the lane. TAISHAN entered the clubhouse turn five wide then angled down to the three path, settled at the rear of the field outside a rival,
exited the far turn three wide and made no impact. ENCODER bumped leaving the gate, stalked in the two path, bid between rivals around the far turn and
faded in the stretch.
