PERSEVERED rated a slim lead inside then came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole, drew clear leaving the five sixteenths, raced at the rail
on the far turn and was kept alert through the lane. YES MEANS NO rated off the pace toward the inside, challenged from the seven sixteenths pole but
dropped back leaving the five sixteenths and had to settle for second best. LUCKY PARK dropped well back from the early pace while saving ground, bid
past the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, then dueled through the stretch for third. PRINCE VALESKI raced well off the pace and
off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. BANK ON CANDY
stalked the earlier pace two deep while between horses, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, though, faded through the backstretch. ZUMWALT stalked
the early pace three wide, but drifted into the second turn and faded down the backstretch.

Footnotes
OLD LINE MAGIC entered the first turn in the five path then stalked three wide through the turn, challenged toward the three eighths pole, dug in for the nod
two deep approaching the top of the stretch and dug in under determined handling to inch clear of AFANDI, who moved to the inside and rated the early
pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and dug in gamely from that point, contested even terms closest to the rail on the far turn but
grudgingly relented later yards. SHARP'S MISSION entered the opening turn in the four path then stalked two deep, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, but flattened stride; a distant third. RAINBOW RIVER saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole then
weakened at the rail on the far turn. TRINNI SUNSET was boxed in and checked off the heels of Rainbow River into the first turn, gave chase into the
backstretch and rounded the far turn just off the rail. VIOLANE raced off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn and raced outside into the
backstretch, then showed little response.

the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and finished evenly while settling for second best. SEATTLE SAILAWAY rated off the pace about the
three path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved near the rail on the far turn, flattened in the lane but held on for third. NOID
saved ground off the pace the opening turn then eased slightly out into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path
of the far turn and flattened stride the final sixteenth. LET'S GET STARTED raced in the four path the first turn, settled off the pace into the backstretch and
showed little response. ROCKET COLONY raced well off the pace saving early ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and came through the far turn
about the four path, eased to the outside into the stretch, though, showed little more. PONTICELLO steadied early and raced in the three path the first turn,
moved to the outside into the backstretch and raced well off the rail on the far turn. YESIKNOWWHOIAM raced with the early pace two deep, gave chase

Footnotes
CARINA rounded the opening turn about the four path and drew to even terms nearing the nine sixteenths pole, had the lead entering the backstretch and
came under pressure toward the three eighths, rounded the far turn at the rail, raced clear into the lane and held well with steady urging. MOLLY'S GAME
rated off the pace about the four path, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn near the rail, took over second inside the eighth pole
and was eased outward through the upper stretch, but couldn't gain on the winner. PIMM AND PROPER stalked from the three path the first turn, picked up
the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and drew to near even terms midway on the far turn, but dropped back toward the head of the lane and
flattened the final sixteenth. LIFE IN FLASH stalked the early pace toward the inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but drifted while fading on
the far turn. HUNTER'S HELLCAT raced off the pace and off the rail and showed little response through the backstretch. CORY'S CUTIE rated off the pace
in the three and four paths and left the second turn outside, though, showed little response. SHALL WE DANCE was not a factor. LANESBOROUGH rated a
slim lead inside, was met at even terms toward the nine sixteenths pole, suffered a fatal injury past the half mile pole and had to be euthanized on the track.

PARTY LIFE stalked then challenged nearing the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms two deep on the far turn, took the lead leaving the turn and drew
off the final sixteenth. TWOBITSARIDE rated off the pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, angled out
mid-stretch and showed nothing further. RIGHTEOUS MAN raced well off the early pace in the three and four paths, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole,
came through the far turn about the five path, was carried out nearing the top of the lane and finished evenly to pass rivals. EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR
saved ground off the pace, bid approaching the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, but drifted toward the head of the lane and
weakened. RIGHTEOUS RENEGADE settled off the rail then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn still just off the rail and
weakened. TAKE TIME was rated off the earlier pace in the three and four paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole but faded past the five sixteenths.
NICALOE angled to the inside to rate a slim lead, dug in to the challenge of Party Life leaving the three eighths pole and contested even terms at the rail on
the far turn, succumbed to that one an eighth away, but suffered a fatal injury mid-stretch and had to be euthanized on the track. RAGTIME COWBOY JOE

Footnotes
DAZZLE ME rated off the pace and off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved steadily in the three path of the far turn, dug in for the lead
mid-stretch and widened through later yards. THESWEETESTTABOO steadied off the heels of No Stone Unturned approaching the thirteen sixteenths pole
then stalked two deep, challenged that one toward the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep at the quarter, drew clear midway on the far turn,
dug in to steady encouragement into the lane but was caught mid-stretch and relented the final sixteenth. CATTY KRYS rated off the earlier pace in the
three and four paths, picked up the chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn just off the rail and was along for third later yards. NO STONE
UNTURNED cleared rivals and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point,
gave up the lead at the rail at the quarter pole, dropped back midway on the turn and started to fade. SAINTE THERESE steadied early and settled back
about the three path the opening turn, raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and raced in the four path of the
far turn, but showed little more. COURTLY KITTY showed little response through the backstretch. ENDUROS TIGRESS was checked in tight at the rail
early on then saved ground. CAPTAIN ANNE saved early ground then faded past the three eighths pole.
