Footnotes
BINN GOODE took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, was hand urged from the quarter pole then kept alert to
draw off through the lane. THE CREEP rounded the first turn in the three path then stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole but had to settle for second best. W V ROCKET MAN rounded the opening turn about the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths
pole then saved ground on the far turn. CHARITABLE HERO saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn
and showed little more. DEPUTY DREW raced well off the pace while saving early ground then raced in the four path of the far turn. BLIMEY LIMEY raced
well back and outside into the backstretch then rounded the far turn about the five path.

Footnotes
SUNBRIDLED settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, took the lead mid-stretch and dug in
under steady encouragement to hold off WINNING SCHOLAR, who rounded the opening turn about the four path then raced outside into the backstretch,
bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and came through the far turn in the five path, dug in to take second mid-stretch and was gaining slowly on the winner.
CHARITABLE VISIT settled off the pace about the three path the first turn then gave chase into the backstretch, angled to the six path on the far turn, dug in
to take third later yards and was gaining on the runner-up. ORACLE OF OMAHA saved early ground then picked up the chase toward the three eighths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and flattened stride later yards. CLASSY CROSSING saved ground racing well back the first turn then eased out into
the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and passed rivals in the lane. PAGAN SMART took the lead
between horses leaving the three quarter pole and rated a long lead inside, came under pressure into the far turn and raced at the rail through the turn, but
was caught weakening mid-stretch. TRUE HEIR raced in the three path the first turn then faded through the backstretch.

C V'S CAMPFIRE rated just off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep past the
quarter, then dug in under determined handling to inch clear under the wire. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE drew clear and angled to the inside to set the pace,
was met into the backstretch and came under pressure at the three eighths pole to put Meet Ms Bobbi Rae away, but gave up the nod at the rail past the
quarter pole and dug in gamely to late stretch before yielding; grudgingly. DIAMOND TRAIN raced off the pace about the three path the first turn, gave
chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn just off the rail but showed little further. QUINCYS WAY saved ground through the first turn then picked up
the chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the four path but showed little more. MEET MS BOBBI RAE stalked in the three path the first turn and
raced at even terms into the backstretch, but dropped back at the three eighths pole and faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
MARIE FROM PARIE chased toward the outside and progressed steadily in the four path of the turn, dug in at the head of the lane to take the lead
mid-stretch and drew away later yards. WARRIOR EMPRESS raced with the early pace then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came in a path
past the five sixteenths pole, took the lead toward the head of the lane and raced clear at the eighth pole, but was caught mid-stretch and flattened stride
later yards. BARBSGRAY LION chased the pace through the backstretch then steadied in tight off the inside flank of Warrior Empress past the five
sixteenths pole, recovered stride leaving the quarter pole and raced two deep on the turn, angled out past the eighth pole and dueled for third later yards
while gaining on the runner-up. DIMITRI'S ROMANCE pressured the pace inside, dropped back at the rail past the five sixteenths pole and flattened stride
inside the sixteenth. UNKISS ME chased through the backstretch, raced in the five and six paths of the turn and ran through the stretch outside.
COMFORTABLE CAT gave chase toward the inside, was boxed in past the five sixteenths pole and through the turn then lacked room in the stretch.
UNCANNY raced with the early pace outside then took the lead leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the advantage in the three path of the turn, but
was caught while between horses toward the head of the lane and weakened. WAY AHEAD OF YOU chased off the rail, rounded the turn about the four
path then weakened. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Warrior Empress, lodged by the rider of Barbsgray Lion, for interference in
the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, though, took no action.

Footnotes
JACKLIGHTING raced with the pace two deep and took the nod into the backstretch, dueled from that point to draw clear midway on the far turn and held
well under steady handling. THORN OF ROSE HILL settled off the pace inside the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the
far turn then dueled in the stretch for second. COCKY WINCHILL drifted into the opening turn and entered the backstretch toward mid track, bid nearing the
three eighths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn but yielded second in the stretch duel. ALLOVERBUTTHECRYIN settled off the earlier pace
in the three and four paths, bid toward the three eighths pole then eased to the six path on the far turn and finished evenly. WEAVING YOU BEHIND raced
off the pace in the two and three paths, raced outside into the backstretch and picked up the chase toward the five sixteenths pole, came through the far
turn about the five path and finished evenly. ANOTHER MOVE rated a slim early lead inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point, but
dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened. LUCA'S DREAM was carried to the six path on the opening turn, raced wide into the backstretch and
showed little response. IRON HENRY saved ground racing well back, eased out into the backstretch and showed little response.
