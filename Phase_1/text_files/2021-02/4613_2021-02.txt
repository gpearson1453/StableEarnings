EXACT set a pressured pace along the rail, drew off in upper stretch and widened under a drive. BAHAMIAN RHAPSODY pressed the winner two wide,
could not keep in upper stretch, had the rider lose the whip near the eighth pole and stayed on to be a clear second. TROUBLE MAKING was bumped at
the start, raced well back three and four wide and was along late for the show. TREASURED NIKKY chased the top two from the rail while racing in the
clear, angled three wide turning for home and came up empty in the lane. SIP'N DIP broke outwardly, chased the pace two wide and lacked a rally. LADY
TAPATIA was bumped at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER was outrun inside. ELUSIVE EYES had only brief
speed three wide.

Footnotes
CALLMESENORITA lied far off of the pace along the inside, hugged the rail while improving turning for home, then sustained a rail skimming rally through
the lane to catch the leader inside the final sixteenth. DINNER AT FIVE lied close up inside of the pace setter, failed to secure position inside of that foe into
the turn, steadied slightly but was not put to tight quarters, slipped inside of that rival at the five sixteenths marker to bid for the lead, cleared away from
outer foes entering the stretch, but tired in the final furlong, got caught by an inner rallying rival inside the final sixteenth, and held place. CREATE A STORY
tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted from the three to four path at the five sixteenths pole to attempt a bid between horses turning for home, but
failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, sustained his chasing grind as that foe tired, but was outfinished by an inner rival in the late stages while
failing to reach the leader for place. LADY FIORELLA tracked from midpack two wide and between horses early on, took the turn in the four path, then
chased the leaders home, and surpassed an outer foe for a minor reward while not threatening the leaders. ALLEY TO CALVARY tracked from midpack
four wide, gained mildly in the five path around the turn, then chased through upper stretch before fading. OBSTINATE tracked from midpack five wide,
stayed in the six path around the turn, and failed to make an impact. LA GATA NEGRA lied far off of the pace two wide, swung from the three path to the
seven path in upper stretch, and never got involved. AUBURN set the pace while in the two path, but weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole,
and was eased through the lane. QUEEN ABARRIO stalked three wide, bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, but was outkicked by an inner rival turning
for home, weakened through upper stretch, and was eased thereafter. CAPTURED LIGHT stayed in the five path around the turn while at the rear of the
field, and was outrun.

FREE TO FLY set the pace in the two path, drew off in hand with the rider looking back six times for competition in upper stretch widened still in hand while
drifting out a bit late. DANA GRACE stalked the pace four wide, was no match for the winner, battled between foes for the place and prevailed in that duel.
BIMINI rated inside, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch, battled inside of foes for the minor awards and just missed second. WITCH
HUNTER chased the pace five wide and was one-paced through the lane to get outfinished for second and third. SAMMIE SUNSHINE pressed the winner
in the three path and tired in the drive. BACCARAT FASHION trailed in the three path.

Footnotes
PHILLY SPECIAL was jostled between horses at the start, recovered to stalk along the inside, smoothly tipped outside of the leading pair turning for home
to produce a three wide bid entering the lane, drew clear in midstretch with LIVIN AT THE BEACH in pursuit, dug in inside of that foe at the sixteenth
marker, and kept that rival at bay to the wire. LIVIN AT THE BEACH bumped with an inner foe while getting brushed by an outer foe at the start, tracked
from midpack along the inside while under a snug hold, got shuffled back while attempting to leave the rail around the far turn behind the tiring SIGNING
BONUS, slipped inside of that foe turning for home before tipping four wide entering the lane, commenced a rally to bid outside of the leader in the final
sixteenth, but was denied. HOITY TOITY brushed with an inner foe at the start, lied forwardly two wide, shifted three wide into the backstretch before
bidding for the lead into the far turn, forged an advantage around that bend, but was outkicked by the eventual winner in upper stretch, faded through the
final furlong, but held show. KAMALA bobbled at the start and bumped with an outer foe costing herself early positioning, lied off of the pace along the
inside, shifted to the four path turning for home, then split foes inside the final furlong to improve for a minor share. REMARKABLE SILVER tracked from
midpack three wide, but got keen around the first turn, then took the far turn four wide, chased the leaders without keeping pace through the lane, and was
outfinished by an inner foe for a minor reward. SIGNING BONUS prompted the pace setter from the outside, tugged to the four path entering the
backstretch, vied for the lead down the backstretch, but was put to a drive into the far turn as HOITY TOITY made an outside bid, then weakened between
horses around the far turn. JEANIE VEE set the pace along the inside, but was headed by a rival around the far turn before weakening in upper stretch.
ADDI was off slowly, lied at the rear of the field two wide, and never got involved.

MALRAUX set the pace along the rail, dug in and lasted. SEVEN GEMS pressed the winner two wide, slowly gained between rivals through the final furlong
and just missed. KANTHAROS' IMAGE stalked the pace two wide, tipped three wide nearing the quarter pole, rallied three wide and just missed. WHAT'S
INSIDE was pinched back soon after the start, rushed up inside, steadied nearing the turn, angled three wide entering the bend, advanced outside, came
four wide into the lane and rallied belatedly widest. GRAN MALBEC raced off the pace two and three wide and had a mild rally between. REAGAN'S
HEART was not a threat while racing two wide. APACHE BRAVE stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked a closing bid. BLACK
JET failed to menace while racing two wide. VINCENT WILLIAM was outrun inside.

STRIPPING was chirped at to advance to a stalking position outside of the dueling leaders into the turn, bid for the lead at the three furlong pole sparking a
three way duel for the lead, sustained that battle through upper stretch, then edged clear of his inner counterparts while under a long drive through the final
sixteenth. FIRST INVESTOR broke inwards and bumped BARGAINAIRE at the start, dueled for the lead inside of MY DESTINY down the backstretch, then
inside of a pair of foes at the three furlong pole as STRIPPING joined the fray, got headed approaching the quarter pole before reclaiming a narrow margin
entering the lane, clung to that advantage through midstretch while hanging on his left lead, but was bested by STRIPPING inside the final furlong, and
yielded to that foe passing the sixteenth marker. MY DESTINY vied outside of the leader down the backstretch, dueled for the lead between horses around
the turn, but was bested by both of his counterparts inside the furlong pole, tired thereafter, but saved show. ERV'S WENCH lied off of the pace along the
inside, tipped outside of the embattled trio in midstretch, and produced a mild gain to just miss achieving show on the wire. BARGAINAIRE took a bump
from an outer foe at the start, lied off of the pace two wide, and was outrun.

Footnotes
LAUDA SPEED kicked a wall in the walking ring and required examination before the post parade, bumped an inner foe at the start, stalked along the
inside, then two wide around the turn, shifted three wide to split foes at the three sixteenths pole taking away THE ICE BEAST's path in the process, dueled
between rivals before being bumped on both sides at the furlong marker due to the aftermath of FRIAR TUCK's incident in upper stretch, then sustained his
drive to inch away from those rivals in the final sixteenth. MAHOMES MONEY was off slowly and trailed the field into the turn, chased from behind the
leading quartet in upper stretch, tipped outside of those rivals at the furlong grounds, and rallied through the late stages to reach place, but failed to catch
the leader. WORLDS ON HIGH lied off of the pace through the early stages, gained outside of foes into the turn to vie for the lead outside of a pair of foes
while in the four path by the five sixteenths marker, held his path while taking a bump from THE ICE BEAST to his hind quarters entering the lane, sustained
vying position under a long drive before receiving a bump at the furlong pole as inner foes stacked up, then got outkicked by an inner foe passing that
marker, and outfinished by an outer foe approaching the wire. PALADIO took a bump from an outer foe at the start, lied off of the pace along the inside,
advanced to a stalking position behind the leaders around the turn, attempted to slip through a very narrow hole inside of the leaders entering the lane, but
lost his path when FRIAR TUCK shifted in slightly in upper stretch, got squeezed against the rail due to the incident, then chased outer foes home. FRIAR
TUCK set the pace along the inside, held an advantage from a pair of foes at the five sixteenths grounds while staying in the two path, shifted inwards
slightly entering the lane causing PALADIO to be squeezed, had his hind quarters bumped from underneath him in the process, bumped an outer foe at the
furlong grounds while recovering, then yielded thereafter. THE ICE BEAST prompted the pace setter two wide, was kept in the three path by that foe while
between horses around the turn, but was pinched back before fading passing the three sixteenths pole as an inner foe shifted outwards. BEASTER lied
forwardly placed two wide, but was done early. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN UPPER STRETCH, NO CHANGE WAS
MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

CHURN N BURN tracked the pacesetter in the clear two wide, seized command turning for home and drew off under a drive. SHAMROCKET rated back
inside, angled three wide early on the far turn, finished willingly but was unable to make a dent in the winner's margin through the lane. SMALL HOPE saved
ground off the pace, went two wide rounding the far turn and rallied between rivals to gain the show. FOCUS GROUP was unhurried inside, angled out in
upper stretch and rallied belatedly. PILLAR MOUNTAIN (IRE) failed to menace while racing two and three wide. BRAY trailed inside, angled three wide
early on the far turn and improved position. PREFECT saved ground in midpack, bid in upper stretch and flattened out through the final furlong. SCANNO
played no factor while racing three and four wide. DOVER CLIFFS set a clear pace along the rail to upper stretch and retreated. FORTUITY was outrun
inside. KING OF SPADES chased the pace two wide and was through early.

Footnotes
BREAKING ALONE stalked three wide, shifted two wide turning for home as the leader kicked away, chased that foe through upper stretch, but sustained
his determined grind through the late stages to catch that tiring foe approaching the wire. AESTHETICALLY set the pace along the inside, got rank into the
first turn, established a loose lead into the backstretch, widened his advantage turning for home, but tired in the final furlong and was caught late. LEASE
tracked from midpack two wide, got rank around the three quarter grounds, but quickly settled, took the far turn four to three wide, then chased the leaders
home. SUPERPOSITION lied far off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide turning for home, and rallied for a minor share. UNDER FIRE broke outwardly,
bumped a rival, and was steadied due shortly after, trailed along the inside, swung five wide turning for home, and stayed on. NAVAJO CREED took a bump
between horses at the start, lied off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the three path, and failed to factor. GOLDEN FIDDLE lied far off of the
pace three wide, then four to five wide around the far turn, and never got involved. MACLYRICAL tracked from midpack along the inside, then from the two
path around the far turn, and failed to factor. CHEVAL DORE stalked two wide, cut the corner turning for home, but was not clear of ANDRES EDUARDO
when shifting inwards, caused that foe to be pinched, then weakened through midstretch. ANDRES EDUARDO stalked along the inside, but steadied when
pinched by an outer rival turning for home, and subsequently faded. ORIGINAL TIMES REINSTATED UPON REVIEW; RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
