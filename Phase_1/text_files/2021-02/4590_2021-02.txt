Footnotes
APPLEWOOD raced within striking distance, came around the second turn four wide and drove clear before the wire. SUPER FACTOR pressed the pace,
forwardly placed throughout, made a late bid, racing four wide and got up for second. HONOR MY SPEED went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and
got caught late for second. FRONT PAGE raced within contention, saved ground around the final turn and lacked a late kick. ROSSLARE HARBOUR void
of early speed, raced wide around the final turn, showed late interest, but was no factor. SPRING RODEO lacked early speed, moved up and finished
evenly. DEBONNAIRE DUDE challenged for the early advantage and was finished early. SLAMMIN' MIKE raced in the middle of the pack and faded.
SECOND GUESS raced evenly near the back and showed little. DADDY BILL always raced near the back and was outrun.

SIDASTA stalked the leader in the early going, made a bid around the turn and was going away at the end. NEW ORLEANS SPICE raced within contention,
saved ground around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. NO NO NO went to the front, forwardly placed throughout and proved
third best. PALMETTOVOWMENOT raced near the back in the early part, moved up and finished evenly. MARQUEE MOMENT raced in the middle of the
field, came around the turn on the outside, finish wide, while putting forth an even effort. DIXIELAND FLASH raced within contention, faded and was no
threat late. SOONER SCHOONER lacked early speed, raced seven wide around the turn and was never close. TODAYISNOTTHEDAY reared at the start
and was never close. GEMODIXIE raced near the middle of the pack in the beginning and retreated to the rear.
