Footnotes
FULL DRAW chased inside then moved out a few paths on the first turn, moved back inside on the backstretch, angled out on the far turn, swooped by the
top pair entering the stretch, kicked clear then drifted inward and drew off in the lane and was geared down nearing the wire. TIGER'S SONG set the pace
under pressure from outside, lost command at the three-eighths but continued to fight back from inside, could not keep up with the winner down the stretch
but finished willingly near the inside to regain the place. MONGOL ALTAI lacked early speed, angled out in the drive and summoned a mild rally rally to earn
the show honors. TIZ VICIOUS had early speed three deep into the first turn then pressed outside the leader into the backstretch, took over at the
three-eighths pole and led through the far turn, lost command into the drive and got outkicked for the place and show. TWIRLING DERBY went four wide
around the first turn, remained off the inside and came four to five wide into the stretch and never offered the necessary response. JUNGLE ROAR traveled
three wide around the clubhouse turn, stalked outside a rival up the backstretch, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. WHERES MY COOKIES
showed early speed between rivals then got crowded and steadied a bit on the first turn, tracked the top pair off the inside then angled in on the on the final
turn and tired.

BIG BEAUTY stalked off the inside, bid three deep at the three-eighths, cleared and angled to the rail, kept to task through the lane and remained clear.
SUNSHINE BABE stalked the leader from inside to the stretch, finished well but was unable to threaten the winner. MENSA ON TAP shuffled back leaving
the gate, sat off the pace from inside, moved out on the backstretch, entered the far turn two wide then angled to the fence, saved ground into the lane,
angled out with a furlong to go and gained the show. SHOUT IT OUT set the pace inside a rival, vied for the lead then bore out near the five-sixteenths pole,
chased two wide into the stretch and finished evenly. AGATA pressed the pace from outside then vied between at the three-eighths, steadied briefly past
the five-sixteenths pole and weakened. WINTER STAR shuffled back at the start and was never involved. HEMATITE tracked the pace from inside and had
little left for the drive. WARRENS CANDY GIRL was unhurried off the rail, urged upon on the second turn, was impeded and propped past the
five-sixteenths pole, pulled up on the second turn and walked off. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SHOUT IT OUT FROM

Footnotes
ADMIRABLY chased outside a rival then between foes, took aim two wide into the stretch, challenged from outside and wore down the runner-up in deep
stretch. REBEL WAR set the pace from outside, angled in nearing the turn, led clear to the eighth pole and yielded grudgingly to the winner. OLD INDIAN
TRICK tracked off the rail, went three deep into the turn, chased three wide into the drive and went evenly late. HIT THE SEAM was closest in pursuit early,
angled to the inside, came off the turn two wide and weakened. GREAT POWER broke through the gate prior to the start, chased from inside then angled
three wide on the turn and weakened. LEPRINO stumbled a bit at the start, went three to four wide around the bend and proved no menace.

Footnotes
LETSGETLUCKY bumped from outside at the start, dueled for the lead from inside, cleared rival at the quarter pole and held well under right-handed urging.
CRASH CORRIGAN traveled along the inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out a path and chased the winner through the final furlong, could not
summon the needed late energy but held the place. THRIVE off a bit slow from outside, sat off the pace, angled to the two path, came three wide into the
stretch, steered widest in upper stretch then finished well and missed the place. I'LL STAND TALLER bumped inside rival at the start, stalked three to four
wide around the turn and kept on for a minor award. ATOMIC DROP attended the pace outside the top pair, chased the lone leader three wide into the
stretch and weakened. BOB DANIELS dueled for the lead outside of LETSGETLUCKY, could not keep pace approaching the quarter pole and weakened in
the lane. LESSONS OF AUTISM chased off the rail, lost ground into the turn, dropped back in the two path and tired. STING LIKE A BEE lacked early
speed, went four then three wide around the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
A NEW PEACE angled in on the first turn, stalked the pace in the two path up the backstretch, shifted three wide around the far turn, took command in
upper stretch then met the challenge from GOODTINGSCOMINPINK in the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed. GOODTINGSCOMINPINK allowed to
settle from inside, angled three wide around the second bend, steered out further in the stretch, rallied and drew alongside the leader but could not get by.
SUGAR PICKEL brushed from inside at the start, was unhurried in the beginning while outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and was within
striking distance through the final furlong but needed to find more late. ZUCCHERA raced at the back of the field along the inside, entered the stretch two
wide and passed tired rivals. GALLANTLYSTREAMING (IRE) brushed with outside rival at the start, off the pace through the first turn, closed in up the
backstretch, bid outside on the far turn, gained command at the quarter pole, lost the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. SOPHIE ANTOINETTE
sprinted to the front and gained a clear advantage, showed the way unchallenged to the far turn. TIZ A UNICORN chased off the inside early then angled to
the rail, saved ground into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
WILD ARCH away quickly from the gate, showed early speed between rivals then chased OUR BONNIE LASS up the backstretch, took aim two wide into
the stretch, drew alongside the leader mid-stretch, took over late and was all out to stave off the runner-up. BANDEENA vied for the lead from inside then
dropped back to a stalking position, angled out around the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, rallied outside the top pair and missed. OUR BONNIE
LASS bobbled at the start, vied three deep then cleared on the backstretch, angled to the inside and cut the corner into the stretch, led through the lane
then got headed at the sixteenth pole and yielded to the top pair. KEEP IT CLASSY steadied into the first turn, went between rivals into the far turn, cleared
those foes and angled to the inside, then finished willingly and earned a minor share. COSMIC COWGIRL fractious in the gate, steadied into the first turn
then angled to the inside, went two wide into the second bend, angled five wide and could not rally. SPOKEN WITH A KISS stalked outside a rival, floated
out by rival into the stretch, had the rider lose his whip at the eighth pole and was ridden out. HAUTE TIME settled off the rail, went three wide into the drive
and made no impact. SWEET MEG went two to three wide around the clubhouse turn, angled in and saved ground into the stretch and came up empty. I'M
ALL THE JEDI bobbled at the start, checked into the first turn, raced off the rail, gave no response when asked, was eased on the second bend, crossed the
wire and walked off.
