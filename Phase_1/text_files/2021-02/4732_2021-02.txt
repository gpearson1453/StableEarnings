held late over the runner-up. HOLY EMPEROR bumped leaving the gate, settled in the two path, went between runners in upper stretch and was gaining
outside the leader to the wire. MY INDY content to settled at the back along the inside, moved out a path on the backstretch, came three wide into the
stretch then angled out and gained the show. COMMANDING CHIEF tucked inside on the first turn, waited behind a rival on the second bend, lacked room
at various points in the stretch then gained a clear path and finished willingly. MONGOLIAN KINGDOM broke out and bumped rival at the start, stalked the
leader on the inside then two wide around the first turn, continued in the two path to the stretch, moved out a bit in upper stretch, drifted out some and never

Footnotes
PAIGE RUNNER stalked outside the early speed, bid alongside nearing the three-eighths, took over around the turn and cleared rival at the quarter pole,
powered away in the stretch under some urging and was ridden out in the final sixteenth. MISS KITNESS sped clear early, set the pace along the rail,
challenged at the three-eighths pole, lost command around the turn, could not go on with the winner into the stretch but held the place. LULUMARU bumped
leaving the gate, chased the from inside then moved into the two path around the first turn, went between foes at the seven-sixteenths, came three wide into
the stretch, drifted out and gained the show. MONGOLIAN WINDOW tossed head and was off slow, saved ground into the lane and kept on for a minor
share. NOBLE CONTESSA bumped with inner rival at the start, forwardly placed early from inside, saved ground then moved into the two path leaving the
far turn and weakened. RED BUNTING (IRE) chased off the rail throughout, came four wide into the stretch and had little left. TIZ WONDERFULLY threw
head at the start to come away slow, pulled a bit behind rivals on the first turn, went three wide into the stretch and was never a factor. FOLLOWING AN
INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT TIZ WONDERFULLY WAS NOT AFFORDED THE OPPURTUNITY FOR A FAIR START AND THEREFOR IS
CONSIDERED A NON-STARTER.

Footnotes
ROBIN'S LEGACY fought for the lead into the first turn from inside, cleared foes around the bend, showed the way along the inside into the drive, continued
clear under strong urging and held well. HARD METAL angled to the inside early, chased inside then two to three wide leaving the far turn, finished willingly
and earned the place honors. ROYAL ORB had early speed between rivals into the first turn then chased the speed in the two path to the stretch and got
edged for the place. SHORT RIB broke out and bumped rival, went five deep into the first turn, remained five wide through that bend, traveled four wide
around the second turn and kept on for a minor award. PAISANO went three deep into the first turn, chased the speed, three then four wide into the stretch
and could not rally. BOLU came in and bumped rival midway around the first turn, came three wide into the stretch, tipped out and lacked a rally. FLEET
ROY raced off the pace outside a rival on the backstretch, went two wide into the drive and was never a factor. RACING ACE angled to the two path
entering the first turn, got bumped and checked between rivals around that bend, saved ground inside to the stretch and came up empty. BROKEN FINGER
went four wide around the first turn, three wide around the second bend and had nothing left. BROCHACHO bumped by inside rival and checked at the
start, dropped back and was eased into the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
AMBIVALENT angled in early, raced outside rivals then closed in up the backstretch, went three deep around the turn, cleared in upper stretch and was
kept to task in the late stages. BEYOND BRILLIANT tracked off the inside, went inside a rival into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and edged EAGLE
CHIEF for the place. EAGLE CHIEF settled off the pace, came four wide into the stretch and got outkicked for second. NAISMITH well placed behind the top
pair early, raced between foes into the turn, waited for room at the quarter pole, shifted three wide leaving the bend and could not rally. EPIDEMIC lost
footing leaving the gate then broke inward, shifted in near the half-mile pole, swung four wide into the drive and never rallied. TITRATE bothered by
EPIDEMIC near the half-mile pole while along the inside, angled out upper stretch and proved no menace. PERFECTO AMOR trailed the field early, went
three wide into the turn, angled five wide into the stretch and flattened out. CIRCUMVENT bumped from outside at the start, dueled for the lead inside a
rival, inched ahead into the turn, cleared around the turn, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. TIVOLI TWIRL broke in and bumped rival, dueled
for the lead from outside, pressed into the turn, chased rival two wide into the stretch and faded.

BECCA TAYLOR stalked the leader from outside, bid alongside at the seven-sixteenths, dueled and put a head in front past the five-sixteenths, held a short
lead over the runner-up through the length of the stretch and prevailed. MADDIE'S MOJITO sped to the front, set the pace under pressure, dueled with
BECCA TAYLOR around the turn, lost command but fought back inside through the lane and proved a game second. MICHALSKA up close early, chased
two to three wide around the turn and held the show. RESPECTFULLY was a bit rank tossing her head in the beginning, chased two wide then checked at
the seven-sixteenths pole, angled to the rail around the turn and kept on through the lane while unable to gain the show. BIG STRETCH took the turn three
to four wide and could not rally. SWIFT NONNI sent inside and forced the pace early, dropped back around the turn, tired and eased in the lane and walked
off.

Footnotes
COMMANDER (FR) settled along the inside, saved ground to the stretch, steered out in the drive, rallied three wide and proved best late. JAMMING EDDY
chased the speed from the fence, cut the corner into the lane, tipped outside the leader and drew alongside in upper stretch, took over inside the eighth pole
but got outkicked by the winner. IAN GLASS set the pace up the backstretch, moved to the inside and saved ground around the turn, held a short lead
approaching the eighth pole, lost command soon after and yielded to the top pair. POLICY unhurried in the beginning, angled in on the turn then produced a
mild rally from inside to earn a minor share. RONALD R (IRE) raced off the pace, swung out into the stretch and was seven wide at the top of the lane then
improved position. OISEAU DE GUERRE chased outside a rival, three wide around the turn and never produced a bid. FULL OF LUCK (CHI) tracked off the
rail or outside rivals, went three deep around the bend, four wide into the stretch and could not rally. KITTEN'S CAT had early speed then chased outside
the leader, went two wide around the turn and weakened. VIA EGNATIA chased two wide into the turn, between rivals around the bend, was bothered by
KETTEN'S CAT with a furlong to go and weakened. APPRECIATED dropped back early, angled to the inside, exited the bend three wide and never
threatened.

off under steady handling. SHE'S A DIME pressed the pace from outside then between rivals, chased the speed alongside a foe on the turn, came three
wide into the stretch and bested the rest. DR WYSONG broke well then got shuffled back between rivals early, raced off the pace, went outside a rival on
the turn, exited the bend four wide and finished willingly to earn the show. CASSIE BELLE bumped at the start, tracked along the inside, saved ground
around the turn and improved position while never threatening. HOLLYWOOD HILLS trailed up the backstretch, went three to four wide around the turn and
passed tired rivals. HOTITUDE broke in and bumped rival at the start, sped to the front and vied for the lead from inside, could not match strides with the
leader around the turn, steadied behind rivals at the top of the stretch and weakened. SQUARE PEGGY hopped and broke out at leaving the gate, sent for
the lead and vied three deep early, took over at the seven-sixteenths pole, cleared briefly then got pressured by BELLA VITA on the turn, lost command

the winner and flattened to third. BRISTOL BAYOU in range early outside rivals, entered the turn four then angled in some around the bend, kept on through
the lane and gained a minor share but needed more late. NEW DRAMA broke in and bumped rival the start, dueled from outside then chased the leader into
the turn, challenged again around the bend, dueled to the eighth pole and weakened in deep stretch. BELLIZE reserved in the early going, went outside a
rival on the turn, angled out in the stretch and showed a mild response to improved position. MANGOTANGO chased from inside then two wide into and
around the turn, shifted three wide exiting the bend and lacked further response. FABIOLLA (GB) stalked the pace from inside and faded. KATLA stalked
