Footnotes
KISS ME COWGIRL chased the pace three wide into the stretch, drifted out a bit under right handed urging near the sixteenth marker, dug in determinedly
and got up in the final strides. ADMIRAL GLEN made the lead soon after the start, battled for the lead two wide in game effort and just missed. FAMILY JET
was hustled up the inside to contest the lead after a quarter, to constant urging while dueling for the lead until the final stages then was outfinished. MR
CHIPS stalked the pace four wide into the stretch, steadied and angled in as the winner drifted out late and finished evenly. GIVE ME A CHANCE failed to
menace. MARINESERGEANTJOHN was no factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

STRIKE APPEAL prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, responded when set down, made the lead late in a perfectly timed trip and edged clear
through the final stages. HIGH ROLLING DUDE never far back, closed willingly four wide through deep stretch and got up for second. LEVANTO (ARG)
close up from the start, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole, remained a sharp threat through the drive but was outfinished. DISCLOSURE
well placed, finished with good energy two wide. LAST DROP OF WINE away alertly, set a pressured pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. VAN
DAMME vied for the lead along the inside into the stretch and faded late. ARTEMUS EAGLE trailed from the start, advanced between horses two wide near
the five furlong marker then came up empty.

DIAMOND PATRIOT sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, widened on the turn, set all the pace and maintained his advantage under right handed
urging. MAKING ME CRAZY never far back, offered a mild bid along the inside into the stretch and finished well clear for second. AWESOME OX stalked
the pace and went evenly in the three path. GRANDER PLAN failed to menace. AINTGOTTACLUE broke slowly and passed tiring rivals. JOHN MILTON
was no factor. RESTITUTION was no threat. WITHOUT PASSPORT was outrun. MR. MAKOO had speed into the turn then stopped.

Footnotes
BLACK BUTTE made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and prevailed under right handed urging. PORT MARIA stalked the pace from the inside,
shifted to the five path and finished clear for second. BLUSHING BELLA well placed, dropped back on the turn then came on again late two wide. SHINY
SURPRISE offered a mild bid along the inside into the stretch then leveled off. SUN DRESS had speed from the start, inched closer three wide on the turn,
had speed into the stretch then came up empty. MCKINLI'SBABYBLUES failed to menace. LORETTAS SONG was no threat. COUNTRY ASSETS was no
factor. CRISIS AVERTED pressured the winner two wide into the stretch then gave way. MANCORA was outrun.
