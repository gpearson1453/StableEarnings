in upper stretch, was collared by the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and missed while clear for the place. ROCK ME was bumped on both sides at the
start then steadied while pinched back, moved out at the five-eighths then advanced on the outside, made a bid while five then four wide on the turn,
dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. TIGERBEACH was carried in early, stalked the pace down the
backstretch, dropped back while moving from four to three wide on the turn, reached the two path outside the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch and

Footnotes
MAW MAW'S SOPHIA was carried in early then taken up, went three wide for most of the turn under urging then shifted four wide, was driven five wide into
the stretch, rallied on the outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to win going away. STANG IT pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead in
the two to three path on the turn, shook clear under the whip in upper stretch, drifted out inside the furlong marker and was overtaken while able to get the
place. OUR STARLET came in early then bumped with a foe and was taken up some, moved out shortly thereafter, went four wide on the turn and lacked
the needed kick while able to get the show. WHODATWHODAT checked while put in tight early, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch in the
two path and improved position. BLUE RIDGE HEAT was forced in early then bumped, recovered well to chase the pace, dropped back while lugging out
near the seven-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path while falling further back, spun three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
CRYPTO BRAVE was urged along on the outside, bumped with a foe near the seven-sixteenths then lugged out into the turn, went around that bend in the
six path and failed to rally. CANDY CANDY CANDY checked while in tight early, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. MANE PRIORITY
came in early, set the pace under pressure to her outside, was headed along the rail on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.
BEAUTIFULANDWILD was reluctant to load, raced towards the back under urging, went four to five wide on the turn and never reached contention. IONA
GUITAR was urged along at the rear, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, quickly moved out before drifting further out at the
three-sixteenths, had an equipment problem with the left iron late and showed little.

Footnotes
BAYOU JAM was bumped hard at the start then forced into another foe and bounced around before being taken up, saved ground on the first turn, was
rated off the pace, came under urging while two then three wide early on the far turn, shifted four then five wide later on that bend, rallied outside into upper
stretch, chased under the whip while still on his inside lead into the final furlong then made a bid, dueled with the runner-up to the wire and narrowly
prevailed under strong urging. LUCKENBACHER brushed with a foe at the start, jostled with another foe early, went around the first turn in the two path,
was well placed down the backstretch, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, jostled with a foe while shoving his way out in upper stretch,
gained to make a bid between horses just inside the furlong marker, dueled with the winner to the wire and was denied while well clear for the place. HEZA
PRIORITY brushed with a foe into the first turn, contested the pace on the inside, was asked on the far turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong then
weakened while clear for the show. STANDING MAN broke out and brushed a foe at the start then was hustled, went four wide on the first turn, tracked the
pace on the outside, chased four wide on the far turn, jostled with the runner-up while carried out in upper stretch, chased while still on his inside lead into
the final furlong and also weakened. INCA WARRIOR broke in then brushed with a foe, went four wide early on the first turn then dropped to the two path,
was reserved off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path, was roused inside the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. PRE HEAT broke
out then bumped hard with a rival, brushed with a foe into the first turn, went around that bend in the three path, contested the pace on the outside, was
asked in the three path on the far turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired. MUSICAL MAN bumped with a foe at the start, went three wide
on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused five to six wide on the far turn, spun seven wide into the stretch and came up empty. RICHIE GARY
jostled with a foe early, went three then two wide on the first turn, settled well back in the field, moved from the two path to the four path on the far turn and
failed to threaten. JACI'S ROYALTY went four to five wide on the turns and was no factor.

placed under a hand ride to the wire while best. ON YOUR MARK showed good speed and set the clear pace, went around the turn in the two path, was set
down in upper stretch, lost the lead into the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. LAFITTE'S FLEET settled off the pace, moved from

hand ride to the wire. EMPRESS CATHERINE went two to three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, went three to four wide on the far turn, was
roused at the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch then bumped twice with a foe while carried out eight wide and was along for the place. SUKI

in upper stretch, slipped through inside a foe into the final furlong and improved to just get the show. MUCHO MACHO MOMMA went four wide on the first
turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the four path on the far turn, gained the lead into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner near
the furlong marker and weakened then lost the show. DOTTIE went three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, came under urging leaving the
backstretch, went four wide on the far turn then was driven six wide into the stretch before being carried seven wide and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
LI'L TOOTSIE was taken in hand early, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped in leaving the backstretch, went three then two wide
on the far turn, rallied along the rail in upper stretch, closed fast to get the lead just inside the furlong marker, shook clear into the final sixteenth and held
under strong urging. SARIAH SARIAH rounded the first turn in the two path under restraint, was reserved off the pace, raced in the two path on the far turn,
came three wide into the stretch, gained into the final furlong, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the place. SISTER ANNIE went
to the front, traveled around the first turn in the two path, set the pace in hand, was headed near the five-eighths, vied inside to the two path on the far turn,
regained the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner just inside the furlong marker, dropped back into the final sixteenth and
was outfinished while well clear for the show. SOCIAL DILEMMA saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging late on the
backstretch, went four wide under urging on the far turn then came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CANTATA broke out at the
start, was carried in early, went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, moved to the lead before the five-eighths pole, vied three wide
on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. BIG TIME was asked
leaving the gate, saved ground on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, moved from the inside to the two path on the far turn, shifted out under a
drive in upper stretch and came up empty. MINUTE WALTZ moved in early, went four wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside, chased
three wide on the far turn then four wide into the stretch and capitulated. BEAUTIFUL STAR was last to commence, went three wide on the turns and
showed little.
