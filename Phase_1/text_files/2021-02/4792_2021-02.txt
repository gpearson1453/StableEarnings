Footnotes
HE'S MEANT TO BE outrun in the early going off the inside, moved out to be five wide into the stretch, set down when straightened for home, kicked down
the leader under firm handling. ACE DESTROYER away in good order, asked early to contest the pace into the turn, alternated up front while closest to the
inside through the bend, disposed of the other speed to be clear when straightened for home, could not contain the winner while holding sway for the place.
TENTWELVEFOURTEEN lacked early foot, remained back into the turn, steadied from between horses late in the bend, moved out widest for the drive,
finished well while too late down the middle of the strip. BITUMEN broke a step slow, raced back toward the inside, moved out turning for home, improved
with some mild interest out in the strip. SHARP ART in the second flight while racing outside, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, had little left for the
run to the wire. UNSCATHED settled behind the pace along the inside, continued to save ground out of the turn, failed to muster a closing response.
DRILL'S LI'L MAN in the second group early while off the inside, steadily faded. KITCHEN FIRE broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside, gave way in the
drive.

SIMONA'S CHOICE broke inward, straightened, forwardly placed from the start outside, pressed three wide through the turn, dueled into and through upper
stretch, edged away under steady handling. NORTHERN DIAMOND off the pace while racing outside and in hand, crept closer while four wide late in the
turn, roused when straightened for home, closest a furlong out, could not match the winner late, lasted for the place. LA PULCINELA lacked speed while
along the inside, moved while continuing to save ground late in the turn, steered out, roused, finished willingly to be getting to the runner up. GRAVITRON
away in good order, was asked early to hold frontal position along the rail, narrowly showed the way through the turn inside then gradually tired through the
stretch. FOREVER HOME lacked early foot, asked along then angled out to be four wide in some traffic late in the turn, improved slightly through the lane
while drifting a bit. FORTUNA ADIUVAT within striking distance off the inside, angled in a bit when improving slightly turn, came up empty for the drive.
KOWGIRL KIRBY floated in at the start, raced back well off the inside, carried out five wide turning for home, lacked a closing response. RENEGADE
SUNSET forwardly placed, shuffled back from between horses into the turn, remained back in the run to the wire. LITTLE SURE SHOT broke alertly, with
the pace up the backstretch in the two path, gave way in the drive. X MARKS THE SPOT fell back to trail after the start, four wide turn, fell further back in

Footnotes
INTREPID HEART outrun in the early going outside, began a steady advance in the far turn four wide, continued to gain into the stretch, long drive, willingly
to be up in time while far out in the strip.. BOBBY BABY settled off the pace, moved out, swung out for the drive while being asked, late bid while between
rivals, outkicked in the late going while also well out in the strip but inside the winner. SHAKES CREEK closest to the leader, went after that one in the
second turn, challenged from the outside with a furlong remaining, not enough for the top two late. MISSISSIPPI settled off the pace and the inside, three
wide trip, went evenly in the drive to improve slightly. SECRET HOUSE broke alertly, asked to clear into the first turn, set a reasonable pace just off the
inside, weakened when headed with less than a furlong remaining. HERE COMES DOC broke back, lacked speed, continued back far turn, came five wide
into the stretch, made little impact in the run to the wire. SEDARIS raced in mid pack toward the rail, saved ground through the final turn, had little for the
stretch run. WICKETS WAY last away, devoid of any early foot, remained always back. KOWBOY KARMA was finished after a half.

Footnotes
GALLANT PLUNGER in the second flight while racing off the inside, three wide advance, took over upper stretch, drew clear under steady handling.
HANDY behind the pace toward the inside, asked along in the far turn, behind traffic into the lane, clear stretch, 2nd best. PERFECT SENSE settled in mid
pace toward the inside, in the two path through the second turn, moved out for the drive, up for the show late, no match for the top two. DERBY CODE one
paced off the inside, three wide second turn, angled out to be five wide into the stretch, slowly gaining for the show while also not a serious threat to the top
pair. INCORRIGIBLE chased the early leader, tried that one from the outside mdiway on the second turn, yielded to the winner soon after and then
weakened in the drive. TURN THE SWITCH took command after breaking in good order, set the pace, faltered when confronted in the second turn. FAST
RECOVERY void of speed outside, four down to five wide first turn, continued wide and back the middle half, five wide into the far bend, no menace stretch.
EUROEXIT four wide into the first turn when back, remained in the four path for the second turn, failed to muster a rally when called on in the drive. CHASE
TRACKER was finished early. MAU MAU last to leave, was always outrun.

Footnotes
GENERAL TREV off the erly pace toward the inside, moved out, steered four turning for home, challenged while drifting in a bit inside the furlong grounds,
quickly clear. DAVIDIC LINE settled in mid pack three wide, continued behind the pace turn, rallied late for the place, no threat to the winner. SOUTHSIDE
SWIG broke on top, set the pace off the inside, continued to show the way in to the lane, offered brief resistance to the winner with less than a furlong
marker then proved no match, caught late for the place. HAYDENS HAVOC forwardly placed for a half along the inside, weakened. ROGALLO floated out a
bit early, void of speed, four wide through the turn, improved position while not a serious threat. SOLDIER BOY prompted the pace while racing three wide
for a half then came up empty for the drive. JIMMIE T failed to menace. EAST MOON LAKE bothered in the early going when COLD SMOKE came out,
remained always back. HARD TO PARK off a step slow, trailed as a result, three path into the lane, was never a factor. COLD SMOKE came out to bother
EAST MOON LAKE just after the start, within striking distance while four out to five wide in the turn, backed up stretch.

Footnotes
BACKGROUND dueled early along the inside into the first turn, allowed the leader to go onto the backstretch, moved out slightly and went back after that
rival into the far turn, took over, drew clear then held the runner up safe late under steady handling. SANTOS DUMONT four wide when off the pace through
the first turn, continue well wide and off the pace up the backstretch, four wide again in the second turn, drew closer to the winner with a furlong remaining
but could do nothing further with that rival, clearly second best. LNGTERMRELATIONSHP void of early foot, off the inside, asked along and began to
advance midway on the second turn, steered out six wide turning for home, finished willingly to rally for the show, no threat to the top two. AASR lacked
early foot while saving ground after breaking slowly, moved closer while continuing inside second turn, tapped on the brakes to briefly wait and then steady
late in that bend, moved out, brushed midstretch, improved position, no threat to the top three. COACH BAHE void of speed, bothered into the first turn,
remained back onto the backstretch, improved through the second turn in the two path, flattened out a bit in the drive to finish up evenly. ATOKA dueled
early on the outside, asked to clear after a quarter, set a quick set of fractions when clear, gave way when challenged by the winner in the second turn.
TOTALLY JIMBO settled off the pace well off the inside, had little left for the drive. UPHOLD raced in mid pack off the inside, failed to rally. ALEX JOON
broke back, was five wide into the first turn, improved in the three path second turn then flattened out in the drive. AMANI'S EAGLE failed to menace while
racing four out to five wide. BLUE STEEL forwardly placed for a half, tired. GREAT FACES finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
MYSTIC GUIDE away in good order, raced unhurried while within striking distance four wide through the first bend, continued outside the middle half, crept
closer under his own courage late in the final turn, let out a notch into the lane, assumed command past the furlong marker under a right handed stick, drove
well clear under continued use of the crop right handed to be well clear. SILVER PROSPECTOR settled in behind the leader while saving ground, called on
for some run late in the final turn, got through inside to briefly challenge upper stretch, proved no match for the winner to the wire, held sway for the place.
OWENDALE lacked speed while saving ground through the first turn, continued inside the middle half, moved a bit closer through the second turn remaining
along the rail, steered out for the drive when straightened for home, altered course back toward the inside behind a drifting HUNKA BURNING LOVE past
the furlong marker then was up for the show over that rival while slowly getting to the runner up. HUNKA BURNING LOVE broke sharp to show the way past
the wire the first time, two path through that turn when setting a moderate pace, remained two off the rail when continuing to set the pace through the final
turn, steadily weakened from between the top two when headed entering the stretch all the while drifting out. RATED R SUPERSTAR last away, trailed,
swung out five wide for the drive only to come up empty for the stretch run. LONG RANGE TODDY chased the leader off the inside for five furlongs, moved
closer to that one into the far turn, gave way from between rivals entering the stretch. MAILMAN MONEY within striking distance in the two path, had
nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
KIMARI broke with the field, stalked the pace from the outside, four wide through the turn, ranged up to challenge entering the stretch and drew strongly
clear under a brisk hand ride. CASUAL last away, void of speed, swung out widest into the lane, closed with good energy to annex the place while not a
serious threat to the winner. SHESOMAJESTIC broke alertly, pressed the issue three wide, vied between horses into the lane, gradually weakened in
proving no match for the top two, saved the show in the late going. AMY'S CHALLENGE asked early to maintain position in the first flight along the rail,
narrowly showed the way into and through the turn, had little left to weaken in the drive, outkicked late for the show. BEST KEPT SECRET lacked speed off
the inside, dropped toward the inside when moving closer late in the turn, some traffic into the lane, moved out in midstretch, finished up evenly. AIN'T NO
ELMERS broke well, narrowly set the early pace, vied between horses into and through the turn, gave way abruptly in the drive to trail home.

Footnotes
MOLTO VIVACE behind the first group outside, asked late in the turn, firm handling, outside bid, wore foes down late. NAME REJECTED close up from the
start, pressed the issue three wide into the turn, crept closer and challenged into the stretch, dueled past the furlong marker, proved game for the place
while being outkicked by the winner late. STILLETO BOY outrun early well out in the strip, raced five wide into the stretch, challenged four wide late in the
bend, dueled with the runner up past the furlong marker, outkicked in the late going while between the top two at the wire. RIGHT TONE mid pack in the run
up the backstretch well wide, tucked toward the inside to save some ground with a three wide trip through the turn, staged a mild rally down the lane to
improve position. COST AVERAGE broke back, lacked early speed, angled out to be six wide exiting the turn, improved position with some mild late interest
while not posing a serious threat. TEST OF WILL moved up to vie after the start in the two path, put a head in front early in the turn, vied until late in the
bend and then gave way in the drive. RESERVE away in good order, also raced with the pace for a half before faltering in the drive. NAVY SEAL within
striking distance while racing toward the inside, also came empty when the real running began at the head of the lane. PIZZA CHARLIE void of speed while
four wide, passed tiring rivals. LAZARETTO off a step slow, nefver menaced. MY FAVORITE UNCLE was never involved. BAMALAMA in mid pack and
traffic early, gave way before a half.

Footnotes
ESSENTIAL QUALITY outquicked past the wire the first time toward the rail, worked way out to be four wide by early in the first turn, in hand while
continuing outside in the run up the backstretch, ranged up to challenge outside the two leaders under his own courage midway on the second turn while
remaining in the four path, put a head in front exiting that bend and steadily increased his advantage while only shown the crop but under a firm hand ride to
the end. SPIELBERG unprepared at the start then ducked out to spot the field a couple of lengths, moved a bit closer while carried out in the five path by the
winner entering the first bend, continued well wide, five path again turning into the stretch, lodged a mild bid but quickly lost contact with the winner nearing
the furlong grounds, remained well clear of the others. JACKIE'S WARRIOR took command after the start closest to but still well out in the strip, began to be
ridden along when confronted midway in the second turn, proved no match for the winner soon after entering the stretch then had little for the runner up
soon after, continued in even fashion the final furlong to comfortably hold the show. WOODHOUSE asked a bit to press the leader from the outside into the
first turn, remained in a pressured factor in the run up the backstretch, called on far turn, lodged a brief bid, began to be hard ridden late in that turn, could
not keep up and weakened from between horses into the lane. LAST SAMURAI a bit restless in the gate, broke in good order, settled in mid pack in the
three path, angled four wide turning for home but came up empty for the run to the wire. SANTA CRUISER void of speed, remained back in making little
impact. SAFFA'S DAY within striking distance toward the inside for five furlongs, began to give way far turn.

Footnotes
LONE ROCK rank while five wide into the first turn, steadied, back, five advance into lane, lugged in, late bid, up in time. CHRIS AND DAVE six wide when
off the pace into the first turn, remained outside, appeared to take command turning for home, clear a furlong out, could not contain the winner, remained
well clear for the place. ALL WEST forwardly placed inside, remained prominent in the second with what appeared to be a bid, failed to punch through in the
lane. EASY SHOT lacked early foot, improved position without posing a serious threat to the top three. ARRIVAL within striking distance off the inside, came
up empty for the drive. MURALIST last to leave, trailed, improved position without posing a serious threat. DUNPH pressed the issue early off the inside.
BEAVER HAT in mid pack early, lacked a response in the drive. WARRIOR'S MAP set the early pace, gave way. AMERICAN DUBAI tired in the drive.
WHAT A COUNTRY remained always back. SONNY SMACK stopped in the drive, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in. DENSE FOG
OBSCURED THE POINTS OF CALL.
