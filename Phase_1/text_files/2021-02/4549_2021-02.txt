pressed the early pace, went five wide into the second turn, weakened late and held for second. GOLDEN MERGER was void of any early speed, advanced
between rivals into the home turn, angled to the inside and flattened out. NEW YORK PROUD tracked the early pace, went six wide through the second turn
and was empty late. CHAMPION DEPUTY was taken back early, went four wide into the second turn and offered no rally. THREE CHIPS was allowed to
settle early, saved ground and never fired. KEATON raced in mid pack early, raced off the rail into the home turn, angled to the inside and gave way.
