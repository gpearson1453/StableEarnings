Footnotes
OPTIMISTIC VALOR prompted the pace two wide, took a narrow lead early on the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. HE
AIN'T NO SAINT broke outwardly shutting off COLTSONTHEADMIRAL and had that one clip his heels soon after the start, stalked the pace from the rail,
went two wide while boxed in rounding the far turn, got a clear path in upper stretch and finished willingly. COLTONSTHEADMIRAL clipped heels early then
bumped DUEL FUEL while regaining stride, raced well back inside, advanced four wide around the far turn and was along for the show. DOUBLE DAVID
settled off the early pace two wide, moved up to bid three wide around the far but came up empty in the lane. DUEL FUEL was bumped early, had the rider
stand straight up for no obvious reason early on the first turn, raced two wide off the pace around both turns and lacked a rally while never really clear in the
lane. BASTIEN LE BROWN failed to menace while racing three wide. LORD THEO was outrun inside. ASCENDED set the pace along the rail under some
pressure from the winner, vied inside of that foe around the far turn and retreated through the lane. STAR DEPUTY played no factor while racing three and
four wide.

Footnotes
AWESOME BEACH dueled for the lead two wide, then from between horses after BERHANU ranged up at the three furlong pole, repelled that foe turning or
home after putting away his inner dueling counterpart, then drew off through upper stretch, and was driven home while hanging on his left lead. GEGE
CONQUEST trailed three wide, took the turn in the four path, and stayed on through the lane while hanging on his left lead to prove second best. TOP
BOSS dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, then inside of a pair of foes passing the three furlong pole, but gave way approaching the quarter
pole. JR SPEED lied off of the pace two wide around the turn, and failed to make an impact. BERHANU stalked three wide, bid for the lead approaching the
five sixteenths pole, but was repelled by an inner rival turning for home, and weakened thereafter. FOSTER HOPE saved ground off of the pace, but failed
to factor.

Footnotes
HIGH TIDE trailed in the two path for a half, edged closer three wide rounding the far turn, swung widest turning for home, surged outside, swept to the front
near the sixteenth pole and widened from there. LIGHT CRUISER stalked the pace from the rail around both turns, angled four wide in upper stretch, bid
between foes in midstretch and finished willingly while no match for the winner late. MAKER OF AN EMPIRE set the pace along the rail to the sixteenth pole
and held well enough to preserve the show. ALONZO MOSELY steadied along while fighting the bit through the opening half, raced three wide around both
turns and lacked a the needed rally. MR MATUSCHEK raced two wide in midpack early, bid three wide around the far turn, reached near even terms in
upper stretch then weakened leaving the eighth pole. FEAR THE DEER saved ground and failed to menace. GUNMAN pressed the pace two wide and tired
through the stretch. THE RUN-UP WAS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
FLORADO quickly cleared, widened her advantage in upper stretch under driving pressure before being wrapped up passing the sixteenth marker.
MARICOPA lied far off of the pace in the two path around the turn, rallied inside of foes through the final furlong, and split rivals in the late stages to just
reach place. WATER WIZARD tracked from midpack in the three path around the turn, then stayed on to reach place late, but was outfinished by an inner
rallying rival on the wire for that position. TRINNI SUNSHINE broke outwardly but was clear of her most immediate foe, tracked the clear leader while
forwardly placed along the inside, proved no match for that rival while edging place in upper stretch, but lost late position late. TRINNI GIRLS lied far off of
the pace in the four path around the turn, and played no factor. NOMBRE was bumped by an inner foe at the start, stalked the clear leader two wide, but
weakened in upper stretch. SENORITA SALSA lied off of the pace along the inside, and faded. BUSINESSINDUBAI broke outwardly and bumped a rival at
the start, lied well off of the pace two wide, and was outrun.

Footnotes
BREAK BEAT stalked the pace three wide, put a head in front nearing the eighth pole, battled outside of a pair of rivals from there and edged ahead under a
drive. SHINING THROUGH saved ground in range around both turns, came through a sizable opening at the rail in upper stretch, reached near even terms
in mid stretch, bobbled late and was second best. CALL BROS set the pace in the two path, was confronted by challenges on both sides in upper stretch,
battled on between to deep stretch and weakened late. POPPY'S BOYS chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. DREAMIN OF SEVILLE
went evenly inside. YADI raced well back two wide, swung five wide turning for home and was one-paced through the lane. LEADING FACTOR had early
speed inside but was through after a half.

MY ASHLEIGH set the pace, drew off approaching the quarter pole, got roused to widen in midstretch, felt a single left handed stick at the sixteenth pole
before coming under hand urging late. MO CLARE'S lied far off of the pace along the inside, rallied inside of foes turning for home to claim place in upper
stretch, and proved second best. MACKENZIE'S GIRL chased the leader from the outside while pressing that around the turn, but failed to keep pace with
that rival approaching the quarter pole, then lost place in upper stretch. LOW PRESSURE ZONE trailed the field in the three path around the turn, then
passed a tired rival late without factoring. GOODBYE GABY chased the pace three wide, but weakened turning for home.

COPPER broke outwardly, set a rated pace along the rail, repulsed a bid nearing the lane and edged away under a drive. TRISH THE DISH trailed in the
three path for seven furlongs, came six wide into the lane and rallied widest. PEARLESCENT was off slow, moved up outside early on the first turn, pressed
the winner two wide, reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths pole, fought on to midstretch and weakened a bit late. SHE FLED THE SCENE raced
in range two wide between rivals around both turns and was one-paced in the lane. KITTEN'S FINEST checked midway around the first turn, moved up
three wide down the backstretch, bid three deep rounding the far turn and faded in the lane. STRIKE MAGIC steadied at the start, saved ground off the
pace, angled out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and lacked a closing bid while the rider waved the whip right-handed. WHAT'S THE MOVE
failed to menace while racing three and four wide. THE RUN-UP WAS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
LIZA STAR set the pace, widened passing the half mile pole to open up on a long lead around the turn, then tired through the late stages, but held safely.
LADY ARCHA saved ground far off of the pace around the turn, commenced a rally by splitting foes two wide passing the three sixteenths marker, bumped
EXTRA EFFORT in the process, then sustained her bid to reach place at the sixteenth marker, and continued to gain on the tiring leader, but ran out of
ground. BIRD MAP tracked from midpack along the inside, forged place from an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by another foe for
that position passing the sixteenth pole. VICTORY CRUSADE lied well off of the pace in the four to three path around the turn, and improved without
threatening. WE MISS SUSIE took the turn in the four path while off of the pace, and had no rally. EXTRA EFFORT bumped with an inner rival at the start,
pressed the eventual winner two wide through the opening quarter mile, but failed to keep pace into the turn, chased that rival from the three path around
that bend while loosing ground, then weakened further after being bumped by an inner foe entering the lane. CHUTZPAH bumped with an outer foe at the
start, then was outrun throughout, got eased through the lane, and jogged across the wire.

SONG RIVER hit the starting gate, was bumped between foes at the start, was squeezed back not long after, made strong progress in hand two wide
between foes around the turn, tipped out to split rivals three wide in upper stretch, closed strongly and was up and clear late. DADDY'S JOY sped to the
front, set the pace along the rail, held clear well past the eighth pole but could not resist the winner late. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT steadied into the turn,
saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and ran on for the show. LA CARA BONITA stalked the pace three wide between foes, bid nearing
the lane but weakened in the drive. MISS MIAMI stalked the pace two wide and faded in the lane. TRUE HEIRESS was pinched back at the start, raced two
wide and never threatened. FOLLOW ME MOM broke out and bumped foes at the start, chased the pace four wide and retreated through the lane. ARCH
OF FIRE was soundly bumped at the start, raced four wide and was no further factor.

Footnotes
HAPPY CHAMP rushed to set the pace leaving the chute, felt pressure from YOUNG FLINT around the turn, but drew clear from that foe at the quarter pole,
and was ridden out to the wire while widening. YOUNG FLINT prompted the eventual winner two wide, opened up on the rest of the field with that rival
around the turn, but proved no match for that foe at the quarter pole, weakened on his left lead through the lane, but held place. QUINTO SOL lied far off of
the pace in the two path around the turn, came into the lane in the four path, and improved past a tiring rival. UNIMPEACHED stalked along the inside, but
failed to keep pace with the leading duo into the turn, and weakened thereafter. TRUE IDENTITY was never involved. THIRSTY'S PRIDE lied forwardly
placed outside of the leading pair leaving the chute, but was done early.
