Footnotes
FOURTH DESIGN broke readily to gain a narrow advantage along the inside racing to the first turn, was taken in hand to concede the lead while switching
outside the pacesetter after the opening quarter, pulled his way to terms with that foe after a half, took over racing into the far turn and was kept to some left
handed pressure to maintain a clear advantage to the end. DISCREET HEAT prompted the pace outside a rival racing to the first turn, set the pace on a
narrow margin just off the inside through the backstretch, couldn't match the winner once headed by that foe on the far turn but continued with a grudging
effort to prevail for the place honors. TAPSOLUTE tracked off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out to three path leaving the midway
point of the far turn and continued with interest in that path while being just outkicked for second. PAINTER'S PRIDE settled last along the inside to the
backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, then angled outside rivals leaving midstretch while displaying some late interest. SMART WARRIOR tracked off
the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch but offered no rally. OUT OF PATIENCE tracked off the first flight racing three deep to the
backstretch, was fanned four wide racing through the far turn to upper stretch and steadily faded.

Footnotes
LITIGANT broke readily, angled inwards leaving the chute to dictate the pace on a narrow margin just off the inside racing to the turn, went clear nearing
upper stretch and was kept to steady right handed pressure to extend the advantage. STUNNING BABY settled last along the inside racing to the turn,
shifted outside foes leaving the bend, angled seven wide racing through the stretch and continued with a steady late bid to edge rivals for the place honors
while never menacing the winner. WICKED STRONG ALEX, in touch with the leaders four wide between foes racing through the backstretch, angled to the
inside nearing the lane and continued with interest while just missing for second. HE HAD A SECRET switched off the inside leaving the chute, while being
prompted in pursuit of the pacesetter three deep between foes, continued off the inside between foes on the bend and faded in late stages. TALON hopped
at the start while breaking last, was settled along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch, then shifted outside a rival in late stages to improve his position
between rivals. IMPERIAL GUARD, urged to a forward placing five deep leaving the chute tracking just off the pacesetter, shifted nearer to the inside racing
into the turn prompting the leader but came up empty leaving midstretch. CONSILIUM, caught six wide in the opening stages tracking off the first flight, was
fanned six wide between foes racing into the stretch but had no closing bid. HAY HAY MY MY, caught three deep between foes, then shuffled a bit avoiding
close quarters midway through the backstretch, steadily faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
THE GODDESS LYSSA broke readily, sped away to a clear advantage racing a bit off the rail through the backstretch, held sway on a widening advantage
to upper stretch and was kept to some firm encouragement. BRONX BEAUTY switched outside rivals in the second flight racing through the backstretch,
then made steady progress four wide, then three deep in late stages to edge a rival for the place honors late. POSEIDON'S PASSION, forwardly placed
three deep tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, shifted inwards racing through the stretch and just missed for second. HEIRESSALL tracked
just off the pacesetter along the inside racing into the turn and faded in late stages. CAUGHT UP IN YOU was settled into stride while shifting nearer to the
inside racing to the turn but never gained contention. TALE OF SUCCESS broke outwards bumping at the start while getting away a bit slowly, switched out
five wide in the opening stages but failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
CHESS MASTER was urged between foes from the break to force the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage
nearing upper stretch, then shook clear late while being kept to firm hand urging. BEE BY THE SEA was urged along the inside pursuing the first flight into
the turn, split rivals just off the inside racing into upper stretch and edged a rival narrowly for the place honors on the wire. STRIKING HEIR shifted inwards
while being urged to a forward placing three deep racing just off the first flight in the opening stages, continued in that path to upper stretch but couldn't gain
terms with the winner, then just missed for second nearing the wire. FOX ROX was urged inside the eventual winner from the outset pressing that rival's
pace, dueled into upper stretch and weakened in the last furlong. OAK BLUFFS raced off the second flight along the inside in the opening stages, switched
out racing into upper stretch and continued evenly between foes late. PRETTY CHITU tracked just off the second flight racing four wide into the turn, then
faded in the closing stages and was observed to have bled from the mouth when returning to be unsaddled. WAPITI WAY broke sharply but dropped back
to last after the opening furlong. SOLD ON SALSA, caught five wide dropping well off the second flight racing to the turn, proved no factor.

Footnotes
MELISSANI broke readily, angled to the rail prompting a rival's pace racing into the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn, edged forward to a
narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, drifted out while gaining a clear advantage midstretch and continued in the five path late while being kept to steady
pressure. ATHENASWAY tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with a steady
effort just off the inside to prevail for the place honors. HOLIDAY CURLS settled in hand in the last flight while being switched outside rivals racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide on the far turn and continued to make steady progress while being fanned five wide in the closing stages to
prevail for a share. MINEWELLRECEIVED tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight in the opening half, lost some position racing into
the far turn, angled inside rivals in upper stretch and continued with a steady second effort to regain some position. COUNTESS JESSICA was roused to
the lead from the break to gain a narrow advantage between foes racing to the backstretch, pressed the pace outside the eventual winner racing to the far
turn and gave way. MOMENTS TO SAVER raced four wide to the backstretch tracking off the second flight and steadily faded in late stages. TEGLA, urged
to a forward placing three wide attending the pace to the backstretch, came under pressure racing into the far turn and steadily faded into the stretch. PORT
SALERNO settled last racing to the backstretch but proved no threat. PEGGY O'PRADO tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch and
steadily retreated nearing the lane.

Footnotes
JUAN BOLY was hustled inside foes racing into the first turn to gain a narrow advantage, dictated the pace shifting to the two path racing through the
backstretch, steadily widened the advantage nearing upper stretch while shifting to the three path and was kept to firm right handed pressure while drawing
away. BATTLE CREEK settled last while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and proved best of the others. IT'S
MANDATORY, caught four wide racing into the first turn, tracked outside rivals in second flight, continued three deep into the far turn and continued willingly
into the lane to prevail for a share. BIG TALL DAWG angled to the inside in the opening quarter tracking off the second flight, was prompted to make brief
progress inside foes racing into the far turn, shifted off the inside nearing upper stretch and flattened out in the drive. KING ANDRES tracked the leaders
inside foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, faded between foes after a half, then shifted out five wide in the closing stages while finishing in hand.
TEN MILES HIGH, forwardly placed outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, tracked just off that foe to the far turn and steadily faded nearing upper
stretch. ACTION WARRIOR flashed brief pace between foes racing into the first turn but retreated early. SURVEY (IRE) dropped out early.

Footnotes
WALLYPOP broke readily to gain a forward placing four wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards nearing the turn to prompt a rival's pace, took over
midway through the bend, shifted out nearing upper stretch while being roused to repel a challenge from THROWN FOR A LOUPE racing into upper stretch
and held that rival gamely to the end under firm left handed encouragement. The latter took up a position tracking off the first flight inside rivals racing to the
turn, was prompted to advance shifting three wide nearing upper stretch, steadily moved to terms with the pacesetter racing into upper stretch but couldn't
quite best that foe while disputing the issue to the end. POWERFUL MOON sped to the lead while angling to the inside setting the pace on a narrow
advantage, dueled for command inside the eventual winner racing into the turn, couldn't match the top pair nearing the furlong marker and gave way late.
ALMONASTER was prompted to a forward placing between foes tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn and steadily faded into the stretch. WILD
CHASE, slow to gathered stride, settled outside foes, angled inwards racing into the turn and passed inside some tiring rivals late. BIZ NOW, caught four
wide racing off the second flight to the turn, offered no rally. DEVILISH THOUGHTS was urged three wide between foes to gain a position just off the
leaders racing to the turn but steadily faded after three furlongs. UPRISE tracked off the second flight between foes and dropped back early. CAPTAIN FUN
broke slowly, was prompted to gain a position off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn but steadily faded into upper stretch. WICKED DUDE
ducked out at the start, then bore out to the outside rail racing through the backstretch into the turn, was collected, then corrected course racing into the
stretch and displayed some belated interest while proving no factor.

Footnotes
ESTILO PELIGROSO, in touch with the leaders nearest the rail in the opening furlong, tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the
backstretch while under some prompting to maintain striking distance, tipped outside the pacesetter entering upper stretch and continued with a steady late
response to wear down CURLEE FOX and gain a clear advantage in time under firm encouragement. The latter was urged to the lead inside rivals dictating
the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, edged away to a clear margin nearing upper stretch but couldn't fend off the winner's final bid. EL FEFO
urged to a forward placing three deep prompting the leaders to the backstretch, steadily faded racing into the far turn but continued well enough to edge a
rival for a share late. GEORGIA PINES was urged between foes prompting the pacesetter into the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. CHANNEL MAN
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ZENDEN was urged along the inside disputing the pace racing through the backstretch into the turn, shifted off the rail nearing upper stretch contesting the
issue in the three path past midstretch and gamely held the challenge of SOUPER STONEHENGE to the end under firm left handed encouragement. The
latter broke readily, shifted inwards to press the pace outside the eventual winner racing into the turn, dueled with that foe while being floated to the four
path racing through the stretch but contested the issue grudgingly to the end. EDGEMONT ROAD was rated just off the first flight racing outside a rival on
the backstretch, steadily gained on those rivals three deep nearing upper stretch, was fanned to the five path nearing midstretch but couldn't gain even
terms with the top pair while edging a rival for a share. FIREMAN OSCAR was settled last while angling to the inside racing through the backstretch, saved
ground on the turn gaining momentum to advance inside foes entering upper stretch but continued evenly in the last furlong. SHIVAREE was settled outside
foes tracking off the second flight racing to the turn, angled four wide into the lane and passed some tiring rivals while no real threat. COOL ARROW was
prompted to track the leaders along the inside racing behind the second flight and steadily faded into the stretch. ADMIRAL LYNCH bobbled at the start
while breaking slowly, was prompted in brief pursuit of the leaders along the inside racing into the bend but gave way racing into the lane.

Footnotes
TIZ HERSELF was rated off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, came under pressure to advance racing into the far turn, shifted out three
wide nearing upper stretch and found her best stride in the closing stages to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. PRAY FOR RAIN angled
inwards to dictate the pace between foes on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, was roused to repel a rival's challenge nearing upper stretch
maintaining a narrow advantage but couldn't fend off the winner late. BLAZING ZENNA, forwardly placed along the inside attending the pace, conceded
some position after a half tracking off the first flight, was urged to challenge along the rail nearing upper stretch, pressed the issue to the furlong marker but
weakened late. EL VALOR, held up avoiding close quarters while angling to the inside early, tracked off the second flight to the backstretch, swung out four
wide nearing the lane and continued with interest to gain some position. C'EST PARTI tracked off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch and came
up empty nearing the lane. MAY BEAU settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. MY OWN PASSION was settled last
near the inside racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. LOVELY TROPHY GIRL tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, was fanned wide
into the far turn and steadily faded. SOCIAL DISCUSSION, urged to a forward placing three wide prompting the pace to the backstretch, gave way while
shifting out five wide racing through the far turn.
