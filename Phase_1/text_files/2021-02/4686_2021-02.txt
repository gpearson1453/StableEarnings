Footnotes
LOULEIGH was hustled from the start, showed speed on the inside of a rival, was eased back off the pace midway down the backstretch then moved to the
outside, tracked in the two path early on the turn, was asked while coming out into the three path at the five-sixteenths, gained to make a bid between
horses into the stretch then took the advantage, kicked clear under a right-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths, drew away under the whip into the final
seventy yards then was placed under a strong hand ride to the wire while much the best. RUE LALA broke out at the start, settled in third position, moved
closer late on the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, made a bid near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch and proved
no match for the winner while able to get the place. THIRSTYPROSPECT bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, saved ground while asked on
the turn, came under the whip at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path, dropped back to the rail outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked
the needed response while best of the rest. MOLLYS FLYIN HIGH bumped with a foe at the start then was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure
to her inside, moved clear outside the half-mile pole, raced inside on the turn, was asked under heavy threat coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage
to the winner into upper stretch and tired. ABIGAIL G broke near the back of the field, was urged along on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn,
dropped to the three path late on that bend and failed to respond. BODIE ON POINTE settled off the pace, was urged four then five wide on the turn, drifted
out in upper stretch and also failed to respond.

Footnotes
EKATI'S VERVE was grabbed with the left rein at the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled in second behind the solo leader, moved closer with
a half-mile to run, was given his cue in the three path on the far turn, came under a right-handed whip inside the five-sixteenths, dropped to the two path
while just behind the leader into the stretch, switched to a left-handed whip at the three-sixteenths, brushed with a foe while pursuing the runner-up into the
final furlong, switched back to a right-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole, gained the lead into the final sixteenth and prevailed under vigorous handling.
TREASURY dropped in while hustled to the lead, was taken in hand into the first turn, drew off while inside on that bend, set the pace on a sizable lead
while in hand, saw the lead diminish with a half-mile to run, raced inside while patiently handled on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under his own
power, was asked coming to the three-sixteenths then came under a right-handed whip outside the furlong marker, led until near the sixteenth-pole then
was overtaken but just held the place. GOLD DOUBLE was off a step slow, raced in the two path for the first half of the clubhouse turn then dropped to the
inside, settled comfortably off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch then was asked at the seven-sixteenths, started the far turn on the inside then
moved to the two path, shifted four wide inside the five-sixteenths, chased outside into upper stretch, brushed with the winner in pursuit of the runner-up into
the final furlong and finished willingly to just miss the place while well clear for the show. ABSAM went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside,
was urged four then five wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. GRAVES MILL ROAD broke a step
slow, went four wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MATHESON went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, gained three wide into the
stretch then drifted in at the three-sixteenths, rallied along the rail to make a bid inside the furlong marker, gained the lead just inside the sixteenth-pole and
prevailed under good handling. POCKET PLAYER settled well back in the field while saving ground, gained into the stretch, altered out when the winner
drifted in at the three-sixteenths, chased while on his inside lead into the final furlong then was thrown in to elicit a lead change, swapped back to his inside
lead while gaining in the final sixteenth and just got up for the place. BOTSWANA TAPS drew off in the two path on the first turn, opened up a large
advantage on the backstretch, remained well clear while coaxed along in the two path on the far turn, was roused while drifting four wide into the stretch, led
under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken and lost the place but was well clear for the show. DEANOS CAPE was caught five wide on the first
turn, passed the nine-sixteenths under urging, went two then three wide under urging on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the
needed response. IN THE ARCH hit the right stall door when it reverberated back in front of him at the start, rounded the first turn in the four path, settled on
the outside, was urged three wide early on the far turn, drifted out five wide at the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. BRIAR JUMPER was taken back
early, went two to three wide on the turns, turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to threaten. ON BASE went three wide on the first turn, was
reserved towards the rear, dropped back under urging leaving the backstretch and faltered.

Footnotes
CITADEL checked while rank off heels in the two to three path on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, went two then three wide on the far turn, was
roused while swinging six wide into the stretch, rallied to get the lead inside the three-sixteenths, shook clear into the final furlong then extended the
advantage, drifted in at the sixteenth-pole then was straightened by the rider while switching back to his inside lead and proved best under steady handling.
CONTACT TRACING settled on the inside, came off the rail around the three-eighths, shifted three then four wide around the five-sixteenths, rallied into the
stretch, gained a short lead at the three-sixteenths then lost the advantage to the winner, drifted in under a right-handed whip into the final furlong and
proved no match while clear for the place. S MAN went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, was well rated while setting the pace, came under
urging along the rail while under heavy threat on the far turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. BIRTHDAY PARTY
broke out at the start, went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, was asked at the seven-sixteenths, made a bid in the three
path on the far turn, battled under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and came up empty. RUN FAR bumped with a rival at the start
and was carried out, went four wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside, dropped back four then five wide under urging on the far turn and
retreated. MACHO MARK bumped with a rival at the start then came outwards, went five to six wide on the turns and faltered. WHITE MIST broke a bit
slow, tossed his head into and early on the first turn, raced inside to the two path on the bends and also faltered.

Footnotes
SHACKLEFORD STRONG broke alertly and went clear early, showed the way in the two path through the turn, responded well and kicked clear when set
down in upper stretch, swapped back to his inside lead inside the furlong marker and drew off under steady urging. TAP ATTACK bumped with a rival at the
start then was hustled, chased the pace on the outside, made a bid while four wide on the turn, lost touch with the winner inside the three-sixteenths and
proved no match for the winner but held the place. SCHMOOZIN bumped with a rival at the start, was well placed in third position, saved ground on the turn,
was roused for his best in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. BREW CREW brushed with a rival at the start, was coaxed
along on the outside, went five wide under stronger encouragement on the turn, brushed with a foe into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. IN
SKY WE TRUST brushed with foes on both sides at the start, settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive, brushed with an opponent into the final furlong and failed to rally. SANGIO VASY brushed with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, went
three wide on the turn and faltered then was distanced in the final furlong. DESOTO'S WAR bumped with a rival at the start then was taken back, became
rank while hard held behind horses then checked near the half-mile pole, started the turn in the two path while still tugging hard at the bit, was taken way to
the outside nearing the five-sixteenths and eased but walked off.
