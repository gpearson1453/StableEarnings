OUR MUSICAL MOMENT showed good early speed and set the pace, drew off in upper stretch and was clearly best in the end. KISS MY GRITS chased
the early pace while three wide into the turn, rallied and made a bid but was second best. ISABELLE'S JOY chased the early pace while two wide, made a
bid then faltered. TRIP THE QUEEN was inside and saved ground on the turn and was no menace. ZELLA ROSE was unhurried early then raced four wide
in the stretch and was no menace. THAT LUVIN FEELING lunged at the start then raced four wide on the turn and lacked a rally.
