Footnotes
GALAXY THIRTYSIX was hustled from the start, moved up to take the lead midway down the backstretch then moved clear with a half-mile to run, extended
the advantage while inside on the far turn, responded well when asked at the three-sixteenths and proved much the best under steady urging. LUCKY LINZ
was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, drifted out under a left-handed crop coming to the furlong
marker then switched to a right-handed crop in pursuit of the winner and proved no match while able to get the place. CUSTOM FOR CARLITA settled
under some urging, went around the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive and improved position to get up for the show.
MONARCHOS PRAYER showed good speed on the outside and set the early pace, lost the lead to the winner midway down the backstretch then dropped
off the pace, was urged along in the three path on turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired. BLONDIE LOX BABE settled on the outside under
some urging, went four then three wide on the turn, drifted in near the furlong marker and failed to rally. CHERRY TWIST moved in early then back out
again, settled in third position, was urged four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under the crop and came up empty. KEHRON'S CREED
lacked early speed, angled in at the rear midway down the backstretch, raced inside on the turn and was no factor. FOR REAL ALICE was reluctant to load,
raced near the back while urged along, went five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LOVE BOUND settled on the
outside under some urging, went four wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
ARTISTIC JEWLER went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, lost the lead before the five-eighths then dropped just off the pace, went two
then three wide while asked on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch then took over while dropping in some at the three-sixteenths, responded well in
the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. SLIME QUEEN was taken in hand early, went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside,
went around the far turn in the two path, was asked in the three path into the stretch then made a bid under a drive, battled with the winner into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the place. DADDYMADEMEDOIT broke in and a step slow, went around the first turn in the two path, settled
off the pace, went around the far turn in the two path under some urging, came three wide into the stretch then lugged in some, was guided out just behind
the leaders at the three-sixteenths, chased the top two in the final furlong and was out-kicked while clear for the show. QUEEN OF THE LANE settled on the
inside, was asked leaving the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, checked behind horses nearing the three-sixteenths, was roused after finding
room shortly thereafter and lacked the needed response. BLACK KAT TAPS became rank under restraint early then checked into the first turn, went five
wide on that bend, was reserved on the outside, went four wide under urging on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and failed to rally.

wide under restraint on that bend, was reserved off the pace, went around the far turn in the two path under urging, swung five wide into the stretch and
failed to threaten. BEAUTIFUL BELLA was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, moved out leaving
the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. SNEAK PEEK went around the first turn in the three path,
moved to the lead before the five-eighths, vied inside on the far turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, spun into the two path entering the stretch then lost
the advantage and faded. (Rail at 8 Feet)

Footnotes
IMMORTAL went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, advanced three wide on the far turn, made a four wide bid into the stretch, shook off a
foe inside the furlong marker and drew clear under steady urging. SOUL COAXING went two to three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace,
traveled around the far turn in the two path, came between horses just inside the five-sixteenths, was driven four wide into the stretch and finished with good
courage to garner the place. AMES MISTER went three then two wide on the first turn, tugged at the bit while rated under restraint, went around the far turn
in the two path while let out, swung six wide into the stretch and was along for the show. AWESUMMER broke out at the start, went four wide on the first
turn, tracked the pace on the outside, went three wide on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, made a bid into the stretch, battled under a drive
into the final furlong and weakened. ONE TIME GEM went around the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace, saved ground on the far turn,
came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. SILENT STEVE saved ground on the first turn, was reserved at the back, went around the
far turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch, angled out into the final furlong then continued further out and failed to threaten. ANICLUDE was
hustled from the start, settled on the inside, was roused with three furlongs to run, hesitated behind horses in upper stretch, moved out outside the
sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. HALF COCKED broke a step slow, went four wide on the turns, came six wide into the stretch and was no
factor. CLEARLY MAD angled in while going to the front, set the pace on the inside, lost the lead into upper stretch and gave way. THE LAST OPTION
broke a step slow, went three to four wide on the turns, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond. (Rail at 8 Feet)

Footnotes
SOUTHERN SWAGG angled in while going to the front, dictated terms while inside to the two path through the turn, responded well when set down in upper
stretch and held under strong urging. BOOTH ROAD SHINE broke out and bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, moved from the inside to the three path
on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished willingly for the place. FIRE BLASTER tracked the pace on the outside, was asked while
three wide on the turn, chased into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong, drifted out around the sixteenth-pole and weakened while clear for the
show. ALMA DERBY settled on the outside, was urged four to five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. TAKEN BACK was off slow a couple
lengths slow, brushed with a foe outside the five-eighths, went five to six wide on the turn and failed to rally. PHILLY bumped with foes on both sides at the
start, raced just off the pace, went three wide on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop, was driven four wide into the stretch and came up
empty. GENERAL TONE brushed with a rival outside the five-eighths, settled under some urging, went three to four wide on the turn and failed to threaten.
CAEUS IN PASADENA bumped with an opponent at the start, was urged along at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, came four wide into the
stretch, moved out around the three-sixteenths and was no factor. ZENDELPHIAN was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the inside, dropped back
leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and retreated.
