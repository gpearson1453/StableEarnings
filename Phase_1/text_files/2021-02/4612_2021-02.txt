Footnotes
FRIENDLY OUTTHEDOR was unhurried while trailing to the second turn, circled rivals four wide to the stretch then rallied when set down, engaged for the
lead in mid stretch then dug in determinedly to inch clear. ALLEYCAT stalked the pace for a half mile, was three wide to the stretch then eased out widest
and closed fast to get the nod for second. KNOWN also was stalking the pace, raced three wide to the stretch then dueled the winner in mid stretch, got
bested by that one and tagged on the line for second. LINGUA FRANCA was allowed to settle to the half, raced off the rail on the second turn, was
outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. MERCY RULE hustled to the front, set the pace to the second turn then was overtaken and weakened in the final
furlong. ON THE WINGS OF was chasing to the second turn, bid two wide and briefly got in front nearing the quarter pole but was caught in upper stretch
and also weakened.

Footnotes
CLASSY CHASIE had no speed and trailed, saved ground on the second turn, rallied to the front in mid stretch then held on stubbornly. GEM STATE was
allowed to settle for a half mile, bid three wide then shifted out widest for the drive and closed willingly but too late. HYPERSONIC tracked the pace to the
second turn, bid three wide and rallied to contest the pace to mid stretch then was outfinished. PEQUENO MONTE pressed the leader to the second turn,
was off the rail while between rivals to the stretch then got outrun to mid stretch but kept on trying to the line. PRAISE LOUDLY was unhurried to the second
turn, raced two wide to the stretch then was also outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task to the wire. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET set the pace for six furlongs
then was overtaken into the stretch and tired. GOT TOBE AWESOME chased the pace for a half mile, gave way on the second turn and stopped in the
stretch.

Footnotes
LITTLE VICKY chased the leaders four wide to the stretch, shifted out, responded when set down then closed steadily and was up in the last jump. LA
VIKINA dueled for the lead outside a rival, drifted four wide into the stretch, responded when asked, battled to take a short lead late but was nailed by the
winner. ATLANTIC STRIKE hustled to contest the pace two wide to the stretch, dug in to deep stretch then was bested. KITTY'S CANDY tracked the pace
from the rail to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then could not offer the needed late response. GARDEN IN THE SKY had no speed, was three wide to
the stretch but never a threat. SUSY'S HEART had her turned behind a post in the starting gate when the latch was sprung, broke very poorly and was
always outrun. The stewards first reviewed the start then conducted an inquiry and decided that SUSY'S HEART did not receive a fair start and declared her
a non-starter for wagering purposes.

MARILYN'S SMILE was outrun and trailed to the turn, bid three wide then shifted out for room, rallied once clear and pushed to the front to prevail driving.
QUEEN HELENE was outsprinted to the turn, came two wide to the stretch then rallied inside rivals, dueled leaving mid stretch but could not stall the winner
but dug in to save second. MOMMY ROSE tracked the pace to the turn, was widest and circled five wide to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then was
outfinished. GO SMILEY GO stalked the pace early, rallied three wide to engage for the lead in mid stretch, dueled past the furlong grounds then weakened.
PREMIERE LADY had the best speed, set the pace in the two path to the stretch then was overtaken and tired. FELONY ONE was chasing the leader from
the rail to the stretch but also tired in the final furlong. JUST GRACE hustled to press the action outside rivals, was four wide on the turn but gave way in the
stretch.

Footnotes
PORTANDO was a pace factor inside rivals to the stretch, got outkicked by HOT ENCOUNTER to mid stretch but dug in determinedly to prevail. HOT
ENCOUNTER attended the pace four wide to the stretch, inched away to mid stretch but did not switch leads and was nailed on the line. MALIBU ALEX had
no speed, raced four wide to the stretch then shifted out and closed steadily. JENS DE VILLE also had no speed, was inside of MALIBU ALEX and three
wide to the stretch but finished in rally. KONA SKYE contested the pace between rivals and three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and
finished evenly. TIZ EMMA was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but lacked a closing response. IRISH TERRIER chased the pace
outside rivals, was forced out to the five path to the stretch and also did not rally. POTENTE ALBA attended the pace to the turn, was between rivals in the
two path to the stretch but tired in the drive.
