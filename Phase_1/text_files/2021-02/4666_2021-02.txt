terms in the stretch and continued gamely to the finish. CONFIRMED GENIUS chased close up inside, angled out on the turn, loomed a threat but tired late.
PERFECTA STORM trailed early, advanced inside then flattened out late. CLOUT CHASER dropped back in the two path and lacked a rally. LADY RYAN
raced wide, faded on the turn then passed tiring rivals. EMPRESS IRENE hustled to the lead down the backstretch then proved empty. LA LENA was urged

advanced inside on the final turn, moved out in the stretch closed well. PYLON held a clear advantage for nearly quarters then weakened slightly in the

abruptly. JAMMIN JAMIE chased outside and stopped losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
INSPIRING JUSTICE forced the pace outside, took over into the stretch then remained clear while kept to his task. AMI'S ARTIE lacked speed outside, split
rivals rallying strongly too late. GRAN CAUSEWAY dropped back early, moved inside on the turn and closed well. OTIS OTIS OTIS was urged close up
three wide and flattened out through the stretch. THE MINIT I SEE U saved ground off the leaders and lacked a rally. MAJESTIC JAZZ hustled to a narrow
advantage inside then proved empty in the stretch. JUMP SHOT dropped back outside and was never a factor. LOUIE'S WISH lagged well behind and was
always outrun. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL raced just off the leaders outside and stopped on the turn.

SOUPER FLY OVER pressed the pace in the early stages, then vied two wide for the lead, took over on the far turn, drew clear and held well under urging.
MIDNIGHT ACT raced off the pace, between horses throughout, rallied between rivals in the stretch run, dug in gamely in deep stretch and got the place
spot. TOWN JAK raced four wide early, then stalked three wide, raced three wide on the far turn, rallied near the inside, dug in gamely and missed second.
KADENS COURAGE was bumped at the start, steadied in tight quarters on the first turn, continued between rivals off the pace, came four wide into the lane
and rallied mildly outside. SHEER FLATTERY tracked close up on the inside, waited for room, was shuffled back on the far turn, lacked room and stumbled
at the five sixteenths marker, then rallied mildly inside. NILEATOR raced three wide off the pace, then chased four wide and weakened. WOODBURY was
bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, steadied nearing the quarter pole and closed belatedly inside. LUVINMEISEASY raced off the pace, moved
up five wide on the far turn, then flattened out. MONTELEONE raced five wide into the first turn, settled off the pace, went four wide on the far turn and did
not factor. DANCE FOR ORO raced four wide early, stalked three wide and faded. GUNS OF STEEL set the pace, then vied inside and gave way.

JEROME AVENUE took control before half a mile, drew away while in hand, drifted out through the stretch and lasted driving. MAGIC MICHAEL settled
outside, advanced inside on the final turn, angled back out and made a gradual late gain. SAMBAM saved ground throughout and closed well without
menacing. THE ROBERT lagged far behind then offered some energy too late. OVER SENSUAL dropped back early and lacked a solid rally. O'KRAM
saved ground close up for five furlongs and faded. INSTAFAMOUS set the pace inside for a quarter mile then gradually weakened. STAR SIGN chased
wide just off the leaders and gave way after the half. RUNNINGFORHOME raced wide within striking range briefly then stopped.

Footnotes
JONES TAXI trailed early, saved ground throughout, commenced his rally on the turn and was up in the final yards. TRULY A MOON SHOT forced the pace
outside, moved clear in mid-stretch but weakened. MANAHAWKIN raced far behind then closed with good energy inside. NICO BREE N TEEJ dueled along
the rail and continued well to the finish. SUNRISE SATURDAY settled just off the leaders inside and drifted out through the stretch. RINGS OF JUPITER
well placed outside the dueling leaders and flattened out in the stretch. ADULATION was urged close up three wide and proved empty in the stretch.
THESE BLUES lacked speed and was never in contention. BLINDING raced off the pace and steadily faded. A J'S WAY lacked speed and always outrun.
DEVINE DENTAL was a late scratch at the gate by the stewards on the advice of the track veterinarian.
