Footnotes
MADELYN'S WILD MAX unhurried in the early part, moved up on the outside around the turn, entered the stretch wide, rallied and got up in time.
WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG raced in the middle of the field, moved up, four wide around the turn, took the lead down the stretch and got caught late for
the win. AW SHUCKS dueled for the early advantage, challenged throughout, took the lead at the head of the lane, but proved no match for the top two.
HALFMOON REEF lacked early speed, racing in the back, showed late interest, four wide down the stretch and was no factor. CHEERS TO BERTI raced
near the back in the beginning, saved ground around the turn, made a mild bid, but was no threat. SUCCESSFUL RYKER raced in the middle of the pack
and put forth an even effort. ALLURING ACTOR dueled on the front end and was finished early. MAN CAMP vied for the early advantage, came around the
turn four wide and dropped back. BAYOU BODE always raced near the back and showed little. SKYLAS GOLD showed brief speed and stopped.

QUIKFAST N AHURRY unhurried in the early part, moved up on the outside around the final turn, dueled down the stretch and prevailed for the win.
SAINTS N MUSKETS vied for the early lead, being challenged by SARAH'S PASSION, took the lead entering the home stretch, dueled late with QUIKFAST
N AHURRY and was outfinished for the win. SNOWBALL reserved in the early going, made a steady gain, raced wide around the final turn and closed
willingly down the stretch. NET A BEAR raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid, racing on the rail, but was no factor. SHE'S GONE D'WILD lacked
early speed, showed late interest, but was no threat. MISS CHARLIE SIOUX raced within striking distance, saved ground, weakened and lacked a late bid.
SEBS PRINCESS hopped at the break, raced in the back, came around the second turn wide and was no threat. SARAH'S PASSION went to the front,
drove clear, saved ground and retreated to the rear. SMOK'N RITA always raced near the back and was outrun. MY LITTLE JEN pressed the early pace
and was finished early. THE JOCKEY OF #10 SAINTS N MUSKETS LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #9 QUIKFAST N AHURRY FOR
INTERFERENCE LEAVING THE FINAL TURN. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

UNDERPRESSURE unhurried in the early going, while saving ground, moved up between horses around the final turn, angled out entering the stretch, five
wide, rallied down stretch and proved the best. DOUBLE STAR went to the front, drove clear, saved ground, led until late, couldn't hold off the winner at the
wire. JIMI'S A STAR had a tight start, racing in the rear, came around the first turn on the outside, pressed the pace down the backside and proved third
best at the wire. GRAND LUWEGEE pressed the pace, saved ground, weakened and lacked a late bid. POUND FOR POUND was an early factor, forwardly
placed throughout and faded. CABO'S RUMOR void of early speed and passed tired ones. NIPPY RED raced within striking distance, came around the
second turn wide and retreated. SOCIAL AFLEET raced near the middle of the field, dropped back and was no threat.

command around the final turn, but couldn't match strides with the winner. MUCH CLASS pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and was
outfinished for second. PURIM KING raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, made a late gain, but was no factor. LUCKY INFERNO lacked early
speed, moved up, weakened and was no threat late. KRAFTY BOY raced near the back and showed little. LIAM SKYE raced in the middle of the field,
saved ground around the second turn and faded. JOHNNYSJOURNEY pressed the early pace and dropped back. GUITARZAN was fractious in the gates,
quickly went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and stopped.
