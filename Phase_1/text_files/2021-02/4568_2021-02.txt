ELUSIVE LOVE pressed the pace three wide, responded to mid stretch then dug in late to push clear from OUR EXPECTATION. The latter was outside the
winner, rallied four wide to the stretch, dueled to mid stretch then was outkicked but saved second. FREEPORT JOE got outsprinted to the turn, came three
wide to the stretch then could not impact the top two. GALLOPING UNO tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch then also failed to offer the needed
response. GEE GEE WHIZ was slow to settle, trailed while two wide to the stretch then did not threaten in the drive. SIZZLING INDIAN hustled to the front,
set the pace in the two path to the stretch then was overtaken in upper stretch and tired.

JEDI KNIGHT also was stalking while inside the winner, saved ground to the stretch then bid inside of SOUND CHECKERS, battled gamely and just
missed. SOUND CHECKERS set the pace while in the two path to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then got outkicked by the top two. IVORIAN had no
speed, raced two then three wide to the stretch, did not switch leads in the drive but was gaining slightly late. RED STAR also had no speed, got fanned
outside of IVORIAN and four wide to the stretch and also had a mild late bid.

I'M A COOL DUDE was chasing to the turn, shifted out and was two wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and wore down COWBOY KISSES late.
COWBOY KISSES dueled for the lead outside INDIANERA, was two wide to the stretch, inched away to mid stretch, responded but could not stall the
winner. SKY DINSKI had no speed, raced two then three wide to the stretch and finished in a mild rally. MOOGIE CAT was also chasing the leaders, came
three wide to the stretch, looked a threat in mid stretch but was outkicked to the line. INDIANERA ducked inward shortly after the start and was steadied
then hurried up to attend the pace inside the runnerup, stayed on to mid stretch then tired. SLEIGHT OF HOOF had no speed, was four wide on the turn
and never threatened.

the pace outside the winner and three wide, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task and saved the place. ACE AND KINGS tracked the pace to the
turn, bid three wide to the stretch, shifted in nearing mid stretch then lacked the needed late response. LOOKIN FOR GOLD was outrun early then steadied
off heels nearing the three eighths, saved ground to the stretch and finished willingly. LOCKWOOD had no speed, circled five wide to the stretch then did
not threaten in the drive. WALKING WITH DINO tracked the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then weakened. ERRIGAL chased the
pace in the two path to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
SHARMEL hopped at the start and was last to begin, commenced a bid three wide into the stretch, shifted out for room in upper stretch, responded to
pressure and wore down ALMA SPIRIT late. ALMA SPIRIT pressed the leader two wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in upper stretch, responded
stubbornly but could not hold. ABIGAIL ALDEN chased to the turn, was two wide to the stretch and closed some ground late. SASSY EINSTEIN had no
speed, got fanned four wide on the turn and did not threaten. KISS OF CONGRATS trailed while racing off the rail to the stretch then could only pick off
rivals in the drive. GREY ABBEY also had no speed, circled five wide to the stretch and was not a threat. HOLY CATHOLIC stalked the leader to the turn,
saved ground to the stretch but gave way in the drive. CAL'S GIRL hustled to the front, set the pace inside to the stretch then was overtaken and gave out.
ICE ANGEL was chasing to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then stopped.
