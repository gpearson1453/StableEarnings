SOMERSET BAY advanced along the rail to gain command after going a furlong and held stubbornly. JOHNY LIGHTNIN ducked out into LIFE MASTER
JIM leaving the gate, came out wide on the turn, remained wide into the stretch and couldn't get to the winner. DONTMESAWITHSISTER came out three
wide on the turn while moving, vied between the top two through the lane but lacked the needed closing response. LIFE MASTER JIM was bumped lightly
after the break, made the early pace outside, remained prominent two wide to the stretch then tired. TORRES DEL PAINE faded steadily and was eased up
through the final sixteenth.

HIS NAME IS SUE showed speed from the outset, moved clear midway on the backstretch, angled to the rail on the turn, remained clear past the sixteenth
pole and lasted while drifting slightly. CALCULATED THINKIN advanced the rail on the backstretch, was urged closer on the turn, came out for the drive,
closed a gap in late stretch but wasn't enough. MCPHERSON chased outside the winner and weakened in the lane. BREEZE BURNER was slow leaving
the gate, was hustled outside early, raced the three path around the turn and continued evenly. EYES ON ME raced wide around the turn and failed to
menace. WHITE BLUFF couldn't keep up.

horses and gained mildly. WELL BORN had position three wide but lacked the needed closing. UNBRIDLED MESA raced outside the winner into the far
turn then weakened. WHERE'S THE BEN'S was no factor. IMPOSSIBLE MISSION stumbled leaving the gate then was outrun. WELL IN TUNE stopped.
