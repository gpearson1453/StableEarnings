Footnotes
NOT PHAR NOW sparred for command from path two, inched away from the nemesis after the half had been rattled off, went into the lane and drew off as
much the best, handily. SIMBASALLTROUBLE rode the rail until the end of the bend, got sent out five to six wide from upper stretch to the three-sixteenths
pole, left that station having been switched over to stronger handling, bested the rest for the place. LIQUOR set up along the inside route, dueled with the
winner until the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, cut the corner into the stretch and retreated to third. WISECRACK two wide keeping watch on the
contested pace, angled approximately four wide into the lane, came up empty. WICKED KARMA two wide onto the turn, swung out five wide exiting it,
nearly trailed throughout. BLACK IRISH lost its rider after stumbling badly at the start, didn't appear to have an adverse effect on the race afterwards, was
apprehended by the outrider while still on the backstretch and subsequently walked back to the paddock. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the start
of the race, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

advancing on the once clear leader in tandem with the field to take over command three furlongs from home, got set down spinning four to five wide into
upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. HARDCORE FOLKLORE coaxed from the gate, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch,
went five wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, continued five wide for home, proved no match for the top one while running on clear of
the rest to be along second best. CLASSY PAPA five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and
weakened in the final furlong. MILLS eight to nine paths off the inside down the backstretch, went six wide through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs
out, continued six wide into upper stretch and weakened. KAMPAI spurted away in hand two wide down the backstretch, went three wide into the turn and
had the field advance, got placed to urging headed for the front three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
HALO CITY away without apparent mishap, stalked the pace towards two to three wide during the run around the bend, flashed some interest as
three-quarters was being completed, angled about five wide into the lane and took off in earnest after the ones to catch, clawed her way towards them,
wrested away the advantage in the final seventy yards and edged clear. MAGNETIQUE sparred for the top from path two, bid while one path wider coming
the lane, battled onward with willingness, ultimately having to settle for second. COUSIN BASIL argued for the top from along the inside route for six
furlongs, was more in the two path when set down at the head of the stretch, weakened late into the show slot after being overhauled past the sixteenth
marker. NEW YORK ROCK STAR chased the pact two to three wide, got sent out into path six from upper to midstretch, lacked the necessary response.
CHAYSENBRYN saved ground for the initial three-quarters, got moved out into path five early during the stretch run, had no rally. WICKED AMBER three
wide on the turn, was swung into path five exiting it, never made her presence felt.

Footnotes
FIRST LINE three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch,
rallied to take command inside the three-sixteenths and went clear under a drive to prevail. OPEN LENGTHS hustled from the gate, raced two to three wide
through the first turn in closest aim of the leader before advancing four paths off the inside down the backstretch to apply pressure, tucked three wide
through the far turn dueling with the leader coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in head to head and was overhauled
in concert with SOCIAL GROUP inside the three-sixteenths, then weakened through to the finish while winning the battle for the place honors. SOCIAL
GROUP hustled from the gate, showed the way crossed to the inside through the first turn, came under steadily increasing pressure from the
aforementioned foe to the outside and knocked heads through the far turn with that rival placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for
home, got displaced as a pair from the front inside the three-sixteenths, continued to knock heads to the finish with OPEN LENGTHS and was ultimately
bested for the place honors while well clear of the rest for the show. AMISTAD four wide through the first turn, chased five then four wide coaxed along from
the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. TRUE PALACE two then three wide through the first turn, briefly went four wide before
chasing six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the far turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung seven wide for home
and tired. SUPER WICKED CHARM chased two to three wide coaxed along from midway on the far turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no
impact. FIRST DAWN lunged at the start, recovered to chase along the inside through the opening bend before chasing two to three wide down the
backstretch, went four wide through the far turn coaxed along from midway, angled six wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. JUDGE
ALEXANDER coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
folded.

Footnotes
TATWEEJ well off the inside route, pursued the front runners four wide on the turn, commenced the stretch by spinning one path wider, kicked into his best
and closed the gap, struck the front end narrowly by the beginning of the final furlong, vied on near even terms with the second place finisher for a little while
longer before drawing clear. DREAMS UNTOLD contended for the top towards the two path, ventured into path four when set down for the stretch run,
relinquished in midlane, fought for a few extra strides, stayed on for second. ROCK ON LUKE bumped lightly with MAD MUNNYS right after the field had
been released, assumed a forward position, was in path three contending for the top, got switched over to a drive at the five-sixteenths pole, lost contact
with the top twosome during the stretch drive, saved the show. SUNNY RIDGE departed the backstretch from path two, went about the bend under some
hand encouragement, swung out about four wide into the lane, continued onward to the wire mildly urged. MAD MUNNYS tracked the pace while saving
ground, going about the task without much cover, came under a drive crossing the midway point on the turn, stepped into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
SOMEBODY five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing between foes at the five-sixteenths as
a quartet stacked up behind the top pair, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong and
was up in the last seventy yards to collar the leader before inching away to the finish. MUCH TROUBLE hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand four
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide
into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat and was caught seventy yards from home.
FINANCIALSTABILITY coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, kept
on to secure the show honors. MONTAUK DADDY coaxed from the start, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader,
tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened in the final furlong. JAKE ROCKS
chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing midway on the turn, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and
offered no response. NEW FRONTIER seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coaxed along from the
three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. KNOCKOUT PUNCH chased three then two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out,
spun four wide for home and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
JEMOGRAPHY tracked the front runners from along the inside route for the opening half, angled five wide for racing room heading into the lane, kicked into
its best stride, emerging at the eighth pole as the main threat to FOOLISH GHOST, continued to chop away at the deficit in a steadfast manner, struck the
front end with four jumps or so to spare and edged clear. FOOLISH GHOST retained the advantage after out-breaking the competition, showed the way,
firmly rated in path two and with TOOK CHARGE in accompaniment out in path three, was coming up to the three-sixteenths pole when called upon for
more, began the last eighth in possession of what turned out to be his largest advantage, put up resistance before finally getting reeled in a short distance
from the finish line. REJECTED AGAIN pursued the pace parked out four wide on the turn, got sent out into path six for the drive, maintaining its status of
being practically the widest of all throughout, had a good finish down the center of the strip to secure the show. MORNING BREEZ guided onto the inside
route at the top of the lane, swung out three wide heading for the three-sixteenths marker, mustered up a mild response sufficient enough to lay claim to the
last major check. TOOK CHARGE pressed the pace three wide for a half before giving way. INSTINCTIVE RHYTHM off approximately a length the tardiest
after lunging out at the start, travelled three wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the inside, failed to menace. INSCOM kept watch
on the pace from path two, was through after going a half.

Footnotes
BINGO JOHN six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun three
wide for home, came in slightly bumping BLURT at the three-sixteenths, rallied to take command a furlong from home, dug in under a drive tussling with the
runner up before inching away to the finish. MY BROTHER NEIL brushed at the start by INTERSTATE due to pressure from the breaking inwards BIG
LUTHER, tussled briefly with a rival then showed the way in hand four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive headed for the front a furlong out, fought on to the finish getting shaken
off in the final jumps. FULL MOON FEVER five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung five wide for home and offered up a mild kick. BREW PUB chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun
three wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. BLURT tussled briefly for command before prompting the leader from the
outside in the five path, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, got bumped at
the three-sixteenths by BINGO JOHN, who came inwards and weakened. STREET CULTURE eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, commenced
a four wide advance into the turn to get into striking distance when placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, couldn't sustain the
momentum and tired. INTERSTATE got bumped at the start by BIG LUTHER who broke inwards and in turn brushed MY BROTHER NEIL, chased three
wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and made no impact. RUMDUM BYDA SEA chased just off the inside
until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. BIG LUTHER broke
in at the start brushing the near side stall before bumping INTERSTATE into MY BROTHER NEIL, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then five wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, continued five wide for home and faltered.
