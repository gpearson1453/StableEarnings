AMAZON BARBIE raced back early on, began a rally along the far turn, was in the six path entering the lane, continued the rally down the lane, dug in late
and prevailed in the final stages. SOUTHAMPTON DOCK tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, took over and led three wide near the
eighth pole, dug in but did not have enough in the final stages. BIG DIG raced back early on, came up the inside entering the lane while making a bid,
continued the bid from the rail down the lane but hung in the late stages. JUNOESQUE chased the pace early, rallied along the far turn, was in the five path
into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. LASERJET was a tad slow at the start, raced in the three path into the lane, made a
bid in the stretch but leveled off late in the drive. RESILIENT BEAUTY chased the pace early, was shuffled back along the far turn from the rail, came again
and moved up late in the stretch run. BOLTS BABE set the pace early, was in the two path into the lane and faltered late in the stretch drive.
STUPENDOUS was never a threat. KEEP IT SEXY was through after three quarters. DELOVELY chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane
and empty down the lane. ENGLISH CHARM had early speed then folded up.
