Footnotes
FAMOUS ROCK STAR confidently handled along the inside on the backstretch behind clear leader, eased out into the two path on the turn, took aim in the
four path, kept under a drive and grinded closer mid stretch, and got up on the very last head bob to prevail. RESTLESS RAMBLER sent clear on the
backstretch, continued clear on the turn, entered lane clear, met rivals bid in mid stretch, dug in and just caught at the wire. OBVIOUS tracked clear rival off
the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, launched bid widest in the lane, failed to improve while easily being third best. ELUSIVE
VIRTUE settled in between rivals in the backstretch, went to rail entering the turn and lacked needed improvement in the lane. B D R DRAGSTER asked
and failed to show enough speed to contend early, settled three wide into the turn and lacked needed rally in the lane to improve. DIVINELY DIVERSE
broke in two paths at the start, settled along the inside, shuffled when rivals came in entering the turn, took the turn in the three path and never threatened.

Footnotes
FLASH BAK away cleanly, midpack early with EMPRESSUM, asked right handed to pass EMPRESSUM passing the gap, asked again midway, responded
well and started to pull away in the final sixteenth in a convincing win. EMPRESSUM brushed with outside rival at the start, away well enough, asked right
handed early, asked again midway, drifted out a path and finished well enough to be second best. A TRES OF EAGLE away midpack, asked right handed
early, in range and kept to a drive to the wire to win a photo for third. JERIKO away in the rear of the field, kept his path, asked right handed and finished
well to lose a photo for third. TAKE A SWIG OF THIS away well, mild drifting early, kept under a hand drive most of the way, lugged out three lanes late
while being outfinished. SHOTT GUN away second best, asked right handed early, put in tight passing the sixteenth and weakened. APOLLITICAL PENCE
away super, briefly cleared, lugged in when asked right handed, and lost his hind end, lost all momentum and kept on gamely to the wire . HOOKED N
GONE brushed outside part of the gate, came out two paths, asked right handed early, bobbled and just never looked comfortable while never getting on
track. SCOOPS DYNASTY was fidgety in the gate, reared and came away slowly to lose all chance WHISKEY CREEK broke in, and brushed with
EMPRESSUM, asked left handed early, and started to lean out into SHOTT GUNS PATH, lost his path and kept under a light ride to the wire.
