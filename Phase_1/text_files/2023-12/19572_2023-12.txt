Footnotes
PRECEDENT LUKE assumed command away from the start, was well rated through modest fractions along the backstretch run, confronted by WE CAN at
the quarter marker, battled with that rival into the stretch, came again to take the lead at the furlong pole, drifted out into deep stretch, was kept to task into
the final stages and held in a drive to prevail. LONG JACKET unhurried leaving the start, settled while saving ground into the backstretch run, maintained an
inside path into the far turn, offered a sustained rally through the stretch, could not reel in the winner in the late stages and held safely for second. TWELVE
VOLT forwardly placed in the early stages, took back into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace from the second flight, gained ground three
wide at the quarter marker, raced four wide into the stretch then shifted in inside of the furlong marker, was gaining in deep stretch and was up in time to
secure third. RIGHT HAND RYDER allowed to settle, tracked outside of rivals to the second turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, was gaining in the
final furlong but needed more in the late stages and was outfinished for third. WE CAN close up to the moderate pace, tracked outside of PRECEDENT
LUKE to the far turn, took a narrow lead at the quarter marker, battled with PRECEDENT LUKE into the lane, lacked a response in the late stages and
weakened in deep stretch. TREE HUGGER a bit keen early, stalked the modest pace while saving ground to the second turn, tipped two wide for the drive,
lost ground at the furlong pole and weakened. RANDY'SFURRYFRIEND took back off of the moderate pace, was asked for run three wide into the stretch
and did not factor.

Footnotes
A ROUSING BABE unhurried away from the start, tracked outside of runners into the turn and was coaxed along three wide to the quarter marker, came in
a bit tight into upper stretch and angled four wide for the drive, rallied at the furlong marker, responded to urging into deep stretch, surged in the final strides
and won the nod on the wire to prevail. RAVEN'S QUEST close up in the opening stages, took back and tracked the solid pace into the turn, loomed three
wide at the quarter marker and battled for the lead into the stretch, gained command and took a narrow advantage to the sixteenth-marker, dug in into deep
stretch and was tagged for the win in the final strides. FIVE O COCKTAIL took back off of the solid early pace and tracked from the inside, came in tight
approaching the turn and was shuffled back at the three-furlong marker, chased to the quarter pole then swung five wide for the drive, closed willingly while
widest in deep stretch and was up in time to secure third. LAURA BRANIGAN prominent in the early running, stalked the solid pace into the turn then
advanced to press the pace two wide at the quarter pole, battled for the lead into the stretch, fought back into the final sixteenth, came in a bit tight and
steadied in deep stretch and could not muster a late response. PACIFIC ZIP rated off of the solid early pace, gained ground into the turn then came in tight
while two wide nearing the top of the stretch, raced in traffic to the furlong grounds, found room into the late stages but lacked a late response. BLURSDAY
sent to establish the early lead, showed good speed while dictating terms into the turn, pressed by LAURA BRANIGAN to the quarter marker, was overtaken
into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
FRIED ASPARAGUS broke well and vied for the early lead outside of SHE'S SO SHINY, then floated a bit wide on the clubhouse turn and was content to
stalk just off the flank of that rival to the far turn, took command passing the three furlong marker and won clear while under a drive to the line. SHE'S SO
SHINY broke well and seized the lead and the rail, was allowed to set reasonable fractions while under a snug hold from the rider, tried to slip away with
three furlongs to run but could not hold off the challenge of FRIED ASPARAGUS, kept on under steady handling and held well in the end for second.
DOWNBURST was unhurried early tracking well behind the top pair, came under a drive from the three furlong pole, mounted a four wide rally into the
stretch, closed well in the drive and missed for second, while holding clearly for third. TEN THE SMART WAY lunged at the start and was off slowly, rushed
up into the first turn and stalked the decent pace from a two wide path into the backstretch, chased the leading pair into the far turn, raced three wide into
stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker and tired in the final stages. SMOKEMS TAPHOUSE unhurried in the early stages, trailed to the far turn, rallied in
the final furlong but failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
MY YAMMY LADY forwardly placed into the first turn, rated into the backstretch run and tracked to the half-mile marker while not far back, asked for run
heading to the quarter marker and mounted a four wide bid into the stretch, took command in upper stretch and extended the lead at the furlong marker, felt
mild late pressure from the runner-up and held safely in a drive to prevail. SHEZARUNAWAY unhurried in the early going, saved all of the ground to the
second turn, came in a bit tight at the quarter marker and swung widest for the drive, rallied five wide at the quarter marker, closed willingly into deep
stretch, pressured the winner in the final stages but could not reel in MY YAMMY LADY and was second best in the end. PROOF OF JAZZ stumbled away
from the start, quickly recovered and assumed command in the early stages, set moderate fractions into the backstretch run and dictated terms into the far
turn, came under pressure into the stretch, lost the lead to MY YAMMY LADY and chased that rival to mid-stretch, could not match strides with the top two
in deep stretch, weakened and held for third at the finish. BREVE forwardly placed in the early going, tracked the pace three wide along the first turn and
was well positioned while tracking the moderate pace heading to the half-mile pole, raced two then three wide to the quarter marker, chased to the furlong
grounds and gave way in the final stages. VRONSKY FEINT close up while between runners in the early stages, tracked the moderate pace through the
backstretch run, came in tight into the second turn and checked at the quarter marker, chased the leaders into upper stretch and did not offer a late
response.

Footnotes
PLAYBOY STYLE forwardly placed away from the start, tucked in into the first turn and settled two wide into the backstretch run, was content to trail to the
half-mile marker then was asked for run four wide along the far turn, shifted to the five path into the stretch and advanced at the furlong marker, responded
to urging into the final sixteenth and mounted a bold late rally, confronted LAURA'S KIDOUGH in the final strides and got up at the finish to determinedly
prevail. LAURA'S KIDOUGH settled four wide into the first turn, gained ground at the half-mile marker and improved position four wide at the quarter pole,
came within aim in upper stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, battled with VINNIEBOB into the final sixteenth, took a slim lead in deep stretch
and was nailed on the line for the win, while just holding for the place at the finish. VINNIEBOB forwardly placed away from the start, tracked three wide
along the first turn then tracked between runners into the backstretch, made a middle move and slipped to the rail nearing the far turn, was well placed while
saving ground at the quarter marker, loomed nearing the top of the lane and took command inside of the three-sixteenths, dug in while leading into the final
sixteenth, could not hold off the top pair in deep stretch and was gamely bested for the win and place, while well clear for the show. UPRIGHT away in good
order and prominent to begin, took back to track the early pace and raced outside of rivals into the backstretch run, maintained an outside path while
tracking to the half-mile pole, mounted a three wide bid at the quarter marker, lost ground at the furlong pole and flattened out in the late stages. LEVON
asked for speed away from the start and assumed command into the first turn, pulled on the rider and opened to a clear lead into the backstretch run, set
decent fractions to the half-mile marker and dictated terms into the far turn, came under pressure at the top of the stretch, battled to the furlong grounds,
could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened. THE SLAP forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the decent pace from a three wide path
along the first turn, raced between runners through the backstretch run and was coaxed along three wide and between runners into the far turn, came in
tight and was boxed in at the quarter marker, found room into the stretch and chased to the furlong grounds, was outrun into the final sixteenth and did not
offer a late rally. L L L COOL forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the decent pace into the backstretch run, was well positioned at the half-mile
marker and chased two wide into the far turn, lost ground into the stretch and gave way. UPDRAFT tracked the early pace from the second flight, was well
positioned heading to the half-mile marker, could not keep pace into the second turn and did not threaten. STOUT fractious prior to the start, was unhurried
and saved ground into the first turn, settled through the backstretch run and raced two wide into the far turn, was asked for run four wide into the drive and
did not factor.

DULY NOTED allowed to settle away from the start, tracked the decent pace between runners into the turn and raced three wide to the quarter marker, was
roused four wide into the stretch and was full of run approaching the furlong grounds, vied for the lead inside of the furlong pole and battled with
BROADWAY TIGER into the final sixteenth, repelled the runner-up in deep stretch and edged away in the end to prove best. BROADWAY TIGER broke
sharply, conceded the early lead and tracked the solid pace into the turn, advanced two wide along the bend and pressed HOT AND SPICY to the quarter
marker, took command into upper stretch and was set down for the drive, held foes at bay to mid-stretch then drifted out inside of the furlong marker, met
the bid of DULY NOTED into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by the winner in deep stretch and was clear in the end for second. SHANA MADEL tracked
the solid early pace three wide, was steered two wide into the turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch and
continued her advance at the furlong marker, raced in tight quarters inside of the furlong marker, took up nearing the sixteenth-pole and was not able to
match strides with the top pair in deep stretch, while clear of the rest for third. STAY UP allowed to settle away from the start, tracked outside of runners in
the early stages then shifted to the rail along the turn, chased from the inside heading to the quarter marker then swung five wide for the drive, could not
muster the needed response in deep stretch and passed tiring rivals late. LITTLE NAUGHTY close up in the early going, chased the solid pace between
runners into the turn then slipped to the rail while in pursuit heading to the quarter pole, chased from the inside into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong
marker and lacked a late response. VELOCIOUS crowded at the start and was away a step slowly, chased the solid early pace from the inside, became
rank and hard to place and steadied approaching the turn, was steered two wide to the quarter marker and raced three wide into the stretch, ran evenly to
the furlong marker and tired in the final sixteenth. HOT AND SPICY hustled to assumed command in the early going, showed good speed while dictating
terms into the turn, was pressed through solid fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch, battled to the furlong marker and faded in the
late stages. DIVINE GIFT chased outside of runners in the early stages, improved position four wide approaching the quarter marker, maintained that four
wide path into the stretch, was outrun to the furlong marker and did not threaten in the final stages. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
RUNNING IN DEEP STRETCH. THE STEWARDS RULED THAT BROADWAY TIGER DRIFTED INTO THE PATH OF SHANA MADEL INSIDE OF THE

GABBY HAYES broke a step slow then took up a few strides out of the gate, dropped to last then moved to the outside for clear running, made steady
forward progress through the turn, bid three wide through the turn and responded to strong handling down the stretch to prevail. OUR BOLD PRINCE was
keen from the outset and pressed the early pace three deep while under a stout hold, was let loose after passing the three furlong marker, took the lead
briefly in the stretch, ran on gamely to the wire but was outfinished by the winner. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD broke well then was stuck three to four wide down
the backstretch, launched a bid from the seven-sixteenths pole but was boxed in somewhat then stuck behind horses passing the three sixteenths, swung
out for room mid-stretch and finished well under strong handling to gain third. AFFECTIONTO AUTISM raced close up and to the inside through the early
going, struggled to keep up with the pace through the turn, responded to strong handling down the stretch but was not good enough. SATANTA was allowed
to settle into stride, bided time behind horses to the turn, was asked to pick up the pace from the five-sixteenths pole but did not immediately respond,
drifted in under pressure approaching the furlong marker, impeded BOBBY'S ALIBI, then swung out for room in deep stretch but was too late to make an
impact. TORPEDO AWAY settled well behind the pace early, saved ground throughout, made a mild rally in the stretch. GROWTH ENGINE broke sharply
and set a pressured pace to the turn, hung in to the stretch then gave way approaching the eighth pole. BOBBY'S ALIBI broke well and was prominent in
the early going, backed off from potential traffic near the seven-sixteenths pole, attempted to re-rally from that point was making some progress mid-stretch
then steadied hard at the eighth pole and lost all chance. HIJO GALANTE was outrun from the break, angled over to the two path when clear, chased the
field to the wire and never made an impact.

HARMON was allowed to settle into stride near the back of the pack, stayed outside in the clear down the backstretch, circled the field on the far turn, came
seven wide into the stretch and ran on well under steady handling to get up in time. BUENISIMO unhurried while racing three wide through the clubhouse
turn, settled mid-pack down the backstretch, launched a bid from just before the five-sixteenths pole, swung five wide into the stretch and produced a steady
rally to gain second. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE was a little slow to get into stride but recovered quickly and raced just behind the leading pair through the
early stages while saving ground, responded to strong handling from the five-sixteenths marker, kept to task and gained the third spot. IL CAPITANO came
away well and had good natural speed, stalked the pace set by BRONZE WARRIOR to the far turn, took command passing the five-sixteenths pole, held
gamely to deep stretch but was outfinished near the wire. SUGAR BEETS allowed to settle from the break, raced at the rear of the field through the early
going, idled behind horses through the far turn waiting for running room, came four wide into the stretch with some run then had to steady sharply just past
the eighth pole, managed to re-rally but came up short. BABY FRANKIE was not asked for speed from the gate and settled near the rear, was held up down
the backstretch run, saved ground, looked to get into the clear on the far turn but was blocked from doing so by horses to the outside, bided time through the
far turn and into deep stretch then did not have a response when clear in the last sixteenth. RESPECT THE HUSTLE tracked the early pace racing three to
four wide through the first half -mile, was put into a drive from the seven-sixteenths pole, had to steady mid-stretch when in tight quarters, lost momentum
and finished evenly. BRONZE WARRIOR broke sharply and was hustled hard for the lead, was pressed by IL CAPITANO to the far turn, had no response
when that foe bid for the lead near the five-sixteenths pole then had nothing left for the stretch run.

JAIME'S COMMITMENT broke alertly and was prominent away from the start, took back to track the solid early pace and was well positioned heading to the
turn, waited for racing room while two wide approaching the quarter marker, found room into upper stretch and was asked for run nearing the furlong
marker, confronted AS LUCK HAPPENS and battled with that rival to mid-stretch, took command and was asked for more into the final sixteenth, dug in
while under pressure in deep stretch and just lasted for the win at the finish. SMARTY NOSE forwardly placed early on, tracked the solid pace and was
steered outside of runners heading into the turn, chased four wide to the quarter marker and maintained a four wide path into the stretch, loomed at the
furlong marker and rallied into the final sixteenth, closed willingly in deep stretch, pressured the winner in the final strides and just missed for the win at the
finish, while besting the rest. R HEART OF GOLD allowed to settle early on, saved ground into the turn and maintained an inside path into the stretch,
finished well in the final furlong and won the nod for third at the wire. COUNTRY BOY rated nicely off of the solid early pace, was coaxed along two wide
along the turn then shifted four wide into upper stretch, rallied in the final sixteenth and just missed for third at the finish. AS LUCK HAPPENS asked for
speed leaving the break, assumed command in the early going and set a solid pace while pressured into the turn, shook free while carving quick fractions
nearing the quarter marker, met the bid of JAIME'S COMMITMENT into the stretch and battled with the winner to the furlong marker, could not keep pace
into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. ONE BIG SMILE chased the solid early pace from the inside, angled three wide nearing the quarter
marker and lost ground nearing the top of the lane, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not offer a late rally. ZEE CARROT EAGLE hustled away from the
start, raced close up to the solid early pace and saved ground approaching the turn, lost position at the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the
