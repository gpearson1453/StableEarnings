Footnotes
DAKOTA SPRINGS sprinted to the lead to set all the pace and fended off the late running outside rival and held on for the win. REIGERT GIRLS showed no
early speed while racing inside but ran into traffic on the turn and angled out to three wide in upper stretch for a late rally. STORMIN HEIST chased the
leaders from the inside but lacked a late response but was best of others. CARSONS COOL WOMEN raced three wide through out and was not a threat.
PYROTECHNICS raced near the back early then moved between horses at the three furlong marker for a mild bid on the turn but was empty in the stretch.
STAY SINGLE was fractious in the gate then hopped inward leaving the starting gate, hustled up to press the pace from the two path and gave way midway
through the turn.

Footnotes
JACK'S LILLY tracked the leaders from the two path but fell back on the turn, made a rebid and moved out to three wide in upper stretch for a late rally and
drew clear. TERPEYE was off slow and spotted the field several lengths and trailed to the top of the stretch then moved out to five wide in upper stretch for
a strong late run to just get up for the place. GREEN GABLES hustled to the lead from off the rail to the turn then tipped inside on the turn started to tire in
the stretch but held the show. SHATTER ME prompted the pace from the inside to the turn then from the two path but was outfinished in the stretch.
STORMY SPELL raced off the pace on the inside to the turn then moved up from between horses for a mild bid but lacked the late response. TILTED
TIARA hopped out of the gate then rushed up the rail and tired at the end of the bend. SEVEN YEARS LATER hesitated leaving the gate then was hustled
to contention from three wide but gave way on the turn.

SECRETARY AT WAR prompted the pace from the two path down the backstretch then moved up to engage the leader at the three furlong marker and
took command at the eighth pole and drew off. EASY SHOT was allowed to settle down the backstretch then made a bid starting at the three eighths pole
and was closing but was no match for the winner. DEVOTED KITTEN was allowed to settle well off the pace down the backstretch, launched a bid at the
three furlong marker and tipped out to three wide in the stretch to improve position. FED CHAIR went to a clear lead down the backstretch then was headed
at the three furlong marker and fought gamely around the turn and tired. TRUE DAKOTAN trailed and was not a factor.

UNFETTERED DIVA showed no speed to mid turn while saving ground then angled out to three wide in upper stretch and ran down the leader to be up in
the final jumps. KELLY'S PARTY GIRL raced off the pace from four wide moved up to engage the leader nearing the top of the stretch then took the lead at
the eighth pole and drew clear but was caught in the final jumps. CURLIN'S DOVE went to a clear lead to midway through the turn then was headed near
the top of the stretch and gave way grudgingly but proved best of the rest. MY SWEET SUMMER rushed up the rail to press the pace to the half mile marker
and slowly faded. DISCO DAISY rushed up to be in contention from between horses to be off the the pace, made a mild bid on the turn and weakened.

JEANETTEO went to an unchallenged lead to set all the pace and was kept to task in the drive. QUEEN'S DREAM raced off the pace from the inside and
cut the corner into the stretch to be second best. LIVIN' AT THE BU prompted the pace from the two path but lacked the last response. SALAGADOOLA
was unhurried throughout and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. PRUSSIAN BLUE stalked the pace from three wide but failed to menace.

Footnotes
THE METHOD stalked the pace down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn to engage the leader and dueled down the stretch and
won the nod. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE vied for the lead from the inside down the backstretch and took command into the final turn but was headed into the
stretch and dueled to the wire and lost photo. TEMPESTUOUS was rank early, settled near the back then made a bid from between horses at the quarter
pole for a late rally. THE GREAT CASBY saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack, made a mild bid on the final turn but flattened out. NOBLE
CONQUEST broke outward, vied for lead from between horses to the half mile marker then faded on the final turn and finished evenly. LAKE NAKURU was
pinched back after the break then was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack, made a three wide bid at the half mile marker while racing evenly.
PURPLE SHIRT trailed and was never a threat. CLOSER LOOK rushed up to take the lead for the first half and was done, distanced, eased.
