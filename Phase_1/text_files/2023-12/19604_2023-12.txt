SWEET LAURA was allowed to settled down the backstretch then made a bid into the final turn going four wide and took command at the top of the stretch
to draw clear. BAR TAP raced in the middle of the pack to the final turn then move up from three wide and tipped out to five wide in upper stretch for a late
rally to be second best. ATOMIC ROSE went to the front to co-lead from between horses to the quarter pole and was challenged to the top of the stretch,
fought gamely to mid stretch and weakened. FASTED rushed up to be in striking distance down the backstretch then vied for the lead from three wide and
took a brief lead at the quarter pole but was overtaken at the three sixteenths and tired. CARPE HORSESHOE went to the front to co-lead from the inside to
the quarter pole and faded. KATIE'S KARAT raced off the pace on the inside to the final turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
PUGLIA was allowed to settled to the first turn then steadily advance to circle the field and drove past the leaders to prove best. FROSTY BREW sprinted
away to a clear lead around the first turn while lugging out slightly, kept the lead but was headed at the three furlong marker, lugged out on the final turn and
kept on gamley to hold on for the place. CAJUN ACES raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then moved up from four wide on the backstretch
and slipped through at the top of the stretch but lacked the late kick needed. SENSE OF FLURRY was within striking distance down the backstretch then
moved up to engage the leader at the three furlong marker but was forced out into the stretch and tired. SARA'S SAPPHIRE raced off the pace from the
inside then slipped through entering the stretch but failed to sustain the bid. KELLYS THE BOSS raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then
made a mild bid on the backstretch but was never a threat. SPLICER was always back. LADY ENVOY saved ground to no avail.

ROCK SOLID WORDS raced off the pace and moved up from three wide at the three furlong marker, matched strides with K R POWER STORM and DR
SPECK around the turn and took a narrow lead at the three sixteenths pole and dueled down the stretch with K R POWER STORM and was just up. K R
POWER STORM went to the front to a challenged lead, headed at the three furlong marker and matched strides inside of DR SPECK and ROCK SOLID
WORDS but came again to battled with ROCK SOLID WORDS in the stretch but lost the nod. DR SPECK pressed the pace from the two path and engaged
the leader at the three furlong marker and dueled between K R POWER STORM and ROCK SOLID WORDS to the three sixteenths pole and weakened.
MYMANROWEN raced near the back to the turn then made a four wide bid on the turn and kept on to improve his position. CATALINA DAY was forwardly
placed on the backstretch then chased the dueling trio on the turn but made up ground in the stretch but had no impact. SUIT OF WANDS chased the
leaders from the inside and was closing late but was not a factor. GRAY DANE had no speed and was not a threat.

SAN JUAN HILL was steadied into the first turn then was allowed to settle on the backstretch and made a rail bid on the final turn, angled out to three wide
at the eighth pole and ran down the leader to be up in the final jumps. HALF A BUCK stalked the pace from the inside then made a bid into the turn and
tipped out to two wide and engaged the leader at the top of the stretch and drew clear but was caught in the final jumps. SHADY GRADY broke well then
was taken back going into the first turn and was allowed to settle down the backstretch and made a rail bid on the final turn and in the stretch to be up for
the show. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail then moved out the three wide on the final turn for a mild late rally.
NOCOMET floated out going into the first turn then saved ground down the backstretch, angled out to four wide around the final turn tipped out to five wide
in upper stretch to improve his position late. ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE was rushed to the lead to the first turn then matched strides with JANET'S DEVIL to
the three furlong marker then edged away on the final turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and tired. G'S STORM was off a step slow then raced
near the back and failed to menace. DOUBLE PRIORITY raced in the middle of the pace and was not a threat. CLASSIC RED RACER raced off the pace to
the final turn then moved out to three wide on the final turn but gave way. JANET'S DEVIL as hustled along to press the pace from the two path around the
first turn then matched strides with ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE to the three furlong marker and stopped, distanced.
