Footnotes
TOUISSET saved ground setting a pressured pace around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and lasted. TRITONE GAL raced along the inner rail around
the turn and through the stretch, had aim on the lead in mid stretch then hung. GOLDIENESS , three deep prompting the pace around the turn, flattened
out. GENIEINABRIDLE lacked speed, was two wide on the turn, swung to the five path in mid stretch and rallied mildly. LEVISA prompted the pace outside
the winner and weakened. TURN ON THE CHARM lacked speed in the two path on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and failed to rally.
STEPHANIE MY LOVE , a very brief factor along the inner rail down the backstretch, drifted very wide entering the stretch.

Footnotes
CAGED PIXIE broke a step slow, recovered and edged up between rivals early on, secured the rail into the far turn, was patiently handled within range mid
turn, came off the inside leaving the quarter pole, moved to command a furlong out, repelled an outside threat and drew clear under a drive. CONGRESS
HALL settled off the early pace and off the inside, angled out mid turn, circled rivals six wide into the lane, ranged up to threaten the winner in mid stretch,
could not match strides with that one but stayed willingly to save the place. ILLUSION OF HOPE rated towards the inside, took closer order when angling
past the three eighths, dropped back to the rail leaving the quarter pole, moved up to pose a presence past the furlong grounds but flattened out very late.
LUCKY LORRAINE was checked sharply to avoid CHALK HILL nearing the five eighths, regrouped into the turn, circled four wide into the stretch, shifted
out in upper stretch and churned on. HAPPY UNION , outside a rival early on, was taken up sharply and carried out by CHALK HILL approaching the five
furlong marker, recovered into the turn, advanced inside from upper stretch to past mid stretch then failed to seriously sustain the final sixteenth. GOLD
TIME VIXEN was nudged to the front, dueled to the inside of a rival, shook clear while off the rail into the lane, could not withstand challenges near mid
stretch and weakened. HI HEELED WARRIOR chased off the rail, raced five wide between runners in upper stretch and weakened. SNEAKY CHEEKY
dueled outside GOLD TIME VIXEN, saw that one get away leaving the three eighths, pursued to the three sixteenths then tired. EVANGELINE ALLONS
stalked in the clear, edged up a bit between rivals into the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and weakened. CHALK HILL sustained an injury
heading to the five eighths pole, was pulled up then euthanized on the track. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning CHALK HILL. No action was taken.

Footnotes
EL DIVINO NINO broke alertly and quickly sprinted clear, set the pace along the inner rail and was under urging late. ENZO , sluggish to begin, circled rivals
four deep on the turn, rallied and drifted in near the eighth pole. WORK HARD raced in the three path between horses entering the turn, remained three
wide into the stretch and rallied mildly. VILALUZ bumped DESVIO when bearing in at the break, raced in the two path inside horses on the turn and
weakened in the drive. DESVIO , pinched back after getting bumped on both sides leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail in upper stretch, swung
out near the eighth pole and finished willingly. DATS MY PHARAOH bumped DESVIO when bearing out leaving the starting gate, chased the pace while in
the two path on the turn and gave way. BUDDY'S A CHARM hugged the inner rail when chasing the pace and gave way approaching the stretch.
TUBTIMSIAM , four wide on the turn, was done approaching the stretch.

FLAT OUT FLYING dropped in early and rated forwardly, edged up past the five eighths then was patiently handled tracking the leading pair heading to the
five sixteenths, eased out and was put to pressure soon after, found a seam to advance through entering the lane, forged to command approaching the
furlong grounds, kicked clear under left handed asks then was steadily hand ridden the final sixty yards. UNDER THE RADAR , off the pace while saving
ground, moved up near the half, saw the leaders get away some while hard ridden past the three eighths, stayed inside gathering momentum in upper
stretch, angled out with a furlong to go and finished up willingly to gain the place. MOSE PERFECT broke on top despite a bobble, cleared early and set the
pace towards the inner rail, was joined leaving the three eighths, dueled holding a slim lead into the lane, could not contain the winner past the three
sixteenths and faded late. FORTUNE'S FOOL stalked three wide outside a rival, moved up nearing the five sixteenths, chased four wide into the lane and
weakened. TREASURE TROVE dropped in early and settled, angled out leaving the far turn, circled four wide into the stretch and came up empty. FAST
BREAKIN CASH prompted the pace two wide, moved to engage the leader nearing the five sixteenths, sparred three wide into the lane and weakened.

IN THE DANCE , kept outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn three deep, was fanned four wide at the head of the lane, closed outside
horses and took the lead in deep stretch. CATALEYA STRIKE lacked speed, raced along the inner rail for six furlongs, moved to the three path at the head
of the stretch and rallied inside the winner. WHISKEYINTHEJARO stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the three path leaving the far turn
and failed to sustain the move. BIGDADDYSBOY set the pace along the inner rail and gave way late. PHOTO HOP , never a factor, raced along the inner

Footnotes
SUPER BOURBON gained a slim lead early on and took inside pressure from GUAPONESS, spurted clear leaving the far turn, responded when set down
towards the inside in upper stretch and widened, kept on under strong handling past the furlong grounds and lasted. BRUSHBACK eased back from
between foes leaving the far turn, came under a hustling ride soon after, saved ground advancing in upper stretch, angled out, split rivals three wide past the
sixteenth marker and finished gamely to gain. INFINITE SERIES , in range early while saving ground, angled out after three furlongs, circled four wide into
the stretch, moved up outside runners near the sixteenth pole and churned on. MOTIVO stalked the pace three wide, was pushed along past the five
sixteenths, gave hard chase between foes past the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. GUAPONESS vied inside the winner early on, couldn't quite
keep pace exiting the far turn, stayed on to pursue inside runners near the sixteenth pole and kept trying to the wire. TWIRLING EXPRESS , four deep into
the turn, remained well wide into the stretch, altered in but came up empty. COMMON PROSPERITY broke outward, corrected and stalked three wide
between rivals, failed to kick on mid turn and retreated. FIRE AND KNIVES , sluggish from the gate, lagged far back into the turn, saved ground past the five
sixteenths, angled out in upper stretch but failed to menace. FAST FORWARD saved ground and faded around the turn.

Footnotes
CARMELINA accelerated to the early lead, hugged the rail setting a pressured pace, responded when set down approaching the eighth pole and edged
away. CAP CLASSIQUE prompted the pace outside the winner, finished willingly but was second best. MUNNY GRAB saved ground around the turn,
remained along the rail through the stretch and finished evenly. ROANAN GODDESS , four deep under rating down the backstretch, circled the turn in the
three path and flattened out. KISSEDBYANANGEL broke in the air, raced in the two path between horses around the turn and in the stretch and failed to
rally. SHINE ON MOON was a brief factor between horses and gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
SWEET SODDY J sped to the front, set a rated pace towards the rail, was guided two wide entering the lane, responded to asking soon after and kicked
away from foes, continued to increase his advantage under stout rousing past mid stretch then cruised home the final fifty yards. GREAT OPPORTUNITY
stumbled at the break, recovered and pulled his way forward nearing the five eighths, tracked three to four wide while attempting to lug out, chased three
wide between runners into the lane and kept on with good energy to earn the place. COOL IN BLUE broke awkwardly, regrouped and angled in advancing
to the five furlong pole, chased two wide to the inside of runners past the quarter pole, stayed on pursuing past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly in the
final seventy yards. AMERICAN WAR HERO stumbled at the break, found himself well back after getting back on track, raced two wide under a ride into the
lane, angled out past mid stretch and churned on. DAVYJONZ , between foes chasing the early pace, angled in leaving the far turn, failed to kick on nearing
mid stretch and faded. CATAHOULA MOON lost ground five wide early, advanced four wide mid turn to loom, failed to go on leaving the three sixteenths
and gave way. DEPOSITION settled off the early pace, gained four wide mid turn, lacked a response entering the stretch and faded.

BURNINGUPTHEDOUGH , outrun for the early lead, chased the pace racing along the inner rail on the turn, moved to the two path at the head of the
stretch, swept to command approaching the eighth pole, was under urging in mid stretch and pulled away. GABRIEL SEVEN , rated behind horses mid way
down the backstretch, swung out leaving the turn, was fanned five deep turning for home and rallied mildly. MINNY SPEIGHTSTER lacked speed, was in
the two path between horses on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside foes. HUNDRED PROOF broke sluggishly, circled the
turn three wide, was four wide in upper stretch and drifted in near the eighth pole. A B C YA lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, got caught in traffic in
upper stretch and altered out to the five path in mid stretch. WYSOQUIET , three deep disputing the pace around the turn, faded in the drive. UNCLE
CHINITO hugged the inner rail disputing the pace around the turn, weakened the final furlong. MALIBU SLEW disputed the pace in the two path between
horses and weakened. VIBRANT FORCE raced near the inner rail on the turn and gave way.
