Footnotes
FACT OR FICTION chased briefly then cleared SIR LOOKING GLASS to take control, padded the lead off the rail through the turn, remained clear into the
final furlong and held well under a drive. MIDNIGHT LOVE bumped with inner rival at the start, chased three wide into the turn, moved out on the turn and
entered the lane six wide, drifted in while finishing willingly through the final furlong but could only whittle the gap on the winner. PUDDIN HEAD JONES
bumped at the start, raced near the inside on the back into the turn, came out and exited the bend five wide, offered a mild rally and gained the show. NED
bumped with outer rival in the beginning, got put in a bit tight chasing between rivals early, had to steady approaching the three-eighths pole, angled in
leaving the bend and could not rally. SIR LOOKING GLASS broke well then chased the leader up the backstretch, raced along the inside into the turn,
moved out and spun five wide into the stretch, then weakened down the lane. BLACKJACK AND BEER broke in and bumped, raced outside a rival into the
turn near the back, drifted out on the turn, moved inward midstretch to bother rival and failed to menace. T G I F ALPHA brushed leaving the gate then
dropped back, trailed four wide into the turn, got floated out midway around the bend, angled in some late on the bend and was not a factor.

TIFF WITH JIMMY quickly cleared, kicked away two, three, then four wide on the turn, asked left handed midstretch and continued to widen under steady
handling. YVETT'S SURPRISE chased three wide into the turn, entered the lane five wide, could not make any headway on the winner but was clearly
second best. STORMING GRAY chased five wide into the turn, got moved out to the six path briefly, steered in a bit to enter the lane four wide, lacked a
serious response but churned on for a clear third. TAKE CARAMIE broke a step slow, closest in pursuit along the rail into the turn, eased off the fence and
exited the bend four wide but weakened down the lane. FEVER broke well then dropped back to last, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor.
LIGHTS ASTERN chased between rivals well off the rail, went four then five wide on the turn before angling down to the two path leaving the bend and
came up empty. PER RULING ECM2024-003 FROM THE HIWU, FEVER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 5th TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
MY PARTNER GLEN climbed early while chasing three deep into the first turn, went five wide into the far turn, came six wide into the stretch, rallied from
the middle portion of the track, collared the leader at the sixteenth pole and drove past. TOKAMAK vied four deep into the first turn then chased four wide
into the backstretch, stalked two wide into the far turn, angled out and bid five wide into the stretch, kicked clear in upper stretch, headed at the sixteenth
pole and yielded late. AVIATOR NATION broke a step slow, traveled four then three deep on the first turn, went four wide into the second bend, moved in a
bit then angled five wide into the stretch, kept on through the lane and edged IVORY SKY for the show. IVORY SKY was off slow to begin, raced along the
inside at the back into the first turn, stayed inside to the second bend, eased off the rail and came three wide into the stretch, angled out in the lane,
summoned a mild rally but was outkicked for the show honors. VENOM bobbled leaving the gate, vied between into the first turn then took a stalking
position behind the top pair, traveled along the rail then two wide leaving the far turn and lacked a bid. NYQUILER vied three deep into the clubhouse turn
then dueled from outside, fought into the stretch and weakened. I GOT A GUY vied along the rail then dueled inside NYQUILER, roused around the far turn,
fought three wide into the stretch and also weakened. DIAMONDS PREFERRED raced between at the back into the first turn, traveled three wide into the
second bend, entered the lane five wide and failed to menace. REEF CITY tracked four in the four path, two to three wide on the second bend, came up
empty in the lane and was not persevered with in the furlong grounds. CHURCHMEISTER chased two to three wide on the first turn, angled over to the rail
on the second bend and tired.

Footnotes
MIKE OPERATOR sprinted clear early and showed the way in the two path around the first turn, led three wide into the lane, put to right handed urging in
upper stretch, felt SIGNOFTHECROSS gaining into the final furlong but responded well to hold that rival at bay. SIGNOFTHECROSS bumped inner rival at
the start, chased five wide into the first turn then angled to the three path, remained three wide to the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch, drew closer
from outside in the lane and loomed boldly at the eighth pole but lacked the needed late kick to get by the winner. PACO'S PICO bumped leaving the gate,
chased four wide outside a rival on the clubhouse turn, remained wide into the lane and could not summon the needed response in the final furlong.
EGOMANIA chased on the inside, got put in a bit tight near the three-eighths pole and dropped back to last, angled six wide into the lane and kept on for a
minor award. MY INDY chased in the two path, angled over to the rail on the far turn and lacked a rally. SOL DEL SUR closest in pursuit off the rail around
the first turn, rounded the far turn two to three wide and tired.

ISSA COURT stumbled leaving the gate, raced up close in the two path, moved up to press from outside at the four furlong mark, took over at the
three-eighths pole, drifted five wide leaving the far turn, responded when called upon with the right hand while continuing to drift out and held gamely to the
wire. CORNELIA FORT forwardly placed three deep on the first turn, bid outside the new leader on the second bend, got floated out by that rival six wide
leaving the far turn, hounded that rival from outside while also drifting out but could not summon the needed late kick to overtake the winner. TIZZY
TWISTER settled in the two path, rounded the far turn four wide, fought with WARRIOR LADY for the show honors and bested that rival for a minor award.
WARRIOR LADY stalked along the rail, moved out and went four wide into the second bend, came six wide into the lane and got outdueled for the show
honors. SWEET HELLO set the pace from inside, pressured at the half-mile pole, lost command with three furlongs remaining, chased the top pair past the
five-sixteenths pole, came out into the lane and gave way. HOT ROD MAMA dropped back early and tucked inside, saved ground to the stretch and failed to
menace.

RED CROSS KNIGHT showed the way in the two path early, pressure from outer pair into the backstretch, maintained a short lead around the far turn then
cleared approaching the stretch, felt some pressure from RODRIGOKNOWS at the top of the stretch but responded nicely when called upon and drew away
in the late stages. RODRIGOKNOWS chased keenly along the inside early, took aim three wide into the lane, loomed in upper stretch but was turned away
by the winner. BUCK OWENS chased four wide into the far turn, two then three wide on the second bend, churned on for the show honors but could not
threaten the top pair. DISCRETIONARY DAY chased two to three wide early, went two, three, then four wide on the second bend, angled out in the lane
and lacked a rally. STAR PROSPECT chased three then four wide early, stayed off the inside into the second bend, moved into the three path then steered
five wide into the lane and weakened. NOLONGERAHOBBY settled inside early then shifted to the two path to go between rivals on the first turn, tipped
three wide to go up and pressure the leader into the backstretch, kept the pressure on through the far turn, lost touch with the leader and chased four wide
approaching the stretch, then weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
NOTHING LIKE YOU vied for the lead inside a trio of rivals into the clubhouse turn then took control around the bend, cleared CHATALAS on the
backstretch, pressured by that rival into the far turn, shook free again around the bend, showed the way in the two path entering the lane, roused at the top
of the stretch, kicked away midstretch, asked once right handed in the final furlong and coasted in the final sixteenth. GREAT FORTY EIGHT bobbled a bit
at the start, hustled between rivals early, dropped back a bit to chase two wide then along the rail on the clubhouse turn, saved ground through the second
bend, shifted out ad bumped CHATALAS midstretch and kept on willingly for a clear second. FLYNN'S CHANCE hit the gate then settled outside a rival at
the back, inched closer on the backstretch, ridden along three wide into the lane, moved out further but flattened out while earning the show honors.
CHATALAS vied three deep then two wide on the first turn, stalked NOTHING LIKE YOU on the backstretch then pressed from outside past the half-mile
pole, failed to sustain the challenge on the far turn and chased three wide into the lane, got bumped and impeded by GREAT FORTY EIGHT midstretch and
weakened in deep stretch. PACIFIC ROSE traveled along the inside racing at the back early, stayed along the fence into the far turn, tipped out leaving that
bend and failed to menace. GRAZIA showed early speed four deep then moved into the three path chasing after the top pair on the first turn, navigated the
far turn four then three wide and tired. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED GREAT FORTY EIGHT FROM SECOND AND
PLACED HER FOURTH FOR SHIFTING OUT AND CAUSING INTERFERENCE TO CHATALAS IN MIDSTRETCH, COSTING THAT RIVAL A CHANCE
AT A BETTER PLACING.
