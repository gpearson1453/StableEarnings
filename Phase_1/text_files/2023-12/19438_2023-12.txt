Footnotes
O'BANION (IRE) stalked the solid early pace between runners, lost ground along the turn and chased two wide to the quarter marker, was steered four then
five wide into the stretch and made a mild gain at the furlong marker, responded to urging into the final sixteenth, overtook HAVAKASH READY and edged
away in deep stretch to prevail. HAVAKASH READY showed good early speed and set a fast pace into the turn, drew to a clear lead while carving out solid
fractions heading to the quarter pole, was set down in upper stretch and showed the way to the furloing marker, held foes at bay to the sixteenth-pole, was
overtaken by O'BANION in deep stretch and was outfinished for the win, while besting the rest. HE'S INIT TO WINIT tracked the solid pace from the inside,
lost ground along the turn and chased to the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and re-rallied at the furlong grounds, was outkicked
in the final sixteenth and just held for third. SMOKIN' GOOD TIME raced a bit in tight early on, saved ground into the turn and improved position at the
quarter marker, angled four wide into the stretch, was gaining in the final furlong and just missed for third. JAIME'S COMMITMENT chased the solid pace
from a two wide position and offered a mild late rally. AS LUCK HAPPENS close up early, chased the loose pacesetter to the quarter marker, ran in pursuit
to mid-stretch and gave way. GALLO DEL CIELO showed brief speed, lost position four wide on the turn, swung five wide for the drive and weakened.
HOLY SMOKES lacked early speed, chased from the rail along the turn and did not factor. UNCLE DUSAN chased the fast early pace from mid-pack, was
coaxed along three wide to the quarter marker, dropped back into the stretch and tired.

wide into the turn and tracked to the quarter marker, was roused three wide into the stretch and vied for the lead approaching the furlong grounds, battled

BROOKYS GAL forwardly placed away from the start, navigated a bit of early traffic and tracked the decent pace while between runners heading into the
turn, was well positioned while two wide approaching the quarter pole, waited for racing room in upper stretch and dove to the rail at the furlong marker,
rallied and overtook STREET TIGER at the sixteenth-marker, bested the runner-up in deep stretch and held in a drive to prevail in the final strides. STREET
TIGER away in good order, was prominent leaving the break and contested the solid early pace with PONDERGATING, set contested fractions into the turn
and was well handled while carving a moderate pace to the quarter pole, shook free into the stretch and was asked for more at the furlong marker, was
overtaken by BROOKYS GAL inside of the sixteenth-pole and was gamely bested in deep stretch, while holding well in the end for second. HOT AND
SPICY never far back, tracked the early pace from the inside, came in tight entering the turn and waited for racing room at the quarter marker, shifted to the
outside into upper stretch then angled five to six wide at the furlong marker, finished well in deep stretch and missed for second while holding safely in the
end for third. SHADOWED THOUGHTS close up in the early stages, tracked the decent pace three wide along the turn, tipped four wide for the drive and
battled to mid-stretch, fought into the final sixteenth and was outkicked in deep stretch. ETHAN'S GIRL off slowly and spotted the field to begin, rushed up
outside of rivals and improved position five wide at the quarter pole, maintained a five wide path into the stretch and gained ground to come within aim at the
furlong marker, needed more in the final sixteenth and gave way in deep stretch. PONDERGATING hustled away from the start, engaged with STREET
TIGER in the early going and dueled through solid fractions heading to the turn, pressed outside of STREET TIGER to the quarter pole, battled into the
stretch and chased STREET TIGER to mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened late. CHAMAVILLE chased outside of
runners to begin, improved position four wide at the quarter pole, swung to the six path into upper stretch and lost ground at the furlong marker, lacked a
response in deep stretch and finished evenly. PRINCESS K chased from the rear early on, raced a bit in tight heading into the turn, chased two wide to the
quarter marker and did not threaten in the stretch. BABY I'M A STAR chased the pace from the inside, saved ground into the stretch, was outrun to the
furlong pole and tired in the final stages. SEATTLE FOG chased the contentious early pace, lost position along the turn and did not factor.

Footnotes
AUSPICIOUS STYLE stalked the moderate pace set by BRONZE WARRIOR, was always traveling well, took command at the five-sixteenths pole still in
hand, was roused passing the three-sixteenths marker, opened up and drew away under intermittent urging. BUENISIMO was slow into stride despite the
best efforts of the rider, went three wide into the first turn then rated mid-pack until the far turn, launched a bid after passing the three furlong marker, swung
out five wide into the stretch and was between horses in a three-way battle for second and got a nose in front at the wire. ECOLOGIST was pushed from the
gate into the early mix then was being ridden down the backstretch run to keep up with the pace, went into a full drive from the three furlong pole and
responded with a good finish but was out-nodded for the place. GALLANT WARREN was allowed to settle into stride from the break, stayed along the rail
down the backstretch making steady forward progress to the far turn, was right behind the leading pair passing the five-sixteenths marker then had to wait
for room, got a fortunate inside run into the stretch, then was inside of a three horse battle down the stretch for the place and came up just short. DESERT
DUDE broke in and made light contact with WELLSWORT (IRE) then was hustled to get forward position going into the turn, then was content to sit behind
the leading pair to the far turn, got closer through that turn then was set down near the quarter pole, loomed a threat to mid-stretch then weakened in the
final furlong. ATTENZIONE unhurried early, settled near the rear of the field in the early going racing off the rail in the three to four path, tried to make a wide
rally through the far turn then came extremely wide into the stretch, kept to task but could only pass a couple of stragglers late. WELLSWORT (IRE) took a
light bump from DESERT DUDE after the break, lacked early speed and moved over to the rail when clear, held that position to the far turn, was roused
approaching the stretch but could do no better than chase to the wire. BRONZE WARRIOR was hustled and easily gained the early lead then was allowed
to set moderate fractions with AUSPICIOUS STYLE stalking to the outside but not pressing the issue, had no response when that rival took over the lead
passing the five-sixteenths marker, came under pressure before the quarter pole and hand nothing to offer down the stretch.

Footnotes
MELANIE'S TIGER unseated the rider in the post parade, was allowed to settle away from the start, guided outside of runners into the turn and raced five
wide to the quarter pole, maintained a wide path into upper stretch and loomed heading to the furlong marker, battled with UNBRIDLED VISION into the
final sixteenth, shook free of the game runner-up in deep stretch and edged away late to prove best. UNBRIDLED VISION hard sent leaving the break,
raced close up to the decent early pace and tracked from the outside heading to the turn, gained ground three wide at the quarter marker and vied for the
lead into upper stretch, battled with MELANIE'S TIGER inside of the furlong marker, was gamely bested in the final sixteenth and held well for second at the
finish. FREE AGAIN lost his path at the start and was away slowly, chased the decent early pace and was guided two wide into the turn, chased to the
quarter marker then angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied at the furlong pole, was outkicked in the final sixteenth but stayed on to be a clear third in the
end. EXPLOSIVELY took back to track the decent early pace, was well placed while saving ground heading into the turn, improved position heading to the
quarter marker then waited for racing room nearing the top of the stretch, remained in tight into upper stretch, found room at the furlong marker, lacked the
needed response in the final sixteenth and passed tiring rivals in deep stretch. DRIVE BY hustled leaving the break, engaged with POWERIZED and
disputed the pace with that rival into the turn, dueled outside of POWERIZED heading to the quarter pole, shook free and battled into upper stretch, was
outkicked at the furlong pole, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. LEADING THE PACE tracked the early pace from
the outside, chased four wide along the turn, came in tight and was shuffled back at the quarter pole, lost position and chased four wide into the stretch,
lacked a response in the final furlong and passed tiring rivals late. JERRY'S SPIRIT tracked the decent early pace while between runners, lost position three
wide at the quarter marker, ran evenly to the furlong pole and gave way in the final stages. POWERIZED showed early speed, engaged with DRIVE BY and
contested the decent pace with that rival heading into the turn, disputed the moderate pace from the inside approaching the quarter marker, lost position
approaching the furlong grounds and tired. LAST BABY prominent early, raced close up to the decent pace heading into the turn, chased two wide to the
quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and tired. ONE BOLD BID showed little.

Footnotes
MOTHER'S PRAYER broke well then settled mid-pack three wide through the first half mile, was let loose approaching the seven-sixteenths pole and
remained three to four wide through the far turn while making steady progress toward the leaders, went four wide into the stretch challenging for the lead,
was set down and made a determined run to win clear. UNION WAVE settled near the rear but saved ground early, moved closer through the far turn, came
into the stretch blocked behind a wall of horses, had to navigate from the two path out to the five path for clear run, surged when clear but was too late to
catch the winner. SHOT OF A LIFETIME went three wide through the first bend, was still in no particular hurry down the backstretch, circled the field through
the turn the tipped out six wide into the stretch and produced a strong finish. ROBIE got good position early and settled behind the pace, waited for racing
room on the rail through the far turn, came into the stretch still with nowhere to go, dove to the inside just before the eighth pole, responded to strong
handling but came up short of a minor award. COUSIN RICHIE broke a step slow then had to check off heels when ROBIE came over after the break, was
last early but saved ground through the first turn, remained in the rear heading into the far turn then took the inside path through the turn, came into the
stretch boxed in with a wall of horses in front, tried to get to the outside but ran out of time and space. PROOF HE RIDES was left alone on the lead through
the early stages, set reasonable fractions to the far turn, held sway into the stretch, battled with some determination to the furlong marker then gave way.
CHARBONNEAU raced close up just off the pace while in the three to four path, bid three wide at the top of the stretch then flattened out. STONE'S RIVER
got away well and was content to stalk the pace from a length or two behind, went to challenge for the lead passing the seven-sixteenths pole, got even at
the quarter pole and came into stretch between horses, battled to mid-stretch then gave way inside the final furlong. DESHAMBEAU was off slowly then
pulled the rider forward through the first turn, tracked mid-pack to the far turn, came under a ride after passing the five-sixteenths pole, quickly dropped to
last and was outrun from that point.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL HORNET asked for speed leaving the break and was prominent early on, stalked the decent pace into the turn and advanced two then three
wide approaching the quarter pole, was given his cue and vied for the lead into upper stretch, took command and drifted a bit at the furlong marker,
straightened and kicked clear nearing the sixteenth-marker, was kept to task into deep stretch and drew away to be much the best. MAJOR TOM forwardly
placed in the early going, tracked the decent pace between rivals then became rank and hard to place heading into the turn, checked out of tight quarters
and chased two wide along the bend, waited for racing room at the quarter marker then navigated traffic three wide into upper stretch, rallied at the furlong
marker, was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth and ran on in deep stretch to best the rest. GEORGE HERMAN RUTH broke out at the start,
traded bumps with RANCHO RED and was away slowly, allowed to settle, improved position three wide along the turn, swung six wide for the drive, rallied
inside of the furlong marker and was up for third in the final strides. GORM away in good order, took back off of the early pace and settled in the opening
furlong, chased outside of rivals along the turn and improved position three then four wide at the quarter pole, swung to the five path into the stretch and
continued his rally at the furlong marker, needed more in the final sixteenth, was outkicked in deep stretch and just missed for third. JERSEY BABE took
back to track the decent early pace, was not far back while tracking from the outside heading into the turn, chased four wide along the bend and gained
ground at the quarter marker, continued his advance into the lane and vied for the lead in upper stretch, steadied off of heels at the furlong marker, could not
keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. RANCHO RED traded bumps with GEORGE HERMAN RUTH at the start and was off a bit
slowly, chased the early pace from the second flight and raced between rivals into the turn, improved position along the bend while two wide then waited for
racing room while boxed in at the quarter pole, dove to the rail into upper stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and gave way. DR. FLASH DANCER
hustled to the front leaving the break, controlled the pace while carving out decent fractions into the turn, set the pace off of the rail while showing the way to
the quarter marker, came under pressure into upper stretch, could not keep pace at the furlong grounds and faded in the final stages. DANZ TILL TEN
chased the early pace from the inside, was well placed heading into the turn, improved position approaching the quarter marker then became hard to place
while in a bit tight nearing the top of the lane, lost ground into the stretch and did not offer a late response. RIVER'S BEHEST chased from the inside,
gained ground into the stretch, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and did not threaten. STAY LIT lacked early speed, chased two wide to the
quarter marker and did not factor. ZHIVAGO forwardly placed in the early going, chased the decent early pace between runners, lost ground three wide
along the turn, lacked a response into the stretch and tired in the drive. MEDAL ICE chased the decent early pace from the second flight and outside of
rivals, lost position five wide along the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
AMERICAN EMPIRE forwardly placed in the early running, tracked the moderate pace two wide into the backstretch run, was well placed approaching the
half-mile marker, raced two wide into the far turn, waited a bit for racing room nearing the top of the lane and tipped three wide for the stretch drive, rallied to
come within aim at mid-stretch, vied for the lead inside of the furlong pole and took command heading to the sixteenth-marker, determinedly dug in in deep
stretch and held in a drive to prevail. BID ON THE PRIZE settled three wide into the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run, was steered four
wide into the second turn and was roused five wide into the stretch, continued to gain ground at the furlong marker, closed willingly into the final sixteenth
while widest, could not reel in the winner in the final strides and won the nod for second on the wire. NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) lunged at the start then
was crowded leaving the break and was away slowly, steadied in tight quarters entering the first turn and was allowed to settle while saving ground into the
backstretch run, was coaxed along three wide into the far turn, encountered traffic at the quarter pole, angled five wide nearing mid-stretch, finished well in
the final sixteenth and just missed for second on the wire, while holding safely for third. NO SECRET prominent leaving the break, contested the moderate
pace with HARBOR OUTLAW into the backstretch run, disputed the pace outside of that rival into the far turn, battled with HARBOR OUTLAW into the
stretch, was overtaken by AMERICAN EMPIRE inside of the furlong marker, fought back to the sixteenth-pole, could not hold off oncoming rivals in deep
stretch and was outfinished. INCREDIBLE SHOT never far back in the early going, saved ground while tracking the moderate pace, gained ground into the
stretch, could not find racing room into the final sixteenth and was outkicked in deep stretch. O B'S broke well, avoided any of the trouble in the first turn,
pulled into tracking position three wide behind the trio on the lead, launched a bid with three furlongs to run, came out to the four path for the stretch run, ran
on well but was outfinished in the final yards. HARBOR OUTLAW came away well from the break and was first to the turn, alternated the lead with NO
SECRET through moderate fractions down the backstretch, responded when challenged on the turn, came into the stretch with a slight lead, battled hard
past mid-stretch but weakened in the final furlong. CAPIAT hesitated at the start, was slow to begin and fell way behind, chased the field to the far turn,
swung wide for the drive and did not make an impact. J D'S RUDE BOY settled while not far back, maintained a two wide path to the quarter marker and
lacked a response in the stretch. CONFUCIUS broke well and was prompted to enjoin the early pace, nearly ran up heels going to the first turn the swung
out three wide, moved forward through the turn then was pressing the pace down the backstretch, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, loomed
threat at the quarter pole then tired and was outrun down the stretch.

Footnotes
CHANCERY WAY away in good order, was asked for speed leaving the break and assumed command in the early going, carved out a solid pace while
pressed into the turn, dictated terms while pressured to the quarter pole, shook free into upper stretch and kicked to a clear lead heading to the furlong
marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and held safely in the end over the oncoming runner-up. SCARY FAST RIDE tracked the solid early pace
from a two wide position, tracked between runners into the turn and made a mild gain at the quarter marker, shifted three wide into the stretch and chased
CHANCERY WAY to the furlong grounds, closed well into the final sixteenth, was able to put mild pressure on the winner in deep stretch but could not reel
that one in and was second best. ALL DIALED IN took back off of the quick early pace, tracked from the outside heading into the turn and chased two then
three wide approaching the quarter marker, swung six wide into the stretch and chased to the furlong pole, closed willingly while widest in the final furlong,
was not able to impact the top pair in deep stretch and outfinished TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL in the final strides to secure third. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL rated
nicely off of the solid early pace, was not far back approaching the turn and chased two wide to the quarter marker, angled to the five path into upper stretch
and chased to the furlong marker, was gaining in the final sixteenth and just missed for third at the wire. TAMARA MINE broke alertly, pressed the solid
early pace outside of CHANCERY WAY, kept pressure on the pacesetter through quick fractions approaching the quarter pole, was repelled into the stretch
and chased to the furlong grounds, lacked a response into deep stretch and gave way. BLUE WILDCAT chased the fast early pace from the outside, inched
closer three wide at the quarter marker, tipped four wide for the drive, lost ground at the furlong marker and tired in the final stages. BABY KRISTEN
bobbled at the start and was off slowly, rushed up in the opening furlong and raced close up to the solid early pace, lost ground while in pursuit heading to
the quarter pole, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
ROISTER broke sharply but veered in and made light contact with MY SUNSHINE, seized the early lead, took the field through comfortable fractions while
keep all at bay to the stretch, quickened when set down passing the three-sixteenth pole, drew away and won geared down near the wire. BEROLIJEAN
(FR) broke a step slow then was rushed up into contention, floated six wide into the clubhouse turn, pulled the rider up close to the early leaders down the
backstretch, made an eye-catching move four wide through the far turn, was outkicked in the final furlong and held well in the end for second. WILL IS
CHILL checked hard off heels going into the first turn and was forced out to the five or six path, made slow but steady progress from the rear of the field to
get into contention, bid in earnest from the three furlong pole, came into the stretch six wide and produced a grinding finish that was good enough to gain
the show. WALKING BOSS was content to save ground near the rear of the field, mounted a rally into traffic on the far turn, then swung seven wide into the
stretch and closed willingly but was to late to crack the top three. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR was keen to get into the early mix and was caught four wide
around the first turn, pulled to a position just behind the trio contesting the early pace, was content to hold that position down the backstretch, became boxed
in through the far turn, then ran on evenly when clear in the late stages. POUR ON THE COLE checked hard going into the first turn, was content to keep
the inside path through the early stages, started to make a run then had to check slightly near the three furlong pole, idled behind a wall of horses to the
stretch, had clear run passing the three-sixteenths pole but was unable to tae advantage and tired. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) lumbered away from the gate
well behind the field, then got over to the rail before the first bend, settled in the rear for the first half mile, tried to make an eight wide run into the stretch but
was unable to make an impact. AWESOME DUDE settled mid-pack while racing two deep early, pulled close to the leaders down the backstretch, checked
in traffic twice in the far turn, got clear in the stretch but was unable to make an impact. MY SUNSHINE brushed with ROISTER at the break then while
trying to contest the early pace put POUR ON THE COLE in tight going into the first turn, switched out a path and stalked the pacesetting ROISTER from
two deep, remained prominent to the far turn, then came under pressure near the five-sixteenths marker and weakened. BROOKYS TAPIT got away well
then pressed the pace three wide under a firm hold, remained close through the far turn then began to struggle to keep up passing the five-sixteenth pole
and came up empty in the stretch.
