Footnotes
ILIMITADA stalked the pace from four wide down the backstretch then moved up from three wide at the three furlong marker, tipping out to four wide in
upper stretch for a late run at the leader and prevailed. BEAT THE DOUBLE went to an early pressured lead around to the first turn then took a clear lead
while setting the pace through the final turn but was wore down the deep stretch but proved second best. CHARMING KAT tracked the leaders down the
backstretch then moved between horses at the quarter pole, angled back inside to make a run on the inside into the stretch for a late rally. GRACE'S
VISION raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made an inside bid on the final turn but was outfinished in the stretch. SLIM CAUSEWAY
was allowed to settled around the first turn then trailed the field to the final turn but made a strong inside run to finish strong. PENNIE'S MAGIC trailed the
field early while saving ground down the backstretch, made a mild bid on the final turn but finished evenly. SENSE OF HEART pressed the pace from the
two path around the first turn then settled off the pace to the three furlong marker and retreated. BLUERIDGEBALLERINA raced off the pace from off the rail
to the three furlong marker and faded.

Footnotes
OURPERFECTPRINCE shared the command from the two path to deep stretch then edged away late. SPARKIN shared the command from the inside to
deep stretch but couldn't continue to fend of the challenge late but was clearly second best. GONE SOLUTION chased the leaders throughout from off the
rail but was no match for the top two. CLEVER PRINCE settled off the pace on the inside and didn't make a bid but was best of others. CARLOS'S MAMA
trailed the field to the stretch and show a mild late run to pass tiring rivals. MULETRAIN was off a step slow leaving the gate, then was unhurried in the
middle of the pack while racing evenly. PETEY hopped leaving the gate and had to be steadied early, settled in the middle the pack through the final turn
but dropped back and was never a threat.

Footnotes
CHARLIE'S PARADE sprinted to press the pace from the inside then took the lead at the three furlong marker and fended off the late outside challenge to
hold on for the win. ROCK SOLID WORDS raced off the pace on the inside then angled out to three wide going into the stretch for a late run at the leader
but was too late. MYMANROWEN chased the leaders through the turn then moved out to five wide in upper stretch and rallied to be up for the third place
money. K R POWER STORM showed good early speed to the three furlong marker then vied for the lead to mid stretch and tired. CATALINA DAY vied for
the lead from three wide to the quarter pole and weakened. RUN CARLOS raced on the inside on the backstretch then moved up on the turn but failed to
sustain the bid. ALL COUNTRY tracked the leaders from three or four wide around the turn then moved out to mid track in the stretch to improve his
position. EL IT raced two wide and made a milde bid on the turn but was empty for the drive. DIXIE'S ASTRO trailed the field and remained back. BELLAMY
BROTHER was always back.

INDIMAAJ pressed the pace from between horses around the first turn then took the lead at the half mile marker and matched strides with CUSTOM BLUE
GRASS to the three furlong marker then edged away to draw clear in the stretch. HOT LE ROY vied for the lead from three wide to the three furlong marker
then pressed the pace from two wide but couldn't catch INDIMAAJ while fighting gamely. HUNTERS GHOST stalked the pace from four wide down the
backstretch then made a bid on the final turn but was no match for the top two. CHAOSMOS raced off the pace on the inside to the three furlong marker
then fell back on the final turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. DISCREET INVASION trailed the field to the top of the stretch but had no impact.
CUSTOM BLUE GRASS sprinted to a brief lead around the first turn then match strides with INDIMAAJ to the three furlong marker and tired.

LIL MISS DE BUY showed no early speed then made a rail bid on the turn and kept on for the late rally and was up in the final jumps. LOTS OF GOLD vied
for the lead from the inside then took over at the three furlong marker and pulled away but was caught in the final jumps. BIND ON EARTH chased the
leaders from the inside on the turn, moved out to three wide in upper stretch for a late run to be up for third place money. STARBUCK LUCK showed the
early speed then pressed the pace from the two path to mid turn and gave way. DONNAS FINAL WORD trailed the field early then made a three wide bid
on the turn avoiding the rival that was pulling up and failed to menace. FREEZER BURN was forwardly placed to the three furlong marker and retreated.
SWEET CONFUSION was rushed to contention, appeared to take a bad step near the quarter pole and was pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
GETCHA pressed the pace from the inside to the final turn then fell back on the turn but came again in a determined stretch drive to prevail. MIAS
MOONBEAM stalked the pace from off the rail around the first turn then moved up from three wide on the backstretch, engaged the leader going into the
final turn and match strides on the outside of G VICTORY around the final turn and took the lead at the three sixteenths pole, edged away but was denied in
the final yards. SPHEROID was forwardly placed off the leaders down the backstretch then started a bid at the three furlong marker but was no match for
the top two but was best of the rest. U S NAVY CROSS was allowed to settle off the rail through the final turn then made a four wide late run in the stretch to
improve position. DEALIN' STELEN was unhurried while saving ground and passed tired ones in the stretch. G VICTORY was bumped by TAPALIST
leaving the gates, then rushed up to a challenged lead from the two path, edged away past the three furlong marker but had to match strides from the inside
of MIAS MOONBEAM to the top of the stretch and gave way. TAPALIST broke outward and bumped with G VICTORY leaving the gate, settled in the middle
of the pack but was not a factor.

Footnotes
JOE T tracked the leaders from three wide around the first turn then made a three wide bid on the final turn to engage the leader at the three sixteenths
pole, battled down the stretch to the final sixteenth and drew clear. POUND OUT A DEAL broke sharp and pressed the pace around the first turn, moved up
to match strides on the outside of SMOKEY G down the backstretch then edged away into the final turn but was headed by JOE T at the three sixteenths
pole and gave way grudgingly. CHAOTIC JACK raced off the pace on the inside to the quarter pole then moved out to tow wide to move around tiring rival
but kept on and held on for third place money. FRENETIC DAY saved ground while settling in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then made a
three or four wide bid at the quarter pole for a late rally and just missed the show. AUTUMN ROB was forwardly placed in the two path down the
backstretch, tipped out to three or four wide going into upper stretch but lacked the late response and finished evenly. DADSAMUMBLER was allowed to
settle near the back, made a rail bid on the final turn to pass tiring rivals. SMOKEY G sprinted to a clear early lead around the first turn then matched strides
inside of POUND OUT A DEAL down the backstretch and gave way on the final turn. FRUIT CUP was unhurried and remained back. MIGHTY MADDOX
stalked the pace from four wide down the backstretch and stopped.
