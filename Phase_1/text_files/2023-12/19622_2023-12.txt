Footnotes
TANYA SHOWERS broke back, steered out four wide when advancing into the stretch, challenged on the outside past the furlong marker, finished with
energy to be clear at the wire. LEMON MUFFIN also broke back, dropped inside midway on the turn, moved out a bit to challenge outside the tiring leader
nearing the furlong grounds, lodged a bid inside the winner but could not match that one late while remaining clear for the place. BLUE SQUALL settled
outside early, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, staged a mild rally to annex the show. BOLD APPEAL broke sharp, soon sprinted clear, set the
pace toward the inside, continued to show the way through the turn, shortened stride inside the furlong marker to lose several positions. FOXY ZORRA
chased the leader in heading up the second flight, weakened. HAPPY N SMILING went one paced toward the inside. BROWNIE BAY in the second flight
early, began a steady fade before a half. LADY DRILLER fell back into the turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
HUSH IT HONEY moved up to press the early leader from the outside, dueled into the turn, took over late end the bend, kicked steadily clear under
pressure. HITTIN MY STRIDE in the second flight early, came four wide out of the turn, finished up willingly to be clearly second best. OUR KEEPSAKE
lacked early foot off the inside, raced three wide through the turn, staged a belated rally to capture the show. READY FOR TROUBLE broke back, four down
to three wide middle move into contention turn, flattened out a bit in the final furlong to be overhauled for the show. TORTUGA ISLAND in the second flight
off rail, fell back a bit late in the turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a serious late bid. SUBWAY SUSIE turned in an evenly paced effort inside.
HAYEK broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch just off the rail, dueled early turn, began to weaken when headed soon after. DANCING NANCY
remained always back. RISKY SPIRIT last away was always outrun. JANUARY JUBILEE backed up while racing in the two path.

MISS JEOPARDY in the main body outside, four wide bid turning for home, shook clear nearing ,the furlong marker, enough left to hold the runner up safe
late. SPIRITUAL LADY within striking distance early, checked up repeatedly in traffic early to mid turn, swung out five wide for the drive, finished up willingly
to be getting to the winner late. BENT HALO in the second flight early off the inside, moved closer in the two path turn, chased the winner past the furlong
grounds then weakened a bit, held the show. PLEASINGLY pressed the issue early, dueled late in the turn, faltered in the drive. IDALOU void of speed,
began to advance turn, carried out six wide into the lane by the runner up, continued to improve position. PALACE DRIVE in mid pack off the rail, lodged a
mild advance three wide in the turn, flattened out a bit in the drive. BOOGIE ON off a step slow, raced back, angled four wide into the lane, improved
position with some mild late interest. RED VOLTA in mid pack just off the inside, steadied in traffic midway on the turn, moved out slightly into the two path
and went evenly through the stretch. AMOUREUX off a step slow, back, little impact. GI GIS MAP off the pace, steadied midway on the turn, moved out four
wide, failed to rally. CREDITOR away in good order, pressed the issue up front while three wide for a half and gave way. EYE SHADOW broke sharp, with
the pace, checked up sharply in tight along the inside early turn, backed up.

Footnotes
STHENIC in the second flight off rail, between horses in the turn when moving a bit closer, came three wide for the drive, roused, kicked down the leader
under firm handling. NO COINCIDENCES with the pace just off the inside, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, clear past the furlong marker, could
not contain the winner, far clear of the others. LINNIE MAE forwardly placed early, dueled outside the runner up through the turn, gradually weakened,
saved the show. TEXAS SEQUOIA void of early foot off the rail, came four wide and between horses for the drive, improved position, gaining for the show
spot. LADY WOOPIG off a step slow, trailed well back for a half, steered out widest for the drive, also improved position with belated interest.
SUNNYANDSEVENTY void of speed, 3w into the lane, also improved position without posing a serious threat. PRINCIPAL ANITA broke back, lacked
speed, floated out five wide into the stretch, went evenly through the final furlong. KANTIRUN in mid pack and three wide, tired through the stretch. MO
HOPEFUL set or forced the early pace along the inside, gave way in the turn. BREAKFASTRUN lacked a rally. COSMIC CHIC in the second flight outside,
three wide turn, tired. EXHI LIL DARLIN in mid pack early, stopped late in the turn, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL GUN behind the pace while saving some ground first turn, crept up and lodged a rail bid before a half, showed the way through the final turn,
stayed clear through the lane while being kept to pressure. LINEBACKER off a step slow, raced back early as a result, steered out for the drive when
advancing out of the final turn, finished willingly to be well clear of the others, not a serious threat to the winner. BOX OFFICE in traffic and between horses
first turn, continued back, followed the runner up through into the stretch, rallied to be in time for the show, no match for the top two. GOTTA HAVE
DREAMS settled off the pace along the inside, continued inside backstretch, moved closer then was blocked along the rail far turn, clear into the lane, went
evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. DAILY GRIND raced in mid pack and four wide through the first turn, continued outside, ranged up to
become a threat five to four wide second turn, failed to sustain that advance through the stretch. TELL 'EM I'M COMIN void of speed, came four wide out of
the final turn, improved slightly while not a serious threat. MOHAWK RIVER broke alertly, set the early pace along the inside, fell back before a half, bit
closer late in the second turn then flattened out. GOLD SEARCH failed to menace while racing off the inside. WILL TAKE IT raced three wide, failed to rally.
J J'S RANGER four wide in the first turn, raced back, five wide into the stretch, lacked a closing kick. TOP OF THE STREET forwardly placed in the early
going, began a steady retreat after a half. FAMOUS FINAL SCENE pressed the issue for three quarters, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
TIME FOR TRUTH broke well, narrowly set the pace in the two path, dueled into the stretch, edged away when straightened for home, held the runner up
safely at bay the final furlong under steady handling. MR FILLIP broke sharp, pressed the winner from the outside for a half, fell back off that one in upper
stretch, could not get back to that same foe to the wire, clearly second best. ROCKETEIGHTYEIGHT raced back off the pace and the inside, raced five wide
out of the turn, rallied to be clear of the others, no threat to the top two. FIRST BID off a step slow, came three wide out of the turn when still well back,
improved position some belated interest through some traffic. CHUN MONEY settled off the pace in the two path, failed to response when called on for the
drive. NULLIFY broke out, void of speed, three wide through the turn, improved in the drive without posing a serious threat. SHATTUCK settled in mid pack,
three wide exiting the turn, lacked a closing response. GUARANI failed to make an impact while racing toward the inside. GO CAPTAIN off a bit slowly,
moved up quickly while rank in the run up the backstretch, challenged fur wide through the turn then gave way in the drive. IRISH RANSOM was finished
after a half. EL ENCANTO flashed brief speed along the inside, began to back up before a half. WRECK IT off slow, trailed well back throughout.

under steady handling. LIGHTLINE lacked speed off the inside, made a good advance five wide through the final turn, set down, kicked down ANDY'S

caught late for the place. NORTHERN FLAME stumbled at the start, raced back and outside, came four to five wide out of the final turn, improved position
with some late interest. MIKEALICIOUS went one paced while racing off the inside. MARKET STREET lacked speed while four wide in the first turn,
remained back, two path, bobbled second turn, improved a bit in the drive without proving to be a serious threat. WILLY D'S in mid pack while racing out in
the strip, four wide through the final turn, lacked a rally. GEWURZTRAMINER made little impact while racing three wide. GABARRA forwardly placed along
the inside, gave way in the drive. PAPPY'S REVENGE settled off the pace, backed up through the stretch. HOLUS BOLUS four wide through the first turn

Footnotes
ICE COLD unhurried in the early going, moved out, four wide first turn, continued outside, remained in the four path second turn, roused entering the
stretch, collared leader inside the furlong grounds, best. DENIM AND PEARLS away in good order, prompted the pace from the three path, moved to
challenge midway on the final turn, took over into the stretch, clear a furlong out, could not contain the winner, well clear for the place. NEOM BEACH
pressed the leader from the two path, challenged between foes and inside the runner up second turn, proved no match for that one or the winner in the
stretch, clear for the show. ASTERNIA took command soon after the start, set the pace inside, asked along when confronted in the second turn, weakened.
TAPIT JENALLIE went one paced through in the two to three path, lacked closing kick. FLOATING BEAUTY forwardly placed for a half inside, had little left.
PULA fell back to trail and was never involved.

Footnotes
PUN INTENDED took command soon after the start, set the pace in the two path, came in a bit to save some ground into the stretch, lugged in a bit when
straightened for home, stayed on to draw away late. AMY Z broke on top, settled off the winner while saving ground, moved out a bit for the drive, brush
midstretch, could do little with the winner late, held sway for the place. HAPPY TALK moved up after breaking toward back, within striking distance, in some
traffic into the stretch, brush past the furlong marker, outkicked for the place. LITTLE JAMIE settled behind the pace along the inside, improved a bit into the
lane, not a real threat. EXTREMELY GRUNTLED raced in mid pack outside, four wide first turn, four to five wide second turn, lacked a closing response.
AVA'S LOOK one paced off the inside. IN JUST MY HEELS forwardly placed four wide first turn, continued outside, four wide again through the second
turn, lacked a closing punch. ENIGMATIC five wide into the first turn, three wide through the second bend, tired. LILMS CONSTITUTION forwardly placed
three wide through the first turn, dueled through the second turn, gave way in the drive. LOST LOVE remained always back. BABE IN THE WOODS lagged
well back, four wide into the lane, remained back to be always outrun. GIRL COLLECTED was finished after a half.
