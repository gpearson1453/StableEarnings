Footnotes
RECONCILE bobbled at the start but broke in front, showed speed inside of a rival then set the pace under pressure, vied in the two path on the turn, shook
clear while put to a drive inside the three-sixteenths, came out some in the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. BOURBON SERENGETI
showed speed then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, remained on her inside lead until inside the three-sixteenths then
switched to the proper lead, pursued the winner in the final furlong, kept on willingly to the finish and earned the place. DOROTHY'S DREAMS was urged
along off the pace, dropped back while saving ground on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and improved with late energy for the show. SARIR
brushed with a rival while off a step slow, settled off the pace, moved up between foes late on the backstretch, chased in the two path on the turn, was
driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SABRINA chased the pace on the outside, dropped back three wide on the turn, spun five
wide into the stretch then dropped in and failed to rally.

Footnotes
MOSIENKO was well rated under a snug hold on the inside, eased off the inside leaving the five sixteenths and coaxed along, then came four wide off the
turn and made a bid when asked and drew away in the furlong grounds to prove best. QUICK MUNNY set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear on
the turn and remained clear to the furlong marker but could not go with the winner late while staying on to be clearly second best. SECRET LOVE chased
the early pace three wide, four wide on the turn and came five wide off the turn and lacked the needed winning rally while being along for the show award.
DISCO EBO was off last, then went up to press the early pace two wide, fell back on the turn, came three wide off the turn and weakened. RACHEL'S
ROCK prompted the early pace three wide and weakened on the turn, then was empty on the inside in the stretch.

Footnotes
FACE ABARRIO brushed with a rival at the start, went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, dictated terms in the two path on the turn,
responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. YOUBETTERBEJOKING broke out then was hustled, chased the
pace, saved ground on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch and earned the place while no match for the winner. GUN MAESTRO dropped off the
pace while racing with his head held high, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and
earned the show. HAPPY BOB was forwardly placed on the outside, chased four then three wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final
furlong and tired. FLASH KISS was forced out at the start, chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response.
SCOTTO bumped with a rival at the start and was taken up , spotted the front several lengths, was ridden along at the rear, went four then three wide on the
turn and was no factor. FLASHY ALEX brushed with a foe at the start then was hustled, chased the pace, moved from three to five wide early on the turn,
spun six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. BUILT TO LAST bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, dropped back near the
nine-sixteenths, moved from four to six wide early on the turn, floated nine wide into the stretch and faltered then was not urged while the rider remained
relatively down in the saddle.

FANCY AZTECA dueled for the lead three wide, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole to shake clear, then was kept to left handed crop to remain
clear to the wire. HARLAN'S BOND chased the early pace and was three wide on turn, came six wide off the turn and rallied well. CURLINS CHOIR was
settled early, two wide on the turn, three wide off the turn and had a mild late gain to get the show award. WILL BE FAMOUS was well placed early behind
the dueling leaders, moved out and was four wide by the quarter pole, five wide off the turn and had no kick in the drive, lost show spot late. DIVINE CROSS
stumbled badly at the start causing the rider to lose his balance, trailed and saved ground on the turn but had no significant rally. WARSAICHI dueled for the
lead on the inside and weakened in the drive. DUE TO A GATE MALFUNCTION, WERE FORCED TO GO TO A BACK UP GATE CAUSING A FIFTEEN
MINUTE DELAY INTO THE RUNNING OF THIS RACE.

LANDED bobbled a bit at the start, contested the pace between foes, vied in the two to three path on the turn, responded well when asked for her best in
upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. CALLING AN AUDIBLE bobbled slightly at the start then dropped back, moved up with five furlongs to run,
was placed under stout restraint while pulling hard on the bit late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path late on that bend,
spun three wide into the stretch and safely secured the place. FIVE TO TWO contested the pace on the inside of two foes, vied along the rail under urging
on the turn and tired while clear for the show. CALL HER BLUFF was hustled from the gate then urged along just off the pace, went three wide on the turn,
came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. TROUBLED LUCK raced just off the pace, chased between foes in the two path on the turn
and capitulated. COLLECT THE DATA bumped with a rival at the start, contested the pace on the outside, chased three to four wide on the turn and had
nothing left. BROOKLYN DANTZ broke in and bumped with a rival, tracked the pace on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, was urged three then
four wide on the turn and failed to respond. STARSINTHECITY broke a bit awkwardly, settled on the outside, chased four to five wide on the turn and
faltered then was not urged in the final furlong with the rider remaining relatively down in the saddle.

Footnotes
STRIKING SPEED angled in leaving the five eighths marker to the rail and rated behind the vying leaders, moved off the inside to make a three wide bid by
the quarter pole, then was sent down leaving the turn and drew clear in the final sixteenth to prove best under strong handling. HIGH HEAT set a pressured
pace inside a trio of rivals to the three eighths marker while in the two path, shook clear nearing the quarter pole and dug in gamely when confronted by the
winner leaving the three sixteenths, fought with that rival to the sixteenth marker but could not match strides late while being clearly second best.
HE'SGOTTASHORTFUSE prompted the pace on the outside, five wide on the turn and then weakened in the drive, stayed on to best the rest. GANDY
DANCING pressed the pace between rivals and was four wide on the turn but came up empty leaving the turn. MACH ONE pressed the pace three wide to
the three eighths and fell back at the five sixteenths, then shifted out and was five wide by the quarter pole and came up empty.

BROWN DON'T STOP was rated while moving from the two path to the four path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up three wide on
the far turn, took the advantage at the quarter-pole, fought outside of the runner-up while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch and edged clear late
under steady urging. VIN SANTO went to the front, dropped from the four path to the two path on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, was
asked while inside on the far turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole, fought on with the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished while just able to get
the place. DIXIE PHARAOH dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, went two then three wide on the far turn,
was roused near the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the place. INONIT was restless in the gate, steadied in
tight quarters along the rail early on the first turn, saved ground while settling off the pace, was urged along on the far turn and lacked the needed kick.
MALIBU MARGARITA was taken under a snug hold early, went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far
turn and came up empty. MANNY PENNY broke in at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear on the outside, moved closer late on the

Footnotes
MAKER'S CANDY set a pressured pace from the inside, cut the corner off the turn and was roused right handed by the furlong marker, then switched to left
handed crop urging to hold on gamely under a stiff drive. DRAKE'S PASSAGE prompted the early pace three wide, then pressed the winner two wide on the
turn, ridden along to maintain contact nearing the quarter pole, then was sent down for a long drive and finished well to just miss. ROCCO STRONG was
well placed early two wide, then shifted out leaving the five and a half furlong marker, chased the front two three wide on the turn, came four wide off the
turn and lacked a stretch bid, stayed on for the show award. HOLD THE SALSA was reserved early on the inside, two wide on the turn, came three wide
into the lane and passed the tiring rivals. LUNI SIMA was settled early two wide, then was four wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. GHOSTLYPRINCE
was settled early on the inside, saved ground on the turn and had no rally. DADDY KNOWS was settled on the outside early, four to five wide on the turn
and tired. SUNDAESWITHSANDY was off very slowly and walked out of the gate spotting the field about seven lengths, then never factored.
