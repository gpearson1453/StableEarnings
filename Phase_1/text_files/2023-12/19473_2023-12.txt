Footnotes
CATES SWOOSH pressed the pace dueling abreast foe down the lane putting away rival drawing out late. KREWE CHIEF tracked to upper stretch rallying
late to salvage place. MONOLITO pressed a narrow lead through the turn dueling from the rail down the lane weakening late. OWN THE TOWN raced
evenly lacking more. HOLIDAY BONUS played no factor. YEUDIEL was never involved. AREYOUTALKINGTOME was always outrun. AWESOME OX
bucked being steadied at the break. K'S LITTLE BILL chased through the turn wearing out in upper stretch. PER RULING #48 FROM THE WEST VIRGINIA
RACING COMMISSION, CATES SWOOSH WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
