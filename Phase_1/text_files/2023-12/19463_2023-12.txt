KODAPENDENT stalked close up two wide, pressed the pace on the backside, bid two wide entering the far turn, took over, drew off and was kept to the
task. SOPHOS was fractious in the gate, raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far turn, waited for room at the quarter pole, steadied on the rail
enterng the stretch, then angled out and rallied for second. WIZARD SERRAT set the pace on the inside, was pushed along on the backside, duled with the
winner on the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. CAUSALISTIC raced off the rail, off the pace, went three wide on the far turn and lacked a rally.
MOLIERE raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and did not factor. ARTISTIC REASON raced off the pace
inside, then two wide on the backside and failed to respond.

MASROUR pursued the loose pacesetter, took over at the quarter pole then pulled away under steady handling. GOLDEN CANDY roughed at the start,
advanced in the two path and closed gamely. GENGHIS trailed far behind, chased wide and finished with good energy. PYLON saved ground off the pace
and raced evenly in the stretch. AGGRANDIZE bumped at the start, raced off the leaders and faltered. NEIGH DUDE dropped back early and was never in
contention. AKEMI quickly sprinted clear, was collared midway on the turn and gave way.
