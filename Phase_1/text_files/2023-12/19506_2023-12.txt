Footnotes
STRAT MO MATIC stalked the early pace from the outside, made a three wide bid to take over while in hand, then was clear by the quarter pole and came
two wide into the lane, then held off the challenge from HAVE YOU HEARD in the furlong grounds to prove best gamely. HAVE YOU HEARD was rated
along the inside, boxed on the turn and had to steady nearing the quarter pole, shifted out and split rivals off the turn, then finished well but could not get to
the winner to just miss. RIDGEWOOD RUNNER stalked the early pace two wide, swung out four wide leaving the turn but lacked the needed winning bid,
held show award. LIVEHAPPY set the pace on the inside and weakened in the stretch while just missing the show award. FIRST TRUMPET chased the
pace three wide, then was four wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
BARGAINING POWER was taken in hand while letting the pacesetter cross over then tracked that rival on the outside, ranged up in the two path on the
turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths, took the lead into upper stretch and drew clear under steady urging. GRAND AGAIN moved in while going to the
front, showed the way with a solo advantage, vied inside on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging while under threat, lost the advantage to the
winner into upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. MUNNY FOR NUTHIN broke a step slow, moved up on the outside, chased in the
three path on the turn, came four wide into upper stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and tired. COMPROMISER was hustled from the gate
then taken in hand behind the leader early, raced just off the pace under some restraint, dropped back under urging while saving ground on the turn, came
out five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. EDITOR'S CHOICE stumbled at the start and was off a step slow, drifted in and nearly
skimmed the rail early, moved out in the vicinity of the nine-sixteenths, dropped back in to save ground on the turn and was no factor then was eased in the
final furlong but walked off.

CLUBHOUSE chased the early pace from the outside, made a five wide move on the turn, came wide into the lane and had a long drive and got up late to
prevail. KUPP set a pressured pace on the inside, turned back a bid on the turn and then drifted out through the stretch while running on gamely but was
caught late to just miss. ALTERNATE REALITY was allowed to settle early, swung out six wide leaving the turn and rallied well, shifted in late for racing
room and got the show award. DEVIL'S CAY tracked the early pace four wide, made a four wide bid on the turn while in between rivals, was in contention
off the turn but hung late losing the show award. TEN CENT TOWN stalked the pace three wide and weakened in the drive. ROCK THE WEEKEND chased
the early pace, two wide on the turn and had no rally. JOKING WAY was bumped at the start, pressed the pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to vie
for command but came up empty. STREET SWAGG chased the early pace, saved ground on the turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
SHE'S MO BUBBLY raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path on the far turn, gained
the lead at the five-sixteenths, was asked for her best in upper stretch, fought outside the runner-up to the finish and prevailed under steady urging. COPPA
GIRL went to the front, traveled around the first turn in the two path, showed the way on the inside of a rival, was asked while inside on the far turn, lost the
advantage near the five-sixteenths, fought on gamely with the winner in the stretch but missed while clear for the place. SWEETIE moved from the two path
to the four path on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused near the seven-sixteenths pole, chased three wide on the far turn, remained on her
inside lead until the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. FREUDIAN bumped lightly
with a foe at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the far outside, was urged four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted
out in the vicinity of the furlong marker and failed to rally. PARIS STYLE (FR) moved from the rail to the two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, was
urged three wide on the far turn and came up empty. DREAMAWAYSEVEN lost her footing at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at
the rear, saved ground under urging on the far turn and was no factor. OCEAN GATEWAY bumped with foes at the start, checked while pinched back
between horses early then angled in, saved ground under tight restraint while keen along the rail on the opening bend, was reserved towards the rear, went
three then four wide under urging on the far turn and failed to respond. ICHIBAN was well placed on the inside, dropped back on the far turn and
capitulated.

Footnotes
NARCISO DALI stalked the early pace five to four wide, made a four wide bid on the turn, then was clear by the sixteenth marker and drew away to prove
best under crop urging. NATURAL HARBOR set a pressured pace early on the inside, then vied inside a duo on the turn while in the two path, gained a
short lead off the turn but was headed leaving the furlong marker and could not match strides with the winner late, clearly second best. THE COBBLER was
off a step slow, chased the pace from the outside, made a five wide move on the turn to be in contention off the turn but flattened out, bested rest. PINE
VALLEY was away alertly to press the pace three wide, then was between rivals up on the pace on the turn but faded. BAYOU SPIRIT was reserved early,
two wide on the turn, angled out seven wide leaving the turn and improved position late. RETURN THE RING was settled early, inside on the turn and had
no rally. BORLETTI (IRE) tracked the early pace, saved ground on the turn and dropped out. SCREAMING UNCLE chased the pace three wide and
weakened. COLLECT FROM IKE was settled early, four wide on the turn, came wide off the turn while being no threat.

Footnotes
ROCKET AND ROLL bumped with a rival after the start, was well placed just off the pace, drafted two then three wide on the turn, was asked at the
quarter-pole, chased into the final furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole and got up to prevail. DR. KRAFT showed speed on the outside, disputed
the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the three path on the turn, took a short lead at the five-sixteenths, was asked for his best in upper stretch, led
into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to hold the place. WARALO bumped with a foe after the start, moved up under urging to dispute the pace
between horses, was asked in the two path while still between foes on the turn, fought on well in the stretch and missed while narrowly able to get the show.
LEFTEMBEHIND settled on the outside, was roused three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly. LOCKE AND KEY
climbed some while urged along towards the rear, went mostly three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved in behind foes while chasing
into the final furlong, shifted a bit further in near the sixteenth-pole and also finished willingly. LEO AND ROYAL broke out at the start, moved up under
urging to contest the pace on the inside of two opponents, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back under the crop into upper stretch and was
outfinished. KID BILLY stalked the pace on the outside, was given his cue while four wide on the turn and lacked the needed kick. AMEDEUS MUSIC was
last away then corrected while near bumping foes, moved in while taken under restraint at the rear, angled from the two path to the four path while roused
on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
DISARMED was away alertly to set a pressured pace on the inside, headed on the turn but shook clear off the turn and was clear by the furlong marker,
then held well to prove best under strong handling. OCEAN'S RESERVE was rated along early while under a nice hold, two to three wide on the turn, tipped
out five wide for aim and finished well when asked but could not get to the winner, clearly second best. BEZOS stalked the early pace from the outside,
made a four wide advance on the turn and made a bid off the turn but hung late. SHIPSATIONAL was settled back early, shifted out and was five wide by
the quarter pole, then had a belated rally on the outside to gain the last spot in the superfecta. KUNSHAN BRIDGE was settled early, three wide on the turn,
swung out six wide leaving the turn and had a mild late gain but needed more. BEST BET prompted the winner three wide early, then was between rivals on
the turn while vying for command, but weakened in the final furlong. JUST CALL RAY was settled early, two wide on the turn and came four wide into the
lane but offered no significant rally. LEDDY broke a little flat footed and was reserved early on the inside and failed to respond. SAVINGS RATE was off a
half a beat slow, then moved up to chase the pace four to three wide, was asked nearing the five sixteenth marker but came up empty.

Footnotes
MY SHEA D LADY was hustled from the start then urged along just off the pace, chased inside on the turn, squeezed through along the rail to make a bid in
upper stretch, took the lead coming to the furlong marker, came out just inside that marker while shaking clear and proved best under strong urging. WALK
WITH ME was coaxed along towards the front, jostled with a rival late on the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch,
altered out nearing the furlong marker and finished willingly for the place. ELITE STATUS was urged along on the outside, chased four wide on the turn,
gained to take a narrow advantage in upper stretch, lost the lead coming to the furlong marker and was out-kicked while able to get the show. SUN AND
WIND broke out at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired. MISS
LAO settled off the pace, angled from the two path to the five path on the turn and improved position. ARTEMIS GIRL was ridden along on the outside, went
five wide on the turn, chased while remaining on her inside lead in the stretch and lacked the needed response. MY PERFECT MISTAKE chased the pace,
jostled with a foe late on the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn and came up empty. SOLOSHOT was hustled to the lead, set the pace under
pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way. BOOK OF WISDOM dropped back under urging
near the five-eighths pole, angled from three to six wide on the turn gained into upper stretch, held a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but
had nothing left. E STORMY was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. HOLDER CLOSE
dropped back under urging, moved in early on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. TOUR JETE was last away, settled off the
pace, was urged three wide on the turn and also failed to respond. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF SUN AND WIND CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST

Footnotes
KAYMUS chased the pace, made a bid near the half-mile pole, took the lead in the two path just inside the seven-sixteenths, shook clear at the
five-sixteenths, responded well under a hand-ride into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead when given one pop of a right-handed crop at the
sixteenth-pole and just held. MANGIA was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked while four then three wide on the turn, pursued
the winner in the stretch, gained in the final sixteenth and missed while well clear for the place. MEL'S ANGEL was urged along at the rear, went two to
three wide on the turn, came out some into upper stretch, moved in near the furlong marker and improved position. NIGERIA raced towards the back,
angled from the rail to the four path on the turn, remained on her left lead while behind horses to the furlong marker then shifted out and missed the show.
NO LAYUPS bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. SIX O
THREE broke in and bumped with an opponent, was urged along towards the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and
was no factor. AWESOME GLO chased the early pace then dropped back, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to
rally. KHALI'S STORM was urged along on the inside of a rival, went four then three wide on the turn and came up empty. DACTILOGRAFA was urged
along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. SOL EMPERATRIZ showed good speed and set the pace, lost the lead while along the
rail early on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and tired. HIGH TRACK chased the early pace then dropped back, went two to three wide on the
turn, was taken in hand off heels outside the quarter-pole, swung five wide into the stretch and had nothing left.
