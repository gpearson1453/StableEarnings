Footnotes
MYSTIC SEAPORT showed good early speed while being pressured from the outside by Sister Supream, shook clear around the far turn and drew off
through the stretch while being kept to pressure. ROYAL WHISPER was off slowly, pulling hard from the inside while racing keen early under a strong hold,
angled out through the upper stretch to race from the outside of Mystic Seaport but was no match for the winner in the drive. SISTER SUPREAM pressed
the early leader early from the outside and faded. UTTERLY ENCHANTING chased three deep early, was four wide around the far turn and had no
response. CLICK TO CONFIRM dropped back early, was four wide into the upper lane and failed to respond.

Footnotes
IRISH LACE settled off the early going, made a quick bid from the outside into the far turn, raced two deep between rivals near the quarter pole, dug in late
and prevailed under all out pressure. VIKING QUEEN stalked the pace, moved up two to three wide around the far turn, swung five wide and finished
gamely to the wire. REDWHITEANDTACOS raced in tight quarters from the inside near the half mile pole, checked sharply near the three eighths marker,
angled out through the upper stretch to race from the far outside, jockey misjudged the wire while standing up early and finished gamely in a troubled trip.
THUNDER BUGGY showed good early foot from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. POUNDING MUSIC stalked the pace from the inside
and faded. MERGER OF EQUALS raced off the early pace, was four to five wide around the far turn, raced from the outside in the stretch and never
threatened. RED WIND stalked the pace from the outside and tired readily.

Footnotes
STORMING CHROME prompt the early leader from the outside, had full command near the quarter pole and drew off to be well clear under steady
pressure. KING COVEE stalked the pace, moved up three wide around the far turn, raced from the outside in the stretch and was no match for the winner to
be clearly second best. AGARRAMESIPUEDES raced off the early pace, was near the inside around the far turn through the upper stretch, angled out just
inside the eighth pole and moved up to improve position. JOLLY BY GOLLY was forced to check into the first turn, rated along the inside under a firm hold,
eased out three to four wide in the stretch and was even with no closing bid. VICTORS VALIANT showed good early foot from the inside and gave way.
SUCCEED was void of early speed, lost ground and trailed.

TRITONE GAL pressed the early leader from the outside two deep, took full command through the far turn, raced well off the inside in drive and held well
under strong handling. WHATSYOURBIGIDEA was shuffled back at the start, raced in tight quarters near the half mile pole while racing near the rail, found
room to be hard ridden into the far turn, took aim into the upper stretch but couldn't get by in a game effort. DIVINE ROMANCE settled off the early pace
setters, raced from the inside around the far turn, eased out through the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. BLOME vied for the early lead
from the inside and weakened while racing well off the inside. RECKLESS KELLY void of early speed, raced six deep near the three sixteenths pole and
had no response. CLASSY NANCY dropped back early, swung eight wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. FLIMSY chased the top pair from the
inside and tired readily.

Footnotes
VIXSINZKELTKBANSHE tracked the top pair three wide from the outside and finished well to edge clear under steady handling. VISUAL ILLUSION dropped
back early, raced near the inside around the far turn, shifted five wide and finished gamely to the wire. PUNKIN dropped back to race mid pack early, moved
up three to four wide around the far turn, drifted through the stretch run and kept on willingly to the wire. PREAKNESS PARTY was off slowly, veered out
sharply, lag early to race far back while racing in hand, raced four to five wide in the stretch and moved up well when asked to make a good late gain. HERE
WE GO AGAIN raced off the early pace, was six deep into the upper stretch and had no response. PALMARY pressed outside of foe and faded.
GINAMAYA set a pressured pace along the inside and tired readily.
