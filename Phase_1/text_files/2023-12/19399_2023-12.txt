dueling between horses down the lane battling to the end. CONGRATS THIS well back early circled out on the far turn emerging in upper stretch looming at
mid track hanging late. MAJOR LLOYD gave a middle move pressing through the turn dueling in upper stretch weakening late. EMPEROR'S GOLD pressed
the pace extending on the far turn vying inside in upper stretch weakening late. DYNAFORM raced evenly fading on the far turn. KRAZY HAWK played no
factor. THE WAYNE FACTOR raced mid pack tiring on the far turn. HOLY TRUTH pressed the early pace wilting on the far turn.
