Footnotes
SPUNKY ONE settled in hand just off the leaders down the backside while four wide in the clear, steadily advanced through the turn to engage the
pacesetter in mid-stretch and wore that one down in the drive determinedly. IT'S E Z sped off to open a clear advantage shortly from the gate, responded
when engaged by the winner but could not hold that one off in a good effort. WINGS OF HEAVEN stalked the pace from the fence to be in striking distance
at the head of the lane and failed to mount a closing rally. HOT PRINCESS prompted the pace to the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. WINDY
DANCER broke a step slow, shied from outside rival leaving the gate to drift well into the gap, was straightened away and galloped home.

HISTORYINTHEMAKING reserved off the early pace, made a steady rally in a long drive from four wide through the turn to engage the leader turning for
home, dueled with the runner-up down the stretch and edged away late to prevail. LIGHTENING LOTTIE stalked the pace from three wide, assumed
command midway around the bend, battled with the winner through the lane and was out-finished in the final yards in a game effort. COWGIRLS HUMOR
prompted the early pace from three wide into the turn, dropped back on the bend losing position and finished evenly to gain the show. RIVER HUSTLER
trailed most of the way as a non-threat. SOMETHING LUCKY rushed up the inside to take the lead shortly from the gate, set the pace for to the
five-sixteenths pole and weakened.

YOU BET A FORTUNE broke alertly to take command from the gate, set a well measured pace, repelled the challenge of the runner-up turning or home
and drew clear in the lane while wandering about. POKER PARTNER bobbled at the start, quickly recovered ranging up to press the pace, made a bold bid
nearing the quarter pole but failed to sustain his rally in the stretch. LUCKY COUGAR stalked the pacesetters to be well positioned in the turn and failed to
mount a closing rally. EL BAMBINO tracked the leaders from the inside and lacked a closing response. ROYALLY FLUSHED trailed most of the way and
showed mild late interest. MOONLIGHT JOKER was one-paced and never threatened.

while dueling down the stretch and prevailed late in the drive. WOODLAND WALK pressed the early pace, assumed command on the turn, dueled with the
winner the length of the stretch while put in tight quarters along the fence and was out-finished in the final strides. GILLIGAN set a pressured pace to
midway on the turn, could not go with the top pair but kept on through the lane to hold the show. SAVVY LAYLA broke a step slow to be at the back, tracked
the leaders through the turn and lacked a closing response. LOST IN MANHATTAN was outrun.

Footnotes
GOOD MUSIC hopped at the start, immediately settled into stride, caught wide through the first turn, steadily gained ground to take command turning for
home and finished willingly as clearly the best. WHISKEY HELPS slow early to be well at the rear for the first half mile, rallied in the final bend while being
committed to be nine wide and finished well to take the place. NO MAS CERVEZA showed speed to take the lead through the first turn, settled into a
stalking position down the backside, was set to a drive nearing the quarter pole to threaten and continued to grind down the lane. HARSH TRUTH reserved
off the pace in mid-pack to the far turn, rallied coming for home while fanned eight wide and came home evenly. BUCKEYE CHARLIE tracked the leaders
through the final turn to be well placed at the head of the lane and had no closing punch. SWEET JILL'S JACK set the pace down the backside on a clear
lead and weakened turning for home. THE GOSPEL OF MARK was never a threat.

Footnotes
IRON BERTIE took command leaving the gate, set a well measured pace, responded when called upon turning for home and pulled clear in the stretch.
FALL CAMPAIGN stalked the pace from the on-set, lost ground in the bend and kept coming in a determined drive to be second best. BIG BANG BLUE
tracked the leaders from four wide into the turn, made a bid to engage the pacesetter at the quarter pole and failed to sustain the rally in the stretch.
ENCHANTED MELODY reserved off the pace in mid-pack racing between rivals and rallied mildly late in the lane. DULCE VICTORIA was well placed in
contention through the turn and kept on through the stretch without menacing. ROSE KNOWS shuffled at the start to trail the field, circled the field to gain
position down the backside and finished with interest. PURDY PUMKIN unhurried early, made steady gains to mid-stretch and flattened out late in the drive.
POLITICAL ASTRAY slow early to be at the rear of the field, circled nine wide turning for home and passed tiring rivals. VAVITE tracked the leaders to the
quarter pole and lacked a closing kick. MYRA FLEENER was never a threat. LORI'S EYES pressed the pace to the turn and gave way. MOON PARTY
steadily faded to be no factor.

Footnotes
HUNTER SCOTT stalked the pace through the far turn, saved ground while rallying turning for home, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and
finished in a determined drive to prevail. STAR HAWK tracked the pace from the rail to the far turn, angled around the leaders to mount a closing bid and
finished well through the lane. ZERO GRAVITY shuffled at the start to give the field several lengths, trailed to the far turn and launched a belated rally in a
good effort having been hampered at the beginning. BIG TRUCK well placed throughout in striking distance, circled three wide to loom boldly turning for
home and was out-kicked in the stretch. STRIKE APPEAL failed to menace. COME SEE ABOUT IT raced up from between horses making a middle move
down the backstretch to be prominent and flattened out turning for home. DISCLOSURE was not a threat. GOING IN STYLE set the pace through the turn
and gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
THE PINK Z pressed the pace throughout, engaged the leader at the head of the lane, battled with that one to the wire and prevailed in the final strides.
OUR BUCKWHEAT set the pace under constant pressure, responded when called upon turning for home, dueled the length of the stretch with the winner
from between horses late and just missed. TEAM LEYENDECKER tracked the pace from the inside to the quarter pole, chased the leaders down the lane,
angled to the inside of the top pair and was gaining in the final stride to come up just short. HITE reserved off the pace to the head of the stretch and lacked
a closing kick. KNOCK WOOD bobbled start and never menaced from there. WETZEL stalked the pace for a half mile and flattened out. DASH OF FIRE
trailed and never posed a threat.

Footnotes
G T THREE FIFTY set a pressured pace to the top of the lane, shook clear when called upon and drew away convincingly. C V JERSEY BEE stalked the
pace into the turn, ranged up to challenge at the quarter pole, could not go with the winner and chased that one down the lane as second best. YIPPEE KI
YAY tracked the leaders to the bend, rallied three wide to loom up turning for home and flattened out in the stretch. CONSTITUTION COAL well placed
along the inside to contend and lacked a closing bid. HOTROD BOBBY failed to menace. RAY'S EMPIRE passed weaker rivals in the lane as a non-threat.
FAST CLIP showed brief speed and was through early. I STRONG was not a factor.
