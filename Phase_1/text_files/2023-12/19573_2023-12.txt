Footnotes
NORFIE was prompted from up close in the three path, ranged up in the four path turning into the stretch, swept to the lead while drifting in passing the
eighth pole, and drew clear. TIZADUKE tracked inside, was driven along the rail turning into the lane, had to alter out to the four path passing the eighth
pole, and chased on for place. ROMPING RUNNER broke out at the start, chased between foes in the two path, fanned out to the seven path under a drive
turning into the stretch, tipped into the five path passing the eighth pole, and was up for show. LAST SHIFT dueled for the lead inside, tipped out to the two
path around the turn, held a clear lead turning into the stretch, but lost the lead before the eighth pole, and faded in the final furlong. VANISHING INTEREST
had a slow start, raced wellback in the two path, was under right handed encouragement around the turn, angled out to the six path in upper stretch, but
was no factor. MAKIZAN had an awkward start, raced off the pace in the four path, was driven in the six path around the turn, merged into the two path at
the top of the stretch, but did not threaten. JACKSON'S WEBB bumped with an inner foe at the start, vied for the lead in the two path, floated out to the
three path around the turn, and weakened in upper stretch. DOC BALLARD got bumped at the start, trailed in the four path and never menaced.

Footnotes
BEECHNUT TROPHY tracked in the two path, was coaxed midway around the far turn, bid from the rail into the stretch, took the lead just after the eighth
pole, and inched clear. HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES broke out at the start, raced up close in the three path, was cued passing the quarter, and ran on from the
four path down the lane to place. CHORUS GIRL set the pace in the two path, was roused passing the three-eighths, kept on between foes in upper stretch,
but was outlasted on both sides to show. STARSHIP AGENDA bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the four path, was driven from the five path
into the stretch, and mildly stayed on. PENUMBRAS MAKER was held up in midpack in the three path, tipped inwards under a drive turning into the stretch,
but finished evenly. GOOD AMERICAN (GB) raced off the pace in the three path, floated out to the eight path under a ride turning into the stretch, but made
no impact. BATUCADA got pinballed at the start, trailed in the five path, fanned out to the nine path turning into the lane, but did not factor. CIGAMIA was
bothered by an inner foe to bump into an outer foe at the start, stalked in the four path but weakened in the stretch. LADY OUTOFTHE BLUE rated inside
but backed up around the far turn.

LIGHT AND PATH stalked in the three path, waited in the two path rounding the turn, was roused while swinging out to the six path into the stretch, took the
lead just after the eighth pole, inched clear, was pulled up after the gallop out, and walked off. AMOR Y CONTROL bumped with an inner foe at the start,
vied for the lead in the four path, was coaxed from the three path around the turn, tipped out to the five path at the top of the stretch, ran on and held a short
lead passing the eighth pole, but was outfinished by an outer foe late to place. INTO TOURING raced off the pace in the five path, ranged up passing the
quarter, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. BULLOCK chased in the three path, had to steady midway around the
turn, and finished evenly. VAL'S GAL trailed in the four path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, and made no impact. LOVIELEE prompted
the pace in the six path but yielded turning into the stretch. EILAT tracked inside but backed up around the turn. WHATS GOIN ON bumped with an outer
foe at the start, dueled for the lead in the two path, was cued turning into the stretch, but gaveway.

ROMAGNA MIA (GB) settled off the pace while racing two wide, cruised up three wide around the far turn, seized command near the quarter pole and drew
off under left-handed urging. TASS vied two wide around the first turn, cleared nearing the clubhouse turn, set the pace along the rail from there to the
quarter pole, was no match for the winner but kept on well to hold second. VIVA LA RED vied inside of TASS around the first turn, settled into a stalking
position nearing the second turn, stalked two wide from there, could not match strides with the winner nearing the quarter pole but stayed on well enough to
hold the show. MISS YEARWOOD saved ground off the pace, advanced three wide around the far turn and flattened out in the drive. COCO stalked the
pace inside and faded in the stretch. MAMAN JOON (IRE) saved ground off the pace, launched a four wide bid into contention around the far turn but came
up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
JUST FOR LUCK tracked the pace four wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, steadily gained through the lane, put a head in front near the
sixteenth pole and outdueled a stubborn IMMENSE FAITH late. IMMENSE FAITH stalked the pace three wide, took over near the three-eighths pole, set the
pace in the three path around the far turn, led to the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. PLEASE BABY raced off the pace two wide, edged closer two
wide around the far turn, could not keep pace with the top two in upper stretch but stayed on to gain the show. NOBLE TIGER pressed the pace two wide,
took the lead midway down the backstretch, vied inside of foes in the two path around the far turn and weakened in the drive. BRAGGADOCIOUS failed to
menace while racing four and five wide. TIO TONY broke slowly, raced two and three wide and never threatened. PHOBIA failed to menace while racing
three wide. BOURBON CLEARANCE set the early pace along the rail and was through after a half. EL CHICO MALO was outrun inside.
