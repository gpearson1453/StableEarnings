EAGLES CRY settled off the early pace racing just off the inside, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and finished well to just get up under strong
handling. HORN OF PLENTY stalked the early leader, made a two wide bid near the quarter pole, took a narrow lead into the upper lane, dug in near the
rail and just missed in a game effort. ALEXIS S chased the top pair, made a three wide bid through the far turn, dug between late and finished gamely to the
wire. LEGAL DEAL stalked the pace, race along the inside around the far turn through the upper stretch, angled out four deep nearing the sixteenths pole
and finished willingly to the wire. ROMANTIC GAMBLE lag early on to trail, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no late rally. BEST
DEFENSE sprinted clear early and was empty near the quarter pole. Internal racing fractional times were unavailable.

SAVAGE DRAGON tracked the early leader early, urged into the far turn, dueled with Cali Heat through the far turn from the outside and edged clear late
under strong handling. CALI HEAT dueled through the far turn near the rail, dug in near the eighth pole and gave way to the winner grudgingly. EMPTY MY
POUCH was off slowly, advanced just off the inside through the far turn, raced six deep near the three sixteenths pole, gained ground late and closed in
gamely to the wire. CHASIN' WHISKEY raced off the early going, raced along the inside around the far turn and made a mild late gain racing four wide.
OUR ANDREW B settled off the early pace setters, swung seven wide into the lane and had not enough in the drive. TAPACHILL was slow early, saved
ground and never threatened. REBEL INVASION was sent along from the inside and gave way.

LONDON LADY rated along the inside, confidently handled through the far turn, made a good rail bid in the drive and got up under strong handling. MY
SWEET SUMMER tracked the early leader from the outside, made a four wide bid near the quarter pole and finished gamely to the wire. CURLIN'S DOVE
showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside, had a clear lead near the eighth pole and weakened late. DISCO DAISY was coaxed along
from the inside early and weakened. RIGHTOFFTHEBENCH stalked the pace from the outside, loomed four to five wide around the far turn and flattened
out. LET'S GO MO lag early to trail, saved ground and had no rally.

MAKOTO set his own uncontested early pace and held well to be clear under strong handling. I'M NOT A BABY tracked the early leader from the inside and
finished gamely to the wire. LUDO stalked the pace, raced four wide around the far turn and kept on willingly to the wire. STORMY FIRE raced off the early
going, was near the inside nearing the quarter pole, shifted five wide and raced even late. SPIRITUAL GHOST sent into the first turn, trailed early and failed
to respond. GREATEST WARRIOR tracked the early leader two deep and gave way.

off the early going, made an early move three wide near the three eighths pole and was no match for the winner in the drive. TEACHER DRAMA dropped
back to race mid pack early, was five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. SWITCHRATTLENROLL stalked the pace from the outside, ridden
three wide near the three eighths pole and weakened through the drive. BAMBOO GARDEN void of early speed, raced from the inside into the upper stretch
and raced evenly. ALWAJD forwardly placed early on, checked sharply near the three eighths pole, raced five wide around the far turn and tired. ARCTICA
showed good early foot and gave way. CIRCLE OF COURAGE stalked the pace, was done early and eased up on in the stretch.
