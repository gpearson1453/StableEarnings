Footnotes
SPEED RUNNER prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, was asked on the far turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole, dueled outside of the
runner-up in the stretch and prevailed under strong urging. MALARCHUK went to the front, showed the way on the inside, departed the backstretch under
urging, lost the lead while put to the crop at the quarter-pole, fought on gamely inside of the winner, dueled with that foe to the finish and just missed while
clear for the place. SOCIETY MAN bumped with an opponent at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused three then
four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong and weakened. ELIMINATE bobbled at the start then bumped with a foe,
moved in to save ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused two to three wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response. REASONED
ANALYSIS bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground on the first turn, moved out inside the three-quarter pole, was forwardly placed on the outside,
chased three wide on the far turn, made a bid in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. GUM ISLAND went
around the first turn in the two path, was ridden along at the rear, rounded the far turn in the two path and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DUNE ROAD set the early pace while in the two path, well handled on the turn, kicked clear leaving the quarter pole, then changed leads a couple of times
in the final sixteenth while clear under mild urging. UNION BULLDOG was rated early on the inside, shifted out to be two wide by the five sixteenths, then
dropped back to the inside leaving the turn, angled out in the furlong marker for aim and finished willingly, second best. ALLEGRINI stalked the early pace
and made a three wide bod on the turn to loom boldly at the quarter pole but came up empty in the lane, bested rest. SHAMROCK SHAKE was settled early
on the outside, made a four wide move on the turn to be in contention by the quarter pole, but then was empty. SHEER DOMINANCE was off slowly to trail
early, shifted out and was five wide by the quarter pole and failed to threaten. GET READY TO ROCK was well placed on the inside, fell back on the turn,
swung out five wide leaving the turn and tired.

Footnotes
SUE ELLEN MISHKIN was hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked near the five-sixteenths, responded well when put to the crop in
upper stretch and held under strong urging. FONTANAFREDDA was hustled from the gate, established position just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn,
raced under tight restraint while off the heels of the leader passing the five-sixteenths, shifted to the two path while asked at the quarter-pole, pursued the
winner in the drive, gained on that foe late and just missed while well clear for the place. LIBERTY FLAME stalked the pace on the outside of the leader,
was given her cue in the two path on the turn, dropped back four wide into the stretch and weakened but held the show. BEHIND THE COUCH broke out
and was last to commence, was urged early then settled on the outside, went five wide while roused on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response. DIVA BANKER raced just off the pace, chased in the four path on the turn and tired. FREDDYMO FACTOR dropped well
behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, moved out inside the furlong marker and was no factor.
MERAVIGLIOSO tracked the pace, chased in the three path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
LORD VICENTE (ARG) was bumped at the start, taken back early to be far back early, advanced four wide on the turn, shifted out in the lane and closed
well on the outside under left handed crop to get up late to prove best. EGYPT chased the early pace three wide while being nudged along, then was in the
two path on the turn, three wide off the turn, then shifted to the inside and finished well but was out-kicked by the winner. LUCENCY was bumped at the
start, then was well placed early on the inside, shifted out and made a three wide bid on the turn, dueled for command by the quarter pole and battled to the
sixteenth marker and then faded late, held show award. VENGE set the pace on the inside, then was in the two path on the turn, headed at the quarter pole
and dueled for the command but gave way grudgingly. AUTHORIZE stalked the pace three wide, made a four wide bid on the turn, then came six wide off
the turn and was empty. AMANI'S TIGER was allowed to settle on the inside and saved ground on the turn and had no impact.

Footnotes
PERSISTENT DANGER tracked the pace, was asked in the four path on the turn, chased into upper stretch, gained to make a bid inside the
three-sixteenths, fought outside the runner-up into the final sixteenth and got up to prevail. MOVING PICTURES chased the pace, came out leaving the
backstretch, pursued the leader in the two path on the turn, took the advantage in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught
while able to get the place. BIG SAVE bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, angled from the four path to the rail on the turn, chased in the
two path into the final furlong, dropped to the rail in pursuit of the top two in the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the show. JOHN'S PROTEGE
bumped with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, raced two path to the inside on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. SORPRESO broke out then was corrected with tug of the left rein, dropped well behind the rest of the field, went around the turn in the two path
and failed to threaten. CHARGER was forwardly placed on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. WARTAPPED broke out but came out in front, angled in while showing good speed, set the pace, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead to the runner-up
in upper stretch, remained on her inside lead in the drive and weakened. BRUNATE settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, shifted to the two path
outside the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch and also lacked the needed response. MACH ONE moved up while hard ridden then chased the pace,
went three wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

MAD BANKER was well placed early two wide, then was boxed on the turn and waited nearing the quarter pole, cut corner and closed well up the inside to
get up and edged clear late to prove best, driving. BRACA pressed the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn, gained command nearing the
furlong marker but was caught late while being second best. SAHANATIEN was off slowly and then ducked in at the start spotting the field many lengths,
made four wide move on the turn and came five wide into the lane between rivals, but needed more late while getting the show award. RETAIL MAN was
rated early on the outside, made a five wide move on the turn, came six wide off the turn and made a bid but flattened out late. SOLO TONIGHT chased the
early pace towards the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn, then was blocked by the three sixteenths, angled out to the far outside for racing room
and had a belated rally. A KNIGHT'S COURAGE vied for the early lead and made a bid on the inside, then shifted off the inside leaving the turn and
weakened the final furlong. THE DELAWARE BOYZ vied for the lead three wide and weakened in the lane. HOW U DOIN was reserved early and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
BON ADIEU displayed good speed, showed the way under some pressure to her outside, shook clear along the rail on the turn, responded well when asked
for her best in upper stretch and proved much the best under steady urging. DUCKPHAT angled out leaving the chute while urged along off the pace,
moved in late on the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, remained on her inside lead until inside the
furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead, was guided further out near the sixteenth-pole then came between foes and got up for the place. BELLA
PRINCIPESSA was forwardly placed on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and proved no match then missed the
place while just able to get the show. MISS KRISTY dropped well back while urged along, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, swung five wide
into the stretch and improved position. MIM was away alertly then well placed just off the pace, saved ground while roused on the turn and lacked the
needed response. I FEEL THE NEED was bumped in the hindquarters at the start then was void of speed, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into
the stretch and failed to threaten. JOLLY MISS JILL tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn and tired. CHASING
DAYLIGHT broke out and bumped the hindquarters of a rival then checked, settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, moved out in upper
stretch and failed to respond. LEADERSHIP ABILITY stalked the pace on the outside, dropped back in the two path on the turn, chased into the stretch and
retreated.

Footnotes
PEAK OF CHIC was bumped at the start, set the pace while in hand, then was sent down by the three sixteenths and kicked clear, then remained clear to
the wire to prove best, driving. MISSING FORTUNE was bumped at the start, tracked the pace three wide early, shifted out and made a four wide move on
the turn, came widest off the turn and finished willingly to be second best. TEMPERMENTAL stalked the pace three wide and came four wide off the turn but
lacked the needed winning bid, bested rest. RIBOT'S VALENTINE tracked the early pace from between rivals, then steadied while in tight by the five and
half furlong marker, shuffled back entering the turn, then lacked a solid rally. KHALI MAGIC was hustled along the inside early, bumped by the five and half
furlong marker, then hesitated off heels by the seven sixteenths and weakened the final quarter of a mile.

Footnotes
GEORGE'S VICE pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead leaving the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, responded well when set down in
the three path into upper stretch, battled inside of the runner-up while drifting out some in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under good handling.
ARMY OF THOUGHTS chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch,
battled outside the winner while remaining on her inside lead until near the sixteenth-pole then swapped to the proper lead and just missed. TERESA was
hustled from the gate then urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and
closed well but missed while clear for the show. RED BUTTERFLY was coaxed along off the pace, came under stronger encouragement in the two path on
the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. MAXING THE BANK was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. FIRST CLASS CAT was sent hard to the front, showed the way under pressure to her outside, lost the
lead leaving the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and capitulated. RUN CHATA dropped back at the start while
hustled then was ridden along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and was no factor.
