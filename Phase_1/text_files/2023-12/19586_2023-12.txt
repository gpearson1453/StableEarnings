Footnotes
OKAY FINE stalked in the three path, was roused to bid three wide midway around the far turn, took a clear lead while floating out to the six path in upper
stretch, and held sway. GREY PRINCESS rated between foes in the two path, waited early around the far turn, was cued while tipping out to the four path at
the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. STARSHIP SIGRUN trailed along the inside, tipped out passing the half, was driven five wide around the far turn,
fanned out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. BATTLING BUBBLES hopped at the start and was rank turning into the
backstretch, raced off the pace in the three path, was ridden four wide around the far turn, and was one paced from the five path in the stretch. APEROL
SPRITZ prompted the pace in the two path, bid passing the three eighths, took a short lead between foes midway around the far turn, but lost the lead
turning into the lane, and faded. KINDNESS IS FREE had to steady midway around the first turn, tracked inside, but was stymied while along the rail
rounding the far turn, tipped out to the three path turning into the stretch, but did not threaten. ZULLY BELLA set the pace inside but yielded along the rail
turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
MOVIN' ON UP settled in range two wide around the first turn, advanced three wide around the far turn, seized command nearing the sixteenth pole and
drew clear under a drive. MOMMA KIM set a rated pace in the two path, led to the sixteenth pole and held well clear of the rest. CHANNEL LOOP raced off
the pace two and three wide, rallied in the lane and just up for the show. WONDER WAVE (IRE) broke a bit awkwardly, prompted the pace in the three path,
angled to the rail nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. MAYBE MAGIC failed to menace while racing two and three
wide. MADONNINA was outrun inside. LA PICASITA was up close inside and retreated nearing the lane.

Footnotes
KISS ME HARDY raced up close in the two path early, took command after the five-eighths, was coaxed when challenged by an outer foe approaching the
quarter, headed by that same foe while floating out to the five path at the top of the stretch, but dug in to repel that foe, and drew away late. MISS UCRANIA
got bumped by an inner foe at the start, rated in the four path, ranged up midway around the turn, bid passing the quarter, headed the inner eventual winner
while floating out to the seven path in upper stretch, and kept on, but was repelled late to place. KAREN'S HONOR prompted the pace in the four path early,
but lost ground while under a ride around the turn, and was along for show. JELLICLE KATZ stalked in the six path, was ridden along while losing ground
passing the half, and made no impact. SILVIA V'S HEROES broke out and bumped an outer foe, chased out in the seven path and never threatened.
HIDDEN ROAD pressed the pace in the five path but gaveway around the turn.

second best. DREAMY raced off the pace three and four wide and was along for the show. SHE CAN SCAT chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing
bid. CAJUN ANTHEM steadied while racing erratically down the chute, chased the pace two wide and faded through the lane. MY SWEETHEART DANI
failed to menace while racing five wide. WHATS UP BUTTERCUP was outrun inside. ELLIE'S RUNNER had brief speed inside. MO TWILIGHT had speed
two wide and was through early.

ROYAL DAME chased in the three path, was ridden along the inside into the far turn, swung out to six path at the top of the lane, and stayed on to draw
past an inner foe around the sixteenth. MY LION (GB) set the pace in the two path, was nudged along around the far turn, coaxed while tipping out to the
five path going into the stretch, kept on into the final furlong, but was caught around the sixteenth by an outer foe to place. QUEEN MACHA pulled around
the first turn to race up close in the three path down the backside, was roused going into the far turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and
finished evenly for show. MINT EDITION steadied midway around the first turn, prompted the pace in the four path but faded turning into the stretch. APPLE
SHAKE SHAKE raced off the pace in the two path but never menaced.

and widened handily. TIZ MARKS SPIRIT chased the pace four wide, was no match for the winner but won the place duel. WASAMATTAFOYOU stumbled
at the start, raced off the pace three wide and was along for the show. HEAD LAD prompted the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. TEAM TRAVIS
was hustled to the lead, set the pace in the two path down the backstretch, chased the winner around the turn and tired in the drive. KHOPESH was outrun

SOUPER SUCCESS raced prominently outside of the pacesetter in the four path, bid from the three path going into the turn, led passing the quarter, was
coaxed between foes in the two path at the top of the stretch, lost the lead briefly to FROSTED FAITH passing the eighth pole, but dug in gamely and fought
back to get back up in the final sixteenth. FROSTED FAITH stalked in the three path, loomed in the four path rounding the turn, was roused passing the
quarter, bid in the three path at the top of the lane, ran on to lead passing the eighth pole, but hung, and was repelled by the winner in the final sixteenth to
place. VOLKERT rated in the three path, was cued between foes midway around the turn, tipped out to the five path turning into the stretch, and kept on for
show. AMOR LEJANO (ARG) tracked in the two path, was ridden along the inside around the turn, angled out to the four path going into the stretch, but was
one paced. EXPROMPT (FR) trailed in the two path, tipped out to the five path under a drive turning into the lane, but made no impact. FRIAR TUCK set the
pace in the three path, was coaxed from the two path turning into the stretch, but gaveway. CHEERFUL CHARLIE chased in the five path but never
menaced.

Footnotes
SPACE LAUNCH raced in range two wide, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole, kicked in outside and drew clear under a drive. FIGHTER IN THE WIN
set the pace in the two path, could not resist the winner leaving the eighth pole but held clear of the rest. BRINGER OF RAIN raced off the pace three and
four wide and was along for the show. K. C. CHIEF had early speed inside, bid in the three path around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane
and weakened. RED FLAG ALERT chased the pace three and four wide and faded through the stretch. MR MATUSCHEK was outrun while racing two
wide. ENGLISH PAINTER saved ground off the pace, swung out in upper stretch and never threatened. BIG VENEZUELA was unprepared for the start and
never a factor while saving ground.

Footnotes
TRIKARI set the pace in the three path, was headed by an outer foe passing the half, coaxed in the two path midway around the far turn, tipped back out to
the three path at the top of the stretch, and held sway. MYTHIC PERFORMANCE pressed the winning pacesetter in the four path, headed TRIKARI passing
the half, was cued midway around the far turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the stretch, and ran on to hold place. BREAK OUT stalked in the two
path, waited in the three path rounding the far turn, was coaxed passing the quarter, and chased on from the two path down the lane for show. TEAM
CAPTAIN got bumped by an inner foe at the start, tracked in the five path, was roused into the far turn, floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch,
and was one paced. INHERENT PROMISE checked along the inside leaving the first turn, rated inside down the backstretch, was pushed along while
swinging out to the four path turning into the lane, but made no impact. SALACIOUS broke in and bumped an inner foe at the start, chased in the five path,
fanned out to the eight path under a drive turning into the lane, but failed to bid. ALWAYS BE SMART had a slow start, trailed in the three path and never
threatened from the five path in the stretch. EL REZEEN raced off the pace in the two path but never factored. STREAMSONG bumped with an inner foe at
the start, then had to steady midway around the first turn, laid off the pace in the four path, was driven from the three path into the far turn, but could not
threaten from the two path in the stretch. DANGEROUS DRIVER bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced up close between foes in the three path but
was empty turning into the lane.
