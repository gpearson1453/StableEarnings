Footnotes
SCAT FREE set the pace inside of a sparring rival around the turn, shook free of that one in upper stretch and held sway well. PURPLE OCTOPUS vied for
the lead two wide and outside of the eventual winner, but yielded to that one in upper stretch and lasted for place late. HIGH ENOUGH broke a step slow,
raced off of the pace in the four to five path, then stayed on through the final furlong but ran out of ground to reach place. MAJESTIC CRAKEN was last
away, laid off of the pace in the three path and lacked a bid. DROMAS trailed along the inside and failed to factor. SIXTEEN DEGREES chased the top pair
from the inside, failed to keep pace with them in the two path around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
BE BO prompted in the three path, gained an advantage tucking to the two path approaching the three furlongs pole, dug in to resist an outer challenge
entering the lane and held firm between horses through the final furlong. ALMOST DIALED OUT prompted two wide and between horses early on, backed
off to stalk before shifting outside of foes at the half mile pole, ranged up in the four to three path turning for home, bid in the four path entering the lane, but
failed to gain even terms while drifting out subtly in upper stretch and was kept at bay through the late stages. PURRFECT MOON vied inside early on,
chased from the two path around the turn, aimed to split foes through a large opening three wide in upper stretch, but hung on her left lead and failed to do
so and steadied slightly as the hole gradually closed nearing the furlong grounds, kept on in pursuit, tipped inwardly in the final sixteenth and edged show.
HEY MADALYN CLAIRE led three to two wide and between horses early on, got headed by an outer counterpart while tucking to the inside approaching the
three furlong pole, fought on into deep stretch, but yielded late and missed show. KHOZY TAP chased from midpack in the two path, shifted out to the five
path entering the lane but only offered a mild kick. JESSICA BLAH BLAH lacked speed while hung in the five path around the turn, floated to the seven path
entering the lane and failed to menace. GRACEFUL STREET broke a bit outwardly, pursued from midpack in the four path, entered the lane in the six path
and yielded between horses in the final furlong. SECRET MELODY broke slowly and made little impact two wide. BRIGHTNMORNINGSTAR lacked speed
along the inside and never got involved. MS. PRIESTLY broke outwardly, pursued from off of the pace in the four path and tired.

Footnotes
FINN AND BRENNAN was slammed by an outer rival into an inner foe and pinched back between horses at the start, settled off of the pace two wide,
gained in the four path around the far turn, rallied in pursuit of the tiring leader in the final furlong and reeled in that one in the nearing the wire. MAX IS G
MONEY set the pace in the four to three path around the first turn, bumped his margin approaching the far turn, opened up in the two path around that
bend, maintained a wide margin through midstretch, but weakened in the late stages and was nailed by an outer bidder a few strides from the wire. YO
DADDY was reluctant to load, pursued from midpack in the four to three path, shifted out to the five path entering upper stretch and ran on willingly for a
minor share. SPOKEN CODE broke through the gate pre-race, but was re-loaded without further incident, raced towards the rear along the inside and
moved up between horses. THIS TIME BLUE broke in and firmly bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked two wide, chased the widening leader around
the far turn and tired through the final furlong. PERFORMANCE PLUS broke awkwardly, laid off of the pace hung in the five path around the first turn, then
gave way in the three path and between rivals around the far turn. ENGLISH BOBBY took firm and simultaneous contact from rivals on both sides at the
start, prompted along the inside around the first turn, chased approaching the far turn and weakened in upper stretch. MAX S transferred contact from an
inner rival to an outer foe at the start, then was outrun two wide. DUSTIN THE DIAMOND lacked speed along the inside, shifted out around the far turn and
made little impact. HASTKRAFTER stumbled outwardly at the start, tracked along the inside and weakened turning for home.

MISS ARLINGTON took light contact from an inner rival at the start, prompted outside of the leader, vied in the three path into the turn, led approaching the
five sixteenths pole, then drove clear in upper stretch. CHARRIERE tracked in the four path, ranged up outside of the top pair to enter the lane within striking
distance, but failed to keep pace with the clearing leader in upper stretch and sustained a chase to hold place thereafter. ONEROLLOFTHEDICE tracked
two wide and between horse, chased among foes in upper stretch to edge show at the furlong grounds, flopped back to her left lead in the process and ran
on. NAUGHTY LOTTIE was bumped and floated outwardly by an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted out to the five path in
upper stretch and moved up. RASTANI shifted outwardly and bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside, but lacked rail racing room in
upper stretch, altered out passing the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid thereafter. BALI DREAMIN transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer
foe at the start, set the pace in the two path inside of a prompting foe, got headed by that one approaching the final five sixteenths and weakened while
hanging on her left lead. TAKE CHARGE WOMAN broke outwardly and bumped a rival leaving the gates, trailed in the two to three path, shifted out to the
seven path in upper stretch and was outrun.

VITEMENT tracked the leading pair from the three to two path, took aim outside of them in upper stretch, sustained a grinding charge to range up to the
leader at the sixteenth pole and edged past late. CLASSIC POWER (IRE) set the pace along the inside, inched clear from a chasing pair in upper stretch,
dug in to resist an outer challenge at the sixteenth pole and was bested late. ASPENITE pursued from midpack two wide, shifted out four wide in upper
stretch and ran on to edge show late. COWES stalked two wide, chased while getting outkicked for place at the furlong grounds, then yielded and lost show
late. TIPSY TALES broke half a beat slow, pursued from midpack in the three to four path, then ran on evenly. AWESOME RUTA laid off of the pace in the
four path and between horses, then stayed on in the five path. HIDDEN CLASS was off a step slow, lacked speed along the inside then failed to menace
between horses. VICTORY FOR VETS bobbled a bit leaving the gates, raced at the rear along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch and improved position.
GONE ELVIS broke inwardly, saved ground in midpack but gave way hanging on his left lead. SPONGE BATH laid off of the pace caught in the five to six
path around the turn and faded. LEMON MERINGUE was outrun two wide.

Footnotes
HIDDEN CONNECTION stalked in the four path around the first turn, pressed three wide down the backstretch, vied around the far turn, led in upper stretch
and drove clear. CORNINGSTONE prompted the pace inside of a pair of rivals early on, vied down the backstretch, but was bested her widest counterpart
in upper stretch and held place thereafter. UNBRIDLED MARY tracked from the two path, chased in the two to three path around the far turn, edged show
nearing the furlong grounds and held that position from an inner bidder in the late stages. SKRATCH KAT trailed along the inside, saved ground around
both turns, then ran on to improve inside of rivals through the final furlong and missed reaching show. BOW DRAW set the pace in the three path around the
first turn, between a pair of prompters down the backstretch, but gave way entering the lane and faded thereafter. ROSE PALACE laid off of the pace in the
four path and lacked a bid. THE ALYS LOOK tracked in the three path and between horses around the first turn, but lost position while trying to tip outside of
leading foes down the backstretch, came under urging further off of the pace around the far turn, but lacked a response and was outrun through the lane.

Footnotes
JAMES ALOYSIUS leaned outwardly at the start, showed the way from an outer presser while taking the first turn in the three path, stalked that one entering
the backstretch, rebid outside of him and from the two path around the far turn, then kicked clear in upper stretch and held sway. ALEX JOON settled off of
the pace three wide, rallied between horses to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, sparred with an inner rival for that position through the late stages and
prevailed. KENTUCKY GHOST saved ground in midpack, ran on to bid for place in midstretch, dueled with an outer bidder for that position late but got
outfinished. SPLIT THE WICKETS broke a beat slow, saved ground off of the pace, then stayed on inside of rivals to edge fourth in the final sixteenth. HE'S
GOT THIS raced at the rear along the inside, then t wo to three wide and between horses around the far turn, and stayed on among foes. OCELOT tracked
in the two path to the inside around the first turn, tipped out to take aim in the four path and outside of the leaders in upper stretch, but lacked a bid before
yielded entering the final sixteenth. PARROT HEAD tracked in the three to two path and between horses, floated out to the five path in upper stretch and
faded between horses while hanging on his left lead. BOURBON DAY tracked in the four path, took contact from an inner rival turning for home, was
brushed to the seven path by that one in upper stretch and lacked a bid. SAILING SOLO pursued from the three path, bumped an outer rival turning for
home, brushed that one while shifting to the six path in upper stretch and lacked a rally between horses. GROUP EIGHTEEN laid off of the pace two wide
and between horses and gave way. NATIVE THUNDER broke a step slow, raced at the rear two to three wide, fanned to the eight path in upper stretch and
made little impact. MICROPHONE (IRE) prompted outside of the leader and from the four path, gained an advantage entering the backstretch, crossed over
and showed the way from an outer presser approaching the far turn, got headed by that one nearing the lane and folded between horses.

Footnotes
SUMITUP set a clear pace and held sway. CANADA'S CUSTOMS tracked in the three path and ran on to gain place at the wire. MISS PRIORITY stalked in
the two path, then only managed to chase while hanging on her left lead, yielded in the final furlong and got nailed for place whlie saving show. ROYAL
O'HAIGAIN pursued from the four path, then offered a late grinding charge but missed reaching place. GALAXY THIRTYSIX laid off of the pace in the three
to four path and moved up between horses. LOVERS NEVER SAY broke a step slow, dropped back to pursue from midpack in the two path into the turn
and failed to menace between horses. MISS KENNEDY lacked speed along the inside and failed to threaten. OURS AND THEIRS trailed in the five to six
path and failed to factor. COUNTRY LADY broke a step slow, tracked along the inside, chased entering the lane and weakened. SIENNA BREEZE raced off
of the pace in the five path and gave way.
