Footnotes
DESPITE ODDS rated along early, made a inside move around the far turn, angled out through the upper stretch and finished well to just get up under
strong handling. SMOOTH RICO was bumped at the start, stalked the duel down the backstretch, shook clear near the eighth pole, remained clear inside
the eighth pole and was caught near the wire in a game effort. RASCALLY REBEL broke in, bumped at the start, raced from the inside around the far turn,
angled out and kept on willingly to the wire. DISPUTED NOTION raced in a bit tight at the break, raced two wide near the quarter pole and rallied belatedly
while racing near the inside. SCIENCE (IRE) race off the early going, swung wide into the upper stretch to race from the far outside and closed in belatedly.
NICK'S LITTLE BOY rushed up early from the outside five deep and gave way near the quarter pole. SALOON raced five wide around the far turn, seven
deep into the upper stretch and faded. GABRIEL'S WING showed good early foot two deep under pressure and gave way in the drive. ISLAND D'LITE had
four pursuit from the outside and tired.

WILD BEHAVIOR sent along early, dictate pace two to three wide off the rail and held well to be clear under strong handling. SPITBALL steadied slightly
near the half mile pole, moved up near the rail around the far turn, had an inside run and finished gamely to the wire. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO was
unprepared at the start, lost a considerable amount of ground, raced three wide near the quarter pole, shifted four to five wide and finished gamely to the
wire. HIS NAME IS SUE hard chase from the outside three deep and faded through the drive. RUDY ROD was off a step slow, raced off the early going,
swung six to seven wide and closed in mildly. CLASSY SOLUTION chased the top pair from the inside and gave way. THE CAIRO KID broke to the outside,
hard ridden between two wide nearing the quarter pole and faded.

Footnotes
FULL IRISH showed good early speed from the inside, handled confidently around the far turn, raced three wide through the upper lane, drifted under left
handed urging near the eighth, corrected with right hand urging and was well clear under steady handling. CASTLE ISLAND pressed Full Irish from the
outside down the backstretch, dug in late to secure second place finish while giving way to the winner grudgingly. NASTY HABIT stalked the pace from the
outside early, hard ridden three deep around the far turn and needed more in the drive. MARTY'S MAGIC dropped back to race mid pack early, was near
the rail around the far turn and finished willingly to the wire. HARD TRAVELER hopped at the start, had an inside run and was even with no closing bid.
MOSLER TIME raced off the early going, was four wide through the far turn and never was a factor. TWIRLING EXPRESS stumbled soon after the start,
raced near the back early, three wide around the far turn and was outrun. NAPOLEON'S WAR chased the early pace between and faded.

Footnotes
JEOPARDY JAMES broke awkwardly, raced from the inside early, angled out through the far turn, circled four wide and surged up late under strong
handling. TAKE CHARGE TOO rushed early leader, was near the inside throughout, clear near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly late to the winner.
SUMO dropped back to race mid pack early, angled out near the five sixteenths pole, was six wide near the three sixteenths pole, shifted in and rallied
willingly to the wire. FOOLISH GHOST was reluctant to load, raced four deep near the half mile pole, took aim near the quarter pole and faded through the
drive. BY ITS ABSENCE stalked the pace, raced three wide between near the quarter pole and gave way. CAPT. CANDY was away alert, chased two deep
early and gave way. MY LAST MISSION was getting out near the three eighths pole, dropped back near the quarter pole and tired.

CHUBLIN prompt the early leader from the outside, challenged through the far turn and was denied in a willing effort. TINA TINA TINA bobbled at the start,

break, raced four deep near the five sixteenths pole, angled out seven wide and finished with interest to bridge the gap. TRUE SUNSHINE stalked the pace,
raced from the outside around the far turn through the stretch and was even late with no closing run. MOMMA'S LINO broke in, bumped at the start, raced
two wide around the far turn and flattened out in the drive. CLUCK CLUCK dropped back off the early going, raced four to five wide and had no response.
FLOGE was off slowly, raced from the inside around the far turn, angled through the upper stretch and never threatened. CALL ANOTHER PLAY void of

MS. BUCCHERO sent along, cleared near the half mile pole, raced from the inside around the far turn though the stretch, came again in a resurgent run to
get up under strong pressure. WHISKEY AND RYE tracked the top pair three deep, made a three wide bid near the five sixteenths pole, led near the
sixteenth pole and lost the bob in a game effort. DECO STRONG lag back early, moved up four to five wide in the drive and closed in belatedly. SIMPLY
STATED showed good early speed to contend for the early lead in the early stages, taken back to rate along the rail and weakened. BENEATH THE
STARS was in three wide pursuit early and faded. FUHGEDDABOUDIT was off a step slow, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and never
threatened.
