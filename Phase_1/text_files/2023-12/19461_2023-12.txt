ONE MORE RING unhurried early, responded under mild right handed urging in upper stretch, circled rivals five wide and was along in time under a hand
ride. QUANTUM THEORY vied for the early lead four wide, rallied three wide through the turn to make the lead in upper stretch, shook clear before the
furlong marker then couldn't handle the winner. RIKIO settled close up three wide, shifted out to the five path entering the turn, offered a mild bid three wide
approaching the top of the stretch then was outfinished. FIVE STAR PHIL trailed down the backstretch then finished with good courage inside rivals. BOSS
BEAR was no factor. HOUSEBUILDER had good early speed along the inside and was through after a half. FRANK N DUCKY away alertly, set a pressured
pace to the top of the stretch then weakened. UPTOWN GUY chased the early pace two wide and faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
KACHOW broke in full stride to set all the pace and widened through the stretch under a strong hand ride to win as much the best. KATERYNA stalked the
pace down the backstretch, offered a mild bid in the four then three paths into the stretch and finished clear for second. NOT TODAY chased the winner
inside the runner up and was outfinished two wide. ANOINTED OF GOD saved ground past the quarter pole, drifted to the four path at the top of the stretch,
dropped back to the rail through mid stretch and finished evenly. LUNA PRIMAVERA well placed, had good early speed then faded. FREEDOM SAKE
trailed.
