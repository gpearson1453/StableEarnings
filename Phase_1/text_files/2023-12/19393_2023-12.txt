TATUM vied outside, shook loose midway on the turn and drew away through the stretch driving. CHASING STARDOM dueled winner along the inside,
weakened before half a mile but continued gamely for the place. RAISEDAROOFCHARLIE raced off the pace in the two path, angled out at the quarter pole
and finished willingly. CRACK THE CODE saved ground throughout and finished well in the stretch. LOTS OF MISCHIEF lacked speed wide and was never
in contention. MICROBEASTIE was well placed outside the dueling leaders early then gave way readily.

Footnotes
GOLDEN WILDCAT settled inside, advanced outside on the turn then drew away in the stretch while kept to his task. SKYHOOK vied outside to midstretch
and continued willingly to the finish. SHARP SENSATION well placed early, vied through the turn and weakened late. COWBOY JIM chased three wide off
the pace and lacked a solid rally. INSPECTOR chased off the pace four wide then flattened out in the stretch. BLUEY lacked speed saving ground then
went evenly through the stretch. KANE trailed far behind then passed fading rivals. STEVIE T was hampered by broken left stirrup leaving the chute causing
his rider to lose his irons and could not be properly handled. LYFE IS SIMPLE dueled along the inside for half a mile and stopped.

MY IMAGINATION raced off the pace inside, advanced two wide on the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, closed strongly outside and drew clear
late, driving. MORETHANAFEELING vied two wide for the early lead, then vied inside on the backside, dueled with FIRST MONEY on the far turn and into
the stretch, dug in gamely inside and yielded grudgingly to the winner. RUSH CENTER vied inside for the early lead, then tracked on the inside, chased on
the far turn, angled out, came wide into the stretch and rallied mildly for third. DANCE A DINI raced four wide on the first turn, stalked outside, chased four
wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. BIG BOYS ANSWER raced three wide early, steadied entering the clubhouse turn, then pulled between rivals,
chased three wide on the far turn, four wide past the quarter pole and closed belatedly. FIRST MONEY stalked close up three wide early, then vied two wide
on the backside, dueled on the far turn and tired in the final furlong. STEADY JOHN raced three wide off the pace and did not factor. TRAFFIC MASTER

OVERLY CRITICAL forced the pace in race long duel, edged ahead brushing with rival in midstretch then gradually extended margin following long drive.
TOPS THE CHART earned a narrow advantage inside, vied throughout, resisted the winner and finished gamely. A C EXPRESSWAY broke sluggishly,
rushed to contention outside, loomed a stretch threat but went evenly late. YES SIR COLONEL was reserved close up inside, angled out on the final turn
then flattened. HURRICANE HIGHWAY trailed far behind, moved closer into the stretch, loomed a threat then lacked a late kick. HEY PORTER saved
ground off the pace and gave way readily.
