Footnotes
WIN YA WIN settled off of the pace in the three path, fanned out to the five path entering the lane, rallied outside of the leaders while hanging on his left
lead through midstretch, lugged inwardly while offering a bid at the sixteenth pole, changed over and lead leaving that marker, then drove clear.
CRUSADER EXPRESS vied along the inside, was headed by his outer counterpart in upper stretch, yet kept while hanging on his left lead and regained
place from his outer counterpart late. RECKLESS RANSOM vied three to two wide approaching the turn, led leaving upper stretch but offered little
resistance to an outer challenge at the sixteenth pole, weakened and lost place late. BIBLEMAN pressed three wide but yielded leaving the quarter pole. J B
GRAY broke well, but lost action when put to tight rail quarters at the eleven sixteenths pole, dropped back quickly soon after, trailed along the inside into
the turn, then improved between horses in upper stretch. GREELEY WENT WEST prompted two wide and between the leading pair early on, but backed
out as his outer counterpart shifted across his path approaching the half mile pole, chased along the inside into the turn and faded. BUNKIE'S SONG broke
a step slow and was brushed by an inner rival at the start, then made little impact from the four path. SIR OVERANALYZE came out at the start then was
outrun in the two path.

OVER CALENDARED tracked two wide and between horses, lightly grazed an inner rival at the half mile pole, failed to sustain position among foes with
three furlongs to g, yet kept on among foes in the final furlong to improve position late. LORD DYLAN broke a bit outwardly, laid off of the pace in the three
to four path, then ran on in the six path while hanging on his left lead, moved up late but was outfinished for place. CARLOS PUNCH vied two wide, but was
bested by an outer bidder in upper stretch, tired through the final furlong and lost place to an outer pair late. GALLANT BUCK took light contact from rivals
on either side at the start, vied along the inside, vied for place while tiring through the final furlong, but lost a minor reward late. NEW DICE lacked speed
along the inside, ran on through the final furlong, but encountered traffic through the final sixteenth. CHEATIN CHARLIE stalked along the inside, took light
contact from an outer rival with a half mile to go, pursued from the two to three path around the turn, but lacked a bid and weakened between horses in the
final furlong. T J MUNNINGS leaned inwardly and was off a step slow, then was outrun two wide.

Footnotes
IZE SMILING set the pace in the two path, drew off entering the lane, shifted out in resentment of a left handed crop strike inside the furlong grounds and
was kept to task thereafter. KAZILLION lacked speed in the four path, fanned out to the seven path entering the lane, stayed on outside of rivals to bid for
place in the final sixteenth and edged that position nearing the wire. FREEFORM took contact from an outer rival at the start, stalked the top pair form the
four path, chased the clearing leader while vying for place through the lane, but was outfinished by an outer late bidder. GRAY PEARL saved ground off of
the pace, ran on to bid for place along the rail in midstretch, vied for that position into the final sixteenth but flattened out late. REQUESTFORPROPOSAL
broke a bit outwardly, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, retreated to trail approaching the five sixteenths pole, shifted out to the six path
and between horses in upper stretch, altered out after being outkicked and stayed on to improve position. GOTTAGONOWNOW pressed in the three path
and between horses, but yielded turning for home and weakened between horses while hanging on his left lead. PETTICOAT shifted in and bumped a rival
at the start, laid off of the pace in the three to two path, tipped to the five path in upper stretch and lacked a rally.

FORTUITY raced at the rear along the inside, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch, picked up stride after altering to the seven path nearing the final
sixteenth, surged up to the leading pair to offer a late bid and gained an advantage in the shadow of the wire. PLANE TALK was off half a beat slow, stalked
along the inside, bid through a vacated rail turning for home, vied with outer rivals while shifting out in upper stretch, sparred gamely while clinging to an
advantage into the final sixteenth, but was bested by an outer on-charging bidder nearing the wire. MISTER MMMMM stalked in the five path, bid into the
turn, vied with an inner foe into the final furlong, but was denied by that one before getting outkicked by an outer bidder for place late. TWIRLING ROSES
raced at the rear in the three path, shifted out to the seven path entering upper stretch and stayed on late for a minor share. MISTER CHAIRMAN stalked in
the four path and between horses, bid along with a outer rival into the turn, vied between horses turning for home and through upper stretch but gave way
leaving the furlong grounds. ROBO set a pressured pace in the two path into the turn, but yielded between horses turning for home. TOUGH CHARLIE vied
with an inner rival and from the three path, then between horses into the turn, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
CALIBRACHOA KID dueled for the lead with an inner rival and from the three path, led entering the lane in the four path and drove clear. SONO bumped an
outer rival at the start, settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path entering the lane, got floated to the seven path in midstretch and offered
a good kick in the final furlong to gain place late. PESO PESADO broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, saved ground while trailing, rallied along
the rail before tipping two wide in the final sixteenth, sustained progress to split rivals and offer a bid for place, but missed to an outer bidder. CHARCO
dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, chased that one into the lane then tired late. DREWMAZING tracked in the four path, chased in the five
path through midstretch but was outkicked for minor placings by bidders on both sides in the closing stages. ORDER UP bumped an inner rival at the start,
chased along the inside, shifted off the rail in upper stretch but lacked a bid and yielded. HOOSIER was bumped and bothered by an inner rival at the start,
then made little impact from the four path. CAJUN CONNECTION took light contact to his hind quarters from an inner rival at the start and was outrun in the
three path. HOLY BAYOU bounced off an outer rival before bumping an inner foe at the start, tracked in the three path and between horses, but weakened
after being floated out in upper stretch, was found to have bled and was vanned off.

SMILING ELLIE tracked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair entering upper stretch, kicked past those greenly-troubled rivals at the three
sixteenths pole, spurted clear in the process then held from pursuing foes late. CLEARLY COPPER bumped an outer rival at the start and was slow to
recover, settled well back in the two path, swung out to the six path entering the lane, rallied to vie for place as she closed in on the leader in the final
sixteenth, then prevailed for place while being fended off. MARSHAMARSHAMARSHA stalked the clear leader from multiple lengths off, ranged up around
the far turn to gain an advantage entering the lane, but greenly veered inwardly in upper stretch, struggled to change leads in the aftermath allowing for her
to be outkicked by an outer bidder at the three sixteenths pole, yet kept on well through the final furlong, vied for place with an outer foe in the late stages
but was bested. BLUE VORTEX saved ground pursuing from midpack, shifted out to the five path and between horses in midstretch, but only managed to
chase evenly. SIGNING cleared early on, met an outer challenge around the far turn, got headed by that one entering the lane, but was brushed and put to
crowded rail quarters by that one in upper stretch and gave way through the final furlong. DOOBLAY laid off of the pace in the four path chased around the
far turn and failed to menace. SAUCY SIX failed to factor from the three path. ENGLISH LUNA took firm contact from an inner rival and steadied between
horses at the start, raced at the rear along the inside and never got involved. JOCELYN tracked in the four to three path around the first turn, chased
between foes around the far turn and faded. SWEET MARIN hopped slightly and spotted the leaders multiple lengths at the start, trailed two wide and was
outrun.

BROUGHTY FERRY settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted out behind foes turning for home before drifting to the six path for clear sailing entering
the lane, rallied to bear down on the leaders in the final sixteenth and forged an advantage nearing the wire. FASTA LAVISTA BABY leaned outwardly at the
start, stalked along the inside, before gradually shifting outside of the leading pair around the far turn, pursued from within striking range along with an outer
rival nearing the lane, sustained stride to vie among foes into the final sixteenth but was outfinished by an outer bidder. UNION MIST tracked two wide,
pursued between horses down the backstretch, awaited racing room behind foes turning for home, chased in tight quarters through midstretch, sustained a
bid in the final sixteenth but missed. ANGEL OF FAITH prompted two wide, bid turning for home, forged an advantage in upper stretch, but was bested by
an outer trio of bidders in the closing stages. THORNY settled off of the pace in the four to three path, gained four wide around the far turn to be within
striking range entering the lane, sustained position through midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer foe entering the final sixteenth and caved in hand.
STARINA leaned inwardly at the start, tracked along the inside, got outmoved by outer rivals entering the lane and failed to menace. CHURNING BERNI
lacked speed in the two path, pursued in the four path and between horses around the far turn before floating to the seven path entering the lane, and failed
to factor. CONTROLLED TEMPER set the pace inside of a prompting rival, got headed by that one in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong.
STERLING LUCK bobbled then steadied hard to avoid crowded quarters between horses at the start, trailed in the the three to five path, got floated to the
eight path entering the lane and made little impact.

Footnotes
BEST PERFORMER tracked along the inside, smoothly bid for the lead two wide and between horses in upper stretch, spurted clear soon after, dug in to
resist a bold outer challenge entering the final sixteenth and gamely clung to an advantage to the finish. PAINT ME PERFECT settled off of the pace along
the inside, awaited racing room in the two path turning for home, split foes in the four path to launch a rally in upper stretch, quickly ranged up to the leader
entering the final sixteenth, sparred with that one through the closing stages but narrowly missed. SWEET ALYSSA lacked speed two wide and between
horses, shifted to the four path in upper stretch and rallied. SAKE (FR) lacked speed three to two wide, rallied in upper stretch, shifted to the four path to be
between horses in the final furlong and ran on. NOW YUS CANT LEAVE stalked two wide, took aim in the three path around the far turn, but was outkicked
by an inner rival in upper stretch, chased between horses into the final furlong and yielded. BEAUTIFULNAVIGATOR (IRE) tracked three wide but faded in
the five path in upper stretch. UNION DOLLY set the pace around both turns, but was bested at the three sixteenths pole and weakened. CLEVER JOKE
raced off of the pace while racing in the bit in the two to three path around the first turn, shifted four to five wide around the far turn before floating seven
wide in upper stretch and made little impact. LAST OF THE NILE leaned in at the start, pursued from midpack three to two wide around the first turn, then
four wide around the far turn before tipping six wide into upper stretch, and failed to factor. CATHERINE BLAZE was outrun along the inside.
