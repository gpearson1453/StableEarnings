SPOOKY ONE tracked the early leader from the outside two deep, raced four to five wide in the drive and finished well to surge up late under strong
pressure. BRIT'S CANDYMAN was sent to a clear early lead, remained clear inside the eighth but gave way to the winner grudgingly late. FEDERAL CASE
chased the pace from the inside and kept on willingly to the wire. BEYOND THE BEND lag early on to trail, raced near the inside around the far turn, was
three to four wide in the drive and closed in mildly. U U STAR dropped back off the early pace, raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a
bid.

ASH was off slowly, void of early speed, raced from the far outside in the stretch and closed in belatedly to narrowly secure the place position. KAZ
MUNNINGS stalked the pace, hard ridden three through the far turn and kept on willingly to the wire. MONEYONTHELINE raced mid pack early, was four to
five wide around the far turn and raced evenly no final bid. LARZ sprinted clear early on and faltered the final eighth of a mile. MILLBANK MAN raced with
the second flight, was four deep near the three sixteenths pole and needed more in the drive. DORSODURO chased the pace from the inside and faded.
LONG TOM unhurried early, swung six wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. COUSIN BOB saved ground and never threatened. MR

held safe late under a steady hand ride. LINDALOVESGOLD stalked the pace, raced two wide past the quarter pole, was four deep in the drive and closed
in slowly on the winner. RAW POWER rated back under a firm hold to race near the back, ridden through the far turn, raced four wide into the upper stretch
and was even late with no closing run on the top pair. CHARM ALARM was unhurried early on, moved up four wide through the far turn and lacked a closing
bid. WINGS OF A SONG stalked the pace from the inside and faded. WILL OR WON'T showed good early foot early and tired readily the final quarter of a

stretch, shifted in through the stretch run and had no final bid. ANNAMATED MOON chased the pace from the inside and faded. PER RULING FROM

deep, raced four wide nearing the eighth pole and kept on gamely to the wire. BOSS HOLIDAY sprinted clear from the outside, dug in nearing the eighth
pole and gave way late grudgingly. SPELLED WELL void of early speed, raced near the inside past the five sixteenths pole, eased out through the upper
lane and closed in mildly. WICKED IRISHMAN settled off the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch and had not
enough in the drive. HOLY CITY dropped back early, raced three to four wide in the drive and had no late rally. BRANTLEYS BIG GUN raced mid pack
early, swung six wide into the lane and lacked a solid bid. NOTORIOUS REY chased the early pace two deep and gave way.
