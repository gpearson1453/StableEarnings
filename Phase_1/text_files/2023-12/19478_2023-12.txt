Footnotes
RUN RUN RABBIT laid off of the pace along the inside, moved forward between horses nearing the lane, tipped to the five path for clear sailing entering
upper stretch, rallied while drifting inwardly through the lane, produced a late bid and forged an advantage at the wire. SANDRINHA LOVE raced forwardly
two wide and between horses, sustained pressure under rousing turning for home, bid entering the lane, cleared at the furlong grounds, but was collared
late and nailed at the wire. MISCHIEF JAC brushed the inner half of the gate upon leaving it, tracked along the inside, chased under urging into the turn,
shifted to the four path entering the lane, chased on his left lead as an outer rival ranged up alongside, but was herded inwardly by that bidding foe through
the final furlong and failed to offer a challenge. ANORIA pursued along the inside, tipped off the rail in midstretch and ran on. C C GRAND was bumped and
bothered by an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the five path despite urging into the turn, then stayed on for a minor share. LOVEYA LOVEYA
MORE took contact from an outer rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, but was headed by an outer presser entering the lane and gave way.
MISSY BEE broke inwardly and squarely bumped a foe at the start, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses into the turn, yielded in the three
path turning for home, yet kept on willingly thereafter. TEDDYISTRUCKING broke a step slow, lacked speed in the two path, shifted to the five path into the
lane, but drifted in while delaying a lead change in upper stretch and yielded between horses. GRACE AND FREEDOM trailed in the six to seven path and
improved position. BANDIT QUEEN stalked three wide and faded around the turn. SWEET GETAWAY leaned into the inner part of the gate, then made little
impact from the five path. HIGH SISU lunged inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the four path into the turn and tired.

Footnotes
MORNING ANGEL hopped slightly while off slow then steadied when an inner rival shifted across her path at the start, rated at the rear in the three to five
path, launched an advance approaching the far turn, sustained progress to take aim on the clear leader in the final furlong, ranged up to that one entering
the final sixteen than edged past. UNDER THE BED prompted inside of eventual pace setter around the first turn, stalked and shifted to the four path to be
outside of that one entering the backstretch, rebid at the half mile pole, edged ahead with three furlongs to go, cleared tucking to the three path turning for
home, maintained a clear margin into the final furlong, but flopped back to his left lead as an outer rival menaced entering the final sixteenth and was caught
late. LUCKY ANA advanced in the five to four path to vie outside of an inner rival around the first turn, led in the three path entering the backstretch, but was
headed by a her outer re-bidding counterpart at the three furlong pole, then chased the top pair through the lane to prove best of the rest. DEE DEE B broke
slowly, raced at the rear in the two to three path, moved out of last in the three to four path around the far turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane and
moved up. FLORIS leaned inwardly into open space at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted off the rail nearing the lane but gradually
gave way thereafter. DARTIGA tracked in the two path, chased in the three to four path and outside of rivals around the far turn, but weakened between
horses at the quarter pole. PRETTY HEART pursued from midpack in the four path and steadily gave way. STRONG DEMAND laid off of the pace in the
three path, took closer order between horses with five furlongs to go, but only managed to chase among foes around the far turn then faded. TEQUILA
EMPIRE broke outwardly, laid off of the pace along the inside, but faded into the far turn and was done early.

Footnotes
GREG'S HONOR pursued from midpack in the two path, inched closer to stalk around the far turn, took aim outside of the clear leader entering the lane, bid
in upper stretch, led into the final furlong and edged clear. CLEAR FOR ACTION set a clear pace in the three two path, met an outer challenge in upper
stretch, but was headed at the furlong pole and proved second best. JOB SECURITY laid off of the pace in the four path, inched closer in the three to four
path around the far turn, spun to the fie path entering the lane and ran on while one paced to secure show. INDOCUMENTADO had his hind heels clipped
be a trailing rival while shifting to the inside into the first turn, saved ground off of the pace around the turns, then moved up inside of rivals. JERICHO
EXPRESS stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the clear pace setter and to the three path nearing the backstretch, pressed under urging into the far
turn, but yielded in the four path and between horses entering the lane. COMMAND CENTRAL tracked in the two path into the first turn, tugged while floated
to the three path and between horses around that bend, but failed to sustain position down the backstretch, pursued off of the pace two wide and between
horses around the far turn and failed to factor. ELI laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses, steadied slightly among foes entering the
backstretch, but came under urging in the four to five path around the far turn and failed to menace. COUNTY COURT broke a step slow, then clipped the
hind heels of a rival shifting across his path into the first turn, raced at the rear in the two path and made little impact. NOT SO EASY lacked speed in the
four path, then in the five to six path around the far turn and never got involved. WIRE THE CASH was hustled forward early on, stalked in the three to four
path around the first turn but weakened between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
CRYSTAL SYMPHONY tracked in the two path, steadied and got shuffled behind rivals at the quarter pole, tucked for clear rail sailing entering the lane,
surged inside of rivals to spurt clear in upper stretch and drew off with good energy. TWO LUCYS chased forwardly in the three to four path, gained place
while chasing the clearing leader leaving the furlong pole, then shifted inwardly and held that position. CLASSY'N CONNECTED brushed with an outer rival
at the start, laid off of the pace in the five path and between horses, exchanged light contact with an outer gaining foe into the far turn, followed that one's
progress while shifting to the six path turning for home and stayed on to edge show. PAPAISICE brushed with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace
in the three path and between horses, stayed on by splitting foes at the furlong grounds, but was outfinished by an outer rival for show. YOU'RE KITTEN ME
was knocked off stride while exchanging firm contact with her hindquarters with an inner rival soon after the start, lacked speed in the two to three path,
gradually shifted out to the seven path in midstretch and moved up outside of horses. MIDNIGHT ANGEL broke a step slow then squarely bumped with an
outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the six path, gained in the five path around the turn, but flattened out and yielded between horses. OONDIRI
prompted along the inside, stalked around the turn, vacated the inner railing nearing the lane, then was outkicked by an inner bidder entering the lane and
gave way. SUCRE CECILE set the pace in the two path, but was bested by an inner bidder in upper stretch, delayed a lead change until the furlong grounds
and weakened between horses. SCARLET MISS made little impact along the inside. SILVER MAJESTY vied in the three path and weakened between
horses nearing the lane. SPAVINAW got rank at the start while breaking many lengths behind the rest, lagged behind around the turn and was outrun.
DIRTY FLIRT was done early.

MA RAE'S GIRL set the pace along the inside, drew off turning for home and held from a late bidder. FALABELLA pursued from midpack in the four path,
chased under urging among foes before fanning to the six path turning for home, yet sustained a rally in hopes of offering a late bid, but needed more.
CELTIC CHARM laid off of the pace in the two path, fanned out to the six path entering the lane, rallied between horses while shifting inwardly through
midstretch and gained show from an outer foe in the final sixteenth. STANDOUTSENSATION stalked along the inside, gained place shifted off the rail
entering the lane, but only managed to chase the clear leader before yielding between horses in the final sixteenth. PERFECTLY WICKED settled well back
in the three path, then in the four to five path around the far turn before being floated to the seven path nearing the lane and ran on willingly. POUNCE laid
off of the pace in the five path, inched closer under urging in the four path around the far turn but lacked a bid between horses. GIGI'S WORLD broke
awkwardly, lacked speed along the inside, shifted out before getting floated from the five to eight path nearing the lane and surpassed tired rivals.
RIPERTON prompted outside of the eventual winner, but yielded turning for home and weakened between horses. MILA JUNES broke slowly, saved
ground at the rear, was blocked behind rivals nearing the lane and failed to menace along the inside. KENWICK pursued from midpack along the inside and
faded. CAT'S CAVE stalked three wide, chased between horses around the far turn and weakened entering the lane. ANNA'S WISH tracked two wide and
between horses then weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY HOUSE vied two wide, led as an outer rival pressed at the quarter pole, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, leaned inwardly brushing an
inner bidder into another rival inside the furlong grounds, straightened course nearing the final sixteenth and held firm. ONE LUCKY DAY chased in the
three two to path into the turn, took aim between the leading pair entering upper stretch, inched between them nearing the furlong grounds, but was bumped
the outer leader into their inner counterpart while put to tight quarters inside the final furlong, then was fended off through the final sixteenth. CATIPARI laid
off of the pace in the four to six path, then stayed on in the final furlong to miss reaching place. HASTINGS SUNRISE stalked three wide, pressed around
the turn, but failed to keep pace in the four path in upper stretch, sustained a chase while hanging on his left lead, but yielded between horses late.
RANGER FOX broke poorly, recovered leaving the chute, laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses around the turn, shifted to the five path
entering the lane and ran on evenly. ENGLISH TIDE set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed by that one while inside of pair of foes at the quarter
pole, but was bumped and put to tight quarters inside the final furlong, steadied and gave way. MIDWAY MIRACLE was off slowly and showed little. RUN
RUN RAPIDASH chased along the inside and weakened. FOLLOWING RIDER'S OBJECTIONS OF ENGLISH TIDE AGAINST ONE LUCKY DAY AND
ONE LUCKY DAY AGAINST HOLIDAY HOUSE, BOTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH; HOLIDAY HOUSE WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED
SIXTH.

Footnotes
ELIZA'S HONOR was allowed to settle at the rear along the inside, quickened shifting off the rail passing the three furlong pole, ranged up to offer a bold bid
outside of the leaders entering the lane, drew away under moderate urging and was put to hand late. SHOSHA tracked two wide and between horses,
ranged up four wide around the far turn to forged an advantage at the quarter pole, but quickly proved no match for an outer bidder entering the lane and
was second best. BIG HELLO raced at the rear in the two path, shifted out to the five path entering the lane and stayed on to edge show at the sixteenth
pole. CITY OF GOD chased along the inside, then lacked a bid before prevailing for fourth. FAST FELIX prompted three wide, but was swiftly outmoved by
an outer pair nearing the lane, vied with an outer foe for show through midstretch but yielded between horses late. FOR MAMA prompted inside of the pace
setter, vied with an outer pair approaching the far turn, but offered no resistance to an outer pair of bidders turning for home and weakened between horses
in upper stretch. THISPOINTINTIME was briefly taken a hold of early on, settled off of the pace in the three path and between horses, saved ground around
the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. SUBURBAN PRINCE bumped with an outer rival at the start, chased three wide and faded
into the far turn. MR CREED made little impact from the four path. CAMBIASO lacked speed in the five path, fanned out to the seven path turning for home
and was outrun. WEST ISLAND was fractious and dropped his rider leaving the paddock, then lacked speed in the two path, then in the four to five path
around the far turn, shied from an inner rival in upper stretch and was eased through the final furlong. LEO'S ROAR bumped with an inner rival at the start,
set the pace between a prompting foe on either side, proved no match for an outer bidding pair nearing the lane and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
UP AND DOWN pursued from midpack along the inside, swung out to the six path in upper stretch, rallied to offer a bid outside of the leaders in the closing
stages and got up at the wire. RECINTO ROMPERE tracked from the two path, shifted outside of the leaders and to the five path entering the lane,
sustained a grinding charge to bid at the sixteenth pole, vied through the late stages but was outfinished by an outer bidder. NURSEKRINGLEDANCES vied
two wide and between horses, then inside of rivals entering the lane, battled gamely through the final furlong but was caught late. HURRICANE DEBBIE
vied three wide, then between horses turning for home, sustained the long battle among foes through the lane but was bested late. LIAM'S CHAMP lacked
speed in the four path and between horses, altered course outwardly in the final furlong and rallied. PROUD MARY laid off of the pace in the three to two
path, shifted out passing the furlong ground and ran on. UP TO SOMETHING lacked speed along the inside and made little impact. CAT ROYALE was slow
into stride, trailed in the six to seven path and moved up late. LA V. stalked four wide, bid turning for home, but yielded between horses in upper stretch.
SPARKLE OF HOPE failed to factor from the five path. DULCIA vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals and weakened with a quarter mile to go.
WEATHER MAP chased from midpack in the three path but faded while drifting to the six path entering the lane.

Footnotes
DAZZLIN' DICTATOR broke a step slow and was forced to bump with an outer rival at the start, settled well back in the three path, gained ground in the five
path around the far turn, sustained rally to bid approaching the furlong grounds and drove clear. JANEY CREED steadied when pinched between horses at
the start, trailed, gained six wide and outside of foes approaching the far turn, progressed to bid four wide passing the three furlong pole, led entering the
lane, met an outer challenge in upper stretch but was bested in the final furlong. STEPHANIESWARRIOR lacked speed in the two path, chased along the
inside around the far turn, shifted out between horses in upper stretch, ran on and prevailed for show from an outer bidder. REMEMBERING was a bit
restless awaiting the start, tracked two wide and between horses chased among foes around the far turn, shfited out entering the final furlong and stayed on
to miss reaching show. SHE'S ARODEOQUEEN pursued from midpack along the inside, but steadied between foes and got shuffled back behind a faltering
foe at the three furlong pole, yet sustained a rail grind through the lane. LYRICAL PARDON stalked along the inside, vied around the far turn, but yielded in
midstretch and faded between horses. TAKETHESILVER laid off of the pace two to three wide, chased in the four path and between horses around the far
turn and gave way. ENDURING stalked two wide, vied between horses around the far turn and weakened entering the lane. BETHSHEBA laid off of the
pace along the inside and failed to factor. NOTO broke a bit outwardly, pursued from midpack two wide, retreated down the backstretch, raced off of the
pace in the four path around the far turn and made little impact. BERNAR MOSA tracked three wide, vied between horses around the far turn and weakened
nearing the lane. THE ENEMY OF FUN broke inwardly before being hustled to the front, showed the way with a clear margin in the three to two path, but
wilted between horses at the three furlong pole.
