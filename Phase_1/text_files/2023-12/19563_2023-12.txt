Footnotes
AUTIE vied two wide, then between horses turning for home, led entering the lane, inched clear and held sway from a pursuer through the final furlong.
WISH CAREFULLY popped open the gate pre-race without leaving it, tracked the leading trio from the two path turning for home, took aim three wide and
between horses in upper stretch, then chased the clearing leader well through the final furlong to prove second best. RAZOR CREST broke a step slow, laid
off of the pace along the inside and moved up. ACHROMEDOUTCAT set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed by that one and an outer bidder
nearing the lane and faded entering the final furlong. BLAME ME SERIOUSLY raced at the rear in the two path, trailed by an open margin turning for home,
then improved position. REGATTA BAY lacked speed along the inside and failed to factor. BRITTANY'S DREAM stalked three wide, ranged up to bid at the
five sixteenths pole, but drifted to the four path entering the lane and weakened. HENNESSY WILD bumped the outer part of the gate while spotting the rest
of the field multiple lengths at the start, raced at the rear in the three path, swung out to the six path entering the lane and made little impact. KICKIN CHIP
lacked speed two wide and tired on his left lead.

Footnotes
ETHAN ENERGY brushed with an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace shifting out from the three to four path to be outside of foes around the first
turn, complied when roused to range up outside of the leading trio around the far turn, bid entering the lane and drew off under a drive approaching
midstretch. EL MAGNIFICO pressed two wide and from the three path, bid in the two path into the far turn, forged a short advantage with three furlongs to
go, but offered little resistance to an outer challenge in upper stretch then gamely fended off an outer bidder for place. PHANTOM SPEED tracked the top
pair from the four path, pursued them along with an outer rival and from the three path around the far turn, but was outkicked by his outer counterpart
entering the lane, kept on to vie for place entering the final furlong, but was kept at bay. RULEROFTHEUNIVERSE stalked along the inside, got outmoved
by an outer bidder while biding time behind the leaders turning for home, encountered more traffic two wide and between horses in upper stretch, then ran
on but failed to threaten. KISSTHEMOON saved ground at the rear, shifted out to the four path inside of SAN SIRO entering the lane, exchanged brushes
with that one through the stretch and failed to menace. POPWEISER set a pressured pace in the two path, got headed tucking to the rail entering the far
turn, then weakened in upper stretch. SAN SIRO brushed with an inner rival leaving the gates, lacked speed in the four to five path, exchanged contact with
an inner rival through the lane and failed to factor. CATHY'S BOY leaned inwardly and brushed the gate upon leaving it, laid off of the pace along the inside,
but faded between horses under urging around the far turn.

Footnotes
LOVELY PRINCESS tracked from the two path, loomed with run while waiting for racing room behind the leaders nearing the lane, found clear rail sailing in
upper stretch, spurted clear before meeting an outer challenge passing the furlong grounds, dueled with that bidder through the late stages and narrowly
held. CREATIVE CAIRO settled off of the pace along the inside, moved off the rail entering the backstretch, crept closer in the three path around the far
turn, launched a rally swinging to the six path entering the lane, produced a good kick to bid outside of the clear leader passing the furlong grounds, dueled
through the late stages but just missed. JOIN THE DANCE raced at the rear in the two path, trailed entering the backstretch and around the far turn, altered
course out to the seven path in upper stretch and rallied to gain show at the sixteenth pole. DANA'S BEAUTY broke through the gate pre-race, set the pace
in the two path, led from bidders turning for home, but shifted to the three path entering the lane before being headed by an inner bidder in upper stretch,
then drifted out and yielded between horses soon after. TASWEYA pressed the leader from the three path, then between horses turning for home, floated to
the four path entering the lane and gave way among foes. YANKEE DOLLAR stalked the top pair from the four path, crept closer to striking range nearing
the lane, but weakened in the five path and between horses at the quarter pole. COLORS OF THE WIND stalked along the inside, inched forward to press
inside of the leader down the backstretch, but failed to sustain a bid entering the far turn, chased around that bend and weakened.

Footnotes
LEGALIZE vied three deep while in the four path around the turn, wrestled an advantage in upper stretch, flopped back to his left lead while inching a
margin passing the furlong grounds, drifted out subtly while changing back to his right lead entering the finial sixteenth and drove clear. AMERICAN
RASCAL stalked the leading trio from the five path around the turn, inched closer turning for home, then chased willingly through the lane and edged place
whlie pursuing the clearing leader in the final sixteenth. AGOO vied for the lead in the three path and between a pair of rivals around the turn, but failed to
keep pace with his outer counterpart in midstretch, yielded and lost show in the final sixteenth. THE DONEGAL CLAN broke a bit outwardly, raced off of the
pace in the two path, tracked in the three path around the turn, lacked progress while hanging on his left lead through upper stretch, drifted from the two to
four path in midstretch, changed over and ran on while one-paced. TRIPLE TREA rushed forward to vie for the lead with a pair of outer rivals while
remaining a path off of the inner railing, got headed by those counterparts in upper stretch and gave way. MALIBU RAIN chased from off of the pace along
the inside and was outrun.

Footnotes
MOSAICO MAN settled off of the pace in the three path, inched closer in the four path around the far turn, took bumps from an inner room-searching rival
while holding his path at the three sixteenths pole, sustained progress to bid at the furlong grounds, sparred with an inner rival while shifting ground inwardly
thereafter and wrestled an advantage late. FUNNYFLAME pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, led in the three path at the quarter pole, dug in to
resist an outer challenge at the furlong grounds, dueled gamely with that bidder through the late stages but was narrowly bested. DIMATIC laid off of the
pace two wide and between horses, launched rally among foes entering the lane, attempted a bid inside of the leader at the furlong grounds, but only
managed to chase the top pair home. JUSTIFREAK transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, tracked two wide and between
horses, bumped an outer foe while shifting to the four path at the three sixteenths pole, but failed to find clear sailing between horses by doing so and gave
way. KING ANTHONY lacked speed in the three to two path and moved up between horses. GOOD LORD broke out and bumped a rival at the start, set the
pace along the inside, vied with an outer presser around the far turn, got headed by that one entering the lane and weakened. BISATE stalked three wide,
chased between horses around the far turn and faded. ICE WOLF raced at the rear in the four to three path around the turns, shifted out entering the lane
and made little impact. BOURBON'S FAULT broke a step slow before being bumped by an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside,
crept closer under moderate restraint to stalk with five furlongs to go, but chased around the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
LE GRIS broke a bit outwardly, settled well back in the two path, inched closer to track around the far turn, shifted to the six path entering the lane, rallied to
bid outside of the new leader passing the furlong grounds, dueled with that one through the late stages and edged ahead. OCEAN VICTORY laid off of the
pace in the three path, progressed between horses turning for home, tipped four wide to take aim entering the lane, bid and forged an advantage at the
three sixteenths pole, dug in to resist an outer challenge leaving the furlong ground, dueled thereafter but was bested late. CABERNAYDO lacked speed in
the two to three path, swung out to the eight path entering the lane and rallied to gain show at the sixteenth pole. SUGAR HOOK pursued from midpack in
the two path before tucking to the inside, then ran on between horses. SIR EXTON vied three wide, but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the three
sixteenths pole, then yielded between horses entering the final sixteenth. COUNT DRACULA stalked along the inside, got subtly shuffled behind the leaders
nearing the lane, shfited out to the three to four path in upper stretch, chased then faded. DOUBLE NEAT set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals and
yielded through the lane. GREERS FERRY vied two wide and between horses but faded in upper stretch. EMPIRE'S CLASSIC tracked in the three to four
path, but was floated to the seven path and between horses entering the lane and tired. WITHOUT EQUAL lacked speed along the inside and made little
impact. CESNOLA broke a step slow, then was bumped and faltered between horses soon after the start, and never got involved. BAYOU MAGIC bumped
the gate upon leaving it and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LESLIE'S LOOT broke a bit outwardly, sparred for the lead three deep, led into the turn before drawing clear and tucking to the two path approaching the
five sixteenths pole, then held sway under a drive through the lane. HALINA'S FORTE stalked the leading trio from the three path and inside of a rival into
the turn, inched closer between horses at the five sixteenths pole, got outmoved by her outer counterpart entering the lane, yet chased well thereafter, vied
for place with an outer rival entering the final sixteenth, brushed that one in the late stages and prevailed. DEBOISBLANC brushed with an inner rival at the
start, raced off of the pace tucking from the five to two path into the turn, picked up stride tipped three to five wide turning for home, then ran on to bid for
place in the final sixteenth but was kept at bay. TWIRL AROUND took contact to her hind quarters from an inner rival at the start, stalked in the four path,
inched closer to striking range entering the lane, but only managed to chase the clear leader through midstretch, was brushed by an inner rival while losing
place to that one in the final sixteenth and yielded between horses late. KANT RESIST IT dueled for the lead with a pair of outer rivals, chased her widest
counterpart around the turn and faded. BRUNCH PUNCH brushed with an outer rival upon leaving the gates, dueled for the lead two wide and between
horses, chased her outer clearing counterpart around the turn and weakened. BEDOWNTOFOOLAROUND broke slowly, leaned outward and bumped an
outer rival at the start, trailed throughout and was outrun.

JUST MIGHT vied two wide, cleared entering the turn, opened up entering the lane, maintained wide margin while beginning to tire in the final furlong, yet
lasted well late. SOSUA SUMMER lacked speed in the three path, swung out to the seven path entering the lane and rallied to gain place late. MINNESOTA
READY laid off of the pace in the four path, entered the lane in the six path, rallied to bid for place along with an outer rival in the final sixteenth, sparred
between horses thereafter but was outfinished. SWIFT AS I AM pursued from midpack in the two path, then stayed on to duel for place with outer bidders in
the final sixteenth, but missed. EVAN SING brushed the gate while breaking a bit slow, trailed along the inside, shifted out to the eight path entering the final
furlong and moved up. HIGH LIMIT ROOM broke outwardly, tugged forward to track in the three path into the turn, gained place in upper stretch, but yielded
between horses at the sixteenth pole. KAVOD broke inwardly, raced off of the pace in the three path and between horses, then failed to factor. BUSHIDO
tracked in the two path, vied for place with an outer rival turning for home, but weakened while hanging on his left lead through the lane. BODENHEIMER
vied inside of the eventual winner early on, chased that clearing foe into the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
ALPINE PRINCESS bobbled outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, pulled herself forward inside of rivals to reach the fore entering the first turn, dictated
terms as an outer rival applied mild pressure, shook clear of that one while well in hand turning for home, inched further away once set down in upper
stretch, came under a drive as her stablemate gave chase in the final furlong and held sway. WEST OMAHA tracked three wide, came under urging in
pursuit around the far turn, floated four wide entering the lane, then ran on well, flopped back to her left lead while closing in on her clear stablemate
entering the final sixteenth and finished up second best with good energy. SISTINA CHAPEL took contact from an inner rival and brushed with an outer foe
at the start, trailed along the inside, rallied up the rail while hanging on her left lead to gain show approaching midstretch, but leveled off in the final furlong.
LEGADEMA stalked two wide, chased the well-traveling leader while under urging around the far turn, failed to keep pace turning for home, got floated to
the three path entering the lane and faded between horses. BAND OF GOLD transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, pursued
from midpack tucking from the two path to the inside around the first turn, crept closer and tipped to the two path to bid for place inside of rivals at the
quarter pole, but failed to change leads and weakened in upper stretch. FIBBER brushed with an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the three to
four path and faded turning for home.

Footnotes
TWO EMMYS vied two wide, led in the two path down the backstretch, opened up to a wide margin in upper stretch and lasted safely. BEATBOX broke
slowly and shifted inwardly at the start, saved ground off of the pace, steadied to avoid a pulling-up foe at the five furlongs pole, moved forward two wide
and between horses turning for home rallied among foes in upper stretch, tipped four wide at the furlong grounds, sustained progress to take aim on the
clear leader in the final sixteenth but needed more to reel that one in. ENGLISH TAVERN tracked two wide, then along the inside down the backstretch,
chased under urging around the far turn, yet kept on to vie for place approaching midstretch, shifted out inside the furlong grounds while meeting an outer
challenge for that position, but was bested in the final sixteenth and held show. JOHNY'S FIREBALL settled well back three wide, swung out to the seven
path entering the lane, rallied before leveling off in the final furlong and missed reaching show. PROTONIC POWER raced at the rear in the two path,
encountered traffic in the three path in upper stretch, moved forward altering course to knife through rivals at the furlongs grounds, rallied between horses in
the late stages but needed more to gain show. HARLAN ESTATE raced at the rear in the three path, fanned out to the eight path in upper stretch and
moved up. FAIR DINKUM took contact from an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace two to three wide before shifting to the six path entering the lane,
but failed to factor between horses. LAW PROFESSOR stalked three wide, pressed the leader from the three path around the far turn, but folded between
horses in the final furlong. RISING EMPIRE pursued from the four path, took closer order to stalk into the far turn, but entered the lane in the five path and
weakened between horses while hanging on his left lead. STREET READY pursued from the three path and between horses, then weakened among foes
through the lane. DUKE OF CARTHANIA leaned in and bumped a foe at the start, stalked along the inside, but steadied behind the leader at the three
quarter pole, checked in a firmer manner entering the backstretch, pursued from midpack around the far turn, then lost his rider at the furlong grounds.
SONNY SMACK vied along the inside, but was headed at the three quarter pole, then was pulled up with five furlongs remaining and was vanned off.

Footnotes
FIVE STAR GENERAL stalked two wide, gained an advantage with eleven sixteenths to go, showed the way in the two path around the far turn, shook free
before inching clear entering the lane and held sway well through the final furlong. PIONEER OF MEDINA bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked
three wide, vied for place in pursuit of the clearing leader in upper stretch, gained that position as an outer rival bid for it in midstretch and gamely turned
that one away in the late stages. HAPPY AMERICAN broke a step slow, trailed in the three path, circled rivals with a five wide rally around the far turn,
sustained progress to bid for place at the furlong grounds, but leveled off and was kept at bay. BRIGADIER GENERAL bumped with an inner rival upon
leaving the gates, set the pace as an outer rival applied pressure, got headed by that one with eleven sixteenths to go, sustained inside position into the far
turn, but chased his clearing counterpart turning for home and gave way. CONFIDENCE GAME pursued from midpack in the two path, then between horses
down the backstretch, but lost position and retreated to trail in the three path at the five sixteenths pole, yet ran on through the lane to regain a minor
reward. STAGE RAIDER raced off of the pace in the four path before tucking to the inside with over five furlongs to go, then failed to menace. DASH
ATTACK laid off of the pace along the inside while a path off of the rail, took closer order to track from midpack at the five furlong pole, but chased from the
three path turning for home then failed to factor. MBAGNICK (CHI) pursued from midpack in the three to four path and faded.

TRACK PHANTOM vied two wide, drew clear of his inner counterpart in the three path at the three furlong pole and held sway from a pair of pursuers
through the final furlong. SNEAD settled off of the pace in the three path, gained in the five path and outside of foes around the far turn, bid for place
entering the lane, vied for that position while chasing the clear leader into the final furlong, edged place late and ran on to narrow the leader's gap. NASH
tracked two wide and between horses around the opening bend, tipped out to the four path at the five furlong pole, ranged up to take aim on the leader
around the far turn, but failed to offer a bid nearing the lane, delayed a lead change as an outer rival bid for place passing the quarter pole, lacked progress
after changing leads at the three sixteenths marker, then yielded place in the late stages. FOOTPRINT stumbled at the start, trailed along the inside, shifted
to the three path to avoid tiring rivals at the five sixteenths pole, improved between horses entering the lane and ran on willingly. RISK IT transferred contact
from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, tracked along the inside, tossed his head momentarily approaching the seven furlong pole before pulling
under firm restraint entering the backstretch, stalked behind the leading pair approaching the far turn, but was shuffled behind a faltering foe around the far
turn and faded. NEAT took light contact from an inner rival at the tart, tracked in the four path, but failed to sustain position and faded down the backstretch,
fanned to the six path while towards the rear entering the lane and made little impact. NEXT LEVEL broke outwardly and brushed a foe at the start before
being hustled forward to vie for the lead inside of the eventual winner around the first turn, but weakened with three furlongs to go and stopped.
