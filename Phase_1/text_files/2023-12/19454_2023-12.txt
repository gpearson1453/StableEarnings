ACADEMY CHOICE brushed with an outer foe at the start, rated inside, shifted out under coaxing around the turn, floated to the seven path entering the
lane, and rallied just in time to get up on the wire. MEXICOFFEE broke out at the start, set the pace in the two path, was challenged rounding the turn, dug
in to fend off that challenger in the three path down the stretch, but was nailed at the wire by a late charging outer foe to placed. GABAGOOL prompted the
pace in the four path, bid in the three path rounding the turn, kept on in the four path down the lane, but hung and was out-finished on both sides late to
show. PAYNTED BLUE hopped then bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace while shifting out to the five path in the opening furlong,
floated out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and mildly stayed on. BLUE SOLDIER stalked in the two path, was roused in the three path passing the
three-eighths, but flattened down the lane. THE COMPAS MAN (IRE) brushed with an inner foe at the start, tracked inside, but had to check going into the
turn, and did not threaten. LEO FONG bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced wellback and was herded out to the center in the opening furlong, shifted
into the two path going into the turn, but could not threaten from the six path in the stretch. ADIOS YOUR HONOR chased in the three path but never
menaced.

Footnotes
FOR SOME REASON was bumped at the start, stalked the pace in the three path, took over in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and drew
off under a drive. HAY HAY HARRY chased the pace inside, could not keep pace around the turn, angled three wide near the quarter pole and rallied for the
place. GRAN ROQUE was bumped soon after the start, sped to the front, set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened.
BUILDER JAK was off a step slow, saved ground and never threatened. DECISIVE WARRIOR bobbled at the start, raced three wide and passed tiring
rivals. MR. LEFTY played no factor while racing four and five wide. TIZAFASTBULLET bumped with the winner at the start, chased the pace two wide,
angled four wide near the quarter pole and came up empty in the lane. WINWOOD bumped soon after the start, raced three wide and was done early.

ABRUMAR saved ground in range, angled out in midstretch and was up late. PARIS SURPRISE set a pressured pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper
stretch and led until deep stretch. INHERENT PROMISE steadied along while racing two wide in midpack around the first turn, angled out early on the
backstretch, was bumped near the half-mile pole, bid four deep rounding the far turn, could not quite match strides in upper stretch but kept on to hold the
show. I SEE YOU LOOKIN saved ground off the pace, swung five wide near the quarter pole, rallied outside and just missed third. OCALA ROCKET dueled
two wide to upper stretch and weakened. MO CALIENTE settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced between foes down the backstretch,
bid three wide between nearing the five-sixteenths marker but faded through the stretch. SIMSOUM broke sharply, was wrangled back in the two path,
chased two wide under a firm hold, steadied again near the quarter pole, angled out near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. AMAZING JETT hit
the starting gate, raced off the pace three wide, came in and bumped a foe near the half-mile pole, continued three wide around the far turn and was never a
threat. TEAM TRAVIS played no factor while racing two wide. SWISS SLANG trailed inside.

Footnotes
SABIAN set the pace in the two path, was roused into the turn, and kicked away while still in the two path down the stretch under a drive. HERMOSO
HOMBRE tracked in the three path, waited between foes rounding the turn, was roused from the four path into the lane, and ran on for place. PACK PLAYS
stalked in the five path, bumped with an inner foe while under a ride in the five path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. LIGHTING CLOUDS rated in the
two path, had to steady going into the turn, was driven from the rail into the stretch, but flattened. RYE'S MY GUY bumped with an outer foe at the start,
trailed in the three path early and never factored. MAYHEMINTHEPALACE broke out at the start, raced off the pace in the four path and never threatened
from the seven path in the stretch. MCVICKER bumped with an inner foe at the start, pressed in the four path, bid in the three path around the turn, bumped
with an outer foe while in the four path in upper stretch, and weakened.

Footnotes
MACANGA set a rated pace inside, shook clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. CREVALLE D'ORO saved ground off the early, advanced four
wide around the far turn, fanned wider turning for home and rallied outside to gain the place late. PENDULUM settled off the pace while racing two and three
wide, made a bid in upper stretch, moved into second leaving the eighth pole but was outkicked late. MAMA BELLA raced off the pace two wide, steadied
while getting out a bit early on the first turn, made some progress three wide around the far turn and rallied through the lane for a minor slice. THIS
COUNTRY stalked the pace from the rail and faded in the lane. PUBLIC DEFENDER tracked the pace three and four wide and weakened in the stretch.
ROSCOE VILLAGE prompted the winner two wide and tired in the stretch. FIORENZA saved ground off the pace early, went five wide around the far turn
and never threatened. TWISTED ROMANCE chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. ROYAL ASCOT hesitated at the start, raced well
back two and three wide, lugged in in the stretch and was never involved. FOREVER MIA lunged at the start, was forced out early on the first turn, was
always near the rear, saved ground around the far turn an lacked a closing bid. BIG DREAMER had brief speed two wide.

SOGNO DI CAMPIONE (CHI) pressed the pace three wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, drifted out in the stretch and dug in when the
runner-up reached even terms leaving the eighth pole and was edged back ahead late. GAME BOY BENNY stalked the pace four wide, bid outside of the
winner and was turned back late. SENSEI LAWRENCE vied inside early, chased inside around the turn and held well enough to preserve the show.
FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP vied in the two path for a half and faded. DIAMOND COOL chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. DOUBLE PLAY
KING failed to menace while racing four wide. RAGTIME BLUES played no factor while racing five wide. CAJUN HOPE had only brief speed inside.

Footnotes
HOT N LUCKY broke out at the start, laid up close in the three path, bid in the two path midway around the far turn, swept to the lead at the top of the
stretch, kicked away, and was wrapped up late. PAPALOTE set the pace inside, was challenged approaching the quarter, lost the lead at the top of the lane,
drifted out through the final furlong, and held place. NO PLEBEIAN raced off the pace in the four path, received right handed cues rounding the far turn, but
was stymied passing the quarter, altered in to the three path entering the stretch, and kept on for show. PRAISEWORTHY broke in at the start, rated in the
four path, was ridden in the five path around the far turn, swung from the six path into the stretch, but finished evenly. SWEET TRAVELS bumped with an
outer foe at the start, trailed in the five path early, was roused in the six path midway around the far turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the
stretch, but made no impact. MY GREAT ILLUSION bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the two path, had to steady passing the quarter, and
flattened. WE GOT THIS bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked inside was coaxed from the rail into the far turn, tipped out to the three path at the
top of the lane, but faded. TIGGEROO raced wellback in the two path early and did not factor. MAYOR JACK raced in midpack in the four path but was tired
turning into the stretch. T B TWELVE ALWAYS bumped with an inner foe at the start, was hustled off the pace in the two path down the backstretch, driven
from the rail into the lane, but weakened. FIRST COAST STORM was steadied along around the first turn, raced near the back of the field along the inside
and never menaced. BREEZE THE BAYOU broke slow, stalked in the five path but was fading while having to steady passing the quarter.
