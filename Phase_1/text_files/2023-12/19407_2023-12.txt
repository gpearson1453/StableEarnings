Footnotes
MIDNIGHT CROWN raced within striking distance, steadied around the second turn, lacked running room, dropped back, came again on the inside, split
rivals down the stretch and drove clear, proving much the best. IDE LIKE HAWAII pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, moved up on the inside,
proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. SOULOLOGY raced within striking distance, came around the second turn four wide, took the lead,
was no match for the winner, and got caught for second. CHIEF KIMOSABI raced near the middle of the field, made a late bid and lacked enough late.
TOOCAN DANCE broke out, raced near the back, showed late interest, but was no factor. MY MY LIMIT raced within contention, came around the first turn
on the outside and faded. ADMIRAL AFLEET squeezed back at the start, racing in the rear, came around the final turn five wide and was never a threat.
ANGOLA VACATION dueled for the early lead, saved ground and was finished early. CATINANDSCATIN vied for the early advantage and dropped back. K
V TARGET void of early speed, raced outside around the first turn and showed little.

BOYFRIEND MATERIAL sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won handily. DOUBLE THUNDER void of early speed, came around the
second turn seven wide, rallied and was a clear second. AMERICAIN JOEY raced within contention, was close throughout and proved no match for the top
two. MR. B CAUSE raced within striking distance, made a mild bid and hung late. TAPPIN FORA DANCE raced in the middle of the field and put forth an
even effort. LOUIS LE GRANDE raced near the back, came around the first turn five wide, put forth an even effort and was never a factor. HERZEN raced
evenly near the back and was never a threat. BODE'S LIGHT raced in the middle of the pack, faded, finished wide and was outrun. HARDCORE
FOLKLORE always raced near the back and showed little. BIG MONEY MACHINE pressed the early pace and retreated to the rear.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT TRIP raced within striking distance, made a late bid, split rivals down the stretch and got up late. BRI pressed the pace, raced close throughout,
made a bid down the home stretch, drove clear, but couldn't hold off MIDNIGHT TRIP for the win. CAJUN ACES vied for the early lead, challenged on the
front end throughout and was outfinshed by the top two. ANN'S STORM raced in the middle of the field, moved up on the outside around the second turn
and finished evenly. EMMAS RULER lacked early speed, improved position, finished wide and was no factor. LACIS JEWEL void of early speed and was
never a threat. LONESHILOHSPECIAL dueled on the front end, drove clear, saved ground and retreated. GLORY TO ME reserved in the beginning, moved
to the rail, saved ground throughout, faded and was no threat late.

TARGET PRACTICE went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task. MEAN CRUISER lacked early speed, gained ground late and
got up for second. OUTLAW X. raced near the middle of the field, came around the final turn on the outside, made a late bid and missed second. MY BOOK
raced within striking distance, saved ground and lacked a late kick. FULL POWER pressed pace, raced outside around the first turn and faded. PRAY IDE
SING was an early factor, dropped back and was no threat late. GOTTATAKEHIMTO void of early speed, came around the final turn on the outside and was
never close.
