Footnotes
MUSKOKA SUMMER was allowed to settle trailing the pack down the backside, saved ground seeing the field around the turn, swung out widest in the
seven path gaining momentum at the top of the lane and wore down the leaders through the entire stretch to just hold in a tight photo for the win. SWIRLING
DANCER pressed the pace inside down the back straight, offered only mild pressure on the fence throughout the turn, never gave in down the stretch,
determinedly surged inside at the furlong pole and just missed timing the nod at the wire for the win. BIG GINGER had a slim advantage outside down the
backstretch, opened up slightly on the chasing rival to her inside through the turn, stubbornly fought on down the stretch clinging to the lead and gave way
grudgingly with runners on each side in the final few jumps before the wire to hold for third money. VERY SAVVY had one foe beaten down the backside,
made little headway outside of horses through the turn, angled out to be in the six path in upper stretch and finished up mildly to the wire to settle on the
fringes. TAYLORMOON stalked near the rear on the inside down the back straight, rallied smartly on the fence at the quarter pole, shifted out to the three
path to pose a threat at the top of the lane, could not sustain the run and stalled at the sixteenth pole. MOONBRIGHT travelled just behind the front pair
inside of rivals down the backstretch, was roused at the quarter pole keeping pace with the leaders, shifted out to be four wide in the mix between horses
straightening out for the drive but could not go on with others in the final furlong. PERFECT PROVISION settled on the outside in the second flight outside of
runners down the backstretch, continued to chase the leaders outside around the bend, angled out to be in the five path with rivals on either side turning for
home but could not find more late to get into contention in deep stretch.

Footnotes
T'PRING was well-positioned in behind the leaders stalking two to three wide, came out a path in upper stretch with aim, inched nearer the leaders then
surged late to prevail over SWEEPING PASSION, who settled inside and just off the leaders tracking inside, saved ground on the turn, bid inside taking the
lead in mid-stretch, was outfinished. FEW REGRETS bobbled ever so slightly at the start, settled well back of the leaders near but off the rail, moved out
three to four wide through the turn, kept on in the stretch to get up for show honors late. CRYSTAL THE PISTOL was urged from the break, set the pace
from off the inside, moved clear past the three-eighths, weakened in the stretch. MOET MONET was in tight and steadied soon after the start, raced outside
off the leaders about three to four wide into the turn, was forced to fan eight deep leaving that bend as rivals drifted out, finished up willingly. ROYAL
CHROME broke just a half-step slowly, raced last but one just off the rail, showed mild late interest. GAVEL GIRL pressed from inside early, dropped back
off the leader, switched out past the five-sixteenths and continued to drift six wide coming past the quarter pole, lacked the needed late kick. DADDY'S
DAISY chased from outside five wide, was carried out a few more paths leaving the turn, failed to rally. SHEZ A SEALY lacked early speed trailing the field,
came out nine to ten wide for the drive, was not a threat. NEOLITHIC NATION was urged at the start, chased from between runners three to four deep,
came up empty.

Footnotes
MENDELJOHN (IRE) was content to sit alone tracking the pacesetter down the backstretch, edged a little closer to the frontrunner around the turn and wore
down the leader under left handed encouragement in deep stretch to get up in the final jump. FANCY PHYLLIS took command from the onset, dictated the
pace through the turn with little pressure from other rivals and ran on gamely clinging to the lead at the furlong marker but was caught in the final nod at the
wire by the winner. MIDNIGHT MOONSHINE was in a good spot on the outside watching the top two down the backstretch, kept pace with the leaders
travelling three wide through the turn and willingly finished down the stretch to capture third money. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ had a good position tracking
the front two on the rail down the backside, continued on the fence keeping pace with the leaders around the bend, lacked running room nestled behind the
leader at the top of the lane and could not extend his stride fully to the wire never really having a clear path through the stretch. MIA AND ME was coaxed
on the rail to get interested down the backside, came under a hard ride midway on the turn but made little impression and was not a factor in the drive to the
finish line. C R HOT SHOT was void of early speed trailing down the backstretch, offered a mild run picking up runners inside at the quarter pole but could
not get into contention running to the wire. WILD CONVERSATION broke slowly on the start, had one rival beaten down the back straight, made no impact
running around the turn and had little to show in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF AUDREY broke on top then was allowed to settle racing off the leader in behind and between foes, stalked into the turn, moved four wide
late on that bend, bid in mid-stretch, drifted out badly the remainder of the way under left-handed urging but edged away late. LOADED VIXEN quickly
moved to the lead, set the pace racing off the rail, was mostly in the two to three path, challenged by a far-outside rival in mid-stretch, dug in and fought on
but was outfinished. NORTHERN RUBY was unhurried in the early going, raced five wide early on the turn but moved out a bit for room, came into upper
stretch seven deep, kept on well to gain show honors. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL was outsprinted in the early going, was off the fence through the turn in the three
then four path, was in tight four deep at the top of the stretch between runners, navigated traffic splitting rivals then shifting in and gained belatedly to make
the super. NO WHAMMIE raced up close in behind the leaders going two to three wide through the turn, ran on evenly. AIRY FAIRY was forwardly-placed
between runners up the backstretch but exchanged hard bumps inside and out and checked sharply about the four- and one-half dropping back to the rear,
swung nine wide turning for home, kicked on with mild and willing late interest. BODACIOUS MISS pursued the leader in close range three to four wide,
weakened in the stretch. MI TORMENTA exchanged a bump at the start, settled between foes three wide on the turn, ran on evenly. HIT AND RUN
exchanged a bump at the start, was encouraged forward, shifted in when in tight nearing the nine-sixteenths exchanged some contact and put others in tight
quarters, saved ground on the turn, had no late impact. ENDORPHIN RUSH was off the early pace, advanced some five wide early on the turn, was in a bit
tight between foes at the top of the stretch, flattened out. CHARLOTTE'S SILVER was forwardly-placed inside heading up the backstretch, exchanged some
hard bumps and steadied at the four- and one-half, failed to rally thereafter.

Footnotes
HYPER AWAKENING was content on the inside keeping a close eye on the dueling leaders around the turn, began to reel the tiring early leaders three wide
in upper stretch, seized control at the sixteenth pole and was drawing off when crossing the finish line. GOODNIGHTNGODBLESS was in a good position
on the outside watching the engaging pair throughout the turn, started to close in on the tiring leaders four wide at the top of the stretch and offered a good
finish besting the rest at the wire. SILENT PATSY was situated on the rail stalking in the third flight around the bend, was urged left handed shifted out to the
four path in upper stretch, darted back inside at the eighth pole and surged late between runners to get up for third money in deep stretch. SISTER COUSIN
prompted the pace down the backstretch on the outside, collared the leader at the quarter pole, took control briefly at the furlong marker but faltered in the
final seventy yards to settle for a minor role in the end. LADIES RUM was outside her rival stalking the leaders in the third flight in the turn, angled outside
five wide turning for home and was gaining steadily in the stretch closing the gap on the leaders. I'M AWESOME stalked near the rear down the backstretch,
started a mild run passing foes three wide at the quarter pole, shifted outside in the five path at the top of the lane and finished up mildly to the wire. EMPTY
CHAIRS set the pace under a hold while hounded outside down the backstretch, was headed outside at the quarter pole, gave way to runners in upper
stretch and shortened stride stopping quickly in the final sixteenth. BRAZILIAN LEGACY hesitated slightly at the start, co-trailed between runners at the half,
made a mild run on the fence in the turn but could not get involved in the drive to the wire. SILVER LASSO hopped on the start, co-trailed on the inside with
the other rivals that were off poorly on the break, could not quicken with others through the turn and was not a presence in the stretch drive. BLING
D'MONEY HOME had a poor start to begin, trailed the field shifting off the fence down the back straight, offered little run three wide outside horses around
the turn and lacked a rally down the stretch.

Footnotes
GOLDEN TRAIN tracked from inside, moved out and bid between runners coming to the quarter pole, drifted five deep leaving the turn, moved clear in the
stretch and held sway. THATSITTHATSALL was up close racing outside, caught four to five wide into the turn, dropped back off the leading trio and shifted
in coming to the quarter pole mildly cutting the corner, was then guided back out in upper stretch past the three-sixteenths, proved no match for the winner
but second best. TURF AND SURF was under a strong hold early rating not very kindly off the early pace, shifted in and saved ground on the turn, came out
seven wide in upper stretch, ran on well but too late and got up for honors. EXECUTIVE EFFECT bobbled into a rival at the start, quickly moved clear
setting the pace from just off the rail, weakened. SILVER SIGN chased from outside four to five wide, was within striking distance coming to the quarter
pole, had no extra. I'M EXCEPTIONAL was forced in at the start, settled outside at the back in the three to four path on the turn, swung out eight wide for
the drive, ran on mildly. WAHRER SCHATZ chased three to four wide, falied to rally. LILLZ HOPE was bumped at the break, raced well off the inside in the
four to five path and off the leaders through the turn, failed to rally. TENPENNY NAIL was never a threat.

Footnotes
WILDFIRE travelled four wide outside horses in midfield galloping along under a tight hold down the backstretch, took closer order tracking the top pair
outside into the turn, turned up the pressure bidding for the lead three wide at the quarter pole, took over control by the sixteenth pole and was clearing off
when crossing the line for the score. ANOTHER PINKY was under a snug rein improving on the fence down the backside to force the pace inside by the
half, began to inch away up top midway through the turn, braced for the challenge by the winner outside at the top of the lane but was no match for the
winner in deep stretch. TAPPING A RHYTHM bobbled on the start, crept closer with runners on either side at the quarter pole, swung outside of rivals four
wide turning for home and closed in to capture the show award in the end. PORT RENFREW was allowed to settle trailing the compact field down the
backstretch, rallied three wide around horses at the three eighths marker, angled out to the four path for the stretch drive and won the duel for the minors
through the lane. TACHYON SPEED had one rival beaten while stalking on the fence down the backside, saved ground seeing the field throughout the turn
and passed tired runners in the drive to the finish line. CRIMSON NIGHTS prompted the pace in the two path in the early going, was then throttled down to
watch the front trio up front around the bend, had a chance on the rail in upper stretch for a small piece of the prize but could not find more late and levelled
off in the last sixteenth. WORK IT BABY had a narrow advantage setting a modest tempo up front down the backside, was relegated to a chasing role
between horses on the turn, could not quicken with the leaders on either side at the quarter pole and backed away through the field in the final furlong.

Footnotes
FOREVER DANISH moved forward inside to the lead just outside the five-eighths, was clear on the turn, widened in upper stretch, held safe. GENTLE
SEAS was in range early, dropped back a bit on the turn racing four wide and moving out six deep late on that bend, was gaining late, held off a rival for
place. I'M SNOW ANGEL settled off the pace racing off the inside, fanned seven deep into upper stretch, was gaining outside late. SMOKEN CHLOE
exchanged a light bump at the start, moved forward in pursuit of the leader from between runners heading into the turn, raced mostly three wide on that
bend coming out a further path for the drive, kept on evenly. IRON PRINCESS was reluctant to load, exchanged some bumps at the start, was prominent
early racing inside foes but off the fence, caught about three wide into the turn then moved nearer the rail chasing in behind the eventual winner on that
bend, lacked the needed late kick. ALMONTE PRINCESS was never too far off the leaders racing mostly four wide throughout, went evenly. SAKE AND
SUSHI switched out off the inside heading up the backstretch racing a couple paths off the rail and toward the rear, angled seven deep at the top of the
stretch, ran on. TANGERINE TWIST chased from inside mid-pack and went evenly. LOOK AT LIL SISTER was reluctant to load, attended the early pace
from outside then continued the pursuit four wide through the turn, weakened in the stretch. DEFAMATION broke outwardly bumping a rival at the start, was
near the rail through the turn and never close enough to threaten. BLACKMARSH was forwardly-positioned chasing near but off the inside, came up empty.
I'M PHANTOM dropped back outside three to four wide and faded. MY GIRL LOLI POP got away a step slowly, was outpaced early and showed little.
