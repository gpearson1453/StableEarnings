Footnotes
BAHA SECRET had to steady at the start, tracked in the two path, slipped thru an opening along the rail passing the half, tipped outside of the leader
midway around the turn, floated out to the eight path turning into the stretch, chased on while drifting out into the final furlong, and drew past an inner foe
late. J J MONET set the pace in the two path, was roused midway around the turn, tipped out to the five path entering the stretch, and stayed on, but drifted
out in the final sixteenth, and was caught by an outer foe in the closing stages. A J'S MEMORY rated in the five path, was cued midway around the turn,
swung out to the eight path turning into the lane, had to tip further out, and kept on for show. CHERU raced off the pace in the six path early, was under right
handed encouragement in the three path midway around the turn, but drifted out in the stretch, and made no impact. LOLA LOCA trailed and was coaxed
along the inside into the turn, tipped out to the four path under a drive entering the stretch, but could not factor. IMAGE OF CURLIN broke in at the start,
chased in the four path early, tipped inside while under a drive into the turn, but flattened in the three path down the lane. RITAMARLEY hopped at the start,
was prompted along while in range in the three path but faded into the stretch. MRS. CASH MAN was hustled along from up close in the four path but
backed up around the turn.

Footnotes
PORTOFINO set the pace in the three path, was cued in the two path passing the quarter, bumped with an inner foe turning into the stretch, continued to
exchange bumps with the same inner foe while digging in thru the stretch, and held on. CANTARO laid up close between foes in the three path, was roused
in the two path midway around the turn, tried to cut the corner and bumped with an outer foe turning into the stretch, continued to exchange bumps with that
foe while along the inside and dueling into the final furlong, but was outlasted to place. TIVY bumped with an outer foe and had to steady at the start, rated
in the two path, was cued while looking for room passing the quarter, found an opening in the three path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show.
DEVILS ONLY FRIEND pressed the winner in the four path, was roused into the turn, but flattened out in the four path down the stretch.
BEGANINGREENPOINT stalked in the five path, was roused early around the turn, tipped out to the six path turning into the stretch, but faded. ISLAND
SWAGGER veered in at the start, tracked inside, but had to steady along the rail going into the turn, and retreated. GOLD STAR bumped with an inner foe
at the start, and trailed throughout around the four path. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AS WELL AS A JOCKEYS OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF
CANTARO AGAINST THE RIDER OF PORTOFINO TO LOOK AT POSSIBLE INTERFERENCE THRU THE STRETCH, NO CHANGES WERE MADE AS
THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT CANTARO INITIATED THE CONTACT TO MAKE HIS OWN PATH AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH,

Footnotes
MISS SAYELY was bumped between foes at the start, stalked the pace in the two path, spit rivals turning for home, quickly cleared and angled in and
widened under left-handed urging. CANT STOP DREAMING was bumped at the start, trailed inside, made good progress at the rail around the turn, angled
three wide in upper stretch and was clearly second best. SUGAR TREAT dueled in the three path, could not keep pace in upper stretch but kept on to hold
the show. UNRELENTLESS broke out and bumped at the start, dueled inside of foes in the two path and weakened in the drive. TOP BLUE chased the
pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. BELLE'S BLUE BELL was bumped between foes at the start, chased the pace five wide and was through
after a half. HEPBURN was very reluctant to load, pressed the pace four wide and faltered after a half.

Footnotes
ROTTERDAM was reluctant to load and bobbled at the start, rated in the three path, was coaxed into the far turn, swung out to the seven path turning into
the stretch, rallied past an inner trio while drifting in before the sixteenth, and held on. ANAMNESTIC raced off the pace in the five path turning into the
backstretch, ranged up in the four path around the far turn, swept to the lead while in the five path turning into the stretch, was caught by an outer foe
around the sixteenth, dug in to try and fight back, but had to settle with place. EXTREME ACCESS trailed in the two path, fanned out to the nine path under
a drive turning into the lane, and kicked on for show. SWAN LAKE set the pace in the two path, was ridden into the far turn, stayed on turning into the
stretch, but faded in the final furlong. CENTRODELANTERO stalked in the four path, was roused in the two path into the far turn, swung from the three path
into the lane, and fought on, but had to steady around the sixteenth. VETERANS BEACH tracked in the two path, was cued from the rail into the far turn, but
retreated.

Footnotes
BRING THEBAND HOME broke sharply, set the pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. CLASSIFY was off slowly, advanced inside down the
backstretch, prompted the pace in the three path around the turn, could not reel in the winner in the lane but stayed on to be well clear of the rest. BEASTLY
SPEED saved ground off the pace and kept on at the rail for the show. GIROOVIN raced off the pace four wide and improved position in the stretch.
APOCALYPSO chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. BELTS 'N BROOKS played no factor while racing two wide. DANZIG CHIPS
chased the pace four wide and retreated after a half. HARD ROCK GOLD was outrun while racing four and five wide.

OUTLAW COUNTRY raced off the pace in the three path, was driven along the rail around the turn, tipped back out to the three path at the top of the lane,
rallied between foes into the final sixteenth, and got up on the wire. NICHIREN stalked in the three path, took aim from the five path turning into the stretch,
surged to the lead passing the sixteenth, but was nailed on the wire by an inner foe to place. PICO D'ORO chased in the five path, was under right handed
encouragement in the three path midway around the turn, angled out to the six path in upper stretch, and kicked on for show. HOPE IN HIM bumped with an
outer foe at the start, set the pace in the two path, was cued midway around the turn, stayed on in upper stretch, but faded in the final sixteenth. PUTIN
ONLINE trailed in the two path and made no impact from the five path in the stretch. COMPETITIVE SAINT raced wellback along the inside and never
threatened. CAJUN BROTHER tracked in the four path, floated out to the six path around the turn, and flattened from the eight path in the stretch.
ZYRAMID bumped with an inner foe at the start, pressed the pace in the four path but weakened in the final furlong.

BOSTON PRINCESS rated in the three path, waited around the far turn, was roused while shifting out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and rallied to
be up in the final strides. HAY HAY PAULA laid off the pace along the inside, was ridden into the far turn, fanned out to the eight path turning into the
stretch, and was surging late to be up for place. BEACH PARTY BINGO set the pace in the three path, was roused from the two path into the far turn,
floated out to the five path at the top of the stretch, kept on into the final furlong, but was caught late by an outer pair to show. CRYSTAL COAST stalked in
the two path, cut the corner under a drive turning into the lane, and finished evenly. KITTENZEN tracked in the five path, was nudged along in the four path
around the far turn, tipped into the two path at the top of the stretch, but failed to bid. NEOGEM was unhurried in the four path early, ranged up under a ride
in the six path turning into the lane, but flattened. PROVOKE ME laid up close in the four path, was roused in the three path midway around the far turn, but
gaveway into the stretch.

ROD TWO ROD set the pace in the two path, drew off under a drive in upper stretch and held clear. MAJOR KING raced off the pace four wide, continued
on the left lead to the sixteenth pole and rallied for the place. DOUBLE PLAY KING raced in range three wide, lacked the needed rally but kept on to hold
clear of the rest. CAPTURETHELAUGHTER saved ground off the pace, angled four wide near the quarter pole and never threatened. FORT ATTITUDE
steadied along down the backstretch, chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. EXALTED CHARM failed to menace while racing three wide.
SMOKIN CLOUD had early speed while racing very wide down the backstretch, pressed the winner in the three path around the turn and faltered in the
lane. FABRICATOR trailed throughout.
