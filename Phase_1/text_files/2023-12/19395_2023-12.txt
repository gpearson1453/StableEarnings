Footnotes
LOVEU AND PROUDOFU raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a bid and proved the best late. KAHAAL sprinted
to the front, drove clear and was outfinished late for the win. DOUBLE TRAP lacked early speed, moved up from the outside around the turn, gained late but
could not catch the top two. BAYOU BEAUX moved up quickly to race behind the leaders but weakened late. MORE LIKE IT broke a step slow, raced in the
back in the early going, moved up from the inside around the turn but was never a serious threat. RAP ARTIST lacked early speed and was never a factor.
CHICAGO CHROME raced near the middle of the field, dropped back and was outrun. ROYAL CONSORT pressed the pace and made a steady retreat.

MUCHMORETHANREADY unhurried in the beginning, racing in the rear, moved up five wide around the final turn, pulled away and won handily. DIXIE
FARMER lacked early speed, raced outside around the second turn, made a bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. PICKIN ANA
GRINNIN raced within striking distance, saved ground around the final turn and proved no match for the top two. BETISON pressed the early pace,
weakened and finished evenly in the middle of the pack. MEGANS MILLIONS raced evenly near the back and showed little. BLUE RIDGE QUEEN
challenged on the front end and dropped back. ARMS APRIORITY showed early speed, retreated to the back, was distanced and walked off.

JUST A WIN unhurried in the beginning, moved up, racing four wide around the second turn, drove clear and was kept to the task. EASY ACT void of early
speed, made a late gain, rallied wide and closed well. THAT IS AWESOME vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick.
GRAEME'S DEAL lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. MOR KISSES dueled on the front end, was finished early and faded.
SABERFIGHT showed early speed, saved ground around the second turn and dropped back. AUNT JANA lacked early speed and was never close.

Footnotes
UXMAL pressed the pace, raced close throughout, drove clear down the home stretch and was kept to the task. DONEGAL FACTOR dueled on the front
end, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. SEIZE THE TREASURE challenged for the early lead,
racing between rivals, eased off the front, entered the final stretch five wide, made a bid and got up for third. KID SHELLEEN lacked early speed, made a
late bid and was outfinished for third. MAZING MARK raced in the middle of the field, came around the final turn wide and finished evenly. ELUSIVE D'ORO
void of early speed, saved ground around the second turn and lacked a late bid. MIDNIGHT RULES always raced near the back and showed little. FLYING
HOUDINI showed early speed, drove clear down the backside and dropped back. MOSQUITO FLEET raced in the middle of the field, came around the first
turn on the outside, dropped back and was eased to the wire.

early part, moved up, made a mild bid, but was no match for the top two. WINMOR WENDY lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor. YES JACK
raced near the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. SECRET RIDDLES dueled on the front end in the early going and faded. I NITA
