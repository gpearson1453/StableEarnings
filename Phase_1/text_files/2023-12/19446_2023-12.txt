MISS UNCONCERNED stalked the leader up the backstretch, began a bid from the three and four path coming around the turn, drifted out in the lane,
bumping with TOODALOO Y'ALL in the process and held off that rival to the wire. TOODALOO Y'ALL veered out at the start, settled in the middle of the
pack for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, raced into traffic and was bumped several times by MISS
UNCONCERNED and gained ground steadily to the finish from there. STAR OF SARAH led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving
ground around the turn, was caught in the stretch and kept on to the wire. SHARP PIPPA raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter,
navigated the turn from the three path and finished evenly. WOW LADY pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path
around the bend and weakened in the lane. JOYOUS FAIRY TALE hopped up leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn and never threatened. DIAMOND STARDUST trailed the field through the early going, saved ground around the bend and showed
no kick. THE RAIN IS COMING tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and faded in the stretch.
MARISSATHEPRINCESS raced at the back of the pack through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and made no bid. THE RIDER OF
HORSE TEN, TOODLELOO Y'ALL CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HORSE TWO, MISS UNCONCERNED, CITING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. A
STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS ALSO MADE INTO THE SAME INCIDENT. UPON REVIEW, HORSE TWO, MISS UNCONCERNED WAS DISQUALIFIED
AND PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE.

around the bend and kept on in the lane. ARELLA STAR led the way on the inside up the backstretch, battled from the two path around the turn and

SHAQ DIESEL bumped lightly with the horse to his outside at the start, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming
around the turn, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground late to get up for the win in the final jump. DEAN DELIVERS bumped mildly with the horse
to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to duel on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the bend and dug in
gamely in the lane but was caught in the final stride. BIG MARTINI tracked the pace setter on the outside through the early going, navigated the bend from
the two path and kept on in the stretch. WILLY BOI raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, came around the bend in the three path and finished
evenly. THE SKIPPER TOO dropped back to trail well behind the field racing up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made up some ground
in the stretch but never truly threatened. KHOZEIRESS chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter, continued around the turn in the two
path and weakened in the lane. ZYDECEAUX veered in leaving the gate, recovered to duel on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while saving
ground around the turn and continued to tire in the stretch.

Footnotes
BLUEFIELD stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground to
the wire to get up for the win late. DREAM CONCERT pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, took over the lead while saving ground around
the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and was caught late. ATOMICALLY tracked the pace setters on the outside through the opening stages, navigated
the turn from the three path and chased on to the finish. PACIFIC PRINCESS chased the leaders on the inside early, saved ground around the bend and
finished evenly. CHARLIE'S WISH raced off the pace on the outside early, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and flattened out in the
stretch. HIHELLOHOWAREYOU raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter, came around the bend in the path and offered no bid. DELTA
CHARM led the way on the inside up the backstretch, gave way while saving ground around the turn, dropped back quickly from there and continued to tire
in the lane.

APRIL FOOLS ANDY raced in the two path around the first turn, settled at the back of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bold
bid from the three path coming around the far turn and drew off in the lane. LORD EDDARD STARK brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate,
saved ground early, raced off the pace up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the second turn, began a bid entering the stretch and
gained ground late. FATIMA'S BLESSING saved ground around the first bend, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three
path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground in late stretch. MAGICAL MARRIAGE saved ground around the first turn, tracked the
leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and kept on in the lane. SAMYAZA raced in the middle of the pack on
the inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the second bend and finished evenly. YOU MUST CHILL raced in the three path
early, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far bend from the four path and weakened in the stretch. MEGACITY angled in to
save ground around the first bend, chased the leaders up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and faded in the lane. TEE AT ONE

MEAN TWEETS raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the turn, began a bid passing
the quarter pole and got up for the win late. JOYFUL GHOST chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the turn
and dueled gamely in the lane but was caught near the wire. WILD TIME settled in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening quarter of a
mile, navigated the bend from the three path, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground late. CAPE COD SUMMER raced off the pace on the outside
up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, switched inside in upper stretch and gained ground late to the finish. SALTIN' THE RIM raced at
the back of the pack on the inside early, continued around the turn in the three path and improved position in the lane. BAD HENRY tracked the leader on
the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the bend and was outkicked in the stretch. ACTION DREAM raced off the pace on the inside
through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and made no bid. STEEL HAWK raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early,
continued around the bend in the two path and weakened in the lane. MR MURGO led the way up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the
turn and tired in the stretch. UNIQUE PATH stalked the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the turn and
continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
SACRED IMAGE was away from the gate slowly, saved ground around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch,
swung out to the four path coming around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground steadily to get up for the win late. MAYFLY
raced in the three path around the first bend, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path and
dueled to the wire but just missed. VICTORIA'S DANCER saved ground early, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the second
turn from the two path and chased the top two home in the lane. STORMY DISCO raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch
in the middle of the pack between horses, began a bid from the three path coming around the far turn and improved position from there. TAKE THE
COOKIES raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, navigated the far bend from the two path and improved position in the stretch.
SEAT AT THE TABLE raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground
around the far turn and finished evenly. DATAW ISLAND raced in the three path around the first bend, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the
pack on the outside, angled in to save ground around the far bend and was outkicked in the stretch. PRINCESS FANNY saved ground around the first turn,
led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the second turn and tired in the lane. ROYAL GARDEN raced in the two path around the first
turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far bend still in the two path and made no bid. A FANCY SOLUTION chased the leader
