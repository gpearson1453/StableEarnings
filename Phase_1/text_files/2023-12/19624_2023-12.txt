Footnotes
WHOCOULDASKFORMO raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began
a bid while saving ground around the far turn and drew off in the stretch. PRINCESS ALESKA raced in the three path early, led the way up the backstretch,
dueled from the three path around the far turn, could not go with the winner in the lane and chased that rival home. JASSAI raced in the two path around the
first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far turn from the three path and finished evenly. RUE CAMBON
raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening half mile, came around the far bend still in the two path and was outkicked in the lane.
CARINA NEBULA saved ground early, chased the leader up the backstretch, dropped back while racing on the rail around the far bend and weakened in
the stretch. ESTRELLA KIARA hit the gate leaving it, trailed the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground throughout and was never a factor.

around the far turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late to get up for the win. D CITY GIRL raced in the three path early, stalked
the leaders from well off the pace on the outside, came around the far bend in the four path, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground steadily to the
wire. LUCKY IN LOVE saved ground around the first turn, settled off the pace between horses for the run up the backstretch, continued around the second
bend in the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. ALGARCA raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the
leaders well behind those rivals racing up the backstretch, navigated the far bend from the two path and improved position in the lane. TESHIMA raced in
the four path around the first turn, opened up on the field racing up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and was caught in the final furlong.
AMOR SALVAJE raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, swung out to the five path coming around the second bend and passed
tiring horses in the lane while never truly threatening. ITRIEDSELLINGHER bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, raced in the three path around
the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and made no bid. DESTIN FOR DRAMA bumped with the horse to her
outside and was forced back leaving the gate, raced in the three path early, trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and
was empty in the lane. MY RED PRINCESS hopped up leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up
the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and faded in the stretch. FINAL NOTE headed into the first turn in the two path, trying to run
out around that bend, was held in place by her rider to chase the leader up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three path and tired in the
stretch.
