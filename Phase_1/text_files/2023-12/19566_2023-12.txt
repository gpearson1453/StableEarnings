the lane. ADIOS BABY raced off the pace early, came around the turn in the four path, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground late. NIGHT CAP
bumped with the horse to her outside at the start, pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the bend and chased
on to the finish in the stretch. SHE'S PEACHY KEEN tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the five path and finished
evenly. MAMA MARIA hopped up and bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to stalk the leader on the outside through the
opening quarter of a mile, continued around the bend in the two path and was outkicked in the lane. MERCY WARREN led the way on the inside up the
backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and faded in the final furlong. BERAVINA chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch,

Footnotes
SIRIUS LIGHT tracked the leader between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and dueled gamely to the wire to just get the
bob. JORDI'S DREAM led the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend, dug in gamely in the stretch and dueled to the wire to just miss.
PRINCESS BRITNI stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and chased on in the stretch. WE SHALL
SEE chased the leader on the inside through the early going, continued around the turn in the two path and kept on in the lane. MISS TEN K hopped up
leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter, came around the turn in the three and four path and improved position from
there. TABOR TIME raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and was outkicked in the stretch.
DIAMONDS JOY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, continued around the bend in the four path and showed no kick. REE tracked the
pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and faded in the lane. TEDDY BALABAN raced off the pace on the
outside up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the two path and made no bid. ROULA'S REVENGE veered in leaving the gate, trailed the
throughout, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.
