Footnotes
SQUASH BLOSSOM unhurried to the turn with a wide rally into the stretch well handled to the wire while clear. LITERARY bore in at the start, chased pace
throughout to run on for place. ROCKABILLIE good position to the turn, angled wide into the stretch for show. ALLINTHECALL chased to quarter pole,
dueled into the stretch, weakened back. COZEE MAGIC broke slow from the gate, no speed to the turn, cut the gap late. VIDEO PRINCESS raced along
evenly and lacked a response when needed. PITTORE D'ORO never menaced throughout. VIVID EXPOSURE quick speed to clear early, dueled into the
stretch,
empty
late.

Footnotes
CAROM inside speed, battled along on the front, stayed on to far turn and dug in gamely to stay on to the wire. JOB SECURITY inside run to backstretch
never far back, rallied along in the stretch but just missed. VASILEVSKIY (IRE) no speed to far turn with a late run to cut the gap for show spot. INHERENT
POWERS good position never far back to far turn wide run stretch, hung. COUNTY COURT slow from gate, raced back to far turn, leveled off in the drive.
DON'T POKE THE CAT raced along evenly with no response when needed far turn. TAMANRASSETT off rail speed to chase to the half with nothing left in
stretch. MONKEY ZONE trailed to the half while never a factor throughout. TAKE CHARGE GENT off rail run on the backstretch close up, gave way readily
into the far turn. LUCKYINKENTUCKY never factored throughout.
