Footnotes
SILO RIDGE was bumped while forced out at the start and off a bit slow, established a nice position behind the leading trio under urging, chased two then
three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, gained to take the lead inside the furlong marker then moved clear while lugging in some under
steady handling. WAR STRIDE was bumped just after the start while off a bit slow, moved up on the outside to contest the pace outside of two opponents,
vied in the three to four path on the turn, led into upper stretch, maintained the lead under a drive into the final furlong then was overtaken by the winner
while clear for the place. LIGHT THE WAY came away in good order, showed good speed then disputed the pace loosely between horses, vied in the two to
three path while poking a head in front on the turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but held the show.
PLAY broke in the was corrected by the rider and hustled, was shut-off early by the pacesetter and checked, dropped to the rear under urging, went two
then three wide on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and improved position. LOGIN REQUIRED broke out then was hustled, angled in early and
put PLAY in tight quarters, disputed the pace on the inside of two foes, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back nearing the quarter-pole, moved out into
the final furlong and tired. GOLD 'N' SCARLET was fractious in the gate, bumped with foes on both sides and was taken up while off slow, went three then
two wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
NO BURN was well rated three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to battle TRUCULENT for command, took over nearing the quarter pole and drew
off in the final furlong to prove best while being kept to crop urging. TRUCULENT stalked the early pace four to three wide, made a bid three to two wide on
the far turn, battled with the winner to nearing the quarter pole, angled out by the furlong marker and proved to be no match for the winner while saving the
place award. HIGHER QUALITY was rated on the inside, eased out on the turn and was three wide by the quarter pole, then won the battle for the show
award while lacking a closing bid. SIX PERCENT was allowed to settle two to three wide early, four wide advance on the turn, but flattened out the final
furlong and was out-kicked for the show award. FUNKENSTEIN set the pace from the inside, headed nearing the three eighths marker, then gave way.
AMERICA'S JUSTICE moved up into the first turn to prompt the pace in between rivals on the first turn, two wide on the backstretch, then tired on the turn.

Footnotes
HATCH tracked the pace on the outside, stalked three to four wide on the turn, was given his cue while making a bid at the five-sixteenths, was driven five
wide into the stretch, battled outside of the runner-up under a drive into the final sixteenth and got up late under strong urging to narrowly prevail. UNCLE
GEORGE disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path while asked on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch under a drive, led
determinedly until the final strides but was denied. GOOD RAPPORT was urged along off the pace, chased two then three wide on the turn, dropped back
to the two path into the stretch, pursued the top two under a drive into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and just missed while well clear for the
show. BLUE PLATE SPECIAL was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled well back in the field, saved ground on the turn, turned into the
stretch in the two path and was no factor. G MUNNING reared badly at the start then tossed his head while checked several times with the rider trying to get
corrected, spotted the front many lengths, raced at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn and also was no factor. DADS GOOD RUNNER disputed
the pace on the inside of a foe, was roused along the rail on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and tired.

BIG ENGINE chased the pace on the outside early, raced four to five wide on the turn, came six wide off the turn and closed well on the outside to get up in
time to prove best, driving. PRINTRACK set a pressured pace on the inside, headed on the turn and passed nearing the quarter pole, then ran on through
the lane but was out-kicked by the winner. NOLO CONTESTO pressed the early pace in between rivals, made a bid on the turn in between rivals to vie for
command, then fought gamely to the wire but was outfinished. AIR SHOW was rated along two wide early, eased out on the turn, came five wide into the
lane, made a bid but was blocked behind horses nearing the sixteenth marker and had to steady and angled out and then was gaining late. MISTER J T
prompted the pace on the outside, made a three to four wide bid on the turn to vie for command, then battled to the furlong marker but was outfinished.
EGO MAN was well placed early on the inside, swung out three wide by the quarter pole, then angled in the inside but came up empty.

Footnotes
DONTBELATE broke out at the start, showed good speed and led past the three-quarter pole, lost the lead shortly thereafter then pressed the pace on the
outside, vied in the three path on the turn, regained the advantage with three furlongs to run, shook clear under a drive into the final furlong and proved best
under strong urging. CRITICAL THREAT was well placed just off the pace, came under urging while moving from the rail to the two path on the turn, swung
four wide into the stretch and finished willingly to just get the place. WINNING DRIVE settled under some urging, was roused three wide on the turn, came
five wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead until near the sixteenth-pole then swapped to the proper lead and also finished willingly but just missed
the place. NOBODYRIDESFORFREE moved up to get the lead inside the three-quarter pole, showed the way under pressure to his outside, lost the
advantage along the rail at the three-eighths pole, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. WHAT'S MY CATEGORY settled on the outside, was roused five
wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. FIRST DEPUTY settled off the pace, was taken under a snug hold while off heels near the
five-eighths pole, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. JOKER BOY was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, went four wide on
the turn and failed to respond.

ROLLIN IN DOUGH was close up early in the two path, shifted out to stalked the leaders three wide on the turn, made a three to four wide bid off the turn,
lugged in by the three sixteenths, then was corrected and closed well in the final sixteenth to get up in time, driing. CALDO CANDY set the early pressured
pace on the inside, then vied for the lead on the inside on the turn, made a bid to shake clear by the furlong marker, but was denied late to just miss.
FRIDAY I'M IN LOVE broke out and bumped a rival while off a beat slow, then went up to track the pace on the inside, saved ground on the turn, was with in
range by the furlong marker but lacked the needed winning bid, bested rest. PASCHAL MOON chased the early pace three wide, four wide on the turn and
came five wide off the turn but had no punch in the drive. GOOD REUNION was off slow and bumped at the start, then settled on the inside, saved ground
on the turn, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally. FLIP'S DREAM was bumped from both sides and pinched back at the break, then reserved, three
wide by the quarter pole, angled out to the far outside and had some late gain. FLYING IN STYLE was ridden along early and raced on the inside but had
no response. THE MIGHTY DON pressed the early pace and made a bid two wide to vie for command on the turn, then steadied slightly while tiring leaving
the three sixteenths and dropped back. There was a STEWARDS INQUIRY into the running the stretch, but after video review the race was left as is.

Footnotes
HOT FUDGE stalked the early pace three wide, made a three wide bid in hand nearing the quarter pole, then shook clear nearing the sixteenth marker and
held off KANT HURRY LOVE to prevail under a drive. KANT HURRY LOVE shifted out early to chase the pace four to three wide, then raced in the three
path on the turn, came five wide off the turn and closed under left handed crop to just miss. HEADLAND vied for the early lead and made a two wide bid on
the turn to duel for command, then gained a short advantage by the quarter pole, battled to inside the furlong grounds before weakening late, bested rest.
YOU LOOK COLD was taken back early, saved ground on the turn, angled out to the far outside at the three sixteenths and lacked a winning rally. OLGA
ISABEL bobbled slightly at the start, then showed good speed on the inside to vie for command, then was overtaken by the quarter pole and then was
empty in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SCARLET'S DREAM broke a step slow, moved up to track the pace on the outside, was asked while three to four wide on the turn, gained to make a bid in
upper stretch then took the advantage, fought outside of the runner-up to the finish and proved best under good handling. FABULOUS FOX bumped lightly
with a foe after the start, angled in while showing speed, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, turned into the stretch in
the two path, fought on inside of the winner in the final furlong but was outfinished late while able to get the place. POSEIDON'S MIST was well placed just
off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the turn, chased the top two under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the
show. CALL HER BLUFF was hustled from the gate, moved up outside the five-eighths pole, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, shifted from the
rail to the two path on the turn, moved out in the stretch and gained some but failed to impact. PHOTO FINISH made light contact with an opponent after the
start, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. DOLCE VELOCE was
hustled from the gate then taken in hand early and rated off the pace, came under urging late on the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn, spun
six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SAVING MEMORIES settled on the inside, dropped back late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn
and failed to respond. LUCKY SPIN settled at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn and was no factor.
