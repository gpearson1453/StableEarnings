raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane and closed mildly. PACHELBEL broke a step slow, chased inside and tired. AYEARTOREMEMBER
chased three wide, came three wide into the lane and tired. TRUST THE NUMBERS was bumped at the start, stalked close up four wide, chased the winner

Footnotes
JSK LUCKY'S PUSHPA stalked the pace three wide, moved easily to the front on the turn then quickly pulled away under moderate urging. ONLY GIRL
settled off the pace, advanced on the turn and proved easily second best. BIONIC KAT forced the pace between rivals, faded on the turn but lasted for the
show. MAP OF LIFE lacked speed then rallied mildly just missing the show. OVERTHEBLUESKY lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. THE
BAWSE'S LADY broke in a complete tangle, rushed up then gave way. AUGIE'S GIRL forced the pace along the inside for half a mile and stopped.
NAUTICAL MILE hesitated at the break spotting her field several lengths and showed nothing.

SECRET PATH settled well back inside, angled out in the stretch, offered a late surge and pulled away in the late stages. SAMARONTI rated off the leaders
outside, bid to the front in midstretch then weakened but held the place. SOCIAL GROUP vied outside to the final furlong and faltered. SCREEN SAVER
eased back on the first turn, bid wide on the final turn then flattened out in the final furlong. HIDDEN PROMISE angled inside after opening quarter, awaited
room on the final turn then came up empty when clear. TEEWINOT PASS trailed far behind, moved extremely wide on the final turn then showed late
energy. POLAR WIND chased five wide on the first turn, remained wide and faltered. HENRYTHETHIRD angled inside early, dropped far behind and was
never a factor. INDOCTRINATE dueled along the inside for three quarters and stopped. MARCO ISLAND was a late scratch at the gate on the advise of the
track veterinarian.
