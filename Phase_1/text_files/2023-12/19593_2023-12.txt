Footnotes
CUSTOM COMEDY set the pace inside of a vying rival around the turn, dueled with that one through midstretch, inched ahead entering the final sixteenth
and found the wire in time. CAROLINA JACY lunged inwardly and was off slow at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five path
entering the lane, floated further to the seven path in upper stretch before unleashing a good kick in the final furlong, surged up to the leaders to bid a the
wire but narrowly ran out of ground. BRIELLE EVANGELINE prompted three wide, bid and vied outside of the leader while taking the turn in the three path,
dueled through midstretch, but failed to maintain even terms with a sixteenth to go and got nailed for place. NICELY UNIFIED stalked along the inside,
drifted out to the five path in upper stretch while pursuing the top pair and chased evenly through the final furlong. STRUMMIN MARY lacked speed along
the inside, shifted out nearing the lane, then improved position while shifting inwardly on her left lead. MY SUGAR FIX pressed two wide and between
horses, chased the top pair around the turn, shifted outside of them entering the lane, then gave way while hanging on her left tlead. HOT GOLDEN GIRL
chased from midpack in the three to four path before fanning to the six path entering the lane, then weakened while drifting inwardly. JAZZ JAZZ JAZZ laid
off of the pace along the inside and faded. AVIE J got rank while breaking slowly, then was outrun in the four to five path.

Footnotes
MY BARILEY settled off of the pace along the inside, then two wide around the far turn before shifting to the five path entering upper stretch, rallied to bid
outside of the new leader at the sixteenth pole and edged past. KNIGHT'S CROSS stalked in the three path, crept forward to striking range on the clear
leader around the far turn, bid in midstretch, led leaving the furlong grounds, but met an outer challenge entering the final sixteenth and was bested late.
CLASSIC KING tracked while shifting from the two to four path around the first turn, inched closer pursuing the top pair around the far turn, but lacked a bid
before being outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, yet kept on thereafter to reach show. BLURT was hustled leaving the gates to speed clear in
the two path approaching the first turn, showed the way around the far turn, but was headed by an outer bidder inside the final furlong and gave way.
NATE'S REVENGE trailed in the three to two path, swung out to the six path in upper stretch and moved up. MILLARD'S SMILE pursued from midpack
tucking to the inside around the first turn, then saved ground around the far turn and faded. WARRIOR'S RUN lacked speed in the four path and tired.

NILES CHANNEL tracked along the inside, gained place tipping outside of the clear leader entering the lane, ranged up to bid at the furlong grounds while
hanging on his left lead and edged past. OF THE MOMENT stalked three wide around the first turn, vied down the backstretch, led and crossed over to the
inside entering the far turn, drew clear entering the lane, dug in to resist an outer challenge at the furlong grounds but was grudgingly bested. SHADY
MCGEE (IRE) settled off of the pace three to four wide, picked up stride fanning to the six path entering the lane and stayed on to slowly close in on the top
pair in the final furlong. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) rated well back along the inside, took the far turn in the four path before shifting out to the seven path in
upper stretch and rallied willingly. ONE TIME GEM prompted outside of the leader early on, then between horses down the backstretch, chased his outer
clearing counterpart from the three path around the far turn, entered the lane in the four path and yielded. SCORING DRIVE set the pace along the inside,
vied with an outer pair down the backstretch, chased the clearing new leader from the two path around the far turn and gave way. BAKENEKO pursued from
midpack two wide and between horses, was held up among foes around the far turn, encountered traffic in the four path in upper stretch, altered inwardly
soon after but lacked a bid through the final furlong. TELEPHONE TALKER settled off of the pace two wide, retreated behind traffic among foes around the
far turn, then was forced to bump an inner rival once put to crowded quarters nearing midstretch and failed to menace. NOBLE PURSUIT raced at the rear
in the four to five path and failed to factor. EASTER SNAP pursued from midpack four wide and tired between horses in upper stretch. DEVAMANI (FR)
saved ground off of the pace, took contact from an outer rival approaching midstretch and faded.

SHE'S A BIG STAR showed the way from a pressing pair, cleared in the two path entering the lane, then inched away while drifting out. AVERI EVER
AFTER prompted two wide and between horses, chased those rivals from the inside around the far turn, kept on to regain place in upper stretch and held
that position from a outer late bidder. NO NANNETTE NO tracked along the inside, then form the two path around the far turn, tipped out to the five path in
upper stretch and stayed on willingly. CAVIAR RESOLUTION trailed along the inside, saved ground around the far turn, advanced entering the lane, tipped
out while vying for show at the furlong grounds but was outkicked shortly after. RYAN'S GRACE laid off of the pace in the four to three path, floated from the
five to six path in upper stretch and failed to factor. WATRUGONNADOKAREN stalked three wide, pressed two wide around the far turn, but drifted to the
four path entering the lane and gave way. PELLETIER tracked two wide and between horses, but faded in the three path turning for home. MORNING LINE
NEWS settled off of the pace in the three path but was done early.

JUST BATTLE dictated terms via a clear advantage and held firm through the lane under a drive. BILLY'S GOT ISSUES settled off of the pace in the two
path, saved ground traveling well around the far turn, gained to the pocket turning for home, sustained rail progress to gain place at the three sixteenths
pole, then tipped outside of the clear leader and chased that one home while pulling away from the rest. FAITH RUNNER pursued from midpack along the
inside, crept closer entering the far turn, vied for place under urging while aiming outside of the clear leader around the far turn, but lacked a bid and chased
in upper stretch, dueled for show with an outer foe through the final furlong and prevailed. SIR LIAM bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, pursued
from midpack three to four wide, ranged up around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch, dueled for show with an inner rival late but missed.
KAHALA saved ground well back but to no avail. LIQUID ADDICTION (IRE) pursued two wide and between horses, tipped a bit out in upper stretch but
lacked a bid. HE GOTS TO GO stalked in the three path, checked slightly between horses entering the far turn, backed out turning for home before fanning
to the six path in upper stretch, but lacked bid. BUBBA CAN DANCE broke out and bumped a rival at the start before getting rank in the aftermath, trailed,
took the far turn three wide and failed to factor. VORTEX bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked in the four path, gave way in the five path with five
furlongs to go and was done early. EL PERFECTO stalked in the two path, chased in the three path and between horses around the far turn and weakened
nearing the lane.
