around the bend in the three path and kept on to the wire. REDDEN raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and
improved position in the stretch. RUNAWAY RUSSELL veered in leaving the gate, stalked the leader on the outside early, came around the turn in the three
