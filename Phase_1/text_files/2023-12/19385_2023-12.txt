Footnotes
PINO IN A PURSE took command from the onset, pulled away from pair of chasing rivals through the turn, opened up mildly straightening out for home and
had something left for the drive to hold safe from the closing runner in deep stretch. WINYAH BAY was allowed to settle trailing down the backside, started
picking up horses four wide circling foes at the quarter pole, loomed the main threat outside in the four path finding her best stride at the top of the stretch,
was closing in through the lane but could not get there at the wire. DREAMING OF AUDREY stalked near the rear on the outside, made little headway
running through the turn and showed good late energy in the final eighth to rally in deep stretch to capture third money. FEDALIA improved on the fence at
the half, nestled smartly behind on the rail just behind the winner throughout the turn, was in the mix of things inside turning for home but stalled at the
furlong pole to settle on the fringes. SONET'S NAME chased between foes down the back straight, sat just outside and behind the winner around the bend,
could not go on with others at the top of the lane and weakened in mid-stretch. AMERICAN GAMBLE tracked the frontrunner three wide outside horses
down the backstretch, kept pace with the winner still travelling three wide on the turn, was nudged on for more at the quarter pole, could not keep up with
the front two and flattened out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BACHELOR PAD was brushed outside on the break, took control soon after the start, opened up easily down the back straight, was unopposed travelling in
hand through the turn and coasted home for the impressive front end score. LAPOCHKA was on the rail having on rival beaten down the backside, edged
closer on the rail at the three eighths marker, began to rally shifting outside two furlongs from home, swung out five wide for the stretch run and closed in to
be a distant second behind the dominant winner. VICTORY MARCH stalked near the rear on the outside, made little improvement three wide through the
turn, was floated out to the seven path for the drive and finished up with intent to close in to be a clear third at the finish line. RACE FOR PINKS travelled in
the third flight with runners on each side down the backstretch, was roused in midfield making little progress on the turn, was pushed out to the six path at
the top of the lane and finished up willingly between horses down the stretch for a minor role in the end. NEOPHYTE chased the pace in the early stages,
came under a ride dueling for the place share well behind the long gone winner at the quarter marker, could not find more in the stretch and faded at the
sixteenth pole. SOUPER RIVER settled three deep outside foes down the backstretch in the third flight, offered a mild run around horses three wide at the
three furlong pole, was in the hunt on the outside for the runners up share in the three path turning for home, needed more late and tired between runners in
the last sixteenth. KEEN FLATTER broke inwards on the start, travelled on the rail in the third flight down the backstretch, was scrubbed on inside trying to
keep pace with rivals around the turn and faltered on the fence in upper stretch. BLUE MAX checked mildly between horses soon after the start start to trail
down the backside, could not get interested through the turn and was never involved driving to the finish line.

Footnotes
ENAHM was unhurried trailing the field in the first turn, crept closer to the field under a snug hold on the fence at the half, had no room to run when
surrounded by rivals through the far turn, continued to be blocked by a wall of horses at the top of the stretch, finally angled out having a clear path inside
the eighth pole and closed in quickly under a vigorous hand ride to get up at the wire. CHASING TROUBLE settled near the back in the early going,
co-trailed on the outside three wide at the half, swooped around runners making a bold move five wide at the quarter pole, seized the lead with a sixteenth
to run bit could not hold off the surging winner at the finish. THIS DUDE A BREEZE travelled in midfield down the backstretch, made an early move forcing
the pace three wide at the three eighths pole around foes, shifted out in the five path fighting for the lead with with multiple runners at the top of the lane,
briefly poked his head in front at the furlong pole, could not hold off the top two finishers late and held for the show money at the line. THE NEW MAYBE
assumed the lead after the start, had trouble navigating the first turn bearing out, maintained a slim advantage while hounded outside down the back
straight, dueled on the fence on the final turn and faded in the last eighth holding on for a small piece of the prize at the wire. DARE TO BE KING tracked in
the second flight on the outside down the backstretch, took closer order through the far turn, was in the mix of things in the four path with the field spread
across the pole at the top of the stretch, could not find another gear late and was outfinished in the final furlong. STEADY PROGRESS pressed the issue
inside in the first turn, was reined back to track the engaging leaders down the backside, nestled patiently on the fence around the far turn and offered little
rally in tight quarters on the rail down the stretch. WAR IN CHARGE was pushed out while prompting the pace outside in the first turn, hounded the leader
outside down the backstretch, battled stubbornly outside through the far turn and gave way while surrounded by others in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
CLASSIC DANCER broke alertly, went straight to the front to set the pace in the clear shifting in but racing just off the rail, drifted out in mid-stretch, held.
FABLED PRINCE tracked from inside, came off the fence at the top of the stretch then moved back inside the drifting leader in upper stretch, was within
striking distance inside coming to the furlong grounds but ran on evenly late. SOCIETY'S THUNDER stalked from outside the second group advancing while
moving in from four to three wide on the turn, was carried out a bit leaving that bend by the leader and eventual winner then again nearing mid-stretch,
evened out. TRINITY PARK chased three to four wide, kept on. DREAM ON BABY broke a step slowly and veered out, was carried out by the loose horse
up the backstretch, took back and angled in racing two wide into the turn then nearer the rail, altered course outside foes in mid-stretch and ran on.
WALTER ME LAD was bumped at the start by the riderless horse, tracked from between runners about two wide, dropped back nearing the quarter pole
continuing in behind and off the fence, lacked the needed late kick. DIAMOND HEIST moved out at the start to avoid the loose horse and falling rider then
was placed in tight quarters by that foe, carried out several paths, took back and shifted back in tracking in behind in the four path into the turn, was
encouraged by the quarter pole, moved out further in upper stretch and lacked the needed late kick. MAGNIFICENT MARIO angled in early, saved ground
inside well back of the leader, angled out nine wide in upper stretch, was not a threat. AGILE DANCER stumbled at the start, losing the rider and bumping
the inside foe, chased without a jockey racing up close to the leader, was caught by the outrider past the wire and walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INTO THE START IT WAS DETERMINED EVERY RUNNER RECEIVED A FAIR BEGINNING AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
FEELTHEBEAT took this field on a comfortable lead down the backstretch, dictated the pace unchallenged around the oval and was kept to the task down
the stretch to hold safe at the finish line. ONE MORE BREW had a slow start on the break, recover to travel in mid-pack on the rail at the half, rallied up the
fence at the quarter pole and was gaining mildly down the lane but could not threaten the winner in deep stretch. FORESTER HUMOR settled in the third
flight between horses down the back straight, kept pace through the turn, shifted inwards to the rail by mid stretch and offered a good late run inside to close
in and capture third money. CHAIRMAN BOB broke slowly to begin, co-trailed on the inside at the half, lost his path on the fence in upper stretch, switched
outside at the furlong pole and willingly finished up for a minor share at the wire. SALVATOR MUNDI chased the winner down the backside, continued to
keep up the pacesetting winner around the bend, could not find more at the top of the lane and flattened out between horses at the furlong marker.
THREEFIFTYSEVEN hesitated then hopped at the start, co-trailed on the outside at the half, offered a brief run between runners at the quarter pole and
evened out in upper stretch. PRICELESS WILL chased the frontrunner outside down the backstretch, continued to try to go after winner but to no avail in the
turn and tired in mid-stretch. PALIO stalked in the third flight three deep down the backside, was roused on the turn but was losing positioning to inside rivals
and had nothing to offer in stretch drive. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING THE START RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
HILARIOUS AFFAIR attended the early pace from outside about three deep, took charge up the backstretch, moved clear into upper stretch, was
challenged by a rival nearing mid-stretch who fell then subsequently held safe. GRAN SPIRITED broke outwardly and a step slowly, lacked early speed,
moved outside foes five wide on the turn, kept on to get the place. MIGHTY SEA raced outside a foe off the pace into the turn, fanned out five wide late on
that bend, was in tight quarters just briefly at the top of the stretch, paused briefly near the eighth pole in behind the fallen horse but was soon re-engaged
by the rider with stout urging, couldn't reach the runner-up for the place. GUNS N' ROJAS bumped the outer rival at the start, angled in, saved ground early
on the turn, shifted out four wide leaving that bend, was in tight near mid-stretch and altered out, ran on well but too late. GATLING GUN raced three wide
and outside mid-pack on the turn, steadied in mid-stretch nearing the fallen horse, ran on. BROADWAY SKY broke alertly with the early lead briefly then
dropped back between runners outsprinted heading to the turn, steadied and altered a bit in mid-stretch. SOONER LUNAR was prominent very early then
taken back off of the leaders, chased from between runners on the turn, steadied and altered out in mid-stretch. QUIET INTENT was keen early attending
the early pace inside, dropped back in upper stretch, checked coming up to the fallen horse, lost the rider at that juncture, walked off. ARTIE was bumped at
the break, moved four wide on the turn, drew to within range of the leader and eventual winner nearing mid-stretch, fell, was vanned off. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
CONGLOMERATE was nestled on the rail in the third flight under a good gallop in the beginning, edged closer to the leaders down the backstretch,
patiently waited to pounce inside around the final bend, crept closer by the quarter pole, angled out to the four path driving to the wire, was set down outside
in upper stretch full of run and drew off sharply in the final sixteenth for the score. COLLECTIVE FORCE was alone in midfield under the wire for the first
time, weaved through horses commencing a run at the three furlong marker, saved ground shifting inwards for clear run on the rail in upper stretch, rallied
inside down the lane, angled outside off the tiring early pacesetter at the sixteenth pole and just got up for second money under a heads up ride at the wire.
WIN FOR THE MONEY assumed command from the onset, slowed the pace down nicely after three quarters were run, comfortably setting an honest pace,
put away the chasing rival in upper stretch, braced for the challenge from the winner at the eighth pole, offered little resistance and faded late just being
nabbed for the place share before the finish line. PALAZZI was situated near the back three wide outside foes with a half mile to run, started to pass runners
extending his stride three wide with seven sixteenths from home, swung out with momentum widest in the eight path at the top of the stretch and closed in
strongly full of run late to settle on the fringes in the end. WAR COURT was in a good position going pass the wire for the first time watching the front trio up
top, closed the gap on the front group along the backside, was roused at the quarter pole, angled out in the six path straightening out for the drive in the mix
of things for a share and mildly finished up to the wire. SO HIGH (GB) was under a good hold tracking the pacesetter on the rail, shifted outside to offer a
challenge three wide at the top of the lane, battled in upper stretch, could not find another gear at the furlong marker and faded slightly in the final sixteenth.
MILLIE GIRL stalked in the third flight three wide outside horses in the early stages, began to smartly pick up runners at the seven sixteenths pole, inched
closer through the far turn, angled out seven wide turning for home and gamely battled to the wire, never giving in running against the boys. JIM'S HOPE
travelled in mid-pack saving ground on the rail early on, offered a mild run on the fence going by rivals at the quarter pole and was one paced inside through
the stretch. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION stalked near the back of the pack between foes in the beginning, had one rival beaten travelling down the backside,
made little gain when urged on the final turn, angled outside in the six path turning for home but could not be a presence in the stretch running. ENGLISH
CONQUEROR was situated near the rear three wide outside horses on the first turn, crept closer when roused at the three eighths marker and could not
make any impact running down the stretch. MEYER had a good spot outside, content to track the leader in the early stages on the race, was asked for more
two wide three furlongs out to go after the frontrunner, offered little response and yielded in the two path between horses in upper stretch. SEVENTYSEVEN
STONE trailed the pack on the fence in the early going, passed some rivals saving ground in the second turn, was relegated to the back of the field at the
three eighths pole again and resurged to pass some weary runners in the stretch. LUCKMAN was unhurried, seeing the field into the second turn, made
little improvement on the rail down the back straight and and had nothing to show in the drive to the finish line. RAPPER ZAPPER was shuffled back some
jockeying for position on the first turn between foes, advanced nicely on the outside getting a better spot down the backstretch, was urged midway on the
final turn, could not go on with others and retreated inside in upper stretch.

Footnotes
HAVE A SOUPER DAY angled in settling off the early pace, advanced up the rail into the turn, saved ground on that bend, surged late inside to the lead and
moved clear inside the final seventy yards. STEAK AND CHEESE was quick to the lead, set the pace from off the rail, kicked clear leaving the turn,
shortened stride in the stretch, was second best. TAPSASIONAL switched out off the inside racing two wide in behind the leader into the turn, drifted out a
path leaving that bend, continued to move out in late stretch, kept on evenly. TOP OF THE CHARTS was outpaced early shifting in, saved ground at the
back inside just off the rail on the turn, sought room in upper stretch in behind a drifting rival, ran on. STAR SIGN settled at the back off the inside, raced two
to three wide outside a foe into the turn, came out six wide in upper stretch, ran on. PROVEN STRATEGIES stalked while in hand three to four wide, faded.
BLAST IN THE SNOW switched outside foes advancing outside up the backstretch with forward position four to five wide into and on the turn, tired.

Footnotes
GUILDSMAN (FR) settled off the pace inside into the turn, began to move out leaving that bend, shifted out further in upper stretch, was eight deep coming
to the furlong marker with aim and began to rally more strongly, surged to drive past late. SOUPER CLASSY forced the pace dueling outside a foe two to
three deep, moved clear late on the turn, weakened in the stretch and was outfinished. DRAGON'S BREW settled at the back inside, gradually shifted out
on the turn racing at the rear, came into upper stretch eight deep, gained late but needed more. TOMCAT BLACK tracked in behind the dueling leaders off
the fence and inside a rival, went in the two to three path on the turn, ran on evenly. CEREBRO was hard to load but got away well, settled easing back off
the leading pair stalking the duel into the turn from outside a rival about three wide, moved out a bit turning for home, ran on evenly. MASTER SPY
advanced while fanning widest of all entering upper stretch nine deep but evened out. BOSSY HOLIDAY stalked from mid-pack outside a foe two to three
wide, ran evenly. TRICKY MAGICIAN had forward position tracking off the leaders from inside, came out two to three wide, sought room and was in a bit
tight in upper stretch, ran on. KING ALFREDO raced off the inside part of the course coming out while turning for home, showed mild late interest but was
not a threat. SUNSPEAR raced off the inside in the back half of the field, came into upper stretch five wide, was not a threat. MAD DOG N JOE moved
forward between foes under some coaxing to the lead, dueled inside a rival but just off the fence, faded.
