Footnotes
TIMBERRY TIDDLER stalked the pace drawing even on the turn dueling abreast rival in upper stretch edging clear late. SHAKIN IT BIG TIME rallied on the
turn drawing even on the inside in upper stretch ceding grudgingly late. RESVALON chased the pace looming into upper stretch lacking a closing surge.
JOHN'S KID slow early raced evenly through the lane passing a few there. VAPORIZED alert to clear early was passed on the turn weakening in upper
stretch. IN THE GOSPEL chased close up through the turn wearing out in upper stretch. ANGELUS DIAMOND played no factor. BARELYSTILLCOUNTS
well back early raced wide through the lane. OXBOW'S RIDE was always outrun. BOURBON MOMENT steadied near the seven sixteenths pole would fade
to upper stretch. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF BOURBON MONENT AGAINST THE RIDER OF TIMBERRY TIDDLER FOR INTERFERENCE
NEAR THE SEVEN SIXTEENTHS POLE WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
