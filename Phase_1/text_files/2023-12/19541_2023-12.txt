Footnotes
FLOWER CAT vied for the early lead from the inside then settled off the pace around the turn, angled out to four wide at the top of the stretch and ran down
the leader to draw clear in the final sixteenth. SKIPPA was off a step slow then moved up from between horses on the backstretch, moved out to three wide
on the turn and took the lead at the eighth pole but was collared in the final sixteenth and proved second best. MR. BUTCH WOMBLE went to a pressured
lead to the quarter pole then edged away but was overtaken at the top of the stretch and tired. GOLDENLUTE showed no early speed then moved up to go
between horses at the quarter pole and made a late run in the stretch to improve position. KIT KAT KIDD pressed the pace through the turn then floated out
into the stretch while fighting gamely but weakened. FLASHY BOY rushed up to contention from three wide but lacked a late response.
BULLETSREVENGE was in tight early and taken back to be off the pace but was done. OCEOLA never fired. JOCKEY OBJECTON WAS POSTED, THE
JOCKEY OF KIT KAT KIDD CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF MR. BUTCH WOMBLE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE HALF MILE
MARKER, AFTER A REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AND THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISSALLOWED.

Footnotes
CUTE DINERO QUEEN bobbled shortly after the break but was able to recover and go to the front to a clear lead to set all the pace, was never challenged
but kept to task in the stretch. R T'S GEM was allowed to settle around the first turn the steadily advanced down the backstretch, moved out to four wide at
the quarter pole but couldn't catch the leader but was clearly second best. PICKIN ANA GRINNIN raced off the pace in the second tier from the inside,
never made a bid but held on for the show. FLAWLESS TAKEOVER raced off the pace from two wide in the second tier and finished evenly. THAT'S MY
MAMA raced in the second tier from three wide off the pace and was best of the rest. DEAL ME A PENNY was unhurried and passed tiring rivals.
STARSHIP JAMBALAYA went five wide into the first turn then settled into the middle of the pack while racing four wide and tired. RUN NATALIE RUN raced
in the middle of the pack from three wide around the first turn and retreated.

Footnotes
AMERICAN SMOOTH raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved out to four wide at the three furlong marked and took command at
the quarter pole and won going away. SMART ANALYSIS raced near the back while saving ground down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final
turn and tipped out to the two path into the stretch but was no match for the winner, proved second best. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside to the final turn then angled out to three wide at the three sixteenths pole for a late run but flattened out and was best of the others.
BELLO CREEDO was forwardly placed of the leader down the backstretch, moved up to engage the leader at the three furlong marker but was empty.
PLENTY OF CENTS was allowed to settled near the back down the backstretch then moved out to three wide on the final turn and tipped out to five wide in
upper stretch to pass the tiring rivals. RAUL'S ENCANTO raced off the pace from the inside to the quarter pole the moved out to three wide but weakened.
HOMELAND MESSA raced in the middle of the pack and was not a threat. CARLOS' BLAST trailed the field to the turn and was never a factor. G E H
GIANTS WAY hustled to the a clear early lead from the inside then was over taken at the quarter pole and tired.
