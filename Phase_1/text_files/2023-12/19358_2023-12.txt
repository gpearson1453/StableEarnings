run to the turn, kept on in the stretch to run on for the place spot. WEEKEND CONCERTO rushed from inside to the lead, dueled in the stretch, weakened.
I'M FREE outside trip throughout while evenly, no late kick in the stretch. THISISRIDICULOUS broke slow from inside, never untracked and no threat.
KYKEON raced between horses to turn, off rail into stretch with no kick. CASSIUS tried to keep up to the turn with nothing left and faded back. MYSTIC
POWER never factored throughout. KIA ORA hesitated from the gate, far back throughout. FEAR AND LOATHING pressed leader to the quarter pole, came
up empty in the drive.

MISS GETTY UP squeezed back start, no speed to far turn with strong run through the stretch to prevail. BEACH KITTEN inside speed, dueled to far turn,
shook free in the stretch but run down at the wire. NIGHT LIVIN unhurried to the turn with a late run for the show spot. NIGHT KISS tracked to the turn,
chased into the stretch, weakened late going. FREE TIME no speed to the half, ran on through the stretch evenly. SCAPITURE never a real factor
throughout with no late response when needed. RECOGNIZE ME raced along evenly with no late kick when needed. JERSEY GOLD chased to the half and
leveled off with no response when needed. DR. BELLA sharp break outside, settled in and never factored. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC good position to the half
with nothing left from far turn. GET A GRIP MARILYN never a factor throughout. INNER HARBOR outside speed, dueled to the turn gave way readily in the
stretch.

RECORD TIME rated along off rail to far turn and never far back, roused, cleared. TWIRLING POINT chased leader to the half, dueled into the stretch, no
match. WOODCOURT sprinted clear, led to deep stretch but weakened back for show spot. TAKEITANDRUN good position while racing evenly with no late
kick when needed in the stretch run. J T'S IMAGINATION never factored throughout. GOOD BALI bothered at the start and failed to menace throughout.
PERFECT PRANKSTER raced widest into first turn with no response when needed. LEGAL TITAN good position from inside to far turn with little response,
faded. SAVE THE KING awkward start, slow into stride from the gate and never menaced.

Footnotes
MS KS DYNASTY unhurried to the turn, rallied confidently to the lead to clear off. FLATTERING HEART had an awkward start from the gate, no speed to
far turn launched circling run out of the turn, no match. EASTERN SUNRISE good position, moved inside at the quarter pole, along for show.
REDHEADEDSTRANGER sharp speed, led to the half, dueled to stretch, weakened late. SILVERY MOON outside run to far turn while evenly long with no
late kick. GREEN CHILE good position early, dueled to the quarter pole used up faded. ROCK N STROLL had an awkward start from the gate, raced back
to far turn only to improve position in the stretch. BELLA SKYE had an awkward start from the gate, raced along evenly off rail with nothing for the drive.
RICHIE'S GAL tried to keep up for a half but gave way readily thereafter. SHOCKING FACTS never a menace throughout. SWEET ENCHANTMENT never
factored throughout. POISED PRINCESS through early with a steady fade.
