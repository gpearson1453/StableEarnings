Footnotes
INCOMPARABLE far behind early, rallied extremely wide on the turn and into the stretch, drifted in and edged off. THE FURMANATOR vied outside with a
narrow lead, pulled away in the stretch then weakened. LIL' LATE LUCK settled off the pace outside, steadied near the eighth pole and rallied strongly too
late. LUCKY BREEZE broke slowest, chased inside and flattened out in the stretch. SAY NO MORE urged three wide off the leaders and faded.
COLETTE'S SPIRIT lacked speed inside and lacked a response. LA LA LUCY lagged far back then caught fading rivals. ARLYNE'S CROWN forced the
pace for half a mile, drifted out in the stretch and stopped. MY INNER VOICE fractious in the gate, flashed speed inside and stopped. Following an objection
by the third finisher against the winner for interference in the stretch, INCOMPARABLE was disqualified and placed third.

Footnotes
MOONLITE IN HEAVEN stalked two wide, bid three wide entering the far turn, took over, drew clear, drifted in slightly past the furlong marker and then held
well under urging. DIXIE GROOVE raced three wide off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn, steadied at the five sixteenths marker, then rallied on the
rail, lacked room past the furlong marker, altered course off the rail and finished evenly. HOLY BERRIES stalked outside, chased on the far turn, rallied
mildly on the rail in the stretch run and got up for third. APPEALINGTOTHE EYE tracked on the inside, bid between rivals entering the far turn, then chased
the winner and weakened late. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS raced two wide on the first turn, then off the pace inside, chased on the far turn and lacked a rally.
CASH ON FIRST raced off the pace with an inside trip and failed to threaten. LORD JOAN was off slowly, trailed the field, came four wide into the lane and
did not factor. BOARDWALK FRIES raced three wide early, then two wide off the pace and gave way. BAY AND GOLD set the pace on the inside, dueled
briefly and gave way on the far turn. A Jockey Objection by the rider of DIXIE GROOVE against the winner was dismissed.

ON THE COME UP set the pace racing with a clear early lead, dueled two wide on the turn, dueled between rivals in the stretch drive, dug in gamely in the
final sixteenth and prevailed in a determined effort. THTWASTHENTHISISNW stalked early on, chased inside on the turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch
drive, dug in gamely inside to the finish and earned the place spot. ALTA FOX was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on
the turn, rallied outside rivals turning for home, dug in gamely outside in the final furlong and battled on to the finish. GO EAST tracked close up on the
inside, made a rail bid on the turn, dueled with the winner, dug in between rivals in the stretch run and weakened late. BOOM BOOM KABOOM stalked
outside, stumbled when appearing to clip heels midway on the turn, then moved up, rallied behind horses in the stretch and finished evenly late.
ESPRESSO LUNGO raced two wide off the pace, checked in traffic at the five sixteenths pole, angled out and had no rally. UPFOR PAROLE bobbled and
was bumped at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. HARLEY'S CHARLY raced off the pace inside, checked in traffic midway on
the turn and failed to threaten. DISCO DEVIL broke awkwardly and was bumped causing the rider to lose the irons, recovered near the half mile marker,
then did not factor. TUNNEL VISION stalked outside, then chased and gave way. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, the race was declared official.

Footnotes
HIDDEN PROMISE well placed inside, angled out on the final turn, repelled challenges and continued gamely to gain the decision. SEVIER prompted the
pace outside, led briefly on the final turn, weakened slightly then came again for the place. SOCIAL GROUP moved just off the dueling leaders three wide
and weakened late. THE TWINS SNEAKERS far behind early, offered some late energy reducing the margin. MY BOSS LADY dropped back early racing
wide and was never a factor. CARTIER CAT chased in midpack and flattened out along inside through the stretch. LOOK OUT LAMBO dropped far behind
then caught tiring rivals. RUNNINGFORHOME saved ground well off the pace and lacked a response. CATCH MY VIBE dropped back early, was urged on
the final turn but faltered. HIDE THE RANSOM set a pressured pace for five furlongs and stopped. TEEWINOT PASS steadied just after the start and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
TIME TO CRUISE stalked the pace three wide, vied through the final turn, was collared and lost lead briefly in midstretch then battled back and got the nod.
IN SPADES fanned wide early, angled inside on the final turn, moved back out, rallied, led narrowly but was outdueled. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK dueled in
the two path then inside and weakened in the final furlong. AHSAD forced the pace inside to the final turn and finished willingly. HASTEN THENCE chased
off the pace between rivals and lacked closing bid. CORKMAN trailed early outside then passed fading rivals. LEMON CREEK LOUIE lacked speed, chased
extremely wide on the final turn and was no factor. BRETT'S WORLD rated just off the leaders four wide and began fading on the final turn. FAST BOB
flashed speed briefly then gave way readily. KEITHSENDSHELLOOOO saved ground throughout and never offered a response.
