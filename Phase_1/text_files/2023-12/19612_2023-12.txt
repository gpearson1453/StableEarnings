Footnotes
FORBIDDEN KINGDOM stepped to the front and set the pace in hand while under pressure from DANCING BUCK, headed by that rival on the turn, inched
ahead in upper stretch, maintained a short lead into deep stretch and held gamely. DANCING BUCK broke well and prompted the pace from outside,
headed FORBIDDEN KINGDOM on the turn, kept the pressure on through the lane and could not summon the needed late kick to get by the winner. TURN
ON THE JETS (IRE) broke alertly then took a stalking position outside a rival, rounded the bend in the two path, chased within striking distance through the
final furlong but lacked the needed late response while holding third. DANIEL'S MAGIC also broke alertly and moved inside stalking the top pair, saved
ground through the turn, roused leaving the bend and finished evenly along the fence. I'M A GAMBLER (IRE) chased in the two path and could not produce
a bid when called upon. BALNIKHOV (IRE) broke a step slow, traveled near the back outside a rival then between foes, took the turn two wide, kept to task
in the final furlong and improved position. LUCKY SCORE located towards the rear early on the inside, ran into traffic briefly at the quarter pole, angled out
in the lane and offered a mild rally. TAHOE SUNRISE raced in range early outside rivals, coaxed along three wide on the bend, put to left handed urging
with a furlong remaining but weakened in the late stages. JOHNNY PODRES tracked three deep early, spun four wide into the lane, moved out in the lane
and failed to threaten. FRONT RUN THE FED broke a step slow, trailed early then went outside rivals, rounded the bend three deep, found traffic in the lane
and could not threaten. OLYMPIC RUNNER settled four deep, navigated the turn five wide, bothered by JOHNNY PODRES at the eighth pole and failed to
menace. PEACEFUL WATERS broke a step slow, chased keenly early when rating inside out of range, saved ground through the turn, weakened in the
drive, eased in deep stretch and walked off. Due to a timing malfunction, the three-quarter fractional time on video is incorrect.

GRAND TIGER dueled inside THE GIANTS CANDY into and around the turn, inched ahead in upper stretch and held gamely to the wire. THE GIANTS
CANDY dueled outside GRAND TIGER, kept the pressure on through the lane and finished gamely in defeat. MONGOLIAN GOLD broke a step slow and
dropped back early, trailed two wide leaving the backstretch, moved to the rail to save ground, came with a late run along the fence and gained third. KING
ZOG chased the top pair on the inside into the turn, moved out and loomed three wide into the lane and lacked the needed late kick in the furlong grounds.
BLUEGRASS RYDER lacked early speed despite being coaxed along, traveled along the rail then angled out and came four wide into the drive and failed to
threaten. VENOM chased in range for a bit then started to lose ground leaving the backstretch, dropped back to last while three wide on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
ANGEL NADESHIKO established the front and crossed to the inside, controlled the pace through the early going, met the bid from REBEL GIRL on the far
turn, roused exiting the bend and put that rival away at the top of the stretch, asked right handed midstretch and held well. LAKOTA SPIRIT stalked along
the rail, cut the corner into the stretch, chased within striking range under right handed urging but could only whittle the gap on the winner late. OAKHURST
settled in the two path, ridden along on the second bend, moved out in the drive and edged YERWANTHERE (IRE) for the show honors. YERWANTHERE
(IRE) trailed two wide then moved inside on the clubhouse turn, chased off the rail at the back in the middle stages, angled back to the rail on the far turn,
tipped three wide past the quarter pole, kept on trying through the lane but could not get by OAKHURST for third. REBEL GIRL closest in pursuit in the two
path, raced up close from outside in the middle stages, challenged the winner around the far turn, failed to kick on with that rival at the top of the lane and
flattened in the late stages. LUMINIFEROUS raced in range in the three path, came four wide into the drive and weakened.

Footnotes
DIRECT LINE dueled for the lead from outside, took control in the middle stages, cleared inner rival on the far turn, asked right handed past the eight pole
and inched away in deep stretch. GOOD JUJU dueled inside DIRECT LINE into the first turn then inched ahead around the bend, lost command on the
backstretch but continued to fight on from inside, lost contact with DIRECT LINE midway around the far turn, churned on from inside into and down the lane
and proved second best. ZIMBA WARRIOR stalked in the three path early, chased three deep on the far turn, kept trying down the lane to hold third but was
unable to threaten the top pair. BIG BUZZ chased at the back on the inside into the first turn then shifted to the two path, raced four deep through the far
turn and could not rally. SETTECENTO stalked next to the rail in the beginning, went two wide and between rivals on the far turn and failed to offer a bid.

Footnotes
QUICK KATE stalked along the fence inside a rival, drew closer leaving the backstretch, tipped out to take aim from the two path on the far turn, drew
alongside LAMPOGHINI at the eighth pole and proved best late. LAMPORGHINI took control early and steered to the rail while under pressure, cleared on
the backstretch, asked right handed leaving the far turn, challenged by QUICK KATE with a furlong remaining, resist into deep stretch but succumbed to the
pressure late. SNEAKER sat off the pace three wide, gained two wide then along the inside on the far turn but flattened in the final furlong. O K ROSE
stalked two wide outside a rival, went between foes at the quarter pole, tipped out into the stretch and lacked a bid. BE A GOLDFISH trailed two wide then
moved inside, saved ground through the far turn and failed to make an impact. ALMOST GOT LUCKY pressed from outside early, stalked the leader in the
middle stages, chased two then three wide on the far turn and faded.

DEL MAR JERRY coaxed from the gate and vied inside rivals into the first turn then cleared around the bend, was a bit keen controlling the pace into the
backstretch, drew away on the far turn, padded the lead in upper stretch and remained well clear under urging. DUAL THREAT chased four wide on the
clubhouse turn, remained widest through the second bend and outdueled HONDO CROUCH for second. HONDO CROUCH vied three deep into the first
turn then dropped back to chase in the three path, remained three wide and outside rivals on the far turn, bumped with BENDETTIJOE in upper stretch,
churned on down the lane and was outfinished for the place. BENDETTIJOE showed early speed between rivals then chased after the leader on the
clubhouse turn in the two path, ridden along between rivals around the far turn, bumped with HONDO CROUCH in upper stretch and weakened. QUINCY
MARKET became fractious behind the gate and took a few tries to get loaded in, came away well and was up close four deep into the first turn then dropped

could not keep up with the winner in the final furlong but proved second best. AUDIBLE SILENCE forwardly placed inside rivals, saved ground through the
turn, needed to find more go on with the top pair in the final furlong but churned on to earn the show honors. SMILING JOJO sped clear and set the pace up
the backstretch, led along the rail then two wide into the stretch, lost command at the three-sixteenths pole and flattened to fourth. MR. CHIVAS coaxed
from the gate, chased along the inside and cut the corner into the lane but lacked the needed response. MISCHIEVOUS DYLAN broke well and raced up
close early then chased three deep into the turn, spun four wide into the lane and weakened. POLIS bumped with inner rival leaving the gate, traveled out of
range off the inside, rounded the turn three deep and weakened. NAUKANAUKA had to take up with crowded shortly after the start, was rank while chasing
off the inside, went between foes on the turn and weakened in the stretch. LETSHAVEONEMORE broke a step slow, trailed three to four wide and made no
impact. SUNSET STORM settled widest early, traveled four deep around the bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
GET THE GOLD stalked along the rail, remained patiently ridden saving ground on the far turn, gained an opening between the top pair and burst through at
the eighth pole and won going away. MAXVILLE saved ground on the inside near the back, moved out a bit in the lane and rallied between rivals to get up
for second. GHOSTLY ACT back bobbled and took a light bump at the start but still came away unaffected and on the front end, closest in pursuit around
the first turn then went up to apply pressure in the middle stages, dueled around the far turn, took over in upper stretch, lost command past the eighth pole
and was edged for the place honors. ANTIBES grabbed the early lead and set the pace from inside, took pressure from GHOSTLY ACT in the middle
stages, dueled on the last turn, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and faltered late. BERT'S PROSPECT hit the gate and bumped inner rival at the start,
was taken back shortly after and moved inside, went three then four wide on the far turn and could not rally. DARK MARCUS tracked in the two path, along
the inside into the far turn, moved out and went three wide into the stretch, chased between in deep stretch and also failed to rally. BE PUNCTUAL raced up
close three deep then took a stalking position in the two path, came off the final turn three wide and could not offer a response when asked. TOPPERS
WAGER settled off the pace in the two path, got shuffled between rivals at the three-eighths pole, was ridden along on the far turn then asked right handed
at the quarter pole, came up empty and was eased in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LANSDOWNE (GB) chased the leader outside a rival to the turn, challenged around the bend, dueled with FEROCIOUSLY down the lane and dug in late to
edge the runner-up. FEROCIOUSLY set the pace off the inside up the backstretch then moved in for the turn, met the bid from LANSDOWNE (GB) at the
three-eighths pole, held a short lead two wide into the lane, battled through the stretch and yielded grudgingly. ELEVADO climbed a bit early giving chase,
rounded the bend two wide and went between rivals, cut the corner into the stretch, rallied along the fence and finished a game third. CURLY ESA traveled
in mid-pack off the rail then between rivals, angled out and came four wide into the stretch but lacked the needed rally in the furlong grounds. TENTH
STREET DON broke in a bit and brushed rival to come away a step slow, traveled three deep at the back then drew closer leaving the backstretch, went
three wide into the turn, exited five wide and also lacked a rally. MAGNIFICENT RIDE bobbled leaving the gate, raced in range up the backstretch,
navigated the turn three to four wide and weakened. BIG SPLASH got brushed by outer rival at the start, checked off heels at the nine-sixteenths pole, took
the turn four wide and failed to make an impact. MUHAMMAD ALI (PER) dropped back early, trailed two wide then along the rail and was not a factor. HOT
MEMORIES sat off the pace, saved ground through the turn and failed to menace. CONCH DADDY forward placed on the inside, lost ground around the
turn, came off the rail in the drive and faded.
