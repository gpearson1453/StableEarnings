Footnotes
VAMONOS PIACENTE quick to begin to set an uncontested early pace and drew off the through the stretch run under a strong hand ride. CABARET
FLEUR tracked the early leader from the inside, angled out into the upper stretch to take aim but was no match for the winner in the drive. A P'S RUNAWAY
DIVA void of early speed, swung six to seven wide into the lane and closed in mildly. UNEXPECTEDVALENTYN dropped back off the early pace setters,
saved ground and lacked a bid. GEMSHINE chased the early pace, raced near the inside past the five sixteenths pole, angled out and was empty in the
drive.

Footnotes
SUPPLY CHAIN rated along the inside under a firm hold down the backstretch, moved up two wide from the outside of Cumber to challenge near the
quarter pole and drew off to be clear under steady handling. SHELL FIRE dropped back to race mid pack early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole,
shifted out four wide in the drive and finished gamely late to narrowly get up for the place position. DISTORTED LIMITS stalked the pace, raced near the rail
around the far turn through the stretch and kept on willingly to the wire. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU stalked the pace two deep and weakened through the
stretch run. CUMBER was coaxed along to a clear early lead, was met nearing the quarter pole by Supply Chain and faded in the drive. IT'S FATE was void
of early speed and never was a factor. ADIOS BOBBY raced five wide around the first turn, lost ground to race far back and never menaced.

Footnotes
GO GIRL showed good early speed to set the early pace along the inside and held well to be clear late under steady pressure. I'M JAC'D tracked the early
leader from the inside down the backstretch around the far turn, shifted three wide into the upper stretch to race from the outside of Go Girl but couldn't get
by in a game effort. WEEKENDING was under a hard chase two deep and weakened a bit through the drive. C MORE PRIDE was off slowly, moved up
along the inside around the far turn into the upper lane and flattened out. TV TIZ GORGEOUS dropped back off the early pace set, raced two to three wide
and lacked a bid. TITEBLUEJEANS was mid pack early on, swung five wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. ONE RICH KITTEN settled off the
early going, raced three to five wide around the far turn and had no response.

CONFESSOR stalked the pace, moved up to take aim near the three sixteenths pole five deep, shifted in through the stretch run and drew off to be clear
under strong encouragement. ORO DE MORO MORO pressed the early leader two deep from the outside, had command into the far turn, dug in and gave
way grudgingly to the winner late. APPRAISAL pressed the early pace from the outside of rivals down the backstretch, raced three wide between in the
stretch run and kept on willingly to the wire. CUGINE dropped back early on, ridden four deep from the outside near the three eighths pole, raced six wide
into the upper stretch and was even late with no closing run. DISCLOSURE raced off the early going, was three to four wide around the far turn and never
threatened. THE HONORABLE ONE settled off the early pace setters, raced three wide between near the quarter pole and had no response. INDIAN

handling. OUT OF CENTS stalked the pace, raced near the inside around the far turn, eased out into the upper lane and finished gamely to the wire.
FREEDOM RIDER dropped back to race mid pack, made a three to two wide bid in the lane and finished willingly to the wire. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT dropped
back off the early going, swung six to seven wide into the upper stretch and flattened out with no final winning bid. DOCTOR WU raced near the inside past
the five sixteenths pole, angled out through the upper lane and raced evenly in the drive. STATESBORO void of early speed, shifted in nearing the three
sixteenths pole, angled back out near the eighth and closed in belatedly from the far outside. PATIO PARTY was forwardly place along the inside and

while being kept to pressure. FLAXEN dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch but was no match for the winner in the drive. AWILDAS
TREASURE pressed the early pace between rivals, raced three deep in the drive and kept on to secure third place finish. GIRLINTHEFIREPLACE stalked
the pace from the outside, raced three to five wide and raced evenly with closing run. GRAN CHEMIN was squeezed back at the break, raced three wide
and never was a factor. SHE IS ROYALTY lag early on to trail, swung wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. POLISHED GEM pressed the early
going from the inside and tired readily.

Footnotes
CREDIT RIVER showed good early speed along the inside to set the early pace and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. AQUITANIA ARRIVAL
tracked the early leader two deep from the outside of Credit River and kept on gamely to the wire. R CARDINAL PRINCE stalked the pace, raced near the
inside at the quarter pole, angled out and finished willingly to the wire. AGNELLO'S DREAM dropped back to race mid pack, was two to three wide in the
drive and raced evenly to the wire. GOING IN STYLE raced five wide around the first turn, pulling hard early from the outside of foes and faded in the stretch
run. CENTSOFWANDER settled early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no response. STAR ENTERTAINER fanned six wide around
the first turn, raced off the early pace, saved ground into the upper stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
SPENCER'S BOY LUNA raced at the back of the pack, made a strong bid around far turn, circled the field five wide and edged clear late under strong
handling. COUTH stalked the pace, raced two wide near the quarter pole, dug in from the inside in the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. ERNIE'S
MARTINI stalked the pace, moved up four to five wide into the upper stretch and flattened out. GOODBYELLOWBRICKRD was forwardly placed to lay up
closed early, was three deep near the quarter pole and weakened while racing from the outside. STOP THE SPREAD pressed the early pace between rivals
down the backstretch and faded. STIRDATPOT showed good early foot from the inside and gave way.
