Footnotes
TOO MUCH KIKI stalked leaders in the early going, moved up around the turn, entered the stretch four wide and proved the best late. NANA'S CORN
MUFFIN vied for the early advantage, dueled throughout, was outfinished by the winner, but proved best of others. AMERICAN TSUNAMI challenged on the
front end, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the top two, but outfinished CONVALIDATION for show. CONVALIDATION showed early
speed, raced close throughout and was outfinished for third. KATIES SPIRIT void of early speed and was never a factor. TRUE PRINCESS raced evenly
near the back and showed little. WARM FUZZIES pressed the early pace, dropped back and was outrun.

Footnotes
NATE'S REVENGE void of early speed, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a wide bid and got up late. STEPHEN'S ANSWER vied on the
front end, drove clear down the backside, led until the wire, couldn't hold off a late running NATE'S REVENGE for the win. APPLEWOOD raced in the back
of the pack in the beginning, moved up between rivals around the final turn, made a late rail bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. BIG
ROJO raced near the middle of the field, made a bid and hung. SILVER N LAI raced in the middle of the pack, moved up, within striking distance, faded and
finished evenly. FREEDOMFI lacked early speed, raced outside around the first turn, moved up, before weakening and was no real factor. WEDINGTON
pressed the early pace, dropped back and finished evenly near the back. HONORARIAN dueled on the front end, retreated and was outrun. ALYANAABI
had a tight start, rushed up, challenged on the front end, dropped back and was outrun.

Footnotes
SADIE'S LIGHT unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out, entered the stretch five wide and drove clear before
the wire. CPRIORITY pressed the pace, raced close throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but held on for second. JEFFROW lacked early
speed, raced outside around the first turn, made a late wide bid and was outfinished for second. SEEHOSS went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and
lacked a finish. HEARTTHROB HALO pressed the early pace, raced close throughout the early going and weakened down the home stretch. BOY
CHARLIE raced evenly near the back, came around the final turn wide and was never a factor. BET AGAIN raced within striking distance, dropped back and
was outrun. FLASHY PREMO trailed throughout and was distanced.

Footnotes
FLYING I challenged for the early lead, took command around the turn, drove clear and won under steady urging. GEMMY pressed the pace, forwardly
placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. SCRAPPY raced within contention, saved ground around the turn, made a mild
bid, and proved no match for the top two. CHUCHI had a tight start, racing in the back, showed late interest, but was no real factor. WHORL GIRL vied for
the early lead, saved ground and faded. DREAMED I AM FAST raced near the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. TENSAS
CLEAR raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. HEY YOU always raced near the back, finished wide and showed little. ADAYINSPAIN raced in
the middle of the pack, blew the turn and was no threat late. ST. FRANCIS OF LA. raced within striking distance, dropped back and was outrun.
