Footnotes
MAUNA KEA BOUND prompted the pace in the four path, bid under confident handling around the turn, was coaxed from the five path into the lane, took
the lead before the eighth pole, and drew clear in the final sixteenth. HEY RIVER set the pace in the two path, was roused into the turn, faced an outer
challenger while floating out to the four path turning into the stretch, lost the lead before the eighth pole, but kept on for place. TOP MAVERICK got pinched
back at the start, trailed in the six path, shifted inside early into the turn, angled back out to the six path at the top of the lane, and chased on for show.
ADIOS PAPA CHICO broke out an bumped an outer foe, chased in the five path, floated out to the eight path under a heavy drive turning into the stretch,
and weakened. SMOKE WAGON bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the six path early but never menaced.

HEALS THE SOUL vied two wide, kicked clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. FROSTED FAITH stalked the pace three wide, bid in upper
stretch but was clearly second best late. MARLEY LUCK hit the starting gate, chased the pace four wide, lacked the needed rally but won the battle for the
show. EXCHANGE DAY dueled inside of the winner, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. TIZ A PRINCE was bumped at the start, raced off
the pace wide and had a mild belated rally. KINGPIN raced up close early, checked nearing the turn, saved ground around the bend and had no further
bids. OFFICER COUNTRY was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. UNSOCIABLE failed to menace while racing four wide.
DAZZLING TRUTHS was bumped at the start and trailed throughout.

THETHRILLOFVICTORY stalked in the two path, bid inside of rivals going into the far turn, took the lead passing the three-eighths, was cued from the five
path into the lane, and drew clear. MEDIA SENSATION rated in the three path, was ridden between foes in the two path turning into the stretch, and kept on
for place. NO REGARD chased in the four path, was driven in the five path around the far turn, swung out to the seven path turning into the lane, and
finished evenly for show. VARIABLE COST (GB) laid up close in the four path, was coaxed passing the three-eighths, but flattened from the five path in the
stretch. LITTLE STEVEN set the pace in the three path, but lost the lead to the inner eventual winner and was under coaxing early around the far turn, and
yielded in the stretch. BELLY OF JELLY raced off the pace in the two path, was driven from the rail around the far turn and into the stretch, but came up
empty. WEDNESDAYNIGHT LAD dwelt and completely missed the start, was pulled up leaving the first turn, and walked off. NO CHANGES WERE MADE
AFTER THE STEWARDS HELD AN INQUIRY TO DETERMINE IF WEDNESDAYNIGHT LAD HAD A FAIR START.

LUCY'S COOKIE set a clear pace in the two path, drifted out significantly under right-handed urging in upper stretch, straightened out and angled back
when taken in hand near the sixteenth pole and steadily widened throughout it all. ISAYSO chased the winner in the clear in the three path and was clearly
second best. INABLINK raced off the pace two wide, angled five wide near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and was along for the
show. MOBAY PRINCESS chased the pace inside and lacked a rally. NO VIOLENCE failed to menace while racing four and five wide. ORO ORO played
no factor while racing two wide. MO TWILIGHT gave distant chase three wide and came up empty in the lane. OYA THUNDER was outrun while racing four
wide.

MAPTITUDE vied for the lead in the three path, was roused between foes in the two path going into the turn, tipped out to the three path entering the
stretch, and ran on to draw past an outer foe around the sixteenth. UNIKEE had his head turned at the start, stalked in the five path, bid four wide passing
the three-eighths pole, took command passing the quarter, floated out to the six path under rousing turning into the lane, but faded in the final sixteenth to
place. AUSTONIAN pressed inside of foes from the two path, was urged along the rail turning into the stretch, and was one paced for show. PRACTIKO had
his head turned at the start, tracked in the three path, was coaxed in the four path midway around the turn, fanned out to the seven path turning into the
stretch, but failed to bid. MOONSTRIKE (GB) trailed in the six path early and never threatened. MIDNIGHT ONYX dueled for the lead in the four path but
yielded between foes turning into the lane.
