BAD SNEAKERS took control early from inside then two wide on the clubhouse turn, cleared briefly on the backstretch then dueled into the far turn, lost
command late on the bend, regained command at the top of the stretch, vied with rivals to midstretch, dueled with DURAN in the final furlong and gamely
prevailed. DURAN forwardly placed four wide early, ridden along three deep on the second bend, bid three deep upper stretch, dueled outside BAD
SNEAKERS in the final furlong but lacked the needed late kick to get by. RIVERSIDE stalked between rivals, worked on two to three wide on the far turn,
got hemmed in and lacked room at the three-sixteenths pole, altered to the outside and kept on for the show honors. CITY OF ANGELS stalked three deep
around the first turn, went three wide into the second bend, angled five wide into the stretch and finished evenly while picking up a minor award. PLAYER B
pressed the pace from outside in the three path early, lost touch for a bit on the backstretch then drew alongside the leader again, dueled into and around
the far turn, took over late on the bend, lost command at the top of the stretch, fought between rivals to midstretch, then weakened in the final furlong.
PRECISION STRIKE stalked from inside, hugged the rail to the stretch and weakened.

HANDSOME TICKET vied for the lead from inside, inched ahead around the bend and led two to three wide into the lane, shook free in upper stretch and
drew off while kept to task in the final furlong. MOBE TOWN vied between rivals, got put in a bit tight briefly at the five-sixteenths pole, chased three wide
into the lane and edged inner rival for second. ADVENTURESOME stalked from inside, coaxed along through the turn, asked right handed into the lane,
switch to the left hand in upper stretch then switched back to right handed encouragement and got outkicked for the place honors. HOT LEGS ROMOLO
vied three deep into and around the bend, fought four wide into the drive, failed to kick on with the winner in upper stretch and weakened. CLASSICAL
chased in the two path outside a rival, moved out in the lane, drifted back inside and flattened out. STREETLIGHT PEOPLE bumped with inner rival at the
start, chased out of range, saved ground through the turn and proved no menace. RUNNING FOR COSI bumped leaving the gate, lagged behind early,
trailed two to three wide on the turn and was never a factor. C'MON LETS SWITCH chased four then five wide around the bend and came up empty.

approaching the nine-sixteenths pole, opened up on the turn, held a diminished lead two wide into the lane, lost command near the three-sixteenths pole
and weakened in the furlong grounds. CON SEAL AND KERRY broke in, tracked four wide into the turn, four deep at the three-eighths pole, spun five wide
into the lane and failed to threaten while earning a minor award. JORDAN chased in the four path into the turn, six wide turning for home and lacked a rally.
ROPERS N WRANGLERS broke in and brushed, chased between then off the rail, three, four then five wide on the turn and failed to respond to urging.
CORPORAL VIOLETTE (IRE) stumbled at the start, trailed two wide into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend and proved no menace. LADY WOLF
bumped leaving the gate, dueled briefly from inside then chased the leader up the backstretch, brushed outer rival at the three-eighths pole and tired down
the lane.

trailed early, rounded the bend three then two wide, rallied in the drive and got up for second. TAPIT DOUX chased off the rail then moved inside, steered
out in the lane, failed to summon the needed late kick to threaten the winner and lost the place. ROCK N ROLL SONG chased three deep early then
between rivals, went two wide into the turn, four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. RED NOON RISING chased from inside off the pace, trailed into the
lane, moved out upper stretch and failed to make an impact. DAISY DANCER chased four then three deep on the backstretch, navigated the turn three then
four wide and lacked further response. FLAT OUT JOY fractious in the gate, chased three wide into the turn, angled to the inside around the bend and

Footnotes
BEAU SOLEIL got pinballed leaving the gate, chased from well off the pace, went two to three wide around the bend, flew late and drove past the runner-up
in the closing moments. BEER MONEY bumped outer rivals leaving the gate, vied inside several rivals then dueled leaving the backstretch, carried a short
lead over outer rival through the turn, battled into the final furlong, cleared with a sixteenth remaining but got nailed near the wire. DES DOIGTS veered in
and bumped rival shortly after the start, vied between rivals for command then dueled outside BEER MONEY, fought two wide through the bend, kept the
pressure on into the furlong grounds but faltered in deep stretch. FACT OR FICTION tracked five wide through the turn and whittle the gap on the leaders
late. PAVEL PUFF vied three deep early then chased the top pair past the half-mile pole, rounded the bend in the three path and lacked a rally. HALO
UNCLE vied four deep early then chased up the backstretch, angled over to the rail on the turn and failed to produce a bid. WICKED FACTS raced up close
five deep then chased four wide into the turn, remained wide into the lane and weakened. MR. SUDS bumped with inner rival and took up at the start and
never got involved after. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INVOLVING SEVERAL RIVALS AT THE START. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE
STEWARDS RULED THAT NO PLACINGS WERE AFFECTED AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

LOW EXPECTATIONS pressed from outside early, dueled into and around the far turn, fought four wide into the lane, drifted in and bumped BRIGHT LEAF
past the eighth pole and dug in late to best that rival. BRIGHT LEAF chased three then two wide early, inched closer on the far turn, bid from inside leaving
the far turn, drifted off the fence, bumped with LOW EXPECTATIONS past the eighth pole, finished gamely to the wire but was edged by the winner.
SHORTMAN bumped with outer rival at the start, climbed a bit early, trailed two wide around the first turn, navigated the far turn four then five wide and
rallied for the show honors. COWBOY MIKE forwardly placed in the three then four wide, stalked the dueling pair to the far turn, bid three deep late on the
bend, became a bit rank into the lane, raced erratically again midstretch and kept on to miss the show. CAISSON broke in and bumped SHORTMAN at the
start, chased three wide early, two to three wide on the second bend and lacked a rally. MISCHELOF (CHI) took control from inside, dueled into and around
the far turn, fought two wide into the lane and weakened. IMPOSSIBLE TASK forwardly placed five wide, remained wide on the far turn and chased seven
wide turning for home, then weakened in the lane. DEVIL BE ME chased four deep around the clubhouse turn, four to five wide on the far turn, got crowded
between rivals midstretch and weakened. THE RIDER ABOARD BRIGHT LEAF LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST LOW EXPECTATIONS AND THERE
WAS ALSO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE SAME INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT
BOTH RIVALS CONTRIBUTED TO THE BUMPING PAST THE EIGHTH POLE AND NO CHANGE WOULD BE MADE.

STOLEN TREASURE cleared from outside and crossed over, showed the way up the backstretch, pressured by LAST CALL LONDON early on the turn,
maintained a short lead along the rail and two wide into the stretch, battled head to head through the lane and yielded grudgingly. MICI'S EXPRESS chased
between at the back, two to three wide on the far turn, could not summon the needed rally down the stretch but outfinished STAY ON THE FENCE for the
show honors. STAY ON THE FENCE rated in the two path, chased along the rail into the far turn, roused approaching the five-sixteenths pole, failed to
showed the needed response threaten the top pair and got outkicked by MICI'S EXPRESS for third. GENTLEMEN'S CLUB tucked inside at the back,
chased two wide leaving the backstretch then moved back to the rail, saved ground to the stretch and weakened. CLEVER CLOVER broke out and brushed
rival, chased four wide through the clubhouse turn, three then four wide on the second bend and weakened down the lane. SIZE DOES MATTER hit the
gate and broke a step slow, traveled three deep at the back early, chased outside a rival three wide leaving the backstretch, rounded the second bend two
then three wide and could not rally.
