Footnotes
HARI broke inwardly and bumped BULLETONTHECHARTS into BARRY THE BUILDER, raced off the pace two wide between foes, angled four wide
turning for home, tried to lug in throughout the stretch run, rallied outside and was up in deep stretch. JOINT RESOLUTION checked nearing the first turn,
raced two wide in midpack around that bend, edged closer at the rail around the far turn, angled three wide in midstretch, rallied between foes and was
narrowly outkicked. MR BRIZEL had early speed inside, stalked inside down the backstretch, angled three wide midway around the far turn, moved to the
front leaving the eighth pole, briefly drew clear but was overhauled in deep stretch. BARRY THE BUILDER was knocked sideways at the start, raced off the
pace at the rail, steadied off heels near the quarter pole, tipped out in upper stretch and had a mild rally between rivals. CARSOWN stalked the pace three
wide around the first turn, bid two wide nearing the five-sixteenths marker, led from there to midstretch and weakened through the final furlong. MOTOWN
PUNK raced in range three wide and lacked the needed rally. ASSERTIVE ATTITUDE saved ground and failed to menace. HIGH STAKES was off a step
slowly, raced well back inside, swung five wide in upper stretch and never threatened. CHROMOTION was bumped soon after the start, raced four wide
around both turns and never threatened. BULLETONTHECHARTS was bumped hard on both sides at the start, raced two and three wide and was never in
contention. TIZADUKE set the pace two wide around the first turn and gave way midway around the far turn. BILLY PRICE steadied entering the first turn,
raced in range two wide, stopped around the far turn and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
ANAJULIAFOREVER stalked in the three path, tipped out to the five path to bid under coaxing entering the stretch, switched leads passing the eighth pole,
took the lead before the sixteenth, and safely held off an outer foe late. MIGUEL'S BELLE laid up close along the rail, received right handed cues inside of
rivals around the turn, swung out to the six path at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. KOZEM chased in the four path, was carried out to the eight
path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. SPECIAL AFFAIR trailed while shifting into the two path going into the turn, was ridden around the turn,
tipped out to the three path passing the eighth pole, and mildly stayed on. SWEET MISS had an awkward start, tracked in the two path, was floated out to
the seven path turning into the lane, and made no impact. HEAVEN IN MIND set the pace in the two path, dug in while floating out to the three path turning
into the lane, but weakened through the final sixteenth. JUST TAKE NOTES rated in the three path, steadied slightly while being fanned out to the nine path
turning into the stretch, and did not threaten.

Footnotes
MONEY FACTOR raced off the pace in the three path, ranged up under a ride in the five path early around the far turn, bid from the six path turning into the
lane, dueled with an inner foe down the lane, and prevailed. CURRENT SITUATION laid in range in the four path, was roused to bid early into the far turn,
took the lead midway around the far turn, was challenged by an outer foe while floating out to the five path turning into the stretch, and dug in, but yielded
late to place. SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT stalked in the two path, was roused into the far turn, shifted out to the six path turning into the stretch and finished
evenly for show. KATIESDREAMGIRL trailed in the three path, circled tiring rivals from the five path around the far turn, fanned out to the eight path at the
top of the lane, but made no impact. WINNING AT EASE rated from the rail, tipped out to the five path under a drive turning into the stretch, but weakened.
RUNAWAY BREEZE chased in the five path, was ridden from the three path into the far turn, but never threatened. RADIANT GEM set the pace in the three
path but gaveway in the two path turning into the lane. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS tracked in the six path but never menaced.

not keep pace nearing the quarter pole and held well enough for the show. BEAUTIFULLYPERFECT saved ground and failed to menace. LUNETTA JAK
head her head turned at the start, saved ground off the pace and never threatened. MOCHI GIRL was bumped at the start, raced four wide and had no bids.
NOUVEAU RICHE was outrun while racing three wide. DREAM DIAMOND bumped at the start then had only brief speed two wide. DADDY'S PIGEON

Footnotes
REZASROLEX set the pace in the three path, faced an outer challenger while tipping out to the four path under coaxing going into the stretch, dug in but
lost the lead passing the sixteenth, exchanged a couple of bumps with an outer foe late, and battled back to get back up in the final strides. TAPIT THREE
TIMES stalked in the four path, was roused into the far turn, bid from the five path turning into the stretch, ran on to lead near the final sixteenth, but bumped
twice with an inner foe late, and hung to finish with place. MAGICSHADOW chased in the four path, angled out to the six path turning into the stretch, and
finished evenly for show. SEVERANCE tracked in the two path, was driven into the stretch, but flattened. TENTH MOUNTAIN rated in the five path, was
driven around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but did not threaten. SIEGEL (IRE) broke slowly, trailed in the three path and
never menaced. AFTER AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF TAPIT THREE TIMES AGAINST REZASROLEX FOR POTENENTIAL
INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL SIXTEENTH, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS INQUIRY, NO CHANGES WERE MADE

Footnotes
SILENT HEART pressed the pace in the three path, took over leaving the quarter pole and drew clear while steadily drifting out under right-handed urging.
BOURBON BOSS stalked the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and finished willingly to be clearly second best. CRASH THE GATE was
bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and was along for the show. FASTEST set a pressured pace in the two path and
weakened through the final furlong. OVERMARS chased the pace four wide and faded in the drive. CACIQUE ABARRIO saved ground and failed to
menace. BEE PLUS was bumped and checked at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. MUAZARAH chased the pace four and five wide and had
little left for the drive. WASAMATTAFOYOU trailed in the three path.

Footnotes
SIGRUN FAST BOY bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the two path, was driven thru an opening along the rail to take the lead midway around
the far turn, and kicked away in the two path down the lane under a drive. EMBOITE (IRE) prompted the pace in the five path, bid outside of foes midway
around the far turn, lost touch with the inner eventual winner turning into the lane, but kept on for place. CLASSIC MO TOWN set the pace in the four path,
lost the lead between foes midway around the far turn, tipped out to the six path entering the stretch, and finished evenly to show. KING SILVIO stalked in
the three path, bid between foes in the two path around the far turn, but faded from the three path in the final furlong. OPPOSITES ATTRACT bumped with
an outer foe at the start, tracked in the four path, was under urging in the three path turning into the lane, but flattened. TRUTH AND HONESTY rated in the
two path, was ridden around the far turn, had to steady passing the quarter, and did not factor. MEDIA SENSATION broke out at the start, raced off the
pace along the rail down the backstretch but never threatened. CHACHARERO had a slow start and always trailed around the six path.

FIONA'S MAGIC dueled two wide, shook clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. BOURBON BREEZE bumped with LINCOLN PARK soon after
the start, tracked the pace two wide, tipped three wide in upper stretch and kept on to gain the place. LINCOLN PARK was bumped soon after the start,
stalked the pace three wide, could not match strides in upper stretch but stayed on outside to gain the show. SWEET HAZELY was off a bit slowly, steadied
midway down the backstretch, saved ground in range, tipped two wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and was one-paced. QUIMICHIS dueled
inside of the winner and tired in the stretch. KISS had her head turned at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. CONTESSA'S SONG stumbled at
the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CUMBERLAND slowly broke out at the start, trailed around the two path, was cued going into the far turn, swung out to the four path at the top of the lane,
tipped to the three path passing the eighth pole, and surged between foes to be up in the closing stages, was pulled up on the gallop out and vanned off.
SONG ON THE RADIO broke out at the start, set the pace inside, was roused while tipping out to the three path into the stretch, ran on while drifting out in
the final furlong, and was caught late by a surging inner foe to place. FLAT TOP BOX stalked in the four path, bid between foes under coaxing around the
far turn, floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. BLIND EYE steadied along the inside early around the first turn, chased in
the two path, cut the corner turning into the lane, and finished evenly. FOR THE CHIEF got fractious in the gate, steadied between foes around the first turn,
raced in midpack in the three path, shifted out to the six path turning into the stretch, and made no impact. DON'T ANSWER steadied early around the first
turn, tracked in the two path, fanned out to the eight path entering the lane, and did not factor. SIXWILLBERICH raced off the pace in the four path, went
widest turning into the stretch, and did not threaten. HE'S A LUCKY GUY rated in the five path, ranged up early around the far turn, floated out to the seven
path entering the stretch, but faded. TRUSTME IAMADOCTOR pressed in the three path but gaveway down the lane.
