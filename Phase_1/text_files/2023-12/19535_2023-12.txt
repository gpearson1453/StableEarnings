on the final turn and gained place with some late energy. SO SOFTLY quickly sprinted away, was collared midway on the final turn and weakened. AMALFI
LADY dropped well behind then passed rivals without menacing. SUPER DUPER FLY saved ground off the leaders and was finished after half a mile.
STRATEGY QUEEN trailed far behind then caught fading rival late. BOHEMIA BABE flashed speed outside then stopped abruptly.

RATIFIED stalked the pace, chased three wide on the turn, rallied inside of AKNA in the final furlong and wore down that rival in the final yards after a long
drive. AKNA vied inside for the lead, shook free on the turn, drifted well off the inside, dug in gamely in the stretch run, dueled late and yielded grudgingly.
OLD HEAD vied three wide for the early lead, chased on the turn and rallied mildly outside in the lane. BUNNY BONUS chased inside and rallied mildly on
the rail in the stretch. CREATIVE COPY vied two wide for the lead, chased on the turn and weakened. KISSES FOR EMILY trailed the field and did not
factor. SO SWELL raced off the rail, off the pace, came four wide into the lane and failed to threaten.

well to gain the place. COUSIN ANDREW raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter inside, led in the stretch then tired. MISCHIEVOUS JUAN chased three
wide off the pace, faded on the turn then came again mildly. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE settled near the inside, was asked for run on the turn but faltered.
LAZARETTO sprinted clear in the opening quarter, was collared into the stretch and stopped. SATCHEL DE RITCHES was urged just off the leader in the
two path, bid closer on the turn then gave way.

BRAVO ZULU vied outside for the early lead, dueled two wide on the turn, then dueled with COLLIN'S GREY LADY past the furlong marker and edged
away late. COLLIN'S GREY LADY stalked close up outside, bid three wide on the turn, dueled with the winner in the stretch run, dug in gamely outside and
came up second best. PEARLS AND HEELS raced off the pace inside, rallied mildly on the rail in the stretch drive and got the nod for third. RUNNIN
REDBIRD trailed the field, moved up between rivals into the stretch, rallied mildly and just missed for the show spot. OUT DANCING was off slowly, raced
three wide off the pace, chased on the turn, rallied mildly outside and was outkicked for the minor awards. SIZZLING ROMA tracked on the inside, angled
out at the quarter pole, came four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. FLASHING DIAMOND was off slowly, raced off the pace between rivals, came five
wide into the stretch and faded. PONTIFFANY vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and gave way.

made a gradual late gain. GINGERS WISH trailed to the stretch, angled out and closed well too late. THEGODDESSOFSNAKES chased very wide off the
pace throughout and lacked a solid rally. ALWAYS MIA prompted the leader three wide to the stretch and faltered. WISHING ONA PRAYER was urged

Footnotes
THE KHOZAN ONE tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, rallied outside of MAGICNTHEMOONLIGHT in upper stretch, battled heads apart at the
sixteenth marker and wore down that rival to prevail. MAGICNTHEMOONLIGHT away alertly to set the pace racing with a clear lead, responded when
roused, dug in gamely inside of the winner in the final furlong and yielded grudgingly late. GEEBERT trailed the field, moved up at the quarter pole, angled
out and rallied mildly. VIOLENT TURBULENCE stalked outside, chased on the turn and tired.

YOUNG SQUIRE outrun early outside, advanced very wide, collared the pacesetter, bumped with that one and surged clear. COLD FEET hustled to the
front inside, widened on the turn, bumped with winner then weakened. MR. ROUNDTREE trailed far behind to the stretch and offered good late energy.
DARK TIMBER pressed the pacesetter down the backstretch then faded in the lane. BRONX BOYS dropped back inside and lacked a solid rally. SEA
TRIDENT settled off the leaders near the inside and began fading on the turn. DATHOSS rated just off the pace three wide and was finished after half mile.
