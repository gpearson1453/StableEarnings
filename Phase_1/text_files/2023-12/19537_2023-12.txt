Footnotes
SUMMERTIME PEPPERS sprinted to the lead then pulled away through the turn and proved best. TITANIUM DEAL was off the pace in the two path,
chased the leader home and was second best. MALADJUSTED MISFIT pressed the pace from the inside and was along for the show. FRAN'S STAR
prompted the pace from four wide early then fell back on the turn and tired. WICKED PUNCHES raced one paced throughout and was not a factor.
PUPPETEER showed no early speed and remained back. HIT THE BULLSEYE was void of speed and was always back. LEXINGTON RIVER was
reluctant to load, raced wide and was not a threat.

Footnotes
ROLL ON OUT rushed to the lead to set all the pace, was challenged around the final turn but came again to prevail. OUT MAKING TREBLE saved ground
while racing near the back down the backstretch then angled out to make a bid and moved between horses near the five sixteenths pole, tipped out to four
wide into upper stretch and made a late rally. ASTERN BANKER raced off the pace in the two path through the final turn then moved in to make a rail bid in
the stretch but was outfinished. LOVE A FIGHTER pressed the pace from the two path down the backstretch, engaged the leader around the final turn but
weakened. CAPTAINS COVE raced six wide around the first turn then tipped in to three wide and made a middle move to be off the pace down the
backstretch but lacked the late response in the drive. HULLINAHURRY raced five wide into the first turn then settled in the middle of the pack on the inside
but lacked a late response. EL MIC TIESUN was allowed to settle down the backstretch then moved between horses at the three sixteenths pole and was
closing but was too late. AWESOME CAJUN raced near the back, made a mild bid on the backstretch but failed to menace. WINGS OF GOLD was
unhurried around the first turn and remained back. NOBLE CONNECTION stalked the pace around the first turn and slowly retreated.

Footnotes
RING TWICE went to a pressured lead and was headed at the eighth pole but came again to prevail. MALIBU TOAST pressed the pace through the turn
and took a brief lead at the eighth pole, fought gamely to hold the place. MISS SHIPMAN tracked the leaders to the turn then made a three or four wide bid
on the turn for the late run but was not enough. EXPECT A DANCER vied for the lead from four wide to the turn then fell back slightly but came again in the
stretch while fighting gamely but missed the show. FIRE VISION vied for the lead from the inside to mid turn and weakened. BIG BEAUTY showed no early
speed but gave late effort in the stretch to improve position. BROKEN HEARTS BAY was void of speed while racing wide throughout and passed tired ones
in the stretch. HAMAZING LACE raced in the middle of the pack from the four path, made a mild bid into the stretch and faltered. HOPESHECANRUN raced
off the pace from two wide to the turn and dropped back. PSALM PRAYER broke through the gate prior to the start and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SHANKINSTINE stalked the pace from the two path to the top of the stretch then angled in and cruised home. R T'S D'ORO was forwardly placed from
three wide moved up around the final turn but was not match for the winner. MAKE YOUR DESTINY went to a clear lead to set the pace to the top of the
stretch, was overtaken in mid stretch and tired. SOULOLOGY settled in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then angled out to three wide around
the turn and moved out to five wide in the stretch for a late run but was not enough. IDE LIKE HAWAII raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch
then made a three wide bid on the turn but faltered. CHIEF KIMOSABI hopped leaving the gate then was unhurried around the first turn, advanced through
the final turn while racing four wide to improve position late. NINEJUANJUAN CALL raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the final turn to no
avail. TOOCAN DANCE tracked the leaders for a half while saving ground then retreated. ANGOLA VACATION was always back. PAC THE PULPIT raced
