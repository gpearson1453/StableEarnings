Footnotes
SAVANNAH'S HERE rushed up the rail to be off the pace going into the turn then cut the corner into the stretch and kept on to be up in the final yards.
CHACHA TO CATALINA pressed the pace from the two path through the turn then engaged the leader at the top of the stretch to take a brief lead but was
run down by the inside closer to be denied. RUN AWAY SAMARI showed no early speed but moved up the rail around the turn and followed the winner in
the stretch to be along for the show. GATSBY'S GIFT went to a challenged lead through the turn then fought gamely to mid stretch and tired. TROSKA
tracked the leaders on the backstretch then made a mild three wide bid on the turn but lacked a late response. BRIDLED UP trailed the field early then
made a four wide bid on the turn to improve position late. BOSTON BELLE was off the pace from between horses to the turn then gave way. APRIORITY
GIRL tracked the leaders from two wide to the turn then dropped back.

turn to improve position in the stretch drive. BELL PEPPER was allowed to settle on the inside down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final
turn and passed tiring rivals. PINTORA hopped leaving the gate but was rushed up between horse around the first turn and was in contention down the
backstretch but tired in the stretch drive. BYE BYE BIG BABY was off the pace while saving ground down the backstretch then retreated on the final turn.

late rally. COAL DANCER chased the leaders but was no match for the winner. BACK STREET BABY was void of the early speed, made a bid into the turn
but had to steady in the traffic but made a rebid in the stretch to improve her position. EVE EVE trailed the field and passed tired rivals. RT'S MYSTERY
LADY saved ground to no avail. FIVE LEAF CLOVER was off slow then rushed to contention to press the early pace but lost action into the turn and was
done.

Footnotes
VIEWING TRAIL saved ground throughout, made an inside bid on the turn and slipped through at the eighth pole and drew clear. ACELA EXPRESS stalked
the pace from three wide through the final turn and made a late run but was no match for the inside rival. OLD SCHOOL FLASH vied for the lead from
between horses to the three furlong marker then moved to engage the leader at the quarter pole, matched strides to the sixteenth pole but was outfinished
by the inside and outside closers. PIECE OF ME shot away from the gate to take a clear lead around the first turn then set the pace through the final turn
and was challenged in the stretch drive and tired. BROOKE'S ALL IN raced in the middle of the pace from two or three wide but didn't make a bid.
ABSOLUTELY MINDY was allowed to settle near the back and was never a factor. THAT YOU MARGARET trailed the field and was outrun. CALIFORNIA
CALI went five wide into the first turn then was allowed to settle down the backstretch but was never a threat.

LA TRESS GRAY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside down the backstretch, made a two wide bid on the turn to engage the leader and drew off in
the stretch. ITSNOTMYJOB went to a clear early lead on the backstretch then was engaged on the turn but couldn't fend off the outside rival but proved
second best. HOLY WAR chased the leader to the turn then moved up and went three wide into the stretch for a late run to be up for the third place money.
KNIGHTS SWORD raced off the pace from three wide to the turn then tipped in to the rail on the turn but was empty in the stretch. POINT OF VICTORY
showed no early speed then moved up going three wide at the three sixteenths pole but lacked the late kick needed. IRON LOTUS tracked the leaders from
two wide to the quarter pole and retreated. ESSENTIAL BELLA rushed up from four wide to be in contention around the turn but tired in the stretch.

KISSES prompted the pace for the first half then vied for the lead from two wide through the final turn but couldn't over take the leader and was a clear
second. COUSIN VICKIE raced in the middle of the pack from the inside down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn and kept on for the
show. PAYTON'S INDIAN raced off the pace from three wide to the top of the stretch and tired. EASY ACT was allowed to settle near the back and passed
tiring rivals. CAT B CAUSE raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail to the final turn and faded. AUNT JANA was always back. GRAEME'S DEAL

DONEGAL FACTOR broke outward then swerved back in but went five wide into the first turn, was rushed up to be off the pace on the backstretch from
three wide and moved up to make a bid going into the stretch and was up in the final jumps. CLASSIC BET pressed the pace from the inside then over took
the leader at the three sixteenths pole but dueled with an outside closer and gave way grudgingly. JOLLY TOMMY moved between horse at the half mile
marker to track the leaders through the final turn then moved out to three wide in upper stretch for the late run but was too late. UPTOWN SOCIAL roused to
a pressured lead to the three sixteenths and gave way. MAYFIELD STRONG raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground, made a mild bid on the
final turn and finished evenly. GOD'S GOLD was unhurried down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn to improve position. MR
MIDWAY raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground and dropped back on the backstretch. EL ORO (FR) was forced in and bumped with JOLLY
TOMMY on the first turn and had to steady, settled slightly leaving the turn then rushed to contention down the backstretch from four wide and tired on the
final turn.

Footnotes
DOUBLE THUNDER raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch from off the rail then made a bid going into the final turn to take the lead at the
quarter pole, drew clear at the top of the stretch and was kept to task. GETCHA stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch then angled out to
four wide going into the stretch for the late rally and proved second best. COOLCROSS went to the front to set the pace for the first half then was headed at
the quarter pole and fought gamely to mid stretch and weakened. UNFATHOMED raced off the pace from three wide down the backstretch then moved up
to engage the leader at the quarter pole and fought gamely to the top of the stretch and tired. MACHINEGUNPREACHER was unhurried around the first
turn then steadily advanced through the final turn then moved out to five wide in upper stretch but flattened out. WHISKEY'S GONE prompted the pace from
four wide around the first turn then tipped in to the two path down the backstretch and dropped back entering the final turn. MOTATAABEQ tracked the
leaders from the two path down the backstretch then was three wide on the final turn while falling back and failed to menace. U S NAVY CROSS was
always back. TAPPIN FORA DANCE raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then saved ground around the final turn but was not a threat.
HONOR MY SPEED had an awkward start then moved up slightly from three wide on the backstretch but was never a factor.
