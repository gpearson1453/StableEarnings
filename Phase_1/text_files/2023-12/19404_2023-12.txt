the lead, good effort. SCOOT ALONG bumped at the start, pressed pace to turn between horses, empty. WRECK IT RUBY raced along evenly with no
response from the turn. BAYTOWN BAMA GIRL never menaced throughout. NO BODY LOVES ME broke sharp outside, with pace three wide to the turn,
faltered. BELLA VALENTINA close up to the turn with nothing left in the stretch. NEXT DOT bothered start, off rail run throughout, faded back quickly.

Footnotes
COOPERSTOWN unhurried start, ran on wide into far turn, ran off much the best. HEAVY HITTER inside pace to far turn, overtaken into stretch, best of the
rest. REAPPLY good position with speed between horses to far turn held show. PERSUADE raced along evenly with no late kick in the stretch run.
DOUBLE GOLD never a real menace throughout only to improved position late. CATALINA MOON tracked leaders to far turn, could not go on in the stretch
run. VINO CALDO rushed outside, could not keep up throughout. CHEESESTEAK no speed outside while never a real factor. CALL EM KARL never a
factor throughout . SWAYBACK JACK steadied along into first turn, kept up to the half with nothing left going into the far turn and stretch run. CAMILAS
WARRIOR good sped to duel for a half but could not go on and dropped back readily. POUR IT NEAT antsy in the gate, lunged from the gate with no speed
throughout while far back and eased to the wire and walked off.

BEL ARIA raced between early lost position turn, rallied on in time with a game effort to the wire. DANSEUR D'ORO bumped start, inside run to turn, angled
out, split horses for place spot. YOU'RE AVOIDING ME bore out at the start, raced on to the turn to contend for third. BROADWAY BLAZE broke through
gate prestart, reloaded, rushed, good effort. VOW no speed to far turn, rallied along to improve position late. SISTER KISSES raced along evenly with no
response when needed. FRACING NASTY speed to the front, dueled to the stretch, gave in final eighth. MORNIN' BOSS dueled to the half and had a
steady fade in the stretch run. MISS FOXANN stayed close to the half with nothing left in the stretch run. RUM RUNNER READY never a menace
throughout.

Footnotes
KATHEEB sharp to the front, cleared off into far turn as much the best under stout handling to the wire with a sharp effort. SALTED CARMEL outside run
first turn and backstretch with a perfect spot throughout had clear run but not enough in the stretch run. PROMISSIO unhurried to far turn with enough to
rally for show spot. SHARON'S PRINCE good position, never far back raced along evenly no late kick. THE LOOK FACTOR raced along wide into first turn
and backstretch with good position unable to cut into the margin late. IMMORTAL LION outside position with nothing to show from the half. YOU'RE ON
MUTE was a bit tardy from the gate and failed to menace throughout. TRANSCENDENTAL close up pressing the leader to the half with no response.
UNREASONABLE had a steady fade throughout. MIDNIGHT AWARD rated close up for three quarters while saving ground and faded back readily.
