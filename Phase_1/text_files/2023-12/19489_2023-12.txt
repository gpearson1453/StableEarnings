THUNDERS ROCKNROLL was quick to the front, dueled to the half, responded well into the stretch and held sway to the wire. LAURA'S CHARM pressed
winner to turn, could not keep up in the stretch run and held the place spot. YES DAY slow start from inside, raced back to stretch along for show spot.
AALIYAH EZRI outside run to quarter pole, angled in stretch run while evenly. EKATI FLATTER bit tardy, take wide to the turn, flattened out in the stretch.
MS TEMPTATION never menaced from inside. LIVE IT UP was through early and dropped far back.

chased winner while no match, holding place spot. MOONLIT MAGIC inside run to the turn, split horses into stretch for show spot. SOUL HEIR saved
ground throughout to no avail while along evenly in stretch. CAUSE IMA ROSE no speed to the stretch with a run in the drive to improve. KATE'S
CONCERTO off rail trip to the stretch with no late response from there. PADDY GAL close up three wide to turn with nothing left in the stretch run.
BATTALIA off tardy from outside with little to show throughout. WORDS OF PRAISE through early, dropped back readily. BE MISS HATTIE raced between
horses to the turn, gave in readily stretch.

Footnotes
SWEET SWEETFANTASY raced an off rail run to far turn, ran on between horses through the stretch to prevail in a game effort. HEAVENLY RICH inside
trip stretch run in a good effort to the wire. EYES OF GOLD outside run into stretch while widest in the drive for show spot. BRIC A BRAC three wide run to
far turn close up, stayed on to the wire. ZAPPERA no speed to far turn, rallied on to cut the gap and improve late. WISH LIST tardy from gate, lagged back
to the stretch closed the gap late. VANISHED close up early, dueled to the stretch in tight late steadied hard. RIVIERE broke out at the start, inside run to
quarter pole, no factor. RESPECTIVE close up to the half with no late response from far turn. PARISIAN SPIRIT never a real factor throughout. NIKKI M P
outside rush to the front stayed to the half with nothing left.
