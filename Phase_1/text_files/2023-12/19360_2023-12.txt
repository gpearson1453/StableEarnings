Footnotes
BIG PRANKSTER broke very fast and went straight to the front then angled in early, showed the way down the backstretch, dictated terms in the two path
on the turn, responded well when shaken up in upper stretch and drew off under a very mild hand ride to win handily. LIBERTY CENTRAL was fractious
behind the gate and reluctant to load, bumped with a foe at the start, chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was driven four wide
into the stretch, remained on his inside lead until outside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and safely secured the place while no match
for the winner. DOC SULLIVAN climbed greenly into the kickback near the five-eighths pole, was urged along near the rear, dropped further behind late on
the backstretch, angled from the four path to the rail on the turn and improved for the show. SOLO EMPIRE was last to commence then ridden along on the
outside, went five wide on the turn, dropped inward in upper stretch and was no factor. UPTOMYKNEESINIT chased the pace while just behind the leader,
checked sharply while lugging out into the turn, went around that bend in the two path under a right-handed crop, angled out into upper stretch, remained on
his inside lead in the drive and came up empty. PERNO was hustled from the gate, raced just off the pace, tossed his head and was taken back while keen
under tight restraint at the nine-sixteenths, dropped further back leaving the backstretch, was roused three wide on the turn, floated six wide into upper
stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and had nothing left. FRANKIE R. bumped with a rival at the start, dropped back under some urging, went
two to three wide on the turn and failed to respond. HAIR ON FIRE broke in at the start, climbed into kickback while urged at the rear, moved from the rail to
the three path on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and showed little.

Footnotes
EL CAPI established the front shortly after the start and spurted away along the inside while in hand, tipped to the two path through the turn and continued
to widen away, swung three then two wide straightened away into upper stretch placed to urging, went clear under a light drive and was geared down inside
the final seventy yards to prevail impressively at the end. HOP SING got away to an awkward beginning getting away near the rear of the field, chased six
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the inside steadily into the turn forcing VINO BARBARINO to alter out seven-sixteenths from home
when not entirely clear of that rival, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while
dueling to the finish keeping on to secure the place honors. CONQUEST WARRIOR broke a half a beat slow, chased five to six paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for
the top one while knocking heads to the finish with the aforementioned foe and was ultimately bested by that rival while well clear of the rest. IGNITE THE
LIGHT chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. SPEED
CONTROL chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
five wide into upper stretch and tired. KING MENDELSSOHN chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. COOL OPERATOR chased three to four wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from
home when in the two path, swung three wide into upper stretch, tired. VINO BARBARINO chased just off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside
into the turn, had HOP SING tucked directly in front with seven-sixteenths to go and altered off the rail two then three wide while under coaxing, angled six
wide into upper stretch, faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
WINIT went to the front, showed the way on the inside of a rival, saved ground while guided around the turn with extra left-rein pressure, responded well
when asked in the two path at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, fought with BOURBON CALLING into the final sixteenth and proved best under
strong urging. GUNTOWN broke out at the start, settled between horses, was urged three wide on the turn then driven four wide into the stretch and
finished willingly for the place. BOURBON CALLING was hustled from the gate then settled off the pace, went two then three wide while between horses on
the turn, was given his cue near the five-sixteenths, gained five wide into the stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, led narrowly while well out
in track passing the eighth-pole, fought with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the show. SYNTHESIS was hustled from
the gate, prompted the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened. TRAFALGAR settled towards the rear, was urged along late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, chased the leaders in the
stretch and lacked the needed kick. GILDED AGE was urged along on the outside, went four wide for most of the turn then moved to five wide, came six
wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. NO BURN was well placed down the backstretch, saved ground while asked on the turn and came up
empty. SET SAIL tracked the leading duo on the outside, chased three then four wide on the turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
AMERICAN LAW stalked the pace on the outside, drew even with the leaders in the four path on the turn, took the advantage coming to the quarter-pole,
responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch and edged clear under strong urging. KANT BEAT THE ROCK settled just off the pace on the
outside, chased five wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and was second best. MANDATORY prompted the pace on the
outside, took a short lead before the nine-sixteenths, vied between horses in the three path on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner nearing the
quarter-pole, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but just held the show. BROOKLYN
DIAMONDS bumped with a rival at the start then dropped back, moved in while urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail
into the stretch, moved back to the inside in the final furlong and just missed the show. STJAMES was urged along near the back, traveled around the turn
in the two path, came five wide into upper stretch and improved to just miss the superfecta. CLOUD FOREST bumped with a foe at the start, was ridden
along on the far outside, moved in late on the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. AULA
chased the pace down the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn and capitulated. SCREW LOOSE went to the front, showed the way under
pressure to his outside, lost the lead outside the nine-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back near the five-sixteenths and faded.

LIFE TALK went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace near the inside, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch and drew off
while kept to the task. SHIMMERING ALLURE brushed with a foe nearing the first turn, went five wide on that bend, tracked the pace on the outside, was
asked in the four path on the final turn, gained to make a bid in the three path into upper stretch but proved no match for the winner while able to get the
place. DOLOMITE moved from the rail to the two path early on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, came under coaxing near the nine-sixteenths,
chased inside on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out nearing the furlong marker and weakened but was well clear for the show.
MOST OF ALL raced in the three path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was given her cue near the seven-sixteenths, chased in the three
path on the far turn, spun four wide into upper stretch and came up empty. CALDWELL LUVS GOLD brushed with a rival nearing the first turn, was caught
in the seven path for most of that bend then dropped to the five path, settled on the outside near the back, was urged three wide on the far turn, came eight
wide into upper stretch and failed to respond. VINO ROUGE traveled around the first turn in the four path, stalked the pace, was asked while three wide on
the far turn, dropped back while seven wide into upper stretch and had nothing left. RINGY DINGY brushed with rivals on both sides nearing the first turn,
was caught in the six path for most of that bend then dropped to the three path, settled near the back, was urged some late on the backstretch, went around
the far turn in the two path, came six wide into upper stretch and capitulated. COZEE RAGS settled at the rear while inside to the two path, was urged along
on the far turn and also failed to respond.

inside through the turn coming under light coaxing briefly at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and was put to urging straightened
away, drifted out slightly before being corrected and edged clear to the finish. TIZZY IN THE SKY four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing half a
mile from home, angled in to spin just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. VENTI VALENTINE chased three to
four wide until tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a
mild bid. GOOD SAM chased five then four wide, got set down spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, came up empty, then was reported to have

Footnotes
HOIST THE GOLD established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from PIPELINE to the
outside while putting down swift splits, began to shake off that rival through the latter portion of the turn given a notch to work with, got set down spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole, held well and clear to the finish. SENOR BUSCADOR settled just off the
inside at the tail of the field early on through the opening half mile, began to advanced thereafter coming under coaxing three furlongs out, angled out eight
wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to be along clear of the rest for the place honors. CASTLE CHAOS five then four wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages while just holding on for the show
honors. THREE TECHNIQUE chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch, improved position
through to the finish just missing for the show honors on the wire. COASTAL MISSION broke in at the start and came under hustling, chased along the
inside and was placed in tight by PIPELINE tucking from the outside while along the rail, balked for a stride or two along the fence five furlongs from home
forcing EVERSO MISCHIEVOUS to steady out, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued along the inside into upper stretch and weakened.
OFFALY COOL four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened. DR ARDITO
chased three then two wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled six wide at the head of the stretch, offered no response. HIGH OAK
chased four then three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, angled out nine wide into upper stretch, had no response. PIPELINE pressed the pace
of HOIST THE GOLD from the outside three wide, got placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch remaining
prominent until straightened away, then tired through to the finish. ACCRETIVE six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn
coaxed along from the three-eighths, cornered six wide into upper stretch and tired. EVERSO MISCHIEVOUS chased just off the inside among rivals, got
placed in tight when a pair of foes tucked in from the outside and was forced to steady out five furlongs from home losing about a length and a half of
ground, tucked inside and came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch in retreat and faltered. CASCAIS chased two to
three wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn pushed along from the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch and folded.
