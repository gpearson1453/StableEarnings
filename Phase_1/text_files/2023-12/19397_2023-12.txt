Footnotes
DOG TOWN ALLEN set a pressured pace and contested the edge off the rail on the turn, was met passing the eighth pole but dug in determinedly to eke
out the advantage over METALLIC CAT in later yards. The latter pressured pace inside, raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, took a
slim lead passing the eighth pole and dueled gamely, but was outfinished later yards. JUBA'S MOCHA gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the
turn in the four path, left the turn outside, dueled through the stretch and took third under the wire. LITTLE RICHIE chased through the backstretch, raced at
the rail on the turn then eased out into the lane and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. LAST PARTY pressured the pace through the backstretch
but dropped back approaching the quarter pole, raced in the three path on the turn and flattened late stretch. GETTIN SPICY gave chase inside, raced at
the rail on the turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. JUBA'S YANKEE ONE chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the
three path and flattened late yards. CHARTERED COURSE gave chase to no avail. NOVEMBER IMPERIUM raced well back. SENZA STRIKE came away
awkwardly then steadied leaving the gate and was not a factor.
