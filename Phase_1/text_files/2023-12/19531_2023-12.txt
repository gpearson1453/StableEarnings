NEEDS FULFILLED settled mid-pack in a strung out field down the back straight, started to improve on the fence at the three furlong marker and found his
best stride late closing in quickly under left handed encouragement in the final sixteenth to get up for the well timed stretch rally. TIPSY FOX tracked the
engaged duo inside down the backstretch, rallied inside, closing the gap at the quarter pole, began to reel in the frontrunner smartly with a furlong to go but
was outkicked by the winner in deep stretch. HE SHOOTS HE WINS broke in to begin, set a brisk pace while hounded inside down the backstretch, put
away the early pace foe midway through the turn, opened up at the top of the stretch, could not find more in reserve late and tired in the final sixteenth to be
a clear third in the end. NIGHT STRIKER was pinballed between foes at the start, recovered to track the contesting front pair down the backside, crept
closer to the leader with five sixteenths to go and could not pose a threat running one paced down the stretch for a minor share. TEAPARTYTODAY was off
slowly on the break to trail down the backside, could not make any headway through the turn and showed some late energy passing tired runners down the
lane. SCREEN LEGEND broke outwards on the start, was hustled inside forcing the pace down the backside, had nothing more to offer giving way pressing
up front by midturn and emptied out at the furlong marker. CHIEF LIONHART stalked outside near the rear down the back straight, made little impression
running around the bend and lacked a rally down the stretch. HURRICANE DESHAMBO had one rival beaten down the backside, could not gain on
challengers throughout the turn and never was a factor in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
LENNY K tracked the leaders in behind and inside, waited for room turning for home, came out and split foes in upper stretch taking a narrow lead, held well
while being kept to the task. KID FORESTER stalked from outside, advanced five wide past the five-sixteenths, fought for the place while not able to reach
the winner. MR NARCISSISTIC pressed from outside three wide, kept on in the stretch but needed more. RACE FOR PINKS stalked from between foes in
the second flight, moved out four wide near the five-sixteenths and encouraged along, could not match strides with the top ones but kept on after altering out
a bit near the sixteenth pole. DRAGON'S BREW stumbled badly at the start, settled at the rear, swung seven deep turning for home, ran on. BLUE MAX
moved to the lead, set a pressured pace inside, came up empty. BET N WIN was prominent between runners early, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
ECHO WITH LAUGHTER brushed the gate on the break, was tucked in on the rail watching the front trio at the half, waited behind the leaders trying to get
out some around the turn, straightened out for home posing the main threat and wore down the leader by the sixteenth pole to edge away for the measured
victory. MR. MARSHALL assumed command at the start, dictated the pace unchallenged around the bend, opened up mildly at the top of the stretch but
was no match for the winner late but comfortably bested the rest at the wire. SPANISH SERENADE stalked near the back two wide between horses, was
nudged starting a run at the three furlong pole, crept closer inside saving ground on the turn and rallied smartly on the fence to the wire to be a clear third at
the finish line. CONFUSING trailed the field inside down the backstretch, angled out off tiring foes at the quarter pole, swung out to the six path for the drive
and finished up with good intent for a minor role in the end. RELOAD BULLET travelled in mid-pack on the outside down the back straight, was asked at the
three furlong pole, offered little run and finished up willingly while on the wrong lead throughout the stretch. VERY DEBONAIRE stalked three deep near the
back in the early going, made some progress three wide outside of horses through the turn, swung out widest in the seven path at the top of the lane but
could not offer a finish to the wire. JMR SPEEDY ESCAPE hesitated on the break, was then hustled to prompt the pace outside by the half, was urged left
handed trying to keep pace with the leader midway on the turn, could not rally with others on either side in upper stretch and faltered in the final furlong.
HARDWARE GAP brushed the gate on the start, tracked three deep outside at the half, chased the frontrunner around the turn, was in the hunt four wide at
the top of the lane, could not go on and retreated by mid-stretch.

Footnotes
JUNIPERO SERRA settled off the pace inside near the rail, shifted out on the far turn coming to the quarter pole five wide, struck the lead by the eighth pole
and won going away. LEGAL CATCH was forwardly-positioned stalking from outside, raced mostly three to four wide, made a brief bid nearing mid-stretch,
was no match for the winner but second best. STORMS OF LIFE settled toward the back racing near but off the fence, moved out five to six wide in the
stretch, gained late to get up for show honors. SASSINESS switched outside the leader stalking that one early, continued in close range two to three deep,
made a mild bid between foes in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. POLITICAL WARFARE sped clear, set the pace in the two path, weakened.
MARDENE settled at the rear off the inside, moved out seven wide in the stretch, failed to menace. PAINTED GLORY was outside mid-pack going mostly
four to five wide, failed to rally. MRS. C tracked from inside, came up empty.

Footnotes
FAIRWAY TO HEAVEN tracked the threesome outside down the backstretch, edged closer three wide outside rivals on the turn, pounced five wide turning
for home, seized control at the eighth pole and held on while drifting out under left handed urging near the wire. LAKEFIELD stalked near the back on the
inside, rallied while in hand on the fence midway around the bend, shifted outside in the four path gaining momentum at the top of the lane, had clear run
outside at the furlong pole and was pushed out driving to the finish line to best the rest. INDY ONE pressed the pace four wide deepest outside down the
backstretch, bid three wide outside horses at the quarter pole, battled determinedly three wide in upper stretch and finished up well to be a clear third at the
wire. HANLAN had a slow start on the break, settled in mid-pack on the rail along the backstretch, was coaxed at the three furlong pole closing the gap on
the fence through the turn and willingly ran down the lane to settle on the fringes in the end. PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE was hustled down the back straight
chasing the pacesetter, continued to keep in close range on the leader into the turn, bid two wide between runners in upper stretch, could not go on with
others closing in by mid-stretch and faded in the final furlong. FAST AND READY prompted three deep between horses down the backside, was throttled
back being shuffled at the seven sixteenth marker, kept up to the frontrunners through the turn, angled outside six wide for the drive and finished up evenly
down the stretch. MONDAY MORNING travelled in midfield outside of runners in the early going, kept pace the leaders around the oval, shifted inwards in
mid-stretch but could not get involved driving to the finish line. ROAR OF THE CROWD was slow to begin, had one rival beaten down the backstretch,
made no progress through the turn and showed some energy to pass weary runners in the stretch. FOREST FLASH stalked near the back outside of horses
down the backside, came under a ride midway on the turn, could not quicken with others and did not make a presence in the stretch running. FRAC RIGHT
took command from the start, set the fractions through the turn inside, was collared outside at the quarter pole, offered little resistance and wilted on the
fence by the furlong marker. BLUE MONTJEU broke with the field but was void of early speed and trailed down the backstretch, could not catch up with the
pack around the turn and was not a factor in the drive to the wire. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN OF #9 FAIRWAY TO
HEAVEN AND #7 LAKEFIELD RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
JOKESTAR settled outside four deep mid-pack, was under urging past the three-eighths commencing a move four to five wide, struck the lead in upper
stretch, kicked clear, just lasted. BEYOND ADVERSITY settled in behind runners inside on or just off the rail mid-pack, saved some ground through the far
turn before swinging out six wide into upper stretch, rallied strongly to be gaining late but just missed. AMERICAN DECISION settled in behind tracking
inside, was up close into the far turn, moved out three wide coming to the quarter pole, kept on in the stretch but needed more. CATCH THE DRIFT broke a
bit outwardly, was forwardly-placed between runners four wide into the first turn, continued to stalk three deep into the far turn, ran on in the stretch to gain a
position late. ECSTASY was forced out a bit at the start, caught five wide into the first turn with forward stalking position, moved in a bid and advanced four
then three wide to the lead by the five-sixteenths, faltered and faded in the lane. DUBAWI BULL was in just a bit tight at the start, unhurriedly brought up the
rear, came out a bit for the stretch run, finished up with mild late interest. MUCHO MAGNIFICO was between foes three deep mid-pack early, dropped back
into the far turn, swung eight wide into upper stretch, kicked on mildly. AWESOME ENTRY raced outside a foe early two to three wide, shifted seven deep
into upper stretch, failed to menace. DESTIN NIGHT set the pace inside on or just off the rail, gave way. BLONDINA'S BOY was outrun.
PROFESORRIDESAGAIN broke outwardly a bit, was up close stalking two to three wide, steadily retreated.

Footnotes
RELOAD'S RASCAL pressed the pace inside under a snug hold down the back straight, assumed the lead midpoint on the turn while still running in hand,
braced for the challenge outside at the top of the stretch and stubbornly fended off the runner up at the wire in a photo. HILARIOUS AFFAIR tracked in the
second flight three wide down the backstretch, crept closer four wide circling runners on the turn, loomed in the five path straightening out for home and
tenaciously was gaining with every stride to the wire but just missed timing the rally for the win. QUITE READY was nestled behind the leaders on the rail
down the backside, followed the winner saving ground around the turn, could not threaten the top pair who were in a match race at the top of the stretch but
finished up gamely to win the battle for show. DOWNY BOY stalked outside near the back in the early going, rallied three wide around horses at the quarter
pole, swung out to be eight wide at the top of the lane and showed good late energy to get up for a minor role in the end. GRACEFUL FIGHTER trailed the
field at the half, could still see the pack through the turn and found his best stride late passing many runners in the drive to the finish line. SALVATOR
MUNDI settled in midfield on the inside in the early stages, kept pace travelling inside around the oval but could not rally inside of rivals down the stretch.
CHAIRMAN BOB travelled in mid-pack outside foes down the backstretch, made little impact through the turn, shifted out six wide for the drive and ran on
mildly with rivals on each side down the lane. MAAKWA was in the mix three wide between rivals down the backstretch, could not maintain forward position
at the seven sixteenths marker, was in range for a share in the five path turning for home but lacked a rally in the stretch. LONG POND was unhurried
trailing in the beginning, caught up to runners by the half, improved on the fence throughout the turn, lost its path on the rail at the furlong pole and could not
recover to be involved in the end. FEELTHEBEAT prompted the pace three wide down the back straight, forced the issue three wide between horses up
front at the quarter pole, could not go on and retreated at the furlong marker. BACHELOR PAD had a slim advantage on the lead down the backside, gave
way up front with five sixteenths from home and folded between runners in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ONE BAY HEMINGWAY broke outwardly a bit and just a hair slowly, was mildly coaxed forward inside to the lead about the five-eighths, drew clear in the
stretch and held sway. HALL OF DREAMS settled off the pace, went about two to four wide through most of the turn, fanned six to seven deep into upper
stretch, rallied between runners to get the place. JAMIESTA was prominent in the very early stages, steadily dropped back up the backstretch and into the
turn, made a swift move coming to upper stretch seven to eight deep but evened out and was outfinished for second. ZAKHARI had the early lead then
attended the pace from outside two to three wide, kept on in the stretch. COHERENCE stalked from outside, went mostly five wide through the turn, evened
out in the drive. HUNGRY WOLF was ridden three furlongs out and advanced four wide but evened out. SILENT MIRACLE was never far back tracking
inside on or just off the rail, went evenly and made no bid. ONE MORE BREW settled off the pace racing near the rail, lacked room in the stretch in behind
and inside from the furlong marker till late. POSTURING fanned seven wide into the stretch, failed to menace. MOON LANDING was between runners early,
raced mostly two to three wide, was not a threat.

Footnotes
J P HELLISH was content to track the loose pacesetter down the backside, started to reel in the frontrunner by the quarter pole, loomed the only threat
outside at the top of the lane and under a vigorous ride got up in the final strides. STEAK AND CHEESE took command from the onset, set a honest pace
uncontested down the backside, battled determinedly inside through the stretch with the winner and just missed holding for the win in the last few jumps
before the wire with a solid frontrunning effort. LAC MACAZA stalked on the rail in the beginning, improved starting a run on the fence into the far turn,
chased the front pair home down the stretch and held on to be a non threaten third at the finish line. CLEAR DESTINATION trailed the field into the first turn,
continued seeing the pack down the back straight, rallied up the fence with three eighths to go, made a strong move inside at the quarter pole and finished
up with intent almost closing in for third money late. SIMCOE stalked three wide outside horses around the first turn, made no progress outside horses down
the back straight, offered a mild turn of foot four wide around rivals in the final bend and was one paced in the stretch. MIGHTY SEA stalked near the back
outside in the early stages, was asked with three furlongs to go, could not accelerate with others making a move around the far bend and was not involved
in the stretch running. RELOAD'S REBEL tracked the top pair inside on the first turn, continued to watch the front two down the back straight, was roused
midway on the far turn, offered no response and tired in upper stretch. ROSEBUD'S HOPE travelled in mid-pack down the backstretch, was hard ridden
three furlongs from the wire, offered little run and had nothing to give in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
JIMMIES BIG DAY tracked in behind the leading pair and inside a foe, found room inside at the top of the stretch, shot through and cleared. FABLED
PRINCE settled off the pace near but off the inside, moved out making a sweeping move outside foes six wide, loomed a threat but was only second best.
QUIET INTENT settled off the pace inside, shifted out past the five-sixteenths about three wide then wider still in upper stretch, kicked on to get up for show
honors late. UMNEYAAT was very lightly bumped at the start, raced about mid-division in a strung-out field, gained late inside. CLASSIC DANCER broke
sharply, ceded the early lead content to stalk from outside, went about three to four wide, evened out. ROOKIE RADAR raced off the inside, moved out
seven wide turning for home, ran on mildly. DREAM ON BABY got away slowly, was outpaced early, saved ground on the turn, improved inside. NONNO'S
LITTLE BOY broke a step slowly, swung six wide into upper stretch, needed more late. AMBER LIGHT dueled outside two to three wide, gave way.
KINETIC STONE dueled inside, drifted out a bit leaving the turn, came up empty. GUARD OF HONOUR was not a factor.
