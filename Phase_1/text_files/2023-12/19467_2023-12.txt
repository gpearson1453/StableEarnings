FOREST MAIDEN stalked the loose pacesetter, took over at the quarter pole then drew away in the stretch under moderate pressure. AUNT BERRA moved
clear early, was collared on the turn then weakened in the stretch. ONTHISHARVESTMOON settled just behind the pacesetters then flattened out in the
stretch. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS dropped back inside and gradually faltered. PARADIGM SHIFT lacked speed racing wide and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC LION settled off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied outside turning for home charged to the front nearing the eighth pole and
drew off under urging. BIG BROOK bumped at the start, stalked two wide, chased two wide on the far turn, rallied between horses entering the stretch, bid
and came up second best. ROAD CALL raced four wide early, then dropped back, moved up on the far turn, rallied mildly outside and was along for third.
GOLD BLING set the pace racing with a clear lead, dueled inside rivals entering the stetch and faded in the final furlong. LAST DREAM was bumped at the
start, raced off the pace inside, then two wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. BUBBY PAPERMAKER raced off the rail, off the pace, three wide on the far
turn and failed to threaten. KEEP IT SALTY raced off the pace, went three wide on the backside and did not factor. T'WAS THE NIGHT tracked on the
inside, chased on the far turn and gave way.

BURANO set the pace racing with a measured lead, showed the way on the far turn, responded when set down at the top of the lane, pulled away and was
kept to the task. LULI'S DANCER stalked close up outside, chased the winner on the far turn, made a mild bid past the quarter pole, dug in gamely but
second best. LUNA T bobbled at the break, raced off the pace, came three wide into the stretch and rallied mildly for third. SIRENETTA tracked on the
inside, then chased and tired. CATALENA raced off the pace, two wide on the backside and failed to threaten.

AZTEC BAY sprinted clear early inside, resisted when challenged, vied to midstretch and edged away driving. VALIANT MAJESTY bid to contention
outside, led narrowly but was outfinished. EIGHTY EIGHT KEYS broke slowest and raced far behind, saved ground and closed well. BRUNO BARBER
GIRL lacked speed, advanced in the two path with late energy. BLACK DIAMOND RAIN made a menacing outside bid at the quarter pole then flattened out.
WICKED LADY was urged close up in the opening quarter between rivals then faded. BABY SOX chased very wide down the backstretch and weakened.
MENDELIAN raced four wide early and began fading on the turn. LUCKY FLUSH trailed early racing wide and was never in contention. DIVINE TWIST
prompted the pace briefly then stopped abruptly. PER RULING FROM HIWU, LUCKY FLUSH WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

stretch run, exchanged light bumps at the eighth pole, then dueled to the finish and narrowly prevailed. BAD BAD MR. BROWN dueled between rivals for
the early lead, dueled inside on the turn, battled heads apart in the stretch, exchanged bumps at the furlong marker, then dueled to the wire and just missed.
LUKA D chased outside, chased three wide on the turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, then dug in late to earn the show spot. LUV YA BLUE dueled
inside in a three way early tussle, steadied and shuffled back nearing the turn, then chased and rallied mildly inside in the stretch. KUZ IT'S CHILLY raced
off the pace inside and did not factor. EDDIE W stumbled badly at the start, raced off the rail and was outrun.

NAMORA raced off the pace inside, moved up between rivals on the turn, rallied three wide at the quarter pole, took over, kicked clear and then held well
under urging. MIKEY'S SONG raced off the pace inside, moved up on the turn, steadied when lacking room nearing the quarter pole, then came three wide
into the lane and rallied inside for second. STEAL THE DEAL raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up five wide at the quarter pole and rallied mildly
outside. BREEZY DANCE stalked the dueling leaders, rallied four wide at the quarter pole, made a bid and weakened. LUCKY OPPORTUNITY dueled
inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and faded. EVERHEART dueled three wide for the early lead, then dueled two wide on the turn and faded. FAR TOO
FOXY dueled between rivals for command, dropped back on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
EMPIRE PASS engaged in race long duel inside, battled throughout and outdueled rival through the final furlong. GOLDEN TABBY earned a narrow
advantage to the eighth pole in a long duel, but was outfinished in the late stages. BUCKS SOME well placed outside the dueling leaders and raced evenly
late. R FUNNY BIZNESS saved ground off the pace, moved wide in the stretch and flattened out. BROAD JUMPER lagged far behind then caught fading
rivals late. SPANIKOPITA lacked speed along the inside and failed to respond. IRIE EMPRESS was coaxed close up between rivals in the opening quarter
and gave way.
