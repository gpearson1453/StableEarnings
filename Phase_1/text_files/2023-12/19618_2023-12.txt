Footnotes
COPPER BO TEN assumed command away from the start, was well handled through decent early fractions and showed the way into the turn while off of
the rail, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and led to the furlong marker, kept to task to the sixteenth-pole, dug in while
under pressure in deep stretch and lasted for the win at the finish. SOO BROOKLYN took back leaving the start, tracked the decent early pace while
between runners and was well placed approaching the turn, tracked between runners along the bend and gained ground nearing the quarter pole, waited for
racing room nearing the top of the stretch, found room and slipped to the rail heading to the furlong marker, loomed at mid-stretch, responded to urging into
the final sixteenth, pressured the winner in deep stretch and just missed for the win in the final strides, while besting the rest. KIKI KRAZY broke alertly, took
back off of the early pace and tracked from the outside, maintained a four wide path into the turn and gained ground nearing the quarter pole, chased four
wide into the stretch, closed in the final sixteenth but could not reel in the top pair and was clear in the end for third. GRAZED N' CONFUSED broke in at the
start and bothered a neighboring rival, was hustled to be forwardly placed in the early stages and raced close up to the decent pace, maintained a three
wide path into the turn and pressed COPPER BO TEN to the quarter pole, lost position into the stretch and chased to the furlong grounds, lacked a late
response and gave way. SMILE AND PROFILE well placed in the early stages, tracked the decent pace from the inside and saved ground into the turn,
raced within aim into the stretch, could not keep pace at the furlong marker and weakened. VALERIE chased the decent early pace, raced two then three
wide to the quarter marker and did not offer a late rally. VIOLET THUNDER bumped leaving the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed, saved ground
to the top of the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
RUNNING ON FIRE crowded a bit at the start by EN TU HONOR BRO, recovered and tracked the solid early pace from a three wide position, raced three
wide into the turn and loomed nearing the quarter marker, chased DANZING REBEL into the stretch, responded to urging and closed determinedly into the
final sixteenth, battled the game runner-up to the wire and prevailed in the final strides. DANZING REBEL sent to be forwardly placed away from the start,
engaged with UNION EXPRESS in the early stages and contested the solid pace with that runner into the turn, pressed UNION EXPRESS through quick
fractions to the quarter pole, took command into the stretch and led to the furlong marker, was confronted by RUNNING ON FIRE nearing the
sixteenth-marker, battled with the determined winner into deep stretch, was bested in the final strides and was well clear for second in a game runner-up
effort. EN TU HONOR BRO drifted in leaving the start and bothered rivals to his inside in the early stages, tracked the solid pace four wide heading into the
turn, lost position and chased two wide to the quarter pole, ran evenly to the furlong marker, was not able to impact the top two in the final sixteenth and
stayed on to secure third. THE FUSS bothered at the start and was off slowly, chased the solid early pace from the rear, was steered three wide into the
turn and gained ground nearing the quarter marker, shifted four wide for the drive and continued to gain at the furlong pole, was a bit green into the final
sixteenth, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and passed a tired rival late. UNION EXPRESS showed good early speed and assumed command
soon after the break, set a pressured pace into the turn and carved out fast fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, was overtaken into the stretch,
chased the leaders to the furlong marker and tired in the final stages. CALCULATED SPIN bothered at the start and was off slowly, chased from the back in
the early stages, lost ground along the turn and did not factor in the stretch. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE
RACE. THE STEWARDS RULED THAT EN TU HONOR BRO DRIFTED IN SOON AFTER THE START AND BOTHERED SEVERAL RUNNERS TO HIS
INSIDE, COSTING THEM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING. EN TU HONOR BRO WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED SIXTH.

Footnotes
KO SAMUI (IRE) reserved near the rear of the pack for the first half mile, began to build momentum through the far turn, found room up the rail into the
stretch raced in tight quarters to the eighth pole then quickened away once clear. STRAIT OF GEORGIA broke well and followed RESPOND to the head of
the pack without behind asked, took up a stalking position just off the flank of that foe and in the two path, was set down passing the five-sixteenths pole,
responded to strong handling, took a brief lead in the stretch then was outfinished by the winner in the final yards. YOU KIDDING ME outrun to the first turn,
tucked in to save ground through the clubhouse turn racing well behind in the early going, was prompted to pick up the pace passing the half mile pole then
found another gear near the five-sixteenths marker, swung seven wide into the stretch and made a bold rally down the middle of the track to gain third.
NUESTRO ENGREIDO was pinballed at the start, recovered quickly and was hustled away then settled just behind the pace under some restraint, bided
time through the turn while seeking running room, tried to squeeze through a narrow opening at the eighth pole but was unsuccessful and finished evenly.
RESPOND broke sharply and was first into the turn without much prompting, was allowed to set reasonable fractions with mild pressure from STRAIT OF
GEORGIA in pursuit, met the challenge posed by that rival from the five-sixteenths pole, battled gamely into the stretch then weakened passing the furlong
marker. DUPLICATION raced in mid-pack early then moved up close to the pacesetters down the backstretch, launched a bid with three furlongs to run,
loomed a threat three wide into the stretch then flattened out before mid-stretch. REGULATION DAZED was not asked for speed from the gate and was
content to settle behind the field while holding the rail, never quickened at any point and finished one-paced and well beaten. DI LAURIAN went four wide
around the first turn, raced mid-pack for a half mile, began to struggle to keep pace with three furlongs to run, dropped back and was not a factor down the
stretch.

BRAND NEW DREAM forwardly placed away from the start, saved ground while well positioned into the backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace from
the inside heading to the half-mile marker, shifted to the two path nearing the quarter pole and raced within aim approaching the top of the stretch, ran
evenly to the furlong marker, responded to urging and was full of run nearing the sixteenth-pole, mounted a strong late rally in deep stretch, overtook
ARCTIC BREEZE in the final stages and edged clear to prevail. ARCTIC BREEZE showed good early speed and was prominent leaving the break,
engaged with YO BABY along the first turn and contested the moderate pace with that rival into the backstretch, disputed the pace to the half-mile marker
and dueled with YO BABY into the far turn, took command into upper stretch and drifted in a bit nearing the furlong pole, was kept to task while leading into
the final sixteenth, was overtaken by the quickly oncoming winner in deep stretch and was outfinished, while well clear of the rest for second. UNION
HEIRESS allowed to settle, was steered two then three wide along the first turn while unhurried, gained a bit of ground heading to the half-mile marker, split
runners along the far turn and raced two wide to the quarter pole, swung three wide for the drive and ran evenly to the furlong marker, angled four wide into
the final sixteenth, was not able to impact the top pair in deep stretch but was gaining in the final strides and outfinished YO BABY to secure third. YO BABY
broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, engaged with ARCTIC BREEZE in the early going and set contested fractions through the
backstretch run, contested the pace into the far turn, lost the lead to ARCTIC BREEZE in upper stretch and came in a bit tight at the furlong marker while
battling against that rival, shifted out and chased into the final sixteenth, tired in deep stretch and was outfinished for third in the final strides. LADY GOOD
TROUBLE raced a bit in tight away from the start, recovered to track the early pace between runners, was well positioned heading to the half-mile marker,
steered to the outside and chased three then four wide at the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the stretch and gave way. SUSIE CRU forwardly
placed in the early running, tracked four wide along the first turn, tracked the moderate pace outside of runners through the backstretch run, slipped to the
inside nearing the second turn, lost ground at the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. REAL QUEEN allowed to settle in the early stages, saved
ground into the backstretch run, lost contact along the second turn and came up empty in the stretch. THE RIDER OF YO BABY LODGED AN OBJECTION
AGAINST THE RIDER OF ARCTIC BREEZE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO
THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL HORNET broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set quick fractions while dictating terms into the turn, drew to a clear lead at the quarter
marker while off of the rail, extended the lead into the stretch, drew away into the final sixteenth and was hand ridden to the finish as much the best.
WORTH LOOKING squeezed at the start, took up and was off slowly, trailed in the early running and saved ground into the turn, gained ground nearing the
quarter marker then was blocked nearing the top of the stretch, angled three wide for the drive and looked for racing room nearing the furlong pole, found a
seam approaching the final sixteenth, closed willingly and was up in the final strides to secure second. WILD BILLY D chased the solid early pace three
wide, raced between runners into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, ran in pursuit three wide into the stretch, could not keep pace with the winner in
the late stages, was just edged for second in the final strides and held clearly for third. EDDIE CROSSWIRE close up to the solid early pace, came in tight
and raced on a hold while between runners heading into the turn, chased between and two wide approaching the quarter pole, gave chase into the stretch
and weakened in the final stages. MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE broke out at the start, tracked the solid early pace from the inside, was blocked nearing the
quarter marker and shifted to the outside nearing the top of the stretch, was asked for run five wide into the lane, lost ground at the furlong pole and could
not muster a late response. MADE THE TEAM chased the solid pace from the outside, gave chase four wide along the turn, could not keep pace into the
stretch and tired in the final furlong. SUMMANUS broke in at the start but was away in good order, chased the solid early pace from the inside, lost position
along the turn, ran in pursuit into the stretch, lacked a response in the final stages and gave way.

Footnotes
LAW ABIDING was hustled to the front, set reasonable fractions with only light pressure from VANTAGE POINT, set down at the head of the stretch,
opened up on the field at the furlong marker, felt late pressure from the runner-up and kept to task in deep stretch to prevail. FALSELY ACCUSED always
forwardly placed, tracked three wide through the early stages, angled over to the inside before the turn, got clear run into the stretch, tipped out to the two
path and was slowly gaining on the winner. ONE FAST BRO had no speed from the break, dropped far behind early, started to rally from the
seven-sixteenths marker, found clear running between horses at the three-sixteenths pole, continued to run on through the stretch and gained third.
AMERICA GREAT raced five wide into the clubhouse turn, launched a three-wide bid from the seven-sixteenths pole, came into the stretch with every
chance but flattened out and finished even-paced to the wire. SUPERMAZEL got caught four wide through the first turn, settled in mid-pack down the
backstretch on the rail, moved into contention through the far turn but lacked any room to make a move approaching the five-sixteenths pole, could not find
another gear when needed and finished evenly under pressure. A MAN'S MAN was off a step slow then allowed to settle into stride near the rear of the field
through the first turn, made steady forward progress down the backstretch, loomed a big threat passing the three furlong pole, swung five wide into the
stretch then flattened out and was unable to improve. ROCKTILLYOUDROP raced wide throughout, made a mild move through the far turn but was never a
threat. VANTAGE POINT was hustled away from the gate then moved out to the two path to put some early pressure on LAW ABIDING, settled into a
stalking trip just to the outside and off the flank of that rival, allowed that rival to dictate the pace then was asked to challenge passing the three furlong pole,
did not respond, dropped off the pace when surrounded near the quarter pole and had nothing to offer for the stretch run.

Footnotes
COME OUT FIGHTING prominent leaving the start, contested the early pace along the first turn and pressed TAMARANDO STAR into the backstretch run,
kept pressure on the pacesetter to the half-mile marker then dueled with TAMARANDO STAR into the second turn, took command into the stretch and
kicked clear at the furlong marker, was given a pair of reminder taps of the crop into the final sixteenth, pulled away in deep stretch and was much the best.
GROGU unhurried leaving the start, trailed into the backstretch run then improved position while outside of runners at the half-mile pole, continued his
advance three then four wide at the quarter marker, maintained a four wide path into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong pole, was no match for the
winner in the final sixteenth but ran on well in deep stretch to be second best. FREE AGAIN off a step slowly leaving the break, recovered and tracked the
early pace three wide into the first turn, gained ground along the backstretch run and chased two wide into the second turn, saved ground into the stretch
and ran evenly to the furlong marker, was not able to impact the top two in deep stretch but stayed on in the end to secure third. TAMARANDO STAR away
in good order, established the early lead and showed the way into the first turn, set a contested pace to the half-mile marker and dueled with COME OUT
FIGHTING into the far turn, lost the lead to that rival into upper stretch and chased to the furlong grounds, could not match strides into the final sixteenth,
faded and was just edged for third in the final strides. THIRSTY BABY settled in the second flight leaving the start, was unhurried through the backstretch
run and lost position at the half-mile marker, raced two then three wide along the far turn, gained ground into the stretch, could not muster a final response
and finished evenly. VERITAS AEQUITAS forwardly placed early on and stalked the pace three wide into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace from the
outside heading to the half-mile marker, gained ground three wide approaching the quarter pole, was outrun into the stretch and gave way in the final
stages. ELEGANT BOY settled off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, was well placed through the backstretch run and saved ground
heading to the far turn, could not keep pace along the second turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
DADDYS NINA tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, was well positioned heading into the turn and gained ground three then four wide nearing
the quarter pole, improved position into the stretch then Monroy lost his crop at the furlong marker, made a sustained rally into the final sixteenth, wore down
the game runner-up in deep stretch and was up in time to determinedly prevail. HARBOR'S ROSE crowded at the start and was a step slow to begin,
showed good early speed and rushed up to dispute the solid early pace, pressed three wide into the turn and loomed nearing the top of the lane, took
command approaching mid-stretch and led into the final sixteenth, was all out in deep stretch and was tagged for the win in the final strides, while clear of
the rest for second in a game runner-up effort. FEISTY ELLA bobbled at the break, was slow into stride and spotted the field several lengths to begin,
tracked the solid early pace from the rear, improved position four then five wide approaching the quarter marker, swung widest for the drive and ran evenly
to mid-stretch, closed willingly in the late stages, could not impact the top pair in deep stretch and held safely at the finish for third. SHEZA QUEEN BEE
rated off of the solid early pace, was steered outside of runners into the turn and raced four wide to the quarter marker, ran in pursuit to mid-stretch, could
not catch the leaders in the final sixteenth but showed good late interest in deep stretch. CAT BANDIT veered in towards the gap after the start, recovered
and rushed up to join STANDFORGRIT to contest the early pace, dueled inside of that foe to the stretch, battled for the lead to the furlong marker, could not
keep pace into deep stretch and gave way late. STANDFORGRIT broke sharply but veered out and bothered HARBOR'S ROSE, still made it to the lead
before the five furlong pole, was pressed on the inside by CAT BANDIT, dueled to the stretch then weakened once past the three-sixteenths pole and had
nothing left for the final furlong. CALIGRAPHY chased the solid pace while between runners, gained ground two wide and between runners at the quarter
marker, maintained a two wide path into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong pole, could not muster a late response and weakened. RHONDA'S
COOKIN chased the solid pace from the inside, maintained an inside path into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, was outkicked into the final
sixteenth and ran in to traffic in deep stretch. WEGOTTODRINKING hustled from the gate, tracked close to the early pace while racing four wide down the
backstretch, was bumped and forced out wider near the five sixteenths pole, lost momentum and was not persevered with from there.
