Footnotes
I'M A RISQUE GIRL close up to the early pace, took back and tracked the moderate pace into the turn, ran in pursuit of CRY ME A RUNNER while two wide
approaching the quarter marker, confronted CRY ME A RUNNER and battled with that rival into the stretch, took command inside of the furlong pole, dug in
while kept to task into the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from the runner-up and determinedly lasted for the win at the finish. FIVE O COCKTAIL allowed
to settle, got caught in a bit of traffic into the turn and waited approaching the quarter marker, angled four wide into the stretch, finished well in the late
stages, pressured the winner in the final strides but could not get by the determined winner and was second best. SWEET LAYLA RAE chased the
moderate pace four wide, tipped to the five path into upper stretch, offered a mild late rally and just held for third at the wire. GRAZEN IN THE SUN off a
step slowly, chased the moderate pace outside of runners, swung six wide for the drive, improved position in the final sixteenth and just missed for third.
CRY ME A RUNNER assumed command away from the start, set moderate fractions into the turn and drew to a clear lead heading to the quarter marker,
met the bid of I'M A RISQUE GIRL into the stretch, could not keep pace in the final stages and weakened late. GETAWAY CHARM chased three deep into
the turn and gave way. GENTLE JULIA chased from the inside and tired.

Footnotes
SIR GREYSON assumed command away from the start, set modest fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, shook free at mid-stretch, was kept to
task into the final sixteenth and drew to a clear lead in deep stretch to hold sway. RAGER tracked the modest pace from the outside, was roused three wide
for the stretch drive, could not impact the winner in the final stages and rallied for second at the finish. UNRAPTURED asked for speed away from the start,
confronted SIR GREYSON and pressed that rival through modest early fractions, pressured the pace to the quarter marker, lost ground to SIR GREYSON
into upper stretch and chased to mid-stretch, gave way inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished for second, while holding clearly for third.
LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF a bit keen in the early stages, tracked the modest pace from the inside, Orozco lost his crop into upper stretch, and did not offer
a late rally.

Footnotes
ROSES R BLUE allowed to settle, improved position two wide along the turn, was roused at the quarter marker and circled five wide into the lane, loomed at
mid-stretch and took command at the furlong pole, kicked to a clear lead into the final sixteenth and drew away to prevail as much the best. DRAW NEAR
rated nicely off of the contentious early pace and tracked from the inside, gained ground into the turn and waited for racing room approaching the quarter
marker, swung four wide into the stretch and raced within aim to the furlong grounds, was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth and stayed on to
best the rest. BACALAR asked for speed leaving the break, pressed the decent early pace three wide while on a hold, maintained that three wide path into
the turn and contested the pace to the quarter marker, gained command into upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the
winner into the final sixteenth, weakened in deep stretch and saved third at the finish. DAWN AT LAST away in good order, raced close up to the decent
early pace, was well positioned while saving ground into the turn and stalked the modest pace heading to the quarter marker, battled for the lead into upper
stretch, lacked a response inside of the furlong marker, gave way in the final stages and was nailed on the line for third. RIVIERA SUNRISE chased the
early pace, lost ground into the turn and was coaxed along two wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to the furlong pole, made up ground in deep stretch
but was unable to threaten. WEGOTTODRINKING chased the moderate pace, came three wide to the quarter marker and did not offer a late rally.
AMANDA ROSE hustled in the early stages, assumed command and set a pressured pace into the turn, held a narrow lead along the bend while between
runners and showed the way to the quarter marker, battled against oncoming rivals into the stretch, lost position at the furlong marker and faded in the final
stages.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC GIG hustled leaving the break, assumed command in the early going and dictated terms into the turn, set a pressured pace while well handled to
the quarter marker, shook free from HEAVENLY VIOLET into upper stretch and was set down at the furlong marker, drew to a clear lead into the final
sixteenth, kept to task in deep stretch and held safely in the end to prevail. WIRLY GIRLY not far back early and tracked the pace from the second flight,
was coaxed along four wide to the quarter marker and maintained that four wide path into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong pole, rallied into the final
sixteenth, could not impact the winner in deep stretch and outfinished HEAVENLY VIOLET to secure second. HEAVENLY VIOLET prominent away from the
start, stalked the early pace then advanced into the turn and pressed MAJESTIC GIG to the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and chased
MAJESTIC GIG to the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth, was outkicked by the top pair in deep stretch and held clearly in the end for
third. RIVER AVENUE chased the early pace, ran in pursuit two wide to the quarter marker, swung to the six path into upper stretch and lost ground heading
to mid-stretch, needed more in the final furlong and offered a mild late bid. APRICOT BRANDY lacked early speed, chased three wide along the turn, swung
widest into the stretch and came seven wide to the furlong marker, could not impact the leaders in deep stretch but showed good late interest. REALLY
SATISFYING chased the early pace, maintained a two wide path into the turn and gave chase to the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. VALERIE broke in at the start and was off awkwardly, chased from the rear and saved ground into the turn, mounted a rail bid
at the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, needed more in the final furlong and finished evenly. FOREVER LOVELY forwardly placed in the early
stages, chased the modest pace three wide on the turn, lost position into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CHIEF WILD EAGLE broke well but backed off the pace and opted to save ground through the first bend, then moved to the extreme outside of the pack six
wide for the run down the backstretch, circled the field through the far turn, battled with LYING GHOST and RICH GOLD down the stretch, kept to task and
wore down the latter foe near the wire. RICH GOLD broke well then was held up and angled to the inside to avoid going five wide into the first turn, tipped
out on the backstretch and was content to race in the clear about five wide, launched a bid from the seven-sixteenths marker three to four wide, came into
the stretch in a three way duel for the lead, gained a brief advantage in mid-stretch but could not match the winner in the late stages. LYING GHOST
tracked the dueling leaders from several lengths behind, launched a bid after passing the half-mile pole, took a short lead at the quarter pole, held on to
mid-stretch but was unable to hold off the top pair late. TAM'S TIME was hustled out of the gate to no avail, getting outrun to the first turn but saved ground
through the early stages while racing well behind the pace, moved up a bit on the far turn then waited behind horses, tipped out to the five path at the
three-sixteenths pole and produced a mild rally into better position. KO SAMUI (IRE) was between horses in the group at the rear, loomed a threat near the
five-sixteenths marker responded to steady handling and ran on a bit but was not good enough in the end. GORDY'S BOY raced inside with the trailing
group through the early stages, moved up into contention on the far turn but was stuck behind horses, angle out to the three path but was unable summon a
bid. WARRENS CANDY MAN broke a step slow but was hustled to contest the early lead going into the first turn, pulled ahead but was soon joined by
RACKATAPTAP and those two pulled well ahead of the rest down the backstretch, gave way passing the three furlong marker and weakened.
RACKATAPTAP broke sharply and went forward with intent, joined up with WARRENS CANDY MAN passing the thirteen-sixteenths pole, dueled with that
rival to the far turn, gained a slight advantage at the three furlong pole but was taken on a trio to the outside, was overtaken at the quarter pole and hand
nothing to offer down the stretch. LOOKOUT POINT was allowed to settle into stride the raced near the front of the group trailing well behind the speed duel,
became boxed in through the far turn, swung out to the five path for the stretch run but could do no better than chase the field home.

the stretch and was full of run approaching the furlong grounds, loomed at mid-stretch and battled for the lead nearing the sixteenth-pole, gained command
into deep stretch and drew away to prevail. AMANOFMYSTATURE close up to the decent early pace, gained ground three wide approaching the quarter
marker then tipped four wide for the drive, was outkicked at mid-stretch and chased BLAZE OF DREAMS into the final sixteenth, was not able to impact the
winner in deep stretch but stayed on to get up for second in the final strides. AYRTON SENNA asked for speed leaving the break and assumed command of
the early going, set a pressured pace into the turn and dueled with DAD BOD approaching the quarter marker, shook free of the pressing rival into upper
stretch and was set down heading to the furlong pole, met the bid of BLAZE OF DREAMS nearing the sixteenth-marker, could not keep pace with the
winner into deep stretch and weakened in the final stages, was nailed on the wire for second and held for third. DR PESCADO chased the early pace from
the inside, gained ground at the quarter pole and tipped two wide into upper stretch, came in tight and steadied inside of the furlong marker, lost ground into
the final sixteenth, did not offer a late response and was outfinished for third. RESPOND chased the decent early pace between runners and gained ground
two wide at the quarter marker, came in a bit tight in upper stretch and altered course heading to the furlong pole, chased into the final sixteenth and did not
offer a late rally. WRONG SPOT broke a step slowly and chased from the rear in the early stages, improved position heading to the turn and gained ground
three then four wide approaching the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch, finished evenly and was unable to make a late impact.

lost ground while four then five wide approaching mid-stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS stumbled then took up at the
start and was off slowly, chased from the inside along the turn and did not threaten in the drive. REGULATION DAZED chased the decent pace from the
outside, gave chase four then five wide and between runners along the turn, was asked for run four wide into the stretch and did not factor. DAD BOD
showed good early speed and was prominent leaving the break, pressed the decent pace outside of AYRTON SENNA then dueled for command into the
turn, lost position into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MOB BOSS sent leaving the break and assumed command in the early stages, set a fast pace while pressured into the turn, lost the lead at the quarter
marker and came again to take command into upper stretch, held foes at bay to the furlong marker, dug in under firm urging heading to the sixteenth-pole,
was all out to hold off GRIT AND CURIOSITY in deep stretch and determinedly lasted in the final strides to prevail. GRIT AND CURIOSITY allowed to settle
while never far back, gained ground three wide and between runners along the turn, came in a bit tight into upper stretch and found room approaching the
furlong pole, responded to urging and rallied into the final sixteenth, pressured MOB BOSS in deep stretch but could not get by the determined winner in the
final strides and was gamely bested. DICK BEST broke alertly, conceded the early lead and raced close up to the fast pace while outside of rivals, pressed
three wide along the turn, lost ground into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker, lacked a response in the final sixteenth and was outkicked, while
just holding for third. REFI NOW tracked the fast pace two wide and between runners, came in tight entering the turn and was shuffled back leaving the
three-furlong pole, was coaxed along two wide into the stretch, re-bid in the final furlong and just missed for third. IMPLICITLY chased the solid early pace
from the outside, raced four wide to the quarter marker, maintained that four wide path into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, offered a mild late
bid but needed more in deep stretch. BOSS OF THEMOSS pressed the fast early pace, vied between runners into the turn and took a narrow lead at the
quarter marker, battled into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and gave way. COWBOY CHARLIE chased the fast pace from the
inside, lost position into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. EDDIE CROSSWIRE chased the solid early pace from the outside, raced five wide to
the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch and did not threaten. POLACCO forwardly placed in the early stages, raced close to the solid pace
between runners heading to the turn, lost position along the turn and chased two wide to the quarter marker, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through
the final furlong and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
BEAUDACIOUS was outrun from the break but allowed to settle into stride near the back of the field, saved ground through the turn, had to idle a bit
searching for some racing room, seized the opportunity when an opening appeared in the four path at the three-sixteenths pole, pulled ahead under steady
handling and prevailed. THE LITTLE H MAN was last away and lagged at the rear of the field to the stretch, swung seven wide into the lane, drifted in in
deep stretch and was outfinished by the winner, while holding safely in the end for second. TALBOT BAY settled mid-pack early, was full of run through the
turn but became boxed in, got in tight quarters in mid-stretch trying to slip through a narrow opening, finished with good energy and gained third. TO
SPEIGHT HER broke best and took the lead from the gate but was quickly overtaken by COLLECT DIS MONEY, stayed to the inside, waited for room on
the turn, split horses at the top of the stretch, finished up well but came up short of third. SHARONA'S WILD BOY raced mid-pack down the backstretch
staying out in the clear in the four path, rallied into contention through the turn, came six wide into the stretch, raced in tight then had to steady at the
sixteenth marker when THE LITTLE H MAN drifted in deep stretch and was unable to recover. OUR BOLD PRINCE pressed three wide through the early
going, moved up to challenge for the lead near the quarter pole, remained prominent to the furlong grounds then was outrun late. JACK SIXPACK pressed
the pace just off the flank of COLLECT DIS MONEY, took command passing the quarter pole, but could not sustain the bid and weakened in the stretch.
COLLECT DIS MONEY broke alertly then sped to the early lead followed in close pursuit by JACK SIXPACK and OUR BOLD PRINCE to the outside, held
sway to the top of the stretch, came under pressure and gave way. THE RIDER OF SHARONA'S WILD BOY LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE
RIDER OF THE LITTLE H MAN FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. IN A MAJORITY DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT WHILE THE
LITTLE H MAN CAME IN SLIGHTLY IN THE STRETCH, THE ACTION WAS NOT ENOUGH TO COST SHARONA'S WILD BOY THE OPPORTUNITY OF
A BETTER PLACING AND NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

DESERT RUMBLE was outrun from the start then allowed to settle into stride near the rear of the compact field, saved ground through the turn, ran into
some traffic while full of run, got a fortunate hole to run through when SYGRAYEM drifted out just past the furlong marker, opened up and won clear. OOPS
AND DOWNS broke a bit slow and was last early though not far back, steadied near the seven-sixteenths marker, was blocked while full of run through the
turn, steadied again in mid-stretch when trying to get clear to the outside, dove to the inside found some room and put in a big late surge but was too late.
AUTISM COUNTS got away awkwardly then was bothered some by ADDY PEARL and was last into stride, stayed four to five wide through the turn while
making slow but steady forward progress, continued the run into the stretch and finished well under intermittent urging to gain the third placing. SYGRAYEM
broke out and made light contact with MISS PERU then was hustled away, racing four wide as part of the group contesting the early lead, remained
prominent through the turn, made a bid for the lead from the five-sixteenths pole, tried to run on under steady handling but was outfinished in the late
stages. SILVER MATY broke well and dueled for the early lead from the inside, ceded the lead passing the half mile pole, then re-engaged and waited for
an opening along the rail that never materialized, squeezed through a narrow opening between horses just past the furlong marker, ran on but came up
short. AGUILA DEL RIO broke best but was not part of the early duel, started to lose a little ground going into the turn but re-rallied under strong handling,
swung out to the six path for the stretch run on the wrong lead, made some light mutual contact with AUTISM COUNTS then had a close encounter with
OOPS AND DOWNS, then finished one-paced to the wire. ADDY PEARL came away well and was between horses with the early leaders to the turn,
continued to battle on through the turn, came into the stretch with every chance then gave way passing the furlong pole. FAR FAR AWAY got away in good
order and was content to sit behind the pace duel, made a forward move through the turn to get into contention, waited behind a wall of horses near the
five-sixteenths pole then swung out to the five path entering the stretch, ducked in just past the three-sixteenths marker, lost momentum and was unable to
recover. STEPHANIE'S CANDY broke sharply and raced between horses as part of the early speed duel, took a short lead at the half-mile pole, held to the
top of the stretch then tired before mid-stretch. MISS PERU broke well, showed brief speed early, came under pressure before the half, struggled to keep up
through the turn then had nothing to offer late.
