EXPECTING A WINNER was bumped by a horse to his inside and veered in as a result at the start, recovered to duel between horses up the backstretch,
continued to battle from the two path around the turn and edged clear in the stretch. OBSTREPEROUS was blocked and forced to check leaving the gate,
moved up to duel on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and couldn't go with the winner in the final furlong but chased that rival
home. PANOLA dueled on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, gave way in the lane
and kept on from there. BINGO'S DREAM bobbled leaving the gate, tracked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around
the far turn and finished evenly. PAMZ PALACE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly.
LITERATI veered out and bumped with several horses to his outside at the break, raced at the back of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, saved
ground around the turn and improved position mildly in the lane. RITZ ON BROADWAY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch,
continued around the turn in the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. TOUCHED BY QUALITY raced off the pace up the backstretch, navigated the
bend from the three path and showed no kick. DIAMOND ROMANCE raced at the back of the pack on the outside early, came around the turn in the three
path and made no bid. MISS IMELDA bumped with the horses to both sides at the start, raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch,
continued around the turn in the two path and faded in the stretch.

PATRIOT SPIRIT stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole
and kicked clear. CRAZY MASON raced off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, swung out to the four path coming around the bend, began a bid
in upper stretch and gained ground late. RATHMORE bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, recovered to lead the way on the inside up the
backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and gave way in the stretch. SIR FLASH hopped up leaving the gate, bumping with the horse to his
inside at the break, recovered to track the leader from the rail up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and weakened in the lane. GOTTS GOT IT
bumped with the horses to both sides at the break, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and
finished evenly. SOUND OF THE BEAST raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path and
showed no kick. EL PRINCIPITO chased the leader between horses through the early going, navigated the turn from the three path and faded from there.
SIR MI TOLEE trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.

around the far bend and dug in gamely in the lane but narrowly missed. ROMANTIC STORY bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, raced in the
two path around the first turn, stalked the leader between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the far bend and gained ground late. QUEENS
