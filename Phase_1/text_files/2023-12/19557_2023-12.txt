Footnotes
PIRATE RADIO stalked in the three path, was driven in the four path around the far turn, ran on while tipping in to bid in the three path passing the eighth
pole, dueled with an inner foe to the wire, and prevailed. BATTLE OF DOVER tracked inside, got stymied in the two path early around the far turn, was
roused to split foes in the three path turning into the stretch, led passing the eighth pole, dug in to try to fight off an outer foe in the final furlong, but lost the
bob to place. T B TWELVE ALWAYS chased in the three path, was ridden into the far turn, lost ground rounding the far turn, swung out to the six path at the
top of the stretch, and finished evenly for show. STABLE STORM broke in a tangle and was out in the five path around the first turn, prompted the pace in
the four path down the backside, bid in the three path around the far turn, had to steady in upper stretch, but was already beginning to fade. CRYPTONYM
broke slowly, was held up off the pace in the five path down the backside, ranged up under coaxing approaching the quarter, but drifted out to the seven
path while turning into the stretch, and weakened. JAKE'S AFFECTION set the pace in the two path, was roused from just off the rail into the far turn, but
yielded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
DETERMINED EFFORT settled off the pace along the inside, tipped out in upper stretch, waited for room, found a seam in midstretch and surged clear
under confident handling. SECRET THREAT was pinched back a the start, trailed two wide, swung widest in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the
lane and finished strongly. CHARGE OFF tossed his head at the start, raced well back inside, angled out in upper stretch and rallied between foes to gain
the show late. EXERCISE OF POWER tracked the pace in the two path, angled to the rail turning for home, took a narrow lead inside of foes nearing the
eighth pole but was outfinished from there. ALEXIS ZORBA (GB) had early speed inside, rated back nearing the turn, re-bid two wide between foes around
the bend, battled to midstretch the weakened. DUNDIE was reluctant to load, set the pace along the rail, drifted out turning for home and tired. POWER OF
JUSTICE broke slowly, advanced five wide around the turn and failed to sustain the bid in the lane. BEAR BEAR vied three wide between foes to upper
stretch and faded. AJAAYB failed to menace while racing three wide. KAKE'S ARROW stalked the early pace outside, launched a four wide bid around the
turn, reached near even terms nearing the quarter pole, vied to midstretch then was forced to check when in tight leaving the eighth pole.

Footnotes
STEEL RACER prompted the early pace in the four path, was roused into the turn, bid in the three path passing the quarter, took the lead while in the four
path just before the eighth pole, and drew clear. PRINCIPIA set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside into the turn, lost the lead while in the
two path to the eventual winner in upper stretch, and just held on for place. ESOTERIC stalked in the five path, was driven in the four path around the turn,
swung from the six path into the lane, and drifted out down the lane while finishing evenly for show. HITS DIFFERENT chased in the three path, was ridden
from the two path around the turn, and was one paced in the three path down the stretch. MILES OF SMILES raced off the pace in the five path, was driven
into the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and did not threaten. LUCKY PERIDOT trailed throughout from the four to eight paths.

while ridden out. TEST FACTOR pressed the pace three wide, reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths pole, battled through midstretch, was no
match for the winner late but won the duel for the place. FULANITO set a pressured pace along the rail, drifted out in midstretch and fought on to the wire
while just missing second. IKE'S GAMBLE raced off the pace three wide, angled widest in upper stretch and finished evenly. WILD CAUGHT dueled two
wide between foes and weakened in the lane. SOUPER CRUNCHY trailed inside.
