Footnotes
HAY CHIEF settled off the early pace to race near the back of the pack, ridden into the far turn racing near the rail, continued a rail bid in the stretch run and
finished well to edge clear under strong handling. RUNNING RIVER showed good early foot to set the early pace, raced well clear near the eighth pole three
deep and was wore down late in a game effort. VICTIM OF THE NITE checked soon after the start, dropped back to race mid pack early, raced from the
inside near the quarter pole, angled through the upper stretch to race off the inside and raced even late with no final bid. CHELONIAN stalked the pace,
raced three wide around the far turn, was five deep near the three sixteenths pole and moved up late to improve position. NO EASY DAYS rated along
early, raced from the inside around the far turn into the stretch and weakened. FUN LOVIN CRIMINAL void of early speed, moved up four to five wide into
the upper stretch and flattened out. GRAND PICK raced off the early going, was three to four wide around the far turn and had no late rally. STEELE
MONEY dropped back early, raced from the inside near the five sixteenths pole, was up heels near the quarter pole, checked sharply, angled out through
the drive and never threatened. BONDED settled off the early pace and failed to respond. HIPPODROME forwardly placed two deep and gave way.

outside and surged late in a game effort. TRUE BLUE PEARL stalked the pace, raced from the inside near the five sixteenths pole, was four wide near the
three sixteenths pole, shifted in and weakened late. FOOL YOURSELF was off a step slow, ridden three wide near the quarter pole and was empty racing
from the outside. TWEET AWAY ROBIN stalked the pace, ridden along three wide near the three eighths pole and faded. VIKING QUEEN dropped back to

POINT DUME quick to begin to set the early pace, built a long lead into the stretch and was kept to task under strong handling. MEDAGOOCH was bumped
at the start, raced two deep while tracking the leaders, angled out six wide into the lane and closed in gamely late for the place position. AVES MAKIN'
WAVES stalked the pace, saved ground and needed more in the drive. BROTHER LAD settled off the early pace, made a rail bid around the far turn
through the stretch and closed in mildly. BUCKIN' DREAMER stumbled at the break, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, hard ridden three
wide between near the quarter pole and was even with no final bid. KICK STARTNESS tracked the early leader two deep, was five wide near the three
sixteenths pole and faded. LIGHTNING STRIKING was bumped at the start, raced five wide around the far turn and never threatened. SHADOW MAN was
off slowly, raced near the inside near the five sixteenths pole, swung five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. THUNDERSLAM ducked out at
the start, raced near the back early and never was a factor. MIZTERGRANDCENTRAL was bumped at the start, raced near the rail around the far turn into
the upper stretch and was empty.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT RENEGADE raced off the early pace setters, moved up three wide near the quarter pole to challenge and finished well to draw clear while
racing from the outside under strong handling. GOODTIMETOBEIRISH dueled for the early lead from the outside of foe but was no match for the winner in
the final stages. THE BIG ENCHILADA dueled near the rail and weakened in the drive. KATIE'S NOTION chased the early pace from the inside, angled four
wide in the stretch run and raced even with no closing run.. BOX N BEN was coaxed along early, six deep near the three sixteenths pole and faded.
PORCH SWING dropped back early and failed to threaten.
