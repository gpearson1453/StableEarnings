Footnotes
PORTO DEL ACE was allowed to settle on the inside to midway through the final turn then angled out to four wide at the three sixteenths pole and ran down
the leader to prove best. CRIMSON GLORY rushed up the rail and cut the corner into the first turn to take the lead, set an easy pace to deep stretch but
was caught in the final jumps. TIME TO CLOSE prompted the pace from two or three wide while fighting gamely with HONEST DEAL to the final turn, kept
on but was outfinished by outside closer. RONA VISION was unhurried to the three furlong marker then moved up to make a late rally in the stretch but was
too late. SECRET GUITAR raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then made a three wide bid at the five sixteenths pole but faltered.
NATURALBORNSENDER raced five wide into the first turn then settled near the back and was not a factor. HONEST DEAL prompted the pace inside of
TIME TO CLOSE to the five sixteenths pole and weakened.

MEAN AMERICAN raced off the pace from the two path down the backstretch then engaged the leader around the final turn and took the lead at the three
sixteenths pole and drew off. HURRICANE TIZWAY went to the front under an easy pace to the final turn then picked up the challenge from MEAN
AMERICAN but couldn't fend off that one but proved second best. SABER QUEEN was allowed to settle down the backstretch then made a three wide bid
on the final turn but flattened out. DANCE LADY stalked the pace from three wide and finished evenly. SHESAHEATWAVE had an awkward start leaving
the gate and trailed the field to the first turn, made a mild bid on the backstretch but tired. TAYLOR'S SECRET tracked the leader while saving ground to no
avail.

pack from the inside to midway down the backstretch then moved between horses at the three furlong marker and made a late gain in the stretch but was
not enough. AMERICAN CHICK was allowed to settle down the backstretch then moved up from two wide on the final turn and made a rail bid in the stretch
but was too late. COZY COURTNEY raced near the back down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn for a late run and improve
position. SUGAR CANE GAL was allowed to settle around the first turn then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker but failed to sustain that bid.

Footnotes
MONITOR MILLS broke well and went to an unchallenged lead throughout to prove best. SARAH'S VISION raced off the pace down the backstretch on the
inside then fell back on the final turn but made a rebid to save the place. QUARTER RAT was forwardly placed from the two path down the backstretch
made a mild gain on the leader around the final turn but was no match for the winner. J C'S IN TOWN stalked the pace from three wide but lacked the late
response. GOTTATAKEHIMTO was unhurried to the final turn then made a three wide bid at the quarter pole, tipping out to four wide in upper stretch but
only passed tiring rivals. SWIFT N TRAFFIC tracked the leaders from the inside but was empty in the stretch. SABER STORM hopped outward leaving the
starting gate, moved up from three wide on the backstretch but was never a threat. MY BOOK remained back. NOW NOW MAN saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
TRUVY'S BANDIT chased the leaders from the inside then shifted out to four wide in upper stretch for a late run and was just up. WORK ALL DAY dueled
for the lead from the inside to mid stretch then edged away and was caught at the wire. RED IDOL showed no early speed, went three wide on the turn and
tipped out to five wide in upper stretch to make a late rally and missed. COUNTRY CAT JAKE dueled for the lead from two wide to mid stretch while fighting
gamely but weakened late. ARKANSAS ZONG dueled for the lead from four wide to the turn then moved in to three wide around the turn and tired in late
stretch. QUICK ZONG dueled for the lead from three wide to the quarter pole and gave way. FISHIN WITH PETE tracked the leaders from three wide to the
turn then saved ground around the turn but was not a threat.

GEORGIA DAWN raced in the middle of the pack on the inside around the first turn, steadily advanced down the backstretch and kept on to run down the
leader and drew clear late. IN THE RED stalked the pace to the seven sixteenths pole then took the lead before the three furlong marker and drew clear, but
was ran down in the stretch to be caught in the final yards. MIDNIGHT TRIP raced near the back around the first turn then saved ground down the
backstretch, moved out to three wide on the final turn, angled back inside in the stretch to be along for the show. ASHLEY'S GIRL was allowed to settle
down the backstretch then made a four wide bid on the final turn for a late rally. MSCHITCHATTOUR was unhurried to the final turn then started to circle the
field and was best of the rest. WATERS OF MEROM raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then moved between horses at the half pole for a
middle move but was empty in the stretch. TEASIN' TESLA vied for the early lead from three wide to the turn and retreated. HARLANS WARRIOR pressed
the pace from the two path to the three furlong marker and gave way. BEYOND THE HYPE went to a pressured lead but was through after a half.

LIGHTOFMAINE pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn then took a pressured lead at the half mile marker and was challenged to the
quarter pole then pulled away to prove best. SAVED BY GRACE was allowed to settle down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn
and moved between horses at the eighth pole to prove second best. PLUM WINE was unhurried down the backstretch then made a four wide bid on the
final turn for a late run but was too late. ONE LINE RULER raced off the pace to the top of the stretch but lacked the late response needed. SHE SMILED
AT ME was roused between horses to talk the lead into the first turn then pressed the pace from the inside to the final turn and tired.

Footnotes
MAGIC GLASS pressed the pace from three wide to the first turn then stalked the pace from three or four wide down the backstretch then made a four wide
bid on the final turn to engage the leaders at the three sixteenths pole and drew off. ROLL GYPSY ROLL saved ground to the top of the stretch then angled
out to five or six wide into the stretch and made a strong late rally. LAYLA'S SONG was pinched back in the early going then was unhurried around the first
turn, moved up from three wide down the backstretch and moved out to four wide in upper stretch for a late run for the show. APRIORITY CATCH raced in
the middle of the pack while saving ground around the final turn, tipped out to three wide in upper stretch but was outfinished. GAP DADDY had to steady
going into the first turn and bumped with HIGH DONNA, vied for the lead down the backstretch and engaged the leaders at the five sixteenths pole while
fighting gamely but weakened in the stretch. BOARDWALK QUEEN raced off the pace on the inside to the quarter pole while fading but finished evenly.
ZIPPING MOLLY rushed up to take the lead into the first turn then was headed at the five sixteenths pole and fought gamely to the eighth pole and gave
way. ILIMITADA rubbed the gate as she was leaving, then was allowed to settle but was never a threat. HIGH DONNA was bumped by GAP DADDY into
the first turn then vied for the lead from three wide down the backstretch and faded.
