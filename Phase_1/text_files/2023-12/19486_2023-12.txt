Footnotes
MIDNIGHT VOYAGE stalked the pace to the turn, rallied three wide to engage the leader in upper stretch and wore that one down through the drive.
CUSSIN N FUSSIN dueled on the lead from two wide, took command shaking off the dueling pacesetter turning for home, was immediately engaged by the
winner and battled that one to deep stretch in a game effort. OVER MY LIMIT unhurried in the early going to be well off the pace, found his best stride
turning for home and closed belatedly in the lane. XERXES tracked the leaders from the fence and made a mild rally in the stretch. SIR MASON dueled on
the lead from the rail to the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. INCITATUSWAY contended for a half mile and faded. SPYRO missed the break to give
the field a half dozen lengths and was always outrun from there having lost all chance at the gate.

OFFICIALLY YOURS stalked the pace from four wide to the turn, rallied to take command nearing the quarter pole, opened a clear advantage while drifting
out down the lane and pulled away convincingly. OH GLORIOUS DAY slow early to be at the back of the pack, circled the field from six wide rallying at the
top of the lane and closed well to gain the place. PRINCESS ELLIE broke slow to give the field several lengths from the gate, steadily advanced along the
fence in the turn, angled five wide turning for home and finished willingly. MY GIRL KEW prompted the pace from between horses through the turn while
under steady urging and lacked a closing response. IMA MOM showed early speed to be on the pace to the turn and weakened. PRETTY PATTY flashed
brief speed and was through early.

Footnotes
KAY BEE GEE settled in hand off the pace down the backside, began a steady advance while circling the field around the bend and closed well to be clear
late. J P'S GLADYS set the pace under early pressure, opened a clear lead on the bend to mid-stretch and could not hold off the closing winner. BASTET
unhurried early to be near the rear of the pack, worked through traffic down the lane and finished willingly with a belated rally. SWEET BELEN well placed
tracking the leaders from the fence through the turn and failed to gain ground in the drive. SHELLEY'S GEM rated in mid-pack to the turn, rallied six wide to
loom in upper stretch and was outkicked to the wire. SABELLE tracked the leaders through the turn, angled nnine wide turning for home and made a mild
bid through the lane. FLYING BUSINESS went evenly failing to menace. LA LIMA prompted the early pace from the inside and steadily faded from
contention. SUMMER STORM stalked the pace from three wide, made a bold bid on the turn and flattened out turning for home. GRAND PRIZE was never
a threat. WATERLOO SUNSET was not a factor. WAY TO FIRE contended for a half mile and tired.

DERBY DAY KISS stalked the pace early, dropped back on the bend to rally five wide turning for home and drew away convincingly in the stretch. CURLIN
PEARLS slow early to be well off the leaders, made a steady advance from the quarter pole through the lane to be gaining late. COMPUTE THIS prompted
the pace from the fence, saved ground through the turn to be prominent in upper stretch and lacked a closing response. MISS SPRINGSTEEN broke
outward bumping rivals to her outside leaving the gate, raced up between horses to be just of the pace into the turn, brushed with inside rival in the turn,
rallied from three wide turning for home, had to steady sharply when impeded by SPOOKY LITTLE GIRL in upper stretch, was gathered up and kept on in
tight quarters through the lane the victim of a very rough trip. POINTOF ATTRACTION raced four wide into the turn, rallied to threaten on the bend and
flattened out down the lane. SPOOKY LITTLE GIRL set the pace opening up on the turn, tired coming home wandering about in the stretch impeding a rival
at the three-sixteenth pole and finished evenly. SHAMANS IMAGE trailed most of the way and never threatened. COLLECT GOLD dropped back through
the turn and was not a factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND UPON REVIEW MADE NO CHANGE TO THE
ORDER OF FINISH.

BEACH FRONT away alertly, stalked the pace three wide into the turn, drew on even terms for the lead past the quarter pole, matched strides the balance
of the trip and proved best under a strong hand ride. MUTUAL CONFIDENCE pressed the pace two wide, dueled the length of the stretch but couldn't
handle the winner. MAXIMIZER sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished in the final
stages. T MONEY had a mild late rally in the five path. GATES OF HEAVEN found his best stride late. NYOMAN well placed, failed to respond. MY TWO
AUNT JOANS saved ground to no avail. CALL WEST was no factor. BLACK CANDY stalked pace the pace along the inside into the stretch and faded late.
KHOPILOT showed little. UNCLEJACKOMO was outrun.

Footnotes
PRIVATE DRIVE reserved off the early pace, saved ground through the turn, cut the corner coming home and pulled clear down the lane with a strong rail
rally. HENRY THE CAT broke inward bumping rival, settled while unhurried early on, rallied six wide in upper stretch and finished willingly. OL' NED pressed
the pace from two wide to the top of the lane, drifted in down the stretch while under left hand urging, impeded OHIO PLAYER and kept on to the wire.
CALBOYZEKE slow early to be near the rear and closed mildly in the stretch. OHIO PLAYER dueled on the lead from the rail, weakened in upper stretch
and steadied down the lane when intimidated by the rider of OL' NED's crop. MUTINY went evenly without threatening. UPGRADE AL stalked the pace for a
half mile and flattened out. WILDCAT BILL contended early and came up empty. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND
UPON REVIEW DISQUALIFIED OL' NED AND PLACED HIM FIFTH.

Footnotes
DASH OF FIRE reserved off the pace down the backside, was jostled in traffic into the turn, angled to the clear turning for home and steadily gained ground
down the lane to be up in time. LITTLE TOY GUNS stalked the pace through the turn, assumed command turning for home, opened a clear lead in
mid-stretch and was caught in the final strides. JIM'S RIVER RUNNER unhurried in the early going, circled eight wide to mount a belated rally down the
lane. CLEVELAND POWER raced at the rear of the main body of the field and made a late gain to hit the board. COLOR BEARER tracked the leaders into
the turn, made a bold three wide move in the turn to take the lead and flattened out in upper stretch. SMOOCHER broke slowly to be the distant trailer down
the backside, found his best stride turning for home and showed good late energy. ANIMO ROBERTO went on-paced and never posed a threat. AINT NO
BANDLEADER set a pressured pace to the quarter pole and gave way. STARS N SPACE pressed the pace early and tired.

Footnotes
SPECIALIZED stalked the pace through the turn, rallied in upper stretch being given a great trip under good handling and cleared late in the drive.
SOMEKINDAFUHRY tracked the leaders through the turn ranged up leaving the quarter pole to take a brief lead and was outkicked down the stretch while
being second best. CONSTITUTION COAL reserved off the pace early, loomed up from three wide at the head of the stretch and finished evenly. SWING
STATE pressed the pace into the turn, dropped back losing position through the bend and kept on lacking a closing response. PALACE TEMPTATION
settled off the leaders through the turn and made a mild late bid in the lane. LUCK OF THE CAT bumped at the start, was taken in hand to race mid-pack
and went evenly. ROLLIN SO PERFECT slow early to be the trailer and showed good late interest passing weakened rivals in the lane. BAD BOY BOOGIE
set the pace to the quarter pole and came up empty. TEQUILA FLATS raced mid-pack in contention through the turn and flattened out in the stretch. RED
COMET was never a factor.
