Footnotes
MACKVILLE set the pace in the two path, was roused from just off the rail midway around the turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the stretch, and
drew clear. FILM ACADEMY hopped at the start, tracked in the three path, was roused early around the turn, floated out to the six path turning into the lane,
and ran on for place. RAPID GREY stalked in the four path, was roused from the three path passing the three-eighths, but finished evenly in the stretch for
show. TIE BREAKER LENNIE had an awkward start, rated in the two path, was cued along the inside passing the three-eighths, swung from the four path
into the stretch, but was no factor. ART AND DESIGN chased in the four path, but had to be coaxed along passing the half, and did not threaten. LAST
POST prompted the pace inside but weakened in the stretch.

SHE'S OUTTA HERE stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the five-sixteenth pole, dueled outside of foes to midstretch then drove clear.
WHEELINGNDEALING pressed the pace two wide, dueled between foes around much of the turn, vied inside of the winner past the eighth pole and was
clearly second best. AWESOME ANNMARIE saved ground off the pace, swung five wide leaving the five-sixteenths marker and ran on to gain the show.
ROSE E HOLIDAY lagged inside, cut the corner into the lane, made some progress in upper stretch but was no threat. TROTTING GEAR set the pace
along the rail and weakened in the lane. BARGAINAIRE chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. ANOTHERDAYGONEBY chased the
pace four wide and faltered after a half.

ASHIMA settled up close on the outer hip of the pacesetter in the three path, bid confidently in the two path around the far turn, took command while being
roused from the four path into the stretch, and drew clear. WONDERFULVENEZUELA settled around the first turn to stalk in the two path, was coaxed
midway around the far turn, and chased on around the five path down the lane for place. BETTY rated in the two path, was coaxed in the three path midway
around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path entering the stretch, and kept on for show. UMBRAL raced off the pace inside, was cued midway around
the far turn, swung out to the six path at the top of the lane, but finished evenly. JAZZIN tracked in the three path, was ridden around the far turn, but
flattened in the stretch. NEW BABY set the pace in the two path, was cued along the inside into the far turn, but gaveway down the lane. MAELSTROM

GULLFAXI rated in the five path, ranged up in hand to bid midway around the turn, took command and was cued while tipping into the two path at the top of
the lane, and kicked away under light encouragement. OLIVIA'S SPARKLE chased in the four path, was ridden into the turn, floated out to the seven path
turning into the stretch, and chased on for place. MUSTHAVEBEENLOVE pressed in the three path, bid around the turn, but faded along the inside down
the lane to show. SHINING SKYE bobbled at the start, raced wellback in the three path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but was no
factor. DARLING DARLEY raced off the pace inside, floated out to six path turning into the lane, but never threatened. THE BIG BANSHEE set the pace in
the two path but had to steady while fading turning into the stretch, and was eased.

Footnotes
LEXINATOR saved ground off the pace, swung out in upper stretch, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. GET THE CANDY set the pace along the
rail and led until the final strides. SIX FEET APART had early speed inside, steadied nearing the seven-sixteenths marker, stalked the pace two wide,
steadied again near the three-eighths pole, angled three wide nearing the quarter pole, bid between foes in the stretch and was outfinished. BLAZINGLY
was off a step slowly, trailed inside, rallied along the rail and lacked ideal room late. ALA TURKA raced off the pace two and three wide and had a mild
belated rally. TALK MUCH pressed the pace three wide and tired in the lane. DEMURELY lacked early speed, angled out down the backstretch, was taken
six wide by a troubled rival early on the far turn and had no further bids. FLIP MY ID had early speed, took an awkward step and lost ground nearing the far
turn, took another awkward step around the turn, was pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
LOCO ABARRIO stalked in the five path, bid in the four path midway around the turn, took a short lead while floating out to the five path in upper stretch,
and dug in to hold off an outer foe. SUPER CHOW chased in the six path, was coaxed in the five path around the turn, took aim from the eight path at the
top of the lane, drifted out, and ran on for place. X Y POINT vied in the three path, took the lead under rousing passing the three-eighths, tipped out to the
five path turning into the lane, but evened out in the final furlong out for show. TICKING got fractious in the gate, rated in the four path, had to steady
passing the half, was ridden in the six path around the turn, but made no impact from the nine path in the stretch. REAL TALK prompted the pace in the four
path but flattened entering the stretch. RIBBONS AND MEDALS raced off the pace in the two path but never menaced. DOC AMSTER set the pace along
the inside but yielded around the turn.

Footnotes
STYLE POINTS stalked the pace two wide, took over near the quarter pole, shook clear in upper stretch and held safe under left-handed urging. STEEL
LUTE settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn and finished well to narrow the gap. LAURISTON (IRE) had her
head turned at the start then hesitated to break well behind the field, raced off the pace two wide while fighting the bit, edged closer two wide around the far
turn, tipped out in upper stretch and was along for the show. JUST MARYANN saved ground in range and lacked the needed rally. NO CONSEQUENCES
saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and never threatened. GOSSIPER trailed inside, swung out in upper stretch and was never a factor.
ROUND THE TOWN set the pace along the rail, was collared near the quarter pole and retreated through the lane. LITTLE MISS MUNNY raced in range
two wide, went four wide around the far turn and faltered.
