Footnotes
AKEMI closed to the lead approaching the five sixteenths pole, widened at the rail on the turn and held well under a vigorous hand ride. LITTLE BIT OF
THAT was shuffled back at the start but gave close chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and dug in to hold second. COACH
RUBE chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. LUNATIC was shuffled back at the start, gave chase through the backstretch,
rounded the turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. MY LOVELY GIRL was pinched back at the start then gave chase, rounded the turn about
the four path, raced outside into the lane and passed some rivals. GHOSTLY SQUALL veered in at the break, gave chase through the backstretch, raced off
the rail on the turn and weakened in the lane. ORGANIZED CHAOS was not a factor and rounded the turn about the six path. TIZ THE REASON ducked
out at the break, took a brief early lead then gave chase but faded at the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
MINISTRY OF MAGIC stumbled leaving the gate and raced in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily
progressed, rounded the far turn about the four path, dug in leaving the turn and inched ahead nearing the wire. REMYS SHOWTIME angled in and stalked
from the five eighths pole, took the lead approaching the half pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths, raced clear toward
the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane, but was caught inside the sixteenth pole and grudgingly ceded. SPUNMAN saved ground on the first turn,
picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the four path on the far turn, dug in to take third later yards and was gaining on the
runner-up. GREAT DAYS AHEAD took the lead at the rail into the first turn but was met approaching the half mile pole, gave chase through the backstretch
but dropped back leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened. YO VINNIE stalked from the three path, gave chase
leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened. ROCKIN THE PALACE raced well off the pace and off the rail the first turn then
eased out into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn wide and could only close the gap in the lane. SARGENT
KOBE saved ground.

two deep on the turn, was outfinished in the duel through the stretch but held on for second. TIME TO ROCK broke awkwardly then steadied, gave chase
through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the seven path and was closing well, but was taken in hand late. WHALE OF A RUN chased through the
backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. BRADLEY DO RIGHT gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened
inside the sixteenth pole. GREATEST NOTION chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn two deep then flattened in the lane. ESTRELLA FUGAZ

LIGHTNIN RUNNER took the lead at the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths,
rounded the far turn at the rail and was steadily handled in the lane. DULCIMER DAME settled close in the five path on the opening turn, picked up the
chase nearing the three quarter pole, raced in the four path on the far turn then dueled through the final sixteenth for second. AZZURRA hesitated at the
break and raced well back from early contention, left the first turn outside and gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the
five path and finished well for third while gaining on the runner-up. MOONLIT SHADOW stalked off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven
sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn then flattened in the lane. FULL MOON LOVER rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase approaching
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened inside the eighth pole. UNCAPTURED RUBY saved ground.
