Footnotes
FOR A LAUGH (IRE) stalked along the rail, tipped out into the lane, drew alongside GIOVINAZZO with a furlong remaining and proved best late.
GIOVINAZZO showed early speed from inside, set all the pace to the stretch, challenged at the eighth pole, resisted into deep stretch and yielded late.
FLAVIUS tracked two to the far turn, tipped three wide at the quarter pole, chased within striking range with a furlong remaining, faltered in the late stages
but managed to edge INDIAN PEAK for third. INDIAN PEAK settled inside at the back, shifted to the two path on the far turn but lacked room at the quarter
pole and altered back to the fence, put in a rail bid with a furlong remaining but flattened out. ORIGINAL broke well, raced up close in the two path, ridden
along on the far turn, started to lose ground past the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
GRAZEN IN THE SUN broke a step slow, chased from inside then angled out on the backstretch, bid four deep on the turn, dueled in upper stretch, put
away the runner-up past the eight pole and drew away. R GIRL'S WERTH IT raced up close on the inside then ceded to outer rivals, bid along the rail at the
five-sixteenths pole, took over approaching the quarter pole, dueled with GRAZEN IN THE SUN in upper stretch and was no match for that rival in the
furlong grounds. MISS COMMANDER forced to steady when GRAZEN IN THE SUN angled out early, chased three wide into the turn, angled down to the
inside around the bend, steered out in upper stretch and gained the show. WINK WISH AND PARK dueled inside a rival up the backstretch, vied two wide
around the bend and lost command outside the quarter pole, then weakened down the stretch. HOUSE OF TARGARYEN raced in range well off the rail,
rounded the bend five wide and weakened. THREE POINT OH dueled for the lead from outside to the turn, vied three deep on the bend, chased the leaders
past the quarter pole and weakened.

Footnotes
KRISTI'S TIGER raced in range up the backstretch, traveled along the rail into the turn, came under a ride around the bend while tipping out to the three
path, closed in on the leaders entering the final sixteenth and drove past. BLESSED TOUCH stalked three wide into the turn, bid three deep at the quarter
pole, took over approaching the final furlong, held a short lead into deep stretch but could not offer any resistance to the winner late. VITALERA (CHI) set
the pace up the backstretch outside LLORONA, lost command to that rival near the five-sixteenths pole, regained the lead at the quarter pole, relinquished
the lead to BLESSED TOUCH outside the furlong marker and stayed on for a clear third. LLORONA raced up close then pressed from inside early, took
over midway around the turn, lost command at the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. PROFESSORS' PRIDE hopped at the start spotting the field
several lengths, drew closer up the backstretch, raced two wide into the turn then moved over to the rail, drifted into the lane and had little left for the stretch
run. R SWIRVIN GIRVIN tracked widest early, went three then two wide on the turn, got floated out by PROFESSORS' PRIDE leaving the bend and
weakened.

Footnotes
RUGELACH vied between rivals up the backstretch and around the turn, inched ahead in upper stretch and edged away in the final sixteenth. FAST
GISELLE vied for command three deep to the top of the stretch, dueled outside RUGELACH to midstretch, yielded to that rival and stayed on to secure
second. RVALENTINA moved inside stalking the top trio, chased along the rail then lacked room while shifting to the two path at the quarter pole, lacked
room behind the leader again in upper stretch, moved to the inside to put in a mild bid but could not sustain the momentum late. STRANGE ADDICTION
broke a step slow, trailed early on the inside then inside rivals into the turn, advanced along the fence through the bend, angled out in upper stretch but
finished evenly late. READY JET GO sat off the pace off the rail then three deep into the turn, went between foes around the bend then two wide into the
stretch and could not rally. INNER BEAUTY (IRE) chased the leading trio outside a rival three wide into the turn, moved into the two path then came three
wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. GYPSY LYNN held a narrow lead early inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch, fought through the turn continuing to
save ground, lost command leaving the bend and weakened down the lane. ICE QUEEN chased out of range four wide into the turn, entered the lane three
wide and failed to menace. LITTLE LILIANA chased off the pace then between rivals into the turn, got crowded at the three eighths pole then drifted out on
the turn and was not persevered with.

angled five wide late on the bend, closed well from the middle portion of the track, took over midstretch and edged away. NAUVOO stalked the top pair from
outside, rounded the bend three then four wide, challenged between rivals midstretch but was outclosed by the winner. AFTERNOON HEAT laid off the
pace well off the inside, navigated the turn five then six wide, moved inward in the stretch and was along for the show honors. HANDR'SDREAM broke well
and chased for a bit before pressing from outside, dueled around the turn and inched ahead at the quarter pole, put away inner rival in upper stretch,
relinquished the lead midstretch and flattened to fourth. HIGH PRESS broke slow and came in at the start, chased out of range on the inside and failed to
respond when asked. WHOA BUDDY unhurried in the early going, took the turn four then three wide and failed to menace. TOM BOMBADIL sped clear
then set the pace inside HANDR'SDREAM up the backstretch, dueled with that rival and lost command at the quarter pole, failed to kick on with the leader
in upper stretch and weakened. MR. MASON tracked four wide into the turn, spun five wide into the lane, weakened and eased in the stretch and walked

RUBY NELL took control early and established a comfortable advantage on the inside, held a diminished lead into the far turn, kicked away again without
being urged, asked right handed entering the lane and responded by opening up in upper stretch, asked once left handed past the eighth pole and was
ridden out in the final sixteenth. JUSTIQUE raced well off the pace on the inside early, gained along the rail on the far turn, tipped three wide into the stretch,
finished willingly in the stretch to gain the place but could not threaten the winner. IRISH PATSY trailed on the inside into the first turn then went outside a
rival, rounded the far turn two to three wide and offered a mild response to gain the show. ANACARO broke well then took a stalking position in the two
path, moved to the rail on the far turn, came out a bit in upper stretch and weakened. CLIQUISH stalked along the rail, eased out to the four path on the far
turn and asked right handed but weakened down the lane. PRINCESS BETTINA stalked in the two path early, three deep in the middle stages, came back
to the two path on the far while closest in pursuit, then faded in the lane.

past the quarter pole, regained the lead while brushing with KISS FOR LULU near the eighth pole and held gamely to the wire. KISS FOR LULU ceded the
lead early then went up to press from outside, raced on even terms on the far turn and took over past the quarter pole, drifted in and brushed BABY
WAYLON near the eighth pole, battled into deep stretch and finished gamely in defeat. CLEMENTS RIDE broke a step slow then had to steady early,
traveled two wide then along the inside off the pace, tipped back to the two path on the far turn, closed well and gained the show. TWILIGHT MOON pulled
early on the inside early then drifted out into the first turn, steered back to the rail around the bend, saved ground through the far turn and could not rally in
the drive. TAKES THREE broke well then became rank when rated early and two then three wide on the first turn, stalked outside a rival through the second
bend, asked right handed entering the lane and finished evenly. JIMMY'S WILD BOY came away slow, chased outside a rival then three wide into the first
turn before moving to the inside, saved ground to the stretch, moved out in the lane and lacked a rally. RUN BRYCE RUN chased three deep into the first
turn then drifted out before being corrected, raced near the back on the backstretch, two wide into the far turn, angled out to the four path, steered back in
during the stretch run and failed to menace. DRIVE FOR SHOW chased between rivals then got floated out on the clubhouse turn, raced in mid-pack on the
backstretch, three deep on the far turn and weakened. MOTIVATING FORCE broke a step slow, raced outside rivals then altered out approaching the first
turn then got floated out early on the bend, advanced four then three deep on the far turn, then flattened out in the lane.
