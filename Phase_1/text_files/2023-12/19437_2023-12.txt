Footnotes
SERAPE vied three wide, then between horses turning for home as an outer rival offered a bid, got headed by that one in upper stretch, yet fought on
through the final furlong to forged an advantage in the closing stages. THETRUTHISTHETRUTH dropped her head as the gates sprung and broke multiple
lengths behind the leaders, recovered to track outside of the leading trio into the turn, ranged up to offer a bid nearing the lane, gained an advantage in
upper stretch, held sway from an inner persistent rival while hanging on his left lead through midstretch, but succumbed to that one in the final sixteenth.
MYFRIENDSAWINNER chased the leaders from the two path into the turn, trailed turning for home, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch and moved
up late. FOR REAL ALICE vied two wide and between horses but yielded. TRACK SMART vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals into the turn, then gave
way through the final furlong.

Footnotes
SWEET ALEXIS settled well back in the three path, advanced in the three to four path around the far turn before swinging to the seven path entering the
lane, then rallied with a good kick to reel in the clear leader in the final sixteenth. DAISY DE ORO lunged outwardly when her hind legs slipped at the start,
pulled forward in the four to three path to prompt outside of the leader entering the backstretch, settled into stride with nine sixteenths to go, bid and vied
into the far turn, led turning for home, drove clear nearing midstretch, but was worn down by an outer on-charging foe in the final sixteenth.
EVERYLITTLESINGH set the pace inside of a prompting rival while remaining a path off the inner rail, got headed by her outer counterpart at the five
sixteenths pole, fought on before failing to keep pace in midstretch, yet kept on to hold show. TAP IRON FIST pursued from midpack in the three path,
inched closer to the embattled leading pair around the far turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, but failed to sustain a rally along with an outer rival
in upper stretch and ran on mildly. LAWLESS TIMES tracked in the three path, chased in the two path along with an outer rival around the far turn, but
drifted to the five path straightening for home and yielded. RUNLIKELANIE broke a step slow and was taken in hand to avoid an inner rival at the start,
trailed along the inside, then in the four to six path around the far turn and improved position. PURSUIT L'HARMONIE tracked along the inside and faded
around the far turn. LIGHTENING MO broke a step slow and steadied when put to crowded quarters by an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace in
the two path, awaited racing room behind a tiring rival around the far turn, shifted three wide into upper stretch and made little impact. MIA ANTONIA broke
outwardly, pursued from midpack in the two path, chased under urging between horses around the far turn and gave way. PER LOUISIANA RULING 25246,
SWEET ALEXIS WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST TO UNPLACED FOR A MEDICATION VIOLATION.

Footnotes
BOOTSIE'S GALAXY prompted outside of the pace setter, vied in the three path around the turn, forged an advantage while well in hand at the quarter pole,
drifted to the five path coming under urging at the three sixteenths pole, then straightened course and drove clear before being put to hand late. DIXIE
STREET laid off of the pace in the two to three path, then ran on willingly between horses to edge place in the final sixteenth. IZZY'S BABY BOY tracked in
the four path, entered the lane in the five path, stayed on mildly while shifting ground inwardly, bid for place in the final sixteenth but was outfinished by an
inner rival. CHARLI MICHAEL set the pace in the two path, clung to an advantage from the eventual winner around the turn, got headed entering the land
and tired through the final furlong. HAIL STATE chased along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE JEN tracked three wide, bid in upper stretch, vied into deep stretch, forged an advantage as an outer rival offered a bid in the closing stages and
held. BEAUTIFUL ENDING broke awkwardly, laid off of the pace in the two path, smoothly shifted out to take aim in the five path at the three sixteenths
pole, sustained a grinding charge to produce a bid in the final sixteenth but was denied. CALAJA was antsy in the starting gate, then bumped with an inner
rival at the start, stalked two wide, bid along with an outer foe in upper stretch, vied with that one leaving the furlong grounds, but was bested by her outer
counterpart and a wider bidder in the late stages. MI LIA tracked along the inside, lacked a rail seam in upper stretch, tipped to aim between horses leaving
the furlong grounds, but lacked a hole again and was blocked through the final sixteenth. KENYA STRIKE saved ground well back, shifted from the three to
five path while between horses in midstretch and stayed on while one paced through the late stages. OUR LITTLE GIRL bumped with an inner rival at the
start, raced at the rear in the two to three path, fanned out to the eight path entering the lane and moved up. SUMMERTIME BANDIT set the pace along the
inside, but yielded to an outer bidding pair at the furlong grounds and faded. DARLING JOANNA bumped with an outer rival at the start, pursued from
midpack four wide, then in the three path and between horses around the far turn and lacked a bid. PAT HAND GIRL leaned out and bumped a rival at the
start, tracked two wide and between horses, but faded to trail the field turning for home and made little impact thereafter. ZEEROCK bumped with rivals on
both sides a the start, raced at the rear in the three to five path, moved forward into the far turn, pursued from midpack in the four path turning for home
before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, and weakened.

Footnotes
TOUCHUPONASTAR set the pace in the three path, felt mild pressure from an outer rival down the backstretch, maintained an advantage from that one
around the far turn, drew clear in upper stretch, held sway under mild urging then lasted safely to the wire. TUMBARUMBA stalked outside of the leader and
from the four path, applied moderate pressure down the backstretch and into the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, sustained
a chase to close back in on that one in the late stages, but was only second best. COSMIC TRAIN trailed and improved past a tiring rival entering the lane.
BAYOU JAM tracked the top pair from the inside but weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
CALICOCO sped clear, showed the way in the three path around both turns, then drove further away through the final furlong. COMMANDER SCOTT
tracked in the three path, was brushed to the five path by an inner rival entering the lane, vied for place with that one through the final furlong and edged
that position late. MOMENT OF STARDOM pursued from midpack three wide, then stayed on inside of rivals to narrowly reach show at the wire. MI
SOLUTION stalked in the two path, brushed an outer rival shifting to the four path entering the lane, vied for place with that one through the final furlong, but
yielded late and was nailed by an inner bidder for show. GREAT COOLNESS was off slowly while getting rank leaving the gates, laid off of the pace along
the inside, shifted out turning for home, then to the five path and between horses in upper stretch and ran on while one paced. STIFF DRINK laid off of the
pace in the four path, then lacked a bid in the six path. I DON'T VENMO pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, but failed to sustain position
among foes down the backstretch and faded. CAJUN AMI saved ground in midpack but to no avail. FRENCHY DEPARTED broke a step slow and never got
involved. GO BROTHER GO was outrun.

GOOD AND STOUT tracked along the inside, advanced to be behind the leading pair entering the lane, bumped an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole to
split those foes and offer a bid at the furlong grounds, drove clear entering the final sixteenth, then lasted from an inner on-charging foe. EL DINERO took
light contact from an inner rival soon after the start, trailed early on, picked up stride in the two path around the turn, swung out to the five path entering the
lane, but lugged inwardly in upper stretch, yet offered a quick rail rally through the final furlong, surged late to offer a bid at the wire but missed via a tight
photo. SOUNDS LIKE POWER raced off of the pace in the two path, checked to maneuver around a faltering foe approaching the half mile pole, shifted five
wide entering the lane, then produced a steady rally while hanging on his left lead, reached show in the late stages, leveled off and held that position.
SPINNING ACES broke outwardly, pursued from midpack four wide, then ran on between horses to miss show. PRODIGY PARADISE set the pace along
the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner at the furlong grounds and gave way. STRONG PROMISE stalked four to three wide, bid outside of the
leader turning for home, but failed to maintain even terms at the quarter pole, took contact from an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole and faded between
horses through the final furlong. RISING KOTO STAR raced forwardly in the two path, but faltered between horses into the turn. STOVALL pressed four to
three wide, then two wide and between horses into the turn, but weakened turning for home. HYMN FOR CARLOS raced forwardly three wide and between
horses, but steadied while uncomfortable among foes at the nine sixteenths pole, faltered to the rear into the turn and was done early.

BEHEMAH STAR leaned in and brushed an inner rival at the start, prompted outside of the pace setter, vied before forging an advantage entering the far
turn, drew clear in the three path entering the lane and held firm from an outer pursuer through the final furlong. WHO TOOK THE MONEY rated at the rear
in the three path, advanced in the five path and outside of foes approaching the far turn, sustained a rally to gain place at the furlong grounds, then chased
the well-traveling leader home to prove second best. WOODS N WATER brushed with an inner rival then an outer foe at the start, tracked in the four path,
stalked within striking range three wide and between foes around the far turn, vied for place in pursuit of the clear leader through upper stretch, but was
outkicked by an outer counterpart in the final furlong. BUDRO TALKING settled at the rear in the two path, shifted from the three to five path while between
horses in midstretch and ran on for a minor share. REGAL KINGDOM brushed with an outer rival then an inner foe upon leaving the gates, laid off of the
pace two to three wide, got floated to the six path in midstretch and failed to menace. REAL CITY SPEED brushed an outer rival at the start, tracked three to
two wide and between horses, then chased entering the lane before yielding through the final furlong. SONYA KNOWS BETTER set the pace inside of a
prompting foe, got headed into the far turn and weakened in upper stretch. SILVER GALAXY pursued from midpack along the inside but faded turning for

brushed with an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack two wide into the first turn, then along the inside around the far turn, gained place from an
outer rival in upper stretch and was second best. SABRA TUFF tracked three wide, chased in the four path around the far turn, and kept on one paced to
edge show in the final furlong. FORT POLK pursued the main group from the four path, shifted five wide in upper stretch and moved up. STAR MOMENT
brushed an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, took aim as the clear leader's closest pursuer around the far turn, but lacked a bid before fading

OVA CHARGED stalked in the three path and between horses, bid around the turn before forging an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear in
midstretch, got collared by an outer bidder in the shadow of the wire yet narrowly held. BASALT STREET prompted two wide then along the inside after a
quarter mile, backed off the leader to stalk from the pocket into the turn, tipped outside of the leading pair in upper stretch, sustained a grinding charge to
close in on the clear leader and offer a late bid, but missed via a very close photo. SPIRITED BEAUTY blew the start and broke many lengths behind the
rest, trailed, cut the gap along the inside entering the lane, sustained a rail rally before shifting out in the final furlong and gained show late. BELEOUT
leaned out at the start, showed speed four wide, led two wide at the half mile pole, tucked to the inside into the turn, but was headed by an outer bidder
turning for home and faded through the final furlong. FREE DROP MADDY came out at the start, chased from midpack along the inside, shifted from the
three to six path turning for home and failed to menace. OLIVIA G laid off of the pace shifting out to the four path into the turn, but was floated to the six path
while between horses turning for home, shifted inwardly entering the lane and failed to factor. SPEEDY DUDETTE made little impact while hung in the five
to seven path around the turn. MISS PRIORITY broke a step slow, stalked in the four path and from within striking range around the turn, but gave way in
the five path entering the lane and weakened between horses.

Footnotes
CARPIS set a clear pace around the turn, widened in upper stretch and held sway. WISH CAREFULLY leaned inwardly at the start, tracked along the
inside, split foes in the four path in upper stretch and ran on willingly to prove second best. COURT JESTER saved ground off of the pace and moved up.
BOBBY TWO SHOT'S raced forwardly in the two path, chased on his left lead in upper stretch and tired. COAL COAL BEER lacked speed along the inside
and improved through the lane. STAR STAR STAR pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, but gave way turning for home then surpassed
tiring rivals. CYPRESS GOLD broke a step slow and failed to factor from the four path. HANDSOME HAROLD was bumped by an inner rival at the start,
recovered to stalk in the three path, but drifted to the five path entering the lane and weakened while hanging on his left lead. HOUSE BOURBON broke
outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses and faded. ESSENTIAL STAR blew the start, gained in the five
to four path into the turn, but weakened through the lane. SPRINGTOWN pursued from midpack three wide, chased under urging between horses turning
for home and weakened. BITSY'S STAR was outrun along the inside.
