Footnotes
ALMASHRIQ raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, edged clear while saving ground around the far bend and
held that margin to the wire. KUHL STAR saved ground around the first bend, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
from the two path and chased on to the finish. MISTER WINSTON saved ground early, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in
the two path and gave way in the lane. KHOZANDO raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the second bend and was outkicked in the stretch. SEVENTY SEVENTYCAT was pinched back leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the
pack on the outside through the opening half mile, began a bid headed into the far turn, raced in the three path from there and flattened out in the lane.
COMMANDER KEITH raced in the three path early, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, came around the far
bend still in the three path and was empty from there. SICILIA MIKE raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved
ground around the second turn and was never a factor.

the stretch to narrowly miss. HIPATIA raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the
quarter pole and gained ground late. CHIEF LADY bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the way between horses up the

early going, saved ground around the turn and never threatened. MONEYSLOT raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated
the turn from the three path and made no bid. FORTY MINER bumped with the horse to her outside at the start, stalked the pace setters from the rail up the

ECONOMICS dueled between horses early, continued to battle while saving ground around the bend and dug in in the stretch, getting caught near the wire.
LADY KHOZ hopped up mildly leaving the gate, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and kept on to the finish.
SHEZA NASTY GIRL raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the five path coming around the
turn and improved position from there. RETIRED KATHY raced at the back of the pack through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the three
path and improved position in the stretch. MACHO GIRL reared up leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the bend in the four
path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and made up some ground in the stretch while never truly threatening. MOR FOXY veered in and bumped
with the horse to her inside at the break, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and
faded in the stretch. HARD SPICE was bumped by the horse to her outside leaving the gate and pinched back, raced off the pace early, navigated the turn

Footnotes
LITTLE GIA raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three path and
kicked clear in the lane. GRANDMA'S PUDDING raced in the four path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside up the
backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the far bend and chased the winner home to the wire. BABY LUCK raced in the two path early,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, swung out to the four path coming around the far turn, began a bid passing the
quarter pole and gained ground late. PEACE FIRE saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch,
came around the far bend in the two path and improved position in the lane. WORKIN ECLIPTICAL raced in the two path around the first bend, pressed the
pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and faded in the stretch. SUSIE'S SAVER tracked the leader on
the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and weakened in the lane. CALISUE raced in the two path
early, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn still in the two path and passed tiring horses in the stretch
while never threatening. GO MIKA saved ground around the first bend, led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far turn
and tired in the stretch. SYLLABUS raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the far turn and made
no bid. ROB THE TREASURE raced in the two and three path around the first turn, settled at the back of the pack between horses from there, continued
around the second bend in the three path and was empty in the stretch.
