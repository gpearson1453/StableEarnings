Footnotes
ICE CUBE BABY broke a step slow, recovered and edged up along the rail past the five eighths, was rated along into the turn, awaited room near the
quarter pole, found clear sailing soon into the lane, stayed inside, closed determinedly under right handed pressure, took command inside the sixteenth
marker and held firm. FOR CRYIN OUT LOUD stalked the dueling leaders while three wide, was asked for run leaving the three eighths, collared foes soon
after, wrested command outside NEED A MARKER entering the lane, shook clear under pressure, remained on her left lead to deep stretch, dug in once
headed and continued gamely to the wire. SANSA ARIEL chased the pace while off the rail and between rivals, continued between runners while advancing
past mid stretch and kept on with good energy to earn the show. SHINY SLAM , three to four wide, moved up past mid stretch but was out kicked for the
show. IRISH LACE , between rivals leaving the far turn, dropped in then moved back out past the five sixteenths, checked behind rivals entering the stretch,
altered in near mid stretch and kept on with interest. SULLIVAN STREET , bumped at the break, was under a ride four wide past the five sixteenths, shifted
six wide for the drive but lacked a serious finish. IN GOOD TROUBLE stalked inside, angled three wide into the lane, lacked a punch past the three
sixteenths and faded. ELLIE VICTORINA , bumped and pinched back at the break, saved ground leaving the far turn, was angled five wide for the drive but
failed to muster up the needed kick. BACKSTREET GAL drifted in at the break bumping with a rival then was outrun. NEED A MARKER , sent up early,
dueled to the inside of a rival, held a slim advantage past the five sixteenths, ceded command into the lane and weakened in mid stretch. SULTRY SALLY H
disputed the pace two wide outside NEED A MARKER, failed to kick on approaching the quarter pole and retreated.

Footnotes
BATTLE OF BASTOGNE , rated near the inner rail down the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn, challenged for the lead between horses in mid
stretch and determinedly prevailed in an extended drive. BAND CAMP , four deep around the turn, challenged for the lead outside the winner in mid stretch,
finished gamely but was not good enough. I KNOW stalked the pace three wide around the turn, remained on his left lead in the stretch and failed to rally in
even effort. THE LAST JUMPSTART lacked speed, raced in the two path between horses on the turn, moved to the four path in upper stretch and passed
tired rivals. DOWSING ROD hugged the inner rail on the turn, eased out, raced between horses in the drive and passed tired ones. RUFFNER held a two
wide lead leaving the backstretch, opened up on the turn and tired the final furlong. ARMY RANGER , four deep on the turn, was no factor.
THUNDERHOUSE , three wide on the turn, lacked a rally. BOY IS IT HOT was outrun. MOONSET , four deep on the turn, gave way. WAR ROCKET , sent
up along the inner rail down the backstretch, faltered in upper stretch.

CLAIM , off a bit slow after breaking outward and bumping with a rival, corrected and edged up to the inside of runners past the five eighths, steadied off
heels into the turn, angled out past the five sixteenths, straightened to be about five wide, closed steadily and dug in late to preserve the place. JOHN HALL
, outrun early, saved ground into the lane, angled out, split foes with a run past mid stretch, shifted in and kept on gamely. AMITY ROAD , urged along in the
clear near the half, saved ground past the quarter pole, angled out leaving the three sixteenths and churned on. TIZ NO CLOWN , coaxed along chasing to
the inside of a rival, saved ground into the stretch, steadied when in close in mid stretch, altered out and kept on with effort. SWIFTY DEVIL stalked outside
a rival, came three wide with pursuit into the lane, had his rider lose his whip in mid stretch and faded. FRIGHTLAND , bumped at the start, lagged off the
pace while off the inside, raced a bit erratically leaving the far turn, shifted five to six wide, moved up some past mid stretch then flattened out.

Footnotes
PARADISE PRIDE , three deep entering the first turn, set the pace in the two path down the backstretch and around the far turn, eagerly pulled away
through the stretch and responded to brisk urging in mid stretch. MONYINTHEBANKSEY hugged the inner rail, prompted the pace to the stretch, was no
match for the winner and gamely held the place. ACE NINE NINE , off the rail down the backstretch, had aim on the lead while in the two path around the far
turn and gave way through the stretch. SHOOT THEMESSENGER raced along the inner rail on both turns, angled out in the stretch and failed to rally.
TRANSFER THE FUNDS , along the inner rail most of the trip, was no factor. WALK AWAY JOE raced in the two path between horses on the far turn and
was never a facteor. FERMAT , very wide leaving the far turn, was outrun. FORMAL ORDER , outrun, angled four wide leaving the far turn. BRASSTOWN ,
unhurried early, was four wide the first turn. ANTIPOISON , four wide the first turn, chased the pace, circled the far turn three wide, weakened and was
eased.

Footnotes
DANCINONTHEBEACH vied inside a rival while under rating, spurted away after being asked into the lane, widened under right handed ask then held sway
while kept alert. HONOR THE TRUTH , off the pace while saving ground, eased out into the lane, split rivals leaving the three sixteenths, was guided well
out in the track past the furlong grounds, straightened away and finished strong. ASHLEE'S RING , three deep early, stalked outside a rival around the turn,
shifted wider for the drive and kept on with interest to earn the show. BALI HAI broke a bit slow, rushed up between runners soon after, stalked to the inside
of ASHLEE'S RING around the turn, came out some for the drive and continued with effort between foes. MAIL CALL saved ground stalking the leaders,
steadied back a bit into the turn, regrouped to make a rail run past mid stretch then flattened out very late. CORA'S CHOICE disputed the pace outside the
winner, moved to a short lead around the turn, ceded command entering the lane, stayed willingly past the furlong grounds then weakened in the final
sixteenth. BALI MOON , between runners early, swung wide for the drive but failed to menace. GOODBYE KYLE saved ground without threatening.
FASHIONISTA , off the pace, angled six wide into the stretch but failed to rally. CHASING ARTEMIS , five wide in upper stretch, was not a threat. POLICE
WOMAN , off the pace, circled six to seven wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. HARPER'S DO was outrun.

Footnotes
SEVEN'S ELEVEN broke a bit awkwardly, saved ground in hand waiting for room on the turn, found a nice opening inside BERKS entering the stretch,
remained on his left lead, opened up and prevailed with something in reserve. ARMANDO R , outrun to upper stretch, swung to the seven path near the
eighth pole and rallied outside horses. SUPREME LAW stalked the pace, was well placed in the two path between horses leaving the turn and finished
willingly. IT'S VIPER , five deep on the turn, moved up a bit approaching the stretch and failed to sustain the bid. BERKS , clear leaving the backstretch, set
the pace near the inner rail, drifted to the two path approaching the stretch and gave way. TUNE IN hugged the inner rail around the turn and failed to rally.
YOUR ANALYSIS , outrun, swung to the five path in upper stretch. CURLIN'S MALIBU , no factor, drifted to the six path in upper stretch. UNCLE IRISH
circled foes on the turn stalking the pace, was four deep approaching the stretch and gave way. GOING TO THE LEAD , in the three path chasing the pace
on the turn, faltered.

MISSION BEACH , brushed at the break and off a bit slow, was patiently handled off the pace while saving ground, came under a ride past the five
sixteenths, eased out into the lane, advanced between rivals while under firm asking inside the furlong grounds, forged clear leaving the sixteenth pole then
held firm while kept alert. UNCLE CAT drifted in a bit at the break and made contact with the winner, chased to the inside of a rival mid turn, shifted four
wide into the lane, rallied outside rivals while on his left lead and gained the place. FORCE OF JUSTICE bobbled at the break, prompted the pace outside
the leader, moved in hand to engage past the quarter pole, was roused clear inside the three sixteenths, failed to withstand the winner inside the furlong
grounds and faded. I KNOW MAP broke a step slow, raced off the pace, steadied off heels into the turn, came under a ride mid turn, angled in through the
stretch but lacked a rally. NANCY MADE MY DAY chased off the inside, came five wide for the drive but failed to kick on. ONE WAY TRAFFIC broke on top
despite a slight bobbled, was nudged clear early then secured the inside, set a rated pace around the turn, failed to deny a challenge soon into the lane,
kept on to mid stretch then weakened through the final seventy yards.

Footnotes
EL DE CHIMI saved ground the first turn, stalked the pace inside horses, advanced in the two path leaving the far turn, swung to the four path in upper
stretch, rallied outside foes and was up near the finish. PRINS FIRE , clear mid way down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail, was hooked in upper
stretch and gave way grudingly. FEDERAL OFFENSE , four deep sprinting to the lead on the first turn, raced forwardly in the two path around the far turn,
bid for the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. LIGHTNING LAD lacked speed, circled the far turn three wide, was fanned five deep in upper stretch and
failed to menace. SHOULDHAVEBEENGONE dropped back on the far turn then passed tired horses. RUSHIN TOTHECIRCLE stalked the pace down the
backstretch, was well placed in the two path in side horses on the far turn then weakened through the lane. SUCCEED , never a factor, steadied lacking
room along the inner rail entering the far turn. MOON SIGN bore out leaving the starting gate, chased the pace for a half mile and tired. BOLD HONOR ,
pinched back leaving the starting gate, circled three deep the far turn, weakened and was eased.
