Footnotes
SAMARONTI settled far behind inside, angled out rallying on the final turn then drew away in the stretch under moderate urging. LOOK OUT LAMBO rated
early, bid three wide to the front nesting the quarter pole then proved no match for the winner. HIBACHI chased off the pace inside, moved out in stretch and
was up for the show. THE TWINS SNEAKERS dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. CITY RAGE set a pressured pace inside then was
finished after three quarters. MUNDO MIX prompted the pacesetter outside then stopped through the stretch. FIRE'S FINALE urged close up wide in the
opening half mile then retreated. WIZARD SERRAT lagged far behind wide and lost contact with his field.

IRISH COCO far behind early, advanced wide on the turn, closed strongly through the stretch to get up in time. CONFIRMED STAR stumbled at the start,
rushed to the front, engaged in pair of duels and finished determinedly in a game try. CAST YOUR NET rallied just off the pace outside, reached even terms
in midstretch then weakened slightly. MIDNIGHT WONDER forced the pace along the inside to near the eighth pole and faltered. JETS' DREAM saved
ground off the pace and flattened out in the stretch. KATE'S CUBAN KISS broke very slowly then trailed throughout.

early, advanced wide and made a gradual late gain. BRUNO BARBER GIRL chased close up in the two path, faded briefly on the turn then came again.
WICKED LADY set a pressured pace inside for half a mile then proved empty. COLETTE'S SPIRIT prompted the pace between rivals to midway on the turn
and faded. INCOMPARABLE trailed for half a mile, raced very wide and was never a factor. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS flashed speed along the rail then
gave way readily. LUCKY BREEZE dropped back outside and weakened steadily.

STAFF SERGEANT raced seven or eight wide into the first turn, then opened up a comfortable lead, showed the way on the far turn, responded when
roused, dug in gamely in the stretch run and held on determinedly inside. AFY KID stalked two wide, advanced on the far turn, rallied outside entering the
stretch, closed the gap in the final furlong but needed more late. UNION REWARD raced four wide early, then settled off the pace inside, chased on the far
turn and rallied mildly on the rail. BOINTHEBACK was outrun early on the inside, angled out entering the stretch and closed belatedly for fourth. BOOK
MARKER raced five wide early, settled three wide off the pace, chased on the far turn and had no rally. STEVIE T raced off the pace inside, chased on the
far turn and lacked a rally. KANE was outrun early racing two wide and did not factor. LOGAN'S RUNNER was in a bit tight entering the first turn, then

Footnotes
ANGELUS WARRIOR set a measured pace, moved clear after the half and edged away under steady handling. MUCHO MACHO EDDIE went after winner
on the final turn, loomed a threat but was second best. SOPHOS settled wide off the leaders, was asked for run on the turn and offered a mild bid. CELTIC
TREASURE steadied along with five and one half furlongs left then had no kick. INDOCTRINATE dropped off the pace near the inside and was never a
factor. AMOUNT trailed far behind then passed stopping rival. HENRYTHETHIRD prompted the pace inside to the far turn and gave way.

MOVISITOR broke alertly and quickly moved clear, eagerly widened in hand on the turn, drifted out in the stretch while remaining safe and was ridden out.
ADERO outrun early, advanced inside and gamely held the place. PRINCE OF RAIN dropped far behind, raced wide and closed well narrowing the gap.
ONE MORE SCOOP was blocked and steadied along from the five sixteenths to the stretch, angled out and closed well. DIDINGER was urged in the two
path in second flight and flattened out in the stretch. VEESON dropped back early, moved very wide on the turn and stretch. YODEL E. A. WHO trailed far
behind then passed rivals without menacing. PRAETORIAN GUARD lacked speed inside and was never in contention. DONTMESAWITHME prompted the
pace outside then was finished after half mile. ELOQUIST raced close up inside, stopped on the turn, was taken up fading at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SANDY Q stalked three wide, bid three wide on the turn, took over, drew off and widened under urging. BIONIC KAT set the pace on the inside, dueled
briefly on the turn, dropped back, then came again in the stretch run, dug in gamely late and earned the place award. FILLY PHANATIC raced off the pace
with an inside trip, rallied mildly on the rail in the final furlong and just missed for second. SECRET TEMPTATION chased four wide early, chased on the
turn, came four wide into the stretch and rallied mildly outside. ONLY GIRL checked soon after the start, raced off the pace, advanced three wide on the
turn, then checked sharply at the five sixteenths marker, came four wide into the lane and closed belatedly. YELOMA stalked close up two wide, bid
between rivals on the turn and faded in the stretch. ORB'S PARTY GIRL chased outside, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane and tired. FAUX
PAS raced three wide off the pace, three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. THE BAWSE'S LADY steadied at the start, was outrun early and did not factor.
KISSIT raced off the pace between rivals and failed to threaten. ELEGANTDREAM raced off the pace inside and did not factor. DARLING CAT raced off the
pace between rivals, gave way and was eased up in deep stretch.
