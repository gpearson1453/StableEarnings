Footnotes
LEMON BOMB pressed leader to the quarter pole, kicked in to surge clear as tons the best to the wire under solid handling. CANDY KICK inside run to turn,
angled out with a late kick to garner place. LADY LIVERMORE split horses for the lead, opened up to stretch but weakened in the late going for the show
spot. MYGALJUSTICE no speed to the turn, rallied along in the stretch to improve position. MISS SOVELIA wide run into the stretch while evenly
throughout with no kick. DALTON'S LOVE never a menaced throughout. AWESOME VALOR chased to the turn outside with nothing left for the stretch run.
TIZ BIZ inside run to the turn, faded in the stretch run. KAIYAS SONG slow into stride while showing little throughout. SLENDER BETSY wide run to the turn
while fading back readily. MAXIMUM JOY never factored throughout.

Footnotes
GREAT RICHIE M secured good position to quarter pole, rallied in earnest through the run, battled along to the wire. PRINCE COLTON no speed to the
turn, came running late to just miss. FEAR AND LOATHING unhurried early, responded well from the turn, ran on for show. MONEY MEMOLO broke slow,
raced back tired, turn, ran on gamely to improve. STONE'S THROW sharp outside to press top pair to the turn, raced on evenly late. MASTER SWITCH
never a real menace throughout. WEDNESDAY AT SHADY sprinted to the front, dueled to stretch weakened in late going. WHERE IS LISA broke slow,
raced back to the turn with nothing left in the drive. KYKEON split horses to challenge and duel to the turn, weakened late. BIBI BOSS along evenly to turn
but emptied out in the stretch run. WOODFORD HOLLER tried to keep up outside to the turn with nothing left and faded. THISISRIDICULOUS through early
from inside run to the turn.

Footnotes
ROCK WITH YOU set the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane, shook free nearing the eighth pole and drew away in the final stages. SPANISH
DOUBLOON broke a tad slow at the start, fanned into the eight path entering the lane and had a large stretch run. CENTAURO raced back early on, was in
the four path into the lane with a belated gain in the stretch drive. STEP ON IT hit the gate at the start, was in the six path into the lane with a mild gain in
the stretch. SECESSION bobbled at the start, chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the
drive. SHOCKWAVE was in the five path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch. RUN FOR REAGAN pressed the pace early, was in the four path
into the lane and faded late. SHANNONRUN was never a threat. SILVER BULL was never a factor. AWFUL BUT LAWFUL was bumped at the start and
done early. BALAMOR was through after a half. HAWAIIAN HIDE AWAY trailed the field throughout.
