Footnotes
GOLDEN PURCHASE showed some early speed then was well placed just behind the leaders, chased in the three then four path on the turn, took the lead
while floating six wide into upper stretch, drifted out significantly under a right-handed crop while remaining on his inside lead to the finish and proved best
under strong urging. NO SURRENDER bumped twice with a rival at the start, contested the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, led into
the stretch then lost the advantage to the winner near the three-sixteenths, remained on his inside lead in the drive and was outfinished while clear for the
place. GROWTH MINDSET disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path while roused on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired
but held the show. I LOVE CARA bumped twice with a foe at the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and lacked the
needed response. UNION TAP dropped back quickly despite being hustled then was ridden along on the outside, moved from four to six wide on the turn
and was no factor. A LISTER chased the pace on the outside, dropped back in the four path on the turn and capitulated. ELEVATED CAUSEWAY was
hustled from the gate, settled under some urging, fell well behind while inside on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
DUKE OF GLOUCESTER chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, seized command at
the three-sixteenths, brushed his main danger a furlong out and was headed for command nearing the sixteenth marker, had that rival come inwards and
was carried in two paths taking back a narrow command gamely in the final strides to the wire. THANK YOU JON chased four then three wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied to latch on the leader inside the three-sixteenths and was brushed by that rival a
furlong out, took narrow and brief command a sixteenth from home and came inwards under a right handed stick carrying in his main rival and was denied at
the end. MASTERWORK chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the
show honors. FACE ABARRIO showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch,
yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go and weakened in the late stages. OPPORTUNITY SET coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home, weakened in the stretch. DEPUTY CONNECT chased five paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing half a mile from home, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
KUNSHAN BRIDGE was hustled from the gate then urged along at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive,
rallied in the final furlong and closed well to get up late and prevail. CAUSES TROUBLE was hustled from the start, chased the pace down the backstretch,
made a brief bid near the half-mile pole, pursued the leader in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, drifted out under a
left-handed crop outside the furlong marker then was switched to a right-handed crop, took the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole, led into the final
seventy yards but was caught while clear for the place. KINGDOM was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in
the two path on the turn, was set down into upper stretch, came under the crop inside the three-sixteenths, led into the final furlong then weakened and was
overtaken but clearly held the show. BOBBY THE TANK tracked the pace down the backstretch, raced between foes passing the half-mile pole, dropped
back under urging in the four path on the turn and lacked the needed kick. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE stalked the pace on the outside, dropped back while
urged five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. BURN JAKEY BURN was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the inside, dropped back
while saving ground on the turn and tired.

HANG TIGHT just off the inside through the first turn, settled three wide down the backstretch in pursuit from the tail of the field, went four wide through the
far turn given some rein to work with but otherwise patiently handled until let out swinging seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily
gaining to arrive into contention inside the final sixteenth and was up in the last jumps to score. COOL QUARTET three then two wide through the first turn,
chased three then four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a
challenge inside the final furlong, seized command loosely between foes inside the final sixteenth before getting nailed in the final strides. ACHILLES HEEL
four then three wide through the first turn, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive taking command a sixteenth from home, dug in and was caught with seventy yards to the finish by a pair and forced to settle for the show
honors. BOBBY G coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
offered up a mild bid. WILD BANKER coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, angled in to the rail near the eighth pole offering up a bid, then flattened out in the late stages. DONTBELATE four then three wide
through the first turn, prompted the leader from the outside in the two path, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was set down spinning just off the
inside into upper stretch knocking heads on near even terms with the leader, took narrow advantage a furlong from home, got displaced when overwhelmed
with a sixteenth to run and weakened in the late going. LORD GATLING forwardly placed three then two wide into the first turn, took over command and
showed the way in hand along the inside under prompting from the aforementioned foe to the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and knocked
heads through the latter portion of the turn and took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front near the eighth pole and weakened in the final
furlong. STYNER stumbled badly at the start getting away last, raced five then four wide through the first turn, chased three wide advancing on the top pair
midway down the backstretch, was in range of that pair of rivals when placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch in
retreat and weakened in the drive. PER RULING FROM HIWU, HANG TIGHT WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
NIKITIS established a forward position early, climbed into the kickback outside the five-eighths then moved out, reached the outside of the field late on the
backstretch, was roused four then three wide on the turn, pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole
and got up under strong handling to prevail. CURLIN'S GIRL showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of foes, vied in the two path on the turn,
came in while still on her left lead at the three-sixteenths then lost action while brushing the rail, steadied some and swapped to the proper lead in the
process, was put to the crop at the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. WHOCOULDASKFORMO a bit slow
into stride then urged along off the pace, was carried out near the five-eighths pole, went five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of
the rest. WYNNING TOUCH moved up between horses to press the pace inside the three-quarter pole, chased the leaders passing the nine-sixteenths,
raced in hand while just off heels near the seven-sixteenths, went around most of the turn in the two path, dropped to the inside near the five-sixteenths then
checked sharply off heels and also lacked the needed response. KATHYNMARISSA hit the outside of the gate then was awkwardly into stride, spotted the
front a few lengths, settled under some urging, moved closer late on the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn and failed to rally. VERY
PRACTICAL was off slow and spotted the front many lengths then angled in, moved up under urging with five furlongs to run, advanced much closer to the
leaders late on the backstretch, took an awkward stride and checked off heels near the seven-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, checked sharply behind
another checking foe late on that bend, came out into upper stretch and had nothing left in a tough debut. EXTRA DIRTY disputed the pace on the outside,
vied in the three path for most of the turn, dropped back while moving to the two path near the five-sixteenths and capitulated.

Footnotes
BLU GROTTO brushed the outside of the gate then had the rider lose his left iron briefly and dropped back, spotted the front a few lengths, had the rider
reach down to regain footing in the left iron before going a sixteenth of a mile, was coaxed along on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, gained
six wide into the stretch, took the lead inside the three-sixteenths and drew away while remaining on his inside lead to the finish. AMANI'S EAGLE went to
the front, showed the way while in hand, went around the turn in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper
stretch and proved no match for the winner while able to get the place. GRANDPA'S KID brushed with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, was roused
while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved out outside the furlong marker and just got up for the
show. UNION LIGHTS settled off the pace, was asked three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and just missed the show. PRINCE OF JOY
raced just off the pace on the outside, chased four to five wide on the turn and tired. NORGAY broke out and brushed with a foe, tracked the pace on the
inside of a rival, chased along the rail on the turn and came up empty. REGALITY stalked the pace down the backstretch, chased four then three wide on
the turn and capitulated. M B'S MUNNING had his head turned at the start then lunged and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, settled on the
outside, was roused five then six wide on the turn, spun seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. CHEEKY TICO was rated just off the pace, saved
ground while asked on the turn and also came up empty. SALUTE TO AMERICA raced just off the pace between horses, chased three then two wide on the
turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and had nothing left.

Footnotes
HOT FUDGE showed the way in hand just off the inside, got set down at the quarter pole, edged clear under a drive to prevail. EVIDENCIAS (BRZ) struck

backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, ran on clear for the
place honors to be along second best. SWEET WILLEMINA chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,

Footnotes
FLIGHT CONTROL showed good speed on the outside, moved clear late on the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, spun off
the rail into the stretch, drew off under a drive into the final furlong and proved much the best under strong urging. FIVE TO TWO chased the pace on the
outside then four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, remained on her inside lead to the finish and narrowly earned the place while no
match for the winner. PRINCESS VINO broke a bit slow then dropped back while taken up with the right-rein, moved out then was urged along on the
outside, shifted from three to five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and just missed the place while clear for the show. SPEIGHTS DANCE
broke out and bumped with a rival, swerved out near the five-eighths pole, was urged off the pace, went five wide on the turn and came up empty. HANDLE
ON YOU was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, remained on her inside lead to the furlong
marker then swapped to the proper lead and failed to threaten. ZHEN LOU showed good speed on the inside of the winner, dropped back a bit late on the
backstretch, bobbled outside the seven-sixteenths, chased inside to the two path on the turn and tired. H M S VICTORY was bumped at the start, chased
the pace on the inside of an opponent, went three wide on the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and capitulated. TROUBLED LUCK was hustled
from the gate, dropped to the rear, went around the turn in the two path, came out into upper stretch and showed little. SNARKY moved out under urging
early and was pulled up late on the backstretch then vanned off.
