Footnotes
KITTEN'S ROMANCE broke outwards on the start, stalked three wide outside down the back straight, started to rally going three wide around horses at the
three eighths marker, loomed four wide at the top of the lane, seized command at the furlong pole and edged clear for the win in deep stretch. SIMPLE
SOUVENIR tracked inside behind the front duo down the backstretch, kept pace on the rail throughout the turn, angled out for a clear path four wide at the
furlong pole and determinedly chased the winner, getting closer at the wire. VALLEY GIRL assumed the lead outside in the beginning, was relegated to
hound the pacesetter outside at the half, re-gained the lead between rivals at the quarter pole, could not hold off the winner outside at the furlong marker
and faded late to be a clear third at the finish line. WICKED MIAH was brushed inside at the start, tracked the front two outside down the backstretch, was
asked for more between horses midway on the turn, could not quicken with others starting a run and finished up willingly to the wire for a minor share in the
end. FEDALIA had a stalking role on the inside in the third flight early on, was on hold behind runners in a tightly packed bunch around the bend, could not
offer a finish to get involved through the lane and passed the weary early leader down the stretch. SILENT GUROO pressed the pace on the fence down the
back straight, briefly took command at the half mild marker, was collared outside by runners at the quarter pole, offered little resistance and wilted on the rail
in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
MIDWAY MISCHIEF tucked in settling off the pace inside saving ground toward the rear, was ridden along coming to the quarter pole, angled five to six
wide at the top of the stretch and under strong urging, surged late to get up in time over CANDY STREET, who was forwardly-placed stalking from outside
two to three deep early, advanced to the lead nearing the quarter pole, moved clear in the stretch, was outfinished. PREETZAH'S STAR got away well,
ceded the lead settling in behind content to track on or just off the lead, came out three to four wide at the top of the stretch in range, ran on evenly and just
held show. GOOD SOLDIER settled at the back, switched out off the inside up the backstretch, fanned seven wide outside foes turning for home, gained
mildly late but missed show honors. ROBITAILLE was urged clear from the start, shifted in to the two path dictating the pace, continued to lead on or just off
the rail before being overtaken about the quarter pole, weakened in the stretch. RIVER OF BABYLON exchanged a light bump at the start, settled
mid-division inside a foe but off the rail, was mostly in the two to four path, failed to menace. PERFECT PLAY exchanged a bump at the start, raced outside
three to four wide, failed to menace. GROOM LAKE was caught wide going four to five deep in the early stages, failed to rally.

HOME FOR A REST was away alertly leading in the beginning, was then content to hound the pacesetter outside at the half, re-bid for the lead between
foes at the top of the stretch and kept the outside challenger at bay in the last sixteenth under a hand ride. ROSIEPOSIE tracked on the rail down the
backstretch, started to rally angling out three wide with a quarter of a mile to go, loomed boldly in the three path straightening out for home by could not get
by the stubborn winner through the stretch. AMI'S GIRL improved down the backstretch after the start to prompt the pace inside at the five furlong marker,
briefly took command at the quarter pole inside, was headed outside by runners in upper stretch, could not match strides with the top two at the sixteenth
pole and faded to be a clear third at the finish line. POETIC AMY stalked in the third flight between horses in the early stages, improved smartly on the rail
throughout the turn and finished with intent to the wire to settle on the fringes in the end. CITRINA tracked the front pair outside down the backstretch, was
roused trying to keep up with the leaders at the quarter pole, could not find more to go with rivals up front and was one paced in the stretch drive.
HELECONIA travelled on the rail having one rival beaten down the backside, was asked for more but made little impression around the bend and could not
be a presence in the stretch running. BIRCH BARK stalked in the third flight outside down the backstretch, offered a brief run three wide at the three furlong
marker but came up empty at the top of the stretch. HYPERYA veered out on the break to trail down the backside, was urged right handed in midturn,
offered little response and had nothing to show in the drive to the finish line.

Footnotes
FLOWERS 'N BERRIES settled tracking in behind, bid inside in mid-stretch, kicked clear. SPEEDY BUBBLES bumped with a foe at the start, quickly moved
clear, set the pace from just off the rail, drifted out a bit leaving the turn, was overtaken by an inside foe in mid-stretch, proved no match for that one but kept
on to hold the place. SILVER BULLET LADY was well-positioned stalking three to four wide, needed more. BRIDGE TO NOWHERE unhurriedly raced well
back early, saved ground inside on the turn, came out five wide in mid- to late-stretch while gaining well but too late. HOT OMELET bumped with the outside
rival then bumped the inside foe at the start, settled off the pace, advanced outside four to five wide on the turn, evened out. GOLD FORESTER stalked
going three wide on the turn, floated out a bit turning for home, failed to menace. SMILES FOR DAVID dropped back from off the inside, failed to rally.
KRYPTO GAINS was bumped lightly at the start, settled off the leaders inside foes but off the rail in the two to three path, moved out for the drive, failed to
menace.

Footnotes
PATROLMAN was patiently handled sitting in midfield amongst horses down the backstretch, began to edge closer on the rail in the final turn, was set down
on the rail in upper stretch and exploded on by at the sixteenth pole with an impressive turn of foot for the victory. WAR IN CHARGE took control clearing
away on the first turn, had a narrow advantage with rivals closing in at the three eighths marker, opened up sharply at the top of the stretch but was no
match for the winner who closed in strongly in the final furlong. ALL FOR HONOR brushed the inside part of the gate at the start to trail in the first turn, could
still see the field unhurried down the back straight, rallied up the fence at the quarter pole saving ground and finished up smartly inside to win the duel for
third money. ROCK BULLET stalked near the rear in the first turn, rated kindly on the rail galloping along down the backside, was nudged on for more with
five sixteenths left to run , angled out to the four path in the final furlong and just missed in the battle for show. HEY LUIGI was content to track the loose
pacesetter on the first turn, continued to keep a close eye chasing the leader down the backside, bid for the lead two wide between horses at the three
furlong marker, chased the frontrunner to no avail in upper stretch and faded in the last sixteenth. JACK had a stalking position three deep near the rear
down the backside, made little impact throughout the final turn, swung out widest in the six path for the drive and passed weary foes down the lane. SO
CALLED VACATION travelled inside watching the front duo on the first turn, was shuffled back between runners at the half, could not keep pace with rivals
on either side midway on the far turn and lacked a rally in the stretch. MODEL S stalked four deep down the backstretch, made an early move going around
horses four wide at the seven sixteenths pole, had not left to give at the top of the lane and gave way in the five path through the stretch. LIAM'S
AWESOME had a good spot tracking the top pair outside in the beginning, took closer order through the backstretch, prompted three wide at the three
furlong marker, could not sustain the run at the top of the stretch and yielded by the furlong marker.

Footnotes
BRAQUET stalked from outside, advanced three then four wide on the turn, bid past the eighth pole taking a narrow lead, dueled to the wire and got the
nod. SAUCY NAME exchanged minor contact at the start, was forwardly-placed very early then taken back and eased off the leading pair, stalked those into
the turn, moved three wide into upper stretch in striking distance, bid between near the sixteenth pole, missed. MOMUNNYFOR RO bumped the outside
rival lightly at the start, settled mid-pack, came out from three to five wide on the turn, was six wide into upper stretch, gained steadily but too late.
MAXIMUM FIFTY was lightly bumped at the start, forced the pace from outside, moved in from three to two wide into the turn and spurted clear coming past
the five-sixteenths, was challenged in mid-stretch and yielded soon after. GO GIFFEN settled off the pace, moved out from four to eight wide on the turn,
came out a further path or two in upper stretch, was flying in the end but too late. ARCTIC BLONDE hit the gate, settled in the back half of the field, was
outside foes into the turn, continued to move out on that bend and into upper stretch, gained mildly but needed more. FEDOROVA settled off the pace,
saved ground inside, came out three wide at the top of the stretch, ran on. SCAT HUMOR got away slowly, was outpaced early, saved ground through the
turn, steadied in behind foes and altered course seven wide coming to the furlong grounds, kicked on mildly late. FRAC AMOUR chased from inside up
close off the leaders, moved out four wide turning for home, lacked the needed late kick. OUR STELLA dropped back outside lacking speed, was forced out
nine wide turning for home, failed to rally. KID GIZMO exchanged a light bump at the start, contested the pace from inside, gave way. SILENT PRINCESS
chased going two wide through the turn, dropped back, tired.

Footnotes
BEDAZZLE ME travelled on the rail in the third flight, crept closer to the leaders through the turn, angled out gaining momentum four wide to pose the main
threat at the top of the stretch and determinedly wore down rivals in the late stages to get up for the win. SILENT SKY had a good position tucked in on the
rail behind the pacesetter down the backside, continued on the fence waiting to pounce on the turn, closed in to take the lead inside at the furlong marker
but could not hold off the winner in deep stretch. GREAT KATE stalked outside near the rear in the early stages, started a rally four wide circling horses at
the quarter pole, was full of run in the stretch and surged in deep stretch to just capture the show placing in the final few strides. SEATTLE CAUSEWAY was
bumped by inside rival at the start, took control leading down the backside, set the fractions comfortably on the lead throughout the turn, was headed on
either side at the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly, just getting caught late for third money. APRIL DE VELP chased the frontrunner down the
backstretch, continued to follow the leader through the turn, was in the hunt three wide straightening out for the drive, could not find another gear in the lane
and tired in the final furlong. WHERE'S SAMNBAILEY was situated between horses in the third flight stalking at the half, could not close the gap on foes
running around the bend and ran evenly on the inside through the stretch. SARAH'S DANCER travelled in the third flight on the outside, was asked for more
midway on the turn, could not quicken with others and had little to give in the drive to the wire. MORAL TURPITUDE veered out on the break, had to be
taken hold off and trailed down the backside, caught up to the field outside by the quarter pole but could not get interested any further down the lane to be
involved at the finish line. SOUPER COP settled near the back, having one rival beaten down the backside, was hard ridden on the fence making no
progress on the turn and lacked a finishing kick down the stretch.

Footnotes
JAYHAWK settled into stride early switching out further off the inside, went three to four wide racing outside foes early, ridden along past the three-eighths
continuing three to four deep, had a long drive but surged late to take command nearing the seventy yards marker and kick clear. PRINCESS MAYFAIR
broke out a bit and was coaxed to the lead and clear shifting in to set the pace nearer inside, was hounded into and on the far turn but kicked away from that
rival leaving that bend, was clear in upper stretch but outfinished while second best. SMART ALMASTY was forced out a bit at the start, settled at the back
outside a rival shifting in two to three deep, gained inside in the stretch to get up for show. PONTIAC was forced out a bit at the start, tucked in saving
ground near the rail racing at the back, moved out four wide for the drive, ran on evenly. COMPETITIVE TOUCH switched out stalking the runner-up, took
closer order at the half pressing that one just a neck back till late on the far turn, flattened out. PRIMA was caught three wide through the turns, asked for
more outside the quarter, had no late response.

Footnotes
VERI GIZMO was under a snug hold behind the pacesetter down the backside, waited to move on the fence through the turn, angled outside for clear run at
the furlong marker and got up late over a stubborn frontrunning leader in the last few jumps. HOT CARGO took control from the start, dictated the pace
unopposed throughout the turn, had something left in reserve down the stretch and just missed holding off the winner in deep stretch.
PRINCESSOFTHENORTH stalked near the rear on the rail, followed the eventual winner saving ground advancing on the fence around the turn and rallied
smartly up the inside through the stretch to be a non threatening third in the end. ROYAL BLUSH trailed the field in the beginning, caught up the field
making a bold move four wide around horses at the five sixteenths pole, was in range in the five path driving to the wire and ran on mildly in the stretch for a
minor role. LIVIN ON LUV prompted the pace outside on the turn, was in the hunt three wide at the top of the stretch but could not find more down the lane
and levelled off in the last eighth. KNOW HOW (GB) stalked near the rear three wide in the early going, was in range in the three path behind the leaders
straightening out for home and ran on mildly to the finish line. HOLIDAY WITH AMY travelled in mid-pack four deep outside horses down the backside,
made little advance four wide outside rivals around the bend, swung out widest in the six path at the top of the lane but could not be a factor in the stretch
drive. ANAM CARA tracked three wide down the backstretch, kept pace on the turn between horses, shifted out four wide turning for home but could not
contend through the stretch.

Footnotes
HAPPY VALENTINE was allowed to settle at the rear shifting in, advanced three wide leaving the turn, angled in once at the top of the stretch, bid inside
past the furlong marker and kicked away. JILL broke outwardly bumping a rival lightly at the start, stalked from inside a foe but off the fence in the second
flight, moved out three wide coming to the quarter pole gaining in conjunction with the outside rival, was five wide in the drive making a bid in mid-stretch,
was outkicked for the top prize but fought on for the place. SOUPER FLASHY stalked from outside in the second flight, fanned out leaving the turn four then
five wide by the top of the stretch, bid in mid-stretch six wide and outside runners, was outkicked. FRANKIE'S GIRL exchanged light contact at the start,
settled at the back, moved out from two to three wide late on the turn beginning to advance, angled nearer the rail in mid-stretch and finished strongly inside.
SOUPER PECAN was forwardly-positioned stalking from outside a foe just ahead of mid-pack, moved out a bid midway on the turn coming past the
five-sixteenths four wide, fanned seven to eight deep for the drive, kept on late. IMA BEAST broke alertly, soon ceded the lead content to press from outside
going two to three wide, put away the inside foe moving clear in upper stretch but was soon overtaken, faltered and faded. HAI BOBBI tossed the head at
the start, chased from inside, moved out to the three path coming to the quarter pole, ran on evenly. GLORIANNIA settled at the back racing off the rail,
angled ten wide in upper- to mid-stretch, finished quite strongly but far too late. MI CORAZON was about mid-pack racing mostly four to five wide, went
evenly and made no bid. CINNAMON BITS was off the pace outside a rival two to three wide through the turn, came out further for the stretch run, failed to
rally. CARA CARA moved forward inside to soon take the lead, set a pressured pace, came up empty. VERDEJO was ridden along early on the turn saving
ground inside, failed to menace. HARD TO CAPTURE broke a step slowly, was outside at the back four to six wide through the turn, failed to threaten.
COLLECT DATTT was at the back inside a foe but in the three to four path through the turn, failed to menace.
