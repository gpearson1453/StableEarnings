Footnotes
LAWYER JOHN showed good early foot from the inside to set the early pace, raced clear through the far turn and widened through the drive under steady
pressure. PENTATONIC prompt the early leader from the outside, raced three wide in the drive and was no match for the winner. OUR ETHAN CHARLES
raced off the early pace, was three wide around the far turn, raced three to two wide in the lane and moved up to improve position. PRETORIAN GOLD
chased the top pair two deep early and weakened a bit through the drive. SHELTRFROMTHESTORM chased the early pace, raced near the inside past the
quarter pole, eased out into the upper stretch and raced even with no closing run. THAT'S JUST GREAT void of early speed, raced five wide into the upper
stretch and had no response.

going, was three to four wide around the far turn and moved up to improve position through the stretch run. ROAD TO DREAMS coaxed two deep early,
raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and weakened late. VANISHING FAITH dropped back to race mid pack early, was three wide around the far
turn and lacked a rally. SONG SAVER raced off the early going, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and lacked a final bid.

Footnotes
JUMPING RAINBOWS settled off the early pace, moved up near the rail in the stretch, finished well to just get up under strong handling.
BROKENHEARTED broke in, bumped at the start, tracked the top pair down the backstretch, took aim near the three sixteenths pole from the outside and
just missed in a game effort. BAZINGA D dueled from the inside down the backstretch, drifted a bit through the stretch run race well off the inside and kept
on gamely to the wire. GOTTA HAVE HEART dueled from the outside of rival, was in tight between near the sixteenth pole and finished willingly to the wire.
Jockey of Gotta Have Heart claimed objection against Brokenhearted for interference in the stretch run and stewards ruled no change. FAST STUDY raced
off the early going, was three deep and had no late response. UNCLE GEORGY was jostled at the break, raced five wide around the far turn, raced from the
outside in the lane, altered out near the sixteenth pol and had not enough. SHARP STYLE was bumped at the start and lacked a response.

AUGIE'S GIRL pressed the early leader two deep from the outside, dug in through the stretch from the inside and held the place position. DUSTED raced
off the early pace, made a four to five wide bid in the stretch run and moved up to improve position. JOYFUL DEPARTURE forwardly placed from the inside,
checked slightly near the three eighths pole and weakened through the drive. CLASSICALCROSSOVER coaxed along from the outside, raced five wide into
the upper stretch and lacked a rally. WITHOUT A NET vied for the early lead from the inside and gave way. TRAJEC HOLIDAY was allowed to settle early
and failed to respond. TEMPTRESS CALLING raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. DENIM N LACE dropped back early,

Footnotes
KELLY'S PARTY GIRL rated along early, raced near the inside around the far turn, shifted out five wide and finished well to prove best under strong
handling. UPTOWN KID was sent to a clear lead from the outside and gave way grudgingly to the wire. GEMINI WARRIOR was off a step slow, rushed up
from the inside and kept on gamel to the wire. PRIDEFUL VILLANO void of early speed, raced two to three wide and moved up to improve position.
SECRET SPELL was off slowly, raced near the inside around the far turn and was even late with no closing run. FIRE EYE raced mid pack early, was six
wide into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. CHIMING IN raced three to four wide around the far turn and had no response. DIXIE MUSIC raced five deep
near the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. WIN FOR LAILA was coaxed along two deep and faded.
