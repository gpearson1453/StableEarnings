Footnotes
SOHANA vied for the lead on the inside, shook clear on the turn, then dug in gamely to win the head bob late to prove best under a drive. MEL'S BABY
SISTER was bumped at the start, then was keen three wide, dropped to the inside and steadied by the three eighths, tipped out two wide for aim to make
bid on the front runner, made that bid on her left lead between rivals in the furlong grounds and just missed losing the head bob. PRINCESS VINO prompted
the pace and made a three wide bid off the turn but was outfinished while saving the show award. CITY BLOCKS bobbled at the start, then bumped a rival
while recovering, settled on the inside and eased off the inside on the turn to be three wide nearing the quarter pole, swung out five wide leaving the turn
and rallied well. TROUBLED LUCK stalked the early pace on the outside and was four wide on the turn but faded in the drive. LUCKY AND GORGEOUS
was reserved on the inside and failed to menace. ZHEN LOU vied for the early lead in between rivals and faltered. CAROL T was reserved early two wide
and never threatened.

nearing the quarter pole and drew off leaving the turn in the two path, then drifted out slightly through the furlong grounds and was given one pop right
handed with the crop to remain well clear to prove best. BOY IS SHE A LADY chased the pace two wide, shifted out and was five wide by the quarter pole
and finished well to be clearly second best while no match to the winner. EMBRACEABLE GAL tracked the early pace on the outside, four wide on the turn
but faded while staying on to best the rest. SHOOPTHEREITIS was well placed on the inside,swung out six wide leaving the turn but was empty. JOEY THE

Footnotes
LAMBETH was settled early, made a five to four wide move on the far turn to loom boldly, then had a long drive with MCQUEEN and prevailed late to prove
best. MCQUEEN set a pressured pace on the inside, then drifted out through the lane while digging in gamely and just missed. CAPITAL IDEA was rated
well early, then was between rivals and waited for racing room nearing the quarter pole, then found room leaving the three sixteenths and finished well on
the inside. TIMING DIFFERENCE was reserved early, four wide on the turn, shifted out and had a belated rally on the outside. UNIQUE INSIGHT pressed
the pace three wide, then was in tight between rivals in upper stretch, angled out and faded. UNION BULLDOG was well placed on the inside, cut the corner
off the turn but came up empty. CAROLO RAPIDO stalked the early pace on the outside, four to three wide on the turn and weakened. KING
MENDELSSOHN was settled early and then tired.

Footnotes
AMERICAN MONARCH three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, had the runner up tip out and
briefly had the crop of that rival flashed in front of him, rallied to take command a sixteenth out, dug in gamely to prevail. ANDIAMO A FIRENZE hustled from
the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths while under developing threat from a trio to
the outside, swung four wide into upper stretch, got directed out a path to look his main danger in the eye near the eighth pole, flashed the crop briefly in
front of his rival before being collared a sixteenth out, fought on to the finish to just preserve the place honors on the wire. EMERALD FOREST chased
along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
LISTENTOYOURHEART chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but
was outfinished. WAKE SURF coaxed from the gate, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, kept
on one paced to the finish. TRAFALGAR chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered
up a bid but was outkicked.

Footnotes
KHAFRE pressed the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid nearing the quarter pole to vie for command, then kicked clear leaving the turn and drew
off to prove much the best under crop urging. SKI PATROL was settled early, three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and finished willingly to
gain the place award. CHEEKY TICO tracked the early pace and was between rivals on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn and had a mild late
rally to best the rest. AMANI'S EAGLE stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid to vie for command by the quarter pole but weakened in the
lane. NORGAY was reserved early two wide, eased out on the turn and came six wide into the lane and had no rally. SALUTE TO AMERICA tracked the
pace on the in side and weakened. STRONG LIGHT was outrun early, motivated by the three eighths marker on the inside and passed the tiring rivals late.
HOMETOWN HERO was off slowly, settled in the back and raced wide on the turn and came widest into the stretch and was no threat. WYNN GIANT
chased the early pace on the outside, five wide on the turn and came seven wide into the lane and was empty. MINEOLA MIKE set a pressured pace on the
inside and gave way.

Footnotes
CRUPI just off the inside soon after the start, got forced to check off the heels of KING KUMBALAY as that rival crossed directly in front into the first turn,
raced two then three wide through the opening bend before taking back briefly to the two path, chased three wide down the backstretch before going three
to four wide through far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the
final furlong and was between foes nearing the finish and was up in the last jumps over a trio on the wire. QUALITY CHIC three wide through the first turn,
chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, rallied to get on near even terms for command at
the three-sixteenths, dug in between foes through the final furlong on his wrong lead late and missed at the end. KINETIC SKY forwardly placed three wide
through the first turn, attended the leader from the outside two to three wide, advanced on that rival to take command at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat clinging to the front until collared inside the final forty yards and ran on to preserve the show honors on the line.
SIGNATOR three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and
kicked on belatedly latching on the top trio inside the final sixteenth while clear of the rest. KING KUMBALAY tucked to the two path with eight and a half
furlongs to run and forced CRUPI to check off his heels and CONSTITUTIONLAWYER to steady along the rail, chased just off the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, weakened in the late stages, then was reported to have bled. CONSTITUTIONLAWYER got
steadied along the rail with eight and a half furlongs to go when KING KUMBALAY tucked inwards placing CRUPI in tight to his outside, chased along the
inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. LOST ARK hustled from the gate,
showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, yielded the front with five-sixteenths remaining, cut the corner
into upper stretch and weakened. FOREWARNED coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, tipped out four
to five wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
PROUD FOOT chased the early pace from the outside, made a five wide move on the turn and kicked clear nearing the furlong marker and then remained
clear to the wire to prove best under a drive. GOLDEN ROCKET prompted the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command, then
led briefly but was out-kicked by the winner while saving the place award. SWEETEST PRINCESS tracked the early pace four wide, then moved in to be
three wide on the turn, angled out seven wide leaving the turn and rallied well to just miss the place award. TO A T was allowed to settle early, three to four
wide on the turn, came six wide off the turn and had a late rally to gain the last spot in the superfecta. SWEET MYSTERY was settled early two wide, then
was two to three wide on the turn and swung out five wide leaving the turn to offer a belated rally. LISA'S VISION stalked the early pace three wide, made a
four wide bid on the turn to vie for command but flattened out the final furlong. DAME CINCO set the pace on the inside and then dueled for command on
the turn but weakened. VIENNA CODE was bumped at the start, settled back early and lacked a rally. VALLELUJAH chased the early pace briefly four wide
and dropped back. ICHIBAN chased the early pace on the inside and tired, eased the final furlong and walked off. THE RIDER ON NUMBER NINE
SWEETEST PRINCESS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE AROUND THE HALF MILE MARKER, AFTER THE
STEWARDS REVIEWED THE REPLAYS, THE RACE WAS LEFT AS IS AND THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED.
