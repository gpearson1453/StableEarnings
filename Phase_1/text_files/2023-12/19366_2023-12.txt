Footnotes
SHERILINDA broke alertly, conceded the early lead and prompted the modest pace, advanced into the far turn and pressed LYINATTHEBAR to the quarter
marker, battled with that rival into the stretch, took command into the final sixteenth and edged away late to prove best. LYINATTHEBAR assumed
command away from the start, set a modest pace while prompted through the backstretch run, was pressed into the far turn by SHERILINDA, battled with
that rival into the stretch, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and was clear in the end for second. SPLICER tracked the modest pace from the inside,
gained ground into the far turn, lacked a final response in the stretch and held well for third. LUCY L bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, settled
outside of runners into the first turn and tracked the modest pace three wide into the backstretch run, was coaxed along two wide into the far turn, raced in
traffic and waited for racing room nearing the top of the lane, angled three wide for the drive, could not muster the needed late response and was outfinished
for third. ALESHA allowed to settle, saved all of the ground to the far turn, mounted an inside bid in the stretch, could not sustain that run in the late stages
and flattened out. ST HELENA tracked the modest pace three wide, was asked for run nearing the quarter marker, lacked a response into the stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
COOPERKLIMT crowded at the start by a neighboring rival and was away a bit slowly, tracked the modest pace from the inside, saved all of the ground to
the far turn, tipped two wide into the stretch, made a mild gain at the furlong marker, responded into the final sixteenth, closed determinedly and overtook
the runner-up in deep stretch to prevail. EFFECTIVE GIG sent away from the start and assumed command in the early going, set modest fractions while
well rated through the backstretch run and showed the way to the quarter pole, raced in hand into the lane and extended the lead at mid-stretch, felt
pressure from COOPERKLIMT in the final sixteenth, could not hold off the winner and was outfinished, while clear of the rest for second. MY DAD IS
THIRSTY crowded COOPERKLIMT leaving the break but was away in good order, took back off of the early pace and stalked into the first turn, stalked the
modest pace through the backstretch run, mounted a two wide bid at the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch, was outkicked in the final sixteenth
and was clear in the end for third. SHERM allowed to settle while never far back, mounted a two wide bid into the far turn, could not sustain that run into the
stretch and flattened out. UNUSUAL CODE tracked the early pace two wide and between runners, improved position into the backstretch run and continued
his advance three wide heading to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and weakened. FANTASTIC DREAM allowed to settle and raced
three wide into the first turn, maintained an outside path through the backstretch run and improved position at the half-mile marker, raced four wide to the
quarter pole, dropped back into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

early pace and tracked from the second flight, maintained an outside path into the turn and raced three then four wide to the quarter marker, rallied at
mid-stretch, needed more in the final sixteenth and was clear in the end for third. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN allowed to settle away from the start, tracked two
wide into the turn then chased the quick pace to the quarter marker, slipped to the inside into upper stretch and advanced at the furlong marker, needed
more in the final sixteenth and offered a mild late rally. ALL prominent early, tracked the fast pace while close up into the turn, slipped to the rail nearing the
quarter marker and vied for the lead into the stretch, could not keep pace with SHEMAKESCENTS inside of the furlong marker and weakened in the final
stages. NOMI LACKEE bobbled then hit the gate leaving the start and was away a bit slowly, lacked early speed and saved ground while trailing into the
turn, chased into the stretch and did not factor. SHELBY GOLD chased the fast early pace while between runners, raced two wide into the turn, chased
three wide into the stretch, lost position at the furlong marker and did not threaten. TEASPOON OF PEPPER showed speed away from the start and

Footnotes
TIGER IN MY TANK broke well and took the early lead with GOOD LOVIN in close pursuit, held all at bay through the turn, was challenged by that foe at the
five-sixteenths pole, responded then battled on as the two pulled away from the rest, got a nose in front and held. GOOD LOVIN broke well and stalked
TIGER IN MY TANK to the turn under a tight old, went to challenge at the five-sixteenths pole then was set down and engaged in a spirited duel to the wire
but came up a nose short while drifting in late. CLEVER CLOVER broke out and bumped UNION COACH after the break then got shuffled back, angled to
the rail and settled at the rear of the field in the early stages, waited for room through the turn while keeping the rail, got an opening as the field turned for
home, put in a good late run, was gaining on the leaders then ran out of race track. TOUGHERTHANTHEREST broke well and was always close up along
the rail, ran on well but was outfinished. DADS DREAM broke best but was quickly overtaken, pulled back from a tight spot near the seven-sixteenths
marker, raced three wide between horse through the turn, was behind a wall of horses turning for home, then had could not find another gear when needed
in the later stages. UNION COACH raced in the middle of the tight pack early, became boxed in through the turn, could not find racing room until the eighth
pole then could not improve when clear. AUTISM PUZZLE broke out at the start, then was a bit slow to get going, rushed up into contention before the turn,
advanced four wide through the turn while staying clear of any trouble, came under pressure at the top of the stretch, had some trouble changing leads and
was outfinished in the late stages.

Footnotes
WILD JEWELS broke out a step at the start and bumped SUSHI STICKS, was forwardly placed while a bit keen in the early stages, tracked the modest
pace through the backstretch run, was asked for run into the far turn and confronted IMMELMANN approaching the quarter marker, gained command into
upper stretch and was confronted by CLASSY CITY at the three-sixteenths marker, battled with that foe to mid-stretch and lost the lead at the furlong
marker, came again and battled with CLASSY CITY into the final sixteenth, was carried out in deep stretch when CLASSY CITY drifted, took a narrow
advantage in the final strides and held at the finish to determinedly prevail. CLASSY CITY settled in the second flight to begin, tracked the early pace from a
two wide path along the first turn, tracked the modest pace while well positioned through the backstretch run, gained ground two wide into the far turn,
slipped to the inside and loomed in upper stretch, took command and held a narrow lead at the furlong marker, dueled with WILD JEWELS to the
sixteenth-marker, drifted out under firm left handed urging in deep stretch, carried out WILD JEWELS while dueling into the final strides and was bested at
the finish, while holding for second. SUSHI STICKS bumped at the start by a neighboring rival and was off a step slowly, settled off of the early pace and
raced two wide into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run and made a mild gain at the half-mile marker, continued to
advance two wide along the far turn, angled four wide in upper stretch, was gaining inside of the furlong pole, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch
and was well clear for third. DRUM BUNNY away slowly and spotted the field to begin, was allowed to settle and was guided to the three path into the first
turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, was coaxed along two wide into the second turn, was not able to impact the top three in the stretch drive
and passed tiring rivals late. IT AINT OVER tracked the early pace from the inside, gained ground into the backstretch run and was well positioned heading
to the half-mile marker, took up leaving the three-furlong pole and lost position approaching the quarter marker, chased into the stretch and did not offer a
late rally. IMMELMANN asked for speed away from the start and assumed command in the early going, set a moderate pace into the backstretch run and
controlled the pace through modest fractions to the half-mile pole, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken into the stretch, could
not keep pace at the furlong grounds and gave way. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING IN DEEP STRETCH. THE STEWARDS
RULED THAT CLASSY CITY DRIFTED OUT INTO THE PATH OF WILD JEWELS IN THE FINAL SIXTEENTH BUT AS WILD JEWELS WAS FIRST PAST
THE FINISH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

quarter pole, took command into the stretch, battled with RAMATHORN while drifting out approaching the furlong marker, shook free into the late stages

final sixteenth but was gaining in deep stretch and held clearly in the end for second. WHAT A RELIEF chased the solid early pace between runners, ran in

outfinished MOOLA MAN for third. MOOLA MAN chased the solid early pace from the outside, gained ground three wide along the turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for third. RAMATHORN broke in a bit at the start and crowded RICH SON OF A BUN, was

pressure at the quarter marker and battled with ROCKET RIBBON into the stretch, could not keep pace with that rival in the final furlong and faded in the
late stages. RICH SON OF A BUN crowded leaving the start and was away slowly, spotted the field in the early stages and trailed into the turn, saved
ground to the quarter marker, was able to improve position in the stretch but did not factor. ROAD HOUSE chased the solid early pace, came in a bit tight
entering the turn and steadied at the three-furlong pole, chased two wide into the stretch and did not threaten. ITS HAPPY HOUR prominent away from the

Footnotes
DE LA LUNA got in a little tight a few strides from the gate, then settled mid-pack through the first turn, stayed out in the clear three to four wide for the
backstretch run always traveling well under a rating hold, pulled the rider to the lead passing the quarter pole, responded when set down in the stretch and
pulled away from the field to an easy win. LIMITED HEATWAVE raced three wide through the early going and was content to track from the middle of the
strung out field to the turn, made a mild forward move while still wide through the far turn, swung out to the five path for the stretch run, kept to task under
steady handling and just got up for second. KEEN HEIR broke well and was up on the early pace going into the turn, then backed out of the developing
speed duel to a tracking position, was content with that position then looked to improve while racing between horses through the far turn, was set down near
the five-sixteenths marker, loomed a threat then had trouble changing leads, could not match the eventual winner but kept to task and was tagged at the
wire for the second spot. ALGERIA (IRE) was unhurried from the break and settled towards the back, chased the field to the stretch and made a mild late
run to improve position in the final furlong. MOVIETIME raced three wide through the clubhouse turn, settled well behind the field down the backstretch
while saving ground along the rail, tried to rally late but did not have a response when needed. RESERVE PROOF was up on the early pace then backed off
nearing the six furlong marker while under some restraint, tracked the leading pair to the far turn while racing near the rail and still under a tight hold, waited
for room through the far turn, tried to tip out through a narrow opening just past the three-sixteenths pole, was thwarted in that attempt and then was
outfinished in the final furlong. WORKDAY was hustled to the front, bumped with HOT JOURNEY near the seven-sixteenths pole, got fanned four wide
through that turn, came into the stretch with a short lead but was spent from earlier efforts and gave way readily. HOT JOURNEY took a bump from
WORKADAY just before the turn, then raced between a quartet contesting the early lead, traded the lead at various points with that same rival for six
furlongs, came under pressure at the top of the stretch and weakened. TALISKER BAY was not asked for speed from the break and settled to the rear of
the field through the early stages, was distanced passing the six furlong marker then tried to rally into contention six wide on the turn but could not improve
position.

Footnotes
HATTIE T rated off of the contentious early pace and tracked from the second flight, chased between runners and gained ground two wide along the turn,
raced in traffic at the quarter marker and angled four then five wide into the stretch, closed determinedly inside of the furlong pole and wore down rivals into
the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. VELOCIOUS broke in a step leaving the start and crowded a neighboring
rival, was asked for early speed and chased the contentious pace while saving ground into the turn, improved position while in pursuit heading to the quarter
marker, found an opening along the rail into upper stretch and loomed approaching the furlong pole, confronted BROADWAY TIGER and battled with that
rival into the final sixteenth, took command into deep stretch, fought gamely into the final strides and was tagged on the wire for the win, while holding for
second. BROADWAY TIGER broke out a step leaving the start and crowded a neighboring rival, recovered and vied for the early lead with YO BABY,
dueled with that runner while carving out solid fractions into the turn, disputed the moderate pace inside of YO BABY approaching the quarter marker, drifted
to the two path into upper stretch and held foes at bay to the furlong marker, battled with VELOCIOUS into the final sixteenth, lost the lead to that rival and
was outfinished by the top pair in deep stretch, while holding for third in a good effort. CREATIVE QUALITY squeezed leaving the start and was off a bit
slowly, recovered and tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, improved position into the turn then came in tight and waited for racing room
nearing the top of the lane, angled four wide into upper stretch, finished well in the final furlong and was gaining in deep stretch. YO BABY hustled away
from the gate and vied for the early lead, engaged with BROADWAY TIGER and dueled through solid fractions heading into the turn, contested the
moderate pace along the bend while outside of BROADWAY TIGER, drifted to the three path into upper stretch and battled to the furlong grounds, could not
hold off oncoming rivals in the final sixteenth and weakened. OOPS (GB) ducked out at the start and was off slowly, chased while trailing into the turn, was
taken off of the rail and improved position six wide at the quarter marker, swung widest into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker and finished
evenly. RYE LANE prominent early and tracked the solid pace outside of runners, lost position into the turn and chased five wide to the quarter marker,
lacked a response in the stretch and gave way. SPARTA F. C. prominent early, raced close up to the contentious pace while three wide, lost position into
the turn and chased four wide to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
WARD 'N JERRY settled mid-pack and well behind the pace to the halfway point, was asked to quicken approaching the three furlong marker, responded
with a forward move through the far turn, tipped out through a fortuitous opening at the top of the stretch, ran on well under intermittent urging and was
along in time. LAW ABIDING took advantage of trouble to the inside to clear the field from the break and seize the lead and the inside track through the
clubhouse turn, went unchallenged on the pace to the stretch, opened up on the field, found another gear, was collared inside the sixteenth pole but held
second in a good effort. CANELITO was hustled but outrun to the bend, tracked well behind the top two in the early stages, moved closer through the far
turn, loomed a threat passing the quarter pole, could not match strides with the top pair but kept to task and gained third. SUGAR BEETS broke in and
bumped with RESPECT THE HUSTLE, had to check briefly then was floated four wide into the first bend, raced three wide near the rear of the field down
the backstretch, made good forward progress while saving some ground through the far turn then finished strong under steady handling. TWIRLING DERBY
got caught four wide into the first turn then was under some pressure to get closer down the backstretch to no avail, remained wide around the far turn,
came into the stretch five wide and produced a mild rally that resulted in some late gain. IL CAPITANO tracked LAW ABIDING from a few lengths back
through the early stages, went to challenge approaching the quarter pole, was unable to keep pace and weakened. HOUSE OF LORDS broke out and into
RESPECT THE HUSTLE after the break, raced in the middle of the strung out field, went four wide around the far turn and into the stretch and finished
evenly. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE broke a step slow then was hustled into traffic, got jostled a bit going into the first turn, then settled near the back,
struggled to keep pace on the far turn, came under a ride from the three furlong pole and finished one-paced to the wire. RESPECT THE HUSTLE got
squeezed a few jumps from the gate, raced near the rear of the field while under restraint, lost ground on the far turn then tried to rally late but was unable to
make an impact.
