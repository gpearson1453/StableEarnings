Footnotes
JO DADDY was on heels having to be throttled down sharply behind the frontrunner who was slowing the pace down into the first turn, recovered to rate
kindly behind the leaders down the backside, started to move forward shifting out three wide with a run at the quarter pole and was gaining with each stride
to wear the the leaders in deep stretch for the win. BUCK'S FIZZ angled in from the outside to track in the two path in the first turn, pressed the pace outside
down the backstretch, bid for the lead inching ahead at the five sixteenths marker, battled in upper stretch with a determined early leader, edged away from
that foe at the sixteenth pole but could not hold off the closing in winner in the final jump before the wire. SPEEDY BULLEIT took command angling in to the
rail for the lead, slowing it down when entering the first turn setting a soft pace, continued up front with mild pressure outside, was collared outside midway
on the far turn, battled stubbornly on the fence for the lead until the sixteenth pole and faded late to hold for third at the wire. THOR'S CAUSE stalked near
the rear on the rail in the beginning, co-trailed on the inside down the backside, asked for more edging closer with five sixteenths to run, was in range just
behind the engaged leaders at the top of the stretch and finished up evenly for a minor role in the end. DUBAWI BULL was steadied going into the first
bend, co-trailed on the outside down the backstretch, offered a mild run midway on the far turn, angled four wide turning for home and could not get involved
driving to the finish line. TRUE SHOT was pinched between foes on the break, then was checked going into the first turn, regrouped to track two wide
outside down the back straight, prompted the pace three wide at the three eighths marker, could not go on with others through the turn losing ground and
was not a factor in the stretch drive. STEWARDS INQUIRY UNDER THE WIRE FOR THE FIRST TIME (15/16THS POLE) RESULTED IN #7 BUCKS FIZZ

Footnotes
PAT'S GAMBLE forced the pace between horses in the early going, shadowed the frontrunner on the outside through the turn and wore down the
pacesetting rival down the lane to edge away for the win in deep stretch. THE NEW MAYBE took control inside with a slim advantage down the backstretch,
set the fractions on the turn while hounded outside by the winner, gamely fought on the fence down the stretch, never really gave in but was outkicked in the
final seven yards to best the rest. JAGGERSGOTAGUN was tucked in on the rail just behind the leaders down the backside, kept pace on the fence through
the turn and ran on mildly to the wire to be a clear third at the finish line. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA stumbled on the break, was allowed to settle into stride on
the rail trailing down the backstretch, started to pick up rivals rallying in mid-stretch inside and closed in to settle on the fringes in the end. GEE QUE stalked
three wide outside having one foe beaten down the backside, offered a brief rally from the three furlong marker to the quarter pole and flattened out in upper
stretch. POLITICAL WARFARE prompted the issue three wide down the back straight, chased the front duo three wide throughout the turn and could not
find more in upper stretch and tired at the furlong marker. CLIVE CROSS stalked between runners near the back of the pack down the backside, made little
progress running around the bend and had nothing to give in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MUSICAL STRIDE was keen under restraint behind the leaders on the backside, settled comfortably on the fence waiting for his cue throughout the turn,
pounced up the fence in upper stretch, found another gear at the furlong pole and was drawing away for the win at the wire. PRINCE OF THIEVES travelled
in mid-pack on the rail in the early going, angled outside to track two wide at the three furlong marker, took closer order around the turn, loomed four wide at
the top of the stretch and battled determinedly to the wire but was just outfinished in the last sixteenth. FOREST STAR pressed the pace outside down the
backstretch, seized command outside at the quarter pole, could not match strides with the top two relinquishing the lead at the furlong marker and ran on to
the wire to be a comfortable third. REMEMBERING RHODA stalked near the rear on the outside, was hard ridden closing the gap on the leaders mildly
around the bend, swung outside in the four path straightening for home and showed some late energy to close in for a minor role in the end.
CHROMEPLATED HEART set the fractions inside down the backstretch, maintained a narrow advantage on the fence in the turn, was collared outside at
the quarter pole, battled in the two path up front in upper stretch and yielded to others in the final eighth. POINT TO THE STARS trailed the field down the
backside, could not get interested through the turn and was not a presence in the stretch running.

Footnotes
LUV TO WIN pressed from outside going three wide, bid at the top of the stretch, dueled, edged clear late. AIM FOR THE SKY quickly moved to the lead
and shifted in, set the pace near but off the fence, was challenged at the top of the stretch, kept on but was outkicked. DETERMINED FURY tracked in
behind between runners early then just off the fence, was guided out five wide in upper stretch, finished well but needed more. SPITE STORE broke just a
half-step slowly, was ridden along outside the quarter pole having gone three to four wide through the turn and off the leaders, fanned out a bit further for the
drive, showed good late effort but was not enough. LENNY K lacked early speed racing toward the back off the inside, improved position. HIGHLAND LIFE
was in a bit tight early as the pacesetter shifted nearer the rail in front, pursued from inside, steadied slightly about the seven-sixteenths, ran on. EMICRACK
(CHI) broke just a tad awkwardly, chased three wide, steadily weakened.

Footnotes
OTTAWA tracked in the second flight three wide outside runners down the backstretch, made a sharp move circling three wide at the three furlong marker,
cruised past the leader at the quarter pole and was going away in the stretch for the dominant victory. ROYAL QUALITY trailed the field at the start,
improved smartly on the fence down the backside, was steadied sharply on the fence at the seven sixteenths pole, re-rallied shifting outside weaving
through runners finding a seam in the four path at the quarter pole and offered a strong finish but could not threaten the winner who was long gone. MOUNT
HOREB was off a step slow to begin, stalked between runners near the rear at the half, was shuffled back some at the quarter pole and was full of run in the
final furlong bursting between horses for a solid third at the wire. ROAD TO VERSAILLES emerged from the pack to have a slim advantage at the five
eighths marker, dictated the pace into the turn, was relegated to the chasing role when the winner cruised past at the quarter pole and faded just nearing the
wire to lose a couple of placings at the finish line. HAPPY QUAD broke outwards on the start, trailing inside down the backstretch, was checked on the rail
with seven sixteenths to go, angled outside midturn starting to commence a rally, swung outside seven wide with momentum turning for home and finished
with intent down the stretch. ALLISTON pressed the pace outside in the beginning, could not keep up to the top two chasing those rivals at the quarter pole,
was in the mix for a small piece of the prize in upper stretch between rivals but gave way in the final seventy yards. WAR EMPIRE was brushed at the start,
recovered to be in the mix up front between horses early on, tracked the front trio on the fence through the turn and weakened on the fence in the last
sixteenth of a mile. ONDINE LADY stalked near the back three deep down the backside, was hard ridden making little headway outside horse around the
bend and retreated in the five path at the furlong marker. TOWN'S WARRIOR tracked in the second flight with runners on each side down the backstretch,
offered a mild run three wide at the quarter pole to be in the hunt in upper stretch for a share but faltered with a sixteenth left to run.

Footnotes
WAGNER stalked the leading pair, was mostly three to four wide, drew even nearing the quarter pole, took the lead by the top of the stretch, edged clear,
just held. AMERICAN DECISION stalked up close going four then five wide on the turn, made a steady bid late but missed. PIERRE broke a step slowly and
was shut off at the start, lacked early speed despite early encouragement racing well back and off the inside, fanned out ten wide turning into upper stretch,
was flying but too late. MAXIMUS MAGIC settled outside off the leaders, was forced four to five wide on the turn, advanced by rivals into upper stretch, kept
on well. GILT EDGE broke a step slowly and was forced out numerous paths at the break, shifted in racing off the pace three wide into the turn, came out in
the stretch, ran on mildly. MONDAY MORNING moved forward under some early urging, contested the pace inside, dropped back late on the turn, switched
out at the sixteenth pole, ran on. BACKONTHECHAINGANG was coaxed to the lead then soon joined by an inside foe, dueled outside that one, was
between foes early on the turn, weakened. FASCINATION STREET veered out bothering rivals at the start, moved forward to pursue the leaders three to
four deep, dropped back while shifting in on the turn racing nearer the rail coming to the top of the stretch, was guided out about seven paths in upper- to
mid-stretch, ran on evenly. BEYOND ADVERSITY raced off the pace and off the inside, swung out eight wide in upper stretch, failed to menace. PANYARD
TAP broke a step slowly, threaded between foes two to three wide up the backstretch to reach striking distance of the leaders into the turn, shifted out four
wide coming to the quarter pole, faltered and faded. KHOPESH broke inwardly a bit and a step slowly, was outpaced. FRAC CITY chased from inside,
steadily retreated through the turn.

Footnotes
ROMEO YANKEE assumed the lead into the first turn, set an honest pace uncontested down the backstretch, spurted away in upper stretch and was kept
to the task to hold safe at the wire for the frontrunning tally. HALL OF DREAMS was tucked in on the rail throughout sitting just behind the winner, shifted
just outside at the top of the stretch, was gaining mildly with every stride but could not reel in the winner in deep stretch. SOUPED UP hounded the pace
outside in the early stages of the race, was in the thick of things in the three path turning for home, could not quicken with the top two in upper stretch and
was one paced late to just hold for third money at the wire. WICKED DJANGO stalked on the rail down the backside, rallied shifting outside going around
foes three wide at the five sixteenths pole, was in range in the four path at the top of the lane and was closing belatedly late just missing the show money at
the line. STOWAWAY broke in at the start, had a good spot outside watching the leaders down the back straight, was encouraged left handed trying to keep
up with the leaders and ran on willingly to the finish line. QUIET SUNDAY was void of speed trailing early, stalked near the rear making little progress
through the turn and could not get into contention down the lane. TAKE CHARGE SOUSI could see the field loping along down the backstretch, failed to
make any impact through the final turn and passed tired runners on the outside down the stretch. STAYHONOR GOODSIDE was brushed at the start,
stalked between horses down the backstretch, made little impression around the final bend and lacked a closing rally down the stretch. RED LINE
OVERDRIVE travelled in the third flight tracking outside down the back straight, made an early move taking closer order three wide at the three furlong pole,
could not sustain the run in upper stretch and retreated. NIKKI NOOTS settled alone in midfield down the backstretch, was roused going in the wrong
direction through the far turn and was empty for the stretch drive.

SECRET RESERVE attended just off the flank of the leader racing up close inside, bid in upper stretch taking a narrow lead, came out in mid-stretch
engaged by an outside foe, was just headed by that one briefly but dug in under urging to retake the lead and held. GRANDSON was reserved at the rear
racing off the rail, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied strongly, drifted in a bit and exchanged light contact late, missed. RON'S GIZMO hopped
slightly at the start, settled outside toward the rear two to three wide early, moved five then six wide late on the far turn picking up steam, bid at the furlong
marker briefly taking a narrow lead just past that point but could not sustain the effort, exchanged light contact late and was outfinished. CRUDEN BAY was
caught outside three to four wide mid-division early, bided time through the far turn, swung out five wide leaving that bend, kept on one-paced in the lane
and needed more. MASON'S GAMBLE raced inside on or just off the rail throughout, waited in behind runners at various points on the far turn, ran on
evenly. DUN DRUM was urged from the break, set the pace two wide, weakened. AVOMAN was forwardly-positioned outside a foe in the second flight
three to four wide early, was within range into the far turn continuing in the same path, faded. PERFECT CRIME stalked from inside a foe off the rail in the
second flight, advanced three wide on the leader to get within striking distance coming to the three-eighths, faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
IRONSTONE brushed the gate on the start, was on hold with horse, saving ground on the fence midturn, was looking for room to rally behind the leaders in
the three path turning for home, darted to the rail finding a seam at the furlong pole and was full of run in deep stretch to edge away for the win.
ARMSTRONG had a good position on the rail watching the front duo down the back straight, was scrubbed on with three eighths remaining inching closer,
loomed in the four path driving to the wire and was tenacious down the lane just giving way to the winner who just had a little more to offer in deep stretch.
LAST AMERICAN EXIT travelled in mid-pack early on, settled outside in hand tracking the engaged leaders at the half, nudged two wide keeping pace with
the front pair at the quarter pole, angled out five wide straightening for home and determinedly fought to the finish holding for show in the end.
FORESTER'S FORTUNE was unhurried trailing outside down the backstretch, rallied three wide outside through the turn, swung out widest in the six path
with run in range of the leaders and battled gamely outside for third money just missing the nod at the finish line. FROSTED OVER tracked the pacesetter
outside in the early going, closed in on the leader to force the issue at the half, bid for the lead two wide at the quarter, seized control in the three path at the
top of the lane, could not find more to hold off the closers at the furlong pole and yielded in the final sixteenth. BORDER TOWN emerged from the quartet to
have a clear lead at the five furlong pole, set the pace while pressed outside in the turn, was collared outside at the quarter pole and have little left to give
between runners in the stretch and faltered at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
LOBBY BAR was nudged early on down the backside for better position, had an ideal trip sitting alone watching the contesting pair through the turn,
pounced three wide in mid-stretch and cleared away in the final sixteenth. MIDWAY MISCHIEF was in no rush trailing down the backside, began to pick up
runners splitting horses in the two path at the quarter pole, was full of run bursting through runners at the furlong pole and ran on to the wire but was second
best on this day. DIAMOND HEIST stalked on the fence near the rear in the beginning, made a sharp move advancing on the rail at the seven sixteenths
marker. was roused midway on the turn inching closer through the turn, rallied late four wide at the furlong pole and closed in to capture third money.
SOVEREIGN CAUSE travelled in midfield between foes down the backside, was urged midway on the turn starting a mild rally, angled out in the five path
straightening out for the drive, never gave up and willingly ran to the wire for a minor role in the end. SOUPER SUNSHINE pressed the issue outside down
the back straight, hounded the frontrunner around the bend, took control to have a brief lead four wide in upper stretch, offered no resistance to the fast
closing winner at the furlong pole and tired losing a few positions in the final seventy yards. MAGNIFICENT MARIO had one rival beaten down the
backstretch, improved on the fence throughout the turn, was in range for a minor placing inside at the top of the stretch but offered no finish in the final
furlong. ADELAIDE COURT tracked three wide on the outside in the beginning, lost positioning outside horses at the half, made no headway running widest
in the four path around the bend, swung out to be seven wide for the stretch run and passed some weary foes late. STAR SCHOLAR stalked near the rear
three wide outside down the backstretch, made no improvement two wide with runners on each side around the turn and finished up evenly down the
stretch. SECRET STORM set the pace while pressed outside down the backstretch, maintained a slim advantage inside through the turn, was collared
outside in upper stretch and folded between runners with a sixteenth left to go. BUTWAITTHERE'SMORE tracked just behind the front duo early on, was
scrubbed on but could not keep pace with leaders at the half mile marker, backed away through the field in mid-turn and was empty for the drive.
