Footnotes
GALLERYGAL came away a bit slow, advanced between rivals into the turn, tacked to the outside near the five-sixteenths pole, came five wide into the
stretch, quickened inside the furlong marker and caught HEAVNENLY DREAM in the final yards. HEAVENLY DREAM sped clear to dictate terms along the
inside, inched away further leaving the turn, fought on doggedly through the lane but was unable to resist the winner. STIRRED UP tracked the pace off of
the inside, loomed a danger entering the stretch three deep, but flattened and settled for the minor award. VINO FRIZZANTE was off a step tardy, tucked in
to save ground, came under a ride into the turn and worked into contention, came five wide and improved position through the drive. GOLD DEL MAR was
forwardly placed three wide, came four wide and was within striking distance to the final furlong and gave in. EVOCATION was hustled along four wide,
finished with a mild improvement but failed to seriously threaten. SANCTIFY broke slow, was unhurried into stride and passed only the tiring ones.
FLOWERY PATH contended four wide to the stretch and faded. BANSHEE MOON was unhurried, went wide and was never a factor. LANDY failed to
respond. BRIGHT LADY DAY was close up along the inside for a half and dropped out. CATALINA NINA saved ground to no avail.
