Footnotes
AKITO brushed an inner rival leaving the gates, showed the way well in hand and a bit off of the fence around the turn, inched clear in upper stretch and
held sway under drive while hanging on his left lead. WILDERZAR laid off of the pace along the inside advanced in the four path into and around the turn,
sustained a rally to take aim on the clear leader in the late stages but was only second best. FATHER OF LIES brushed an inner rival at the start, stalked
the leader from the three path, was roused in pursuit turning for home, but yielded after being outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch and held show.
MOON OVER DUBAI was brushed by an outer rival and forced to bump an inner foe at the start, tracked along the inside, came under heavy urging into the
turn and gave way through the lane. TWELVE MINUS ONE was bumped by an outer foe at the start, raced towards the rear in the five path and failed to
factor. JAYDEN'S PRINCE brushed with an outer rival t the start, chased in the three path and between for a quarter mile, but weakened into the turn and
was done early.

between horses into the turn, shifted out to the four to five path in upper stretch and ran on late for a minor share. HOLIDAY DECISION pressed the leader
from the three path, vied turning for home, led as an bidder ranged up entering the lane, got bested by that one in midstretch and gave way through the final

Footnotes
CHIRON tracked along the inside, bid along the rail around the far turn, led in upper stretch and drove clear. SHORTLY prompted inside of the leader and
from the two path before backing off to stalk entering the backstretch, rebid outside of that one leaving the half mile pole, led into the far turn before an inner
rival offered a challenge, but drifted to the four path entering the lane and was bested in upper stretch. QUICK QUICK WHIT laid off of the pace three wide,
chased two wide around the far turn and kept on. GLOBAL PRIDE raced off of the pace four wide, chased three wide around the far turn and yielded.
ROYAL AIR FORCE lagged behind in the five path and was outrun. RANSAM PAYNTER leaned outwardly at the start, set the pace in the three path before
tucking to the inside down the backstretch, but faltered entering the far turn and was done early.

Footnotes
LOCK ON tracked from midpack two wide, moved forward to take aim on the leader in upper stretch, bid at the furlong grounds and drove clear.
UHAVETOBEKITTENME set the pace inside of a pressing foe, drew clear entering the lane, but was bested by an outer bidder in the final furlong.
SUDDENLY SEDUCTIVE raced off of the pace in the five path, shifted in to split foes in the three path nearing the furlong grounds, gained show shortly
after and held that position from an outer bidder. HONOR LIFE laid off of the pace in the six path, then stayed on to attempt a late bid for show bid needed
more. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair entering the lane but was floated to the five path in the process, then
lacked a bid. BLUE SKY'S ABOVE took light contact from an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path and failed to menace. AMES
MISTER leaned inwardly and brushed a rival while off slow, trailed then improved position. FRANK N DUCKY prompted outside of the leader and from the
three path around the turn, but drifted to the four path entering the lane and folded between horses. RESCUE FIVE stalked in the four path, but drifted out to
the eight path entering upper stretch and faded. TUFF ATTACK pursued from midpack along the inside but weakened into the turn.
