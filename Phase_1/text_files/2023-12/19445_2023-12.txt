WALDRIP stalked the early pace while two wide into the turn, rallied and split horses nearing the quarter pole, was in a long drive while still two wide in the
stretch and prevailed in the end. SLEW SKIES dueled for the lead while two wide on the backstretch, was inside on the turn and in a long hard drive
throughout the stretch but was out finished in the final strides. BIG TAP was stalking the pace then rallied four wide on the turn making a strong bid to upper
stretch but flattened out in the drive and jumped the finish line light. PACIFIC THEATER stalked the pace while three wide into the turn, made a strong bid to
upper stretch but faltered in the drive. WHAT THE HEY was allowed to settled while inside on the turn then swung out to be five wide in upper stretch and
failed to menace. I AM ON THE LIST dueled for the lead while inside on the backstretch, was used up then gave way. CODE ELEVEN dropped back and
trailed.
