Footnotes
MY FIRST DATE saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the
far turn and gained ground quickly in the lane to get up for the win late. EMPIRE GIRL raced in the two path around the first bend, dueled on the outside up
the backstretch, took over to lead outright from the two path coming around the far turn and dug in in the stretch but was caught in the final strides.
EXAGERADORA raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far
turn still in the three path and improved position from there. GLADIATORA raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, saved
ground around the far turn and finished evenly. BLACK AND SILVER raced in the four path around the first bend, pressed the pace on the outside up the
backstretch, dueled from the two path around the second bend and weakened in the lane. FONE YOUR MOM saved ground early, dueled on the inside up
the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path, gave way approaching the quarter pole and faded from there. AMARULA SUN saved
ground around the first bend, moved up to challenge on the outside racing up the backstretch, dropped back while racing on the rail around the far turn and
continued to tire in the lane.

COUNTLESS DREAMS bumped mildly with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to duel between horses up the backstretch, continued to
battle from the two path around the turn and kicked clear in the lane. R LOVE ON THE RUN dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle
from the three path around the bend and could not go with the winner in the stretch but chased that rival home. DANCE STEP hit the gate leaving it, stalked
the pace setters on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the turn in the three path and kept on to the finish. SHEA ON A
MISSION raced off the pace on the inside early, came around the turn in the two path and improved position mildly in the stretch. CHILD PROOF raced in
the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and finished evenly. TRULY A DREAM raced off the pace on the outside
through the opening stages, continued around the bend in the three path and showed no kick. ROWDY DAISY pressed the pace on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded from there. MONTANA JOYCE tracked the leaders through the early going, saved ground around the
bend and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
CHIQUIRIN raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid from the rail passing the quarter
pole and dueled to the wire to hold the win. WAR CROSS tracked the pace setter on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, challenged from the
two path coming around the turn and dueled to the finish to narrowly miss. SIR KAHN raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch,
began a bid from the three path passing the three eighths pole and chased on to the wire. LITIGANT chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch,
continued around the bend in the three path and weakened from there. ERLAN raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the bend and
improved position mildly in the lane but never truly threatened. POLITICAL RIOT was pinched back leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the outside for
the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and made no bid. BEAST OR FAMINE led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled
from the two path around the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
NICE BABY led the way between horses racing up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and drew off in the stretch. OPEN SKY pressed the
pace on the outside through the early going, continued around the bend in the three path and kept on in the lane. UNIFIEDS PRINCESS dropped back to
trail the field racing up the backstretch, began to move up while saving ground around the turn and continued to improve position in the stretch. LA BEFANA
bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and
showed no kick. JULIANNA'S RUBY bumped lightly with the horse to her outside at the break, raced in the middle of the pack on the rail through the
opening quarter, continued around the turn in the four path, swung wider still into the stretch and never threatened. LONGING FOR MINTS stalked the
leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the stretch. GATOR TWENTY FIVE tracked the leader on the outside up
the backstretch, navigated the bend from the three path and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
PAPA FUNNY bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, raced in the two path around the first turn, settled at the back of the pack from there, began
a bid from the three path coming around the far turn and gained ground steadily to the wire to get up for the win late. TWO MINUTES APART bumped with
the horse to his inside leaving the gate, saved ground early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, came around the far bend
in the two path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and dueled in late stretch to just miss. SPANISH NOBLE raced in the three path around the first
turn, led the way up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the second turn and dug in gamely in the lane but was caught in the final strides.
GUN RIGHT tracked the leader on the inside through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn still in the two path and was outkicked in the
stretch. MINTENON raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the
second turn, dueled in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. FOREVER SAUCY raced off the pace on the outside around the first turn and up the
backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. SWING SAMMY saved ground early, settled off the pace on the inside
for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend and never threatened. AMERICAN DAY raced in the two path around the
first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn still in the two path and showed no kick. BORDER
PATROL raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three path and
faded in the lane. NOBLE HERO raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and was
not a factor.
