Footnotes
SIMPLY STRIKING tracked the pace two wide, tipped out in upper stretch, closed steadily and was up in deep stretch. SKINNY COSMO set the pace in the
two path and led until deep stretch. WOW LUCKY hopped at the start, saved ground off the pace, edged closer two wide between foes around the far turn,
angled three wide in upper stretch and was along for the show. CHANNEL LOOP saved ground in midpack, steadied near the quarter pole, tipped two wide
turning for home, raced in somewhat tight quarters in upper stretch and was one-paced through the lane. NORTHERN ROAD was bumped at the start,
raced off the pace two wide, went four wide around the far turn and passed tiring rivals. ASHIMA stalked the pace in the three path and tired in the drive.
BROKEN BANKER raced up close inside and came up empty in the lane. ANNAMARIA bumped NORTHERN ROAD at the start, raced three wide and
never threatened. SHINKA played no factor while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
MEGAN MAKIN MONEY broke out and bumped an outer foe, set the pace in the two path, tipped to the rail and opened up slightly around the turn, was
cued in the two path in upper stretch, continued to go clear, and was wrapped up late. SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL stalked in the four path, was cued approaching
the quarter, and chased home the winner in the five path down the stretch for place. UPSTREET raced off the pace in the five path, fanned out to the seven
path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. GREEK MOJO got bumped between foes and pinched at the start, pressed in the three path, was driven
in the two path around the turn, but faded in the stretch. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased and tipped to the rail going
into the turn, floated out to the four path at the top of the lane, but was tired. SWEET SENSATION trailed in the two path and never threatened. GLASS
STAR raced up close in the five path, but was empty turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
BELLESHAZZA prompted the pace in the three path, took over near the five-sixteenths pole and kicked clear under left-handed urging. APEROL SPRITZ
stalked the pace four wide, bid outside of the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole, could not match strides with that foe but kept on to be clearly second
best. MERRY GOLD set the pace in the two path, was collared by the winner near the five-sixteenths marker and lasted for the show. LADY TREMAINE
broke slowly, saved ground in midpack, tipped out in upper stretch and was one-paced through the lane. BREAKING BULLET tracked the pace four and five
and weakened in the lane. A J'S MEMORY was outrun while racing two and three wide. FOR THE THRILL played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
LET'S GO PHILLY rated off the pace three wide, steadied near the three-eighths pole, angled four wide turning for home, surged and was up and clear late.
SINGING SANDRA set the pace along the rail, drew clear around the far turn and led until deep stretch. MAINSTREAM SELLOUT raced three and four
wide in midpack and had a mild rally to gain the show. NUNOFTHISNUNOFTHAT was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace angled out turning for
home and rallied belatedly. RED SUN DRESS dueled outside of the winner for a half, chased two wide around the far turn and weakened in the lane.
BRACCESCA vied between foes through the opening quarter, rated back late on the first turn and had no substantial response when roused around the far
turn. SURVIVAL ROSE was bumped at the start and outrun inside.

Footnotes
SIMPLIFY (ARG) broke out at the start, stalked in the three path, bid passing the three-eighths, was carried out to the five path by the inner pacesetter
turning into the lane, stuck her head in front passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. LA RUNA raced up close in the four path, lost ground in the three path
around the turn, tipped into the two path entering the stretch, and kept on to be up for place. LOOKING FOR HOPE set the pace in the two path, was roused
passing the three-eighths, dug in while floating out to the four path going into the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong to show. I BELIEVE IN MAGIC
bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the five path, was driven from the four path into the stretch, but was one paced. LE BOIANA chased inside,
angled out to the seven path at the top of the lane, but did not threaten. GOLDCREST bumped with an outer foe at the start and had to steady just after,
trailed throughout around the four path.

Footnotes
SCARAMANGA set the pace in the three path, was nudged along from the rail around the turn, floated back out to the three path while being cued at the top
of the lane, and held gamely. ANTILLEAN raced wellback in the five path, was driven in the four path around the turn, angled out to the seven path in upper
stretch, and rallied for place. NORFIE stalked in the five path, ranged up to bid in the four path turning into the lane, was repelled by the winner in the final
sixteenth, but kept on for show. PRIX DE WEST tracked in the six path, was roused in the four path midway around the turn, swung back out to the six path
at the top of the stretch, but was one paced. DOC BALLARD chased in the four path, tipped out to the five path under a drive turning into the stretch, but
flattened on his left lead. GINGERSNAP JACK raced in midpack in the two path, cut the corner under a ride turning into the lane, but made no impact.
SKYHOOPER broke thru the gate during the loading process, prompted the pace in the five path, bid in the three path early around the turn, was coaxed
passing the quarter, but faded between foes in the stretch. WILD FLIGHT broke out at the start, trailed in the seven path and never threatened.
HANDSOME RUNNER had an awkward start, raced off the pace along the inside into the turn but never menaced.
