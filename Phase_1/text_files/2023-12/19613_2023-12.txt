Footnotes
CAPTURE MY DREAMS raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in
the two path and gained ground late to get up for the win. NUMERIC saved ground early, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from
the rail around the far bend and dug in gamely in the lane, getting caught in the final strides. TIPHARAH raced in the three path early, settled in the middle
of the pack for the run up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the second turn and improved position in the stretch. MARTINI'S AMICA raced
in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, angled in to save ground around the far bend and passed tiring
horses in the lane. CAPTURE THIS tracked the leader on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path
and faded from there. ZIPPY ZINNY raced in the four path early, came up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, continued around the second turn in
the three path and made no bid. ENCHANTMENT (FR) raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back
while saving ground around the second turn and tired further in the lane.

Footnotes
KING FALIERO led the way on the inside racing up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and drew off in the lane. A BIT OF CAPTAIN
bumped mildly with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to press the pace between horses racing up the backstretch, continued around the
turn in the two path and chased the winner home in the lane, no match for that rival. SA SA SA raced in the middle of the pack early, began a bid from the
three path coming around the turn and kept on to the finish. ICONIC ROCK bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, recovered to track the pace
setter on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and was outkicked in the lane. GRAY MEDALLION raced off the pace on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the turn in the two path and never threatened. TONADO trailed the field through the early going,
navigated the bend from the two path and never threatened. PRINCE DAVID veered in sharply leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the outside for the
run up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and made no bid. STRAY PRINCE raced at the back of the pack on the outside early,
angled in to save ground while trailing the field around the turn and was empty in the stretch.

outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far bend still in the two path, challenged in upper stretch and could not get by the winner. SLIME
QUEEN raced in the two path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three path and kept
on to the finish. INANNA'S QUEST saved ground early, trailed the field up the backstretch, swung out the five path to began a bid nearing the quarter pole
and improved position in the lane. STEPPER saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the
backstretch, navigated the second turn from the three path and finished evenly. PACIFIC PRINCESS raced in the middle of the pack on the far outside
through the opening half mile, came around the far turn still in the four path and never threatened. HIGH VIBES raced in the three path around the first
bend, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, swung out to the four path coming around the far bend and passed tiring horses in the
stretch while never threatening. THAT'S MY CAT raced in the three path early, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the
far turn still in the three path and faded in the lane. DOMINEERING raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on
the inside, saved ground around the far bend and made no bid. GLITTER BAY saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the

around the turn in the two path and improved position in the lane. FONE YOUR MOM raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch,
continued around the turn in the three path and finished evenly. AMARULA SUN chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile,
saved ground around the turn and weakened in the lane. SUMMER GOLD led the way on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and
tired in the stretch. MAUREEN bumped soundly with the horses to either side leaving the gate, dropped back quickly to trail the field early, raced off the
pace on the inside up what remained of the backstretch, continued around the bend in the two path and showed no kick. THIRSTY DATE bumped with the
horse to his outside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no
bid. AGUA ROJA raced at the back of the pack on the outside early, saved ground around the turn and was not a factor. ROMASHKA stalked the leader on

Footnotes
CANNON'S ROAR saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and dueled gamely to
the wire to just hold the win. THE PENINSULA raced in the two path around the first bend, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch,
navigated the far bend from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground late to just miss. AMERICAN UNITY raced in the
two path around the first turn, stalked the leader between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the second bend and
dueled gamely to the finish to just miss. SIR TERRE raced in the three path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, swung out to the
four path coming around the bend and improved position in the stretch. IRWANI (ARG) saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside
up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and was outkicked in the stretch. FLY NIGHTLY saved ground around the first bend,
settled off the pace on the inside up the backstretch and around the far bend and never threatened. TWO BY TWO trailed the field from the two path
through the opening half mile, came around the second turn still in the two path and showed no kick. GUNSLINGER (IRE) hopped up leaving the gate,
raced in the four path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside, swung out to the four path coming around the far turn and was
empty in the lane. GHOST OF KHOZAN raced in the two path early, chased the leader up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path
and tired in the stretch. KING RAMOS tracked the leader from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around
the far turn and faded in the lane.
