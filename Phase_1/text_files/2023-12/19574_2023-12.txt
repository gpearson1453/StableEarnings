Footnotes
WILDCAT EXPRESS took command shortly away from the gate while well held, cleared into the turn and widened his advantage steadily without ever being
seriously threatened. MANNFORD missed the break to be away at the back of the field, circled the field on the bend in a long drive to gain and hold the
place in a good effort. RECKLESS L J stalked the pacesetter to the head of the stretch and failed to gain ground in the drive. PRIVATE DRIVE tracked the
pace from three wide through the turn and went evenly failing to mount a closing bid. TIGER TRAIL hustled along the fence to prominent early, chased the
leaders through the turn and lacked a late response. JOSH'N trailed most of the way and was never a threat. MASTEROFTHEHOUNDS was never a factor
and bled.

Footnotes
PROSECUTOR set a pressured pace while well held in the early going, responded to all challenges, gamely battled through the lane and just prevailed by
the shortest of margins on the wire in a game effort. PRESSLEY RIDGE tracked the leaders into the turn, circled five wide entering the bend exchanging
bumps with inside rival, ranged up to engage the pacesetter in upper stretch, dueled through the lane with that one down the lane in close quarters and was
denied at the wire. ORLEANS STORM rated just off the leaders down the backside, was jostled between horses while racing four wide into the turn losing
momentum and kept on in the drive to gain the show. WAR ON THE RIVER stalked the pace into the from three wide, was bumped entering the turn from
the outside causing him to drop in a path in close proximity to inside rival making that one steady off heels, lost position on the bend and finished evenly.
BIG TIME FLIRT pressed the pace down the backside from between horses racing two wide, steadied off heels into the turn when losing racing room while
outside rivals bumped and dropping inside into his path, and lacked any rally after that incident. AGNELLO CITY broke inward toward the gap leaving the
gate and continued on as no threat. PLAYING BALL step slow from the gate and was never a factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY AND THE
RIDER OF BIG TIME FLIRT CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST WAR ON THE RIVER FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE THE TURN NEAR THE THREE-EIGHTHS
POLE, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
CANDY CRUSHEM unhurried early to be well off the pace, circled six wide into the far turn, made a steady advance down the lane and was up in time.
SMASH set the pace from the onset, opened a clear advantage down the backside, widened the lead in the final bend and weakened late to be caught in
the fina lyards. SUDDEN SHIFT slow early to be near the back of the field, made up ground in the final turn, weaved erratically in upper stretch, leveled out
in mid-stretch and closed well to be gaining late. FRANCO reserved off the pace to race mid-pack down the backside, saved ground coming home and
failed to closed ground late. CITY PLAN raced wide in the first turn to move up to prompt the pace through the final bend and weakened coming home.
LAUDA SPEED well placed early and lacked a closing rally. CAMP PENDLETON contended for the first half and had no response when called upon.
KERANOS broke awkwardly, trailed the field to the head o the lane and showed some late interest leveling out in the lane. VENETIAN DREAM tracked the
leaders for a half and gave way.

Footnotes
GOLDEN HEIST reserved off the pace to the turn, rallied from two wide in the bend steadily advancing down the lane, found best stride late and pulled clear
in the late going. ZIPSY ROSE LEE rallied six wide in the turn and kept coming down the lane to be up for the place. MAGGIE E sped to the lead, opened a
wide advantage to mid-stretch and stopped inside the sixteenth pole. CLIMATE unhurried early to be near the rear of the field and made a mild bid in the
stretch. GIO'S MY DAD rallied five wide in the turn and failed to gain down the stretch while continuing to drift wide. STRIKING MELODY stalked the pace to
the top of the lane and faded down the stretch. RAG TOWN failed to menace. BAD AND BEAUTIFUL was never a threat. CHOSEN BY GRACE chased the
pace for a half and came up empty.

Footnotes
YOUVESAIDITALL reserved off the early pace, rallied three wide in the turn to engage the leaders at the head of the lane and drew off in the stretch.
LUCKY JUNIOR pressed the pace throughout and kept on well down the lane to be second best while no match for the winner. TUFF ATTACK set the pace
under pressure to mid-stretch and weakened late in the drive. CALL WEST made an early bid up the fence down the backside to threaten into the far turn
and flattened out coming home. PARADE GRAND went evenly failing to mount a closing rally. ROYAL COUP trailed for a half mile and passed tiring rivals
down the lane. GAMBLER stalked the pace into the final bend and faded. GEH SCHNELL was never a threat. BACK ALLEY CAT showed brief speed to
contend early and came up empty.

Footnotes
DARK VADER unhurried early under patient handling, circled eight wide at the head of the lane and was up late in a determined drive. IT'S OFFICIAL rated
in mid-pack to the quarter pole, split rivals turning for home, took the lead in deep stretch and was caught in the final yards. OAKS HONEY raced wide
throughout rallying from the six path to loom in upper stretch and was out-kicked in the late going. PLAY BALL tracked the leaders through the turn, rallied
from five wide to take command in mid-stretch and weakened late in the drive. COUNTRY CLUB BOBBY well placed along the fence just off the pace,
saved ground cutting the corner coming from home and lacked a good enough closing rally down the lane. TOTELLYOUTHETRUTH pressed the pace to
the head of the lane and flattened out. THEDAYOFTHEGREY set a pressured pace to the quarter pole and gave way in the stretch. QUIET AMIGO failed to
menace. FIRST SONG was never a factor. DERBY INCLUDED was not a threat.

HENRY MAC stalked the pace into the turn, rallied three wide to engage the pacesetter in mid-stretch and drew clear late in the lane. LIBERATE set a well
rated pace, responded when challenged in the lane and was out-finished late in the drive. RAVEN MOON slow early to trail and showed good late interest to
gain the show. LIONISTIC prompted the pace down the backside under stout restraint, was well positioned in the turn to threaten and lacked a closing
response when called upon. SIMON SAYS was never athreat.

Footnotes
EAGLE NEST well rated on the lead down the backside, opened a clear advantage turning for home and widened down the lane without a challenge.
ANGELICO stalked the pacesetter through the turn, mounted a non-threatening bid at the head of the lane and kept on to be second best. IPPOLITO'S
WONDER reserved off the pace down the backside, was in tight quarters into the turn having to be taken in hand, and rallied well down the lane. HAPPY
TAKEOVER raced wide down the backside, was called upon into the turn to mount a rally and flattened out coming home. ORVILLE B tracked the leaders
through the turn and failed to respond when called upon. JOHN PHILIP was never a threat. MUCH TIMES TWO contended early to be well place along the
rail and faded in the turn.
