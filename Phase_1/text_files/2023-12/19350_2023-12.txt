under strong handling. ALMOST DIALED OUT tracked the early leader early, dueled with Be Bo nearing three eighths pole through the far turn and kept on
gamely in the drive. BE BO broke to the outside, bumped rival, cleared off early, duel from the inside near the three eighths pole and weakened a bit through
the drive. KHOZY TAP was bumped soundly at the start, moved up through the far turn, raced seven deep into the upper lane, shifted in through the drive
and improved position. JESSICA BLAH BLAH raced off the early going, moved up three to five wide around the far turn and flattened out from the outside.
PURRFECT MOON was allowed to settle early, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. SECRET MELODY was off very slow,
rushed from the inside early and was empty in the drive.

FOR HARPER stalked the pace from the outside of rivals down the backstretch, loomed three wide around the far turn, raced from the outside in the stretch
and finished well to edge up under strong handling. STRAWBERRY SUNDAE prompt the early leader from the outside, dug in from the inside of For Harper
through the stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. GUITAR WOMAN stalked the early going, raced three wide around the far turn and moved up through
the drive while racing from the outside. LOVERS NEVER SAY broke very awkwardly, had a poor start while losing a considerable amount of ground, angled
in while being coaxed from the inside around the first turn, swung eight wide into the upper stretch and closed in well while racing from the far outside. OUR
LITTLE GIRL dropped back off the early pace, moved up three to four wide into the upper stretch but needed more. HIGHLY WICKED showed good early
speed along the inside and gave way. SIXTH ANNIVERSARY stalked the pace, was near the inside at the three eighths pole, angled out through the stretch
run and weakened. I BEAR ARMS was allowed to settle early on, raced near the inside throughout and had no response. MISS KENNEDY raced far back
and never threatened. MI LIA stalked near the rail and was done early.

Footnotes
A RUNNIN AFLEET settled off the early pace, moved up three to five wide around the far turn and finished well while racing from the far outside.
GUANAJUATO pressed two wide from the outside of Why Wait early on, dug in three deep from the inside of A Runin Afleet three deep in the drive and kept
on gamely to the wire. HOT PATOOTIE stalked the pace, loomed four wide around the far turn and flattened out while racing from the outside. MRS.
NECAISE stalked the pace from the inside, raced near the inside past the three eighths pole, dropped back a bit, angled out through the upper stretch and
moved up late. AGAMI dropped back to race near the back early, raced from the far outside in the lane and lacked a rally. WHY WAIT showed good early
foot from the inside and gave way. CRYPTO BRAVE stalked the pace along the inside and tired. SUPER ET was reluctant to load, broke slow, raced at the
back after the poor start, swung wide and never menaced.

Footnotes
CASH FEVER showed good early foot to cross over and set the early pace, angled off the rail into the upper to race four deep, shifted back in and held well
under strong handling. AMANWALKSINTOABAR stalked the pace, took aim at the leader near the quarter pole from the outside and finished second best.
Jockey of Amanwalksintoabar claimed objection for interference against Cash Fever near the quarter pole and stewards ruled no change. MO SATURDAYS
stalked the early pace, raced from the inside around the far turn into the stretch, angled out near the eighth pole and kept on to the wire. GREAT RUNNER
dropped back off the early pace, angled to race widest in the stretch and moved up to improve position. DAZZLEMESILVER dropped back to race mid pack,
swung seven wide into the upper stretch and raced even with no final bid. Z Z'S PRINCE chased the early pace from the inside and weakened.
HOGSLAYERS R I P dropped back early, raced five wide around the far turn and had no rally from the outside. BRILLIANT SPIN chased the pace from the
outside and tired readily.

Footnotes
WARDY tracked the early leader from the inside, eased out through the upper stretch, drifted through the stretch, coaxed back in late under right handded
urging and was well clear under steady pressure. PURPLE OCTOPUS was quick to begin to set the early but was no match for the winner in the drive. YO
DADDY was off a step slow, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and moved up to improve position. DYNAMIC SUN was allowed to
settle early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and raced even with no closing bid. PARKING LOT was allowed to settle early and failed to respond.
DREAM TIME coaxed along early, raced two to three wide around the far turn and faded. SIXTEEN DEGREES coaxed along two deep from the outside of
rival and stopped.

Footnotes
RIGHTANDJUST was sent along from the outside to set the early pace, raced just off the inside down the backstretch, continued to race off the inside in the
stretch and held well to be clear under steady handling. GREY STREAK tracked the early leader early, made an early bid near the rail at the three eighths
pole to challenge but was no match for the winner in the drive. SEDUCTIVE U S A was unhurried early, moved up from the inside into the upper stretch,
angled out through the drive and improved position. HE'S GOT THIS stalked the pace while racing in hand and weakened in the drive racing five wide.
SOUL COAXING rated from the outside of rivals under a firm hold and faded. MALTHAEL settled off the early pace two deep between rivals and never was
a factor.

Footnotes
SHAWN'S SOLVING quick to begin from the outside to assume early command and drew off in the stretch under mild urging, raced in hand inside the
eighth pole and was a handy winner. VERO CAMPIONE dropped back early on, raced from the inside around the far turn, angled out through the upper lane
and rallied for the place position. MINE YOUR BIZ settled off the early going, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and moved up late to narrowly
miss the place position. SAMURAI'S GRANDSON tracked the top pair from the inside and weakened through the drive. LINCOLN PRODUCTION was
squeezed back at the start, raced from the inside into the upper stretch and race evenly late while continuing with an inside run. RED IDOL stalked the pace
from the outside, raced three deep around the far turn and faded. IRON FORTUNE dropped back to race with the second flight early, hard ridden three to
five wide around the far turn and had no rally while racing from the far outside. QUEENIE'S LEROY no early speed, raced from the far outside in the lane
and had no response. PUNCHIE broke thru gate pre-race, did not run off, walked to the back of gate reloaded, broke awkwardly, chased the pace from the
inside and faded. DREWNANIMOUS settled and failed to have a response. ONDATRACKPIMPERNEL was squeezed back at the break, lost ground to race
far back and never menaced.
