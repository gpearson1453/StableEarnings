Footnotes
DARK MYSTERY tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, was well positioned along the backstretch run and was steered two then three wide
to the quarter marker, ran evenly to the furlong pole, rallied inside of the sixteenth marker, wore down foes in deep stretch and got up in time to prevail at the
finish. WORKDAY sent to establish the early lead, set decent fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the
quarter marker, repelled RANCHO RED into the stretch and shook free nearing the furlong marker, the rider lost his crop nearing the sixteenth-pole, was all
out to hold off oncoming rivals into deep stretch and was tagged on the wire for the win, while just holding for second. WINTER SOLDIER unhurried leaving
the break, settled into the backstretch run and was content to trail to the half-mile marker while not far back, saved ground into the far turn, tipped two wide
and was asked for run nearing the furlong marker, finished well into the final sixteenth, vied between runners in deep stretch and missed for the win and
place, while well clear for the show. RANCHO RED forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the decent pace through the backstretch run, challenged
WORKDAY at the quarter marker, was repelled in that effort and lost ground into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and gave way.
PORT O' CALL tracked the decent pace from the outside, raced widest through the backstretch run and was coaxed along three then four wide along the far
turn, was outrun into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
UNCLE LEON broke a step slowly leaving the start, recovered and tracked the decent early pace from the inside, shifted two wide into the turn and gained
ground nearing the quarter marker, loomed into upper stretch and took command heading to the furlong marker, drew to a clear lead at the sixteenth-pole,
felt mild late pressure from the runner-up and held safely in a drive for the win. ZEN STATE allowed to settle in the early stages, was steered two wide to the
quarter marker, mounted a four wide rally into the stretch and gained ground heading to the furlong pole, closed willingly into the final sixteenth, put mild
pressure on the winner in deep stretch and outfinished the rest to claim second. CLEAR THE COAST showed good early speed and established the pace
away from the start, set decent fractions into the turn and showed the way to the quarter pole, was overtaken by UNCLE LEON into the stretch and chased
to the furlong marker, needed more in deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while just holding for third. ROCKET RIBBON forwardly placed in the
early stages, chased three wide to the quarter marker, maintained a three wide path into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, lacked a final
response in deep stretch and missed for third at the wire. HALF THROTTLE a bit green away from the start, lost contact with the rest and chased from far
back in the early going, was steered to the inside and chased into upper stretch, showed good late interest but was not a factor. AUTISM INCLUSION
chased the decent early pace from the inside, maintained an inside path into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, lacked a late response and
weakened.

Footnotes
TIGER ATTACK hustled away from the start, assumed command and was engaged in the early going by MAVERICK ROSE, contested the pace inside of
that rival into the turn, dueled for pace duties along the bend and battled with MAVERICK ROSE into upper stretch, repelled that rival approaching the
furlong marker, was kept to task while holding foes at bay to the sixteenth-marker, dug in determinedly in deep stretch and lasted for the win at the finish.
CARDINAL TRICK forwardly placed leaving the start, came under an early hold while between runners heading to the half-mile marker, found room along
the turn and improved position two wide at the quarter pole, shifted three then four wide for the drive and chased to mid-stretch, responded to urging and
rallied in the final sixteenth, could not get by the winner in deep stretch and won the nod for second on the wire. I AM AMADEO prominent in the early going,
took back to track the contested pace and saved ground into the turn, lost position along the bend and chased to the quarter marker, maintained an inside
path into the stretch re-rallied at the furlong pole, closed willingly into the final sixteenth, could not get by the determined winner in deep stretch and just
missed for second at the finish. MAVERICK ROSE asked for early speed, engaged with TIGER ATTACK and contested decent early fractions with that rival,
dueled outside of TIGER ATTACK into the turn and took a short lead at the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch but battled with TIGER ATTACK to
the furlong marker, could not match strides into the final sixteenth and tired. SEA BREEZE BOY forwardly placed early on, tracked the pace outside of
runners heading to the turn, chased three then four wide nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and weakened. CALLUM rated off
of the contentious early pace while not far back, chased two wide to the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS unhurried from the start and was allowed to settle near the rear of the field while holding the rail, began to move towards the
leaders through the far turn while staying to the inside, encountered traffic from the five-sixteenths to the head of the stretch, tipped out to the two path just
past the three-sixteenths pole, responded to the urging of the rider, surged to the front and won clear. GRIGORO broke well but settled into a tracking trip
mid-pack and three deep through the early going, stayed in the clear taking a four to five wide path through the far turn, was set down approaching the
quarter pole and responded with a good finish down the lane but came up short. CLASS CODE was sent from the break, grabbed the early lead through the
first turn but was joined by PANDEMIC GIRL and SHANGHAI MIST heading into the backstretch run, allowed the former to take a short lead while the latter
dropped out of the developing speed duel, took back the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, took a short lead into the stretch, kept on well under intermittent
urging but was outfinished near the wire. SHERILINDA was one of the first into the clubhouse turn but opted out of a potential speed duel, took up a tracking
spot along the rail, got boxed through the far turn but got a fortunate opening to run through at the head of the stretch and finished evenly under strong
handling. DRAMATIZER lacked any speed from the break but saved ground to the far turn while settling at the back of the field, moved closer heading into
the far turn, saved ground but found a wall of horses in front while full of run, continued to be blocked for most of the stretch run with no path to the outside
then surged in the final yards when finally clear. PANDEMIC GIRL went four wide into the first turn and circled the field pulling the rider to the front, took a
short lead approaching the half mile marker, weakened under pressure near the quarter pole and tired in the stretch. SHANGHAI MIST was forwardly
placed going into the first turn then in the middle of a trio contesting the early lead passing the six furlong pole, backed out of the potential speed duel near
the five furlong marker, chased the top two through the far turn, tried to mount a rally passing the five-sixteenths pole but did not have the needed response.

Footnotes
PETER FLIES prominent in the early stages, assumed command and set a solid pace while clear into the turn, was well handled through decent fractions
along the turn, maintained a clear lead into the stretch while in hand, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and extended the lead into deep stretch, was
geared down in the final strides and was much the best in the end. COOLWIND slow away from the start, was unhurried in the early going and trailed into
the turn, improved position two wide at the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive, shifted to the five path at mid-stretch and ran evenly to the furlong
marker, rallied in the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to secure second. I CAN'T HEAR YOU
forwardly placed leaving the start, took back and tracked the solid early pace heading into the turn, mounted a three wide bid at the quarter marker,
maintained a three wide path into the stretch and continued his advance at the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth,
was tagged in the final strides for second and just held at the wire for third. SARK tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, raced three wide into
the turn and improved position at the quarter marker, tipped four wide for the drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch, needed more in the final sixteenth, finished
evenly and missed for the minor awards. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE rated off of the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn and advanced at the quarter
marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and rallied at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and weakened late.
WHENTHEFOGLIFTS fractious in the gate prior to the start, was away in good order and prominent to begin, pulled on the rider while chasing the solid
early pace, raced two wide into the turn and gained ground approaching the quarter marker, chased into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong pole,
lacked a response in the final sixteenth and gave way. CANTILEVER allowed to settle away from the start, saved ground into the turn and trailed to the
quarter pole, ran evenly in the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
LILA AT THE BEACH broke well but allowed the pace scenario to play out while sitting just behind, rated patiently while full run thorough the turn, became
boxed in from the five-sixteenths to the three-sixteenths poles, got clear before the furlong marker, pulled ahead and held sway in the final yards. SHOUT IT
OUT was last away then hustled to get into contention, circled the field on the turn, came into the stretch four wide and finished well under intermittent
urging and just got up for the place. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN broke a little slow and dropped back to last in the compact field, saved ground racing on the rail
through the turn then got boxed in from the quarter pole to mid-stretch, steadied in traffic near the eighth pole then re-rallied when clear to gain third. TRULY
FABULOUS steadied off heels a few yards from the gate, lost some ground then made steady forward progress to regain contact with the leading group
going into the turn, was waiting for room through the turn when forced to check behind MISS SKI, remained inside and was stuck behind a wall of horses
going into the stretch, deftly switched to the five path near the sixteenth pole and finished up well. RED NOON RISING came away from the break best,
dueled for the lead through the turn, came into the stretch with a short lead, held sway to just before the eighth pole and weakened in the final furlong.
DON'T TELL HYDEE broke alertly and was on the outside of four contesting the early lead, dropped back before the turn the started a forward move from
the three furlong marker, was bidding for the lead three wide in the turn for home then had some trouble changing leads down the stretch and was
outfinished. MISS SKI was sent from the break and was three wide and part of a scramble for the early lead, came under a drive from the seven-sixteenth
pole then gave way when surrounded through the turn, found renewed energy once clear but was unable to threaten from that point. MARY WALKER broke
sharply from the inside and raced on the inside of RED NOON RISING on the lead through the initial stages, dueled inside through the turn, had a very short
lead near the three-sixteenths pole then tired passing the furlong marker and faded.

COWBOY CHARLIE away from the start in good order, cleared the field in the early stages and set quick fractions while pressed into the turn, shook free
and drew to a clear lead heading to the quarter marker, widened the lead into the stretch, drew off under hand urging in deep stretch and was much the
best. LESSONS OF AUTISM broke in at the start, made contact with DESCARTES and was away a bit slowly, chased the solid pace from the second flight,
improved position three wide at the quarter marker, tipped four wide for the drive, closed in the stretch but was no match for the winner and bested the rest.
MY DOMINATOR hustled to be forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the solid pace from the inside then chased the fast pace along the turn, made a
mild gain into the stretch and chased COWBOY CHARLIE to the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth and was
outfinished for second, while just holding for third. COBRA JET allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the turn and chased to the quarter
marker, made a mild advance into the stretch, lacked the needed late response and finished evenly, while just missing for show honors. COUNTING
CARDS tracked the quick early pace from the second flight, raced in tight into the turn and steadied off of heels leaving the three-furlong pole, recovered
then waited for racing room at the top of the stretch, navigated traffic heading to the furlong marker then found a narrow opening into the final sixteenth,
encountered traffic again in deep stretch while gaining ground and altered course in the final strides. DESOTO'S WAR forwardly placed in the early running,
rated off the solid pace and tracked between horses into the turn, lost position along the bend and chased two then three wide to the quarter pole, lacked a
response in the stretch and did not threaten. DESCARTES bothered at the start by a neighboring rival and was off slowly, lacked early speed and trailed into
the turn, chased two wide to the quarter marker then angled five wide for the drive, gained ground at the furlong pole, could not sustain that run into the final
sixteenth and weakened. DECIMATE asked for speed leaving the break, raced close up to the fast early pace and pressed COWBOY CHARLIE into the
turn, lost position along the bend and chased two wide to the quarter marker, dropped back into upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
YOU ENJOY MYSELF broke in sharply but managed to avoid contact, tracked just behind the pacesetters to turn, launched a bid for the lead after passing
the three furlong marker, in deep stretch had to navigate past an erratic FORDY G while also getting squeezed from the outside by RESERVE PROOF split
those two and finished willingly under strong handling to prevail. RESERVE PROOF was allowed to settle into stride, was near the rear of the field in the
early going but gained momentum heading into the turn, responded when put into a drive from the three furlong marker, came out four wide into the stretch,
ran on under strong took a brief lead, shifted in under right handed urging near the sixteenth pole, gathered up and finished well but came up short. SENOR
DEL CAMPO came away from the gate a little awkwardly and spotted the field a head start, was patiently ridden at the rear of the field down the
backstretch, then saved some ground through the turn, swung out into the clear for the stretch run and finished well to gain the third spot. FORDY G broke
in sharply, dueled with HOGMANAY (IRE) to the turn, took command passing the five-sixteenths pole, drifted out in the stretch while failing to change leads
and was passed in the final furlong. BAILS HIM OUT broke well, chased the dueling leaders to the turn, became boxed in from the five-sixteenths pole to the
top of the stretch but did not have a response when asked and finished one-paced to the finish. DRAW SOME showed some speed and was close up for a
furlong, struggled to keep pace through the turn, stayed on the rail into the stretch and passed a couple of stragglers in last furlong. HOGMANAY (IRE)
broke best but ceded the lead before the five furlong marker, came back on and dueled inside of FORDY G to the stretch, kept to the inside path while that
rival drifted out but weakened in the final furlong. HICKORY WIND was reluctant to load then slow to get into stride from the break, was being prompted by
the rider to stay in contact with the field heading into the turn then drifted very wide passing the five-sixteenths pole, lost ground and was not a factor from
that point.
