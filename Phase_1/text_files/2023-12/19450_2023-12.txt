Footnotes
BARONESS BOURBON was well placed just off the pace, raced inside early on the turn, moved to the two path near the three-eighths then gained to make
a bid, took the lead passing the five-sixteenths, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch, shook clear into the final sixteenth and proved best
under steady urging. RALEIGH ST. CLAIR was carried in at the start, raced well off the pace under urging, came under vigorous urging late on the
backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn and earned the place while no threat to the winner. RUDY RUDY RUDY showed the way down the
backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, lost the lead passing the five-sixteenths, fought on under a drive until near the sixteenth-pole
then weakened while just able to get the show. MIGHTY GLORY moved up then was forwardly placed on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, made a
brief bid near the three-eighths, chased while remaining on her left lead until near the sixteenth-pole and tired. WISE CONVERSATION was well spotted
down the backstretch, started the turn in the two path, was beaten to a hole outside the three-eighths then steadied, dropped to the rail before the
five-sixteenths and failed to rally. NOBLE ONE broke in at the start, was urged along at the back, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. MAX S broke
a step slow, moved up on the outside to contest the pace, dropped back three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and faltered then was eased
in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
JOEY THE FISH vied for the early lead in between rivals, then outside a duo on the turn, made a three wide bid and drew off in the lane to prove much the
best, driving. SHASI vied for the early lead two wide, then was between on the turn, proved to be no match for the winner while staying on to be second
best. ALTERINA vied for the early lead in between rivals four wide, then chased the pace four wide on the turn, swung out six wide leaving the turn and was
along for the show award. SHIGEKO pressed the early pace from the inside, then went up to vie for the lead along the rail and weakened the final furlong.
PROPER GRAMMAR was rated early two wide, then was two to three wide on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn and was empty. LEMON
TAFFY vied for the lead early on the outside, then chased the pace five wide on the turn and tired.

SWEET AS SUGAR was hustled to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, controlled the action while inside on the turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive, drew off into the final furlong and held under steady urging. SIMPLE SUGAR chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn,
pursued the winner in the stretch and willingly earned the place. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH switched outside the leader early, was urged along off the pace,
angled four wide near the three-eighths pole, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. MADDIE'S
SURPRISE was urged along at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DIAMOND
COLLECTOR was sent hard from the start, chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path and tired. LUNA LOCA was urged along on the outside,
went four then five wide on the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
GENTLEMAN JOE was settled early on the outside, made a five wide move by the quarter pole and took over leaving the turn, then drew out to prove best,
driving. MARKET ALERT was shifted out early to be rated four to five wide, made a four wide move by the quarter pole, shifted to the outside leaving the
three sixteenths and held the place award late while no match to the winner. SITTIN ON GO settled early in the two path, then chased the pace towards the
inside, two wide by the quarter pile and finished willingly to miss the place award. ALFIO was off a step slow, angled in by the seven eighths marker to the
rail, reserved while saving ground and then passed the tiring rivals. CLASSIC MARK vied for the early lead on the outside, then chased the pace three wide
on the turn and tired. TWO THIRTY FIVE vied for the early lead in the three path but to the inside of a rival, then set the pace while clear on the inside on
the turn, but faltered in the lane while drifting out.

Footnotes
LOTSA TROUBLE was coaxed to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside, was asked in the two path on the turn, responded well when put
to the crop in upper stretch and proved best under steady urging. OUTTAWATERBURY tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn,
pursued the winner in the stretch and was second best. SEBA M was urged along off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, chased inside on the
turn and weakened while clear for the show. SHORE TIME settled off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, moved closer late on the
backstretch, chased in the two path while between foes on the turn and tired. AVA'S UNCLE BILLY was urged along on the outside, dropped back five wide
on the turn, moved to the four path near the quarter-pole and failed to respond. FRATELLINO pressed the pace while well out in the track, chased between
foes in the three path on the turn and faltered.

WHAT'S UP BRO set the pace while clear and racing off the rail, three wide by the quarter pole, floated out to the five path off the turn, then drifted farher
out through the lane and remained clear to the wire to prove best, driving. M B'S MUNNING tracked the early pace three wide, three to four wide on the turn,
ran on willingly to the wire but could not get to the winner, clearly second best. JESTER'S SONG was settled early, then made a mild bid four to five wide on
the turn to chase the front runners, then had no late kick while staying on for the show award. SKI PATROL chased the pace and was five wide on the turn,
came wide into the lane and had a belated rally. HE'S GOT IT was allowed to settle early, inside on the turn but lacked the needed rally. ROCK THE
WEEKEND was bumped at the start, then was not a threat. MIDNIGHT WORKER was bumped at the start, raced wide and was not a factor.
PLAYINGWITHMATCHES chased the pace three wide and tired.

QUALITY CHIC went around the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, rallied to make a four wide bid on the far turn, took the lead at the
five-sixteenths, shook clear under urging at the quarter-pole and proved much the best under steady urging. COSTA TERRA dropped back along the rail
while under tight restraint on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, chased in the two path on the far turn and got up for the place. I AM THE LAW went
three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and weakened while able to
get the show. MIDNIGHT TROUBLE stalked the pace on the inside under a tight hold, made a bid along the rail with three furlongs to run, was urged along
passing the five-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner at the quarter-pole and tired. LITTLE DEMON was hustled to the front, showed the way in the two
path, was roused on the far turn, lost the lead near the five-sixteenths and capitulated. PORTOS went three to four wide on the turns, came five wide into
the stretch and failed to threaten. SYSTEMIC CHANGE went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the far turn and
failed to respond. FOWLER BLUE lost his footing slightly at the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path
on the far turn and was no factor. QUARTER-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE AND PROVIDED BY THE NYRA

Footnotes
WHITE CHOCOLATE was away alertly and crossed over to set the pace while racing in the two path, kicked away leaving the turn, then was kept to crop
urging to prove best. SECURITY CODE stalked the winner three wide, came four wide into the lane and was roused by the three sixteenths but proved to be
no match for the winner, second best. SWEETEST PRINCESS was well placed on the inside, was in the pocket by the quarter pole, tipped out three wide
but lacked the needed bid, bested rest. MONGOLIAN PANTHER chased the pace and was ridden along three wide on the turn but had no rally. VIENNA
CODE chased the early pace from the outside, four wide on the turn and weakened. MYTOWN MYRULES was settled early, three wide by the quarter pole
and had no response.

Footnotes
MAX FOSTER was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, shook off the
runner-up in upper stretch, responded well in the final furlong and held under steady urging. WAFLR tracked the pace, was asked three wide on the turn,
made a bid at the five-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished while able to hold the place. DUDLEY DICKERSON
bumped with a rival at the start, was ridden along towards the rear, raced inside to the three path on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and
improved for the show. NOBILIS bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, chased three then four wide on the turn and lacked the needed kick.
PERFECT OUTCOME settled towards the front, was urged along passing the five-eighths, went three wide on the turn and also lacked the needed kick.
ESCAPE KEY broke in at the start, was urged along off the pace, chased inside on the turn and lacked the needed response. ENGLISH STORM stumbled
at the start and was off slow, settled on the outside, went five wide on the turn and failed to respond. SINALOA dropped well behind, went three to four wide
on the turn and trailed then was eased in the stretch but walked off.
