pressure. SERENE WARRIOR showed good early speed from the inside and gave way grudgingly to the winner late in a game effort. KATY THE CAT

step slow, raced off the early pace setters, saved ground and raced evenly with no closing run. DAILY BRIEFING was off slowly, raced at the back of the
pack after the poor start, swung six wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.

ROO was off slowly, raced two to four wide around the far turn and raced even in the drive while racing from the far outside. MORNING THOUGHTS
tracked the early leader from the inside and faded. REDEEM EDDIE was shuffled back at the start and trailed.

Footnotes
SOCIALLY AWKWARD showed good early speed, met bid near the seven sixteenths pole, responded well to kick clear and held firm late under steady
handling. LOVE SHAQ stalked the pace, raced near the inside past the quarter pole, eased out and finished gamely to the wire. MAX BARLEY settled off
the early pace, raced four to five wide in the drive and moved up to improve position. KAZ CREED stalked the pace, made a three wide bid to challenge for
the lead near the five sixteenths pole and weakened through the drive. EAST AURORA was slow early on, saved ground and needed more in the drive.
MISSILEER tracked the pace from the inside and tired readily in the final stages.
