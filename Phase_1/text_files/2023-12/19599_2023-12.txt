Footnotes
AUTOLINE (IRE) settled inside, inched closer under coaxing on the far turn, swung out in upper stretch, rallied outside the top trio, took over at the sixteenth
pole and drove clear. CARIBBEAN KING stalked the pace along the rail, tipped out and bid between foes on the far turn, took a narrow lead outside the
eighth pole but was no match for the winner late. QUINTECENTS took control early and moved inside, led under light pressure from outer rival, cleared
NYQUILER on the far turn but was soon challenged by a pair of rivals, relinquished the lead in upper stretch, stayed on into deep stretch and faltered late.
GHOST COAST unhurried in the two path, advanced outside rivals on the backstretch, bid three deep at the quarter pole, battled to the sixteenth pole and
weakened late. SMOOTH SALUTE bumped with outer rival early then tracked two wide off the pace, went three deep into the far turn, four wide into the
stretch and could not rally. HARDMONEYMUCHACHOS broke a step slow, steered to the inside racing at the back, saved ground to the stretch and
improved position. PRAY FOR ME RAY bumped with SMOOTH SALUTE early, traveled near the back along the inside, went two then three wide on the far
turn and failed to menace. CHROME TO RICHES stalked in the two path, got shuffled back behind NYQUILER on the far turn, tipped out three wide, lacked
room entering the lane and was not persevered with late. NYQUILER broke alertly and raced outside leader while keenly in hand, applied pressure from
outside, lost touch with the leader with three furlongs remaining, got put in a bit tight between rivals near the five-sixteenths pole, dropped back between
runners and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
SOUL OF MIDNIGHT sprinted clear quickly, showed the way along the inside then two wide on the turn, asked right handed at the top of the lane when
feeling some pressure to the outside and responded nicely by turning that rival away and drawing off. MISTER BEAMS stalked the lone leader off the inside,
loomed two then three wide on the turn but flattened out in deep stretch. HOTROD RIDE bobbled slightly at the start, lacked early speed, saved ground
through the turn, then passed tired rivals to earn the show. EAGLES LANDING got brushed leaving the gate, chased four wide into the turn, five wide into
the lane and lacked the needed response. STAN FROM MALIBU broke out and brushed EAGLES LANDING, stalked the pacesetter outside a rival, traveled
three then four wide on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
MAN O ROSE sped clear and moved across to the inside, tested by GYPSY TEARS on the turn, responded to urging by cleared that rival at the eighth pole
and held gamely to the wire. EDDIE'S LAST chased two wide through the turn, moved out in upper stretch and finished willingly to gain the place. GYPSY
TEARS closest in pursuit in the early going, bid from outside at the five-sixteenths pole, could not sustain the challenge approaching the eight pole and got
outkicked for second. ANDY CAN U HEAR ME sat off the pace, rounded the bend two wide, moved out in the drive and lacked a rally. WINDING broke a
step slow, laid off the pace outside a rival, navigated the turn two then three wide and lacked a response when asked. SQUALOTORO settled inside off the
pace, saved ground through the bend, had the rider lose his whip entering the stretch and failed to menace. DOUBLE JAB hopped at the start, jumped onto
the dirt crossing, climbed up the backstretch, traveled along the inside then tipped two wide leaving the bend, was not persevered with in the final furlong,
eased late and walked off.

Footnotes
IRISH WAHINE established the front early, crossed to the inside, challenged by DANCING DANA on the turn, put away that foe in upper stretch and was
kept to task to the wire. WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE threw her head and reared at the start to spot the field several lengths, was guided out wide and inched
closer up the backstretch, continued to gain four wide outside rivals around the bend, chased within striking distance into the final furlong, could not find the
needed late kick to get to the winner but edged FLATTERWITHJEWELS for second. FLATTERWITHJEWELS forwardly placed in the early going, saved
ground through the turn, finished evenly in the furlong grounds and missed the place honors. DANCING DANA closest in pursuit from outside up the
backstretch, challenged around the turn, was no match for the winner in upper stretch and flattened to fourth. HOT ROD MAMA unhurried in the beginning,
saved ground on the inside then angled out into the stretch and was not a factor. ROMAN EMPRESS chased three wide into and around the turn, angled
out in upper stretch and weakened. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START OF WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE AND RULED THAT SHE CAUSED HER
OWN PROBLEMS AT THE START IS CONSIDERED A STARTER.

Footnotes
MEDORO chased three deep around both turns, drew alongside the leader midstretch, dueled in the final sixteenth and edged past late. CHATALAS stalked
from inside then shifted to the two path on the clubhouse turn, bid outside at the three-eighths pole, dueled into the stretch, took over with a furlong. MO
FOX GIVIN pulled two then three wide early, followed those same paths through the far turn, steered out in the lane, shifted in and bumped ZONA VERDE
(IRE) late and gained the show. ZONA VERDE (IRE) threw head head to come away slow and had the rider lose his left iron for a bit before regaining his
footing, saved ground at the back through the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, finished determinedly in the furlong grounds, took a bump from MO FOX
GIVIN late and got outfinished by that rival for third. ANTIFONA (FR) took a bump from inside at the start, pulled along the inside and steadied off heels into
the first turn, remained inside to the stretch, lacked room and checked in upper stretch, tipped out and finished willingly while bumping late. APRIL VINTAGE
sprinted clear from the far outside then crossed over to the fence, pressured from outside at the three-eighths pole, dueled into the lane holding a slim lead,
lost command approaching the eighth pole and weakened in the final sixteenth while taking a bump late. HIGHLANDS stalked in the two path, went three
wide into the far turn, roused around the bend, entered the stretch in the two path and flattened out. HATTIE T bumped outer rival leaving the gate, tracked
from inside, coaxed along on the far turn, put to right handed urging in the lane and got put in tight nearing the wire. BLUE OASIS tracked two wide off the
pace early, moved into range still in the two path on the second bend, steered out in the drive and weakened. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START
OF ZONA VERDE (IRE) AND RULED THAT SHE CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS AND WAS AWARDED A FAIR START. THERE WAS ALSO AN
INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN BETWEEN MO FOX GIVIN AND ZONA VERDE (IRE) AND RULED THAT ALTHOUGH MO FOX GIVIN DID
SHIFT IN AND MAKE CONTACT WITH ZONA VERDE (IRE) LATE IT DID NOT AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE RACE.

Footnotes
AMERICAREDWHITEBLU chased four then three wide early, came under a ride on the far turn, bothered by MATANZAS CREEK at the quarter pole, drew
alongside with a furlong left to run, dueled into deep stretch and dug in to edge the runner-up. MATANZAS CREEK pressed the pace from outside, took
over approaching the five-sixteenths pole, drifted out slightly to bother AMERICAREDWHITEBLU at the quarter pole, maintained command two wide into
the lane, challenged by AMERICAREDWHITEBLUE at the eighth pole and yielded grudgingly in the end. MISCHELOF (CHI) trailed early and moved inside,
passed tired rivals two wide on the second bend and was along for the show. CLOUSEAU set the pace along the inside under pressure from MATANZAS
CREEK, relinquished the lead on the far turn, chased after the top pair past the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. ORDER AND LAW tracked along
the three path on the clubhouse turn, saved ground on the second bend, came out in upper stretch and had little left for the furlong grounds. DE LA LUNA
bobbled leaving the gate, chased in the two path to the far turn, dropped back while easing out to the four path around the bend, eased in the lane and
walked off.

Footnotes
LORD BULLINGDON stalked on the rail through both turns, launched a rail bid in upper stretch, quickly took over past the eight pole and drew away
convincingly. CHARGE FOR GOLD took control early from inside, tested by MIRACLE MARK approaching the five-sixteenths pole, held a short lead in the
two path entering the lane, put away MIRACLE MARK nearing the eight pole but was then challenged immediately by LORD BULLINGDON to the inside,
failed to offer any resistance to that rival and stayed on to secure second. TWIRLING POINT tucked inside off the pace, saved ground while worked on
through the far turn, summoned a mild rally and gained the show honors. MIRACLE MARK move into the two path early while closest in pursuit of the lone
leader, challenged from outside midway around the far turn, fought three wide into the lane, could not sustain the challenge entering the final furlong and
flattened to fourth. FINAL BOSS tracked two wide around the clubhouse turn, between rivals on the backstretch, continued in the two path on the second
bend, angled out at the top of the stretch and failed to rally. AMERICAN HOPE became fractious behind the gate, pulled two then three wide chasing on the
first turn, moved into range outside rivals in the middle stages, driven three wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
KINZA dueled inside MS BO J up the backstretch, cleared early on the bend, challenged again by that rival at the quarter pole, shook free at the top of the
lane and widened under urging. SPLENDORA forwardly placed early, chased between foes leaving the backstretch, traveled two wide on the turn then
moved inside past the quarter pole, kept on willingly and bested the rest. MS BO J dueled outside KINZA to the turn, lost contact early on the bend and
chased for a bit before challenging again from outside at the quarter pole, was turned away once more by the winner at the top of the stretch and flattened
to third. WHERE'S MY RING lugged out early but was quickly corrected, raced along the rail into the turn, made light contact with outer rival at the
five-sixteenths pole, angled out with a quarter mile remaining, moved out further in the lane and showed a mild rally to earn a minor award. TAHINI tracked
off the inside, gained three then four wide on the turn but flattened in the furlong grounds. COASTAL COWGIRL chased three deep then four wide on the
turn and weakened. SHE'Z THE LAW got bumped from inside and lost her path at the start, raced outside a rival near the back three wide into the turn,
rounded the bend three deep, floated five wide into the stretch and could not rally. PETITE ANGE settled off the pace, traveled between runners in the two
path then came three wide into the lane and lacked further response. MOTET dropped back early, trailed five wide into the turn, angled in and cut the corner
entering the lane, moved back off the fence in the lane and was not a factor. CREATIVE QUALITY broke out and bumped, laid off the pace early, drifted on
the turn while losing ground and tired. TOULOUSE DETRAC chased along the inside into the turn, trying to get out late on the bend and was kept in by the
rider, then faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
GUY NAMED JOE bumped and had to take up early, steered to the inside near the back, went between foes on the backstretch, remained between on the
far turn then came three wide into the lane, moved out for a clear run, rallied outside the top pair and drove clear near the wire. LET SEAMUS GO away
quickly and vied three deep into the first turn, elected not to go on with the winner but instead shifted into the two path to give chase, challenged from
outside near the five-sixteenths pole, dueled into the lane, took over in upper stretch, fought to the sixteenth pole, could not match the winner late but
outkicked SHOT OF COURAGE for second. SHOT OF COURAGE vied between rivals into the clubhouse turn then cleared and moved inside around the
bend, showed the way up the backstretch, met the challenge from LET SEAMUS on the far turn, dueled into the lane, lost command in upper stretch, fought
back to the sixteenth pole and yielded late. ARIO moved to the inside racing at the back early, drew closer in the middle stages but still trailed into the far
turn, tipped two wide around the bend, moved out in the lane and summoned a mild rally to complete the superfecta. POTENTIAL SPAM chased off the rail
then moved inside early, tipped two wide late on the clubhouse turn, raced two wide then shifted to the three path briefly, steered back to the inside late on
the bend and could not produce a bid. GORILLA BOY broke a step slow, settled outside a rival at the back, moved out and inched closer up the backstretch,
gained four then five wide before angling down to the three path on the far turn but flattened out in the final furlong. CLASSIC ALPHIE broke a step slow
then bumped with outer rival early, chased from inside, started to weaken on the far turn and faded in the lane. NO SHOW JONES chased in the two path
then moved inside on the clubhouse turn, got shuffled back to the rear on the far turn, tipped two wide leaving that bend and weakened. EIGHT CLAP raced
outside a rival towards the rear early, went three deep into the far turn, got put in tight four wide at the five-sixteenths pole and weakened.
