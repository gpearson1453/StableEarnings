Footnotes
PURECRAZIGROOVE bumped with foes on both sides at the start, chased in the four path, was driven from the three path into the turn, swung out to the
six path turning into the stretch, switched leads just after the eighth pole, and rallied late to be up in the final strides. SIXTEEN CIGARETTES set the pace in
the three path, opened up while in the four path approaching the quarter, was driven into the stretch, held a clear lead into the final furlong, but began to
shorten stride around the sixteenth, and was caught in the final strides by an outer foe to place. DESIGNATED HITTER prompted the pace in the two path,
was ridden into the turn, and finished evenly from the three path down the lane for show. MACUTO bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace
in the six path, was driven in the four path around the turn, but made no impact from the seven path in the stretch. SLEIPNIR stalked inside but faded in the
stretch. BUILDER JAK bumped with foes on both sides at the start, rated in the five path, shifted into the two path early around the turn, but never menaced.
DECISIVE WARRIOR broke out and bumped an outer foe, then trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WHAT SAY THEE settled off the pace while racing two wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn, swung out in upper stretch and surged clear.
BOLD MAJESTIC broke through the starting gate prior to the start, raced in range two and three wide, bid between foes in midstretch but was no match for
the winner. HARRINGTON raced off the early pace four wide, lodged a four wide bid rounding the far turn, reached near even terms in midstretch and was
outkicked from there. ST. JOE LOUIS (GB) saved ground off the pace, steadied nearing the quarter pole, waited for room, angled out in upper stretch, was
bumped near the eighth pole and kept on to gain a minor share. JERRY'S TURN rated off the pace inside, swung seven wide in upper stretch, bumped with
ASK MY NAME near the eighth pole and improved position late. ASK IN MY NAME was very slow to begin, trailed inside, swung widest in upper stretch,
was bumped near the eighth pole and passed tiring rivals. STERLING HARMONY prompted the pace three wide, reached near even terms approaching the
quarter pole, vied to midstretch and weakened. PALACE VIEW (IRE) saved ground in range, was blocked through most of the stretch and not urged once
finally free in deep stretch. KING SILVIO settled off the early pace while racing three wide, bid four wide rounding the far turn, was checked near the eighth
pole and dropped back. TIZ THE COAST set the pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. FRISSON pressed the pace two wide
and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
OZONE set the pace in the two path, kicked away under rousing turning into the stretch, and continued to extend his advantage under a drive. SIR BANANA
BRIAN broke out at the start, stalked in the four path, was roused from the three path into the far turn, lost touch with the winner turning into the lane, but
chased on to hold place. IMAPEPPA travelled in range while being prompted along in the two path, tipped out under a drive around the turn, swung from the
six path into the stretch, and kept on for show. HERCULES N LOVE chased inside, had to check going into the turn, cut the corner under a drive turning into
the stretch, and finished evenly. SPIN THE BOULEVARD hit the gate leaving, rated in the three path, was ridden four wide around the turn, fanned out to
the seven path at the top of the lane, but did not factor. FIRST COAST STORM pressed the winner along the inside but faded from the three path in the
stretch. BOURBON WARRIOR tracked in the three path but backed up between foes leaving the turn.

PEJA DU set a clear pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. ARAK settled off the pace inside, advanced inside around the far turn, tipped out in
upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and could only slightly gain on the winner. EUPHORIA STAR saved ground off the pace and rallied
inside of foes to gain the show in the final strides. MISTER MOORE raced closest to the winner three wide and weakened in the lane. EYES OF
CHAMPION failed to menace while racing three wide. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE was outrun inside. MANNIX (IRE) raced in range two and three wide and faded
through the stretch. PLUMA ROJA chased the pace two and three wide and lacked a closing bid.

Footnotes
MARCEAU stalked in the three path, was nudged along in the two path around the far turn, angled to the rail turning into the lane, took the lead passing the
eighth pole, and dug in to hold off an outer pair. HALON raced up close in the five path, was roused while three wide passing the quarter, bumped with an
inner foe in the five path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. TOUR THE CITY bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the five path, ranged up in
the four path around the far turn, and kicked on down the stretch for show. HOMER JONES set the pace inside of foes from the two path, was roused along
the inside into the far turn, dug in from the two path into the stretch, but faded in the final furlong. AMAZING JETT pressed in the four path, bid in the two
path around the far turn, bumped with an outer foe while back in the four path in upper stretch, and flattened. NO PLEBEIAN was reluctant to load, raced in
midfield in the four path, tipped out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but made no impact. DARTH got bumped and pinched back at the start, raced
off the pace in the three path early but was no factor. NEVER SAY NEVER bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced in midpack in the two path but
weakened down the lane. STREET EARNINGS hopped at the start and bumped with an inner foe, raced wellback in the four path and never threatened.
ADMIRAL NIMITZ (GB) broke in and bumped an inner foe, trailed in the three path and was eased into the stretch.

Footnotes
SAND AND SEA set the pace in the three path, tipped to the two path and under confident handling around the far turn, was roused while back in the three
path approaching the eighth pole, and inched clear. JAN'S GIRL tracked in the two path, was roused while tipping out to the four path turning into the
stretch, and ran on for place. LADY ARSINOE chased in the three path, was coaxed in the four path midway around the far turn, swung from the six path
into the stretch, and kept on for show. IMPLOSION stalked in the four path, was cued in the three path midway around the far turn, floated out to the five
path turning into the lane, but flattened. MARIA'S REVENGE trailed in the two path, angled out to the five path and was coaxed into the far turn, fanned out
to the seven path at the top of the lane, but did not threaten. IN A SPIN raced off the pace inside, was coaxed from the rail passing the quarter, but
weakened in the stretch.

STONE SILENT settled off the pace outside, made progress four wide around the turn, moved to the front near the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a
drive. CHOOSE JOY trailed inside, angled three wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied between foes to gain the place.
TWILIGHT GLEAMING (IRE) broke well, was rated back three wide, remained in hand around the turn, tipped five wide in upper stretch and finished
willingly to just miss second. GLITTER UP disputed the pace in the three path to the sixteenth pole then weakened. LA TRAVIESA raced off the pace inside,
cut the corner into the lane to gain some posititon in upper stretch but was one-paced at the rail in the lane. TALKIN TIPSY raced off the pace 2wd, swung
widest in upper stretch and lacked a rally. LADY MILAGRO dueled inside a foe in the two path and faltered in the lane.

PANTHER ISLAND bumped with BAD BEAT BRIAN at the start, saved ground off the duel, tipped two wide in upper stretch, closed between foes and was
up late. EXTENDO bumped with COPPOLA at the start, dueled inside of that foe to deep stretch, won that battle but could not withstand the winner.
EAMONN lacked early speed, raced three wide around the turn, angled further out in upper stretch and rallied to gain the show in the final strides.
COPPOLA was bumped at the start, dueled two wide to deep stretch and weakened late. BIZ BIZ BUZZ saved ground off the pace and rallied belatedly
inside. BAD BEAT BRIAN was bumped at the start, raced three wide and went evenly. CLOUDY raced well back inside, swung out in upper stretch and
never threatend. YES I AM FREE pressed the pace three wide and tired in the drive.
