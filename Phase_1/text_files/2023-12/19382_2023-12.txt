Footnotes
SILVERBULLETTWENTY stalked the early pace, advanced three deep leaving the turn, secured command entering the stretch, was under urging in the
drive and drew off. KICK STARTNESS , up close early, swung four wide leaving the turn, had aim on the leader in mid stretch and flattened out. FORMAL
AFFAIR , four wide entering the stretch, worked between horses and passed tired ones. RESTLESS lacked speed, hugged the inner rail entering the turn,
eased out three wide leaving the bend and closed between foes. TIZAWINNER trailed to the stretch, was very wide on the turn and passed tired rivals.
AVES MAKIN' WAVES , along the inner rail on the turn, altered course to the outside in mid stretch and was no factor. SUMMERSTATEOFMIND saved
ground on the turn, chased the pace for a half mile, weakened and drifted out near the eighth pole. BURNINGUPTHEDOUGH set the early pace in the two
path, saved ground on the turn and retreated through the stretch. DOUBLE NICKEL showed speed along the inner rail and gave way after a half mile. SIN
PERMISO dropped back.

Footnotes
THE HAUNTED ROOM , away alertly and under some coaxing early, tracked the leaders three wide, bid three wide between rivals leaving the far turn,
sparred around the turn, emerged in a battle to the inside of LOVELY LIZA entering the lane, shifted closer to the rail near mid stretch, wrested a short lead
with about a sixteenth remaining and held firm under steady encouragement. LOVELY LIZA was steadied when in close soon after the break, regrouped
and rated off of a contested pace, moved up four wide and threatened between runners exiting the far turn, dueled between foes around the turn, gained a
slim advantage outside the winner in upper stretch, ceded command a sixteenth out then was kept at bay to the wire. THENCOMEMORNING gained the
early lead between runners leaving the chute, secured the inside soon after, was hounded by a quartet to her outside leaving the three eighths, gave willing
chase as the leaders got away past the three sixteenths then faded very late. GINGER GIRL dueled two wide between foes, failed to match strides nearing
the lane, angled out some and faded. SHINY SLAM , well placed off the five way battle mid turn, swung out in the lane and came up empty. TIMELY
SECRET bid five deep into the turn, forced the issue outside runners to about the quarter pole and tired. STRATEGY QUEEN broke a step slow and was
outrun.

GREAT OPPORTUNITY rushed up early to put a head in front mid way down the backstretch, hugged the rail disputing a fast pace, edged clear entering
the stretch then eagerly increased his advantage under brisk urging. ALBERT FINNIGAN , rated back soon after the break, saved ground on the turn,
remained along the inner rail in the stretch and passed tired rivals to gain the place. HOYA lacked speed, was kept wide throughout and passed tired
horses. NEIL TO THE KING disputed the pace outside the winner and weakened late. GRUMPY GRIN , along the inner rail mid way on the turn, eased out
for the drive, angled to the six path in mid stretch and passed tired foes. EL DIVINO NINO chased the pace while well off the inner rail on the turn and gave
way. ALWAYS FUN raced in the two path on the turn and retreated through the stretch. SAISIR LE JOUR was outrun. GOODBYE NOTE stalked the duel,
drifted wide entering the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
ACE NINE NINE , away in good order, secured a stalking spot along the rail early on, wax under coaxing to hold position past the half mile marker, eased
out leaving the five sixteenths, moved up outside WHAT SAY YOU soon after, forged to command entering the lane, opened up under a strong drive and
was kept alert to very late. GALATIANS settled off the pace, saved ground into the far turn, was stalled nearing the three eighths, remained inside into and
through the lane and finished up willingly to gain the place. WHAT SAY YOU cleared early, set a rated pace towards the rail, failed to resist the winner into
the lane, stayed on past mid stretch, drifted out late and weakened. BRASSTOWN , between rivals early, stalked the pace two wide leaving the far turn,
failed to go on with the leaders entering the lane, faded leaving the eighth pole and had his rider lose the whip with about seventy yards remaining. WALK
AWAY JOE lagged back, swung five to six wide for the drive and failed to menace. UP AGAINST IT , four wide to contention, dropped in a path near the
seven eighths and tracked, failed to respond leaving the three eighths and gave way. CLAW , a bit rank leaving the gate, raced in range two wide into the far
turn then faltered. BAHAMA CHANNEL , four wide, faltered around the final turn and was eased through the lane.

BIGDADDYSBOY , three deep around the turn, chased the pace, drew alongside LE VIN in mid stretch and prevailed in an extended drive. LE VIN showed
speed in the two path between horses around the turn, battled through the lane while on his left lead and just wasn't quite good enough. LITTLE LANCE
disputed the pace racing along the inner rail and faded late. PACO THE TACO MAN stalked the duel, eased out four wide leaving the turn and gave way.
JUMPINGJAGGERFLASH broke last, was lightly steadied in close quarters along the inner rail leaving the backstretch then gave way. PER RULING
#24-005 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, LE VIN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
HONEY B B vied outside DETERMINED BLUE, took over around the turn, briefly went clear near mid stretch, was re engaged from her inside by that one
near the sixteenth marker, dueled under right handed asks while on her left lead and got the bob. DETERMINED BLUE sparred inside the winner, found
more past the eighth pole and battled back towards the inside to be on near even terms, appeared to take a slim lead in deep stretch, fought gamely but lost
the bob. SUN STREAMING saved ground off the embattled leaders, moved up into the lane, eased out a bit to continue pursuit and churned on to slowly
gain. SKIP THRU DA FIRE broke outward and bumped with a rival, corrected and chased to the inside of SWEET SUMMER LOVE, angled four wide into
the lane, loomed a bit past mid stretch but failed to seriously kick on. R B'S BIG MOMENT , three deep early, angled six wide for the drive and offered a
slight response. COLLECTED SUCCESS , between foes heading to the turn, chased off the rail and lacked a solid run. CUNDI , off the pace while saving
ground, failed to menace. MARTHA'S HEART , well back around the turn while between rivals, failed to menace. SIPPIN' TIME failed to menace. EL
DORADO QUEEN lacked speed, raced three deep leaving the far turn and failed to generate a response. SWEET SUMMER LOVE , bumped at the break,
chased outside SKIP THRU DA FIRE, was fanned five wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
YOUR ANALYSIS raced in mid pack down the backstretch, briefly steadied in traffic near the three eighths pole, left the turn in the two path, eased outside
horses approaching the eighth pole, closed determinedly and was up late. RHUMJAR , three wide the first turn, chased the pace outside horses down the
backstretch, moved up two wide on the far turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. LAMARVELOUS , three wide the first turn,
circled the far turn three wide, floated four wide turning for home and finished willingly. JARDANI trailed to the stretch, swung widest in upper stretch and
passed tired horses. GREAT HEAVENS showed speed, hugged the inner rail around the far turn and tired the final furlong. DOLICE VITA showed speed
along the inner rail and gave way on the far turn. FRIGHTLAND , steadied at the break, steadied on heels on the first turn was never a factor.

Footnotes
SHINELIKEADIAMOND sped clear early, set a rated pace towards the rail, dug in when confronted in mid stretch, dueled to the inside of ANGEL ART, kept
on tenaciously under left handed asks and got the bob. ANGEL ART , under rating inside, edged up into the turn, eased out with momentum into the lane,
drew alongside the winner in mid stretch, battled head to head through the final sixteenth and just missed. CHICKAHOMINY settled off the pace, crept
closer past the five sixteenths, swung out to be six wide in upper stretch and closed willingly. DEEDS OF LOVE , two wide between rivals stalking the pace,
drafted back a bit leaving the five sixteenths, shifted in, edged up past mid stretch and continued on with some effort. CYNERGY'S ELECTRA , four deep
pursuing the pace, was under pressure into the lane and came up empty. GENIEINABRIDLE , three wide between rivals, was ridden along mid turn and
faded. ANGELOFCANTERBURY , three wide outside the winner, failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
THE BIG ENCHILADA sprinted to a clear early lead, saved ground around the turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, was kept to his business in the drive.
INFINITE SERIES , a forward factor in the two path around the turn, chased the winner in a game effort. THE LAST JUMPSTART lacked speed, swung to
the five path at the head of the stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. BOX OF ROCKETS , a bit green behind horses mid way down the
backstretch, raced inside foes on the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and passed tired foes. MO MONEY MO BETTA , three wide chasing the
pace around the turn, gave way in the drive. CHEATIN SONG , well placed on the turn, swung four wide approaching the stretch and gave way. ARMY
RANGER , outrun while three wide on the turn, swung farther out in upper stretch. FIRE AND KNIVES showed some early foot along the inner rail, was
shuffled back entering the turn and retreated through the stretch.
