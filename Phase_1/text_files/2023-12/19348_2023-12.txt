Footnotes
C C'S LEGACY was roused to be off the pace on the inside then was asked near the five sixteenths pole, maneuvered around horses going three wide on
the turn, engaged the leader at the top of the stretch, dueled down the stretch and prevailed. CABOCHON TREASURE pressed the pace from three wide on
the backstretch then took the lead at the quarter pole but was engaged at the eighth pole and dueled down the stretch while fighting gamely. FRIEND'S DO
CARE sprinted to a pressured lead from between horses on the backstretch then was headed at the quarter pole, matched strides with outside rival to the
top of the stretch but weakened and stayed on for the show. SUNSET WAR vied for the lead from the inside to the top of the stretch but lacked the late
response. DIRECTIONAL raced in the middle of the pack on the backstretch then moved up from three wide on the turn to make a late run and was best of
the others. ROLL ON OUT raced in the middle of the pack showing even effort. WICKED TOUGH saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack but
never made a bid. D W STRONG had no early speed and was not a threat. BIG RUSSSS was forwardly placed to the top of the stretch and gave way.
BORDEAUX RED remained back.

HEZA PICKLE was unhurried around the first turn then moved up from five wide on the backstretch and engaged the leader near the five sixteenths pole
and drove past to win going away. SARAH'S VISION raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved up to engage the leader from two
wide at the five sixteenths pole but was no match for HEZA PICKLE but proved second best. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST was allowed to settle around the first
turn then steadily advanced down the backstretch, moved out to three or four wide into the stretch for the late rally. MIND ON MY MONEY raced off the
pace to the final turn while racing evenly then fell back slightly but made a mild bid and passed tiring rival. J C'S IN TOWN pressed the pace through the first
turn then took the lead entering the backstretch and held that position to the final turn and gave way. JOEBOY was forwardly placed to the first turn then
raced four wide on the backstretch but never made a serious bid. SABER STORM sprint to a brief early lead to the first turn then vied for the lead to the
three furlong marker and dropped back. NOW NOW MAN was through after a half.

JOLLY TOMMY stalked the pace from off the rail then made a three wide bid on the final turn to drive past the leader to prov ebest. DAVIDIC LINE hustled
to the lead and edged away on the backstretch but was overtaken at the top of the stretch and was a game second. GOLDEN QUALITY vied for the lead
from three wide around the first turn then settled off the pace down the backstretch but lacked a late response and was no match for the top two. ONCE
UPON A DREAM was allowed to settle while saving ground made a milde bid into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. RUNTODAY had an unprepared start
spotting the field several lengths leaving the gate and remained back, was declared a non-starter. PAYNT BATTLE prompted the pace from two wide down
the backstretch and gave way. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS POSTED INTO THE START OF THE RACE, AFTER A REVIEW IT WAS DETERMINED
THAT RUNTODAY HAD AN UNFAIR START AND WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER.

REINA ACES stalked the pace from three wide down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the turn to take the lead and held off the late closing
rivals. GOTTEMINABIND raced in the middle of the pack on the inside down the backstretch, moved up on the turn while tipping out to four wide in upper
stretch for a late effort in the stretch drive but was too late. LITTLE Z raced in the middle of the pack from the two path down the backstretch, moved up on
the turn while tipping out to five wide in the stretch to make a rally but was not enough. PAYTON'S INDIAN saved ground while being forwardly placed
through the final turn, moved between horses in mid stretch but was empty. CAT B CAUSE was allowed to settle at the back through the final turn and made
a mid track rally. ZIPPING MOLLY pressed the pace from two wide around the first turn then shared command down the backstretch while edging away into
the turn for a brief lead and was overtaken in short order and tired in the stretch. JULIO CHOICE was always back. SWEET STORMY ELLE hustled to a
pressured lead around the first turn then shared command down the backstretch then slowly faded on the turn and dropped back in the stretch.
