Footnotes
HIGHLY CREATIVE pressed the issue off the inside, put a head in front into the lane, dueled to the wire inside the runner up, dug in late to narrowly prevail.
MY CAJUN LADY stalked the two leaders toward the inside, angled out three wide and advanced to challenge the top pair three wide turning for home,
dueled outside the winner to the wire, outkicked. SHE BE SHEEHAN broke alertly, narrowly set the pace inside, continued to show the way under pressure
the middle half, could not match the top two in the drive, saved the show. TEXAS TWINKIES lacked early foot, improved position off the inside, gaining
steadily for the show. BYZANTINE fell back to trail after the start, continued back, passed some tiring rivals while not menacing. CUPID'S MUSIC settled off
the pace outside, had little left for the drive. MINNIE'S READY was finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
ZAP MOTION away in good order, showed the way into and through the first turn along the inside, set a lively set of early fractions, disposed of the other
speed in the far turn, stayed clear through the lane while being kept to pressure. BEN DREAMING settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer four
wide through the second turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, could do little with that rival to the wire, clearly second best. SIR also settled
behind first flight while saving ground, 2p into lane, outkicked for the place down the stretch, lasted for the show. AIN'T THAT A KICK off a step slow, raced
back, continued to trail backstretch, three to four wide second turn, staged a mild rally to improve position. PHILHARMONIC pressured the issue up front
while three wide, weakened. STAR NATION broke back and was never a threat. RUNNINGFORCASH pressed the issue from the two path and between
horses, began to retreat far turn, continued to fade. HUMOR ME NOW five wide into the first turn, raced in midpack for six furlongs and began to tire.
ASSUMPTION was done before a half, finished far back.

Footnotes
GOING THE DISTANCE broke sharply, set the pace up the backstretch and into the turn in the two path, pulled away steadily down the lane, ridden out.
POPPERINA off a step slow, dropped inside into the turn, advanced then steered off the rail late in the turn, closest entering the stretch, no match for the
winner, well clear of the others. UNION DAME forwardly placed along the inside, moved closer by late in the turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive
to flatten out. LEGALLY LUCKY lacked speed outside, raced four wide into the turn, in the two path exiting, lacked a closing kick. TRUE EMOTION in mid
pack early off the inside, four wide entering the stretch, came up empty for the drive. BODI ODI chased the winner early, gave way in the turn, finished well
back.

Footnotes
OH MY GAWD dueled up front in the early going off the inside, shook off the other speed late in the turn, firmly roused when straightened for home, not
threatened to the wire under continued steady handling. ACCELERATING BABE broke out and was rank at the break, lacked speed inside, came in the two
path for the drive, finished willingly to be up for the place. ADIVA chased the dueling leaders early inside, moved out to be three wide turning for home,
closest to the winner a furlong out, caught for second. CALLIN FOR DOLLARS cut off to be off slowly at the break, raced back and outside, four wide
through the turn, improved position a bit while not a serious threat. SMOKIN MOTION off the pace and the inside, four wide exiting the turn, lacked a closing
kick. GRACEFUL MOON void of speed, saved ground through the turn, failed to threaten. KAMIKAZE BLUE dueled up front along the inside, gave way.
CANDY COOP fell back to trail after the start and was always outrun.

Footnotes
SUMMER IN MALIBU last to leave, lacked early foot, made a good gain four to five wide midway on the turn, continued to advance to challenge outside the
late leader, up in the final strides to show good determination. OLLIEMEISTER broke on top, narrowly set the pace outside, gained a larger advantage past
the furlong marker, could not contain the winner. A LA CARTE moved closer in some traffic along the rail with a half mile to run, fell back, came again while
continuing along the inside. BOAT SONG broke back, moved up in the two path before a quarter, steadied in some traffic, fell back, moved out to be five
wide for the drive, improved position. HUNTSVILLE forwardly placed while between horses, shuffled back a bit late backstretch, moved closer before a half
off the inside, flattened out in the drive. KINGDOM a pace factor along the inside, dueled with the runner up, began to falter turning for home. RAVEN'S
NEST in the second three wide and between horses, had nothing for the drive. FAN THE FIRE tired while racing four wide. PASS LINE fell back to trail after
the start, was always outrun.

Footnotes
LAT LONG forwardly placed early off the inside, moved closer after a quarter, took over second turn, cleared, responded when the runner up came closer
late edged away again. COMMON DEFENSE prompted the pace three wide first turn, fell back middle half, four wide into the lane, closer inside the furlong
marker, no late gain, clear 2nd. LEFT TACKLE settled off the pace and the inside, steered out when straightened for home, rallied for the show, not a threat
to the top two. GIVE ME A REASON broke in, four wide through the first turn, fell back, advanced into the stretch, lugged in upper stretch to bother
MASMAK, finished up evenly when straightened. MASMAK back off the pace inside, put in tight, checked up in upper stretch, flat late. GENO'S MYTH void
of speed, made little impact. NO JUDGMENT bothered to be off slowly, remained back. JUSTIFIABLY SO moved up to set the pace, showed the way until
headed in the second turn, gave way, FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF MASMAK AGAINST GIVE ME A REASON FOR
INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED FIFTH.

Footnotes
EFFICIENCY last away, back off the pace and the inside, rallied three wide out of the turn, finished up with good resolve to challenge and gain command
inside the furlong marker, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. MALIBU S S back off the pace and the inside, steadily advanced through the turn, four
wide into the stretch, finished well to be getting to the runner up safe late. SHACKS WAY broke alertly, dueled up front in the two path, disposed of the other
speed when straightened for home, could not last. GOLD BARON in the second fight off the inside, three wide through the turn while remaining within
striking distance, lacked a closing kick. MARVELOUS THUNDER in mid pack, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, improved position slightly without
posing a serious threat. GOOD SCOUT reluctant to load, broke well, dueled up front closest to the inside, first to blink. HOLDING PATTERN fell back to trail
after the start, continued to see everyone through the turn, picked off some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. UNDER THE GUN headed up the
second flight in the two path, back up through the stretch. EASY BIG BOY remained back in failing to threaten. CITRUS BAY tired while racing just off the
inside. DEL MOON staged a steady retreat along the inside. BELLA'S PRAYER was always outrun while racing four wide.

Footnotes
DIVINE GAL back off the pace and the inside, in traffic early in the turn, angled out four wide exiting the bend, closed with good resolve to be up at the wire
on the outside. EDISTRUDIS vied early while between horses, fell back off the lead pair in the turn, roused for the drive, came back to challenge late and
was also going well at the end. READY FOR TROUBLE last away, trailed for three furlongs, altered course around a tiring rival four wide exiting the turn,
finished well while widest. SARATOGA SECRET back off the pace inside, moved out a bit in traffic through the turn, lodged a mild bid late, not enough.
XTREME DIVA forwardly placed, moved up to vie three wide into the turn, shook briefly clear a furlong out, faltered late to lose several positions. CHEEKY
GAL with the pace along the inside, weakened. ILLUSIVE STAR in mid pack while racing three wide, lacked a closing kick. COASTAL INVASION went one
paced while racing toward the inside. TORTUGA ISLAND broke back, was not a threat while four down to three wide turn. FEISTY MITOLE back off pace,
checked up midway on the turn, fell far back.

Footnotes
WINNEMAC AVENUE in the second flight while just off the inside, angled out four wide exiting the final turn, bid, kicked clear. CAN'T HUSH THIS dueled up
front off the inside, put a head in front a furlong out, gave ground grudgingly to the winner. O P FIRECRACKER settled off the pace while inside, continued
to save ground second turn, mild rally up the rail to annex the show. J J'S JOKER dueled up front along the inside, continued to do battle through upper
stretch, weakened final furlong. ELUSIVE TARGET in mid pack outside, four wide through the first turn, five wide through the second when moving up a bit,
flattened out through the lane. TEN DAYS LATER void of speed, four to five wide through the second turn, improved into the lane then also failed to sustain
that advance the final furlong. TEJAS went one paced in failing to threaten. HARLEEZY pulled early when off the pace, continued mid pack, four wide into
the stretch, failed to respond. NAMESAKE off a step slow, raced back, passed tiring rivals. RIGHT TONE remained back and was not a factor. DINNER AT
CRUMPIES in the second flight for a half, tired from those early efforts. BIZZY LEGS hesitated at the break, improved a bit far turn while off the inside, gave
way in the drive.

Footnotes
BLACK APPLE settled off the pace toward the inside early, steered out four wide when advancing late in the final turn, outside bid nearing the furlong
marker, held sway late. READY SHOES lacked speed, four wide into the stretch, staged a late rally to be getting to the winner late, well clear for the place.
AFLEET SKY lacked speed in the three path, continued three wide through the second turn, staged a mild rally to be up for the show. JIM NED void of
speed off the inside, three to four wide through the second turn, improved position through the stretch when also displaying some mild interest. TOPF ROAD
RULES broke well, alternated up front closest to the inside, got clear in the second turn, briefly responded when challenged in midstretch then faltered.
CHOCTAW ZIP in tight start, mid pack, four wide turning for home, came up empty for the drive. HAMAZING WISDOM off a step slow, trailed, improved
position with some mild late interest. TABLE MONEY within striking distance three wide, had nothing left for the drive. COURTNEY FAY settled in mid pack
while just off the inside, lacked rally. JACKS SPRING BREAK was finished early. CLASSY SOCKS away in good order dueled up front off the inside,
