Footnotes
INSENSITIVE settled in the second flight three wide, remained within striking distance on the outside up the backstretch, ranged up outside the winner to
challenge midway on the final turn, kicked clear into the lane, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under steady handling. QUEEN CLANCY
broke well, showed the way into the first turn along the inside, rated through some soft intermediate fractions, offered little resistance to the winner when that
one came alongside second turn, remained comfortably clear for the second spot. K'ANTHEIA pressured the runner up from the two path, bit closer
between that one and the winner late in the final turn then came up empty for the stretch run. HAPPY HAPPY off a step slow, second group in the two path
and between foes, failed to muster a rally in the lane. HAMO also broke a step slow, saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
SMOKIN' HOT broke alertly, narrowly set the pace while between rivals for a half, shook clear of the other speed into the stretch, continued to hold a
daylight advantage past the furlong marker, drifted late, narrowly held the nod over the runner up at the wire. HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT back off the pace
and the inside, ranged up closer in the four path by late in the turn, lost some ground to the leader into the stretch, got back to that one late, narrowly
missed. RACKATAPTAP in mid pack and outside early, four wide through the turn, mild advance into the stretch, angled in late, finished up willingly late to
be in time for the show. MISTER SHARPIE with the pace three wide, continued to vie through the turn, weakened steadily through the lane, lost the show
late. INVARIABLY one paced off the inside up the backstretch, four wide into the lane, improved a bit with some mild late interest. GALACTIC EMPIRE off a
step slow, raced back early as a result, was five wide into the stretch, also improved position. WARHORSE WEST broke back, lacked early speed, staged a
mild rally three wide while not a serious threat. BLACK STORM lacked early foot, failed to mount a significant response. SQUARE DEAL in the main body
early while just off the inside, tired. MORNING SNOW remained back while racing toward the inside. WHOOPING JAY with the pace for a half along the
inside, gave way. AWESOME FAMILY was also finished after four furlongs.

TABLE MONEY moved up to contest the pace just off the inside, continued to vie into the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, not threatened to
the wire. STREET COMMANDER back off the pace while racing outside, closer four wide through late turn, stalled a bit in upper stretch then came late for
the runner up spot while not a threat to the winner. FORSAKEN with the pace while racing outside, weakened from between horses through the stretch.
COLONEL BARTON pressed the issue from the three path for a half, drifted in a bit to steady slightly as FORSAKEN was drifting out slightly in midstretch,
had little left late. PARTYINTHESTREETS went one paced while just off the inside behind the first flight. KINFOLK settled in mid pack while three wide,
lacked a closing kick. HOWL YEAH pushed in at the break, lacked speed, three wide into the lane, displayed some mild late interest to improve position.
WATER TO WINE broke back, made little impact. WHONEW failed to menace while racing three wide. MR. WULLY BULLY remained back in also lacking a
closing rally. POINT BLANK tired while racing three out to four wide through the turn. MR. COUGAR bothered to be off slowly, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
I'M AN OAK broke out, raced in the second flight while between foes, moved out a bit when set down for the drive, finished with good resolve to hold fast
late. MR. BENNY broke on top, raced with the pace along the inside, put a head front nearing the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end. YEAGERS
STRATEGY back off the pace the inside, encountered some traffic in the two path early in the turn, steadied slight, traffic again late in the bend, went evenly
when clear for the drive. CHEZ WHIZ void of speed off the inside, rallied three wide to improve position late. ABBY'S ENCORE back off the pace off the
inside, three wide in the second flight into the turn, came four wide for the drive, also displayed some mild late interest. STREAKIN DEACON contested the
pace while between rivals for a half and began to weaken. SOUTHFORK off a step slow, fanned five wide into the stretch, picked off a couple of tiring rivals
while not a serious threat. REVEILLE VALLEY headed up the second flight along the inside for a half, faltered in the drive. COOL AND CLOUDY remained
back in failing to menace. HELLO MR COPELAND moved up to press the issue up front for a half three wide, gave way. IT'S A RAINY DAY broke back and
trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
IZEONPOINT off a step slow, raced back and inside, began to advance late in the turn, steered out a bit and finished with good energy to be up at wire.
DISTORTED SECRETS behind the pace toward the inside, two path into lane, came out in upper stretch to bother SCARLET POSITION in upper stretch,
challenged late on the outside, outkicked by the winner in the late going while outside that one at the wire. AWESOME BIRDIE came out in the early going
to carry out DIXIE PENNY, got clear, showed the way through the turn in the two path, gave ground grudgingly to the top pair while between them at the
wire. MIA BABY chased the leader, weakened. DIXIE PENNY carried out early, settled in the second flight, lacked a serious closing response. SCARLET
POSITION in the second flight, bothered upper stretch, finished up evenly. SPOILED ROTTEN off a step slow, raced back, saved ground, improved slightly.
GIMME CANDY failed to menace. COST A FORTUNE tired while three wide. MISS WINDY SLEW broke in, fell back, no menace. HAYTHERE
JOGEEGIRL settled in mid pack early, faded. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF SCARLET POSITION AGAINST DISTORTED
SECRETS FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SIXTH.

LUCKY BOSS forwardly placed along the inside, continued to save ground into far turn, rail bid, drifted out late, narrowly gained the nod.
PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE with the pace off the inside, vied three wide and between foes second turn, missed late. TEN DAYS LATER lacked speed,
advanced into a striking position outside far turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, no match top two late. CATDADDY set the pace off the inside, continued
to show the way in the two path, weakened in the drive. INEXORABLE off a bit slow, raced back, improved while not a serious threat. HOLLYWOOD
ENDING traffic in the first turn, made little impact. MOTOWN MUSIC pulled early while racing back off the pace, failed to rally. BIG HAT WILLIE off a step
slow, four wide through the first turn when with the second flight, had little left for the drive. AFFABLE MONARCH finished early while five wide into the
stretch.

Footnotes
RADICAL RIGHT forwardly placed up the backstretch toward the inside, shuffled back to lose position in the turn, challenged up the rail past the furlong
marker, proved best in game fashion late. BRESLAU took command soon after the start to set the pace, headed when straightened for home, could not
match the winner while outside that one late, came back to annex the place. TOP GUNNER pressed the pace up the backstretch outside, vied three wide
through the turn, put a head in front nearing midstretch only to weaken in the late going. MAC DADDY TOO off a bit slow, raced back early, circled into
contention four wide through the turn, flattened out. PRISONER pressed the issue early, vied between foes through the turn, gave way in the drive.
CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK went one paced in the three path, behind horses into the lane, lacked kick. IGNITIS saved ground to no avail. LEAGUE OF
LEGENDS remained always back. FLAGS UP trailed to be always outrun.

Footnotes
JACKMAN pressed the early leader from the outside, took over late in the turn, clear past the furlong marker, held runner up safe late. LAKE RADIO in the
second group while off the inside, set down behind the winner into the stretch, slowly getting to that one late while edging clear for the place. VULCAN away
in good order, narrowly set the pace just off the inside, relinquished the advantage to the winner late n the turn, gradually weakened stretch, saved the
show. BLUE KENTUCKY lacked speed off the inside, four to five wide turning for home, rallied midtrack, missed the show. ROB THE RICH moved closer
outside and four wide through the turn, flattened out in the drive. BEER CHASER last away, back, angled four wide late turn, showed some belated interest
to improve position. MACRON back off the pace, moved inside, saved ground through much of the turn, in some traffic in the two path into the stretch,
improved upper stretch then flattened out. ST ANDREWS void of speed, failed to menace. JOE FRAZIER tired while r4acinf four wide into the stretch.
DEFLATER forwardly placed along the inside, tired through the lane. SLAM DUNK SERMON mid pack, gave way late turn.

Footnotes
UNINVITED GUEST close from the start, took over turning for home, wore down the early leader past the furlong marker, held sway late under firm
handling. TAHOE RUN a bit rank in the first turn when well off the pace, advance in the three path through the second turn, finished willingly to be up for the
place. GREENER PASTURES broke alertly, set the pace toward the inside, raced on equal terms with the winner into the lane, proved stubborn until late in
losing the place. TAPSASIONAL within striking distance along the inside, lacked a closing punch in the drive. HEROIC MOVE lacked speed while angling in
a bit first turn, moved slightly closer while four wide through the second bend, failed to sustain that modest advance through the lane. WINTERS LION four
wide into the first turn, again late in the second bend, also lacked a closing response. CREATIVE MINISTER off a step through, remained back in failing to
threaten. CYCLONE fell back after the start and was never a threat. CHAPEL BARN forwardly placed while four wide through the first turn, maintained
contact with the lead pack up the backstretch then tired while three wide through the final turn. BACKSIDE BUZZ broke back and was not a factor. MANTA
REY was always outrun.

Footnotes
WINDY BAY forwardly placed toward the inside, firmly in hand behind the leaders up the backstretch, continued to be patiently handled second turn, let
loose for the drive, split foes late and finished well to win going away. SICILIAN GRANDMA prompted the leader off the inside, took over into the stretch,
proved no match for the winner late, all out to save the place. LET'S DUET void of speed, continued back and in the two path final turn, rallied late inside of
most traffic, getting to runner up. JUBELLA within striking distance off the inside, came three wide and still in position to fire into the lane, lacked that closing
punch. MAKEMEBELIEVE went one paced while racing in the second flight. GHAALEB'S RANGER also turned in an even effort from the second group
while off the inside. BRITTLE AND YOO lacked a rally while racing outside. H. T. XENA settled in mid pack and outside, continued four wide second turn,
failed to rally. RED RIVER MAGIC broke on top, set the pace, gave way when headed by the runner up into the stretch. C. C. HARBOR off a step slow,
remained always back. MIDNIGHTCANDYSTORM was finished after a half while racing toward the inside. ALSANAH lacked speed, backed up further
through the lane.
