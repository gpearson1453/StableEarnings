Footnotes
REMEMBER THE NAME was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path on the turn, gained the lead
nearing the five-sixteenths, was headed by the runner-up at the quarter-pole, dueled gamely inside that foe into the final sixteenth then regained the
advantage and narrowly prevailed under strong handling. LASER SHARP broke a half-step slow, was coaxed along on the outside, gained four wide on the
turn, took the lead in the three path at the quarter-pole, lugged in while dueling outside the winner in the stretch, was corrected multiple times with tugs of
the right rein, lost the advantage in the final sixteenth and just missed while well clear for the place. DON VINO VICI broke a step slow then bobbled, was
urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed response while up for the show. GAME MISCONDUCT chased the pace, went
three wide on the turn, floated five wide into the stretch and tired. THUNDERSLAM was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, raced behind a
foe in the two path early on the turn, shifted to the three path late on that bend, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. PAPPOU'S LAUGH
was hustled to the front, showed the way under heavy pressure to his inside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead nearing the five-sixteenths and
stopped.

Footnotes
SAINT EROS GIRL was soon clear and set the early pace off the inside, dropped to near the rail into the turn and widened the advantage, then was roused
left handed with the crop by the furlong marker and remained well clear, then was hand ridden the final sixteenth to prove much the best. BEHIND THE
COUCH was settled early four wide, advanced four wide on the turn, then finished willingly while no match to the winner while clearly second best.
CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE was reserved early, four wide on the turn, angled out leaving the three sixteenths to the far outside to have a belated rally to
best the rest. BEAUTIFUL KAREN chased the early pace on the outside, then was four to three wide on the turn and weakened in the drive. MIDTOWN
ROSE was away alertly to chased the early pace three wide, then dropped to be two wide entering the turn, then eased out on the turn and came six wide
off the turn and was empty. TOWERING GAZE hit the gate at the start, settled back and was on the inside on the turn, came three wide into the lane and
was no threat. LEFT LEANING LUCY tracked the early pace three to two wide, then dropped to the inside on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
BERNIETAKESCHARGE chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, moved closer to the three path at the quarter-pole, gained to take the
lead at the eighth-pole, fought outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. P MUTTER PICKLE was bumped in the
hindquarters at the start then hustled, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths,
lost the advantage to the winner at the eighth-pole, fought with that foe in the final furlong and missed while clear for the place. UNICORN CAKE was urged
along in fourth position, ranged up in the two path on the turn, drafted behind the leaders late on that bend, was asked at the quarter-pole, raced behind
horses into upper stretch, altered out near the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. VALENTINE GIFT bumped hard with
an opponent at the start then was taken up, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged along near the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten.
ALLEY'S SONG veered in at the start and bumped hard with a foe then dropped back, was urged along at the rear, went three wide on the turn, came four
wide into the stretch, remained on her inside lead in the drive and was no factor. CONCERTI was sent hard to the front, set the pace under pressure to her
outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths and faded.

ICY REPLY was bumped at the start, rated behind the vying leaders three wide on the turn, tipped out six wide leaving the turn and made a bid to hit the
front in the furlong grounds and draw clear to prove best under crop urging. SHE'S AWESOME stalked the early pace on the outside, then went up to vie for
command on the turn and made a four wide bid off the turn to shake clear then was headed inside the furlong marker and could not go with the winner while
staying on for the place award. ROMAN GODDESS was well rated on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and finished willingly but had no
punch, bested rest. MY GIRL JAL was allowed to settle early, three to four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the lane and had no rally. RED PEPPER
GRILL was reserved early on the inside, saved ground on the turn, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally. QUEENS OVER THREES dueled for the
early lead on the inside, then vied for the lead to the inside of two rivals while in the two path, then weakened in the drive. SHAMAN PRINCESS dueled for
the early lead three wide, then vied for the lead in between rivals on the turn to the quarter pole, then weakened.

near the five-sixteenths, rallied to make a rail bid into upper stretch, came out while taking a short lead outside the furlong marker, fought with
EVERYONELOVESLINDA into the final sixteenth then moved clear under steady handling. TO A T was bumped on both sides at the start then pinched
back, spotted the front many lengths, moved in while urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, gained
into the final furlong and finished with good energy to get the place. EVERYONELOVESLINDA was hustled from the gate, disputed the pace on the outside
then in the three path on the turn, battled with the winner under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the show. SHESALITTLE
EDGY chased the pace from third, went four wide on the turn and lacked the needed kick. SOLIB was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the
inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. TIMED OUT broke in and bumped with an opponent, was urged
along on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn, dropped to the three path near the quarter-pole and failed to rally. I'M BUZZY was bumped at the
start then squeezed back in tight quarters, spotted the front many lengths, moved in while urged along towards the back, shifted from the rail to the two path
on the turn and was no factor.

AIN'T BROKE was slow into stride and shifted off the inside and dropped back, then made a huge five wide move in hand on the turn, came four wide off
the turn while taking over, then drew off through the lane while still in hand to prove much the best. STARSHIP DEFIANT was well placed on the inside
under a hard hold, then was boxed by the three eighths to the quarter pole, angled out for racing room and finished willingly while no match for the winner,
but second best. MURSAL was rated along the inside, saved ground on the turn and then was up for the show award on the inside. DOWNTOWN
MISCHIEF vied for the lead on the inside and weakened in the lane, lost show award late. GIVE ME KISSES vied for the early lead in between rivals,
dropped back on the turn and weakened. GUNFYRE GAL pressed the early pace on the outside, made a four to three wide bid nearing the three eighths
marker and then tired. ESSAOUIRA vied for the early lead three wide, then was between rivals on the turn and tired. PER RULING ECM2024-10 FROM

BERNT AGAIN was hustled from the gate, saved ground while well placed just off the pace, was asked on the far turn, shifted three wide at the
three-eighths pole, rallied outside to get the lead in upper stretch and proved best under steady urging. SMOKIE EYES was taken under a snug hold
nearing the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, took the lead in the two path outside the five-sixteenths, lost the
advantage to the winner in upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed crop near the furlong marker and was outfinished while clear for the place. RACING
COLORS stumbled at the start but broke with the field, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged two then three wide on the far turn,
came five wide into the stretch, remained on her inside lead in the drive and improved for the show. SARATOGA KISSES was hustled from the gate, saved
ground on the first turn, moved out on the backstretch while coaxed along, was urged four wide on the far turn and came up empty. JUST A NYQUIST was
restless in the gate then last away, climbed along the rail early on the first turn then moved to the two path, settled towards the rear, was ridden along
passing the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the far turn, was driven three wide into the stretch, had the rider lose her crop near the sixteenth-pole and
failed to threaten. SHESASCOLDASICE went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged three then four wide on the far turn, came six wide
into the stretch and failed to respond. BERNING HONOR went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, came up empty on the far turn
and retreated. MAGGIE T went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the far
turn, lost the advantage outside the five-sixteenths and stopped.

Footnotes
REFUAH was well placed on the inside, awaited room on the turn, split rivals leaving the turn while making a bid, then hit the front and drew clear by the
furlong marker, then remained clear to the wire to prove best under crop urging. CLEVER FOREVER was settled early, three wide on the turn, swung out
six wide leaving the turn and finished well but could not get to the winner, second best. TWIRLING VINE set a pressured pace on the inside, then vied for
the lead while saving ground on the turn, made a bid approaching the quarter pole to shake clear, but weakened in the drive, stayed on for the show award.
BEARY FUNNY tracked the early pace and made a four wide bid approaching the quarter pole but flattened out. MUGSY FURY was settled back early on
the inside, three wide by the quarter pole but lacked the needed rally late. DOMINATION chased the pace from the outside and weakened. DOLLY'S BANK
pressed the early pace three wide, then vied for the lead in between rivals on the turn but came up empty in the lane. SCHERZANDO stalked the early pace
four to three wide, then vied for the lead three wide, between rivals by the quarter pole and then tired.
