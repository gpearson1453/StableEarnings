Footnotes
BE MY SUNSHINE laid up close in the two path, bid rounding the far turn, kicked away from the inner pacesetter in upper stretch, and held sway under a
drive. TEXAS SHUFFLE tracked in the three path, was roused midway around the far turn, floated out to the five path turning into the lane, and ran on for
place. STARSHIP AURORA raced in midpack along the inside, shifted outward under a ride rounding the far turn, swung from the six path into the stretch,
and stayed on for show. EXCELLENT QUESTION settled wellback in the four path, was roused between foes turning into the stretch, tipped outwards in the
final furlong, but made no impact. MINT EDITION was steadied early around the first turn, stalked inside, tipped out to the four path under a ride turning into
the stretch, but was one paced. CRYSTAL COAST set the pace inside, was cued from the rail turning into the lane, but gaveway on her left lead.
WRITTENINTHESTARS rated in the four path but was never a factor. STELLARATOR hopped at the start, trailed along the rail and never threatened. IDLE
CHATTER raced off the pace in the two path but was no menace.

Footnotes
NEOM CITY settled off the early pace inside, angled three wide leaving the three-eighths marker, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and drew
clear under mild urging. GET FROSTY raced off the early pace outside, advanced three wide around the turn, took over near the quarter pole, drifted out in
upper stretch and then drifted in in final sixteenth and was no match for the winner late. SCOOTALOO was up close two wide, bumped MAS VINO midway
around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and churned on for the show. BABY BLOCKS set the pace along the rail and gave way near the
quarter pole. MAS VINO stalked the pace two and three wide, was bumped midway around the turn and retreated. CRYSTAL REIGN trailed outside.

Footnotes
DEMURELY set the pace in the two path, was under right handed coaxing along the inside early around the turn, opened up while tipping out to the four
path at the top of the lane, and held sway. LIGHT AND PATH stalked from the rail, swung out to the seven path under a drive turning into the stretch, and
ran on for place. NOBLE DREAMER raced up close in the four path, bid midway around the turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane, and
finished evenly for show. LOVE MY JOB trailed in the four path, shifted inwards under coaxing around the turn, cut the corner going into the stretch, but
evened out on her left lead. FOREVER UNCAPTURED chased in the four path, swung out to the eight path turning into the lane, but made no impact.
MACASSA raced off the pace in the five path, but did not factor from out in the ten path in the stretch. DAISY BEE prompted the pace in the three path, but
gaveway turning into the stretch. GIRL BYE rated out in the six path but was no menace.

Footnotes
LITTLE STEVEN set the pace in the three path, drifted out through the stretch run and held firm. NOBLE TIGER raced up close two wide, was bumped hard
midway down the backstretch, regained some of the lost ground still two wide around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, was herded out by the winner
and was gaining on that foe late. JUST FOR LUCK raced off the pace three wide, angled to the rail midway down the backstretch, gained ground at the rail
around the far turn and kept on inside through the stretch to gain the show. HARTSBEATLIKTHUNDR raced off the pace four wide, was bumped near the
five-eighths marker, continued four wide around the far turn and went evenly. PARADISE DRIVE failed to menace while racing two wide. BANDERO was
rated inside around the first turn, was bumped outward midway down the backstretch, moved up to stalk the winner in the three path around the far turn,
continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. REDISUR played no factor while racing two and three wide. MACLIN was outrun while racing four wide.
COPANELLO BAY had early speed inside, came out and bumped foes midway down the backstretch, angled back in soon after and faltered. KID
EMERALD was outrun inside.

Footnotes
SEMINOLE CHIEF prompted the pace in the four path, bid under a nudge in the three path going into the far turn, held a short lead turning into the lane,
and dug in on his left lead down the lane to hold gamely. SECRET LOVER trailed in the four path, was driven in the three path around the far turn, split foes
and angled out to the seven path entering the stretch, and rallied outside of foes for place. BENTORNATO bumped with an outer foe going into the first turn,
stalked in the five path down the backside, bid under right handed urging turning into the lane, was out-finished the winner, but stayed on for show.
MATTINGLY set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside into the far turn, dug in turning into the lane, but faded on his left lead late. LASSO
bobbled at the start, chased in the six path but never factored. CAJUN FOOL tracked in the three path but did not threaten. BRAWN raced off the pace in
the five path but was done after a half.

reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths marker, dueled between foes in upper stretch, drifted out a bit nearing the eighth pole and was outfinished.

pace inside, angled out in upper stretch, was gaining between foes then was shut off and taken up near the eighth pole. READYSEEKGO set the pace in
the two path, battled on to midstretch then weakened. MAKE DECISIONS failed to menace while racing two and three wide. WICKED GENIUS chased the
pace four and five wide and tired in the drive. CHINA BEACH was off a step slow and never threatened while racing three and four wide. BURNING MAN
played no factor while racing four and five wide. DAZZLING TRUTHS was outrun while racing four and five wide. TIMMY M. was outrun inside.

lane, but was no threat. INFAMOUS NONO broke through the gate during the loading process, prompted the pace inside but retreated around the turn.

Footnotes
SKY'S NOT FALLING stalked the pace two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, took a narrow lead near the eighth pole, dueled to the wire and
prevailed. STAT set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner in midstretch, fought on inside of that foe but was narrowly outfinished. ATONE
raced well back inside early, angled out early on the backstretch, advanced four wide around the far turn turn and rallied through the lane to gain the show.
RUNNINGWSCISSORS raced in range three wide and had a mild rally. MUTAAWID was off a bit slowly, saved ground well back and rallied belatedly. HOT
BLOODED failed to menace while racing two and three wide. BLUEBIRDS OVER was rank early, saved ground in midpack and went evenly. CHANCEUX
saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and never threatened. NIGHT JUMPER hit the starting, raced well back two wide early, went five
wide around the far turn and made little impact. LOVE ME NOT played no factor while racing two and three wide.

SKYRO stalked in the three path, floated out to the six path to bid turning into the stretch, took the lead passing the eighth pole, and held safe. AMSTRONG
rated in the three path, swung from the seven path under a drive turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. COUNTY FINAL prompted the pace in the
five path, bid from the three path going into the far turn, led while floating out to the five path at the top of the lane, but faded late to show. LUCKY CURLIN
tracked in the four path, angled out passing the eighth pole, but was one paced. VOLCANIC brushed at the start with an outer foe, set the pace in the three
path, lost the lead along the inside early around the far turn, and faded in the stretch. CALIFORNIA FROLIC brushed between foes at the start, raced
wellback in the three path and made no impact out in the eight path down the lane. NOVO SOL (BRZ) raced off the pace in the four path but did not factor.
ME AND MR. C chased in the four path early but never threatened. WICKED FINN trailed along the inside early but was no menace. LAST ACTION HERO
(BRZ) had an awkward start and brushed with an inner foe, steadied around the first turn, laid in range from the two path but was done after a half.

Footnotes
HONEY DIJON settled in range inside, angled into the three path near the three-eighths pole, took the lead turning for home, continued on the left lead and
drove clear. R HARPER ROSE set the pace in the three path around the first turn and in the two path around the far turn, was collared by the winner in
upper stretch and held well clear of the rest. HAUNTED raced off the pace four wide around both turns and kept on to gain the show without threatening the
top two. REINA MAR failed to menace while racing four and five. FIELDS OF GREEN broke a bit awkwardly, showed speed two wide and faltered around
the far turn. UNRELENTLESS chased the pace two wide, went five wide around the far turn and retreated. PARDY PLEASER played no factor while racing
two and three wide. DANCING N DIXIE was outrun while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
FELIX tracked in the two path, waited confidently behind the leaders around the turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the lane, and kept on to be up
in the final strides. HARRY'S ONTHEFLY raced in midpack in the three path, was roused between foes while swinging out to the six path into the stretch,
and ran on for place. CRUZIN MAN set the pace in the two path, was cued nearing the quarter, kicked away in upper stretch, but was caught late by an
outer pair to show. LISTENTOTHEMUSIC raced off the pace in the three path, swung from the seven path into the stretch, and stayed on.
WHENIGETTOHEAVEN raced in the back of the pack from the two path, was stymied early around the turn, shifted out to the six path turning into the lane,
but couldn't make an impact. REBEL POSSE raced wellback along the inside, was in traffic rounding the turn, and could not get involved in the five path
down the lane, was pulled up on the gallop out and vanned off. HIGHLY FLAMMABLE trailed in the two path, went very wide turning into the lane, and was
no factor. TOWN BARBER rated in the five path, angled into the two path turning into the stretch, but flattened. NICHIREN pressed in the three path but
yielded in the stretch. ZYRAMID bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the five path, drifted out to the nine path in upper stretch, and did not
threaten. NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) was prompted along in midfield from the six path, but weakened turning into the lane. AWESOME FLAY bumped with
an inner foe at the start, chased in the four path but gaveway along the inside turning into the stretch.
