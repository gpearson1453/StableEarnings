Footnotes
BARRELHOUSE stalked the early pace two deep, moved to even terms at the seven eighths pole and took the nod past the nine sixteenths, dueled clear
approaching the three eighths, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to edge out the game stretch challenge of
MARCUS JUNIUS, who settled in the three path, gave chase passing the half mile pole, moved to even terms two deep midway on the far turn and dug in
gamely to the finish. ONLY GET'N BETTER raced well off the pace in the five path the first turn then moved to the inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole
and steadily improved from that point, rounded the far turn about the five path and came along for third later yards. S S SPARTAN ENERGY raced in the
three path the opening turn then saved some ground, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then
flattened in the lane. LEG UP set the early pace inside but was met at even terms leaving the seven eighths pole, gave up the nod at the nine sixteenths,
chased from the half mile pole but dropped back toward the three eighths and faded at the rail on the far turn. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS rounded the
opening turn about the four path and showed little response through the backstretch. CALIFORNIA GHOST rated close to the early pace inside but faded at
the rail on the second turn. I SEE NOTHING saved ground off the early pace, eased out into the backstretch but showed little response.

the final yards. PRINCESS MARGARET raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase passing the half mile pole and rounded the far turn in the four path,
dug in leaving the turn and took third the final strides. SHE'S A BRICKHOUSE rated close inside the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. LIME STAR raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole
and faded in the four path on the far turn. S S FLAMINGO raced in the five path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. TRUE
