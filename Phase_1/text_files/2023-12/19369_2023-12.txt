Footnotes
PHOTO HOP , along the inner rail down the backstretch stalking the pace, eased out to the two path entering the far turn, secured command outside
RETURN FIRE in upper stretch, was under the whip in the lane, drew away and was difficult to pull up galloping out. RETURN FIRE gained a two wide lead,
leaving the backstretch saved ground around the far turn, was over taken in upper stretch and willingly held the place. EL DE LARRY , three deep the first
turn, passed horses while in the two path entering the stretch and failed to menace. OPENING HOURS , never a factor, floated five deep entering the
stretch. SIMON'S CHOICE offered a mild, four wide move on the far turn then gave way through the stretch. VOLPE set a pressured pace along the inner
rail, lost the lead into the far turn and weakened there after. SUGAR HOOF , three wide chasing the pace for six furlongs, faltered in upper stretch.
CHIPANDAPUTT trailed.

Footnotes
RATIFIED settled in the clear and off of a four pronged pace dispute, edged closer under asking mid turn, swung six wide for the drive, closed in under stout
left handed encouragement, took command outside FIVECOMMATWO leaving the sixteenth pole and was fully extended to hold sway. FIVECOMMATWO ,
four deep with the pace, took over four wide and outside rivals soon into the lane, shook clear under a drive leaving the three sixteenths, dug in when
collared near the sixteenth pole and kept on valiantly. DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD saved ground under rating, took closer order mid turn, awaited room in upper
stretch, worked between runners leaving mid stretch and chuned on. OUT OF LUCK , urged from the gate, was guided towards the inner rail early on,
stayed inside while trailing into the lane, came out for the final furlong but was unable to make an impact. MEETMEATTHEBEACH , three wide between
rivals forcing the pace, stayed on to about mid turn and gave way. KILBRITTAIN'S RED sped up to the inside of rivals to take command, set a pressured
pace towards the rail, ceded command in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong. POLICE WOMAN was used two wide between runners to
contest the pace, steadied while unable to keep pace past the five sixteenths and tired.

Footnotes
PERFECT DAY broke sharply and disputed the early pace to the inside of CLOUD MUSIC, edged clear of that one while rated along mid turn, responded
and opened up in upper stretch, shied outward a few times when shown the left crop, corrected late and held firm under steady hand pressure. SWIFTY
DEVIL chased the leaders while off the rail, shifted out four to five wide in upper stretch, kept on gamely and earned the place. BOSS MAN J J dropped in
early to save ground, advanced towards the rail into the lane, eased out with pursuit, kept on willingly to gain but was out kicked for second. HELDISH broke
a step slow, saved ground off the pace, cut the corner into the lane, moved up near the sixteenth marker but flattened out very late. VICTIM OF THE NITE
hopped the break, moved up off the inside to be in range leaving the far turn, chased and came up empty in the final furlong. SALOON , brushed at the
break, was sluggish early, lost ground four wide leaving the far turn and failed to generate a serious run. CLOUD MUSIC , away alertly, vied outside the
winner into the turn, could not quicken with that one past the three eighths, pursued three wide nearing the lane and tired. RASCALLY REBEL brushed with
SALOON leaving the gate, raced off the pace and three wide leaving the far turn then lacked any solid kick.

GREELEY AND BEN lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, found room along the inner rail through the stretch, closed determinedly and was up at the
wire. JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, drifted out in mid
stretch and just missed. HE'SMYHONEYBADGER brushed with IKIGAI at the start, was outside horses on the turn, left the bend four deep and flattened
out. KARAN'S NOTION , a forward factor in the two path for a half mile, chased the pace and gave way. IKIGAI brushed with HE'SMYHONEYBADGER
leaving the starting gate, chased the pace while in the three path around the turn and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FORMAL ORDER settled off of a contested early pace while saving ground, gained in hand heading to the half mile marker, eased out with aim past the
three eighths, moved three to the attack into the lane, forged clear under a drive leaving the three sixteenths, widened and was kept alert to late. FERMAT
stumbled at the break, regrouped and raced well back while saving some ground, angled out leaving the far turn, circled five to six wide into the lane, closed
steadily and just got up for second. TRANSFER THE FUNDS , taken to rate off the pace while saving ground, edged up towards the rail into the far turn,
came out near the five sixteenths, straightened four to five wide for the drive, advanced outside MONYINTHEBANKSEY leaving mid stretch, churned on but
was nipped for the place. MONYINTHEBANKSEY was sent up to the inside of PATRIOTIC PARTY entering the first turn, dueled inside that one, moved
clear around the final turn, could not resist the winner soon into the lane then gave way grudgingly through the final furlong. SOUPER CATCH , three wide
past the five eighths, failed to respond. CARIBBEAN (AUS) , mid pack and off the rail, was under pressure between rivals leaving the three eighths and
lacked a kick. PATRIOTIC PARTY sped clear in the initial furlong, was hooked from his inside near the seven and a half furlong marker, battled to the far
turn, gave chase past the three eighths then tired in upper stretch. MY BOY COLTON , between rivals near the five eighths, pursued to the inside of a
runner near the five sixteenths then gave way. BATTALION stumbled at the break, lost ground four to five wide and gave way.

KISSEDBYANANGEL set the pace in the two path around the turn, was challenged on her outside by SHEILAHS WARCLOUD near the eighth pole,
asserted herself and drew out under urging. SHEILAHS WARCLOUD stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced three deep on the turn, loomed in
mid stretch and flattened out. BIG EARN dropped back some entering the turn, was along the inner rail near the three eighths pole, swung out at the head of
the stretch, remained on her left lead and passed tired foes. BINNIE advanced in the three path leaving the turn, was well positioned in upper stretch and
gave way. LUCKY COUGAR , along the inner rail on the turn and in the stretch, was no factor. DETERMINED SAIL , a forward factor along the inner rail,
chased the pace to the quarter pole then gave way. STILL GAME dwelt when acting up at the break, was fanned four wide entering the stretch and was no
factor. LITTLE CRYBABY was outrun. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

Footnotes
CIRCLE P settled off the rail and off of a contested early pace, gathered momentum and advanced three wide into the lane, moved up to the inside of a rival
and under left handed asks in mid stretch, eased out soon after, forged past the leader with about fifty yards remaining and drew clear under a steady hand
ride. CATAHOULA MOON was sent from the gate to engage SPEEDYNESS from his inside, battled with that one through swift fractions, shook clear into
the lane, remained on his left lead past mid stretch, faded late but remained well clear of the rest. SPEEDYNESS broke sharp and held a slim early
advantage, dueled outside CATAHOULA MOON into and around the turn, failed to match strides while three wide into the lane then faded in deep stretch.
CALL ME ANDY , well placed in the clear and stalking the embattled leaders, gave futile chase two wide into the lane, failed to go on past mid stretch and
weakened. HITTHEROADJAK drifted out at the break, corrected and was coaxed along off the inside, circled four wide into the stretch but lacked a punch
through the final three sixteenths. CAP COM bumped with KING'S RIVER soon after the start, rated off the pace while saving ground, eased out after a half
mile but failed to generate a rally. KING'S RIVER , bumped soon after the break, lagged far back, swung wide in upper stretch and had belated action.
MISTER AGENT chased the pace off the rail, angled in around the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
LADY CHARLOTTE bobbled slightly leaving the starting gate, sped to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail, pulled away and was under the whip in
mid stretch. REE NEE'S SIX raced in the two path on the turn, chased the winner and held the place. SHEHERHERS lacked speed, was in the two path on
the turn, moved to the inner rail turning for home and had a slight rally. OUTFACTORED , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, drifted out entering
the stretch and weakened. AT FIRST SIGHT hugged the inner rail on the turn and gave way before going a half mile. LEAVE DRAMA BEHIND bore out
leaving the starting gate, circled horses on the turn and faltered approaching the stretch. AMORICA , outrun, was eased through the stretch and jogged off.
