Footnotes
FIRED UP TIGER pressed two wide, vied along with an outer pair of bidders into the far turn, got headed by those foes turning for home, yet fought on
through midstretch and forged an advantage in the final sixteenth. LIKEN IT broke outwardly, settled off of the pace in the two path, ranged up outside of the
leading trio approaching the far turn, vied four wide around that bend, gained an advantage entering the lane, but drifted out when the rider changed to left
handed pressure entering the final sixteenth and was bested by an inner bidder late. FOOLISH STEVE stalked outside of the top pair, bid when an outer
rival forced his hand approaching the far turn, vied between horses around that bend, dueled into the final furlong but yielded late. UNCLE BRAD was sent
to the fore, dictated terms before vying with a trio of outer bidders into the far turn, but was headed turning for home and gradually gave way. KELLYS THE
BOSS lagged well behind the rest and surpassed a tiring rival around the far turn. GOTTAGONOWNOW broke a step slow and steadied when an inner rival
cut across her path, advanced to an inside stalking position around the first turn, but chased the leading quartet into the far turn and weakened in the two
path around that bend.

Footnotes
LULU'S MAGIC took contact from an outer rival at the start, set the pace in the two path, shook free in upper stretch and held firm. HART'S PRETTY GIRL
tracked along the inside, then chased well to edge place in the final furlong and held that position from an outer late bidder. CANA GRIS saved ground off of
the pace, searched for racing room off the fence entering the lane, tipped to the five path in upper stretch and offered a mild rally to miss reaching place.
EUROSTORM took light contact from an inner foe soon after the start, returned the favor soon after, tracked four wide, ranged up turning for home to be
within striking range of the leader entering the lane, but delayed a lead change until the three sixteenths pole, only managed to chase the leader thereafter
and tired between horses in the final sixteenth. SWEET GUITAR broke through the gate pre-race, chased two wide and between horses, but failed to
sustain forward position while under strong urging turning for home, yet kept on for a minor placing through the lane. QUITEGIRL broke a step slow while
last away, trailed along the inside, swung out to the seven path in upper stretch and moved up. LET'S TALK DIRTY lacked speed in the three path, fanned
to the eight path in upper stretch and failed to menace. DESPEIGHTFUL brushed an outer rival soon after the start before taking contact from that one
shortly after, stalked three wide, chased within range along with an outer rival nearing the lane but faded. STORMY COUNTRY DAY broke inwardly and
bumped a rival at the start, tracked two wide and between horses into the turn, shifted out turning for home, drifted to the six path in upper stretch and
faded.

Footnotes
AFLEET ASCENT pressed two wide, then from the three path around the far turn, bid while shifting out to the five path in upper stretch and edged clear in
the late stages. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER set the pace inside of a pressing foe, showed the way in the two path around the far turn, dug in to resist the
aforementioned rival's bid in upper stretch, sparred while subtly getting headed in midstretch, then yielded in the final sixteenth and narrowly lasted for place
between bidders. CALLINGINTHENIGHT tracked three wide, pursued the top pair form the two path around the far turn, tipped to the four path in upper
stretch, chased well to offer a late bid for place but missed. MAGAWILDTIME laid off of the pace in the three to two path, then sustained a grinding charge
inside of rivals to produce a late bid for place but just came up short. CITY PARK laid off of the pace along the inside, then from the three path around the
far turn before moving to the six path in upper stretch, then ran on willingly. GUITARTUITION PLZZ was fidgeting about prior to the start, remained restless
at the gates opened and spotted the leaders multiple lengths, raced at the rear along the inside, then moved up. SENATOR CON tracked along the inside
and faded turning for home. SCORING DRIVE lacked speed in the two to three path, fanned out to the seven path in upper stretch and made little impact.
WIN YA WIN broke half a beat slow, raced at the rear two wide and was outrun.

FAST BREAK prompted two wide, dueled approaching the far turn, drew clear nearing the lane, drifted about thereafter yet was kept together to hold sway.
KEYS INCLUDED lacked speed along the inside, then stayed on to gain place from between horses nearing the final sixteenth. WISE GUY tracked along
the inside, shifted out entering the lane, but only offered a mild kick before being outkicked by an inner bidder in the final furlong. MAX PANDOWDY tracked
two wide, floated to the five path entering the lane and weakened. SECOND OF JULY broke inwardly, set the pace inside of a prompting foe, dueled with
that one into the far turn, yielded turning for home and stopped. THE GRAY BLUR was outrun two wide, but sustained an injury at the furlong grounds and
was vanned off

Footnotes
OPTIMUS KAT took light contact from an inner rival at the start, tracked two wide, ranged up three wide around the far turn to bid entering the lane, then
drove clear at the furlong grounds and held sway. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) lacked speed in the two to three path, fanned to the seven path in upper stretch
then rallied to gain place in the final sixteenth. SHADY MCGEE (IRE) broke a step slow, trailed along the inside, advanced around the far turn before
awaiting racing room nearing the lane, shifted out and split foes in the four path leaving the furlong grounds, ran on but was outkicked by an outer rival for
place in the final sixteenth. NILES CHANNEL broke outwardly and brushed a foe at the start, then eased back from crowded quarters between horses early
on, pursued from midpack along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, tipped to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a bid while hanging on his
left lead between horses. PEPPER JACK set the pace tucking from the three path to the inside around the first turn, showed the way around the far turn, but
was headed by an outer bidder in upper stretch and gave way. LITTLE G T bumped with an outer rival at the start, pressed outside of the leader and from
the four to two path around the first turn, sustained pressure as an outer rival ranged up around the far turn, then yielded between horses in upper stretch.
SUPER WISE settled off of the pace in the two path, pursued four wide around the far turn, floated to the six path entering the lane and lacked a rally
between horses. BAKENEKO lacked speed along the inside, trailed around the far turn and was outrun thereafter. SIERRA HOTEL bumped with an inner
rival at the start, stalked along the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
GLENN'S JUMPER set a clear pace in the two path, shifted in as an inner HOMEVIEW attempted a bid at the furlong grounds, straightened course before
shifting across that one's path again at the sixteenth pole, tired as that rival offered an outside bid approaching the wire, yet lasted. HOMEVIEW tracked
along the inside, took aim inside of the clear leader in upper stretch, but lacked rail room to attempt a bid inside of that foe at the furlong grounds, altered
course outside of the drifting leader at the sixteenth pole, sustained a belated bid and came up short. TWO DOT broke slow, laid off of the pace in the three
path around the turn, offered a bid for show inside of rivals nearing the furlong grounds, then ran on willingly while closing in on the tiring leaders. LIONS
NOT SHEEP chased three wide and between horses, then two wide while in the three path around the turn, failed to keep pace with the top pair in upper
stretch, then kept on in the final furlong. WEST WARPATH tracked two wide, but failed to sustain position into the turn, shifted out in midstretch and stayed
on mildly. BUNKIE'S SONG broke a step slow, lacked speed along the inside, trailed around the turn then surpassed tired rivals. LUCKY LOUIE stalked four
wide, then three wide while in the four path around the turn, but entered the lane in the fie path and weakened. COURAGEOUS TIMMY broke slowly and
was outrun in the four path. THE RIDER OFHOMEVIEW CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF GLENN'S JUMPER FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE
FINAL FURLONG, FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, GLENN'S JUMPER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED
SECOND.

SWEET TEMPERAMENT set the pace in the two path, braced for an outer challenge while entering the lane in the three path, turned away her outer
challenger while drifting out in upper stretch, lugged further out through the final furlong and held sway. BREEZE EASY (GB) tracked along the inside,
steadied subtly while sustaining forward inside position into the turn, smoothly tipped to the three path to take aim outside of the leader at the fie sixteenths
pole, loomed a danger in the four path entering the lane, but was turned away in upper stretch, chased while being herded outwardly by the leader through
midstretch, altered course inside of that one in the final sixteenth and was kept at bay. EVE'S DELIGHT tracked two wide and between horses, but backed
out from among foes into the turn, shifted to the four path shortly after before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, lacked progress while moving
lanes outwardly exiting upper stretch, then flopped back to her left lead in the final furlong and moved up late. SALLY'S SUPRISE leaned out and bumped a
foe at the start, trailed along the inside, saved ground, shifted to the three path in upper stretch and improved between horses in the final furlong. PICANA
(CHI) took contact from an inner rival at the start, stalked in the four path, floated to the five path turning for home, then yielded between horses in the final
furlong. CORA PEARL pressed the leader from the three path, but yielded between horses while getting floated to the four path at the five sixteenths pole,
cut the corner entering the lane and weakened through the final furlong. MOVE IT BABY lacked speed while hung in the six to eight path and was outrun.
THE RIDER OF BREEZE EASY (GB) CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SWEET TEMPERAMENT FOR INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE
LANE, FOLLOWING HTE OBJECTION AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, SWEET TEMPERAMENT WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
MADAM BLUE broke outwardly before quickly speeding clear early on, showed the way in the three to four path around the turn and held sway safely under
a drive. NICELY UNIFIED was a bit antsy awaiting the start, tracked two wide, entered the lane in the four path and ran on to edge place in the final furlong.
KASENS TRIBE broke a step slow and trailed early on, picked up stride in the four path into the turn, sustained progress fanning to the six path entering the
lane and stayed on to reach show at the wire. CUSTOM COMEDY was briefly fractious in the starting gate, stalked along the inside, chased the clear leader
through upper stretch, lost place nearing the final sixteenth, tired thereafter and got caught at the wire for show. MY SUGAR FIX pursued from midpack
three wide, entered the lane in the five path and lacked a bid. STRUMMIN MARY bobbled a bit at the start, lacked speed along the inside then improved
position up the rail. WAKE UP DOLORES laid off of the pace in the two path, then inside around the turn and weakened. QUEENS RIOT leaned out and
exchanged contact with an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the two path but weakened between horses around the turn.
