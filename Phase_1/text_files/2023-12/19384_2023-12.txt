Footnotes
GAMING SOUL slow early angled out in mid stretch rallying up past mid track. MIGHTY FROSTED stalked the pace pressing to upper stretch bidding late
four wide. GRAND SIR advanced on the backside clearing on the far turn hooked between horses in upper stretch would weaken. JOHN'S KID slow early
lagged to upper stretch gaining modestly late six wide. LIL MR MATT pressed the pace vying inside to upper stretch weakening late. EXECUTIVE PRIZE
raced evenly wearing down on the far turn. IRIE ISLAND MAN was always outrun. CAJUN BAYOU folded up after a half mile. GALLIPOLIS offered little.
