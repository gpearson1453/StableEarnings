Footnotes
IF WE GET LUCKY was away alertly to set the pace while clear and in the two path, then remained clear and widened the margin off the turn, then was kept
to task to remain clear to prove best. BAYOU SHACK was rated along two wide, came four wide into the lane and rallied well. ASHAAB was allowed to
settle early, eased out midway on the turn and came five wide into the lane and finished with good energy to just miss the place award. SPENDOLINI
tracked the winner and made a mild bid three wide but faded in the drive. RAGING BEAR was bumped at the start, reserved early three wide, dropped to
the inside on the turn and had no rally. LUCKY DUDE lunged at the start and was off slowly, then came four wide into the lane and was no threat.
FREEDOM'S START was fractious in the gate, chased the pace four wide and weakened. KEYSTONE HANK was settled back on the inside and failed to
menace.

AMOUNT was void of early speed, advanced on the inside, angled out leaving the three sixteenths and made a bid and drew clear in the furlong grounds to
prove best, driving. NO MORE TALK was well rated along the inside, shifted out and made a five wide bid off the turn, but proved to be no match for the
winner late, clearly second best. WENTZ set a pressured pace on the inside, then made a bid to shake clear leaving the turn, but weakened the final
furlong, bested rest. GUSHING OIL was four wide into the first turn, pressed the pace three wide and made a two wide bid on the turn but weakened. JUST
NOD AND SMILE passed the tiring rivals. BLOOD MOON was allowed to settle early and lacked a rally. C C'S WARRIOR was five wide into the first turn,
stalked the pace four wide and tired. DIGGERS DIAMOND was reserved early three wide, came wide into the lane and was not a threat. SNEADS was not
a factor while wide. ARISTOCAT chased the pace three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
DEE JAY was away alertly to make the front and drop to the inside on the first turn, was well handled and ridden along nearing the quarter pole and
widened the margin off the turn, then drifted out slightly nearing the sixteenth marker under left handed crop, then held sway late to prove best, driving.
BOSS LOGIC stalked the winner two wide, then came three wide into then was gaining in the furlong grounds and had to alter course slightly leaving the
sixteenth marker and then finished willingly but could not get to the winner, second best. PRINCE OF RAIN was rated along the inside, roused leaving the
five sixteenths but lacked the needed winning bid, bested rest. BUSINESS MODEL was settled early on the inside, came five wide into the lane and had no
rally. GRAND WISER tracked the pace three wide and weakened. WISH FOR PEACE was reserved early, saved ground on the turn and was not a threat.

FILTERED LIGHT was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command, then was two wide off the
turn and dueled for the lead and then kicked clear to prove best, driving. DRY HUMOR settled out of the gate, shifted to the outside on the first turn and
tracked the pace, made a four wide move on the turn to vie for command on the outside, then dueled for the lead off the turn and then could not go with the
winner in the final furlong, clearly second best. FOREVER FIFI was allowed to settle on the inside, swung out five wide leaving the turn and rallied well to
gain the show award. OMIKAMI was well placed throughout, three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and finished willingly but lost the show
award late. CHARLIZE CHUB was three wide into the first turn, then set a pressured pace while in the two path, then vied for the lead in between rivals on
the turn and tired. BIG SIS NIC pressed the pace and made a bid on the inside on the turn but tired.
