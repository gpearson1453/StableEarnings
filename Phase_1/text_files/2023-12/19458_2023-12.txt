Footnotes
HIDDEN IDENTITY rallied to lead on turn extending abreast foe in upper stretch edging clear under urging. CAPTAIN ANNE pressed inside to upper stretch
extending willingly the final eighth near the rail. BELLA BASORA slow early came five wide to upper stretch using even action to best the others. SMOOKIE
chased early then dropped off on the turn racing evenly along the inside down the lane. EVER SO D'WILD chased through the turn weakening the final
eighth. PSYCHOANALYST played no factor. LOLA FLO ducked out sharply at the break. TREASURED NIKKY pressed early giving way to upper stretch.
SHANGHAI KIMMY folded up on the turn.
