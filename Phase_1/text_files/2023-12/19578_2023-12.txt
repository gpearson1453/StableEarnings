Footnotes
SIR MASON broke alertly to clear the field quickly, opened a decisive advantage through the turn and held well down the lane while weakening late.
KOLTEN'S PRIDE reserved off the early pace for the first three-eighths, saved ground on the bend cutting the corner coming home and rallied well down
the lane. SPIRIT OF SEATTLE unhurried early to trail, circled five wide on the turn while steadily advancing and finished willingly just being denied the
place. INCITATUSWAY stalked the pace to the turn, made a mild bid turning for home and flattened out down the lane. DESTINO was never a threat.
STANDINGINTHEFIRE chased the pacesetter to the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
J P'S GLADYS stalked the pace through the turn, rallied from four wide turning for home and wore the pacesetter down in the final strides. VACATION
SECRET set the pace from the onset, opened a clear lead in the turn, maintained that advantage to mid-stretch, responded well but was unable to hold off
the winner in deep stretch in a game effort. SPLASH OF TONIC prompted the pace through the turn, saved ground turning for home and kept on through
the lane unable to gain on the leaders. OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY tracked the leaders to upper stretch and finished willingly to narrow the margin late in the
lane. MITESSE chased the pace from the fence into the turn, lost position in the bend and passed weaker rivals in the stretch. CAGUA unhurried in the early
going, rallied mildly on the bend and flattened out in the lane. SECRET SEDUCTION never posed a threat.

Footnotes
HE'S A SHOOTER took command leaving the gate, opened a clear advantage in the first turn, controlled the tempo down the backside, widened turning for
home and was never challenged in a dominant performance. BOBBY'S GIFT tracked the leader from three wide down the backside, mounted a bid in the
turn, was no match for the winner but finished willingly to hold the place. GUARD prompted the early pace, remained in striking distance to the head of the
lane and kept on through the lane to maintain his position. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE mounted an early bid down the backside to attempt to engage the
leader, dropped back on the bend while saving ground having been unable to sustain his bid and finished evenly. EXALTED JOY passed tiring rivals down
the stretch. JACK'S ADVANTAGE went one-paced failing to menace. DUEL FUEL trailed most of the way and passed weaker rivals late. DEER CREEK
ROAD never threatened. BIG FALCON ROCKET contended early and faded coming home.

Footnotes
MAUREENLOVESFRANK raced well off the rail while taking command from the gate, remained in the five path while being well rationed on the front end,
opened a clear lead in the final turn and maintained that advantage to the wire in a well handled ride. SPECIAL BEACH stalked the pace through the final
turn, rallied turning for home, could not gain on the winner while finishing well to be second best. ONE NIGHT STAND reserved off the early pace, rallied up
the fence saving all the ground in the turn and finished evenly to hold the show. SASSY JUSTICE unhurried early on and made a grinding rally in the turn to
improve his position. ANNMARIA tracked the pacesetter to upper stretch and failed to mount a closing bid. ANIPPE pressed the pace for three quarters of a
mile and weakened in the stretch. GO STELLAIRE passed tiring rivals late. BACKSPLASH was never a threat. DESIGNATE was not a factor. ACCOLADES
GALORE dropped back through the final bend, was eased in mid-stretch and walked off.

BLUE HOUR set a well rated pace in the early going, opened a clear advantage in the turn and drew off without being threatened in the lane.
CONSTITUTIONALIST broke wide, raced up to be on the early pace, chased the winner through the turn, was no match for that one but finished well as an
easy second best. BELLAVALENCIA reserved off the pace down the backside, saved ground on the turn and rallied mildly in the lane to gain the show.
MISS LINDYSUE chased the two pacesetters through the turn and kept on down the lane. SOLDAT TEMPTATION unhurried early, rallied eight wide at the
top of the stretch and showed some late interest. IMA SURE BET raced near the rear of the field to the quarter pole, split rivals from four wide in upper
stretch and improved position down the lane. BEAUTY IN MOTION well placed tracking the pace for a half and flattened out turning for home. ITALIAN
TWIN failed to menace. ICEY ANGEL had no impact. ARTUME was not a threat. NOGRATZ was not a factor.

VAIL OF HONOR unhurried early to be well behind the field, rallied seven wide circling the field in the final bend and closed with a rush to be up in the final
strides. BARRELHOUSE stalked the pace to the far turn racing five wide in the clear, rallied to take the lead nearing the quarter pole, maintained the
advantage through the lane gamely and was caught in the shadow of the wire. KHOPILOT reserved off the pace to be mid-pack in a clear pocket down the
backside, rallied from six wide in the turn and finished well through the lane while working around traffic. HOUSED tracked the leaders down the backside,
rallied inside the pace makers in the turn to loom boldly and flattened out in upper stretch. GAMING SOUL went evenly without being a threat. KILLER BEE
slow early to be at the rear of the field and passed tired rivals in the stretch. GIZMO'S MISSION sped to the lead in the first turn, opened a clear margin
down the backside and gave way when challenged on the bend. WHISKEY SUNRISE prompted the pace for a half mile and came up empty.

Footnotes
TWO GUNS set the pace while racing well off the fence down the backside, repelled the challenge of the runner-up in mid-stretch and drew clear to the
wire. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL prompted the pace through the far turn, ranged up to engage the leader in upper stretch, was unable to go with that one but
finished willingly as the evident second best. MY TWO AUNT JOANS stalked the pace into the far turn, rallied up the fence to threaten on the bend and
flattened out turning for home. PEACE OF EKATI slow early to be a distant trailer and showed good energy with a belated rally in the stretch. BEYOND MY
DREAMS rated in mid-pack throughout and failed to mount a closing rally. RUBINSTEIN settled off the pace to the head of the lane and made a mild bid
while encountering traffic down the stretch. NO MORE TALK contended while well placed tracking the leaders and weakened turning for home. SAY HEY
KID was not a threat. DEBDURITE chased the leaders early and steadily faded.

Footnotes
WOODYTHEBIDSPOTTER set the pace from the inside, widened the advantage into the turn, repelled the bid of the runner-up in upper stretch and pulled
away down the lane. MSHINDI stalked the pace through the turn, rallied four wide to threaten the leader turning for home, was outkicked down the stretch
but finished a clear second best. MIGHTY PELE raced well off the pace despite encouragement through the turn, found best stride late and showed belated
energy to make late gains. LOCO tracked the leaders through the turn while well place inside, was set to a drive and failed to gain ground coming home.
RESVALON bumped outside rival early on causing that one to be squeezed out, dropped back while re-gaining stride to be near the rear and passed tiring
rivals down the stretch. WHEN IN ROME went one-paced as a non-threat. YARDMAN squeezed between rivals early away from the gate, stumbled as
result of the bumping, nearly falling or unseating rider, dropped out the rear of the field, was gathered up and finished evenly having lost all chance. AKITO
bobbled shortly away from the gate, rushed up to prompt the pace for a half and gave way in the lane.
