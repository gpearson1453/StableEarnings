Footnotes
NO MAS CERVEZA slow early to be the distant trailer, angled six wide at the top of the lane while finding his best stride and closed with a rush to be up in
time. LEWIS AND CLARK stalked the pace down the backside, split rivals under a steady drive at the quarter pole to engage the leader from three wide,
lugged in briefly down the lane, straightened out and finished willingly. R CLIFFHANGER set the pace under pressure early, opened a clear lead in the turn,
responded down the lane while drifting out in mid-stretch and was caught in the final hundred yards in a game effort. PAYMASTER GENERAL crowded at
the start, raced up to contend on the backstretch, was called upon in the turn to be prominent and failed to sustain his rally in the lane. CAN'T
CRASHMYPARTY went evenly posing no threat. FORMYBOYS showed brief speed to press the pace and came up empty on the turn.

Footnotes
ELLE'SBIGSEACRET stalked the dueling pacesetters into the turn, circled three wide to take command straightening out for home and drew off in the lane
convincingly. CHACO SPIRIT slow early to be well off the leaders, rallied turning for home and closed well to be up for the place. LIMIT UP set a pressured
pace from the fence, responded when called upon, was no match for the winner and kept-on well through the stretch only to be caught late for the place.
THE COOKIE MAN pressed the pace fo the head of the stretch and flattened out in the lane.

Footnotes
SHEWEARSMYRING reserved off the pace down the backside, made a steady advance along the rail on the far turn, cut the corner and finished well up the
fence to take command late. ISLANDINTHESTREAM set a pressured pace for three-quarters, shook clear turning for home, finished willingly and was
caught in deep stretch in a game effort. ECHOLITE tracked the pace while well placed three wide, threatened turning for home and lacked a strong enough
late response. TRAMA QUEEN stalked the leaders from three wide through the final bend and finished evenly failing to gain ground in the stretch. LADY
CAIRO pressed the pace to the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. WAR VOW raced wide in the first turn, settled near the rear of the field down the
backside, rallied into the far turn and flattened out in upper stretch. ZIPSY ROSE LEE was one-paced never offering a threat. QUICKSTYLE trailed most of
the way. BROADWAY CHARM steadily faded to the rear of the field.

Footnotes
CASUAL ATTIRE stalked the pace from the fence down the backside, cut the corner when the pacesetting stablemate drifted off the fence turning for home,
took command in upper stretch and cleared off down the lane. TEAM LEYENDECKER prompted the pace from two wide to the quarter pole, overtook the
pacesetter turning for home, was carried out to the four path and could not go with the rail skimming winner. KNOCK WOOD reserved off the pace to the far
turn and made a steady grinding advance coming home. HIDDEN ACCESS set the pace to the far turn on a clear lead, responded to go with the challenger
at the quarter pole, drifted off the fence turning for home opening the rail for the winner and weakened down the lane. VENTURE ON well placed for the first
half mile and faded coming home. MONSTER HUNTER trailed most of the way as a non-threat. MARVIN'S EXPRESS failed to menace.

Footnotes
LIGHT UP MY LIFE set a pressured pace while racing three wide, shook off the pressers in upper stretch and drew clear in the lane. FALL CAMPAIGN
reserved off the pace in mid-pack, circled six wide turning for home and closed well down the stretch to gain the place. JUMP INTO SANITY settled off the
leaders down the backside, rallied five wide in the turn to be prominent at the head of the lane and kept-on willingly. DULCE VICTORIA pressed the pace
from the inside through the turn and weakened late in the drive. IRON BERTIE tracked the leaders from the fence to the bend, dropped back on the turn and
finished evenly. BIG BANG BLUE trailed to the quarter pole and passed weaker rivals in the lane. LORI'S EYES went evenly failing to menace. MOON
PARTY broke wide leaving the gate, continued to be wide down the backside and lacked a response when called upon. VAVITE was one-paced failing to
threaten. CREATIVE CADENCE stalked the leaders from four wide through the turn and gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
CORNER KICK hustled early to gain position down the backside, rallied four wide in the turn to engage the leader in upper stretch, dueled down the lane
and prevailed in deep stretch. LADY LOTTIE set a pressured pace from the fence, responded when challenged at the head of the lane to battle down the
stretch and was out-finished in the closing strides. FOREST B pressed the pace from between rivals to the head of the lane and finished evenly as no match
for the top pair. OAXACA rated in mid-pack well ahead of the second flight and mounted a mild bid down the lane. GO STELLAIRE failed to menace.
CAUSE OF LOVE was never a threat. FABULOUS CLOWN trailed most of the way as a non-factor. SHEZ SHACKED UP pressed the pace from three wide
and gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
ZAKARIA sped off to a clear lead shortly away from the gate, maintained the advantage to the head of the lane, responded when called upon and was never
threatened. OKLAHOMA JOE stalked the pacesetter through the turn, was always well placed in striking distance and failed to gain on the winner. MALIBU
CLASSIC tracked the leaders from between rivals in the turn, made a mild rally to the top of the lane and finished evenly. EXCITEMENT reserved off the
pace to the turn, made a four wide bid to the head of the stretch, angled in down the lane and lacked a closing response. EL ROSILLO passed weaker rivals
in the lane while mounting a mild rally. HOPPY GILMORE contended early and flattened out turning for home. EL MARRO was never a factor. WILLIE
WANDO steadily dropped back.

Footnotes
COMMISSIONER D reserved off the pace along the rail, saved ground through the turn, waited briefly at the quarter pole for racing room, split rivals turning
for home, angled wide in upper stretch and closed with a rush to be going away at the wire. HISTORYINTHEMAKING prompted the pace from two wide to
upper stretch, briefly took command down the lane but could not hold off the fast charging winner. MY DANIELA well placed tracking the leader from three
wide, rallied to threaten in mid-stretch and was outkicked to the wire. B SASSI settled off the pace for the first quarter, rallied five wide to loom boldly turning
for home and failed to sustain his bid. WINGS OF HEAVEN set a pressured pace throughout, battled down the lane and weakened late in the drive while in
close quarters along the rail. COWGIRLS HUMOR passed tiring rivals in the stretch. HOT PRINCESS showed speed for three-eighths and faded. LATE
BLOOMBOPPER trailed most of the way as a non-factor. BOLD RUBY contended for a half mile and stopped in the stretch.
