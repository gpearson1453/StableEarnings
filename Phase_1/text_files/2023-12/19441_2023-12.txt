Footnotes
WINKIWINKI vied for the early lead from the inside, raced clear along the inside around the far turn, drifted through the stretch and held well to remain clear
under steady handling. SWEET HEIDELBERG tracked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, raced near the inside approaching the quarter pole,
angled out, drifted through the stretch run and kept on willing to the wire. TURN ON THE CHARM dropped back off the early pace, moved up from the
outside around the far turn, fanned eight deep into the lane and rallied gamely to the wire. ICE CUBE BABY was off slowly, coaxed along from the inside,
had to wait for room briefly while in tight near the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the inside throughout and flattened out late. TOUISSET pressed the
early leader from the outside and weakened. O SHAUGHESEY broke in, bumped with rival at the start, raced off the early pace setters, swung seven wide
into the lane and had no late rally. MOLLIE TAPPER was bumped, squeezed back at the break, hustled along to contention, was three deep near the
quarter pole and faded. PATRIA chased the pace from the outside and was done early.

NEOLITHICA was sent to a clear early lead, met bid by Boots's Merlot nearing the quarter pole, raced off the rail in the lane and held well to prove best
under strong handling. BOOTSY'S MERLOT tracked the pace settlers from the outside moved up three wide around the far turn, challenged near the
quarter pole, raced from the outside in the drive and kept on gamely to the wire. FLOGE was off slowly, rated along the inside under a hold, moved up late
to improve position while closing in mildly. MADE BIRDIE tracked the early leader two deep, swung six wide into the upper stretch and weakened through
the drive. VICTORIA'S DEVINE raced at the back of the pack early, was two to three deep around the far turn and had no response.

Footnotes
VICTIM OF THE NITE sent along to have a clear early lead, raced in hand through the far turn, asked near the three sixteenths pole and held well to prove
best under steady pressure. GRAND PICK was off a step slow, raced off the early going, moved up five to six wide into the upper stretch and finished
gamely to the wire. HIPPODROME stalked the pace, raced two wide around the far turn, was five deep near the three sixteenths pole and raced evenly late.
NEW YORK PANTHER stalked the pace between rivals and faded. ABUELO PAPS dropped back early, raced four to five wide around the far turn and
failed to threaten while racing from the outside. KERNESS was forwardly placed along the inside and tired readily.

steady handling. MARYLAND MOON settled off the early pace three deep, raced along the inside through the far turn, raced three to two wide in the drive
and rallied gamely for the place position. I WANNA ROCK raced in tight quarters early along the inside, continued an inside run around the far turn, eased
out into the upper stretch and weakened a bit late. HERE COMES RUSTY rated under a hold from the outside of rivals, raced four wide around the far turn
and was even with no closing run. GENERAL J R settled with the second flight early, raced three wide into the upper stretch and moved up by faders late.
POP SOCKS prompt the early leader from the outside and gave way in the drive. A THOUSAND IDOLS raced off the early pace, swung seven to eight wide
and had no late rally. BRIDGE TO SUCCESS was shuffled at the break, unhurried early on, raced seven deep into the upper stretch and never menaced.
MARVIN'S GRAY was bumped, off slowly, raced near the back early, was five wide around the far turn and never threatened. ANAHEIM void of early
speed, swung wide into the upper lane and never menaced. HEART OF FIRE stumbled badly at the start and was outrun. CRIPPLE CREEK was forwardly

EKATI'S VERVE settled off the early going to race in hand, moved up from the inside around the far turn, shifted five deep and finished well to edge clear
late under strong handling. TOP BOSS dueled for the early, raced clear through the far turn, narrowly lead near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly.
CHARGE TO VICTORY stalked the pace, took aim three deep into the upper stretch and was outkicked late. CAPTAIN CARDO lag early on, swung six
wide into the upper lane and closed in belatedly. VELVET GHOST stalked the pace in hand early, ridden near the three eighths pole near the rail and
weakened through the drive. MR. MOX dropped back early and failed to respond. MOCEPHUS was hard sent, dueled early and stopped.

Footnotes
REGALO prompt the early leader two deep from the outside of foe and finished well to draw clear under steady handling. MASAKADO set a pressured pace
from the inside of Regalo, dug in and narrowly held the place position in a game effort. PANDAGATE, squeezed back from between rivals soon after the
break, steadied off heels soon into the first turn, eased out and was rated between foes, came under pressure between runners leaving the far turn, worked
outward in the drive and finished well despite switching over to his left lead in the final yards. THEDINGOATEYOBABY tracked the early pair from the
inside, angled out in the stretch run and weakened. WAR MASTER was bumped at the start, raced in tight quarters into the first turn, raced at the back of
the pack early, swung eight wide into the upper lane and never threatened. IN THE DANCE was bumped at the start, settled off the early pace along the
inside and had no late rally. DANCE FOR GREEN was bumped at the start, ridden along two deep between near the three eighths pole and faded.
DERBYNESS raced five wide around the first turn, stalked the pace from the outside and faded. THENAME OF THEGAME stalked the pace three wide
between rivals and was empty near the quarter pole.

inside throughout and was even late with no closing run. DESTINED TO DANCE lag early on, raced three to four wide around the far turn and never
