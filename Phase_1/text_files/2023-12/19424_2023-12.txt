MISS LAUREN stalked the earlier pace from the three path, challenged leaving the three eighths pole, took the nod two deep past the five sixteenths and
was kept sharp in the stretch. PUSH rated the pace inside, was met past the three quarter pole and gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths, raced in the
three path on the far turn and came back to take second midway through the turn. HOW IS SHE settled in the three and four paths, gave chase from the
three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and came along for third mid-stretch. HERETODAYGONMANANA stalked from the three path, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. LIL SPINNER came away awkwardly and made
contact with Waverley then stalked off the rail, moved to even terms past the three quarter pole, dueled from the three eighths but was met leaving the five
sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened. CHANNEL SCENT settled off the pace toward the inside, eased out leaving the second turn and
showed little response through the backstretch. WAVERLEY was pinched back at the break and saved ground.

RIDICULOUS settled in the two and three paths, gave chase from the nine sixteenths pole and steadily improved through the backstretch, rounded the far
turn about the three path, dug in under steady stretch handling and got up the final yards. GRAN ANDREWS stalked inside, challenged approaching the
three eighths pole and drew to even terms at the pole, dueled clear midway on the far turn but was caught in the final yards. I AM THAT I AM stalked off the
rail, chased nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the stretch. GOODLUCKCHUCK angled in and rated the pace,
came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, was met at even terms at the pole and gave chase from that point, rounded the far turn at the rail
and weakened. CURLIN'S THRILL saved ground early and showed little. RAISE A SPEIGHTS stalked from the three path, picked up the chase toward the
seven sixteenths pole but bobbled approaching the quarter and was eased.

extended it further under steady stretch handling. IT'S MY RAINBOW gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and held on for
second. STREET TOUGH exchanged contact with CALCULATED LUV leaving the gate then gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail and ran evenly in the
stretch. The latter exchanged contact with Street Tough leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and finished
evenly. BROWN SUGA BABE was not a factor. HEY BOOTS became fractious and sat down in the gate, pressured the pace inside through the

BLUE HOUR took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rated the early pace, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths, widened at the rail
on the turn and was steadily handled in the lane. EVERYDAYISAGIFT chased through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn then eased out entering
the stretch and dug in to take second late yards. PRINCESS MIA ROSE gave early chase toward mid track, raced three wide on the turn and finished
evenly to take third the final stride. SILVER'S GIRL had a brief early lead then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn and
flattened later yards. SONGTELLER chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail and showed little in the lane. HEY MACARENA gave chase outside, raced in
the five path on the turn and showed little in the lane. DEAREST M. A. chased toward the outside, raced in the six path on the turn and proved empty in the
lane. SHESARUNAWAYTRAIN saved ground.
