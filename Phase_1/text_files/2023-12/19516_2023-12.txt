Footnotes
FIGHT'N READY unhurried in the early going just off the inside, continued two wide into the far turn, circled four wide into contention turning for home,
challenged nearing the furlong grounds while drifting in a bit, going away at the end. MO MOVES pressed the leader from the two path, advanced and took
over in the far turn, briefly offered some resistance to the winner approaching midstretch, proved no match for that one late. STRICKLAND broke back,
trailed in lacking any early foot, angled three wide into the stretch, lodged a belated rally to annex the show not a threat to the top two. DR. WOODS
MIRACLE off a step slow, lacked speed off the inside, floated four wide into the lane, improved position without posing a serious threat. MY BROTHER
MIKE settled off the pace and the inside, came up empty for the stretch run. SHAMEFUL ALLIANCE away in good order, cleared to the inside to set the
pace, continued to show the way up the backstretch, began to falter when headed far turn. LUCKY SUPER NOVA within striking distance for five furlongs,
little left. MORE MONEY MO weakened after a half.

Footnotes
IAN GLASS close up from the start, advanced to challenge outside the leader in the turn, showed the way into the stretch, shook clear past the furlong
marker and increased advantage under steady handling. WHOOPING JAY broke sharp, clear early, set the pace inside, could not match strides with the
winner the final turn, proved game for the place. CAMPISI back off the pace and the inside, closer four to three wide turn, lodged a late bid for the place
outside the runner up, outfinished for that position while saving the show between foes at the wire. WILDWOOD MINISTRY away in good order, went one
paced toward the inside, moved out a bit, mild late interest to miss the show. BLACK STORM in tight, bothered at the start, raced back early, four wide into
the lane, improved position. MORNING SNOW in mid pack and off the inside, in some traffic turning for home, went evenly through the lane. COLOR FAST
lacked speed, continued to lag into the stretch, improved through and around traffic. SQUARE DEAL in the main body outside, four wide through the turn,
failed to rally. TRAPPE VALLEY in tight, bothered at the break, raced inside turn, picked off some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. CABOT
fractious in the gate prior to the start, saved ground to no avail. BAYRON broke out, bothered a couple of outer rivals, lacked speed, faded through the lane.
STRINGS broke in, was straightened to race forwardly placed in traffic into the turn, began to back up soon after.

BACK TO OHIO broke with field, vied up front toward the inside, disposed of the other speed inside the furlong marker and drove clear. LEELOO in mid
pack early while outside, three to four wide for the drive, finished willingly while too late. BOW DRAW forwardly placed along the inside, lacked a significant
closing response to finish best of the rest. CHANDANA back off the pace while also saving ground, went evenly through the lane, not enough for the show.
CONNIE K pressed outside, continued to apply pressure to the winner through the turn and into the stretch, gave way final furlong. LOVER GIRL broke
back, raced back and inside, picked off some tiring rivals while not a threat. DEALING JUSTICE last to leave, made little impact off the inside. PROMISES
TO DANCE forwardly placed, shuffled back with four furlongs remaining, faded. SUMMER SHOES raced back, five wide into the lane, remained always
back.

Footnotes
CHIP SHORTAGE broke on top, set the pace in the two path, continued to show the way into the lane, drew away the final furlong. LIL GIN N CLASS
prompted the issue early inside, moved closer turning for home while continuing along the rail, altered course to the outside a furlong out, clearly second
best. BIG BOLT pressed the issue while outside the winner, three wide through the turn, could do little with that one in the drive or the runner up,
comfortably finished best of the rest. GLOBAL RISK in the second flight while racing outside, went evenly through the stretch. KAT'N CHROME floated in at
the break, raced in mid pack off the inside, came three wide for the drive, not dangerous in the run to the wire. BABE IN THE WOODS four wide trip,
improved position slightly while also not posing a serious threat. ERUMPENT floated in at the start, saved ground early turn, two path into the lane, did not
menace. BABAS GAL floated in at the break, void of speed, remained back. COLLIER three to four wide through the turn, was not a factor. COWGIRL
CAMILLE broke in, was finished early to trail home.

QUEEN behind the pace toward the inside early, steadied in tight quarters early in the turn, continued to save ground, squeezed through a narrow opening
into the lane, rail bid past the furlong marker, briefly led late, could not contain the winner. BANG BANG FURY settled off the pace, in some traffic early turn,
came three wide for the drive, challenged with a furlong to run, flattened out in the late going. CLEOPATRA SELENE pressed the issue early challenged
three wide turning for home, drifted in to brush with SPIRITUAL LADY soon after, weakened. SPIRITUAL LADY set or forced the early pace, was weakening
when brush between horses midstretch, continued to give way. TALE OF LA BEE broke well, narrowly set the pace for four furlongs toward the inside,
faltered when straightened for home. ARIJANA'S PEARL was never dangerous while racing in the two path. CATHOLIC SUE remained back while racing
three wide. SAFECRACKER SUE was always back. THE BIG CALHOUNA hesitated at the break, moved up to race in mid pack, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
WICKED AGAIN prompted the pace four wide up the backstretch and into the turn, challenged three wide when straightened for home, shook clear late then
held the next two safe late under firm handling. MILLERS RITE bumped at the break then got out, void if any early foot, two path through the turn, eased out
a bit for the stretch run, closed with good resolve to be rapidly getting to the winner late while between horses at the wire. MR. KEATING lacked speed,
three wide out of the turn, rallied and also was going well at the end although was outkicked for the second spot. RAGING broke in, bumped with the runner
up, carried out by that one, moved up to race forwardly late backstretch, challenged soon after and dueled through the turn, gained a brief advantage
between calls in upper stretch but could not last. XCELLENT MEN in mid pack off the rail, had little left for the drive. PINELAND failed to seriously menace
while four wide. TRABR'S CREED fractious in the gate prior to the start, away forwardly, set pace for a half inside, gave way. KANT CONQUER ME broke
through the gate prior to the start twice, away well, vied for a half, stopped.

Footnotes
WAR CAMPAIGN tracked the pace firmly in hand and along the rail, crept a bit closer into the far turn, lodged a rail bid soon after under clever handling,
took over, clear while drifting out past the furlong marker, held sway to the wire under steady handling. SPEED BIAS away in good order, stalked the issue
three wide, remained in good position through the final turn, lacked a winning punch while remaining outside. STRONG QUALITY broke well, showed the
way in the two path, gave up the rail to the winner in the second turn, gradually weakened, lasted for the show. SEIZE THE NIGHT settled off the pace three
wide, turn in an even effort, lacked a closing kick. DENINGTON last away, continued to lack speed, moved out four wide when making a mild advance
second turn, flattened out in the drive. DOUBLE CROWN finished after a half, gave way, well back.

Footnotes
RIVERCREST GIRL void of early foot off the inside, swung out six wide exiting the turn, finished full of run down the middle of the strip to be in time. ONE
WAY OR ANOTHER in the second flight under firm restraint and in the two path, dropped to the inside late turn, rail bid, led late, could not contain the
winner. LASSIE MY GIRL brush start, lacked speed along the inside, improved into the lane, not enough late for the place. HAMAZING DEBATE lacked
speed, came five wide into the stretch, staged a mild rally to get a share. SASSY LASS fell back to trail after the start, saved ground through the turn,
improved position without posing a serious threat. MOCHA KISS in a bit tight at the break, went one paced while racing toward the inside. TIMBAVATI broke
well despite a brush, dueled up front along the inside, faltered. GOLD STRATEGY off step slow, moved up to mid pack while three wide, proceeded evenly.
MUSIC MISTRESS settled off the pace. FLY LIKE THE WIND tired while racing three to four wide through the turn. NIGHT ORB pressured the pace while
three wide for a half and gave way. MISSY PIGGY in mid pack in the early going, steadily faded.
