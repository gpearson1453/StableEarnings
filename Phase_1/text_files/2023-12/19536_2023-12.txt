Footnotes
REPLETE ran on the outside in the four path then coming on to the stretch on the outside had a strong closing drive to take the win. BURNZ DA BOSS ran
in the back of the pack then with a steady gain made their way thru the pack and got place. GOGO OXBOW started in the front of the pack then shuffled
back on the inside and had late kick in the final furlong. FOLLOW THE FACTS ran with good early speed getting the first call by a half length, then flattened
out late. SHARP WARNING flew from the gates but lacked the speed to maintain the lead and shuffled back. AUTISM WARRIOR set the pace going around
the turn then faded at the eighth pole. PLAYING FIELD trailed throughout.
