Footnotes
CLASS CLOWN chased briefly then went up to duel from outside, put away inner rival past the three-eighths pole, opened up when roused in the lane, grew
a bit weary late but held safely. DIAMONDS DANZING settled off the inside, went three wide into the turn, angled five wide leaving the bend, showed late
effort and whittle the gap on the winner while gaining the place. KO OLINA bumped with inner rival leaving the gate, stepped to the front then dueled inside
CLASS CLOWN, could not keep pace with that rival with three furlongs left to run, churned on down the stretch and managed to hold the show. SHE'S
BULLETPROOF tracked from inside, trailed two wide into the lane, angled out in the lane and kept on for a minor award. SHANGHAI SUNRISE chased
three deep into and around the bend, came four wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. BROKEN CIRCLE stumbled and bumped at the start, stalked
between rivals two to three wide on the turn and weakened down the lane. WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE stalked on the inside, shifted to the two path on the
turn and also weakened. PALEO'S PRINCESS stumbled in the beginning, chased five then six wide and failed to menace.

Footnotes
CREATIVE WAY sped to the front from inside while under pressure, cleared on the backstretch, challenged again on the far turn, lost command at the top of
the lane, fought back gamely and gained command nearing the eighth pole, then drew clear in the final sixteenth. PLAY CHICKEN pressed from outside
early then chased up the backstretch, bid outside on the far turn, took over at the top of the lane, dueled with CREATIVE WAY down the lane and faltered
late. DERECHO DANDY chased three wide off the pace early, went three deep on the far turn, bumped outer rival in upper stretch, came with a late run but
needed to find more. TIZ TOK stalked two to three wide early, four deep on the second bend, bumped with DERECHO DANDY in upper stretch and finished
evenly late. NOBLE UNION stalked on the inside then moved off the rail on the clubhouse turn, chased two wide into the lane and lacked the needed
response. RELAXED ARTIST (IRE) hit the gate and came away slow, tucked inside at the back, made progress along the rail on the far turn but flattened
down the lane. TOO MUCH INFO up close early in the four path, chased three wide on the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
GEEZER broke in and bumped GRAZED, vied three deep between early then chased the top pair leaving the backstretch, rounded the bend three then four
wide, launched a bid from outside with a furlong remaining, took over shortly after and held over SPIRITUAL ADVISOR in the final moments. SPIRITUAL
ADVISOR vied four deep and between foes early then chased the dueling leaders into the turn, drifted out to bump rival at the three-eighths pole, came
three wide into the lane, moved in and rallied inside the leaders in deep stretch but ran out of time. GRAZED bumped with the winner at the start, fought for
the lead between rivals then dueled outside a rival into the turn, battled three wide into the lane, put away inner rival midstretch but was soon challenged by
GEEZER at the eighth pole, relinquished the lead shortly after but stayed on to the wire. DISKO TRIBUTE vied six deep early then chased four deep into the
turn, got bumped into outer rival at the three-eighths pole, came five wide into the stretch and finished evenly. ON THE WHIM raced up close seven deep
then chased five deep leaving the backstretch, got bumped at the three-eighths pole, exited the bend six wide and lacked a rally. CRIBBAGE BOARD vied
inside several rivals then dueled with GRAZED, fought two wide into the drive, stayed on to midstretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. MEESH vied
four deep between rivals then ceded command and angled to the inside for the turn but failed to respond when called upon. STAY IN THE GAME trailed off
the rail into the turn, moved out and came seven wide into the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HABEAS pressed from inside early, challenged and took over into the turn, held a short lead two wide into the lane, put away COOL PAPA G in upper
stretch, fought with LONESOME STEW and disposed of that rival past the eighth pole, then drew away in the final sixteenth. BLUE CHEESE OLIVE stalked
from inside, hugged the rail to the stretch and got up for second. LONESOME STEW chased four wide into the turn, bid three deep at the five-sixteenths
pole, fought to the furlong marker and could not kick on with the winner after. COOL PAPA G set the pace under pressure early, dueled outside HABEAS
into and around the turn, could not keep pace with that rival in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. AMIGO G A trailed two wide into the turn, four
wide into the lane and failed to menace.

lane but remained well clear to the wire. SWIFT NONNI broke a step slow, trailed on the inside then shifted to the two path on the turn, summoned a mild
rally and gained second. BARBERA shifted in leaving the gate, chased two to three wide and lacked a bid. YOUR RINGER tracked outside rivals into the
turn, spun six wide into the lane and failed to menace. MANGO MOON bobbled a bit at the start, got brushed by SHE'S RESILIENT early, showed speed
then chased two into the turn, raced bit off the rail into the lane and weakened. SHE'S RESILIENT hit the gate and bobbled, brushed inner rival early,
chased three wide then angled out to enter the lane in the five path but had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MEMORIES stalked from inside then moved into the two path, roused still two wide on the far turn, angled to the outside of DESERT DAWN
past the three-sixteenths pole, drew alongside with a sixteenth remaining and inched away late. DESERT DAWN stalked in the three path outside a rival
early, bid three deep on the far turn, dueled four wide into the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch, began to drift in and was put to left handed urging,
remained clear at the eighth pole, challenged by MIDNIGHT MEMORIES with a sixteenth to go and yielded to the winner. TURNERLOOSE became rank
chasing off the inside approaching the clubhouse turn then drifted out a bit around the bend, stalked up the backstretch, chased two, three then four wide on
the far turn, moved out in the lane and gained the show. GANADORA prompted the pace from outside, moved up on even terms in the middle stages,
inched ahead at the three furlong pole, fought inside DESERT DAWN three wide into the lane, relinquished the lead at the top of the stretch and weakened
in the late stages. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH tucked inside at the back, moved off the rail and went three wide on the far turn, angled out at the top of the lane
and failed to threaten. TROUVILLE coaxed along early near the back, got floated out to the four path by TURNERLOOSE on the first turn, chased in range
four then five wide on the far turn but flattened down the lane. VIOLENT RUNNER took control early from inside while under pressure, came off the rail
around the clubhouse turn and went three wide into the backstretch, headed by outer rival in the middle stages, lost command and failed to keep up with
outer rival approaching the five-sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive.
