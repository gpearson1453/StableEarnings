Footnotes
SUNYANI broke sharply taking control clearing to the rail loose on the lead down the back straight, was unchallenged setting the pace through the turn and
had something left in reserve to draw off easily for the well rated tally. MANETKA settled on the inside in the third flight at the half, was scrubbed on for more
run midway on the turn, rallied smartly on the fence in upper stretch and closed belatedly to be second best behind the runaway winner. BROTHER BELEN
hopped slightly on the break, co-trailed on the outside in the early going, advanced four wide around horses at the three furlong marker and willingly fought
on in the four path down the stretch to get third money at the wire. STREET SERENADE was unhurried co-trailing on the inside down the backstretch,
closed the gap on rivals saving ground on the rail through the turn, shifted outside with run under left handed urging at the furlong pole and up at the wire to
capture a minor share in the end. AMAZON FORESTER was content to track the loose pacesetter down the backstretch, chased the frontrunning winner in
vain around the turn, battled for the runner up share in upper stretch and faded at the seventy yard pole losing placings late. DISCOVERY CHART stalked
on the the outside in the third flight down the backside, improved when roused three wide at the three furlong marker, had a chance for a share in the three
path in upper stretch, could not go on and levelled out at the furlong pole. JACK travelled in midfield between runners down the backstretch, made little
impression inside throughout the turn and lacked a rally in the stretch run. DIXIE'S FLATTER stalked near the rear in the early going, could not keep up with
others running around the bend and had nothing to give in the drive down the stretch.

Footnotes
KANTBACKOFF settled into stride off the leaders, moved out a bit early on the turn and began to advance willingly, was guided five wide past the quarter
pole rapidly moving on the leaders, struck the lead in upper stretch while lugging in a bit, was in hand through the final furlong and ridden out.
DANZIGQUEEN eased back off the leading trio to track in behind, raced mostly in the three path moving out a bit early on the turn and under urging from
past the seven-sixteenths, had late effort to secure the place while no threat to the winner. CRASH THE CREASE raced inside at the back, saved ground,
advanced inside till the sixteenth pole then moved out off the rail to pass and get up for show honors late. SPEEDY BUBBLES moved forward inside
runners to force the issue, vied inside through the turn drifting out a bit turning for home with a narrow lead, was soon overtaken, drifted back to the rail in
mid-stretch and had no extra. PROUD SPEAKER was bumped at the break, had forward position prompting the pace outside into the turn racing three
deep, floated five wide into upper stretch, was placed in tight quarters as the leader lugged in, failed to rally. MORAL TURPITUDE bumped a rival at the
start, raced outside at the back two to three wide into and on the turn, swung out five wide turning for home then was guided out further, failed to menace.
SILVER BULLET LADY shot to a narrow early lead but was soon joined by foes inside and outside, contended between runners, drifted out a bit leaving the
turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
PRINCESS MAYFAIR had a narrow advantage on the inside down the backstretch, continued to set the pace while shadowed outside around the oval, was
stubbornly clinging onto the lead at the top of the stretch, put away the early speed foe by mid-stretch, braced for the new challenge from the closers at the
eighth pole, rider lost hos crop when encouraged left handed at the sixteenth pole but tenaciously held on for the score. WHY EM SEA AY tracked the front
pair three wide outside runners down the backside, inched closer three wide outside measuring the dueling leaders around the turn, loomed boldly in the
three path turning for home, was gaining on the leader with each stride down the lane but could not find enough late and just missed in a photo for the win.
MO'S VINO MESA had a good spot nestled on the rail watching the engaged duo down the backside, took closer order on the rail patiently waiting for her
cue to go, lacked running room at the top of the stretch behind the contesting leaders, shifted outside finding a seam in the three path at the eighth [ole and
closed in sharply but by that time it was too late. MAXIMUM FIFTY pressed the pace outside down the backstretch, hounded the frontrunning winner outside
through the turn, battled for the lead in the two path with rivals on each side in upper stretch, could not find more late and faded in the final sixteenth to the
wire. YOUSANGTOME was off slowly to trail down the back straight, showed a mild run passing rivals at the three eighths pole but could not gain on the
dueling front quartet down the lane. SILENT PRINCESS had a slow start to begin, having only another poor starter beaten down the backside, could not
gain on challengers through the turn and was not involved in the drive to the finish line. AMONG THE ROSES broke outwards on the break, tracked
between rivals in the second flight in the early going, could not match strides with others at the seven sixteenths marker, could see the field around the bend
and was not persevered with in the final furlong.

Footnotes
HITS DIFFERENT settled off the pace racing off the inside in the three path, moved nearer the rail biding time well back, put to urging about the
five-sixteenths, fanned five wide into upper stretch, struck the lead just past the furlong marker and drew clear. FOXY DIVA broke a step slowly, settled
toward the rear and inside, saved ground, rallied inside into upper stretch making a mild bid in mid-stretch but was outkicked. GREAT KATE moved out on
the first turn racing off the pace in about the three to four path, kept on evenly late. BEDAZZLE ME settled outside a foe two to three wide at the back early,
fanned six wide into the stretch, kicked on mildly. SEATTLE CAUSEWAY settled into stride racing well back of the loose leader, edged nearer on the far turn
taking the lead briefly in upper stretch but lacked any late kick. QUEEN GYPSY lacked early speed, failed to menace. WELL ACTUALLY quickly made the
lead, sped clear, opened up a wide lead up the backstretch, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
PRIMA tracked the frontrunner outside down the backside, chased the pacesetter in the turn, began to close in on the leader in mid-stretch and
determinedly found more between runners in the final furlong to get up just before the wire for the hard earned victory. HOLIDAY IN JAIL sat alone in
midfield down the backside, began to pick up runners two wide outside foes at the three furlong pole, posed a threat in the three path straightening out for
the drive and gamely battled with rivals while on the wrong lead in the stretch to the finish line. DESTIN NIGHT took control clearing from the outside to lead
comfortably on the rail down the back straight, continued up top setting the pace around the bend, was clinging onto the lead on the fence at the eighth pole,
drifted outwards under left handed urging driving to the wire at the seventy yard pole and faded late to be a clear third at the line. ROYAL RIBBON stalked
near the back on the rail in the early going, took closer order in the third flight running easily in the turn, shifted outside gaining momentum four wide at the
quarter pole, was in range outside of the leaders at the top of the stretch and ran on mildly to the wire to settle on the fringes. NIKITA'S GEM dwelt at the
start spotting the field many lengths down the backside, caught up to the field, actually passing a rival outside at the quarter pole and finished up well down
the stretch with all things considered from the poor start. MRS. HOT SHOT stalked near the rear down the backstretch, made little progress on horses
through the turn and was not a presence in the stretch drive. SILENT PASSION tracked the leader on the inside down the back straight, was asked to keep
up on the fence three furlongs remaining, offered little run and backed away on the rail through the turn and galloped across the wire.

Footnotes
CLASSY IMAGE was quick to lead, set the pace in the clear, was challenged in upper stretch and headed in mid-stretch, fought back and got the nod. RED
ENSIGN broke outwardly lightly bumping a rival, tracked in behind the leader inside, tipped out commending a move late on the turn, bid and took a narrow
lead in upper- to mid-stretch, dueled to the wire, lost the nod. DYNAMIC STRIKE settled off the pace outside, moved outside a rival three wide on the turn,
floated out a path into upper stretch, ran on. CRAFTY OAKS pursued the eventual winner from outside a foe two to three wide, dropped back between
runners on the turn, failed to rally. CANTUCCI broke outwardly, angled in racing inside foes into the turn, was guided out to about the three path midway on
that bend, came out further for the drive and ran on. KATHERINE'S GEM was lightly bumped at the start, moved forward inside racing within striking
distance late on the turn, flattened out. IM A SOUPERMAN was just a bit hard to control early racing well off the inside, went two to three wide through the
turn, failed to rally. WHO'S THAT BABY raced outside at the back going three to four wide on the turn, was never a threat.

Footnotes
TRADING BAY emerged with a clear lead separating from the pack at the five eighths marker, was comfortable up front unopposed through the turn, burst
away from the chasing runners when set down in mid-stretch and cruised home for an impressive front running tally. TOERIS stalked near the rear three
deep down the backside, offered a bold move swooping four wide around horses at the quarter pole, loomed the main threat in the six path at the top of the
stretch, was not match for the winner to the wire but bested the rest at the wire. A GAME was tucked in on the rail tracking the front pair down the
backstretch, kept pace with the leaders travelling smartly on the fence around the bend and gamely fought on through the stretch on the fence to win the
show battle in the end. SILKEN DOLLAR chased the winner outside in the early stages of the race, loomed outside in the four path straightening out for
home, faded between foes dueling for the place share at the furlong marker and settled on the fringes in the end. I'M INTO MISCHIEF had rivals on either
side tracking the top duo under a snug hold at the half, was shuffled back in tight quarters midturn and finished up with intent reaching for ground in the last
furlong. MRS. GREEN had a rail stalking role having one runners beaten down the backside, waited for running room on the fence throughout the turn and
was one paced behind horses in the stretch drive. GLORIANNIA was allowed to settle seeing the field down the backstretch, saved ground inside seeing the
pack around the bend, swung outside widest in the six path at the top of the lane and passed weary foes in the stretch. BREATHING FIRE broke in a tangle
to begin, recovered to track the top pair three wide between rivals at the half, came under a hard ride midway on the turn, could not keep up with others and
weakened in upper stretch. CURLIN CANDY bobbled on the start, regrouped to settle in mid-pack four deep down the backstretch, offered a brief run three
wide outside foes at the three furlong marker until the quarter pole running five wide and gave way in mid-stretch.

FRAC DANCER was urged at the break but soon joined by an inside foe, dueled with that one till the furlong marker then edged clear, held from a
late-closing MIDNIGHT MASCOT, who settled inside at the rear, advanced inside rivals on the turn, came out in mid-stretch, rallied strongly but too late.
GUN COURT settled outside at the rear, fanned five wide into the stretch, gained too late but just got up for show over GAROFOLI, who stalked from
outside runners mid-pack racing mostly four wide, kept on evenly in the stretch. COMPETITIVE TOUCH moved forward inside, dueled, faded in the final
furlong. MEKO MAKEE chased from inside and off the rail on the turn, faded. COOLER MAN chased briefly two to three wide from between runners,
dropped back.

Footnotes
SHAMANS GIRL was forced back at the start to trail, patiently settled into stride down the backstretch, began to close the gap on rivals on the turn, rallied
three wide at the quarter pole, pounced to the lead at the furlong marker, switched leads and impressively drew away in deep stretch. VANDOO settled in
midfield two wide outside of runners down the back straight, rallied three wide circling foes at the quarter pole, loomed four wide straightening out for the
drive, was no match for the winner in the final eighth and stubbornly held on to be second best at the finish. LITTLE TEDDY travelled in mid-pack on the rail
in the early going, progressed smartly on the fence at the quarter pole, was in the thick of things in the three path at the top of the lane and finished up
solidly to the line just missing the place share crossing the wire. RED ELEANOR broke in sharply at the start, stalked near the rear on the rail down the
backside, saved ground inching closer around the oval, drifted outwards through the lane driving to the wire and closed in late for a minor role in the end.
ONELLA was hustled on the break to get the lead on the rail by the half mile marker, opened on the pack through the turn, was asking for the wire narrowly
holding onto the lead inside at the furlong pole and tired in deep stretch. MASTER ARAGORN broke alertly to have the lead in the beginning, was relegated
to track the frontrunner down the backstretch, chased in vain the pacesetter around the bend, was nudged for more between foes at the quarter pole, had
nothing to offer and yielded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
WICKED MERCURY was part of the quintuplet tracking the front two leaders at the half, pounced smartly three wide taking control at the quarter pole,
opened up convincingly in upper stretch and was kept to the task to win going away at the finish line. KITTEN'S ROMANCE could see this compact field
down the backside, angled out in hand three wide moving boldly around horses at the quarter pole, posed the only threat in the five path at the top of the
lane but could not reel in the winner who had lots left through the stretch. GIZMO'S B F F watched the front pair between horses down the backstretch,
could not maintain position and was shuffled back at the seven sixteenths marker, angled three wide in upper stretch, found her best stride late and closed
in to win the battle for third in a photo. LOIS LEN sat behind the front two between foes in the three path down the backstretch, lost positioning with horses
on either side around the turn, recovered five wide turning for home and showed good late energy fighting for third money down the stretch, just missing in a
photo at the wire. CEFALO tracked the top two on the rail down the backstretch, rated kindly behind the early pacesetter waiting for room behind foes on the
turn, shifted out off the tiring leader at the quarter pole, battled gamely on the fence to the wire and just lost the duel for the show award. BLAZING SKY was
five deep on the outside on runners having one rival beaten at the half, offered a brief run five wide outside rivals at the three eighths marker until the to of
the lane, was in the mix turning for home but flattened out nearing the sixteenth pole. SILENT GUROO took this field down the backstretch, opened up
mildly on the field in midturn, was collared outside by the winner at the quarter pole, offered no resistance and retreated on the fence in mid-stretch. LADY
IN RED prompted the pace outside down the backstretch, chased the pacesetter on the turn, could not find more midway on the turn, was engulfed at the
quarter pole and nothing to offer in upper stretch.
