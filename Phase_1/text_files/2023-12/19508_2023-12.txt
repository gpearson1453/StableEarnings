for the top two. CHEROKEE SUMMER raced in the back of the pack and passed tired ones. CHEER UP pressed the early pace, faded and was no threat
late. SADIE'S RANSOM lacked early speed and was never close.

MUFFIN NUTS void of early speed, saved ground around the final turn, made a late rail bid and proved the best late. INDIMAAJ pressed the pace, saved
ground around the final turn, drove clear down the home stretch, but couldn't hold off MUFFDIN NUTS for the win. OAK HILL LG broke a step slow, racing
in the rear, moved up, came around the first turn six wide, moved up on the outside around the second turn, gained ground, but proved no match for the top
two today. FAR BEYOND pressed the pace, weakened and was outfinished for show. AUTOPILOT lacked early speed, came around the second turn wide,
showed late interest, but was no factor. MR. FOUR SEVENS raced within contention, came around the first turn four wide, faded, put forth an even effort
and lacked a late kick. WAR RON showed early speed, dropped back, came around the final turn wide and was no threat late. STATE OF THE UNION
lacked early speed, came around the first turn five wide and was never a threat. I WILL STAND flashed brief speed, dropped back and was outrun.

MOON TIME went to the front, led throughout, saved ground, pulled away and won under steady urging. BAYOU CHROME raced within striking distance,
had an outside trip, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. BRIARTOWN pressed the pace, raced outside around the first
turn, forwardly placed throughout and was caught late for second. GHOST COWBOY raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. PRESUMPTIVE
CLOSER raced within contention, saved ground around the second turn and was finished early. NAPOLEONIC CODE vied for the early advantage and
faded. LOST GOLD always raced near the back and showed little. QUIET AS MIDNIGHT void of early speed, pulled up around the final turn and was

Footnotes
FRENCH COMPOSER sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout, pulled away and won handily. WISE VERDICT raced within contention, forwardly
placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. GRAVES MILL ROAD unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside
around the second turn, made a mild bid, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. LIMONITE void of early speed, saved ground around the
final turn, moved up, but was no factor. MINNESOTA MIRACLE pressed the early pace, saved ground around the final turn and faded. HARD ATTACK void
of early speed, raced outside around the second turn and was never a threat. MOTAWAAFEQ pressed the early pace and was finished early.

Footnotes
OUR HALLIE went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and held on well for the win. TWISTED BRADE pressed the pace, raced close throughout and
followed the winner to the wire. TALKABOUT raced within contention, saved ground around the final turn and proved no match for the top two. ABBEY
CAKES raced in the middle of the field, came around the second turn on the outside, moved up and finished evenly. SLIM CAUSEWAY raced in the back of
the pack, improved position, but was no factor. AD LIBITUM void of early speed and was never close. TIME TO CLOSE lacked early speed, had a wide trip
and was never a threat. SHE'S THE SHERIFF showed early speed, dropped back and was outrun.
