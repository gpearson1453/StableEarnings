Footnotes
FALFURRIAS settled off the pace inside, angled four wide turning for home, kicked in outside, took over near the sixteenth pole and powered clear.
MARCEAU stalked the pace in the three path, bid nearing the quarter pole, vied outside of THEMANUPFRONT from there to the sixteenth pole, edged
ahead of that foe but was no match for the winner late. THEMANUPFRONT set the pace the pace in the two path, was collared near the eighth pole and
kept on well enough to save the show. TOUR THE CITY raced off the pace two wide and improved position in the lane. MY LIFE STORY tracked the pace
four wide and tired in the lane. NEVER SAY NEVER chased the pace two and three wide and lacked a closing bid. HOMER JONES was bumped at the
start, raced off the pace four and five wide, lugged in in the stretch and never threatened. RED ABARRIO raced up close inside and came up empty in the
lane. REGGAE MAN failed to menace while racing three and four wide. CRYSTAL QUEST broke awkwardly and bumped a foe at the start, raced three
wide and played no further factor. CRYPTONYM trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
LE MISTRAL rated in the two path, tipped out to the six path under coaxing early around the turn, swung from the eight path into the lane, rallied past an
inner trio passing the eighth pole, and went clear under a drive. THAT MAGIC MOMENT led in the opening quarter, was passed by an inner foe around the
five-eighths and pressed in the five path thereafter, took aim from the six path turning into the stretch. and kept on for place. RING FUND vied for the lead in
the three path, took a clear advantage going into the turn, but lost the lead between foes nearing the quarter, cut the corner into the stretch, and finished
evenly for show. BAD HOMBRE stalked in the four path, slipped thru an opening along the rail to take a short lead nearing the quarter, tipped out to the four
path at the top of the stretch, but faded. BEE A SKY BEAM had a slow start, raced off the pace inside, floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, and
did not factor. DANCING BULLET brushed with an inner foe at the start, was wellback in the five path and eased going into the stretch. SLEIPNIR brushed
with an outer foe at the start, chased in the six path but never menaced.

Footnotes
LIBBAN set the pace well off the rail, was content to stalk when FLAKES moved to the front midway down the backstretch, re-bid in three path nearing the
the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. ROSIE'S HALO raced off the pace five wide and ran on to gain the place late. FLAKES was bumped at
the start, vied inside of the winner in the two path and weakened through the final furlong. RIDING PRETTY hesitated at the start, advanced three wide
around the turn, angled further out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. STARSHIP AGENDA was bumped at the start, chased
the pace from the rail and lacked a closing bid. EMPRESS ELLIE tracked the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
PERFECTLY MPERFECT stalked in the four path, bid in the two path early into the far turn, took the lead midway around the far turn, went back out to the
four path entering the stretch, and was driven clear. SPANISH GIRL raced in midpack in the four path, was coaxed into the far turn, took aim from the six
path at the top of the lane, and chased on for place. GLOSSY LIFE rated in the five path, moved up under a drive in the four path around the far turn, swung
from the six path into the stretch, but evened out for show. NEW BABY broke in at the start, trailed along the inside, fanned out to the nine path turning into
the stretch, but made no impact. KIKI got fractious and broke thru the gate, tracked in the two path, was ridden into the far turn, floated out to the seven path
at the top of the stretch, and flattened. LADY BONHEUR popped the gate door open as an inner foe was extremely fractious, chased in the three path but
did not threaten. SHE LOVES TO MOVE pressed in the two path, took over the lead nearing the half, but gaveway along the inside turning into the stretch.
TIME MISS brushed the rail and steadied slightly early into the first turn, moved up to lead along the inside turning into the backstretch, but lost the lead
passing the half, and backed up around the far turn.

FAMOUS GENT brushed with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the four path, was coaxed in the three path midway around the turn, swung out to the five
path turning into the stretch, and rallied past an inner duo in the closing stages. COMPETITIVE SAINT prompted the pace in the three path, bid in the two
path around the turn, ran on to take the lead just before the eighth pole, but was caught in the final sixteenth by an outer foe to place. CAJUN BROTHER set
the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside into the turn, dug in turning into the stretch, lost the lead and began to fade just before the eighth pole,
and just held on to show. KING JAMES brushed with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the three path, shifted out to the six path under a drive
turning into the lane, stayed on while remaining on his left lead down the lane, but just missed getting up for show. TAP EM rated between foes in the two
path early but did not factor. QUINCY CAFE stalked inside but backed up around the turn.

and edged ahead late. GOODBETTERBEST tracked the pace four wide, bid nearing the five-sixteenths marker, dueled outside of the winner from there to
deep stretch and was outfinished. CONFER raced off the pace two wide, steadied early on the backstretch, continued off the pace inside around the far
turn, tipped out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and was along for the show. ROSY TOMORROWS failed to menace while racing
three and four wide. QUEEN DEYMAR played no factor while racing two and three wide. MISS UCRANIA was outrun while racing two and three wide and
swinging widest in upper stretch. ALWAYS ROYAL hit the starting gate, chased the pace inside and faded through the lane. SEEKINGBYTHESTORM set

Footnotes
PURE CLASS was hustled from up close in the two path, brushed with an outer foe while tipping out to the three path at the top of the lane, bid passing the
eighth pole, and went clear under a drive in the final sixteenth. STARSHIP MOCHA raced off the pace in the two path, was ridden from the rail into the
stretch, tipped out to the three path passing the eighth pole, and ran on between for place. GOES THE CLOWN tracked in the five path, brushed with the
inner eventual winner while in the four path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly for show. VALUED CAJUN set the pace in the two path, was
challenged while along the inside turning into the stretch, and faded in the final furlong. SMOKIN JACK FLASH prompted the pace in the three path, bid
from the two path turning into the lane, stuck his head in front while still on his left lead passing the eighth pole, but weakened between foes late. FORT
CHARLES chased in the six path, ranged up in the four path around the turn, but retreated in the six path entering the stretch. KUWAIT TOWERS steadied
just after the start, trailed in the two path and never threatened. HEATHCLIFF stalked in the four path but backed up early into the turn.

Footnotes
CHOOSE JOY chased in the four path, swung out to the six path under a drive turning into the lane, stayed on while drifting in on her left lead, and drew
past the outer pacesetter in the closing stages. RUN FOR THE HILLS set the pace in the three path, kicked away while floating out to the five path entering
the stretch, but was caught late by an inner foe to place. PLAY THE MUSIC raced off the pace in the two path, angled outward rounding the turn, and kept
on from the nine path down the lane for show. HIT THE WOAH trailed along the inside, shifted out to the five path turning into the lane, rallied between foes,
and just missed minor placings. FUTURE IS NOW pressed in the four path but faded in the final furlong. LEAVE NO TRACE was hustled in range from the
three path, floated out to the five path around the turn, and made no impact from the seven path in the stretch. ISABEL ALEXANDRA (IRE) raced in
midpack along the inside but did not factor. ONE IDENTITY prompted the pace in the five path but yielded turning into the stretch. OH DARLIN raced
wellback in the three path and never threatened. OPENING BUZZ tracked in the two path, was driven along the inside around the turn, but weakened in the
stretch.

Footnotes
JAM SESSION set the pace in the two path and held firm under a drive. IF NOT FOR LUCK stalked the pace inside, steadied nearing the turn, chased
inside around the bend, tipped two wide near the sixteenth pole and was gaining between foes late. SEAVER raced off the early pace two wide, swung five
wide nearing the quarter pole and rallied outside. BEGANINGREENPOINT prompted the pace three wide and was one-paced between foes in the lane.
ITALIAN SYMPHONY raced in range three wide and had a mild rally. CHRISTENSEN was bumped at the start, raced well back four wide, swung widest in
upper stretch and rallied belatedly. JERRY'S TURN had his head turned at the start, chased the pace four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and
lacked the needed rally. WOW WISH was bumped at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. TUDDENHAM MILL (IRE) had some speed two wide
and steadily faded. FAR FROM HOME had early speed at the rail, was shuffled back entering the turn and continued to fade inside.
