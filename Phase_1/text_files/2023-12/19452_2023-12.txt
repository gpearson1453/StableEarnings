Footnotes
MO SMOKING stalked along the inside, bid outside of the clear leader around the far turn and drew clear in midstretch. MACEE set a clear pace in the three
to two path, but was bested by an outer rival entering the lane, yielded through the final furlong but safely lasted for place. STAR'S DREAM pursued from
midpack in the four path, inherited show turning for home and ran on to close the gap on place. MYLIES STAR saved ground off of the pace but to no avail.
I DONT KNOW EITHER lacked speed and made little impact. KAITLYN'S COURT was outrun. KATIE'S C tracked in the three path and weakened around
the far turn.

Footnotes
CALLING stalked in the two to three path, bid in upper stretch, led at the furlong grounds, drove clear and held sway. SWEET LITTLE ROSE tracked in the
two path, fanned out to the five path entering upper stretch, rallied to gain place at the sixteenth pole but needed more to reel in the leader. CCED FOR
STEPH prompted two wide, led at the three furlong pole, drew clear turning for home, but was bested by an outer bidder in midstretch and gave way.
SCARLET STORM trailed early on, improved between horses at the three furlong pole and ran on. WAR TOURIST lacked speed two wide and made little
impact. CUSTOMIZED TWIN set the pace inside of a prompting rival, got headed at the three furlong pole and weakened. SERENADINGTHEMOON failed
to factor three wide. CECE WAVE laid off of the pace along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
QUINN MURPHY settled off of the pace in the two to three path, tracked in the four to five path around the far turn, rallied to reel in the clear leader at the
sixteenth pole and drove clear. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME vied two wide and between horses, then inside of a rival around the far turn, drew clear at the
quarter pole, but was collared by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole and was bested. FAT AND FURIOUS vied inside of a pair of foes leaving the first turn,
but failed to sustain vying position with eleven sixteenths to run, chased the leading pair from between horses into the far turn, yielded position once again
nearing the lane, yet sustained stride while shifting ground outwardly coming to midstretch, then stayed on between horses while hanging on his left lead to
claim show. SKYKAT broke a step slow, prompted three wide and between horses before backing off to stalk nearing the backstretch, got floated to the five
path at the five furlongs pole, ranged up outside of rivals to take aim on the leaders nearing the lane, but was outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch and
flattened out. FADED MEMORIES pursued from midpack along the inside, checked out of tight rail quarters entering the backstretch, took closer order along
the fence with nine sixteenths to go, tracked from the pocket into the far turn, but only managed to chase in upper stretch before fading. BROADWAY
PEARL trailed in the five to four path, swung to the seven path in upper stretch and moved up. CAVE CREEK vied outside of a pair of foes and from the four
path entering the backstretch, sparred with only a single inner rival while tucking to the three path entering the far turn, but weakened between horses
entering the lane. QUINN ELLA tracked in the two path, moved out to the four path and between horses with five furlongs to go, pursued among foes around
the far turn, then gave way nearing the stretch and was eased up in the final furlong.

Footnotes
PI YO PRINCESS pursued from the three to four path while among foes, smoothly split foes at the quarter pole, bid and cleared approaching midstretch,
met an outer challenge entering the final sixteenth and held firm. J Z'S FIRST trailed two wide advanced between horses into the far turn, awaited racing
room turning for home in the two path, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, but encountered traffic once again in upper stretch, tipped inwardly in
midstretch to knife through rivals, took aim outside of the clear leader leaving the furlong grounds, ranged up to bid at the sixteenth pole but was kept at bay.
CAVIAR RESOLUTION settled off of the pace in the two path then along the inside, swung to the eight path entering the lane, rallied to vie for minor
placings in midstretch but leveled off in the final furlong. NO NANNETTE NO tracked along the inside, lost position while awaiting racing room behind rivals
around turning for home, split foes in upper stretch and ran on willingly. MORNING LINE NEWS pursued from midpack in the two path, then in the three
path and between horses around the far turn, but steadied in crowded quarters entering the lane, yet kept on between horses. STACK SHACK laid off of the
pace in the four path, moved forward to press the leaders from the five path around the far turn, floated to the six path entering the lane, sustained a chase
among foes through midstretch but weakened in the final sixteenth. PELLETIER broke slowly but avoided crowded quarters by doing so, lacked speed
along the inside, gained quickly in the six path around the far turn, but leveled off entering the lane in the seven path and between horses, then checked
when backing out of tight quarters at the three sixteenths pole and faded. SWEET PERFECTION pursued from midpack in the five path, offered an early bid
outside of the leading pair with five furlongs to go, vied in the four path into and around the far turn, but weakened between horses in the five path at the
quarter pole. SERIOUSLY SAM stalked in the three path, vied two wide and between horses into the far turn but weakened in upper stretch. LADY LANA
set the pace inside of vying rivals approaching the far turn, but weakened inside of a trio of foes at the five sixteenths pole. LAKE RUNNER pursued in the
four path and between horses, but faded at the half mile pole and was done early.

Footnotes
DREWSILLA prompted along the inside, led from an outer vying rival while a path off of the inside around the far turn, inched slightly free in upper stretch
and held sway. STARSNMOTION set the pace in the the three path as an inner rival applied pressure, vied with that one around the far turn, chased after
failing to maintain even terms in upper stretch and was kept at bay thereafter. CZAR'S BALLERINA laid off of the pace in the three to four path, advanced in
the five path turning for home, but flattened out and saved show from an inner bidder. SMART IZZY trailed along the inside,, improved up to the rail and
missed show. CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked in the four to two path around the first turn then gave way. LEAD ME
bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked in the five to four path, chased in the three path around the far turn and weakened between horses entering
the lane.

Footnotes
PROTONIC POWER settled off of the pace along the inside, took closer order to track the main group from the two path around the far turn, shifted out to
the five path in upper stretch, rallied to gain an advantage at the furlong grounds and drove clear. EL ORIENTE (CHI) laid off of the pace three wide, urged
along between horses around the far turn, swung to the seven path entering the lane and rallied to gain place in the final sixteenth. NELSON AVENUE
leaned out and brushed a rival at the start, stalked in the four path before shifting outside of foes and to the six path exiting the first turn, ranged up four wide
around the far turn to bid at the five sixteenths pole, led entering the lane, but delayed changing leads until the three sixteenths pole, drifted out subtly while
getting headed by an outer bidder leaving that station and yielded. ROMAN CENTURIAN was brushed by an inner rival and taken in hand at the start,
trailed along the inside, saved ground around the far turn, awaited racing room turning for home and into the turn, shfited two wide in upper stretch and ran
on. MONAASIB tracked along the inside, offered an early bid between the leading pair to vie at the half mile pole, battled around the far turn and through
upper stretch, but was bested by an outer rival nearing the furlong grounds and yielded between horses in the final sixteenth. UNIFIED DREAMS vied
outside of a rival and in the five path around the first turn, then three wide at the half mile pole, between horses into the far turn, yielded entering the lane
before shifting to the six path at the quarter pole and faded. MR. BIG NEWS lacked speed two to four path, fanned to the eight path entering the lane and
failed to factor. TIWANAKU set the pace inside of a rival and in the three path around the first turn, vied with an outer pair while tucking to the inside nearing
the far turn, and weakened nearing the lane.

Footnotes
LURE'EM IN tracked just behind the main and trio and from the two path, easily took aim outside of the leader when rivals drifted entering the lane, bid and
forged an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, then drove clear. CATSKILL HUMOR leaned out and bumped a rival at the start, dueled for the lead along
the inside, inherited an advantage when her counterpart drifted wide entering the lane, but was headed by an outer bidder at the three sixteenths pole and
held place thereafter. EMPIRE OF MY OWN dueled for the lead with an inner rival, took the turn in the three path, but failed to keep even terms while
drifting to the five path entering the lane, yet sustained a chase to maintain show thereafter. MISS RIVER RAT took contact from an inner rival at the start,
raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, steadied hard out of crowded quarters into the turn, trailed turning for home, fanned out to the seven
path in midstretch and offered a late kick. LITTLE MOMBO stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, but was floated to the six path entering the
lane and gave way on her left lead. JUST PUSH SEND bobbled at the start and failed to menace from the four to five path. EMPIRES PRINCESS lacked
speed three wide and between horses but steadied hard into the turn and made little impact thereafter.

Footnotes
FREEBURN stalked along the inside, took aim in the three path turning for home, bid at the quarter pole, cleared while hanging on his left lead, changed
over entering the final sixteenth and held safely under no urging. PLATINUM MINIT lacked speed three wide, swung to the six path in upper stretch and
offered a good belated kick but was too late to reel in the leader. A MISS DEAMEANOR stalked in the three to four path and kept on to edge show late.
ARMY DAY broke outwardly, set the pace in the two path, but was bested by an outer bidder in upper stretch and weakened. MOION was herded outwardly
and forced to bump an outer rival at the start, then failed to menace from the two path. FRANCESNFRIENDS saved ground well back but to no avail.
DELIGHTFUL HALO laid off of the pace in the five path and faded. GIANT TUDE was bumped by an inner rival at the start and slow to recover, then
showed little. NO FEAR broke outwardly while rank at the start, chased from midpack in the four path, then weakened before being eased in the final
sixteenth.
