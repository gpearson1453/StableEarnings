Footnotes
COURAGEOUS COPPER set the pace in the two path, dug inside of SWAGGISH when that foe reached near even terms and bumped him near the
sixteenth pole and held safe. SWAGGISH was crowded at the start, advanced outside down the backstretch, stalked the winner in the three path around the
turn, bid leaving the eighth pole, came in and bumped the winner near the sixteenth pole and was turned back. THE GREAT CESAR was off a bit slowly,
raced off the pace at the rail and was along for the show. PEJA DU chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. FORTY FLASH raced in range
three wide and was one-paced through the lane. WARLORD CRUZAN bumped with SMOKIN CLOUD soon after the start, chased the pace in the two path
and faded through the stretch. SMOKIN CLOUD was bumped early, raced three wide and never threatened. GONE NUTS was outrun while racing four
wide. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
EL TERRENO set the pace in the three path, was put to a nudge midway around the turn, kicked away in the four path under minor rousing going into the
stretch, and was wrapped up in the final sixteenth. BUBBLY CHAMPAGNE chased in the three path, angled out to the six path under a drive turning into the
lane, and kept on for place. DOT bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the five path, ranged up midway around the turn, and finished evenly for
show. BEDROCK BIRDIE stalked in the two path, was coaxed along the inside midway around the turn, but flattened from the three path in the stretch.
HAPPY WORLD bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the four path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but did not threaten.
DEVIL AT MIDNIGHT prompted the pace in the four path, was ridden between foes early around the turn, but yielded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
KIKI stalked the pace in the three path, seized command leaving the eighth pole and drew off while ridden out. MISS ATHLETIC veered in at the start,
advanced inside down the backstretch, set the pace just off the rail, drifted out in the stretch, was swallowed up leaving the eighth pole but held well clear of
the rest. HOLY KINGDOM had early speed between foes, could not keep pace while racing in the four path around the turn and bested the rest.
MAELSTROM SPIRIT was bumped at the start and outrun while racing in the three path. JESS'S MOMENT was reluctant to load, broke inwardly and
bumped at the start, led early, chased inside around the turn and retreated through the lane.

JIGSAW set the pace in the five path, was confidently handled in the four path around the turn, cued in the three path entering the stretch, opened up into
the final furlong, drifted out in the final sixteenth, but held sway. DOLLAR LIBERTY pressed the outer winner in the three path, was roused into the turn, lost
touch with the winner while drifting out to the seven path in upper stretch, and kept on for place. ECHO LANE raced off the pace in the six path, was driven
in the five path around the turn, and was along from out in the six path in the stretch for show. DYNAMIC EMPIRE bumped with an inner foe at the start,
tracked in the four path, was ridden in the three path around the turn, but flattened from the four path in the stretch. RUNNINGTHENUMBERS bumped with
an outer foe at the start, chased inside but retreated turning into the stretch. MOBY WARRIOR trailed throughout around the six path.

MOST WANTED MAN was unhurried in the two path early, tipped out under coaxing rounding the far turn, fanned out to the eight path to take aim at the top
of the lane, and drew past an inner duo around the final sixteenth. HUSBAND MATERIAL bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the three path,
bumped with the same inner foe while under a ride in the four path midway around the far turn, shifted out to the seven path entering the stretch, ran on to
head the fading inner pacesetter passing the eighth pole, but was out-finished by an outer foe to place. MISTER MOORE set the pace inside, was coaxed
into the turn, dug in while floating out to the four path at the top of the lane, but faded late in the final furlong to show. FLATTER ME rated inside, was ridden
from the rail around the turn, tipped out to the five path entering the stretch, but failed to bid. THIS RUN'S FOR YOU bumped with an outer foe at the start,
stalked from the two path, was cued into the far turn, bumped with an outer foe midway around the far turn, and yielded.

Footnotes
BODACIOUS BREN vied for the lead with an inner foe in the three path, was confidently handled around the turn, floated out to the five path at the top of
the lane, inched clear while tipping inwards passing the sixteenth, and safely held off an outer foe. CHASING AFTER YOU trailed in the two path, was
coaxed along from the rail around the turn, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. PEACH COBBLER stalked inside, was driven
in the four path midway around the turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the stretch, and kept on for show. AVATAL HERO chased in the three path,
was coaxed from the five path around the turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the lane, but made no impact. FORTUNA BELLE dueled for the
lead in the two path, was ridden into the turn, tipped out to the three path at the top of the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. FORCES SWEETHEART
hopped at the start, raced off the pace in the four path and never threatened along the inside down the lane. NO ACTION tracked between foes in the two
path, but was empty in the five path at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
JULIET'S ROSE set the pace in the two path, drew off around the turn and widened while ridden out through the stretch. EUPHIMA (ARG) raced off the
pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and ran on to gain the place. OLGA chased the winner in the three path, was no match for that foe
and held well enough for the show. WRIGHT UP FRONT chased the pace two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. DRUM ROLL was outrun inside.
DEM A WONDER chased the pace two wide and was through after a half. THREE POLKS had only brief speed inside.

Footnotes
MAGIC MOONSTAR set the pace in the two path, was roused while floating out to the four path at the top of the stretch, and dug in to hold sway. DRINKS
ON ME prompted the pace in the three path, bid from the five path turning into the lane, and stayed on, but was repelled by the winning pacesetter to place.
SASSY MELISSA raced off the pace in the four path, was coaxed midway around the turn, tipped out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and kept on
for show. SERENADE A KITTEN chased in the four path but flattened down the lane. BARBARA hopped at the start, stalked inside, was ridden from the rail
around the turn, but faded on her left lead in the stretch. L. E. GRAY rated in the two path, but was stymied along the inside passing the quarter, and did not
threaten. WINNING AT EASE raced in midpack between foes in the two path but weakened in the stretch. STARRY HOPE trailed in the three path, had to
check going into the turn, and never menaced.
