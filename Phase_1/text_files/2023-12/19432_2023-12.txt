Footnotes
MAKE NO MISTAKE settled in midfield outside foes three wide on the first bend, improved outside runners down the back straight, cruised to the lead at the
three furlong pole, opened up at the top of the lane and held safe by a diminishing margin at the wire. TEMPEREYA was nestled on the rail in the early
stages behind the frontrunner, started to reach for more ground shifting outside three wide going around horses at the quarter pole and determinedly chased
the winner home closing in smartly at the finish line. ITS A BIRDIE was coaxed early tp get the lead on the rail heading into the first turn, slowed the pace
down dictating terms up front down the backstretch, was collared by the winner at the three furlong marker outside, offered no resistance and mildly finished
up on the fence down the lane to hold for third money. AMI'S LINK was off a step slow to trail in the early going, travelled outside four deep stalking at the
half mile marker, rallied three wide around rivals at the three eighths pole making a brief run and levelled out through the stretch to settle on the fringes in
the end. ERASMO'S GIRL stalked between foes having one rival beaten on the first turn, could see the bunched up field at the half, made little headway on
the final turn and passed a weary runner in the stretch. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN tracked the pacesetter outside on the first turn, shadowed the leader down
the backstretch could not maintain position between runners who were making a move at the seven sixteenths pole and emptied out at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
SUGARTAP broke through the gate prior to the start, tracked behind the front pair down the backside, angled out closing in three wide at the quarter pole,
pounced to the lead at the furlong marker on just held on running on the wrong lead to the finish line. BUSTA GROOVE was off a step slow to begin, trailing
on the fence in the early stages, saved ground at the back around the bend, was looking for room the extend his stride in upper stretch, found a seam for
clear run in the four path at the eighth pole and closed in quickly, just missing at the wire while not switching leads through the stretch. AUTUMN'S SO
FLASHY was void of speed settling near the back between foes down the backstretch, began to pick up rivals three wide at the quarter pole and finished up
gamely between foes in mid-stretch to be a non threatening third crossing the line. CUT'EM LOOSE was slow at the start, stalked on the outside near the
rear down the backside, made mild progress three wide through the turn, swung out widest in the six path straightening for the drive and finished with intent
for a minor share. COMMANDER AT SEA tracked three wide with runners on each side down the backstretch, was in tight briefly inside the three furlong
marker to be shuffled back some on the turn, rallied in the two path in range of the leaders at the top of the stretch, lost his path and momentum at the
sixteenth pole and could not recover in time to pose a threat at the finish. LLOYD prompted to pace outside down the backstretch, was nudged for more at
the three furlong marker, assumed the lead at the quarter pole, could not find more late and yielded on the fence at the sixteenth pole. IT'S ME MARIO
tracked four deep outside rivals in the early going, was scrubbed on keeping pace three wide around the turn, shifted outside in the five path turning for
home but had little to show in the drive to the wire. HARD RELOAD took this field on the rail down the back straight, was headed outside with five sixteenths
to go, offered little response and backed away through the field on the rail in upper stretch.

Footnotes
IT WORKED travelled in mid-pack on the rail, edged closer saving ground while in hand around the turn, surged on the fence to take control at the eighth
pole and drew away convincingly in deep stretch. MALIBU SECRET tracked the pace inside down the backstretch, waited for his cue to move through the
turn, pounced at the quarter pole inside to briefly take command, could not hold off the winner at the furlong marker but comfortably bested the rest crossing
the finish line. CHANCEL was away quickly to lead while getting out a touch down the backstretch, set the pace while unchallenged through the turn, drifted
out giving up the lead at the quarter pole and ran on to the finish line to be a clear but distant third at the wire. UPSTART GENTLEMAN broke inwards at the
start, had one rival beaten down the backstretch, crept closer to the leaders on the rail at the quarter pole and finished up with good interest to settle on the
fringes in the end. BOCELLI was unhurried to trail in the early going, could not get involved running around the bend and made little impact in the stretch
drive passing only the tiring runners. TARADAR was brushed outside on the break, travelled in midfield on the outside down the backstretch, could not
quicken with others around the oval and made little impression down the stretch. DIAMONDBACK watched the front two outside down the backside, was
roused midpoint on the turn but could not go on with the top duo and flattened out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ASK IN MY NAME had a slow start to begin, then was hustled down the backstretch on the rail to getter a better inside position by the half, shifted outside
making a move at the three furlong pole, angled four wide in the hunt up top turning for home and battled stubbornly to the finish winning the photo at the
wire. STEPHEN B GOOD stalked near the back on the outside of horses, rallied four wide at the three furlong pole, loomed in the five path straightening out
for the drive and dueled to the wire just missed the nod at the finish line. TODAY tracked four deep on the outside down the backstretch, began to inch
closer three wide on the turn, had a brief lead in the three path turning for home, could not go on with the top two rivals at the furlong marker but was a clear
third when all was said and done. MAGIC TOMAHAWK co-trailed on the outside in the early going, commenced a run going by rivals four wide at the
quarter pole, was closing well in the stretch and surged at the wire to just get up for the minors in a photo. MIAH SAID was in the mix up front between
horses down the backside, chased the leaders with horses on each side around the oval, posed a threat in the two path at the top of the lane but could find
no more and faded at the furlong marker. WHADDYA MEAN had a slow start to begin, recovered quickly to have a slim lead down the backside, set the
pace while hounded outside throughout the turn, was headed outside at the quarter pole and retreated on the fence by mid-stretch. HYGGE co-trailed on
the inside down the back straight, made little progress on the fence around the turn and could not be a presence in the drive to the finish line. JUST FOR
MADDIE stalked near the back on the inside under a snug hold, was checked when in tight between runners at the three furlong marker losing momentum
and could not recover down the stretch to be a factor. DEMBA forced the pace inside down the backstretch, came under a ride on the fence at the three
eighths pole but could not accelerate with the leaders around the turn and faltered in mid -stretch.

Footnotes
CAMAROSA stalked at the back having one foe beaten at the half, advanced smartly on the fence reaching for ground at the three furlong pole, angled
outside three wide at the quarter pole and wore down the leader through the stretch to edge away near the wire. WHITING FIELD prompted the pace
outside on the first turn, had a slim lead down the backstretch, continued up front while shadowed outside on the far turn, fought on between horses dueling
for the lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly to the winner in the final seventy yards. SUGAR IT'S ELI tracked outside on the first turn, pressed the
pace on the outside down the back straight, battled between horses at the top of the stretch for the lead, faded against the top pair at the furlong maker but
was a clear third at the finish. SECORD stalked near the rear down the backside, began to extend his stride on the fence at the quarter pole and willingly ran
to the wire winning the battle for a small piece of the prize. I'VE DECIDED had a slim lead on the rail into the first turn, was reined back to track the top pair
down the backside, was asked for more run three wide at the quarter pole and mildly finished up through the stretch dueling for a minor placing. OH
PEANUTS settled all alone in the third flight down the backside, was urged for move between horse at the three furlong marker, offered little response and
tired at the top of the lane. TECH WIZARD travelled on the outside in midfield down the backstretch, was hard ridden three wide outside foes around the far
turn making little progress, swung outside widest in the five path in upper stretch but had little finish to offer to the wire. CLARENCE B trailed on the outside
in the first turn, could not get interested seeing the field down the backside, touch touch to the pack around the far turn and was eased down the stretch
crossing the finish line.

Footnotes
CORNWALL found himself four wide into the first turn before settling in midpack, advanced three to four wide while on his wrong lead around the far turn,
bid for the front inside the furlong pole and widened to the wire. GOLD BONANZA stalked a runaway leader under restraint, bid inside the winner at the
quarter pole and had the lead in upper stretch but couldn't hold off that rival, a clear second best. SCAT FACTOR off the pace early and three wide, followed
the top pair four wide into the stretch, lugged in from outside to the rail by the eighth pole and continued to be a handful along the fence to the wire, clearly
third best. BLONDINA'S BOY began sluggishly and trailed before commencing a long, gradual rally while outside for a minor placing in the final stages.
SPEED LOADER nestled in nicely behind the runaway leader, stayed in contention until the turn for home but was outrun down the lane. SCREEN
LEGEND sped to the front soon after the start, fighting his rider and setting an unrealistic pace for the level, was headed at the quarter pole and retreated in
the stretch. COPROLITE sat along the rail in midpack, advanced into a contending position by the quarter pole but had nothing left for the stretch drive.
HIGHLAND ROCKY broke well but dropped back to the rear of the field by mid backstretch, never reaching contention.

Footnotes
STOP THE HUMBUG bobbled slightly on the break, trailed the field down the backside, improved smartly on the fence at the three furlong marker, found a
seam splitting runners in the two path at the quarter pole and fought on bravely inside to the finish outkicking the outside runner in deep stretch.
COLEYVILLE had one rival beaten down the backside which was the eventual winner, swooped around foes making a bold move four wide with five
sixteenths left to run, loomed outside widest in the seven path at the top of the stretch, determinedly ran to the finish line and just missed at the wire showing
another valiant effort. TIMESKIP galloped along tracking the top two between runners down the back straight, moved in closer two wide with rivals on each
side midway on the far turn, posed a threat in the four path straightening out for home but did not have enough to go on with the top two finishers in the last
few jumps before the wire. HULLABALOO took command from the start, was unopposed up front down the backside, was clinging onto the lead surrounded
by horses at the furlong pole and needed more in deep stretch to be a factor at the finish line. MAMBOINTHEFOREST stalked outside near the back in the
beginning, closed the gap on the leaders three wide at the three eighths pole, was in range just behind the leader turning for home but evened out in the last
furlong. OCTOBER FROST travelled in the middle of the pack all alone in the early going, improved down the backstretch four deep outside runners at the
half, could not gain four wide around the final turn, shifted outside to the six path in upper stretch and was no menace through the lane. HALF LIT tracked on
the rail in the first turn through the backstretch, was urged on the fence at the quarter pole, could not keep pace with others starting to move in upper stretch
and faded on the rail at the furlong marker. NATIVE PRINCE tracked the frontrunner on the outside in the early stages of the race, chased the pacesetter at
the three eighths pole and was overwhelmed by runners on each side at the quarter pole and emptied out in the stretch.

Footnotes
HIGHLAND SOCIETY was content to track the loose frontrunner down the backside, began to close in midway point on the turn, had his sights set on the
leader at the top of the stretch, went right on by to take command at the sixteenth pole and was inching away for the tally under a savvy chasing ride. ECHO
WITH LAUGHTER was asked early clearing from the outside for the lead getting to the rail by the five eighths marker, opened up on rivals around the bend,
maintained a narrow lead at the furlong pole but could not hold off the winner closing in deep stretch. SWATH had a slow start to begin, had only two rivals
beaten down the backstretch, split foes going by horses at the three furlong marker, continued a good turn of foot at the quarter pole and was full of run late
gaining with every stride but could not reel in the top two by the time the finish line came up. READY HERO settled in the third flight tracking from the
outside in the early going, inched closer at the quarter pole and willingly finished up battling between horses in deep stretch to garner a minor placing in the
end. LUCYS CHILD watched the top two leaders down the backstretch, was scrubbed on for more on the rail at the quarter pole and stubbornly fought on
the fence with a furlong to go but could not win the battle for show. COPINSAY stalked near the back inside down the back straight, saved ground around
the turn but could not make any headway and could not pose a threat evenly running down the stretch. MO TOURIST was roused on the fence down the
backstretch but was going in the wrong direction, made little gain inside through the turn and passed tired foes at the furlong pole. TRANQUILITY BASE
travelled in midfield between horses down the backside, kept pace while asked through the turn and stalled four wide by mid-stretch. I LIVE BY FAITH was
slow on the start, stalked near the rear outside horses, made a brief run at the five sixteenths pole and faltered in the five path in upper stretch. FIRST
SPRING was allowed to settle trailing down the backside, caught up to the field outside runners at the three furlong pole and could not offer a finish in the
stretch drive.
