AUGIE'S GIRL set the early pace while clear and in the two path, drew out off the turn, then drifted out slightly through the lane and remained clear to prove
best under crop urging. NO COMMON CENT chased the winner and made a four wide bid on the turn, finished willingly to be clearly second best. SHORT
OF DINERO was well placed on the inside and weakened, bested rest. ROCK IT RUBY stalked the pace three wide and tired. UPTOWN CHARLY GIRL
raced five to six wide and was not a threat. PELOSI lost iron at the start and was not a factor. DUE TO PROBLEM WITH LIGHTS RACE WAS DELAYED
ABOUT TEN MINUTES. DUE TO PHOTO FINISH MALFUNCTION THE FINAL MARGINS WERE MADE BY THE WRITER OF THIS CHART.

HARVEY SPECTER was away alertly and crossed over to the inside to set the early pace while clear, then was in the two path on the turn, drew off in the
lane to prove much the best under hand urging. ABBY'S SPIRIT tracked the pace on the outside and came four wide into the drive but proved to be no
match for the winner, second best. WARRIOR'S WAY OUT tracked the pace three to two wide but lacked the needed bid, bested rest. TWIXTER tracked
the early pace in between rivals, fell back on the turn, four wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. VINDICATO failed to respond.

Footnotes
KAZ CREED set the pace while racing slightly removed from the rail and gradually increased his advantage. EAST AURORA was reserved off the early
pace while saving ground, slipped through entering the stretch and finished in a mild rally. EDDIE FELSON was allowed to settle in stride, moved up
three-wide nearing the three-eighths pole, offered a bid nearing the quarter pole but was unable to sustain the rally in a steady effort. FINAL
OPPORTUNITY was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide and weakened after a half mile. BRIGHT PATH saved ground while being unhurried but
lacked a rally. MAX BARLEY dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch but was not a threat. BELLS RUN lacked early speed while saving
ground and failed to menace.

MY REDEMPTION was allowed to settle early, moved up three-wide nearing the eighth pole and edged clear late. HONORABLE AVENUE set the pace
racing slightly off the railed, responded when headed nearing the eighth pole and held on gamely to the wire. HANALEI'S HOUDINI prompted the issue
while racing two-wide, angled in nearing the stretch, slipped through to offer a bid nearing the eighth pole but lacked the needed late response. COOL
COMEDIAN was prominent early while racing between horses to near the stretch and weakened. SUPER DUDE dropped back early, came five-wide into
the stretch and was not a factor. NICK PAPAGIORGIO showed speed from along the inside for three furlongs and gave way.

came four-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. MAKE ME LUCKY was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. AMUSING

BIG SIS NIC set the pace while racing slightly off the rail, opened clear entering the stretch and gradually increased her advantage. BRIEF prompted the
pace from along the inside, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole to be four-wide, could not reach the winner but finished well for the place. MAKE A
SPLASH was off a step slow then moved up to be forwardly placed while saving ground and finished in a mild rally. RIGHTOFFTHEBENCH was close up
early, came two-wide into the stretch and finished well in a steady effort. NANASQUAN was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to
seriously threaten. LET'S GO MO dropped back while saving ground and failed to menace. OMIKAMI gave way after showing brief speed while racing
three-wide.
