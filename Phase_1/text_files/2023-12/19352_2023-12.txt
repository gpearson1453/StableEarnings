Footnotes
CLEOPATRA'S NILE pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, drifted out and lost ground in upper stretch, straightened
out in midstretch, closed determinedly and was up in the final strides. PARALLEL set the pace in the two path, dueled inside of the winner around the far
turn, regained a clear lead when that foe drifted out in upper stretch and led until the final strides. VINO FOR THE QUEEN saved ground off the pace, could
not keep pace with the top two nearing the quarter pole but stayed on to gain the show. RUN FOR HOME raced in range two wide and lacked a closing bid.
MISS CASSIDY failed to menace while racing two wide. FONTINA hit the starting gate, rated up close in the four path and had no response while still four
deep around the far turn.

Footnotes
APOCALYPSO stalked in the four path, bumped with an inner foe going into the turn, bid three wide around the turn, drew past an inner foe while in the four
path just before the eighth pole, and went clear under a drive. DREAM KNIGHT prompted the pace between foes in the three path, bumped with an outer
foe going into the turn, was roused to bid from the rail and took a short lead passing the quarter, ran on from the two path into the stretch, but was caught by
an outer foe nearing the eighth pole to place. FORT ATTITUDE had an awkward start but moved up inside of foes to set the pace from the two path into the
turn, was cued while being passed on both sides nearing the quarter, floated out to the five path turning into the lane, and was one paced for show.
NATURE BOY tracked in the three path, was ridden in the two path around the turn, but flattened in the stretch. FILIGREE rated in the six path, shifted into
the three path under coaxing going into the turn, angled back out to the seven path at the top of the lane, but failed to bid. FEDERAL EXCHANGE trailed
from the three path into the turn and never menaced. ASTRAL WEEKS chased in the four path but was empty turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
VILLEGAS SWING set the pace in the two path, was confidently handled while facing an outer challenger around the turn, was roused from the three path
into the stretch, dug in, switched leads passing the eighth pole, drifted out slightly in the final sixteenth, but held sway. PEACH NECTAR raced up close
outside the leader in the four path, bid in hand from the three path around the turn, was cued in the four path at the top of the stretch, and ran on, but was
repelled to place. GOTTA LIKE HIM tracked in the two path, was roused between foes into the turn, shifted out to the six path turning into the lane, and kept
on for show. TEJOTA rated in the five path, fanned out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but made no impact. ACAMAR trailed in the three path
early and never factored. JOYFUL SURPRISE stalked inside, was coaxed from the rail around the turn, but faded in the stretch. MORETHANICANHANDLE
chased in the four path but backed up between foes around the turn.

NO FAKE raced off the pace three wide, angled five wide near the quarter pole, closed outside, took over near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. PARTY
SHAKER stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the sixteenth pole, could not match strides with the winner from there but dug in to hold the
place. POPPA CHIPPY set the pace in the two path, led to the sixteenth pole and held well enough between foes late to save the show. I LOVE
VENEZUELA stalked the pace from the rail and was outkicked inside of foes late. INABLINK hesitated at the start, raced off the pace two wide, continued on
the left lead in the lane, swung out nearing the sixteenth pole and ran on outside. PLATINUM ROCKER lunged at the start, raced off the pace three wide,
shifted further out in upper stretch and had a belated rally. UMBRAL bobbled at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. HOUSE OF MELODY was
bumped at the start, raced five wide off the pace and was never involved. DIVA BALLERINA chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. IN
AMERICAN played no factor while racing two wide. MAELSTROM SPIRIT hesitated at the start and was outrun in the two path. MY SWEETHEART DANI
bumped at the start, chased the pace four wide and faltered in the drive.

closing outer pair to show. PURE SPEIGHT tracked in the four path, bid midway around the turn, fought on in upper stretch, but faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
PANTHER ISLAND set a pressured pace in the two path, drew clear in upper stretch and held safe. FULL DISCLOSURE stalked the pace inside, angled
out and belatedly switched leads near the sixteenth pole, closed late and ran out of ground. EXTENDO pressed the winner in the three path and was
one-paced through the lane to hold the show. UNCLE B chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. THE DISTRACTOR broke outwardly,
raced off the pace four and five wide and never threatened. NO NAME DUDE trailed while appearing to try to get out throughout.

Footnotes
NO NAY HUDSON (IRE) raced prominently alongside of the pacesetter in the two path, tipped out to the three path turning into the lane, and drew past the
inner pacesetter around the sixteenth. YES I AM FREE bumped between foes at the start, set the pace in the three path, was cued from the two path going
into the stretch, and ran on, but was caught by an outer foe in the final sixteenth to place. ZARAK (CHI) chased between foes in the three path and kept on
from the four path in the stretch for show. AXTHELM raced off the pace in the three path, fanned out to the nine turning into the lane, and stayed on.
CRISPY CAT (GB) laid up close in the four path, floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, but was one paced. AVANT GLORY was unhurried along
the rail, waited for room turning into the lane, and finished evenly. MAMBA ON THREE tracked between foes in the two path, swung out to the seven path
turning into the stretch, but flattened. ROCKIN ROLLER bumped at the start with an outer foe, rated in the five path, floated out to the eight turning into the
stretch, but did not factor. MOUNSIEUR COCO raced wellback in the four path and did not threaten. BAD BEAT BRIAN bumped on both sides at the start,
raced in midpack from the four path, but faded in the six path down the stretch. SOUZAK (FR) stalked along the rail but weakened down the lane. XY
SPEED was reluctant to load, bumped with an inner foe at the start, and always trailed.

Footnotes
NOTHING BUT PUMPS hit the starting gate, trailed inside early, advanced four wide around the far turn, moved to the front nearing the sixteenth pole and
drew clear under left-handed urging. DREAM TRAP raced in range while racing three and four wide, bid between foes in upper stretch and was second best
late. R AWESOME SAUCE set the pace in the two path and gave way nearing the sixteenth pole. GRATIA failed to menace while racing two wide. ALHAAN
had early speed four wide, dropped back down the backstretch, raced three wide around the far turn and had no further bids. LA DAME DE FER was up
close inside and came up empty in the lane. KRABI pressed the pace in the five path around the first turn and in the three path around the far turn then
retreated through the stretch.
