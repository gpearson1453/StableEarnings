MISS FUSSY PANTS was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide through the turn, rallied to make the lead at the top of the stretch then widened
at will the balance of the trip to win as much the best while in handy. HOT CAROL drifted out leaving the chute, set a pressured pace to the top of the
stretch then was no match for the winner. COWGIRL KIMMIE drifted out bumping CHORIST at the start, was allowed to settle, swung wide entering the
stretch then finished determinedly in the seven path. SWEET BELEN also drifted out leaving the chute, prompted the pace two wide into the turn then
weakened in the stretch. SABELLE was bumped at the start, in tight entering the main track, dropped inside rivals, had speed into the turn then tired.
CHORIST was bumped at the start, taken outside soon thereafter and trailed. THE RIDER OF SABELLE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF
FINISH.

Footnotes
ROSY APPLE prompted the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead near the quarter pole, set the balance of the pace and finished full of run under mild
urging to win going away. LA REINA DEL NORTE set a pressured pace inside the winner to the quarter pole then kept on along the rail and finished second
best. FLYING BUSINESS drifted in bumping WOLF EYES at the start, veered inward nearing the turn, saved ground through the bend, shifted out to the
three path entering the stretch and finished evenly. WOLF EYES was bumped and pinched back at the start then failed to reach contention. BIRDIE BLUE
was no factor. LUCKY ROAD failed to menace. DE PURA SANGRE stalked the early pace three wide and weakened on the turn.

Footnotes
EARLY BLOOMER allowed to settle, closed with a burst of speed six wide through the stretch under strong handling and got up in the final strides. ANGEL
WINGS vied for the lead along the inside into the turn, split horses two wide entering the stretch, made the lead, shook clear late then couldn't handle the
late charge of the winner. LADY FORTUNE never far back, began to rally along the inside into the stretch, lacked racing room, shifted out four wide nearing
the furlong marker, dropped back in two wide nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good courage. MERE BAG OF SHELLS pressed the pace two
wide into the turn, gained a narrow advantage before a half, battled until deep stretch then came up empty. FABULOUS CLOWN failed to menace.
SORORITY SISTER stalked the pace three then four wide into the stretch and faded late. WHERETHERE'SSMOKE well placed, failed to respond.
PRICELESS PICTURE was no threat. OUT FOR FUN was no factor. MISS ELLIE sped to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside for
nearly a half, remained a sharp threat until deep stretch then weakened. LEDGENDARY KITTEN was always outrun. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE
INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
MONTAUK COVE vied for lead the lead along the inside, dug in to engage the leader at the top of the stretch, battled to the wire and proved best in a game
effort under strong handling. QUICK ENTRY made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace until deep stretch, dug in determinedly and gained
second. NICHOLAS JAMES allowed to settle, split horses two wide in deep stretch, was steadily gaining ground, clipped heels past the wire, fell and was
vanned off. ROCK ON KITTEN well placed outside, closed a gap late five wide. AMIGO'S AFFAIR stalked the pace outside down the backstretch, loomed
boldly three wide midway on the turn, matched strides four wide until the final stages and was outfinished. NEWS BOX found his best stride late.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN settled inside and went evenly. HARD N'SWEET was no factor.

NEPOTISM stalked the early pace four wide, took command three wide entering the far turn, set the balance of the pace and drew off under mild left handed
urging to win as much the best while taken in hand late. SWELTER bore out at the start, settled mid pack, rallied five wide through the stretch and got up for
second. ALEXIS N NIKO set the pace along the inside through the clubhouse turn, kept pressure into the stretch and finished with good courage. FIVE
STAR PHIL allowed to settle, offered a mild bid three then two wide into the stretch then leveled off. STRASBOURG well placed, rallied four wide through
the far turn then came up empty. BOSS BEAR was no factor. OCTOBER FROST was no threat. RIKIO pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then gave
way. KING SOCIAL was carried out at the start and always outrun. LONG RAP SHEET failed to menace. MASTER pressed the pace three wide around the
first bend, made the lead, set the pace to the seven sixteenths pole then was used up.
