Footnotes
LADY EVA was coaxed for the lead, having a slim advantage inside down the backstretch, began to pull away from the rival forcing the pace outside at the
three furlong pole, opened up at the top of the lane and cruised home to the wire in a convincing fashion. FLOWERS 'N BERRIES pressed the issue
between runners in the beginning, was throttled down to track the front twosome three wide outside of horses at the half, rallied three wide around foes at
the quarter pole and won the duel for the place share, being a distant second in the end. I'M A BOURBON GIRL prompted the frontrunner three deep early
on, continued to press the pace outside at the three furlong marker, could not match strides with the pacesetting winner when urged at the quarter pole and
stubbornly battled with runners on each side to the wire holding for third money in a photo. CRUMLIN BEAST tracked the front duo on the rail down the
backside, saved ground inching closer to the chasing rivals through the turn, battled for the place and show positions in upper stretch on the fence and just
lost the nod for third at the finish line. P. S. RISING STAR trailed outside down the back straight, could not get involved with the field around the bend and
showed a little interest passing a weary foe at the furlong marker. CRASH THE CREASE was off a step slow to begin, pulled the rider taking closer order to
track the leaders between horses at the half, was roused for more to try to go with others five sixteenths out, made little progress through the turn and gave
way by mid-stretch.

Footnotes
FOXY LADY broke sharp to lead in the beginning, was relegated to track the contesting pair down the backside outside of rivals, at the quarter pole was
ridden to go on starting to reach for more ground, swung out widest in the five path full of run in the stretch and went by challengers at the sixteenth pole to
edge away crossing the line. HARD TO CAPTURE trailed the compact field down the backside, still could see the pack saving ground through the turn,
rallied on the fence straightening out for the drive, angled off the fading leader on the fence at the eighth pole and dueled gamely to the wire but was second
best on this day. GREEN GABLES assumed command on the rail at the five eighths marker, set the pace while pressured outside around the turn, put away
the early speed foe in upper stretch, drifted inwards to the rail when urged right handed at the furlong marker clinging to the lead and did not have enough
late to fend off the closing finishers in the final sixteenth. GIVE ME THE BOOTS prompted the pace outside down the back straight, shadowed the leader
outside around the bend, bid for the lead bobbing heads up top turning for home and was on the wrong lead when tiring at the furlong marker. SOCIAL
DRINKER stalked inside early on down the backstretch, took closer order to the leaders tracking on the fence by the half mile marker, closed the gap on the
engaged front pair throughout the turn, loomed a presence in the four path at the top of the lane but faltered by the furlong marker.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY IN JAIL broke out at the start, was content to sit just back outside the frontrunner on the first turn, continued to patiently sit off the pacesetter
down the backside, bid for the lead two wide at the quarter pole and determinedly fought to the finish taking the entire stretch to wear down a stubborn
frontrunning rival. VILLI OLENTO assumed the lead at the start, set a comfortable even pace unopposed down the backside, was collared outside by the
eventual winner at the quarter pole and tenaciously maintained a slim lead down the lane but gave way grudgingly in deep stretch. NORMA NO travelled in
mid-pack on the rail in the early going, watched the front two down the backstretch, could not quicken with the top pair when the running picked up midway
on the final turn and was one paced on the fence to the wire to be a clear but distant third in the end. MELODY'S KISS veered inwards and was taken a hold
of at the start, settled on the rail trailing the field into the first turn, loped along seeing the compact field down the back straight, caught up to runners inside
at the three furlong pole when urged and battled in the stretch to settle on the fringes in the end. POWAQA was squeezed between runners on the break,
tracked on the outside in midfield down the backstretch, was asked for more at the three eighths pole, made little gain on the leaders through the far turn
and dueled outside for the minor share but was outgamed in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
INFAMOUS COVERT settled outside off the pace three to four wide, advanced on the far turn, floated about six wide into upper stretch, struck the lead by
mid-stretch, powered away under urging. STORMIN DAVE attended then pressed the pace outside two to three wide, bid coming to the quarter pole, was
floated out four to five wide turning for home with the lead, overtaken in mid-stretch and was outkicked while second best. JUST START ME UP was
strongly urged at the start, made the lead and set the pace inside, drifted out leaving the far turn, weakened. GENDRAGON eased back off the leaders,
stalking in behind off the rail in about the two to three path, was one-paced and made no bid. KITTEN'S BOY tucked in heading into the first turn racing
mid-pack two deep, fanned six wide into upper stretch, failed to rally. JMR PURE SENSATION was taken back early and shifted in, saved ground inside
held up at the rear, fanned six wide turning for home, was not a threat. SAME AGAIN DOC was forwardly-placed outside four wide early, steadily retreated.

Footnotes
WICKENHEISER stalked on the fence having one horse beaten on the first turn, galloped along closing the gap on the leaders down the backside, was
asked midpoint on the far turn, quickly swooped around runners by the quarter pole, took command at the furlong marker outside and was edging clear for
the win crossing the wire. SHE MAKES A POINT assumed the lead getting to the rail on the first turn, dictated an honest pace uncontested down the
backstretch, was headed outside by a rival at the quarter pole, battled gamely on the fence until the furlong marker but was no match for the winner nearing
the wire. BUTTERED TOAST was unhurried trailing in the first turn, still could see the compact bunch three wide outside down the backside, swung out
gaining momentum in the five path at the top of the stretch, picked up the pieces passing tiring rivals in mid-stretch to be a solid third at the finish. SENSE
YOU LEFT was content to sit behind the pacesetter on the first turn, continued under restraint following the frontrunner along the backside, was looking for a
seam in the two path while in range turning for home but lacked a rally down the stretch posing no threat at the finish. DELPHIA tracked outside in the first
turn, offered mild pressure prompting outside down the back straight, bid for the lead two wide outside at the quarter pole when roused, had nothing more to
give by mid-stretch and emptied out late.

LUNCH WITH BERNIE broke outwardly bumping a rival lightly, rated in behind the leaders, saved ground on the turn, rallied inside to the lead a sixteenth
out and cleared. ECSTASY stalked from between runners in the second flight two to three wide, came out five wide by the top of the stretch, finished well to
get up for place. SPELLCHECK stalked from outside at the second flight, moved three to four wide on the turn taking the lead by the quarter pole, was
collared nearing the sixteenth pole and lost the nod for place. SHAKSHUKA settled mid-division inside, came out off the rail on the turn, moved out four wide
late on the turn then wider still later in the lane, kicked on mildly. RUSH TO GLORY reared at the start, shifted in, saved ground while racing at the back,
improved inside. BRAQUET was ridden along by the three-eighths racing mostly three to four wide, swung out further for the drive and ran on. VINE
GROVE settled outside a foe at the rear, was about four wide into the turn, shifted in near the quarter pole, kicked on mildly. PLAISIR D'AMOUR was lightly
bumped at the start, soon led, set the pace in the two path facing pressure from an outside rival, came up empty. CODED ENTRY broke a step slowly and
lost the path at the start, raced at the back off the inside, failed to menace. A. A. MINERVA pressed from outside three deep, was getting out past the
five-sixteenths all the way to the top of the stretch, came up empty.

Footnotes
LUZ DE LA LUNA was under a hold sitting behind the pacesetter down the backside, waited comfortably keeping pace behind the frontrunner throughout
the turn, pounced finding a seam in the two path in upper stretch, found another gear splitting foes by the sixteenth pole for the lead and was kept to the
task to hold off the fast closing runner up at the finish. STAR CANDY veered out on the break, then was allowed to settle on the rail trailing down the
backside, continued to patiently wait while in range of the leaders in last saving ground around the bend, found a seam four wide at the eighth pole, burst
between horses smartly with a sixteenth to run and was closing in quickly but ran out of ground with a solid stretch rally. OL' BLONDIE was coaxed mildly on
the rail to take the lead down the back straight, continued to set the fractions unopposed throughout the turn, opened up briefly by mid-stretch but could not
hold off the closing rivals in the final seventy yards fading to third at the wire. YA MAR prompted the pace outside down the backstretch, chased the
frontrunner around the turn, posed a threat in the three path straightening out for home but did not have enough late weakening between runners the last
sixteenth to settle on the fringes. LANTANA LADY tracked the pace three deep outside horses down the backside, edged closer three wide at the quarter
pole around rivals, was in the hunt in the four path at the top of the lane, could not go on and evened out at the furlong pole. SACRED DANCER stalked
between runners near the back in the early going, kept up with others travelling outside foes around the bend but could not find more turning for home and
was unable to get involved driving to the finish line.

FASHIONABLY FAB was alone comfortably watching the pacesetter along the backside, closed in to press the pace issue outside at the three eighths
marker, seized control by the quarter pole and drew away when roused by mid-stretch for the impressive score. TALK TO YA LATER trailed the field at the
start, brushed outside foe into the first turn, continued to see the field down the back straight, caught up to the pack inside at the top of the stretch, split foes
starting a late rally at the furlong pole and got up at the wire to nail second money on the line. TITO'S CALLING travelled in mid-pack on the fence in the first
turn, closed the gap to sit behind the leader at the half mile marker, was roused with five sixteenths to go shifting off the fence three wide, loomed in the four
path straightening out for the drive and gamely fought to the wire but was outdueled late just missing the place share in a photo at the wire. MY GIRL SKY
stalked near the rear in the beginning, was brushed by inside rival entering the first turn at the seven eighths marker, improved outside horses down the
backstretch taking closer order on the leaders by the half, made a brief run four wide around foes at the 1/4 pole to be in the mix turning for home and
willingly ran on the the finish but could not reach contention. STREGA cleared the field easily from the outside to take this field into the first turn running on
the rail, was uncontested setting the fractions down the backside, was pressed outside by the eventual winner at the three furlong pole, collared at the
quarter marker, offered no resistance up front and faltered on the fence in the final eighth.

O WOW was unhurried near the rear on the rail down the backside, crept closer advancing on the fence by the half mile marker, began to pick off runners
sharply travelling inside through the far turn, shifted in to the rail when coming up quickly on a stopping early leader at the furlong pole and was very strong
pulling away from rivals in deep stretch. MAKAYLA broke outwards on the start, settled in midfield by oneself down the backside, made a strong move
running on the rail midpoint on the far turn closing in on the leader, shifted out pouncing in the three path to have a brief lead nearing the furlong pole, could
not match strides with the winner late but held safe for second money at the finish line. BRIEF sat alone in the third flight in a strung out field down the
backstretch, rallied three wide outside horses midway on the far turn reeling in the tiring frontrunner, was in the hunt four wide straightening out for home
and finished up mildly in the last furlong to be a clear third at the line. TAKE CHANCES trailed the pack on the rail in the beginning, could see the field
finding her stride down the backstretch on the fence, commenced a rally picking off horses inside with five sixteenths left to go and continued with
momentum in the three path down the stretch to settle on the fringes in the end. MOON POOL stalked with runners on either side near the back in the early
going, was ahead of rivals down the back straight, made no progress on the far turn and swung out to the five path showing some late energy to pass tired
runners down the lane. SPEEDY JOHNY stalked three wide near the back on the first turn, improved on the outside three deep down the backstretch, was
hard ridden keeping pace with some rivals around the final bend to be in range for a share turning for home, could not sustain the run and stalled in upper
stretch. TOTAL BETTY chased the loose leader down the backside, was scrubbed on for more with five sixteenths remaining, offered little response, giving
way on the far turn and backed away through the field at the quarter pole. BRIDGE TO NOWHERE bobbled slightly on the start, quickly recovered to for the
lead into the first turn, set a brisk pace opening up on rivals down the backside, continued to roll on extending the advantage with three eighths left to go,
emptied out in upper stretch and stopped abruptly at the furlong pole.
