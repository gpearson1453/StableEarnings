Footnotes
CLUBHOUSE BRIDE dueled briefly outside WHERE IS ZIZI then cleared early, angled into the two path entering the turn, asked right handed past the
three-sixteenths pole and powered away from the runner-up. WHERE IS ZIZI broke well to take the early lead then ceded command to CLUBHOUSE
BRIDE, chased that rival three wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the stretch run but was clearly second best. CANDY KENDALL chased
three wide out of range into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, tipped four wide into the stretch and outkicked LOVME LIKEAFOOL for the
show honors. LOVME LIKEAFOOL chased two wide leaving the backstretch, moved to the rail around the bend, tipped back to the two path approaching
the stretch and got edged for the show. MUMBLES BROCKMAN broke a step slow, traveled at the back three wide exiting the backstretch, moved out
around the bend and failed to menace. SIGNORA VITTORIA broke a bit slow on the outside, raced outside a rival four wide into the turn, entered the lane
six wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ESCAPE ROUTE raced up close two wide into the turn, angled six wide around the bend, rallied widest and drew alongside the top pair past the eight pole,
took over past the sixteenth pole and drew clear near the wire. IT'S MY HOUSE pressed the pace from outside, moved up on even terms around the bend,
got carried wide approaching the stretch, battled down the lane, put a nose in front briefly at the sixteenth pole but was outkicked by the winner late.
MANITOWISH chased three then two wide on the turn, rallied inside the leaders and gained the show. PRINCIPE CARLO bumped inner rival soon after the
start, set the pace under pressure from IT'S MY HOUSE, dueled with that rival around the bend, drifted out approaching the stretch, fought head to head
into the final furlong, relinquished the lead at the sixteenth pole and yielded late. PHOSPHORESCENCE (FR) bumped with PRINCIPE CARLO then got
crowded between rivals early and dropped back to last, saved ground through the turn, finished willingly but could only whittle the gap late.

SATOSHI took a bump from BLUE CLOUD at the start, went up to press from inside, took over early on the turn, cleared outer rivals late on the bend,
drifted out in the lane and drew away late. BAJAN BASHERT prompted the pace three deep to the turn, vied four deep around the bend, chased after
SATOSHI six wide into the drive, drifted inward and hand to alter in further when coming up behind the leader, then faltered in deep stretch. PLUM CREEK
stumbled leaving the gate, chased off the rail early, put in a mild bid between rivals around the bend, could not kick on with SATOSHI past the
five-sixteenths pole and flattened in the furlong grounds. BLUE CLOUD veered in and bumped the winner in the beginning, trailed two wide through the turn
and failed to make an impact. C'MON LETS SWITCH away quickly while rank setting the early the pace with rivals on both sides, lost command early on the
turn, fought three deep midway around the bend, could not keep up with the winner and chased five wide into the lane, then faded in the drive.

DIAL A FRIEND set the pace three deep early, cleared around the bend, showed the way three wide into the stretch, roused at the three-sixteenths pole
and widened through the final furlong. HIGH FLYING GRACIE chased along the inside, had to pause briefly when in a bit tight approaching the
three-eighths pole, cut the corner into the lane, churned on down the lane and shared the place honors with COCONUT GIRL. COCONUT GIRL stalked off
the inside, spun five wide into the lane, finished willingly and could not be separated from HIGH FLYING GRACIE for second. JAZZY EMPRESS raced up
close on the inside, chased two then three wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. POP CHART chased three wide into the turn,
four wide into the lane and weakened. ALMOST GOT LUCKY forced out by LOVE HONOR AND PAY at the start, chased five, six, then seven wide on the
turn and was not a factor. VHAGAR vied for the lead inside DIAL A FRIEND to the turn, chased two wide around the bend and came up empty in the lane.
LOVE HONOR AND PAY veered out leaving the gate, tracked four wide into the turn, exited the bend five wide and failed to menace.

TAPATIO LEO set the pace up the backstretch, padded the lead around the turn, widened further when roused, started to drift inward entering the final
furlong, continued to drifted in late while seeing his lead diminish but held safely in the end. WILL BE broke a step slow, climbed a bit and dropped back off
the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, angled out in the lane and closed fast but could not reach the winner. SAWASDEE chased four wide into the
turn, eased out further while passing a rival on the turn, closest in pursuit six wide into the lane but flattened out in the final furlong. VORPAL broke a step
slow, unhurried early on, saved ground through the turn and failed to menace. CROWNING GOLD chased three then four wide on the turn and faded down
the lane.

Footnotes
MADISON RAE took control early from inside, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, fought with outer rivals around the far turn, inched ahead at
the top of the lane, cleared midstretch and held gamely to the wire. LORETTA LYNN broke a step slow, chased along the four path on the clubhouse turn,
bid three deep at the three-eighths pole, five wide into the lane, failed to find the needed late kick in the furlongs grounds but edged ASADA FRIES for the
place honors. ASADA FRIES chased in the two path through both turns, bumped repeatedly with PETIT FILET near the three-sixteenths pole, finished
willingly late but got edged by LORETTA LYNN for second. PETIT FILET stalked three wide early, moved up to apply pressure from outside in the middle
stages, vied between three then four wide on the second bend, bumped repeatedly with ASADA FRIES near the three-sixteenths pole and weakened in the
late stages. PUTT FOR DOUGH toss her head, veered out and almost lost her rider at the start, GUTIERREZ managed to regain his right iron and trailed
three then four wide on the clubhouse turn, chased within range on second turn two, three, then four wide but flattened out in the lane. THE RIDER OF
PETIT FILET LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST ASADA FRIES FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE
STEWARDS RULED THAT BOTH RIVALS CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT AND NO CHANGE WOULD BE MADE.
