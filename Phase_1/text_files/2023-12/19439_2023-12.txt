Footnotes
NO MORE DEBT prompted the pace in the three path, bid midway around the far turn, led from the three path int the stretch, and held on gamely. GLOBES
raced up close in the four path, was roused into the far turn, floated out to the six path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. ENSIGN SKIP bumped with an
inner foe at the start, rated in the four path, tipped out to the six path under a drive turning into the lane, and finished evenly for show. HOLIDAY FANTASY
raced off the pace in the five path, had to steady in the three path midway around the far turn, tipped inwards to the two path in upper stretch, but made no
impact. LAW OF THE JUNGLE chased in the two path, was driven into the stretch, but was no factor. SIMPLY JACK set the pace in the two path, was
roused into the far turn, but faded in the stretch. TRAVEL GUIDE bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the four path, and did not threaten in the
six path down the lane. NOWITZKI stalked in the five path but was empty turning into the stretch. MATEO tracked inside but backed up early into the far
turn. ADORIAN raced in midpack along the inside, was pulled up early into the backstretch, and vanned off.

miss third. OSCAR AWARD steadied along inside around the first turn, made some progress two wide between foes entering the far turn, bumped with
HARRINGTON midway around that bend, angled back in, had a rail bid in upper stretch and flattened out. TREASURE KING dueled three wide around the
first turn and two wide around the far turn, vied to midstretch and tired. ANAMNESTIC hit the starting gate and was off last, trailed in the three path around
the first turn, went five wide around the far turn and improved position between foes in the lane. AMBOR NIGHT raced well back two and three wide, swung
eight wide in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. MCMONEY saved ground off the pace, went five wide around the far turn, angled nine wide turning for

Footnotes
HADES got bumped by an outer foe into an inner foe at the start, trailed in the three path, was ridden in the two path around the turn, swung out to the six
path turning into the stretch, and rallied on his left lead to be up in the final strides. ARROGANCY broke in at the start, prompted the pace in the three path,
bid between foes midway around the turn, ran on to stick his head in front passing the eighth pole, but was caught in the closing stages by an outer foe to
place. FAR FROM A STAR bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace just off the rail inside of foes, was roused into the turn, was challenged by an
outer foe passing the three-eighths, dug in along the inside into the stretch, but was outfinished by an outer pair late to show. MIGHTY MEKONG chased
inside, and finished evenly from the two path on his left lead in the stretch. MISTER COOPER stalked in the four path, but faded on his left lead from the five
path down the lane. STREET EARNINGS raced off the pace in the four path, fanned out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and made no impact.
SPIN THE BOULEVARD broke in and bumped an inner foe, tracked in the two path, but had to steady going into the far turn, and never menaced.

VERRAZANOINTHESKY raced off the pace in the three path, was driven along the inside around the turn, tipped back out to the three path at the top of the
lane, rallied past the inner pacesetter passing the sixteenth, and went clear. THE LAST FACT set the pace in the two path, was ridden into the turn, opened
slightly in upper stretch, but faded in the final furlong to place. EARTH tracked in the two path, was driven around the turn, shifted out to the seven path
turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. ABE HONESTLY pressed inside, was steadied passing the quarter to angle out to the five path in upper
stretch, but faded. RESIST THE DEVIL chased in the five path, steadied nearing the quarter to avoid the fallen jockey, and was eased thru the stretch. LEE
ANN'S WARRIOR stalked in the three path, was coaxed into the turn, but ducked outward passing the quarter losing the rider, was caught shortly after the
wire and walked off. LUNAR ROCKET trailed in the four path, was pulled up turning into the stretch, and walked off. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER
THE STEWARDS HELD AN INQUIRY TO LOOK AT THE RUNNING AROUND THE QUARTER POLE.

Footnotes
OZARA (IRE) tracked the pace two wide between foes, angled four wide in upper stretch, closed outside, took over leaving the sixteenth pole and held firm
inside of the runner-up. MILLIAT (IRE) broke a step slowly, trailed inside early, edged closer two wide around the far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch
and finished strongly. GREAT VENEZUELA set the pace in the two path, responded to a bid from BUTTERCREAM BABE nearing the quarter pole,
re-cleared in upper stretch, led past the sixteenth pole and held third. BUTTERCREAM BABE prompted the pace three wide, bid nearing the quarter pole,
continued on the left lead in the lane and was outfinished. MADAME MISCHIEF settled off the pace while racing two wide, went four wide around the far
turn and had a mild stretch gain. CAIRO STREET went evenly inside. DONE ENOUGH had early speed at the rail, checked near the five-eighths marker,
steadied again soon after, continued to chase inside around the far turn and weakened in the lane. BEACH CRUISER was bumped at the start, chased the
pace three and four wide and lacked a closing bid. GOOD BRIGHT FLAMES failed to menace while racing two and three wide. MIST bumped at the start,
raced off the pace two and three wide and made little further impact.

passing the eighth pole, and was driven clear. SEA STREAK tracked in the four path, tipped out to the five path under a drive turning into the lane, and kept
on to be up for place. CHISPARRAJOS bumped with an inner foe at the start, vied for the lead in the four path, took a short advantage in the three path
rounding the turn, but flattened down the lane to show. MUGATU raced off the pace in the five path but never threatened in the six path down the lane.
SAINT NO MORE dueled for the lead in the two path, was driven along the inside around the turn, but faded in the stretch, was pulled up on the gallop out
and vanned off. ORB ALPHA bumped with an outer foe at the start, always trailed around the two path.

FLY THE W stalked in the five path, was under coaxing in the four path around the turn, swung out to the seven path turning into the lane, stayed on while
on his left lead in upper stretch, switched leads around the final sixteenth, and got up in the final strides. TIZ ROMANTIC set the pace in the four path, was
roused from the three path early around the turn, floated out to the five path turning into the stretch, and ran on, but was caught by an outer foe in the final
strides to place. BRYCE CANYON raced off the pace in the two path, was urged along the rail around the turn, tipped out to the three path at the top of the
lane, and kept on for show. UNCLE ARMANDO tracked in the two path, was driven along the inside turning into the stretch, but flattened. GLIDING AFLEET
rated in the three path but never threatened. WIND NINETY NINE trailed throughout around the two path.

Footnotes
NIC'S STYLE was bumped soon after the start, set the pace in the two path and drew off handily. GIRVIN GIRL pressed the winner in the three path, was
no match for that foe but kept on to hold the place. DIVINE CONNECTION raced in range four wide, could not keep pace with the winner from the quarter
pole and was outfinished for the place. ADIOS BABE failed to menace while racing five wide. PRINCIPIA chased the pace inside and faded through the
lane. SILVIA V'S HEROES played no factor while racing two wide. MAJOR PRYCE had her head turned at the start and was never in contention while
racing five wide. AWESOME ANNMARIE threw her head at the start, hit the gate and was off very slowly, raced three wide and never threatened.
ATALANTA ALEXANDRA bumped the winner soon after the start and was outrun while racing in the two path.
