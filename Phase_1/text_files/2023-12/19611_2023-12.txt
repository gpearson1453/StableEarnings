Footnotes
PRIDDIS settled off the pace and the inside, advanced to challenge three wide in the second turn, drove clear when straightened for home under a pair of
right handed crops. HISSY MISSY broke alertly, pressed the leader from the outside, challenged that one through the second turn, proved no match for the
winner in the drive, clearly second best. WEST SIDE GIRL lacked speed while well wide into the first turn, continued outside and was four wide again
through the second bend when making a mild advance, flattened out in the drive in doing little with the top two, far clear of the others. MIZ CALI away in
good order, set the pace inside, began to weaken when headed by the runner up far turn, continued falter through the stretch. CARICIA broke back, void of
speed, angled three wide late in the final turn, improved position with some mild late interest while no real threat. SWEET DYNASTY lagged back start,
trailed, passed some tiring rivals while also not posing a threat. EVERYOTHERWON settled in mid pack, had nothing for the stretch run. SASSY SAGEY
was never involved. EMITYAAZ forwardly placed in the early going along the inside, began a steady retreat after a half.

Footnotes
MUSIC MISTRESS forwardly placed while toward the inside early, angled out four wide turning for home, collared the loose early leader inside the furlong
marker, edged clear in the waning strides. HUMOR ME JIM broke alertly, set a clear pace just off the inside, continued clear past midstretch, could not
contain the winner. SUMMER OF MISCHIEF chased the runner up in the three path, began to weaken turning for home. KEY TO SUCCESS settled in the
midpack in the three path, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve position. GREEK HEIRESS floated into the gap, steadied early, raced
back, saved ground turn, traffic into the stretch, improved position with some interest when clear. GHOST BAYOU forwardly placed early while outside, four
wide through the turn, tired. SWEET MOTHER MARY three wide in the main body, traffic midway on the turn, went evenly through the stretch. PIVOSKY
bumped at the start, one paced, lacked bid. THISONESFORLOVE bumped, broke back, void of speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a
factor. BEAUTIFUL AND BOLD lacked speed, four to five wide through the turn, little for drive. AMARETTO DI AMORE moved closer five wide through the
turn, gave way. CALY BALI was finished early.

Footnotes
LUNDBERG with the pace just off the inside, continued to show the way into the lane, edged clear late then held the runner up safe in the final strides.
GUCCI BOY back off the pace well out in the strip, raced four wide through the turn, set down the final furlong, displayed some good late energy to be
getting to the winner late. SAFE BET pressed the issue early, dueled in the three path through the turn outside the winner, first to blink nearing the furlong
marker, saved the show. DARVESH broke back, moved up in the two path, saved ground into the stretch, went flat the final furlong. SHARP STICK fell back
trail after the start, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing response. VIOLENT RIVER in mid pack early, moved off the inside late in the turn, came up
empty for the stretch run. BOURBON ON FIRE remained back in failing to threaten. LIGHT HORSE HARRY moved up to vie in the early going while
between horses, stopped through the stretch.

Footnotes
MR. COMMANDER broke alertly, set the pace while racing toward the inside, remained clear through the lane under steady handling. DANCIN ROCKET
forwardly placed along the inside, continued to prompt the winner into the stretch, shuffled bit turn, could not get back to that same rival through the lane,
second best. DALTON'S RUTROW bothered slightly at the start, lodged a bold move while six wide into the turn, challenged outside the winner turning into
the lane, faltered a bit late to be overtaken for the place, lasted for the show. GREAT BARRIER forwardly placed early off the inside, lacked a meaningful
response through the stretch, not enough for the show. PREACHER'S KID raced in mid pack while toward the inside, went evenly through the stretch.
NACHO CHROME off a step slow, continued to lag behind the field, angled out a bit late in the turn and improved position with some belated interest.
SINGING GROOM broke outward, lacked speed off the inside, four wide into the turn, improved through upper stretch then flattened out. MOTOWN
COLLECTION back early off the pace, five wide when advancing through the turn, hung in the drive. DARIO in mid pack while four to five wide turn, lacked
a closing kick. LUCKY SUPER NOVA was finished early. SCRIMSHIRE tired while racing three wide. STATE SCHOOL SMART gave way into the turn,
stopped and was outdistanced soon after when losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
THREEFIFTYSEVEN outrun in the early going, closer in traffic into the lane, waited, set down for the drive when clear, rallied through traffic, continued to be
good resolve to be up in the final strides. MEAN JAKEY broke alertly, narrowly set the pace, continued to hold a narrow advantage late turn, shook clear
when strai. INFILTRATOR void of speed in the three path early, angled in a bit midway on the turn, set down in the two path, split foes inside the furlong
marker, finished up willingly to miss the place. CITY OF CLOUDS in the second flight while racing in the two path, lodged a bid for the second spot past the
furlong marker, flattened in the late going. SUPER CONSTITUTION in the main group while along the inside, rail bid for the second spot in mid stretch, also
found lacking. CAPTAIN JACK with the early pace between foes, dueled inside the runner up through the turn, weakened in the late going. GUIDED
ARROW in tight then steadied along the rail backstretch, moved out three wide, came up empty for the drive. LEMON DROP SHOT lacked speed, in some
traffic early in the turn, three wide through the bend, lacked a closing kick. AL'S ROMEO rank, steadied in some early traffic, remained back. HI YAH
steadied early in traffic, advanced four wide turn, failed to sustain that effort drive. HUSKER BUTCH was finished early while four to five wide turn.

Footnotes
HIGH CLASS broke in good order, with the pace immediately, dueled into and through the turn, shook off the other speed when straightened for home,
enough left to narrowly last. CHANDANA bothered at the break, was righted to race in the second flight while four wide, continued to stalk on the outside
through the turn, set down for the drive, steady gain while remaining widest through the lane, narrowly missed. I'M THE BOSS OF ME dueled up front while
in the two path and outside the winner, weakened a bit in the lane, clear for the show. DEALING JUSTICE last away, continued to lack speed toward the
inside, came in the two path for the drive, improved position without posing a serious threat to the top three. TOPSY broke out to bother the runner up, was
straightened to race within striking distance three wide, dropped to the inside by late in the turn, came up empty for the stretch run.
MARGOINABUBBLEBATH chased the dueling leaders off the inside for a half, had little left for the stretch run. SHE'S STORMING fell back after the start,
was never a threat.

Footnotes
BACKYARD MONEY broke alertly from the outside, set the early pace, eased clear through the turn in the two path, steadily drew out under pressure
through the lane. PATE lacked early foot outside, five to four wide when advancing turn, proved determined for the place late while not a threat to the
winner. HONEY RUN off bit slow, back off the pace while out in the strip, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, closest to the winner a furlong out while
remaining out in the strip, outkicked late for the runner up spot. ALWAYS ANGELS in the second flight early, shuffled back into the turn in some traffic to
lose position, came in the two path for the drive, rallied to improve position, no real threat. FASHION RAGE settled in mid pack off the inside, raced three
wide through the lane, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing kiick. TYRONA off slowly, lacked speed while moving out, three to four wide turn,
staged a mild rally down the middle of the strip. WILDWOOD BYE in the second group while four wide, turned in and even effort. LITTLE SISTER SUE
saved ground to no avail. ABBY THE BULL DAWG off a bit slow, trailed much of the way, made little impact in picking off a couple of tiring rivals.
MISSYINTOMISCHIEF forwardly placed for a half, backed up through the stretch. LACEY BOSS remained always back to be outrun. CAUMSETT
pressured the winner early along the inside, stopped in the drive.
