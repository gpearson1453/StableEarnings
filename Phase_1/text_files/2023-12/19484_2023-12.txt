angled out to the seven path under a ride turning into the lane, was herded in slightly around the sixteenth, and kept on for show. FLASHOVER vied for the
lead in the three path, stuck a head in front early into the turn, held a clear advantage while floating out to the five path at the top of the stretch, but faded in
the final furlong. ANADOLU pressed the pace in the four path, was roused to bid going into the turn, but weakened in the stretch. BOLKIN bumped with an
outer foe at the start, led in the two path early, but lost the lead to an outer foe while along the inside early around the turn, and gaveway.

took over near the sixteenth pole and held firm. CHLOE'S TOY stalked the pace in the three path, steadily gained through the lane but was outkicked.
GRACE CANDY set the pace in the two path and yielded near the sixteenth pole. ROBYN AND ELI was off a step slow, trailed inside then had a mild gain
at the rail in the lane. LOVE RHAPSODY chased the pace two and three wide and lacked a closing bid. AVE FENIX was outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
BURNAWAY raced up close in the two path, bid inside of the leader going into the far turn, took the lead from the two path into the stretch, drifted out late,
but held sway. BRITISH EMPRESS stalked in the five path, bid under a ride around the far turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and ran
on for place. NAA DUDETTE chased in the two path, was driven along the rail around the far turn, and kept on in the two path down the lane for show.
DIGITAL TRADE bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the three path, swung out to the six path turning into the stretch, and stayed on between
foes. STARLIT SOFI chased in the four path, tipped out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but made no impact. PALACE FLIRT raced off the pace in
the three path, fanned out to the ten path turning into the lane, and failed to bid. STREET CHARITY bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace from
the four path into the backstretch, was headed by the inner eventual winner early around the far turn, and gaveway passing the eighth pole. ARISAEMA was
unhurried in the four path early, tipped out to the nine path under a ride turning into the lane, but could not factor. LOOKINGFORTREASURE raced wellback
in the two path and never threatened. FANCY STAX trailed throughout around the four path.

Footnotes
STORM BRAVE rated up close in the two path, drew off under mild urging and widened under minimal urging in the final sixteenth. NATURE BOY was
bumped at the start, advanced inside down the backstretch, tracked at the rail around the turn, was no match for the winner in the lane but stayed on to hold
the place. EYES OF CHAMPION pressed the pace in the four path, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch but kept on to maintain the
show. IMPULSIVENESS was devoid of speed, saved ground and passed tiring rivals. ASTRAL WEEKS set the pace in the three path and tired in the
stretch. HELLO JACK broke a bit awkwardly and lightly bumped NATURE BOY, chased the pace four and five wide and came up empty in the lane.
FEDERAL EXCHANGE was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
DEMOGORGON rated in the five path, ranged up around the far turn to bid in the four path passing the quarter, was carried out to the eight path at the top
of the lane, dueled with an inner foe into final furlong, and prevailed. SANDPIPER MEMORIES bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the four
path, bid passing the half, took the lead under a ride in the three path early around the far turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the stretch, dug in to
duel with the outer winner down the stretch, but was outlasted to place. DON'T GET PICKLED bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the five path,
fanned out to the nine path under a drive turning into the lane, and finished evenly for show. BLETCHLEY GIRL tracked in the three path, tipped out to the
five path under a ride turning into the lane, but flattened. KHOSEA set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside into the far turn, but faded
turning into the stretch. GOLDEN VOICE prompted the pace in the three path but weakened turning into the stretch. ROSE E HOLIDAY raced off the pace
in the two path but was no menace.

Footnotes
BE LUCKY set the pace in the three path, was nudged along from the two path into the turn, cued from the three path into the stretch, and held on. MR.
AMERICAN tracked in the four path, was roused passing the quarter, rallied between foes from the five path into the final furlong, but ran out of time to end
up with place. KERN RIVER prompted the pace in the five path, was coaxed in the four path passing the quarter, floated out to the seven path under urging
in upper stretch, and finished evenly for show. ROMPING RUNNER rated in the three path, had to steady going into the turn, then had to wait for room
around the turn, was roused along the inside into the lane, but flattened on his left lead. ONE FAST DREAM chased in the two path, was under coaxing
while inside of foes around the turn, tipped out to the four path entering the stretch, but also flattened. VINICIO hopped at the start, raced off the pace in the
five path, fanned out to the eight path under a drive turning into the lane, but did not threaten.
