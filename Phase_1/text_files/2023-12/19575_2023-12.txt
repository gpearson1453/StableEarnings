early, advanced inside and finished strongly too late. ZOPPI FISCHBEIN far behind early, rallied on the turn, angled out in the stretch and closed.
GAMERUN pursued the dueling pacesetters early then made a gradual gain in the stretch. SMART AND FAST settled off the pace in the two path, moved
very wide in the stretch. AYE dropped far behind inside then passed rivals without menacing. SKYHOOK was urged outside in the second flight then gave
way in the stretch. KEEP DEM TALKING lacked speed outside and was never a factor. KIDMAN KERRY flashed speed along the inside to the far turn and

Footnotes
THIRSTY PAPPY tracked the dueling leaders, bid three wide on the far turn, took over coming to the quarter pole, then yielded to SCAMP WALKER, dug in
gamely inside of that rival past the furlong marker and battled back determinedly to prevail. SCAMP WALKER raced two wide off the pace, moved up on the
far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, gained a short lead in upper stretch, then was outfinished in the final sixteenth. MAJESTIC LION was outrun
early, moved up three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside and got the nod for third. FICTIONALFAIRYTALE raced off the pace
inside, advanced inside on the far turn, angled out, rallied mildly and just missed for the show spot. IMPETUD was reluctant to load, raced off the pace,
chased on the far turn and failed to threaten. PARTY NEWS was outrun early, advanced at the quarter pole and passed tired rivals. NICKEL NICKEL raced
three wide early, vied two wide for the lead, dueled and faded. WILKINSON WARRIOR vied inside for the lead, dueled on the backside and gave way on the
far turn.

VOLATILITY pressured briefly, began pulling away before the half then drew off eagerly in a dominating score while ridden out. ME SO LUCKY lagged far
behind then advanced inside to gain the place. MAMMA MIA ESTERINA trailed for half a mile, moved very wide then flattened out in the stretch. WINE
GODDESS raced in clear off the leaders, was urged into the far turn and had a mild response. JAMAICAN MI HAZEL broke slowly and dropped back, saved
ground and was no factor. MUCHO MISSTIQUE pursued within striking range for half mile and gave way. THREE CUPS FULL offered brief speed inside
then stopped abruptly losing contact with her field.

DESANTIS raced three wide early, then stalked two wide, bid on the far turn, dueled briefly, took over at the quarter pole, drew clear and held well under
urging. SAILOR'S RETURN raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, dug in gamely outside in the final furlong, but
second best. BRINDISI hopped at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace, chased on the far turn, rallied mildly inside in the stretch for third. DAD'S ON A
ROLL raced three wide early, settled off the pace, advanced on the far turn and closed belatedly outside. LIAM'S BLUE MOON set the pace on the inside,
dueled on the far turn and faded. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM tracked on the inside, then chased and gave way. SMARTHUMOR raced off the pace inside
and was outrun.

lead, shook free, dueled into the stretch and then weakened gradually. YES SIR COLONEL raced off the rail, off the pace, came three wide into the lane
and lacked a rally. PREDOMINATE raced off the rail, off the pace, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. COBBLE ROAD vied inside for the
lead, then chased and faded. FINALIST was fractious in the gate, raced off the pace inside and did not factor. DADASHEV tracked on the inside, then
chased and gave way. I AM THAT I AM was fractious in the gate, raced three wide early, settled off the pace and failed to respond.

FRANKIE'S EMPIRE trailed early, began rallying on the turn, advanced inside in the stretch and surged to the front in the final sixteenth. KELLY'S KIDZ held
a narrow lead in the opening quarter, resisted when hooked and continued gamely to the wire. MAXIMUS MERIDIUS rushed to contention early, dueled to
the front midway on the turn to the late yards. TWILIGHT DANCER raced close up wide down the backstretch, faded briefly then came again outside. HIS
RIGHTS dropped far behind then caught tiring opponents. YULETIDE GALLOP prompted the pace inside to the far turn and gave way. CIGALE chased
along the inside and weakened steadily.
