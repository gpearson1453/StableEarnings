Footnotes
BEACHLAND tracked in the three path, was nudged along inside of foes around the turn, ridden from the two path into the lane, rallied past an outer trio into
the final furlong, and drew clear. UP FOR IT bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the four path, tipped to the three path early around the turn, was
roused while shifting out to the six path turning into the lane, and ran on for place. OOLONG HAI (IRE) was sent to set the pace inside of rivals in the two
path, cued while tipping out to the four path turning into the stretch, began to fade after the eighth pole, but held show. MYSTIC SUNRISE trailed in the four
path, merged into the two path and was roused early around the turn, but was carried out to the nine path turning into the stretch, stayed on, but just missed
getting up for minor placings. SICKLE DANCE bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the four path, was under coaxing in the three
path passing the quarter, floated out to the five path at the top of the stretch, but had to steady just after the eighth pole, and flattened. GOLDEN STAR
pressed in the five path, was driven in the four path around the turn, floated out to the eight path going into the stretch, and weakened.

IF NOT FOR LUCK stalked the pace three and four bid, bid in upper stretch, vied outside and inched ahead late. ROLLING ON raced without hind shoes,
set a pressured pace inside, fought on inside of the winner to the wire but was outfinished. BELLA FUTURE stalked the pace in the two path, angled to the
rail in upper stretch, bid inside foes in midstretch and was outkicked. LOYAL LOUIE pressed the pace in the three path between foes, bid in upper stretch
but was in tight between the top two and lost his path leaving the eighth pole. NO NAME DUDE went evenly while racing three wide. COMMANDANT was
bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside and never threatened. DEVILS ONLY FRIEND was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide, swung
widest in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. FAST FIXER broke through the gate prior to the start and was outrun while racing four wide.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY FANTASY raced prominently outside the leader in the two path, bid between foes passing the three-eighths, narrowly led from an outer foe while
drifting out to the five path in upper stretch, and inched clear late under a drive. SHA TIN prompted the pace around the three path, bid three-wide passing
the three-eighths, was herded out to the six path by the inner eventual winner in upper stretch, kept on, but was repelled to place. TAPINTOYOURBEER
tracked in the two path, was cued early into the turn, tipped out to the four path midway around the turn, and was one-paced in the five path down the lane
for show. DANLEY trailed in the four path, was coaxed from the two path into the turn, but did not threaten in the stretch. TUWAIM chased in the five path
but failed to menace. ACAMAR broke out at the start, set the pace inside, was challenged by an outer pair passing the three-eighths, and gaveway turning
into the stretch.

NICO'S HAVING FUN stalked the pace inside, tipped out in upper stretch, closed outside of the pacesetter and won going away. PRIX DE WEST set the
pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and yielded in deep stretch. GINGERSNAP JACK saved ground off the pace, angled four wide
near the quarter pole and was along for the show. HONOR GOLD raced off the early pace, advanced three wide around the turn and flattened out in the
lane. HANDSOME RUNNER prompted the pace two and three wide and tired in the drive. MARVINO was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
LUCKY CURLIN saved ground in range, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths marker, closed between foes, took over near the eighth pole and edged
ahead under a drive. NOVO SOL (BRZ) was bumped at the start and then again soon after, raced off the pace two and three wide, angled further out in
upper stretch and rallied for the place. MAILMAN MONEY prompted the pace two wide, bid in upper stretch and was outkicked. TARTUFO raced in range
three and four wide and was one-paced through the lane. TWELVE VOLT MAN was bumped soon after the start, saved ground off the pace, tipped out in
upper stretch and was no threat. NIGHT JUMPER set the pace inside, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired in the final furlong. HOT BLOODED
broke inwardly and bumped NOVO SOL at the start, raced three wide around the first turn, edged closer five wide around the far turn and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
ESPERON set the pace in the two path, was cued midway around the turn, dug in from the two path into the stretch, but began to drift out in the final
furlong, bumped an outer foe after a left handed cue around the final sixteenth, and just held on. OKIRO bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked
inside, was roused along the rail rounding the turn, tipped out to the three path to bid at the top of the stretch, ran on, but got herded out around the eighth
pole and bumped at the sixteenth to finish with place. KING OF THE TRACK tracked in the two path, was coaxed passing the quarter, floated out to the five
path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. RUNNIN' ROCKET bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the three path, was cued passing the quarter,
shifted out to the six path under a drive in upper stretch, and kicked on. KING SKULL trailed in the two path, was driven around the turn, angled out to the
nine path in upper stretch, but made no impact. SPIRIT'S MISCHIEF vied for the lead in the three path, was put to coaxing early around the turn, but failed
to respond, and faded in the stretch. PRIVATE THOUGHTS chased in the four path, was ridden from the two path into the stretch, and did not threaten.
SHEA D WORLD pressed in the five path, floated out to the seven path turning into the lane, and yielded. AFTER AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE
RIDER OF OKIRO AGAINST THE RIDER OF ESPERON AS WELL AS A STEWARDS INQUIRY, ESPERON WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AN
PLACED SECOND FOR DRIFTING OUT AND BUMPING OKIRO INSIDE THE FINAL FURLONG IMPEDING OKIRO FROM A FAIR CHANCE TO GET
BY.
