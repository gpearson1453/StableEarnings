Footnotes
EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN was squeezed at the start to trail down the backside, commenced his rally splitting runners at the quarter pole, swung outside in
the four path with good run at the top of the lane and closed in strongly to collar the embattled leaders at the seventy yard pole, clearing off at the finish.
SMART COVERAGE had a brief lead on the rail in the beginning, chased the pacesetter inside at the three furlong marker, angled just outside in the two
path looming boldly at the eighth pole, was laying in driving to the wire and just got up for second money crossing the finish line. ANARCHY prompted the
pace three wide outside in the beginning, began to edge away for a clear lead at the three furlong pole, maintained a comfortable advantage turning for
home, was asking for the wire just holding onto the lead inside at the sixteenth pole and faded in deep stretch just missing the save for the place share at
the wire. EXECUTIVE SIGHT was situated on the rail having one rival beat down the backside, improved on the fence passing foes through the turn and
finished up with intent on the fence to garner a minor share in the end. LAKE SHORE DRIVE was in the mix up front between the two leaders down the
backside, could not match strides with the top pair at the three eighths marker and yielded to others in the final furlong. TOURIST'S DREAM watched the
top three leaders outside down the backstretch, made little headway four wide outside horses on the turn and was not interested running down the stretch.
WOOD BE WILD tracked the top three running inside foes down the back straight, made no impact around the oval and could not get involved in the stretch
run to be a factor. HIGHLAND SOCIETY stalked near the rear outside rivals down the backstretch, could not keep up with horses through the turn and came
up empty in the drive to the finish line.

Footnotes
COACH ABERNATHY stalked in the two path with horses on either side down the backstretch, took closer order patiently weaving through runners on the
far turn, shifted outside in the five path straightening out for home and found his best stride late to close in for the victory in deep stretch. GOOD SOLDIER
stalked near the rear on the inside in the early going, advanced smartly running in hand on the rail at the half, burst between foes making a good move at
the top of the lane and ran on determinedly on the fence, besting the rest at the finish line. GLENHOLME was in a good spot galloping along alone in third
place down the backside, assumed command passing the tiring frontrunner midway on the final bend, was clinging to the lead at the furlong marker and
fade late in deep stretch to be a clear third at the wire. BILL NEEDLE settled in mid-pack three wide outside runners down the backstretch, rallied smartly
three wide around runners at the three eighths pole, chased the leader in the four path driving to the wire and ran on mildly to the finish holding on for a
minor role in the end. SOCIAL JUSTICE was unhurried trailing down the backside, continued to see the field running around the far turn, swung out seven
wide outside all rivals at the top of the stretch and finished up willingly down the lane. GROOM LAKE travelled in midfield between rivals down the backside,
was urged with runners on each side at the three eighths pole, shifted out in the five path to be in the mix for a small piece of the prize straightening out for
the drive but needed more late to be a presence at the wire. DAWSON SILVER stalked three deep outside foes at the half, kept pace with rivals three wide
on the final bend, angled outside in the six path at the top of the lane and could not make any impact in the stretch drive. TWIXTER was content tracking the
loose pacesetter down the backside, could not accelerate with pothers making a move at the three eighths marker and backed away turning for home.
CHICAGO FREDDY caught a flyer leading this field into the first turn, opened up on the pack down the back straight, was collared outside midway on the far
turn, offered no resistance and stopped on the fence in upper stretch.

TELLTALE tracked the top two on the rail at the half, quickly moved in on the fence closing on the frontrunner midpoint on the turn, took control at the top of
the stretch and was easily going away opening up on the field at the wire. SMILES FOR DAVID had one foe beaten down the backside, closed the gap on
the leaders running around the oval, shifted to the four path for the stretch drive and stubbornly won the battle for second money in deep stretch. HOT
OMELET veered out sharply at the break, tracked alone in the third flight down the backstretch, circled runners three wide midway on the turn and gamely
dueled between horses to the wire just losing out on the place award at the finish. KRYPTO GAINS had a slim lead outside down the backstretch, opened
up on the field briefly with three furlongs to go, was collared by the winner in upper stretch and faded at the furlong marker to settle on the fringes crossing
the finish line. I'M EXCEPTIONAL was steadied sharply at the start, trailing by many along the backside, continued to see the field throughout the turn and
showed some good late energy passing some rivals through the stretch run. TURF AND SURF pressed the issue inside the leader down the back straight,
was checked mildly at the three furlong marker, shuffled back through the running on the turn and finished up evenly on the fence down the stretch.
EXECUTIVE EFFECT tracked the front duo two wide outside foes at the half, kept pace just behind the leaders around the bend and faltered between
horses at the furlong marker. GAV'S DREAM GIRL was bumped soundly soon after the start, unseating the rider and walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRY
REGARDING THE START OF THE RACE RESULTED IN #2 HOT OMELET BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST FOR INTEREFERENCE AT THE

Footnotes
SILENT FORTUNE attended the pace from outside three to four wide pressing the issue into the turn, bid at the quarter pole, kicked clear in mid-stretch.
VERY DEBONAIRE pressed briefly from inside then eased back off the leading pair content to track, saved ground early on the turn, tipped out late on that
bend coming past the quarter pole three to four wide, kept on in the stretch to secure the place. SPANISH SERENADE was not too far back of the leaders
racing between rivals, was ridden along coming to the quarter pole and in closer range four deep, needed more late. ADELAIDE COURT appeared a bit
warm in the saddling enclosure, bumped with a rival at the start, moved forward and forced the pace from between runners early under encouragement and
with a narrow lead, was hounded by the outside rival into the turn racing just off the fence, was overtaken by that one at the top of the stretch, faded in the
lane. YORKVILLE was under a bit of a hold up the backstretch in behind runners, shifted out and advanced outside on the turn coming six deep to the
quarter pole, ran on in the stretch but needed more. BENLION moved forward inside under some encouragement tracking from mid-pack into the turn,
switched out a bit past the five-sixteenths coming to the top of the stretch in the two to three path in behind, ran on one-paced. RIVER OF BABYLON
exchanged contact with a rival and was consequently away slowly, lacked early speed shifting in bringing up the rear racing inside into the turn, moved out a
bit from the rail and passed tired rivals. BUTWAITTHERE'SMORE was up close briefly chasing in behind two to three deep, steadily dropped back, shifted
four to five wide into the stretch, failed to rally. SNOOKERED saved ground inside, failed to menace. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ advanced four to five wide
on the turn reaching striking distance six wide at the top of the stretch and under all out urging, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
NAPA SPIRIT (IRE) had a slim advantage inside down the backstretch, emerged with a clear lead at the half, put away the chasing foe running around the
bend and had more in reserve through the stretch to comfortably hold off rivals to the wire. BIG INVESTMENT pressed the pace with runners on each side
in the beginning, was relegated to track the front two at the half inside, kept pace with the frontrunner on the turn and stubbornly battled to the wire to just
hold in a photo for second money. GHOUL (BRZ) travelled on the rail stalking near the back of the pack in the early stages, picked up runners splitting foes
midway on the turn, shifted inwards, closing in on the rail by mid-stretch and just missed the nod for place at the wire. FORESTER'S TURN settled three
wide outside horses in midfield, rallied four wide around foes on the turn, angled out to the five path for a chance for a piece of the prize at the top of the
lane and won the battle for the minors in deep stretch. JAMIESTA tracked in the second flight on the outside at the half, was hard ridden two wide between
horses at the quarter pole to be in the hunt in the four path straightening for home, showed some late interest to the wire but just missed being a fringe
player when crossing the finish line. BIG TIME LOUIE prompted the pace three wide on the outside down the back straight, chased the winner in vain
outside throughout the turn, had no more to give at the top of the lane and tired between rivals in the last furlong. ROCKSTAR RO stalked near the rear
down the backstretch, improved mildly on the fence saving ground around the turn, was in range for a minor role in upper stretch but levelled off at the
furlong pole inside. WENJACK co-trailed outside in the beginning, could not gain on rivals running four wide through the turn, angled outside in the six path
turning for home but had little to offer down the stretch. EXCEED co-trailed on the inside in the early going, lost touch with the field running around the bend
and was not a factor in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
BOXER BRIEF moved forward tracking the leading pair from inside a rival saving ground early on the turn, moved out four wide coming past the quarter
pole, bid and took a narrow lead in upper stretch, held off a late challenge from. HARDWARE GAP , who settled in behind the leading pair stalking from
outside the aforementioned winner, moved in tandem with that one while shifting out late on the turn, lost a jump or so to that rival but fought on gamely to
draw nearly even a sixteenth from home but was held off. CONFUSING broke awkwardly and a bit slowly, moved up between foes two wide on the turn,
shifted out five to six deep in the stretch, was gaining but too late. GENDRAGON was outsprinted early, raced three then four wide on the turn at the back,
came out six wide in upper stretch, ran on and improved. RELOAD BULLET got away well and had the early lead but was soon pressured by an outside
rival, dueled inside that one but off the fence on the turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened. SEA TO AIR forced the pace from outside going
three wide into the turn, weakened in the stretch. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) shifted in, saved ground, ran evenly. MIGHT BEE SPEEDY dropped back to the
trailing group heading up the backstretch, was encouraged a bit four to five wide on the turn, failed to menace. SUPER HEADLINE was ridden along early
racing mostly four wide, failed to rally. SERENADE AT SEA was outside foes five wide on the turn at the back and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
TRIZZEL TRAZZEL broke a step slow on the start, settled patiently into stride on the fence having one beaten down the backside, began to pick up runners
smartly slipping through on the fence at the three furlong marker, shifted out four wide gaining momentum at the top of the lane and closed in to the wire to
get up in deep stretch for the well timed stretch rally. VERY SAVVY ran inside stalking in the third flight down the backstretch, was urged on the fence
midturn, closer the gap on the leader running on the rail in upper stretch, loomed in the two path between rivals at the top of the lane and tenaciously battled
to the wire just missing the win in a solid effort down the stretch. SWIRLING DANCER comfortably dictated terms down the backstretch, continued up front
with only mild pressure being applied around the turn, began to shorten stride holding onto the lead narrowly at the eighth pole and faded in deep stretch
while not switching leads to the wire to settle for third money. MUSKOKA SUMMER was content to track the frontrunner down the backside, chased the
pacesetter on the turn, took closer order to the leader by the quarter pole, could not find another gear in upper stretch and faded with runners on each side
at the furlong pole. ALBERTA BE MINE settled in the third flight stalking on the outside, kept pace with others when roused at the three furlong marker and
ran on mildly inside horses down the stretch to the wire. ABSOLUTE JEWEL trailed the field down the backside, continued to see the pack around the oval,
swung outside catching up to rivals six wide turning for home and passed weary foes in the stretch. CHROME'S ANGEL was off a bit slow on the break,
stalked three deep outside horses down the back straight, made a brief run three wide at the three eighths marker until the quarter pole and stalled by
mid-stretch. STOLE THE RING stalked near the back between horses in the early going, offered little run through the turn and nothing to give in the run to
the finish line.

Footnotes
COMPUTER HACKER had a narrow lead with challengers on each side down the backstretch, opened up sharply while in hand around the turn, had a
convincing lead at the top of the stretch, was getting leg weary late but safely held for the front end score in the end. SCAT FACTOR watched on the rail,
the front three engage for the lead down the backstretch, was stuck on the fence in behind a fading rival midturn, shifted off the weakening foe at the quarter
pole, angled outside reaching for ground in the four path straightening out for the drive and closed in strongly to the wire but could not reel in the winner. BE
ON NOTICE tracked the front threesome between horses down the backside, rallied two wide outside foes at the quarter pole, could not threaten top two
finishers in mid-stretch but gamely ran to the wire for a clear third in the end. TRUE SHOT settled on the inside in midfield at the half, closed the gap three
wide outside horses at the quarter pole and showed good late energy in the stretch to just get up at the wire for a minor placing. VISITOR'S WELCOME
prompted the pace three wide outside down the back straight, chased the frontrunning winner on the turn, battled for the place share in upper stretch but
faded on the fence losing a few positions in the last furlong. HIGHLAND ROCKY stalked outside near the back in the early stages, could not find more to
play a factor running through the turn but rallied smartly to finish up with interest passing horses to the wire. HAAHEE tracked the front trio on the outside
three wide down the backstretch, was roused on the turn keeping pace with others, began to weaken in the four path turning for home home and gave way
in mid-stretch. EAT FOOD EVERYDAY was void of speed trailing down the backside, caught up to the field three wide outside horses at the quarter pole
and passed tiring runners down the lane. NEEDS FULFILLED was checked between horses soon after the start, shuffled back to stalk near the rear down
the backside and could not get into contention running down the stretch to the wire. HURRICANE DESHAMBO was unhurried having one rival behind him
down the backside, made no progress saving ground around the bend and could be no menace between foes in the stretch drive. SWEET SUPER SPEEDY
travelled on the outside in mid-pack down the back straight, could not match strides with rivals throughout the turn and could not be a presence in the drive
to the wire. DELIRIO was hustled inside to press the pace on the rail down the backstretch, came under a ride but was losing touch to the leaders at the
three furlong marker and backed away on the fence in upper stretch.
