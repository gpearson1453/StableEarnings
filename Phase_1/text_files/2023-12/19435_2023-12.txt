early speed, raced outside around the turn, made a wide bid and got up for second. SAMMY DANSEUR JR. raced near the back in the beginning, made a
late rail bid and was a clear third at the wire. PRIZELESS pressed the early pace, racing behind the two leaders, made a bid at the 3/8 pole and hung down
the lane. BERTIE'S GALAXY dueled for the early advantage, drifted in around the turn and faded down the stretch. GRUNT vied for the early lead, saved
ground around the turn, steadied, getting in tight quarters and was done. THE JOCKEY OF #4 GRUNT LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #6
BERTIE'S GALAXY FOR INTERFERENCE AROUND THE TURN. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #6 FROM 5TH AND PLACED

FLEETRIDGE vied for the early lead, dueled throughout, brushed down the home stretch and just held on for the win. GET THEM JUSTIN raced within
contention, moved up, three wide around the final teurn, dueled down the stretch, brushed with FLEETRIDGE and just missed the win. RUNTODAY
challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the top two late, but held off GUITAR SLIM for the third position. GUITAR
SLIM raced within striking distance, made a late try and missed for show. WARRIOR'S RUN void of early speed and was never close. BURNING LEAVES
lacked early speed and showed little. THE JOCKEY OF #5 GET THEM JUSTIN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #2 FLEETRIDGE FOR
INTERFERENCE DOWN THE HOME STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

TWO MINUTE DRILL went to the front, drove clear, led throughout, pulled away and proved much the best. ANOTHER HOT MESS pressed the pace,
forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the winner. MARINA'S GOLD raced in the middle of the field, gained ground late and was a clear third.
DASHYNS DREAM raced in the middle of the field, came around the second turn on the outside and finished evenly. TENSAS CANDY broke out, raced
evenly near the back and was never a factor. KELA'S TURN pressed the early pace and faded. AKIANE'S SOLDIER hopped at the start and was never a
threat. TINCANDANCE void of early speed and was outrun.
