encouragement and got up the final strides. The latter exchanged contact with Taptap leaving the gate then pressured the pace, raced close at the rail on
the turn, dueled through the stretch and took second the final strides. CREME DE LA QUEEN set a pressured pace inside, rounded the turn at the rail and
dug in leaving the eighth pole, but was nipped in the final strides. RUMORGOINGAROUND gave chase, rounded the turn in the four path and ran evenly in
the lane. JUNIPER GRACE veered in and made contact with Pretty Castle leaving the gate then gave chase, raced in the six path on the turn and passed
rivals outside. BABY BREEZE chased, raced in the three path on the turn and showed little in the lane. PRETTY CASTLE was bumped leaving the gate
then gave chase to no avail. EVEN SMARTER steadied at the break then gave chase and rounded the turn about the four path. MIREYA chased inside,
steadied at the rail approaching the five sixteenths pole then weakened on the turn. Per Stewards Ruling #3, Taptap is disqualified from earnings.
