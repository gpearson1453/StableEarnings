Footnotes
GUNNER GABRIEL stalked three wide, pressed the top pair from the four path around the turn, bid nearing the lane, dueled with an inner ROMANIAN
PRINCE through the lane while being bumped multiple times and floated outwardly by that one, yet prevailed. ROMANIAN PRINCE bumped with an inner
rival at the start before brushing with an outer foe in the aftermath, bumped his inner counterpart once more shortly after before being hustled forward
between horses, prompted the leader along with an outer rival into the turn, bid turning for home, dueled with his outer counterpart in upper stretch but
leaned out and bumped that one multiple times in the final furlong and got bested. ONE STEP ASIDE broke a step slow, trailed in the three to five path and
moved up. ATLAS FALLS broke a step slow, saved ground well back and improved inside of foes. A VAN ON THE RUN brushed with an inner rival at the
start and failed to factor from the three path. AFFAIR TO REMEMBER chased along the inside, shifted out entering the lane and faded. NOAH MY BABY
bumped with an outer rival twice at the start, set the pace in the two path, showed the way from outer pressers into the turn but weakened with a quarter
mile to go.

Footnotes
FIRSTHAND JUSTICE stalked four to three wide while urging along outside of rivals into the turn, progressed to bid turning for home, drifted to the five path
entering the lane and drove clear. KARAMEL CORN laid off of the pace in the four path, shifted out to the six path in midstretch and rallied for place. TIDE
RISING tracked along the inside, came under urging into the turn, was green to advance inside of rivals through a rail seam at the furlong grounds, yet did
so and edged show. JACK BE FAST dueled two wide, then between horses tipping to the three path entering the lane, but was bested by his outer
counterpart before yielding between horses late. RED HOT POWER chased in the three path, but gave way between horses around the turn, yet kept on
mildly. OL' L B broke a step slow, rushed forward to duel for the lead inside of a rival, but chased an outer pair into the lane and weakened between horses
in the final furlong. JOES A ROCKIN was outrun and pulled up in the stretch.

maintained a wide margin under a drive. NATURE OFTHE BEAST bumped with an outer rival at the start, chased in the two path and ran on to gain place

DOMI broke a step slow and failed to threaten from the five path. MINDSHIP Q lacked speed along the inside and failed to factor. MAS ORO vied for the
lead inside of the eventual winner into the turn, but weakened with three furlongs to go. CANTRUNWITHBIGDOGS bumped an inner rival at the start, raced

Footnotes
CROSSED UP prompted outside of the leader and from the three path, dueled with that one through the lane, wrestled an advantage late and held from an
outer bidder. HIGH FIRE trailed in the five path, rallied to attempt a late bid outside of the new leader approaching the wire, but ran out of ground. DIVA
POWER set the pace inside the two path as the eventual winner applied outside pressure, dueled with that one through midstretch but gave in late. NO
TWOWAYSABOUTIT stalked in the four path and only managed to chase through the lane. TWERK tracked in the four to three path and failed to menace.
APPEALING SENORITA saved ground off of the pace and faded.

Footnotes
ACCURATE tracked in the two path, sustained a grinding charge to bid inside of the leader in the final furlong, forged an advantage as that one drifted out
entering the final sixteenth, then shifted outwardly and edged clear. MUCHO PRIMO vied in the three path, led around the turn, drifted outwardly entering
the final furlong, straightened before drifting again entering the final sixteenth allowing for an inner rival to gain an advantage, then got bested and herded by
that one in the closing stages. THE MAN CAN vied along the inside, chased the leader around the turn, then kept on well. BUCKEYE RUCKUS pursued
from midpack in the five path and chased willingly. TIZ A RUSH was away awkwardly and last of all, trailed in the four path, floated out to the seven path
entering the lane and moved up. PLATE IT UP laid off of the pace in the three path, shfited out tot he six path nearing the lane and failed to factor. BLUE
MONARCH lacked speed along the inside and was outrun. JUST CHESTER pressed in the four path, chased in upper stretch and weakened through the
final furlong.

Footnotes
SICILIAN STYLE TWO stalked three wide, was roused into the turn to bid along with an outer foe turning for home, dueled between horses through
midstretch and narrowly prevailed. WANDA SUSIE DOOZY tracked forwardly two wide and between horses, split foes to bid inside of the leader at the
furlong grounds, dueled through the late stages but just missed. CATCHAFALLNSTAR was antsy in the starting gate, then broke slowly, trailed in the two to
three path, swung out to the seven path entering the lane, rallied with a late kick in hopes of reeling in the top pair, but ran out of ground. SHE HAD A
SECRET laid off of the pace in the five path and chased willingly. MY DANCING QUEEN tracked in the four path, bid turning for home, vied through
midstretch but yielded entering the final sixteenth. SILVER CANDICE was a bit restless in the starting gate, set the pace along the inside, was headed by a
pair of bidders nearing the lane, then kept on before weakening leaving the sixteenth pole. THEODOROPOULOS chased along the inside and weakened.

through midstretch, inched clear at the sixteenth pole and held from an outer bidder. SHE'S CRAFTY trailed in the four path, advanced in the five path
around the far turn, then sustained a rally to gain place in the final sixteenth but was too late to reel in the leader. LIBERTY BELLE set the pace in the three
path before tucking to the inside entering the backstretch, vied with an outer pair of bidders around the far turn, but gave way with a sixteenth to go. LOST
BIKINI took simultaneous bumps from rivals on both sides soon after the start, tracked in the three path, bid three wide into the far turn, vied turning for
home, but yielded leaving the furlong grounds. LIAM'S LASS pursued from midpack in the four to three path, chased around the far turn and failed to
menace. JEN'S BATTLE lacked speed in the five to four path and faded. QUARANTINA bumped an outer rival in the opening stages, pursued from midpack

Footnotes
ITSABLINGTHING vied in the three path and between horses into the turn, led from an outer pair while drifting to the four path nearing the lane and drove
clear. TRICKED OUT broke a step slow, tracked in the three path, took aim inside of the clearing leader in upper stretch and chased that one home to prove
second best. FAITHFUL STEPS was bumped and steadied back at the start, trailed along the inside and moved up. SISTER CODE tracked from midpack in
the five path, bid outside of the top pair while floating to the six path turning for home and gave way. LOVE MY CANDY prompted from the four path, vied
between horses getting floated to the five path turning for home and weakened. LINDSY'S SHADOW failed to factor from the four path. SKI SLOPE bumped
an outer rival at the start, set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals while a path off of the rail into the turn, but weakened turning for home and stopped.
