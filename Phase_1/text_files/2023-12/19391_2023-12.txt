FROSTY PAWS bumped at the start, shifted three wide after a quarter, closed willingly through the turn and upper stretch to make the lead before the
furlong marker and drew clear under mild urging. WILDERZAR was forced out, bumped at the start, trailed down the backstretch, rallied determinedly in the
four path through the stretch and finished clear for second. TWELVE MINUS ONE drifted out at the start, saved ground through the turn, shifted out four
wide at the top of the stretch and improved position late. FATHER OF LIES pressed the pace three then two wide into the stretch and weakened late.
MOBOT failed to menace. LOUIS bumped at the start, made the lead soon thereafter, set the pace along the inside into the stretch, altered course to the
three path near the furlong marker then weakened.

ALWAYS LAUGHING never far back, responded with a rapid moved three wide entering the stretch, made the lead near the three sixteenths pole then
widened the balance of the trip under left handed urging to win as much the best. CANDY ISLAND set the pace two wide through the clubhouse turn, gave
up a narrow lead, prompted the balance of the pace and gamely gained second. DUNVEGAN DOLL allowed to settle, closed gap four wide through the
stretch. LIBERTY BELLE pressed the pace along the inside through the first turn, gained a narrow lead, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was
outfinished. CHIQUITA MOSCA unhurried into the stretch, gained ground in the three path through mid stretch then lacked racing room late and leveled off.
HAPPY BEE had good early speed three wide and weakened on the second turn. BOURBON BUNS was through after a half.

the balance of the pace and drew off under brisk handling. FINISTERE bore in at the start, was unhurried early, closed determinedly four wide through the
stretch and finished well clear for second. SHORTLY pressed the pace along the inside into the stretch then faded. DARK BARON set a pressured pace two
wide into the turn, had speed into the stretch then weakened. C C'S CLEAR CREEK was bumped hard at the start then no threat. GREAT REVELATION
had good early speed two wide then faded. WILEY T bumped hard at the start and was outrun. RANSAM PAYNTER was in tight along the rail near the five
