Footnotes
WILD IRISH tracked from inside to turn, rallied into stretch dueled to go clear late. CRYSTAL SNOW rushed between horses to the front, dueled stretch,
outgamed in the late going. KAYA'S HALO bore out start, chased to the quarter pole, weakened for show. CAROLINA SUN raced along evenly with no late
kick when needed in the stretch. FAIR FOLLY close up outside to turn with nothing left from that point. IN COLOR pinched back at the start, off rail run to
turn, gave in readily. JENNIFER MY LOVE always trailed throughout.

NOBLE GENTLEMAN good position never far back to far turn, rallied along, cleared. CLOUDY HOLIDAY lagged back to far turn with a run late for place no
match. MENDELSFLY perfect position to far turn, bid into stretch, settled for show. FAVORITE HAUNT never far back to the stretch leveled off in the late
going. MASTERY N POLISHED no speed to the half, kept on to improve mildly late going. GOOD POINT antsy in the gate, threw head at the start, raced
back with no speed to far turn, moved up in the stretch run to improve. MASTER OF THE NITE no speed to the half, improved position far turn, flattened
out. PAPA'S RANSOM close up to the half with nothing left. IN THE NUMBERS failed to menace. MASTER SWITCH close up to the half with little
thereafter. TORMENTA JERRY good speed to the half with nothing left and dropped back readily
