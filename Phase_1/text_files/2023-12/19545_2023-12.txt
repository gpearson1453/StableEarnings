SEA ART dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and drew off in the stretch. THE SWEATY FOX bumped with the horse to
his outside at the start, recovered to duel up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and could not go with the winner late but
chased that rival home from there. AFTER A FEW raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the bend in the
four and five path and improved position in the stretch. FABULOUS CANDY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the early going, saved
ground around the bend and kept on to the wire. ZIP CODE ENVY raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn
from the three path and was outkicked in the lane. MISTY GALE bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and never threatened. DIVISIBILITY chased the leaders through the opening stages, continued around
the turn in the three path and faded in the stretch. MOON ROSE trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SASSY CHARLEE stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and
kicked clear. ATHENA'S WISDOM chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the bend in the three path and
kept on to the wire. RITABOOK tracked the pace setter up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and chased on in the stretch.
PRACTICALITY bumped with the horse to her outside at the break, settled in the middle of the pack on the rail early, came around the turn in the four path
and improved position mildly in the lane. IMMORTALLOVE led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and weakened in the
final furlong. BAND SWEETHEART bumped with the horses to her inside at the start, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn
from the two path and weakened in the lane. ONE TOUGH DAME raced off the pace on the inside through the opening stages, continued around the turn in
the three path and made no bid. DEL REY DOLLY bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside early, navigated
the bend from the two path and was empty in the stretch. JUST MERCY trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY DIVA tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the turn and kicked clear in the
stretch. MANAGING MISCHIEF led the way on the inside early, dueled from the two path headed into the turn and could not go with the winner in the final
furlong but kept on to the wire. FLUFFY pressed the pace between horses through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the four path and chased
the winner home in the lane. U LITE UP MY LIFE bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader from the rail up the
backstretch, continued around the bend in the four path and kept on to the finish. AUTUMN EVENING raced in the middle of the pack between horses up
the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and finished evenly. DANNEEL raced off the pace on the outside through the opening stages, came around
the turn in the five path and gained ground mildly in the stretch. FLEUR DELACOUR pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the
two path around the turn and weakened in the lane. UNO UNO bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, raced at the back of the pack on the rail
early, navigated the bend from the three path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. HOPESNDREAMS was fractious in the gate, broke well and raced in
the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the turn and faded from there. PRINCESS GLADYS was
pinched back leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the bend in the four
path and showed no kick. LADY LYLA veered in leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and was never a factor.
SOUTHERN COTTON raced off the pace on the inside early, came around the turn in the two path and was empty in the stretch.
