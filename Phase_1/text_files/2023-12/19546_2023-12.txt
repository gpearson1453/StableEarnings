COLOR CRUSH saved ground to far turn with no room into the stretch, troubled tice and split horses late to get up in time under good handling. BUOY
unhurried to far turn, blocked in the upper stretch with an outside run late while probably best and holding the place spot. KICK OUT THE JAMS bit tardy

Footnotes
RATE CONFIRMATION no speed to the turn, rallied around the field with good energy and cleared away to the wire. IRON MAN JIMMY dueled from two
path to the stretch, stayed on for place spot. BATTLE BORN inside to quarter pole, angled wide into stretch gained show spot. BUEHLER'S DAY OFF loped
up to the quarter pole with a bid, faltered in the drive. LYTE CRUDE well placed between horses to the turn with a bid, weakened late. HILTON HEAD quick
with good position to the turn, came up empty in stretch. OFF THE CUFF inside run to the lead, dueled to quarter pole while empty in stretch. MINING
CAMP inside run to quarter pole, swiped into the stretch, faded back. ACE THE RACE never factored throughout. MONTY'SWORTHYCAJUN dropped back
rapidly. After a trainers objection into the upper stretch run there was no change and the official sign was posted..
