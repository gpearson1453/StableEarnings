Footnotes
UN OJO tracked the early pace between rivals, then rated kindly on the turn and made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, kicked clear off the turn, then
held on well late to prove best under crop urginfg. BOURBON CHASE was settled early on the inside, moved off the inside on the turn, made a five wide
move by the quarter pole, then drifted out slightly by the sixteenth marker and was gaining late but could not get to the winner. COLLOQUY was well rated
along the inside, cut the corner off the turn to be in contention but needed more late, bested rest. LOBSTA set the early pace on the inside, then was in the
two path on the turn, headed nearing the quarter pole and weakened. CALLALOO chased the early pace from the outside, dropped down to be three wide
on the turn and had no rally. ZEEBEAR prompted the pace two to three wide and then was empty.

BOLD JOURNEY chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take
command just inside the eighth pole, edged clear to the finish. ROTKNEE broke out at the start under hustling and bumped GREELEY AND BEN, raced
forwardly placed along the inside and established the front near the nine-sixteenths, showed the way through swift splits coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, shook away and took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, kept on to repel a
pair and preserve the place honors by a nostril. DURANTE coaxed from the gate, led early on before settling just off the inside in closest aim of ROTKNEE,
went three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was
outfinished in the late stages while staying one paced to the end. STAGE LEFT chased inside briefly before tipping three wide five furlongs from home,
tucked to the two path through the turn and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
GREELEY AND BEN got bumped at the start by ROTKNEE, who broke outwards, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under
coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
STRANGE FRUIT vied for the early lead on the inside, shook clear on the turn and came two wide off the turn and was clear by the furlong marker, then dug
in late to hold sway under a drive. MISS FASHIONISTA was settled early, dropped to the inside entering the turn and advanced by the quarter pole, cut the
corner off the turn and angled out by the three sixteenths for aim on the front runner and finished well but could not get to that rival while being clearly
second best. FIRST CLASS CAT vied for the early lead outside the winner, then was three wide on the turn while still up near the pace but faded in the drive
while keeping on to clearly best the rest. PUREST PERFORMANCE tracked the early pace and was three wide on the turn but lacked a late response,
saved last spot in the superfecta. FOLLOW THE FED chased the early pace from the outside, four to five wide on the turn and weakened. BELLA ISOLA
stumbled at the start, settled between rivals early, then was two to three wide on the turn and was not a threat. SASSY TALLAHASSEE was settled early on
the inside and had no response.

Footnotes
LEADING CONTENDER was well rated early two to three wide, shifted out and made a four wide move on the far turn, latched on to SUERTE nearing the
quarter pole, then gained a short advantage by the furlong marker and drew clear under left handed crop urging to prove best. SUERTE vied for the early
lead between rivals on the first turn, then shook clear by the five eighths marker, remained clear until headed by the winner nearing the quarter pole, dug in
gamely before not being able to match strides in the final sixteenth with the winner while being clearly second best. OVERSTEP was settled early towards
the inside, shifted out to the three path on the backstretch, then advanced five wide on the far turn and offered no late rally while besting the rest.
AMERICAN LAW vied for the lead on the inside and saved ground throughout but weakened. HOLD THE SALSA was five wide into the first turn, pressed
the pace on the outside early, then tracked the pace and was four wide on the far turn and tired. NAPA VALLEY was four wide into the first turn, pressed the
pace in between rivals and three wide on the first turn, then chased the pace three wide on the far turn and tired.
