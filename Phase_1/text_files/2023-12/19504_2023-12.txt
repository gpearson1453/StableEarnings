GRAPHIC DETAIL bore out start, good position to turn, angled out and drove clear. SHEFFLIN chased pace to the turn, kept on in the stretch, best of rest.
INSOLITO sprinted clear outside to the front, stayed on stretch for show. DOUBLE CLUTCH bore in start, exchanged bumps, raced along evenly with no
kick. COYOTE ROAD never factored throughout. MENDEL'S SECRET bumped from the gate with no speed and never a threat. MEADOW VALUE good
position with a chase to turn, gave in though the stretch. STITZY squeezed back from the gate, steadied back with no chance thereafter.

Footnotes
OUTADORE bumped at the start, quickly to the front while well handled throughout to just prevail at the wire under stout handling. NIGHT TIME chased
winner throughout, stayed on game with a late lunge missed. SURLY FURIOUS unhurried to the turn, rallied along in the stretch for show spot. LET MY
PEOPLE GO good position never far back outside to quarter pole, evenly late. LONG LANCE tardy from the gate with a mild run from the turn, evenly late.
OCEANIC awkward start with no speed to the turn, improved position late. LATIGO antsy in the gate, raced close up to turn with no late response.
VOODOO ZIP unhurried throughout with nothing left from the turn. KOOLHAUS through early, gave way readily. ZOOMBIE was rowdy loading, tried to keep
up to the turn but dropped back in the stretch.
