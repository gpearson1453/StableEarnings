Footnotes
PLAYERA raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late
to kick clear. CHESS NOT CHECKERS tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the turn, was
clear in upper stretch and caught in the final furlong, chasing the winner home from there. STRIKING CHROME stalked the leader between horses through
the opening stages, came around the bend in the four path and kept on to the wire. PURE ELEGANCE hit the gate leaving it, raced off the pace on the
outside early, navigated the turn from the four path and improved position in the stretch. DRILL'S VALENTINE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside
up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and showed no kick. MISS MAC MAC veered out at the start, recovered to lead the way up the
backstretch, dueled from the rail around the second turn and tired in the lane. PERFORMANCEANXIETY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside
through the opening quarter, came around the turn in the two path and faded in the stretch. GRAND ARROW chased the leader on the inside up the
backstretch, continued around the bend in the three path, gave way approaching the quarter pole and was empty from there.

came around the turn in the three path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and dueled gamely to the wire to just get the win. MIDNIGHT GETAWAY
stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the turn and dueled gamely to the finish, narrowly missing.

in upper stretch and chased those rivals home. JACKSON STRONG bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, raced off the pace early, saved
ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and improved position late. SLIM MAN veered out and bumped hard with the horses to
his outside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack on the rail for the run up the backstretch, began a mild bid from the two path coming around the
bend and finished evenly. SHASTREE bumped lightly with the horse to his inside at the start, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the turn
in the three path and never threatened. LEOPARDI tracked the leader on the outside through the early going, navigated the bend from the three path and
weakened in the lane. O ROMEO bumped mildly with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader on the outside up the

WITH FEELING (GB) raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far bend in the
three path, was pushed out in upper stretch when SISTER SERENDIPITY drifted out, dueled from there, veered in and bumped with that rival again near
the eighth pole and then held that slight margin to the wire. SHAMU raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run
up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground late. SISTER SERENDIPITY saved ground
around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path, drifted out in upper stretch, was bumped
by WITH FEELING near the eighth pole and was caught in the final strides. ALTHENA bumped with the horses on her outside at the break, raced in the two
path early, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and gained ground late. SUMMER
FLOWER raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged headed into the far turn, was bumped by LOVEYS
EMBRACE when that rival lost his rider near the half mile pole, angled in to save ground around the far turn, dueled in upper stretch and was caught near
the wire. ESTRELLA KIARA hopped up leaving the gate and was away from the gate slowly, raced in the four path at the back of the pack through the
opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the three path and gained ground mildly in the lane but never threatened. DISCREETS PRINCESS raced
in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and
improved position mildly in the stretch while never truly threatening. TINS bumped with the horses to her inside at the start, saved ground early, continued
up the backstretch off the pace, continued to save ground around the second bend and made no bid. MOBINAH bumped with horses to both sides at the
start, raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the two path and was empty in the lane.
LOVEYS EMBRACE saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, swerved awkwardly approaching the half mile pole, lost her rider
and later walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRIES WAS MADE INTO THE HALF MILE POLE INCIDENT AND CONCERNING THE BUMPING AT THE EIGHTH
POLE. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
