stretch, led into the final furlong but was overtaken while clear for the place. TAP YOUR HEART went to the front then showed clear early, was challenged
on the outside near the five-eighths pole, vied along the rail on the turn, was roused in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage in upper

ZAPRUDER went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside at the rear, rallied to make a bid in the five then four path on the far turn, took the lead
near the quarter-pole, battled outside of the runner-up to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. SOUTH STREET was hustled from the gate,
went four wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the three path while asked on the far turn, passed the five-sixteenths between
foes, turned into upper stretch under a drive, drifted out under a left-handed crop near the furlong marker, fought on gamely inside of the winner to the finish
and just missed. DADS GOOD RUNNER was fractious in the gate, went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way on the inside of
a rival, vied along the rail on the far turn, lost the lead before the quarter-pole, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but just held the
show. UNCLE WATER FLOW went five wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace, went four then five wide while asked on the far turn, came six wide into
the stretch and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. MAMA BANNED ME went two to three wide on the turns and failed to respond. BOLD
LOOKER saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused while inside on the far turn and came up empty.

MORNING MATCHA broke a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the
lead near the furlong marker then drew clear under steady handling. BUSTIN BAY was forwardly placed on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn,
made a bid into upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place. LISA'S VISION was
well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole and came up empty while best of the rest. LITTLE LINZEE raced
just off the pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path while between foes, was asked near the quarter-pole and also
came up empty. EASY PLAY showed the way with a clear advantage, rounded the turn in the two path, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and gave
way. VALLELUJAH moved out while urged along, dropped back three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
TODAY'S FLAVOR showed the way down the backstretch narrowly five paths off the inside, had BE THE BOSS advance outside and yielded the front half
a mile from home to that rival tucking to the rail into the turn, got given a notch to work with midway on the turn and tipped out two then three wide at the
five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch under urging, took back command nearing the eighth pole and edged clear to the finish. GENERAL
BANKER got steadied at the start when placed in tight between foes and conceded three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased four to five
wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, went eight wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. BE THE BOSS six
paths off the inside down the backstretch, advanced to take over command half a mile from home and tucked once clear to the two path through the turn,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared nearing the eighth pole, weakened
in the late stages while safe for the show honors. CALLALOO broke out a step at the start under coaxing, chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and kept on to the wire. NIAGARA SKYLINE stumbled at the start conceding three lengths to the front before
settling into stride, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went eight to
nine wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. BARESE got bumped at the start by NIAGARA SKYLINE and in turn bumped JEMOGRAPHY, chased
five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired. JEMOGRAPHY got bumped at the start by the
aforementioned foe, raced forwardly placed three wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch
and tired. LOBSTA coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
PRETTY UP was last to commence, moved up then chased the pace on the outside, made a bid in the four path on the turn, dueled outside of the runner-up
in the stretch and gamely prevailed. NEEDED moved in while showing speed then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, took a
short lead near the five-sixteenths, dueled inside of the winner in the stretch and just missed. MIA NIPOTINA was urged along off the pace, moved from the
rail to the two path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. LOVE LIKE CRAZY bumped with a rival at the start, was
urged along off the pace, moved from the four path to the two path on the turn and lacked the needed response. NECESSARYANDPROPER angled in
while going to the front, showed the way under some pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead near the five-sixteenths and tired.
BELLS TOLLING was fractious in the gate, brushed with a rival after the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and was
no factor. CHANGE ORDER was hustled from the gate, chased the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, moved from the two path to the four path
on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch and had nothing left. SIX O THREE was urged along well back in the field, went four wide on the turn, came six
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MYSARIA was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to
respond. GOING FOR GLORY was urged along near the middle of the field, traveled four wide on the turn and also failed to respond. CARA'S GIRL
bumped with a foe at the start, saved ground on the turn and never reached contention. TSUKIMI was restless in the gate, raced on the outside under
urging, went five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was outrun.
