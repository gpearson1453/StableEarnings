Footnotes
BIGOFROMFRESNO set the pace from inside under pressure, maintained a short lead through the far turn, shook free at the top of the lane, put to right
urging shortly after and held safely. MOOGIE SON settled inside, tipped out leaving the far turn, put in mild late bid but could not reach the winner. BARELY
FUNTIONAL unhurried in the beginning and trailed in the two path, raced along the inside into the far turn, tipped two wide leaving the bend, angled to the
rail midstretch and summoned a mild rally to gain the show honors. TOM AND JAZZY prompted the pace from outside, remained alongside the leader to the
top of the lane, failed to kick on with the winner in upper stretch and flattened to fourth. LUKA GRAZIE tucked inside racing towards the rear, saved ground
to the stretch and lacked the needed response. BILLY'S BET stalked along the rail, tipped out into the lane and failed to produce a bid.
NOLONGERAHOBBY reserved in the early stages and moved into the two path, eased further off the rail on the second bend, came four wide into the
stretch and could not rally. BRAVESTONE traveled in mid-pack outside a rival, rounded the far turn three deep and weakened. FORE FLAG stalked three
deep around the clubhouse turn, came under a ride in the two path on the second bend, got crowded between rivals leaving the far turn and weakened in
the drive.

Footnotes
COLORADO CRUISER chased briefly from inside then steered out and went up to take control and duel with URBAN LEGEND, lost touch with that rival at
the quarter pole, chased two wide into the lane, came back in the final sixteenth and won the bob on the line. URBAN LEGEND sprinted clear then dueled
inside COLORADO CRUISER, kicked clear of that rival with a quarter mile left to run, remained clear into deep stretch under right handed urging but grew a
bit weary late and got caught at the wire. TESSUTO came away slow to begin, moved into range outside rivals, took aim three wide leaving the bend, could
not summon the needed late kick in deep stretch but managed to save the show. NEW KING chased two to three wide on the turn, kept on through the lane
and missed the show. MALIBU ROCKS trailed early then chased in range from inside, lost ground while under a ride on the turn, kept on in the furlong
grounds and whittle the gap late. MONGOLIAN CHAMP broke a step slow, raced widest up the backstretch and trailed into the turn, remained wide into the
lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
EASTER (FR) broke a bit slow, keen early chasing outside a rival, rounded the far turn three wide, moved out in upper stretch, closed in and fought three
deep entering the final sixteenth and drew clear approaching the wire. MISSED THE CUT settled in the two path, saved ground through the far tur while
inching closer, tipped out in upper stretch, fought between rivals in deep stretch and got outkicked by the winner. TIO MAGICO raced up close in the two
path, applied pressure in the middle stages, headed EASTERN OCEAN on the far turn, put that rival away in upper stretch, confronted by a pair of rivals in
deep stretch and got outkicked. WAR AT SEA rated along the fence, coaxed along while shifting to the two path on the far turn, moved out at the top of the
lane and finished evenly late. EASTERN OCEAN took control early from inside, set a pressured pace up the backstretch, raced on even terms on the
second bend, yielded in upper stretch and weakened. ASTRONAUT stalked two then three wide early, spun four wide into the stretch and weakened.

ANISETTE (GB) settled along the inside in range of the pacesetter, continued to save ground on the far turn, tipped out into the stretch, drew alongside BE
YOUR BEST (IRE) at the eighth pole, took over approaching the sixteenth pole and drove clear. BE YOUR BEST (IRE) stepped to the front and dictated the
pace in the early going, met the challenge from MUSICAL MISCHIEF with three furlongs left to run, put that rival away past the five-sixteenths pole,
confronted by ANISETTE (GB) at the eighth pole, lost command shortly after and stayed on to secure the place. MUSICAL MISCHIEF closest in pursuit of
the leader from the two path early on, put in a mild bid at the three-eighths pole, could not sustain the challenge past the five-sixteenths marker, chased two
wide into the lane and kept on to hold the show. SAKURA FLAVOR (IRE) settled outside a rival, continued two wide on the far turn, moved out in the lane
but could not summon a rally. ELOUNDA QUEEN (IRE) was content to trail a bit off the rail, gained along the rail through the far turn, cut the corner into the
lane but flattened out in the furlong grounds.

NEWGRANGE brushed leaving the gate, raced up close in the three path, applied pressure from outside in the middle stages, gained the advantage leaving
the far turn, cleared BRICKYARD RIDE in upper stretch and inched away under a drive. MIXTO chased four wide around the clubhouse turn, rounded the
second bend three deep and rallied for the place honors. BRICKYARD RIDE showed the way early in the two path, took pressure from NEWGRANGE on
the backstretch, maintained a short lead along the fence the relinquished the advantage late on the far turn, could not match strides with the winner in upper
stretch and lost second. SUBSANADOR (ARG) broke in to make contact with NEWGRANGE at the start, tracked in the two path then between rivals,
remained between foes through the far turn and failed to find the needed response when called upon in the stretch. STILLETO BOY gave chase from inside,
coaxed along on the far turn then asked right handed past the quarter pole and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
BEEF WINSLOW traveled in mid-pack early on, moved to the rail for the turn, angled four wide approaching the dirt, surged to the front in upper stretch and
won going away. BOOK SMART sped clear early to establish the front, moved over to the rail for the turn, showed the way along the inside then got
pressured nearing the dirt, came out at the top of the stretch and was overtaken by BEEF WINSLOW, churned on through the final furlong and bested the
rest. KING APOLLO broke a step slow, chased between rivals then three wide into the lane, offered a mild response when called upon and gained the
show. CATALINA EDDY was closest in pursuit off the rail into the turn, chased two wide then drew alongside the leader approaching the dirt, got floated out
by BOOK SMART at the top of the lane and flattened in to fourth in the furlong grounds. LIVING LIFE broke a step slow from inside and dropped back early,
went four wide into the turn, moved into the three path, came out crossing surfaces and improved position in the stretch run. NEON LIGHTS (IRE) forwardly
placed early, chased along the rail through the turn, came off the rail a bid on the turn and weakened. MINISTER SHANE traveled off the pace two wide into
the turn then moved over to the rail, tipped out in the lane and lacked a rally. HAWKER raced in mid-pack outside a rival, got floated five wide across the dirt
and also failed to rally. DR. SOULFIRE traveled outside a pair of rivals off the pace into the turn, spun four wide into the lane and lacked a response when
needed. MANITOWISH settled near the back and moved inside, came out crossing surfaces and was not a factor.

SPEED BOAT BEACH vied inside a pair of rivals then dueled with HEJAZI up the backstretch, held a short lead over that rival through the turn along the
rail, cleared under right handed encouragement in upper stretch and was kept to task to the wire. HEJAZI vied three deep then dueled from outside, fought
with SPEED BOAT BEACH through the turn, lost touch with that rival in upper stretch but remained close through the final furlong proving second best.
GIANT MISCHIEF coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside then inside a pair of rivals on the turn, moved off the fence in the lane and bested the rest.
DAMON'S MOUND stalked three deep into and around the bend, driven three wide into the lane and weakened. RAISE CAIN chased at the back four wide
into the turn, moved inward and trailed two wide leaving the bend and failed to menace. FORT BRAGG had to steady when running up on heels early,
navigated the turn three then four wide and could not produce a bid. SHARP AZA TACK showed early speed speed between rivals but could not keep pace
with the top pair up the backstretch, chased between rivals through the turn and faded in the lane.

DADDYSRUBY set the pace inside rivals then cleared up the backstretch, showed the way along the rail through the turn, remained clear under a drive into
deep stretch, collared by BIG POND late and won the bob at the wire. BIG POND broke well and was forwardly placed early between rivals, went three wide
into the turn, loomed two wide entering the stretch, drew alongside DADDYSRUBY in the final fifty yards and got outnodded for the victory. CLEARLY
UNHINGED chased wide early outside a rival then angled to the two path for the turn, steered out to the four path at the quarter pole and gained the show.
ROYAL SPA got brushed from outside leaving the gate, traveled near the back in the early going, navigated the turn two wide, moved to the inside in the
stretch and earned a minor award. FAST AND SHINY chased four deep up the backstretch, remained outside rivals on the turn then spun three wide into
the lane, asked left then right handed in the drive and weakened. ICE DANCING broke in and brushed ROYAL SPA, began to climb up the backstretch,
chased three wide into the turn, five wide into the lane and could not rally. SATIN DOLL raced wide at the back to the turn, rounded the bend four then five
wide and could not make an impact. HOWL pressed from outside early then was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, lost ground two wide around the bend
and tired in the lane. BANGS chased off the rail then angled to the rail for the turn, dropped back around the bend and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
VISUALLY sped clear and moved inside, coaxed along into the stretch, roused at the eighth pole and held safely under hand urging. SEA DANCER was
closest in pursuit from the two path, inched closer on the far turn, took aim two wide into the stretch, finished determinedly down the lane but could not reach
the winner while clearly second best. IMA JOKER tracked in the two path, spun four wide into the lane and gained the show. BLUE FASHION came away
slow, tucked inside racing at the back, saved ground to the stretch, tipped off the fence and came with a mild rally but missed the show honors. GERWIG
raced keenly chasing two wide then along the inside, ridden along on the far turn but lacked the needed response in the stretch run.
AMERICANDREAMMAKER unprepared at the start and came away poorly, tracked two wide then outside a rival, tipped 3wide on the far turn, moved out
but lacked room between rivals at the top of the lane, cut back inside and kept on to improve position. TIANMA chased four then three wide early, remained
off the rail to the stretch and weakened. FLIGHT TO QUALITY (FR) reserved early and steered to the rail, driven two wide into the lane, moved out at the
top of the stretch and lacked a rally. AURATIUM pulled along the inside into and around the first turn and had to steady off heels, saved ground through the
second bend, asked in the lane but lacked room at the sixteenth pole and was not persevered with late. SPEED SHOPPER hustled from the gate and
chased along the inside into the clubhouse turn, got put in tight and had to check around that bend, went two wide into the far turn, angled out and came five
wide into the lane and lacked a rally. AFFAIR got forced wide entering the first turn, chased outside rivals then four deep into the second bend, eased further
out and entered the stretch seven wide but failed to menace. RESPECT THE CROWN settled two wide outside a rival then had to alter out from behind a
rival into the first turn, tracked three deep into the second bend, angled six wide into the lane and came up empty.
