place money. RUNTODAY went to the front to a pressured lead from the inside down the backstretch then vied for the lead around the final turn and tired.
CODETOWIN tracked the leaders from off the rail around the first turn then steadily advanced from three wide to the top of the stretch, tipped out to four
wide for a mild gain but bled and was vanned off. WISE ANCHOR raced off the pace on the inside to the three furlong marker and faded. GOTTA GO trailed

Footnotes
AMERICAN TSUNAMI co-led from three wide to the three furlong marker then edged away but was headed at the top of the stretch and matched strides
with READY FOR THUNDER on the outside and AFRAID IM NOTCENTS on the inside down the stretch and won the nod. AFRAID IM NOTCENTS vied for
the lead from the inside bumped with CONVALIDATION entering the turn and had to check slightly but made a rebid and matched strides with AMEARICAN
TSUNAMI and READY FOR THUNDER but lost the photo. READY FOR THUNDER raced just off the pace to the turn then made a four wide bid at the
quarter pole to engage the leader at the top of the stretch and took a narrow lead and fought gamely to deep stretch but was outfinished. JAYDYN CAT
chased the leaders from close off the pace but lacked room on the turn and made a rebid into the stretch, angled out to four wide at the sixteenths pole but
was no match for the top three. CONVALIDATION pressed the pace from the two path to the five sixteenths pole bumped AFRAID IM NOCENTS on the
turn and tired. SHE'S EXTRA co-led from four wide to the three furlong marker and retreated. JOCKEY OBJECTION WAS POSTED, THE JOCKEY OF
AFRAID IM NOTCENTS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST AMERICAN TSUNAMI FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN, AFTER A STEWARDS
REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AND THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED.

STRONG PROSPECT was allowed to settle down the backstretch then made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker to circled the field and made a
late rally to draw clear late. COOL RIDE hustled to be off the pace down the backstretch then moved up to engage the leader at the quarter pole and took
the lead at the top of the stretch but tired late. HANGIN' TUFF stalked the pace down the backstretch made a mild gain from three wide on the final turn but
flattened out and held the show. NOT LIKELY raced near the back while saving ground around the first turn then made a rail bid down the backstretch,
moved out to three wide around the final turn and tipped out to four wide in upper stretch for a late run to improve position. PATEK raced in the middle of the
pack while saving ground around the first turn, moved out to four wide down the backstretch but lacked a rally. GLAMORDINI rushed up to a clear lead
down the backstretch then was headed at the quarter pole and gave way. MAGNOLIA SPEED tracked the leader from the inside but failed to menace.
SPIRITUAL MIRAGE was off slow and remained back. POUND OUT A DEAL was forwardly placed from the two path to the three furlong marker and
weakened. JUDE'S LIL ROUGE went five wide into the first turn settled in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then dropped back but was never a
threat.

DRIED PEPPER stalked the pace from the inside, slipped through at the top of the stretch and engaged the leader in deep stretch for a late duel and won
the nod. LOUIS LE GRANDE raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then steadily advanced on the backstretch from four wide, engaged the
leader in deep stretch for a late duel but was outnodded by inside rival. FEROCITY rushed to a pressured lead to the top of the stretch then edged away but
was collared late and lost the photo. HUNTER QUICK pressed the pace from the two path to the three sixteenths then fought gamely but was no match for
the top trio. THRILL RIDE raced off the pace from between horses to the half mile marker then fell back and passed tiring rival in the stretch. ANDIAMO
GIACOMO raced off the pace from the three path to the quarter pole then tipped out to four wide in upper stretch but lacked the late response. TARGET
PRACTICE raced near the back and was not a threat. D TWO hopped at the start, spotted the field several lengths and remained back.

SHARP CHARLIE shared the command to the turn then edged away and drew off in the stretch. SON CARLOS was forwardly placed on the backstretch
then made a three wide bid on the turn but was no match for the winner. HEARTTHROB HALO showed no early speed then moved up from three wide on
the turn for the late run and was just up for the show. LION HEART LEGEND shared the command to the turn then chased the leader to deep stretch and
gave way grudgingly. RISKTAKER chased the leaders from the inside but failed to menace. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU tracked the leaders from between
horses through the turn but was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
WHORL GIRL sprinted to a clear lead, floated out in upper stretch but was kept to task to hold on for the win. GEMMY pressed the pace through the turn
then made a three wide bid on the leader but couldn't catch but proved second best. HIDDEN LOVE raced off the pace on the inside, slipped through into
the stretch for the late run and missed the place. AMELIES DREAMER rushed up to vie for the lead to the five sixteenths pole and weakened but was best
of the rest. TENSAS CLEAR broke outward and bumped KATIE BUG'S LEGACY then chased the leaders early, moved between horses into the turn and
passed tiring rivals. LA LOLA pressed the early pace from the two path and faded. OUR BOSS LADY hesitated leaving the gate and spotted the field
several lengths, then was hustled along to improve position. JANIS was always back. HOLIDAY FLOWERS stalked the pace from four wide to the turn then
dropped back. KATIE BUG'S LEGACY was bumped by TENSAS CLEAR and pinched back after leaving the gate but showed little.
