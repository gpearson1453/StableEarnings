Footnotes
PAYOFF CYCLE set a pressured pace inside of a vying rival around the first turn, built a clear margin down the backstretch, then drew off under a drive.
JIMMIE'S HALO settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted out and advanced in the four path approaching the far turn, stalked around that bend before
claiming place from an inner counterpart entering the lane, then fended off an outer bidder late. LONE STAR MAX was slow early and lagged well behind,
cut the gap in the two path around the far turn, picked up stride shifting to the five path in upper stretch, stayed on to bid for place in the final furlong but was
kept at bay. GYPSY'S SOULMATE dropped his rider stepping onto the track, pursued from midpack in the four path, gained place approaching the far turn,
chased along with an outer rival while taking that bend in the three path, then weakened. MY LIL DUDE tracked along the inside, chased around the far turn
and faded. STONE ALLIANCE stalked three to two wide, then between horses down the backstretch and faded. ROCK STAR ALEX laid off of the pace in
the four to five path and failed to factor on his left lead. MAIN DUDE sternly pressed the leader around the first turn, chased that one down the backstretch,
but began to weaken with a half mile to go and was eased through the lane.

MOESAHANDFUL set the pace inside of a pair of pressers early on, opened up down the backstretch and widened under moderate handling. JOHNNNY'S
GAME chased in the four path and ran on to edge place. FOE tracked along the inside, claimed place from an inner rival turning for home, but was bested
by an outer bidder. DATS TRUE LOVE was last away, settled off of the pace in the three path and stayed on. BOLIVER failed to menace. MEET GEORGE
JETSON played no factor. ROCKALL was reluctant to load, pressed between horses early on and weakened. MALIBU MONEY made little impact.
LARRY'S LUNCHBOX vied three wide around the first turn, then stopped. SAVAGE KISS lost her rider down the backstretch. A STEWARD'S INQUIRY

Footnotes
STOVALL tracked two wide and between horses, steadied slightly among foes entering the turn, took aim outside of the top pair in upper stretch, sustained
grinding progress to bid in the final sixteenth and edged past. CARPIS set the pace two wide, then inside of a pressing foe while taking the turn in the two
path, dug in to resist that foe's challenge nearing the lane, clung to an advantage before shaking free entering the final sixteenth, but was caught by a wider
bidder approaching the wire. TDZSHININLUCKYSTAR tracked along the inside, shifted out turning for home, tipped four wide in upper stretch, stayed on to
gain show in the final sixteenth and narrowly held from an outer bidder. TAKE CHARGE J J settled off of the pace in the four to five path, then offered a late
kick to miss reaching show. STRONG PROMISE stalked three wide, pressed the leader from the three path around the turn, bid turning for home, vied
through midstretch, but was turned away entering the final sixteenth and yielded between horses. CAJUN CYCLONE vied along the inside early on, but
chased into the turn then weakened. DEACON JONES laid off of the pace in the two path and failed to factor.

Footnotes
PASS ON NOTHING bumped with an inner rival at the start, vied for the lead with outer foes while taking the turn in the two path, inched away to a clear
margin in upper stretch and held sway. GORDITO HERMOSO saved ground off of the pace, tipped to the three path entering the lane, rallied between
horses, edged place from an outer rival nearing the final sixteenth and chased the leader home. BOBBY TWO SHOT'S tracked two wide and between
horses, smoothly tipped to take aim in the four path entering the lane, but failed to change leads and only managed to chase the clearing leader into
midstretch, then lost place to an inner bidder in the final furlong. SONOFASHIP stalked in the four path and between horses into the turn, got floated to the
seven path entering the lane, yet ran on willingly. MIDNIGHT HALO tracked along the inside, took aim inside of the leader in upper stretch but lacked a bid.
STARRY EYED vied for the lead in the three path, drifted to the six path entering the lane, then steadily yielded between horses while hanging on his left
lead. JAYDE'S BANDIT saved ground well back and improved to no avail. MATZOH BALL bumped with an outer rival at the start, settled off of the pace in
the three path, steadied into the turn and failed to threaten. ALVARADO CAT chased in the five path and between horses, backed out entering the turn and
gave way. ELLS tracked in the six to five path while advancing into the turn, floated to the eight path entering the lane and faded. TOP PRIORITY lacked
speed in the four path, shfited out nearing midstretch and made little impact. ARIES HONOR showed little.

Footnotes
ERVADEAN stalked the embattled leading pair from the three path, bid outside of them entering the lane, drew clear in upper stretch and held sway.
COEXIST laid off of the pace in the three path, swung out to the seven path entering upper stretch and rallied to gain place passing the furlong grounds.
THE GREAT MAYBE tracked from midpack in the three to four path before tipping to the five path in upper stretch, stayed on to bid for place along with an
outer foe at the furlong grounds, but got outkicked. LITTLE BLAZE took contact from his outer rival at the five furlong pole before dueling inside of that one
into the turn, battled around the bend, but proved no match for an outer bidder in upper stretch and gave way. UNRIVALED QUEEN brushed an inner foe at
the five furlong pole, sparred for the lead with that one into and around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer bidder passing the quarter pole and faded.
TRAVAILLE chased from off of the pace in the four path and made little impact. BELGIAN BLUE broke a step slow and showed litlte.

Footnotes
PINK POLKADOTS set a clear pace, widened in upper stretch and held sway safely. MS QUALITY CONTROL settled off of the pace along the inside,
swung to the five path entering the lane, rallied to gain place in the final furlong and held from an inner bidder. TARNEEMA bumped the outer part of the
gate while breaking slowly, trailed along the inside, advanced in the four path around the far turn, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, rallied with a
belated kick in the final furlong, shifted in and needed more for show. JAM'S PAPER MOON leaned in at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside,
sustained a rail chase to vie for place passing the furlong grounds, but flattened out. STAR ANISE was put to a bit of tight quarters between horses leaving
the gates, rated well back along the inside and ran on up the fence. MONTCLAIR ROAD broke inwardly, pursued from midpack two to three wide, got
floated to the six path entering the lane and kept on mildly. JUST A COED stalked along the inside, chased entering the lane, then tired between horses
passing the furlong grounds. HAUNTRESS lacked speed in the three to four path and failed to menace. WASHASHORE stalked two wide but weakened in
upper stretch. SILVERHEELS made little impact from the three path. SWEET MISS MAGGIE tracked two wide but faded between horses around the far
turn. LUMINOUS RULER chased along the inside, but faltered entering the far turn and was through early.

Footnotes
WILLTORUN trailed early on, picked up stride fanning from the four to six path into upper stretch, then rallied with a late kick to reel in the clear leader at the
wire. SAINT SELBY sped clear, showed the way in the two path, opened up nearing the lane, but tired while flopping back to his left lead entering the final
sixteenth and got nailed by an outer bidder at the wire. BOSS' DIALIN IN tracked from midpack in the three to four path, ranged up to bid for place in upper
stretch, gained that position at the furlong grounds but was outkicked by an outer bidder in the late stages. INVULNERABLE stalked along the inside, took
the turn in the two path, then chased through the lane and lacked a bid. DOUBLE EDGE SWORD bumped an inner rival leaving the gates, chased forwardly
in the three path, then between horses in upper stretch and lacked a bid. COMISKEY PARK laid off of the pace in the three to four path and failed to
menace. SWING SHIFT was bumped by an outer rival at the start, raced forwardly two wide and between horses, but faded around the turn. HAPPY
DANCER saved ground off of the pace and failed to factor.

Footnotes
PURSUIT OF LIBERTY leaned out and brushed the gate then a rival at the start, settled off of the pace in the two to three path, shifted out to the five to six
path entering the lane, produced a good kick to bid outside of the leader at the furlong grounds and drove clear. REAGAN'S FLAME set the pace along the
inside, vied with an outer bidder around the far turn, shook free off of the rail leaving the three sixteenths pole, but was bested by an outer bidder with a
sixteenth to go. MODERN SOUND rated well off of the pace along the inside, gained in hand two wide and among foes turning for home, then sustained his
rally between horses to gain show at the sixteenth pole. LIVI ME DREAMING leaned in at the start, outside of the leader while tugging under snug restraint
in the three path around the first turn, vied in the two path around the far turn, drifted out to the four path in upper stretch and yielded between horses. L. A.
WOMAN transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, then bumped with her outer counterpart soon after, laid off of the pace in the two
to three path, then moved up between horses. LOVE TO EAT tracked along the inside, chased through midstretch and tired late. JOCASTA bumped an
outer rival at the start, drifted out into the first turn before settling into stalking stride in the four path, chased in the three path around the far turn, then faded
between horses in upper stretch. SCOOP tracked two wide and between horses, advanced to stalk the top pair from the two path nearing the far turn, but
tipped outside of them leaving the quarter pole and tired. MIXER was bumped by an inner rival at the start, then bumped with that one again getting knocked
off stride in the early stages, saved ground well back, encountered traffic in the four to two path turning for home, was blocked behind foes in the four path
entering midstretch, then moved up between horses in the final furlong, but took a bad step leaving the sixteenth pole, faltered and was vanned off.
MARQUETTE WARRIOR saved ground off of the pace to no avail. SMART WITH HEART veered outwardly at the start, raced at the rear while hard to
handle around the first turn, floated to the six path around the far turn and was outrun. PAGEANT PURRFECT was off a step slow and steadied when put to
crowded quarters between horses at the start, bore wide into the first turn before recovering to pursue from midpack in the five path, but faded around the
far turn.

Footnotes
GUITAR SOLO dueled with an outer rival and edged clear in the final furlong. FREEBURN exchanged multiple bumps with an inner rival early on, dueled
two wide, but failed to maintain even terms in the final furlong, yielded and lasted for place. PLATINUM MINIT traded contact with an outer rival multiple
times early on, settled off of the pace in the two path, swung out to the six path in midstretch and offered a belated kick to reach show and miss place.
CLEARLY A TEST chased in the three to four path, stayed on to gain show at the furlong grounds but was nailed by an outer rival at the wire. TOMMIE G
stalked outside of the top pair then tired through the lane. CUSTOM SUNSHINE tracked in the two path and faded. DIAMOND DEAL lacked speed in the
three to four path before floating to the seven path entering upper stretch, and was outrun.
