Footnotes
COLONEL BARTON in mid pack early while four side into the turn, moved closest to the leader turning for home, lugged in behind that rival past the furlong
marker, dropped to the rail and finished with good courage to be up. STATE SCHOOL SMART broke sharp, showed the way up the backstretch just off the
inside, shook well clear through the bend, continued to hold a daylight advantage past the furlong marker, allowed the winner the inside soon after and gave
ground grudgingly to that foe, remained clear for the place. SINGING GROOM unhurried in the early going toward the rail, shifted out early turn, swung four
wide into the lane, rallied for the show, not a threat to the top two. SIR PEEL main body off the inside, three wide through the turn, went evenly the lane
through the lane, outkicked for the show. PREPAREDNESS void of speed, three wide out of the turn, picked off some tiring rivals to improve position.
MOTOWN COLLECTION last away, made little impact toward the rail. EIGHT STRAIGHT chased early inside, retreated steadily along the inside.
SCRIMSHIRE in the second flight between horses, gave way in the drive.

speed off the inside, remained the two through the turn, improved a bit to the wire with some mild late interest. KAVA void of speed, in some traffic through
the turn, mild late interest. TWO BELLS lugged in to be last away, raced far back, steered four wide when beginning to advance exiting the turn, improved in

Footnotes
STAGE LEFT bothered at the start, advanced late in the turn when four wide, bid, took over, clear a sixteenth out, held the runner up safe late. PAYNE well
back off the early, asked along late in the turn, improved rail, long drive for the place, determined. FRIAR LAURENCE bobbled at the break, swung out to be
five wide for the drive, advanced to reach a striking position a furlong out, flattened out a bit late to be outkicked for the second spot. SKY AND SAND
behind the leader, in some traffic and a bit tight entering the stretch, went evenly the final furlong. COLD AS HELL dueled early closest to the inside,
continued to vie through the turn, lugged out when straightened for home then gave way soon after. AWESOME AARON forwardly placed off the rail, three
wide and in tight turning for home also faltered when the real running began. ELI'S PROMISE broke out but alertly, set or forced the pace for a half, tiring
when bothered upper stretch, stopped through the stretch.

Footnotes
TEXAS TOWN cleared to the inside the opening furlong, showed the way into the turn along the inside, increased advantage into the lane, enough left late
to contain the runner up. CRUSHED IT off the pace out in the strip, moved closer three late in the turn, lugged in when chasing the winner past the furlong
bid, lodged a late bid outside than one, not enough in the final strides. CHUN MONEY forwardly placed, chased past the furlong marker, lacked a closing
punch for the top two, narrowly gained the nod for the show. AK SAR BEN DERBY off slowly, continued to lag in the back for a half, fanned six wide into the
lane when commencing to rally, continued willingly to the finish to narrowly miss the show while well out in the strip. TELL 'EM I'M COMIN bothered at the
break, back and inside, improved position without posing a serious threat. SHATTUCK lacked speed, moved closer five wide by late in the turn, failed to
continue that advance through the stretch. MELT WITH YOU off a step slow, also improved the second quarter, no real threat. NULLIFY remained back,
four wide turning for home, failed to menace. MAJOR MACK broke in, bothered foe, mid pack, tired. WORLD FAIR chased the pace for a half, gave way.
JUST ASK WATTS in mid pack early, faded. ASK WILLIE forwardly placed early, stopped.

Footnotes
DEMI prompted the pace from the outside, ranged up three wide to challenge turning for home, put a head in front when straightened for home, drove slowly
clear. LITTLE SISTER SUE off the early pace in hand toward the inside, moved out in the two path turning into the lane, roused, finished with good
determination for gaine the place. FASHION RAGE in the second flight while racing off the inside, three to four wide into the lane, closest to the winner a
furlong out, had little for that one late, outkicked for the place. HONEY RUN lacked speed, moved out, came four wide for the drive, displayed some mild
late interest while not a serious threat. MY FRIEND AMY void of speed for a half, improved with some belated interest through traffic. YOU LITTLE VIXEN
forced the issue up the backstretch off the inside, challenged a briefly put a head in front between horses late in the turn, weakened in the drive. ABBY THE
BULL DAWG void of speed, four wide into the turn, remained back in failing to threaten. SHANGHAI EXPRESS in mid pack for a half off rail, backed up
through the stretch. SPLENDA GAIL broke out but alertly, showed the way for a half then stopped when headed late in the turn.

Footnotes
MARGOINABUBBLEBATH with the pace between foes, put a head in front into the stretch, drifted out a bit a furlong out, enough held to hold the runner up
safe late. ALWAYS ANGELS back off the pace and the inside, three wide through the turn, dropped inside as the winner drifted out with a furlong to run,
slowly getting to that one late. BACKYARD MONEY narrowly set the pace along the inside, continued to vie through the turn inside the winner, two path for
the lane, weakened, nod for the show. WILDWOOD BYE one paced behind the leader, two path into the lane, late bid for show, missed, no threat to the top
two. TYRONA broke back, lacked a serious response toward the inside. BENNYKAYANDSUZYTOO forwardly paced for a half, had little left for the drive.
ALSANAH off step slow, remained always back. SAINT SARENA forwardly placed early, was finished before a half.

Footnotes
VALENTINE CANDY away in good order, pressed in the four path up the backstretch, three wide bid through the turn, kicked strongly clear under steady
handling the final furlong. WILLY D'S in mid pack outside, four wide through the turn, lugged in a bit upper stretch, rallied willingly for the pace in determined
fashion late, no match for the winner. ANDY'S CANDY void of early foot, three wide through much of the turn, came four wide for the drive, solid rally too
late. MARKET STREET in the second fight toward the inside, asked through the turn, not enough late for the pace while between foes for the place.
MOLLY'S TOWN broke in good order, relinquished the advantage, went after that foe into the turn, took over, held a narrow advantage late in the bend,
headed by the winner and began to fade. GENERAL SHIPMAN within striking distance three wide, four wide into the lane, lacked a closing response.
FROST FREE broke back, was hustled up the rail to show the way early, headed into the turn, weakened. CEEPEEGEE in mid pack early, shuffled back in
traffic with just over a half remaining. BYE BYE LIAM in mid pack, tired. DREWMANIA saved ground to no avail. SWEET SODDY J was finished early,
trailed in.

Footnotes
IN GOOD TASTE close from the start while between foes through the first turn, took over into the far turn, dueled through upper stretch then was fully
extended to prevail. HONOR CAT in the second flight while racing outside, four wide far turn, bid into the lane, dueled through upper stretch, outkicked late
to prove clearly second best. AMY Z broke alertly, narrowly set the pace while in the two path, vied into the far turn, weakened to prove no match for the top
two, prevailed for the show. EXTREMELY GRUNTLED five wide into the first turn, raced four wide into the lane when beginning a mild advance, flattened
out in the drive to finish up evenly. LITE IT UP LOUIE bothered at the start, recovered to race in midpack, three wide when moving into the lane, also went
evenly through the in lacking a late kick. FANTASTICAL broke out, bothered LITE UP LOUIE, moved up to race forwardly early, began to tire after a half.
CATALYST off a step slow, raced back while saving ground most of the way, lacked a rally. SCENIC BEAUTY raced always back. TAYLORS MAGIC was
finished after a half. ART QUEEN pressed through the first turn, lodged a brief bid before a half, began to weaken soon after. HER BEST FRIEND was
never involved.
