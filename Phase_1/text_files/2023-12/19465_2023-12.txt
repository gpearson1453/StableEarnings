Footnotes
SWELTER had speed from the start three wide, dropped back a bit after a half, closed willingly three wide through upper stretch to make the lead near the
furlong marker then drew off under an energetic hand ride to win as much the best. HOUSED prompted the early pace two wide, dueled through the far turn,
gained the advantage at the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner while well clear for second. ONEMORANDTHECHECK set a pressured
pace inside rivals into the far turn, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then faded. GIZMO'S MISSION bobbled inward at the start, was in tight a few
strides after the break, checked repeatedly behind the top pair through the clubhouse turn while boxed in, split horses three wide nearing the far turn, surged
to the lead at the three furlong marker, battled through the far turn then was used up. SEEING RED was no factor. THE EQUINEST settled five wide and
had brief speed. PAPA CHARLES trailed.

Footnotes
PRIVATE LAKE settled with the second flight two wide, rallied three wide under strong handling through deep stretch and got up in the final strides. LUCKY
JUNIOR sped to the lead three wide leaving the clubhouse turn, dueled down the backstretch, gained command entering the far turn, set the balance of the
pace and just missed hanging on. GILES was bumped at the start, allowed to settle then finished determinedly four wide. YOUVESAIDITALL broke outward
bumping GILES at the start, trailed into the far turn then found his best stride late in the two path. JACK'S ADVANTAGE vied for the lead for six furlongs
then weakened. STRIKE A BEAT set the pace along the inside into the first turn, gave up a narrow advantage before a quarter, battled with the runner up
down the backstretch, kept pressure on that one into the stretch and weakened late. GEH SCHNELL was outrun. TRIVISTA was no factor.

NAPA DUDE trailed for four and one half furlongs, circled his field five wide on the turn and six wide through upper stretch, made the lead near the furlong
marker and drew clear under left handed urging. DESERT HIGHWAY allowed to settle, loomed boldly two wide into the stretch and finished second best.
MR. CELLULAR chased the pace three wide into the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. PRIVATE CONNIE pressed the pace two wide into the
stretch and was outfinished inside rivals. NATURE OFTHE BEAST never far back, lacked racing room while five wide in upper stretch, shifted into the three
path then finished evenly. DOMI was in tight at the start then no factor. FIRE KING away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the stretch then
weakened. KALINBA close up along the rail, was through after a half.

Footnotes
CHANEL SPIRIT made the lead shortly after the break, set all the pace and widened through the stretch under mild right handed urging to win as much the
best. BODIL had good early speed inside rivals, offered a mild bid into the stretch and finished clear for second. SPICE ICE slow early, found her best stride
late along the rail. KAT TRAX unhurried early, swung wide and had a mild late rally outside rivals. GOODNESS SAKES failed to menace. KISS VALENTINA
chased the winner three wide into the stretch and weakened late. SWEET OUTLOOK pressed the pace along the inside into the turn then weakened.
KERRI'S MIRACLE close up early, was through after a half.

Footnotes
YOGA QUEEN broke in full stride to set all the pace, drifted out to the six path entering the stretch, was put to right handed urging, the rider switched to left
handed urging inside the furlong marker, continued to drifted out to the eight path through the final stages and prevailed under strong handling. FOR THE
BISCUIT with the second flight three wide, drew closer to the winner midway on the turn, was carried out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, matched
strides the length of the stretch while carried out to the nine path and just missed. MITESSE allowed to settle, had a mild late rally two wide. JOLIE RULER
had speed from the start, loomed boldly two wide on the turn then was outfinished. PRINCESS HALIME pressured the winner along the rail down the
backstretch, dropped back on the turn then finished evenly. MISS OVER THERE well placed, failed to respond. SKY was no factor. DIVINE MARTHA
trailed.
