Footnotes
ROBUST bobbled at the start, moved up and pressed the pace, drifted in down the home stretch, dueled to the wire and was just up. EL JEFE COBB raced
within contention, came around the turn three wide, made a late bid, racing four wide and finished willingly. SUNSET WAR vied for the early lead, saved
ground around the turn, was bumped down the stretch, dueled to the wire and was outfinished by the top two. FRIEND'S DO CARE showed early speed,
saved ground around the turn and weakened down the lane. MARKETBOOK lacked early speed and was never a factor. MORO FLASHBACK raced evenly
in the back and showed little. THE JOCKEY OF #5 SUNSET WAR LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #2 ROBUST FOR INTERFERENCE DOWN
THE HOME STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #2 FROM 1ST AND PLACED HIM 3RD.

Footnotes
ELI'S GIRL stalked the leader in the early going, moved up around the final turn, drove clear and finished well. MISS DARLENE had a tight start, racing in
the middle of the field, made a late gain, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. MAGNA COLORS lacked early speed, raced outside
around the final turn, showed late interest and got up for third. WA WA WEE WA went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and tired down the home
stretch. ROSIE'S ANGUS broke in, raced within contention, faded and was no threat late. VALLEJO void of early speed, drifted out around the first turn and
was never close. BOSTON PAULETTE lacked early speed, trailed the field and was outrun.

REAL DEAL RYAN raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a bid, racing four wide and proved the best. MY LUCKY
BREAK vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for the win. SHEZAPERFECTDREAM shut off start, racing in the
back, made a steady gain and finished willingly. CANKTON'S COWGIRL raced within contention, saved ground around the turn, finished evenly and lacked
a kick. C C SENORA broke in , raced in the back, came around the turn wide, improved position, but was no factor. SHEZA HOT STORM raced in the front
end in the beginning, saved ground around the turn and faded. MAXIMUM MOXIE raced evenly near the middle of the field and was never a factor.
ALBANIAN PRINCESS bumped at the start, raced near the back and was never a threat. MIDNIGHT CIGARETTE pressed at the pace and made a steady
retreat.

speed, racing in the back, came around the final turn on the outside, entered the home stretch six wide and closed well. SENSE OF FLURRY raced within
contention, was close throughout and ran a game third. SARA'S SAPPHIRE pressed the pace, raced close throughout and hung on the inside down the
lane. APRETTYLULABY raced within contention, weakened, finished evenly, lacking a late kick. BEYOND D'ORO void of early speed and passed tired
ones. SASSY EMMA pressed the early pace and faded. BARRANCA vied for the early lead, dropped back and was no threat late. LOVIN LIVIN always

SECRET VISTA lacked early speed, moved up, racing four wide around the turn, dueled down the lane and proved the best. MONGOLIAN BEE pressed the
pace, raced close throughout, dueled to the wire and was outfinished for the win. MISTER K raced within contention, eased back, made a late wide gain and
closed willingly. SHUT UP MAN was an early factor, forwardly placed throughout, lacked a late kick, while putting forth a game effort. HIS GIANT went to the
front, saved ground and hung late. LAUNCHED raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn and faded. DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE always
raced near the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
WON DAY pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, came around the turn three wide, dueled down the lane and prevailed for the win. BLESSED
ASSURANCE void of early speed, rallied outside around the turn, closed fast down the stretch and needed more ground. FLASHY MEG vied for the early
lead, being challenged by LOVELYREDSTILETTOS, put her away, drove clear and couldn't hold off the top two. KYLE BEAUTY raced evenly near the back
and was never a factor. LOVELYREDSTILETTOS dueled on the front end in the early going and faded. MISS JANA raced within contention, saved ground
around the turn and dropped back. BRAVE CITY GIRL void of early speed and was never a threat.

Footnotes
R T'S IRON MAN bumped at the start, raced near the middle of the field in the beginning, moved up, contention, entered the home stretch five wide, rallied
and got up late. CLEARLY A JET challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for the win. CHIEFS BLANKET vied for the
early advantage, saved ground, was outfinished by the top two, while putting forth a game effort. RED OCTOBER lacked early speed, showed late interest,
while finishing wide and was no factor. HOLIDAY RUN broke in, raced near the middle of the pack, had an outside trip and lacked a rally. DIXIE'S ASTRO
raced within contention, faded and was no threat late. WILDCATS'S MEOW raced in the back of the pack, moved up, but was no factor. COLE'S
SENSATION raced in the middle of the field, weakened and was never a threat. SMOOTH CUSTOM always raced near the back and showed little. UNCLE
CHAN went to the front, saved ground and stopped.
