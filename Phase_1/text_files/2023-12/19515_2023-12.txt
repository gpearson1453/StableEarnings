Footnotes
TOKAMAK bobbled and brushed outer rival leaving the gate, forwardly placed two then three wide on the first turn, bid three deep on the second bend, took
a short lead while dueling with I GOT A GUY through the lane and dug in to prevail. I GOT A GUY sent for the front early then raced up close in the three
path on the clubhouse turn, moved up to apply pressure on the backstretch then raced on even terms, vied with outer rivals late on the far turn, dueled
inside TOKAMAK down the lane and finished gamely in defeat. PRAY FOR ME RAY broke a step slow, chased keenly in the two path under a hold early,
raced between rivals into the second bend, angled out and came five wide into the drive, came with a late run outside the top pair but ran out of time. IVORY
SKY dropped back off the pace and moved into the three path, bid four deep on the far turn, lost touch at the top of the stretch and churned on while unable
to re-rally in the furlong grounds. SURE PROSPECT coaxed from the gate, raced in the two path off the pace early, moved into range in the middle stages,
traveled along the rail then tipped two wide around trouble rival and could not produce a bid in the stretch. NUMBER ONE SON had to check when running
up behind a rival on the first turn then steadied again at the three-quarter pole, moved closer three deep between rivals in the middle stages, lost ground on
the far turn three to four wide and failed to menace. BRING HIM HOME trailed on the inside on the first turn, two wide into the lane and was not a factor.
HILL SIXTEEN sped to the front and moved inside, pressured from outside on the backstretch, lost command on the far turn, roused with three furlongs left
to run, pulled up shortly after, stopped in upper stretch and walked into the van following the race.

JUST IS showed the way three wide into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, challenged RYDER'S CANDY approaching the stretch,
responded to the when called upon and held the runner-up at bay. RYDER'S CANDY stalked two wide into the turn, bid inside JUST IS leaving the bend,
lost touch briefly into the final furlong, kept on willingly in deep stretch but lacked the needed late punch to get by. ROSIE ANN RULES raced up close from
outside, went five wide into the turn, angled down to the three path, came back out into the lane, weakened in the drive but finished a clear third. PLUM
CREEK raced up close between early, four wide into the turn, moved down to the two path then got boxed in at the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide
into the drive and weakened. BLUE CLOUD trailed on the inside and came up empty in the lane.

ESTABLISHED stumbled and got bumped from outside leaving the gate, chased on the inside then two wide into the stretch, rallied steadily and drove past
in the final fifty yards. OIL CAN KNIGHT set the pace under pressure from outer rival, shook free around the turn, showed the way three wide not the
stretch, remained unchallenged into the final furlong but got run down in the final sixteenth. EL DIABLO ROJO got bumped and crowded in the beginning,
stalked from outside, rounded the bend four then five wide and finished willingly for the show. PERFECT D broke in and bumped EL DIABLO ROJO,
pressed the pace from outside, lost touch with the leader at the three-eighths pole, chased four wide into the drive and weakened in the furlong grounds.
GROWTH ENGINE got bumped then crowded early, trailed three then four wide on the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
THUNDERHEART was a bit antsy in the gate, dueled outside COMMANDER KHAI, disposed of that rival approaching the eighth pole and drew away.
CATBERNAY brushed with outer rival early, chased two wide around the bend, moved out in the lane and finished willingly to earn the place honors.
COMMANDER KHAI dueled for the lead from inside into and around the turn, battled to midstretch and weakened. STAFFORD TO KUPP antsy in the gate,
brushed with inner rival and got put in tight early, chased three then four wide on the turn and lacked a bid. TRIBAL IMPACT laid off the pace early on,
rounded the bend three to four wide and failed to threaten. ECHO ALPHA SIX fractious in the gate, trailed on the inside then two wide and was not a factor.
HIGH PRESS chased widest near the back early, navigated the turn four to five wide and failed to menace. CONCH DADDY stumbled badly at the start and
unseated the rider, caught by the outrider following the race and walked off. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START OF CONCH DADDY AND RULED
THAT HE CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS AT THE START AND IS CONSIDERED A STARTER.

Footnotes
WINNING BIG closest in pursuit from inside into the turn, chased two wide into the lane, rallied inside the leader and overtook that rival, then edged LAST
CALL PAUL for the victory. LAST CALL PAUL forwardly placed four deep into the turn, continued four wide into the lane, rallied three deep late and got
outclosed by the winner. SMILING JOJO broke in, sped clear to take control, padded the lead two then three wide on the turn, held a diminished lead
entering the final furlong and yielded to rivals on both sides in deep stretch. TWILIGHT MOON broke slow and bumped leaving the gate, climbed a bit and
dropped back, angled in on the turn, steered back out approaching the stretch and improved position. GRAZEN BOY tracked four wide into the turn, moved
out and entered the lane eight wide and failed to respond to urging. BEAR COAST bumped with outer rival at the start, chased under coaxing two then three
wide and weakened down the lane. UNCLE JUJU bumped with inner rival early, chased three deep into the turn, exited the bend five wide and faded.
PICAHOUSE bumped with outer rival early, chased in the two path then along the rail, ducked out from the left hand in upper stretch and had little left for the
late stages.

SCATIFY hit the gate to lose a step at the start, chased three deep early, bid three deep or four wide on the turn, fought three wide into the lane, took over
past the quarter pole, battled with MARCH OF TIME through the final furlong and held gamely. MARCH OF TIME stalked from inside early, steadied a bit
into the turn, bid inside the leader entering the lane, dueled inside SCATIFY down the stretch and finished gamely in defeat. BATTLE CRUISER broke a
step slow and got crowded at the start, trailed off the inside, angled to the rail for the turn, moved back out in the lane and was along for the show.
BENEFICIAL brushed the gate but was still away alertly, dueled for the lead from inside then cleared up the backstretch, held a short lead two wide into the
lane, relinquished the lead between rivals at the top of the stretch and weakened down the lane. SHARP LORENZO bobbled at the start, chased keenly
between early, rounded the bend in the two path, steered out in the lane and lacked a rally. HONEST COOP dueled for the lead from outside then chased
the leader leaving the backstretch, re-bid between rivals on the turn, failed to sustain the challenge and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
WYNSTOCK hustled to the front from inside and led two wide through the clubhouse turn, showed the way up the backstretch, tested by WINE ME UP at
the five-sixteenths pole, put away that rival at the quarter pole but was immediately confronted by STRONGHOLD from inside, brushed lightly by that rival
midstretch then came in and bumped at the eighth pole while losing command, fought back gamely and bested the runner-up in the final sixteenth.
STRONGHOLD pulled early when rated then chased in the two path, saved ground through the far turn, challenged WYNSTOCK from inside past the
quarter pole, drifted out and brushed that rival lightly midstretch, took a bump from that rival while gaining a slim advantage at the eight pole but was
outkicked in the late stages. COACH PRIME chased three to four wide on the clubhouse turn, navigated the second bend four then five wide, summoned a
mild rally and gained the show honors while closing the gap on the top pair. WINE ME UP forwardly placed four wide through the first turn, chased three
deep leaving the backstretch, bid three wide outside WYNSTOCK at the five-sixteenths pole, fought four wide into the lane, failed to sustain the challenge
with a quarter mile left to run and flattened in the late stages. ACE OF CLUBS raced up close in the three path early, chased between rivals in the two path
into the far turn, entered the lane three wide and weakened in the stretch run. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN
BETWEEN WYNSTOCK AND STRONGHOLD. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT BOTH RIVALS CONTRIBUTED TO THE
INCIDENT AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.
