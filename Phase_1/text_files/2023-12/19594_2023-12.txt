Footnotes
WARRENS WORLD broke alertly, conceded the early lead and took back off of the moderate pace, was well positioned while saving ground heading to the
far turn, roused two wide nearing the quarter marker and took command into upper stretch, was a bit hard to place while leading into the final sixteenth, was
kept to task into deep stretch and held safely in the end to prevail. LOVE OF THE SPORT allowed to settle while never far back, maintained a two wide path
to the second turn, could not reel in the winner in the final furlong but closed well and outfinished the rest to secure second. SHERM unhurried in the early
stages, saved ground along the backstretch run, was coaxed along two wide into the second turn, could not reel in the top pair in the drive and rallied late
for third. EFFECTIVE GIG prominent early, raced three wide into the first turn and was close to the pace into the backstretch run, advanced to prompt the
moderate pace to the half-mile marker, assumed command approaching the quarter pole, was overtaken by WARRENS WORLD into upper stretch, chased
the winner to the furlong grounds, lacked a late response and weakened in deep stretch. UNUSUAL CODE allowed to settle in the early going, was steered
outside of runners into the backstretch and made a middle move approaching the half-mile marker, continued to advance into the far turn and raced within
aim four wide at the quarter pole, lost ground into the stretch and flattened in the late stages. BRANNIGAN stalked the early pace from the outside, gained
ground along the backstretch run, lost position three wide along the second turn, could not keep pace in the drive and gave way. MY DAD IS THIRSTY
contested the early pace then assumed command into the first turn, was engaged by EFFECTIVE GIG into the backstretch run and dictated terms while
prompted to the half-mile marker, was overtaken approaching the quarter pole, dropped back into upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
GOLDEN PRAYER away in good order, assumed command away from the start and dictated terms early on, was well handled through solid fractions
heading to the quarter marker, kept to task into the stretch and kicked clear in the final stages. MISS BELLIMBUSTO tracked the solid pace from the inside,
saved ground while well positioned approaching the quarter pole, mounted an inside bid at mid-stretch, could not match strides with the winner in the final
sixteenth and held for second at the finish. PRINCESA DEL TIGRE forwardly placed early on, raced close to the solid pace and advanced two then three
wide along the turn, was outkicked nearing the furlong marker, offered a mild late bid and just missed for second at the wire. MASTERY KAT tracked the
solid early pace from the outside, chased four wide to the quarter marker, shifted to the inside into upper stretch and lost ground at the furlong pole, re-bid in
deep stretch but needed more late. RAFANELLI off a step slowly to begin, tracked the solid early pace from the rear, gained ground three then four wide
approaching the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and weakened in the final stages.

Footnotes
READY TO GIG prominent early, conceded the early lead and tracked the solid pace from the inside, was well positioned heading into the turn and saved all
of the ground approaching the quarter marker, was asked for run in upper stretch and mounted an inside rally at the furlong marker, battled for the lead into
the final sixteenth and took command into deep stretch, dug in under firm late urging and lasted for the win at the wire. MAGIC WANDERER took back off of
the contentious early pace, was steered outside of runners heading into the turn and chased four then five wide at the quarter pole, loomed while widest into
upper stretch and battled for the lead heading to the furlong marker, held a narrow advantage into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by READY TO GIG in
deep stretch and held well in the final strides for second. HANNAHAZA HETTY forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the solid pace outside of
runners and was well positioned heading into the turn, chased three wide to the quarter marker then vied for the lead into the stretch, battled into the final
sixteenth and was bested by the top pair in a good effort. ROSE OF MOONCOIN close up to the solid early pace, chased two wide to the quarter marker,
came in tight nearing the top of the stretch and shifted to the four path for the drive, was blocked into upper stretch and shifted six wide at the furlong
marker, needed more in the final sixteenth and passed tired rivals in deep stretch. MAGIC CHROME vied for the early lead then was sent to assume
command heading to the half-mile marker, set solid fractions while pressured to the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch, was overtaken at the furlong
marker and gave way in the final stages. SMILINGATTHEMOON close up in the early stages, was asked for run into the turn and pressed the solid pace
two wide to the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. APRICOT BRANDY took back off of the contentious early pace, lost
contact into the turn, chased from the two path into the stretch and did not factor. LITTLE MISCHIEVOUS lacked early speed and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CHIEF WILD EAGLE hopped leaving the break and was off a bit slowly, settled off of the moderate pace, saved ground into the far turn, rallied into upper
stretch, shifted three wide at the furlong marker, vied for the lead nearing the sixteenth-pole, took command into deep stretch and kept to task in the final
strides to prevail. THE CALABRESE KID not far back to begin, was floated out a path entering the first turn and tracked the moderate pace outside of
runners into the backstretch run, was well placed heading to the far turn and gained ground three wide at the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground four wide at
the furlong pole, closed well into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and held safely for second. BUTTONWOOD TREE forwardly
placed in the early running, stalked the moderate pace through the backstretch run, gained ground two wide along the far turn, was roused two wide at the
top of the lane and took command approaching the furlong marker, was overtaken by CHIEF WILD EAGLE nearing the sixteenth-pole, was outfinished by
the top pair in deep stretch and held clearly in the end for third. AZURE STAR (IRE) showed speed away from the start and assumed command in the early
stages, drew to a clear lead into the first turn and dictated terms through moderate fractions into the backstretch, showed the way into the far turn and came
under pressure at the quarter pole, battled into the stretch, lost the lead nearing the furlong marker and gave way in deep stretch. WELLSWORT (IRE)
unhurried in the early running, saved ground into the backstretch, improved position two wide into the far turn, was gaining in the stretch run but failed to
threaten in the late stages. RICH GOLD settled off of the early pace and raced two wide into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, lost
ground into the second turn and chased from the rail into the stretch, gained ground at mid-stretch but finished evenly and did not factor late.

Footnotes
KENNEBEC forwardly placed leaving the break, tracked the decent pace while saving ground into the backstretch run, was well placed heading to the far
turn and made steady headway two wide nearing the quarter pole, brushed twice with MOTHER'S PRAYER into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong
marker, responded to urging and confronted KINGMEISTER approaching the sixteenth-pole, surged in the final strides and got up at the wire to
determinedly prevail. KINGMEISTER showed speed leaving the break and vied for the lead in the early going, assumed command into the first turn and
drew to a clear lead into the backstretch, controlled the pace through decent fractions heading to the half-mile marker, set the pace off of the rail into the far
turn and showed the way to the quarter pole, raced in hand into the stretch and again drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, was kept to task into the
final sixteenth, met the bid of KENNEBEC in deep stretch and was nailed on the wire for the win in a game runner-up effort. LOVE CANDY rated off of the
early pace, came in tight approaching the first turn and steadied off of heels, recovered and saved ground into the backstretch run, improved position at the
half-mile marker and tracked between runners into the second turn, continued his bid three wide at the quarter marker, swung five wide for the stretch drive
and chased to the furlong marker, closed willingly into the final sixteenth, could not catch the top pair in deep stretch and held for third at the finish. HONOS
MAN unhurried in the early stages, raced two wide into the backstretch run and was well positioned heading to the far turn, chased two wide to the quarter
marker then angled four wide into the stretch, improved position at the furlong marker and was gaining in the final sixteenth. TABLE FOR TEN allowed to
settle leaving the break, saved ground into the backstretch run and was unhurried while not far back heading to the half-mile pole, saved all of the ground to
the quarter marker, needed more in the stretch drive and offered a mild late bid. MOTHER'S PRAYER broke alertly and vied for the lead away from the
start, ceded the early lead to KINGMEISTER and tracked that runner through decent fractions into the backstretch run, inched closer heading to the
half-mile pole, continued his gain three wide at the quarter marker, brushed twice with KENNEBEC in upper stretch, chased the leaders to the furlong pole
and weakened in the final stages. HAPPY DOES tracked the early pace from the second flight, was well positioned while outside of runners heading to the
half-mile marker, lost position four wide into the far turn, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the final furlong and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
ACHROMATIC settled in mid-pack through the early going, responded when asked to go after the leaders on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and
finished well under steady handling to prevail. HARBOR'S BEAUTY unhurried early, came under a ride and began to gain ground after passing the three
furlong pole, came six wide into the stretch and continued to run on through the lane but could not reel in the winner. SAHARA SUE was sent hard from the
break until even with HEAVENLY VIOLET then was content to press the pace from just off the flank of that foe to the turn, went to challenge for the lead
passing the five-sixteenths but met some resistance, got the better of the rival passing the three-sixteenths pole, opened up a clear lead down the stretch
then was tagged in the shadow of the wire. DIVINE PASSAGE tracked well behind the pace in the early stages, responded to strong handling passing the
three-furlong pole, went seven wide into the stretch and produced a grinding finish and improved position but came up short of a minor award. LADY OF
THE RIVER broke well and was briefly in the mix for the lead, pulled back from the dueling rivals and then re-bid passing the five-sixteenths pole, was
boxed in early in the stretch run then tried to slip through a narrow opening along the rail but was forced to alter path near the sixteenth pole and lost all
chance. HAMMETT was slow to get going and chased the field to the stretch, came under a ride from the three furlong pole and was making up a lot of
ground in the final furlong. HILLSDALE NATION broke sharply and was forwardly placed early on while racing in the three to four path, dropped off the pace
a bit passing the half-mile marker then rallied into contention through the turn, loomed a threat mid-stretch but could not quicken when needed and finished
evenly. HARBOR DEAREST was a bit slow into stride but was hustled into a position to stalk the dueling leaders to the turn from the rail, was looking to
make a run passing the five-sixteenths pole but had nowhere to go, bided time inside waiting for a hole, tried to switch to the outside but lost momentum and
could not recover. HEAVENLY VIOLET broke well and was hustled to the front, dueled with SAHARA SUE to the stretch, hung in to the furlong grounds and
gave way.

Footnotes
REDSTWIRLINGDANCER broke alertly, ceded the early lead to PRETTY THIRSTY and pressed that runner through decent early fractions, took command
into the stretch, drifted out a bit while clear into the final sixteenth and kept to task in deep stretch to hold sway. THE GREAT HAYNES tracked the decent
early pace from the outside, improved position four wide at the quarter marker, continued to make progress while widest into the stretch, rallied into the final
sixteenth, could not impact the winner in deep stretch but finished well and won the nod for second on the wire. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN tracked the decent
early pace from the second flight, lost position into the turn and chased two wide to the quarter marker, re-rallied into the stretch, closed well into the final
sixteenth and just missed for second at the finish. CANAM GAL tracked the decent early pace from the inside, chased two wide to the quarter marker then
shifted to the three path into upper stretch, advanced and came within aim at the furlong marker, needed more in the final sixteenth and was outkicked in
deep stretch. MATCHLESS allowed to settle away from the start, was unhurried into the turn and trailed three wide at the quarter marker, swung to the four
path into upper stretch, was not able to impact the leaders in the late stages and found her best stride late. SUPER CARO chased the decent pace from the
inside, tipped two wide for the drive and gained ground at mid-stretch, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and flattened out in deep stretch.
BLACK ZABAT tracked the decent early pace while outside of runners, gave chase three wide approaching the quarter pole, dropped back into the stretch
and tired. PRETTY THIRSTY sent leaving the start and assumed command in the early going, set a pressured pace while carving decent fractions to the
quarter pole, was overtaken into upper stretch, chased the leaders to the furlong marker and faded in the late stages.

Footnotes
RAMATHORN broke best, was joined by SIX HOT GRANDS and dueled that foe through the turn while under some restraint, easily disposed of that rival
passing the quarter pole, opened up in the stretch, fended off a couple of challengers despite racing on the wrong lead and won clear under steady
handling. SINGING N DANZING was hustled from the gate then taken in hand to track the pace duel, waited for room inside through the turn, tipped three
wide into the stretch and finished willingly to gain second while no match for the winner. THICKEY BOY came away well, was prominent early on, launched
a bid two to three wide into the stretch, chased the eventual winner the length of the stretch and was outfinished near the wire for the place. PERFECT
SEASON was pinched after the break and fell behind early, was still far behind through the turn but navigated a clever trip in the two path into the stretch,
was gaining ground up the rail when forced to alter course in the final yards and was still advancing at the wire. MENDONSA broke slowly then race
mid-pack to the turn, improved position with a wide middle move from the five-sixteenths marker, went four wide into the stretch and continued to run on with
some interest down the middle of the track. WELL IMAGINE THAT lacked any early speed, tracked near the rear of the field in the four or five path,
suddenly veered in near the seven-sixteenth pole and bumped LIFESBEENGOODTOME, saved ground through the turn and finished evenly.
LIFESBEENGOODTOME broke well but struggled to keep up with the early pace, got bumped by WELL IMAGINE THAT near the seven-sixteenths pole,
steadied hard, lost momentum, dropped well off the pace then managed a mild rally to pass a few stragglers in the stretch. SIX HOT GRANDS was hustled
to the front, dueled under pressure with RAMATHORN to the outside, gave way before the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. KIKIS LOVE OF LIFE
broke well then raced three deep with the quartet tracking the dueling leaders, came under pressure leaving the five-sixteenths pole and flattened out in the
stretch. ROAD HOUSE veered in sharply at the start forcing PERFECT SEASON to have to take up, then raced four wide close up behind the pacesetters,
struggled to keep pace through the turn and had nothing to offer in the stretch.
