Footnotes
NICHOLAS JAMES reserved off the early pace down the backside, circled four wide while rallying to the head of the lane and wore his rivals down in deep
stretch. FOX RED dueled on the lead from the rail to midway on the turn, settled back off the pressure, angled three wide into the clear at the head of the
lane, came on again to regain the lead in the final sixteenth and was caught late in a game effort. UNCLE EARL dueled on the lead from between horses
through the turn, shook clear briefly in mid-stretch and was outkicked late in the drive. BROADWAY JONES unhurried early while racing wide down the
backstretch and made a steady advance from six wide down the stretch. ZELIG went evenly without threatening. TIDE RISING squeezed between rivals
leaving the gate to drop back to trail and was never a factor. TWICE AS SMART pressed the pace from three wide down the backside, took a brief lead
nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch.

FROG TOWN tracked the leaders to the turn, rallied four wide around the bend, engaged the leader nearing the sixteenth pole and pulled clear at the wire.
SIMPLY VALID set a pressured pace from the fence to the top of the lane, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and was outkicked late in the drive. C
J ALL THE WAY unhurried in the early going to trail and made a steady mild rally down the stretch. CINDY'S STORM went evenly passing weakened rivals
in the lane. TOYI pressed the pace through the turn and weakened in the stretch. BOBBY'S GIFT contended early, was in tight on the turn against the rail,
dropped to the rear of the field and was never a threat from there.

DONNARUMMA tracked the leaders down the backstretch, waited behind a wall of rivals entering the far turn, circled five wide on the bend, dueled through
the stretch and got the head bob at the wire. MOONTAP was caught wide through the first turn, settled to race mid-pack from wide down the backside,
rallied four wide into the turn to challenge for the lead turning from home, battled the winner through the lane and was out-nodded. FABIOLA PRINCESS
prompted the pace to the final bend, took a brief lead nearing the quarter pole, was out-finished down the lane by the top pair while clearly the best of the
rest. PURDY PUMKIN set the pace from the rail for the first five-eighths and had no response when challenged on the final turn. STORMIN MELLY stalked
the pace and had no rally when called upon. POLITICAL ASTRAY broke wide leaving the gate, dropped in to save ground entering the first turn and never
posed a threat. KESTENNA (GB) was not a factor.

Footnotes
LUCKY PENNY ROSE unhurried in the early going to track the leaders, ranged up three wide with a strong rally on the far turn, cleared off in mid-stretch
and drew away to the wire convincingly. LINE DANCER pressed the pace from two wide to the final turn, assumed command on the bend, was no match for
the winner when engaged turning for home and kept on as second best. BOSSY LADY stalked the pace throughout and lacked a response when called
upon finishing evenly. SICILIAN STYLE TWO set a pressured pace for a half mile and weakened coming home. EARLY BLOOMER was never a factor.

Footnotes
LITTLE RONS ROCKET hopped at the start giving the field a couple lengths, raced near the rear of the filed while under unhurried, patient handling, rallied
five wide in the final bend to engage the leaders turning for home and pulled clear down the lane. INDY CARR tracked the leaders into the far turn, took a
brief lead near the quarter pole and kept on through the stretch as second best. ORLEANS STORM slow away from the gate, was reserved well off the pace
near the rear of the field and rallied in the stretch splitting rivals and showing good late interest. BIG TIME FLIRT was well placed three wide just off the
leaders in striking position throughout and failed to mount a closing rally. CHECK THE FACTS raced well wide through the first turn, dropped to the back of
the pack and passed tiring rivals in the lane. PLAYING BALL set the pace for a half mile and gave way turning for home. IPPOLITO'S WONDER stalked the
leader from the fence and lacked a response when called upon. AGNELLO CITY contended from the rail down the backside and faded. KETTLE KING was
never a threat.

Footnotes
COUNTRY CLUB BOBBY set a pressured pace from the fence, disposed of the initial pressure entering the far turn, was immediately engaged by the
runner-up, briefly surrendered the lead to that one in the lane, dug-in gamely to battle back and prevail. DARK VADER stalked the pace from three wide
down the backside, moved up to challenge the pacesetter on the turn, briefly took a short lead in the stretch and was denied at the wire in a good effort.
DERBY INCLUDED well placed along the rail in striking distance of the leaders, angled out four wide turning for home and finished with a mild bid to take
the show. BEAT THE DEALER tracked the pace from the fence into the far turn, was set to a drive early and lacked a closing response. HITE raced at the
back of the field to the stretch and passed tiring rivals in the lane. LUCKY STREAK went evenly never posing a threat. DOUGS MORNING PICK was not a
factor. JOSH'N pressed the pace for three quarters and gave way in the stretch.

QUEENIE ROSE unhurried in the early going to be at the rear of the field for a half mile, swept up three wide on the turn to engage the leader and crept
away steadily down the lane. HERE COMES DOLLY tracked the leaders down the backside, rallied two wide in the turn to be dueling on the lead with the
winner turning for home, could not go with that one but finished gamely as second best. SHAKA'S LYRIC set the pace under pressure down the
backstretch, dropped back losing position into the turn and finished evenly to gain the show. OH EYE SEE prompted the pace to far turn and weakened
coming home. ANGEL'S DESTINY rushed up to the leaders entering the backstretch while rank and pulling, took the lead approaching the half mile pole
and gave way on the final bend. TWILIGHT BEAUTY was outrun.

Footnotes
LADY JASPER stalked the pace through the far turn, rallied four wide in upper stretch and spurted away when clear late. MOBIL CHIC tracked the leader
from the fence while well held down the backside, rallied along the rail when the pacesetter drifted out turning for home and kept-on willingly in the lane to
take the place. SHAKEURSKINNYLEGS well rated on a comfortable lead, responded when challenged turning for home and couldn't last in the late going.
I'M LEGIT trailed to midway on the final bend and passed weakening rivals down the stretch. WILLIAMSBEACHBABE raced near the rear of the field
throughout, was set to a drive on the final bend and lacked a response. EMERSON JONES well placed from three wide down the backstretch, made a mild
bid in the final bend and flattened out.
