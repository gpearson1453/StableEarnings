HIGH STAKES laid up close in the four path, bid under a nudge in the three path rounding the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch, and drew clear.
ROYAL FOX HILLS bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the five path, was roused from the four path into the far turn, and chased on for place.
DECISIVE PRIDE rated in the two path, was cued in the three path midway around the far turn, swung from the six path into the stretch, and kept on while
on his left lead for show. ELEVATED CAUSEWAY bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed inside, tipped out to the two path midway around the far
turn, and finished evenly in the stretch. HARTSBEATLIKTHUNDR set the pace in the two path, was roused along the rail into the far turn, lost the lead in
upper stretch, and faded. PARADISE DRIVE was reluctant to load, chased in the four path, was ridden in the five path into the far turn, but flattened on his
left lead in the stretch. KADAR INDY raced wellback in the two path and never threatened. BULLETONTHECHARTS stalked inside but backed up rounding
the far turn, and had to steady passing the quarter. NETWORKING raced in midpack in the three path but was empty entering the stretch.

Footnotes
HAMMERSTEIN settled in range two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, seized command near the eighth pole, drew clear leaving the eighth
pole, drifted in then out while drawing clear and held safe under a drive. DASHMAN was bumped between foes at the start, raced three wide in midpack for
a half, was keen down the backstretch, angled four wide nearing the far turn, advanced four deep rounding that bend and kept on through the lane to just
hold the place. ENLIGHTEN had early speed inside, was content to stalk at the rail, angled three wide near the quarter pole, shifted further out in upper
stretch, rallied outside and just missed second. BEE PLUS veered in and bumped foes at the start, advanced three wide to the lead, cleared late on the first
turn, set the pace along the rail form there to the quarter pole, vied inside of the winner to midstretch and weakened a bit late. MODICA was off a bit slowly,
raced off the pace two wide, edged closer four wide around the far turn but lacked the needed stretch rally. WONDERFINN saved ground in range and
lacked a closing bid. THORNBURY failed to menace while racing two and three wide. SIR MAGESTRATE (IRE) was outrun inside. MY G was bumped at
the start, saved ground off the pace, inched closer two wide between foes around the far turn but faded through the lane. AZ U CHASE ME was outrun while
racing two to four wide. URGE TO MERGE (IRE) had early speed between foes while rank under a hard hold, bid between foes around the far turn but
came up empty in the lane. MISSOURI RIVER trailed inside, made some progress five wide around the far turn, angled back in near the quarter pole and
faltered.

Footnotes
KARAYA had early speed inside, angled out when TRUMPETS cleared nearing the far turn, stalked in the three path in the clear, slowly gained through the
lane and was up late. TRUMPETS was bumped at the start, sped to the front, set the pace in the two path, led to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly.
COOL TRICKS saved ground off the pace was along for the show. GLITTER BOMB chased the pace two wide and faded in the stretch. ZIPFIRE broke
inwardly and bumped TRUMPETS at the start, raced four wide and was never a threat. GRAND LADY MO played no factor while racing three wide.
NOBATIA chased the pace four wide, pulled up in the stretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
SELF TAUGHT trailed in the two path, was under right handed encouragement rounding the turn, tipped out to the six path passing the eighth pole, and
rallied to be up in the closing stages. MORGAN POINT prompted the pace in the five path, bid between foes in the two path passing the quarter, got
bumped out to the three path at the top of the stretch, ran on to lead going into the final furlong, but was caught by an outer foe late to place. REBELDE
rated in the six path, was cued in the four path midway around the turn, fanned out to the six path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. JOE DI
BAGGIO had to steady early, chased in the three path, was coaxed along around the turn, bid in the four path turning into the stretch, but flattened passing
the sixteenth. TOSCANITO set the pace in the three path, was challenged by an outer pair while along the inside passing the quarter, bumped an outer foe
while floating out to the two path at the top of the stretch, and yielded passing the eighth pole. MENELIK reared up at the start and lost the rider, was caught
shortly after the wire and walked off. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER THE STEWARDS HELD AN INQUIRY TO LOOK AT THE START.

Footnotes
BE MY SUNSHINE rated in range two wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch, took over nearing the eighth pole, drew clear then dug in late to just last.
BREATH AWAY (GB) was bumped after the start, raced off the pace three wide, swung six wide in upper stretch, closed outside and just missed. ALPHA
BELLA bumped at the start, stalked the pace in the three path, could not quicken with the winner in upper stretch but kept on willingly between foes for the
show. CAIRO CONSORT saved ground off the pace, went two wide between foes around the far turn, swung seven wide in upper stretch and rallied
outside. SUN BEE raced well back two wide, swung widest in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. IMPLICATED was bumped between foes not long after the
start, raced two wide in midpack around both turns and had only a mild stretch gain. STARTUP MENTALITY (IRE) was off slowly, raced three wide around
the first turn, advanced four wide around the far turn but was one-paced through the lane. ZIPADOO went evenly inside. RIDING PRETTY saved ground to
no avail. SPEED TRAP bumped at the start, set the pace in the two path to upper stretch and tired. DOLCE SOPRESA was pinched back at the start,
tracked the pace from the rail and faded in the stretch. PERSONAL PURSUIT played no factor while racing two and three wide.

SPIRIT WIND set an open pace in the two path, extended her advantage under a nudge around the turn, was cued passing the quarter, kicked on from the
two path into the stretch, started to drift out passing the sixteenth, but held on. INTREPID DAYDREAM was hustled along from in range in the three path,
ridden around the turn, floated out to the four path entering the stretch, and ran on for place. OLIVIA DARLING rated in the five path, was coaxed along
around the turn, urged from the five path into the stretch, and kept on for show. MY DESTINY raced off the pace in the three path, was coaxed along in the
two path around the turn, and stayed on in the three path down the stretch. BLUEFIELD raced wellback along the inside, was roused and shifted out
midway around the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and was gaining late but ran out of time. NAPA CANDY trailed in the six path
early and never threatened. MAGNA MASSA was prompted along in the two path but backed up early around the turn.

Footnotes
SIBELIUS vied three wide down the backstretch, drew clear in the two path around the turn and widened under left-handed urging in the lane. GILMORE
settled off the pace while racing four wide and rallied outside to gain the place late. DREAMING OF KONA raced off the pace two wide, angled to the rail in
upper stretch and ran on to gain the show on the wire. LONG RANGE TODDY dueled two wide between foes down the backstretch, chased the winner from
the rail around the turn, tipped two wide nearing the eighth pole, weakened and lost the show late. GREAT NAVIGATOR failed to menace while racing four
wide. HURRICANE J bumped at the start, moved up inside to duel down the backstretch, could not match strides entering the turn, angled three wide
nearing the three-eighths pole, chased outside and came up empty in the lane. HOWBEIT played no factor while racing two and three wide.
WINFROMWITHIN was bumped on both sides at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. SCARAMOUCHE was bumped at the start, had some
speed two wide but was through after a half.

Footnotes
SOUPER BLESSING settled in midpack in the three path, waited for room while under rousing around the far turn, found a seam in the four path at the top
of the lane, and was surging late to get up in the final strides. IRISH ACES stumbled out of the gate and trailed in the three path early, gradually shifted
outwards under coaxing midway around the far turn, fanned out to the nine path going into the stretch, and rallied for place. BOPPY O prompted the pace in
the three path, bid under a ride between foes turning into the stretch, kept on to lead passing the eighth pole, but was caught by an outer pair late to show.
ANGLOPHILE raced in midfield in the two path, angled out to the five path under a drive turning into the lane, and kicked on. OHANA HONOR raced
wellback in the four path, was roused between foes into the far turn, angled out to the seven path passing the eighth pole, bumped an outer foe around the
sixteenth, and mildly stayed on. SMOKEY MANDATE tracked in the three path, bid between foes passing the quarter, but finished evenly in the five path
down the lane. AMSTRONG steadied around the first turn, raced in midfield in the four path, ranged up four wide around the far turn, swung from the six
path into the stretch, but was one paced. TORIGO chased in the four path, was roused in the five path into the far turn, tipped out to the eight path turning
into the stretch, got bumped by an inner foe just before the sixteenth, and flattened. LEGACY ISLE set the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the
inside into the far turn, but faded in the stretch. MUTAAWID was unhurried along the inside early, had to check going into the far turn, and did not threaten
from the seven path in the stretch. APRIL FOOLS ANDY was held up in the two path, tipped to the rail and was roused into the far turn, but got stuck behind
a tiring foe and was shuffled back to last in upper stretch, and could not factor. EYES ON THE KING steadied around the first turn, stalked in the two path
but weakened in upper stretch.
