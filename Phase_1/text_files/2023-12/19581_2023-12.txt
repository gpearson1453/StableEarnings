Footnotes
JOHN JAY pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and drew off in the stretch. SILVER STYLE
bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, tracked the leaders up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and chased the winner home
in the lane. VEGAS PLAYBOY hit the gate leaving it, raced off the pace early, navigated the bend from the three path and passed tiring horses in the
stretch. STARRYSTARRYKNIGHT bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to press the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
dueled from the two path around the turn and was outkicked in the lane. BOLD BLUE stalked the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of a
mile, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the stretch. UNCAPTURED STAR led the way between horses up the backstretch, began to drop back
while racing in the two path around the turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
SAN COSTANTINO raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid while saving ground around the turn and kicked clear in
the stretch. FLIPPING FISH raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter, began a bid from the four path coming around the
bend and chased on in the lane. LORD BERRIER chased the pace setter on the inside early, continued around the turn in the three path and kept on to the
finish. REBEL EMPIRE led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and was caught entering the stretch but kept
on from there. GREAT FACES raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and made up some ground in the
lane but never threatened. PRINCELY GOD pressed the pace on the outside through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the three path and
faded in the lane. HAIL SOUTHERN trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and was never a factor.
