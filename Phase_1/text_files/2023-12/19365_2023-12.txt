Footnotes
CARAMEL CHIP broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, stalked the leading trio from the three to four path into the turn, ranged up while traveling
well to offer a bid at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear in hand entering the lane and was driven home to hold sway from an outer pursuer. BEVERLY
PARK laid off of the pace in the three path, crept closer moving between horses turning for home, tipped out to take aim on the newly clear leader from the
five path at the quarter pole and ran on well to prove second best. JUNIOR BUG broke a step slow, trailed early on, moved out of last in the three path
around the turn, swung out to the eight path in upper stretch and stayed on willingly. OPTIMAL COURAGE vied inside of a pair of rivals early on, but faded
into the turn, yet sustained stride while shifting out in upper stretch, then improved position in the five to six path and between horses passing the three
sixteenths pole. CONCRETE GLORY bumped an outer rival before taking contact from an inner foe at the start, vied two wide and between horses, tucked
to the inside while headed passing the three sixteenths pole, was swiftly outkicked by an outer bidder turning for home, sustained place-vying position
entering the lane, but tired in upper stretch. BREAKING NEWS tracked four wide, floated out to the six path entering the lane and faded between horses.
HIGH CRUISE received contact from an inner rival at the start, vied three deep into the turn, led narrowly as an outer rival loomed a danger turning for
home, proved no match for that one entering the lane and weakened between horses in upper stretch. WRATH was through early.

Footnotes
XYLOPHONE laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out approaching the backstretch, ranged up to the leaders in the five path around the far turn to
bid entering the lane, swept past in upper stretch and drew off while shifting in. MY GOOD FORTUNE trailed in the two path, moved forward in the three
path between horses around the far turn, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch and sustained a rally to edge place. HASHTAG LUCKY set the pace in
the two path, stalked an outer clearing counterpart with five furlongs to go, chased that one from the four path and between foes around the far turn, then
kept on mildly between horses entering the final sixteenth and forged show late. SAMARITA was restless in the starting gate, tugged forward four wide
around the first turn to vie for the lead entering the backstretch, cleared leaving the five furlong pole, showed the way in the three path around the far turn,
but proved no match for an outer bidder in upper stretch, tired and lost show late. PENS STREET lacked speed in the three to two path, shifted out in upper
stretch and moved up. INVALUABLE pursued from midpack in the two path, chased in the three path along with an outer pair around the far turn, then
yielded. CHOCTAW BINGO tracked in the three path, got floated to the seven path with five furlongs to go, tucked behind foes approaching the far turn,
moved down to the inside around that bend and failed to menace. GIRL THIRSTY lacked speed along the inside and got outrun. HOT DAME tracked along
the inside, but moved out down the backstretch then faded in the six path around the far turn.

Footnotes
ANATOLIAN lacked speed in the two path, crept closer while tracking behind the main group from the three path and among foes around the far turn,
smoothly took aim in the five path and between rivals in upper stretch, bid at the furlong grounds and drove clear entering the final sixteenth. ENCHANTED
NILE laid off of the pace two wide, tugged three wide and between horses down the backstretch, gained in the four path around the far turn to bid turning for
home, led into the lane, embraced an outer challenge coming to the furlong grounds, got headed at the marker, then held place from pursuing foes on either
side through the late stages. DANA'S BEAUTY prompted along the inside, stalked down the backstretch, chased two wide and between horses around the
far turn, split foes to attempt a bid inside of the leaders coming to midstretch, but only managed to chase in the final furlong and was denied place. INDICIA
broke a step slow and transferred light contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the start, trailed in the three to five path early on, rallied in the five to six
path around the far turn to attempt a bid entering the lane, but leveled off, chased through the final furlong and missed show. YANKEE DOLLAR pursued
from midpack along the inside, but was shuffled back behind a faltering foe around the far turn, trailed before shifting out entering the lane and kept on.
STRONG ODOR brushed a inner rival at the star, tracked in the four path, bid outside of the leader and from the three path inside the three furlong pole,
vied into the lane but yielded to outer rivals in upper stretch. ANNIE'S SONG (IRE) took mild contact from an outer rival at the start, stalked in the three to
two path between horses exiting the first turn, pressed soon after, led in the two path into the far turn, but was headed inside of a trio of foes with five
sixteenths to go and weakened. SWOONATRA showed speed in the four to three path around the first turn, cleared and tucked in down the backstretch, but
was headed by an outer presser entering the far turn and weakened through the final three furlongs.

TIME FOR TROUBLE lacked speed in the two path, launched a rally splitting foes in the four path entering the lane, altered course outwardly coming to
midstretch, sustained progress to bid at the sixteenth pole, sparred with an inner rival through the late stages and prevailed. PROVERB pursued from
midpack in the three to two path, inched closer in the three path along with an outer rival around the far turn, fanned to the seven path entering the lane,
sustained a grinding charge to bid along with an outer foe at the sixteenth pole, dueled with that one thereafter but got outfinished. MISSED THE BOAT
stalked in the three path, bid outside of the leader approaching the half mile pole, vied between horses into the far turn, but was headed by his outer
counterpart turning for home, kept on to offer a rebid in midstretch but yielded to a pair of outer rivals entering the final sixteenth. COACH ADAMS tracked in
the four path, pressed the top pair into the far turn, cleared turning for home, but faltered between rivals at the sixteenth pole. ON A SPREE laid off of the
pace two wide, inched closer in the four path around the far turn, but was floated to the eight path entering the lane and leveled off. MAU MAU lacked speed
in the four to five path and moved up. TOMA TODO stalked in the two path, chased turning for home and faded. WILLY THE COBBLER broke a step slow,
pursued from the five to three path around the first turn, then gave way between horses around the far turn. CASEYS MEMORY saved ground off of the
pace but to no avail. SCOOTER'S BOY made little impact. MOMENT set the pace along the inside, but yielded to an outer pair around the far turn and
caved.

COUNTERSTRIKE brushed with rivals on both sides at the start, tracked four wide, ranged up to bid entering the lane, dueled with an inner rival through
midstretch but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole. TILTED TOWERS tracked from midpack in the three path, shifted out to the six path
in upper stretch, grinded away on his left lead, but was outkicked by an outer rival in the final furlong and needed more to reach place. COTTON settled well
back in the four path, floated to the seven path entering the lane and moved up. SMITHWICK'S SPICE failed to menace from the three path.
BODENHEIMER sped clear early on, dug in to resist an outer bidder entering the lane, sparred gamely through midstretch but yielded entering the final

Footnotes
RICHIESONAROLL pursued the main group from the five path, chased while floating to the middle of the track in upper stretch, yet kicked in late to bid
outside of tiring rivals in the closing stages and prevailed at the wire. STARTDFROMDABOTTOM stalked outside of the leader, pressed from the three path
around the turn, floated to the five path entering the lane, chased hanging on his left lead while being herded outwardly by the drifting leader through
midstretch, changed over before offering a bid at the sixteenth pole, forged an advantage in the closing stages but got nailed at the wire. FAITHFUL RULER
showed the way in the two path as an outer rival applied pressure around the turn, shifted out to the four path entering the lane, held sway while drifting
multiple paths outwardly through midstretch, but was bested by an outer pair in the final sixteenth and saved show from an inner rival. PURE PANIC raced
forwardly along the inside, chased through the lane in hopes of offering a bid inside of the leaders entering the final sixteenth but flattened out. LIKE A
SALTSHAKER tracked three wide, shifted out to the eight path in upper stretch and chased evenly. DESERT RULER laid off of the pace two wide and
between horses then failed to menace. TWIRLING ROSES failed to factor three wide. BIG ROWDY DAN broke slowly, trailed along the inside, entered the
lane in the six path and moved up. SOLIDIFY broke slowly and made little impact from the four path. PESO IN MY POCKET saved ground off of the pace
and tired.

RUNWAY MAGIC stalked from the four path, pressed the leader approaching the far turn, gained an advantage turning for home, shifted out to the six path
entering the lane and held sway from an inner bidder. DUKE OF CARTHANIA broke outwardly, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, inched
closer to the top pair around the far turn, took aim between them in upper stretch, bid at the furlong grounds but was turned away in the final sixteenth.
TATANKA set the pace in the three path, got headed by an outer presser around the far turn, yielded to the top pair at the furlong grounds yet kept on to
prove best of the rest. RACE CRAFT chased along the inside, shifted out entering the lane and lacked a bid. SONNY SMACK trailed, took the far turn in the
six path, improved position entering the lane but flattened out without reaching contention. FIREWATER JAKE laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted
out between horses turning for home and failed to factor. TIBERIUS MERCURIUS pursued from midpack in the five path, chased turning for home and
weakened between horses.

MONEY SUPPLY broke through the gate pre-race but was re-loaded without further incident, shied between horses soon after the start, settled off of the
pace in the three to two path, retreated to trail between horses turning for home, picked up stride shifting to the four path entering the lane, rallied to split the
leaders at the furlong grounds and drove clear. LUIGI'S SPIRIT lacked speed in the two path, pursued from the five to six path around the far turn before
fanning to the seven path entering the lane, offered a grinding charge outside of rivals, but was bumped while getting outkicked by an inner foe at the furlong
grounds, stayed on thereafter to bid for place in the final sixteenth and edged that position. FROSTED GRACE stalked three wide, bid at the three furlong
pole, led entering the lane, but drifted out in upper stretch, dug in approaching the furlong grounds, but was bested by an inner rival approaching the
sixteenth pole and lost place to an outer bidder late. BRIGHT SPARK was slow into stride and lagged behind,, swung from the three path to the eight path
entering the lane and ran on. FIRST GLIMPSE settled off of the pace in the four path, pursued in the four to six path around the far turn, then chased behind
rivals in upper stretch, bumped an outer foe at the furlong pole and lacked a bid. KING'S OVATION set the pace in the two path, met challenges from rivals
on either side at the three furlong pole, got headed by his outer counterpart nearing the lane, fought on through midstretch but yielded a sixteenth from
home. SAQEEL stalked along the inside, bid inside of the leader at the three furlong pole, vied on his left lead in upper stretch but tired in the final furlong.
BILOXI tracked in the four path, chased the leading trio from within striking range around the far turn, entered the lane in the five path and faded between
horses. ALL WEST pursued from the two path then faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
HI YAH vied three wide, cleared approaching midstretch and lasted between bidders. MYGLORYBEE trailed in the four to five path, then surged between
horses in midstretch, sustained a rally to offer a late rail bid, but missed. LIKE THIS chased the leading trio from the three to four path, sustained a grinding
charge through midstretch, closed in on the tiring leader late but ran out of ground. KING'S LUTE pursued from the five path, drifted out and chased from
the eight path into the final furlong, then kept on. TWOFEXUSNEXUS took contact from an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path five
path, shifted out to the nine path in the final furlong and stayed on belatedly. GUTZY pursued from the two path, then chased one-paced between horses.
COMANCHE WARRIOR vied two wide and between horses, failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart in upper stretch and yielded through the final
sixteenth. LIL WOADIE made little impact while hung in the six path. MALAKI EMPIRE broke a step slow, pursued from the four to six path and tired.
CHECK ME OUT rankly broke in and bumped a rival at the start, then made little impact along the inside. TRIPPLE D RULLER vied inside of a pair of foes
and weakened in midstretch. ANDERS SMILE was outrun and eased through the final furlong.
