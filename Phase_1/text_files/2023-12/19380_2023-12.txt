Footnotes
DUST MAKER settled inside, improved position two wide into the far turn, tipped to the four path into the stretch and was asked for run heading to the
furlong marker, vied for the lead while widest into the final sixteenth, took command into deep stretch and kept to task in the final strides to prevail over the
oncoming runner-up. I'M GONNA SHINE settled outside of runners to begin, was content to trail through the backstretch run, was guided to the two path
into the second turn and improved position at the quarter marker, mounted an inside rally into the stretch, loomed at the furlong marker, finished well in deep
stretch and just missed for the win at the wire, while holding safely for second. J AND M EXPRESS tracked three wide early, well placed through the
backstretch run, improved position two wide into the second turn, gained command into the stretch, battled into the final sixteenth, vied between rivals into
deep stretch, was outfinished by the top pair and was well clear for third. TIGERIZE tracked the pace from the second flight, saved ground into the far turn,
rallied two wide into the stretch, needed more in the final sixteenth and could not muster a response in deep stretch. FRESNO CHILE unhurried, saved
ground into the first turn, lost position two wide into the far turn, swung to the four path into the stretch, advanced at the furlong marker, needed more in the
final stages and did not threaten. MISSING PENNY hustled leaving the break, set the early pace and opened to a clear lead heading to the half-mile marker,
maintained a clear lead to the quarter marker, was overtaken heading to the furlong grounds and tired. BOBBY'S GENIE showed early speed away from the
gate and was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the pace from a two wide path into the backstretch run and tracked to the half-mile marker, chased
from the rail along the far turn, remained within aim into the stretch and ran in pursuit to the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and
gave way in deep stretch.

Footnotes
YOU KIDDING ME took back off of the contentious early pace, was unhurried while two wide through the backstretch run, made a steady gain into the far
turn, chased two wide to the quarter marker and came in tight at the top of the stretch, angled four wide at the furlong grounds, was full of run into the drive,
made a quick move to take command into the final sixteenth and drew clear in deep stretch to be much the best. MADE THE TEAM asked for run away from
the start and assumed command in the early stages, was engaged by BIG DON'S SMILING and disputed the pace with that rival into the first turn,
contested decent fractions through the backstretch run and dueled into the far turn, shook free into the stretch and showed the way to the furlong marker,
was overhauled by YOU KIDDING ME in the final sixteenth and just held for second at the finish. DUPLICATION tracked the contentious early pace from a
two wide position, gained ground heading to the half-mile marker, was coaxed along three wide into the second turn and came within aim at the quarter
marker, chased MADE THE TEAM into the stretch, could not muster the needed late response, was outfinished in deep stretch and just missed for second
at the wire. THE SANDY SURPRISE allowed to settle away from the start, saved ground into the first turn, tracked the contentious pace through the
backstretch run, was roused four wide into the far turn and improved position at the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive, lost ground at the furlong
marker and weakened in deep stretch. SURPRISE FASHION unhurried leaving the break, settled at the rear and saved ground into the first turn, saved all
of the ground while trailing into the far turn, improved position into the stretch but was unable to threaten in the late stages. BIG DON'S SMILING showed
speed leaving the break and was prominent into the first turn, engaged with MADE THE TEAM and contested the pace with that runner into the backstretch,
dueled through decent fractions into the far turn, lost position into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BUYBACK broke well but was beaten to the first turn, then was content to rate behind the pacesetting TOP ANTICIPATION (GB) the whole of the
backstretch run, was looking for room to get clear from the half mile pole but the path to the outside was blocked by NAUGHTY NADINE (GB), bided time to
the stretch, then found a seam just past the three-sixteenths marker, tipped out, responded to strong handling, took command passing the sixteenth pole
and was drawing away in the end. NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) broke well and took up a stalking position under some restraint just behind and to the outside of
stablemate TOP ANTICIPATION (GB), held that position to the far turn, was set down in the stretch, took over the lead when that one began to weaken but
was unable to hold off the late charge of the winner. A CROWN FOR KITTEN lacked speed from the break, angled over to the two path to save ground
through the first bend, tracked the pace from the back of the compact field, then was set down near the five-sixteenths marker, was still last in mid-stretch,
then found another gear late and gained third. TOPANTICIPATION (GB) broke well and was pushed to grab the early lead, with stablemate NAUGHTY
NADINE stalking to the outside, set reasonable fractions under some restraint to the far turn, opened up a bit on the turn, gave way to NAUGHTY NADINE
passing the furlong marker and weakened in the final furlong. UNFAITHFUL WAYS unhurried from the break, was content to save ground near the back of
the field tried stayed to the inside through the far turn, waited through the turn without a path to the outside tried to rally once clear but did not have the
needed response. RIVETING SPIRIT was not asked for speed from the break and was content to let the pace scenario play out through the first turn, then
pulled forward while racing three wide down the backstretch, launched a bid with three furlongs to run, loomed a threat at the quarter pole but was outrun
down the stretch.

Footnotes
CAPTIVATING BOY broke alertly and conceded the early lead, raced close up to the solid early while outside of the leading trio, advanced four wide into the
turn and took command heading to the quarter marker, kicked to a clear lead into the stretch, was kept to task while holding a clear lead into the final
sixteenth and was hand ridden to the finish as much the best. SQUALOTORO rated nicely leaving the break and tracked from the second flight, chased two
wide into the turn, angled three wide into upper stretch and chased to the furlong marker, finished well into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner in
deep stretch but stayed on and was up in time to secure the runner-up honors. GOLDENSUNRISE sent leaving the break and assumed command of the
early running, set solid fractions into the turn, was overtaken by CAPTIVATING BOY approaching the quarter marker, chased that rival into the stretch,
weakened in the late stages and was outfinished for second in the final strides, while just holding in the end for third. TOWN PERFORMER pulled on the
rider in the early going and pressed the solid pace between runners, lost position into the turn and chased two wide to the quarter pole, ran in pursuit into
the stretch, re-rallied in the final sixteenth and missed for third at the finish. MR. FIGHTER took back off of the solid early pace, improved position into the
turn and chased three then four wide at the quarter pole, swung widest into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong marker, re-rallied into the final
sixteenth but needed more in deep stretch. NASHVILLE SKYLINE prominent early, raced close up to the solid early pace while three deep, lost position into
the turn and chased three wide to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the final stages. BLAZEN GRAZEN chased the solid
early pace, saved ground into the turn, was pulled up into upper stretch and was vanned off.

MURPHYS TIGER away in good order and was forwardly placed to begin, raced close up to the solid early pace and maintained a four wide path into the
turn, gained ground four wide at the quarter marker, tipped five wide for the drive and loomed at mid-stretch, vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker
and took command into the final sixteenth, showed a good late kick into deep stretch and kept to task in the late stages to prevail over the oncoming
runner-up. DOO WOP DON squeezed leaving the break, was away slowly and spotted the field to begin, chased from the rear in the early stages and was
guided outside of rivals into the turn, gained ground four wide at the quarter pole, swung to the six path into upper stretch and continued his rally at the
furlong marker, closed willingly into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and was up in time to secure second. LOVE'EM N
LEAVE'EM tracked the solid early pace from the inside, gained ground into the turn, vied for the lead into upper stretch and held a narrow advantage
approaching the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth, was outfinished for second in deep stretch and held safely for
third. ARMA D'ORO rated off of the contentious early pace, tracked from the inside into the turn then waited for racing room nearing the quarter marker,
found room into upper stretch and mounted an inside rally at the furlong pole, was outkicked into the final sixteenth but ran on in deep stretch and improved
position. GOLDEN ALE broke in a step at the start and bumped MR. STANG, was sent to dispute the solid early pace and dueled with HONEYMOONZ
OVER into the turn, lost the lead to LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM into upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker, fought to the sixteenth-pole and weakened.
HONEYMOONZ OVER broke sharply and assumed command away from the start, was engaged by GOLDEN ALE and contested the solid early pace with
that rival heading to the turn, raced three wide into the turn and disputed the pace to the quarter pole, lost the lead into upper stretch and chased to the
furlong grounds, lacked a response in the final sixteenth and gave way. MR. STANG bumped at the start by his stablemate then crowded DOO WOP DON
leaving the break, recovered and was prominent while pulling on the rider in the early going, tracked the pace between runners into the turn, came in tight
midway through the bend, steadied and lost position approaching the quarter marker, chased into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SING A HAPPY SONG broke sharply then easily gained the lead with the rider keeping a tight hold, extended the lead through the turn when let loose,
came into the stretch with the rider sitting still, then drew off as much the best under a brisk hand ride. ALONG CAME JOANN lunged at the start, then was
green and hard to place in the early stages, settled into stride, bided time at the rear of the tracking group through the turn, tried to go through a hole to the
outside that closed then ducked inside, found some room and ran on well to gain the second spot. ENCOLPION took a bump from MERRY BLUE at the
break tried to hustle to the front then settled at the rear of the tracking group when outrun in the early stages, stayed to the outside in the four to five path,
came under a ride from the three furlong pole, swung four or five wide into the stretch, kept to task and gained the third spot. SOO BROOKLYN tracked the
early pace up while racing up close on the inside of the group chasing the early leaders, kept to the inside through the turn then split horses at the top of the
stretch, ran on with some intent but was outfinished for a minor award. NORTHERN LINCHPIN came away well and chased SING A HAPPY SONG through
the early stages, tried to make a run at that foe from the seven-sixteenths but was no match, held the second spot through the turn then flattened out in
deep stretch. MERRY BLUE broke outward at the start, taking the path of ENCOLPION, then steadied off heels about a half furlong in, dropped back to last,
then swung out to five path for clear running down the backstretch, chased the field the rest of the way and was unable to overcome early troubles but did
manage to pass a couple at the end. INVENTING ANNA raced between horses in the tracking group, began to struggle to keep pace passing the
five-sixteenths pole and had nothing to offer in the stretch. FLY SOUTH was prominent through the early going while racing four wide down the backstretch,
came under pressure passing the quarter pole shortened strides in the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
MOGOLLON RIM allowed to settle leaving the break and saved ground into the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run and was coaxed along two
wide into the second turn, tipped three wide for the drive and loomed at mid-stretch, took command at the furlong marker and battled with his stablemate
into the final sixteenth, determinedly held the runner-up at bay into deep stretch and held in a drive to prevail. MOOGIE SON unhurried in the early stages
and settled two wide into the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run, continued his advance three then four wide along the far turn, rallied into
upper stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, battled gamely with MOGOLLON RIM into the final sixteenth, could not get by his determined stablemate in
deep stretch and was well clear in the end for second. VANTAGE POINT forwardly placed away from the start and stalked the pace into the first turn,
advanced into the backstretch run and prompted the solid pace to the half-mile marker, dueled with EL ALTO HOMBRE into the far turn and battled into
upper stretch, was overtaken by the top pair at the furlong marker, battled with EL ALTO HOMBRE into deep stretch and outfinished that runner in the final
strides to secure show honors. EL ALTO HOMBRE broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, set the pace into the first turn, was engaged by
VANTAGE POINT into the backstretch run and set prompted fractions to the half-mile marker, dueled with VANTAGE POINT into the far turn and carved out
solid fractions to the quarter pole, battled with VANTAGE POINT into upper stretch then lost the lead heading to the furlong marker, weakened into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished for third in the final strides. ROCKTILLYOUDROP well placed in the early going and saved ground into the first turn, tracked
the decent pace through the backstretch run and saved all of the ground into the far turn, ran evenly into the stretch and lacked a late rally. FORE FLAG
settled off of the early pace and raced two wide into the first turn, tracked the decent pace while not far back heading to the half-mile pole, was guided
outside of runners into the far turn and came three wide to the quarter pole, lost ground into the stretch and did not offer a late response. ADARE pulled on
the rider and was forwardly placed in the early running, continued to tug on the rider into the backstretch and stalked the decent pace to the half-mile
marker, chased three wide to the quarter pole, dropped back into the stretch, was eased through the final furlong and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
SATANTA settled near the rear of the field in the early stages, then was patiently ridden through the turn, navigated an inside run into the stretch, tipped out
to the three path near the eighth pole, powered to the front and won going away. DINOS DIXIE broke sharply, vied for the early lead with PIPER'S
CAUSEWAY then dropped back to a stalking position and remained there to the turn, made an early challenge passing the seven-sixteenths pole but was
rebuffed, re-engaged in the stretch, got the advantage passing the eighth pole but was unable to hold of the fast closing winner. PIPER'S CAUSEWAY
broke well and was hustled to the front, opened up a clear lead from the five furlong marker, fended off an early bid from DINO'S DIXIE on the turn then
battled back gamely when that one came back on in the stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth but held third. J T'S WATCH got a good break then raced in
the four or five path on outside of the tracking group behind the early leaders, continued to race three to four wide through the turn, swung out to the seven
path for the stretch run and was kept to task under steadily handling and produced a mild late run despite drifting in during the late stages. DESOTO'S WAR
raced inside of three horses tracking the pace, came under a ride from the five-sixteenths pole then ran on evenly in the stretch. COUNTING CARDS was
between horses tracking the early leaders, got in tight at the top of the stretch, steadied off heels and was unable to recover. DECIMATE broke well, kept to
the inside, was prominent to the stretch then tired. JERRY JEFF WALKER was outrun from the break, chased down the backstretch, saved ground but was
unable to make up any ground in the late stages while running a bit erratically in deep stretch.
