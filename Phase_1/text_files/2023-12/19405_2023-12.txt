in some near the nine-sixteenths, went four wide on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch, pursued the winner on the outside while remaining on his
inside lead in the drive and secured the place. RYAN'S CAT was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive,

Footnotes
BUSSIA chased the pace down the backstretch, went around most of the turn in the two path then shifted four wide, gained to take the lead into upper
stretch, dueled outside the runner-up to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. GHOSTBUSTIN displayed good speed and showed in front
early, lost the lead before the nine-sixteenths then pressed on the outside, vied in the three path for most of the turn then dropped to the two path, spun
three wide into the stretch, dueled inside of the winner to the finish and just missed while narrowly able to get the place. FOXY CARA was sent hard from
the gate then urged along on the inside, saved ground on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, gained in the final furlong and finished with
good courage to just miss while up for the show. EASTERN STAR was coaxed along early, dropped back while ridden along near the nine-sixteenths then
began to climb into kickback, went two to three wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and improved position. MOONLIT WEEKEND broke a step
slow, moved up on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, chased in the stretch, gained some late but missed the superfecta. SHE'S A
NATURAL was urged along towards the front, chased four to five wide on the turn, pursued the leaders in the stretch and lacked the needed kick.
KRYSTALHEIR was hard ridden at the rear, moved to the outside near the five-eighths pole, went five wide on the turn, drifted in outside the sixteenth-pole
and was no factor. STEPPIN' HAWK moved up to get the lead before the nine-sixteenths, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on
the turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch and gave way. RED JASMINE threw her head at the start and was off slow while awkwardly away, spotted the
front several lengths, saved ground on the turn and never reached contention.
