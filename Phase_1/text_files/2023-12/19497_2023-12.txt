TOO BAD JUSTICE contested a pressured pace through the backstretch and kept the edge at the rail rounding the turn, dueled clear past the eighth pole
and held on well with steady handling. HINK'S PALADIN pressured the pace and contested at a slim disadvantage two deep on the turn, relented in the
stretch duel for second but held on for second. BE BE BOP gave chase, rounded the turn at the rail and ran evenly in the lane. E J'S REVENGE veered out
leaving the gate then gave chase, raced in the five path on the turn and flattened in the lane. JIMMY THE KID gave chase through the backstretch, raced off
the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. CHARITABLY GIFTED chased, raced in the four path on the turn and weakened in the stretch. BALI'S
SHADE gave chase and rounded the turn about the five path. PRIMETIME JET broke a step slow and saved ground on the turn.

URKILLINGMEBETH saved ground the opening turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and closed steadily, was eased to the five path through the
far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and took the lead in the final yards. GOLD TIME VIXEN stalked from the three path the first turn and raced at even
terms past the half mile pole, dueled from the seven sixteenths, took the nod two deep midway on the far turn and dug in under steady stretch handling, but
was caught in the final yards. JAMESTOWN ROAD stalked two deep, moved to even terms past the half mile pole and had the nod leaving the seven
sixteenths, but was met at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened inside the sixteenth pole. SO RED THE ROSE rounded the first turn in the three
path, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened. MISS WILD rated the early pace inside, was met leaving the half
mile pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back at the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
PAPA LINGUINE settled well back toward the inside on the first turn, eased out with a bid into the backstretch and steadily progressed, raced in the three
path on the far turn, dug in for the lead late stretch and drew away nearing the wire. SHOOT THE BREEZE stalked from the four path the first turn, bid
nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead leaving the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in under steady handling; relented late
yards and just lasted for second. LOVE IS WICKED saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the
far turn and finished well to take third the final yards. OUTLAW BILLY stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole
and contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn, but dropped back mid-stretch and flattened later yards. SEABROOK ISLAND rated close
off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened mid-stretch. VALHALLA'S PALACE took
over at the rail into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, was met passing the five sixteenths and faded
at the rail on the far turn. DANTE'S INFERNO raced in the five path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed little
response. RUDD'S ROCKET bobbled at the break, raced in the three path the opening turn and proved no factor. SEATTLE PRINCE bobbled leaving the
gate then stalked two deep the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. SAN SEBASTIAN
came away awkwardly, raced in the three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.
