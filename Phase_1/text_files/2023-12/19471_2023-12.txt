Footnotes
ICE BAR saved ground well back from early contention, started a bid into the backstretch and steadily progressed from there, circled rivals six wide on the
far turn and dug in determinedly to take over the final yards. RRACE DAY WARRIOR settled off the rail early on, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and
raced five wide on the far turn, dug in with the edge leaving the eighth pole but was outfinished in the final yards. POLAR WIND settled back in the four and
five paths, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn, eased out at the head of the lane and dug in to take
third later yards. SUBJECT TO CHANGE settled off the pace in the four and five paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the edge in
the three path on the far turn, but flattened leaving the eighth pole. BLAMEITONTHEFUN stalked from the three path then took a slim lead nearing the half
mile pole, dueled from the three eighths pole but was met while between horses midway on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. MR HOOVER stalked
two deep then challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced close at the rail on the far turn then weakened in the lane. BLUEMOON JUSTICE saved
ground. ALWAYS FORGIVEN raced well back in the three and four paths and showed little response through the backstretch. MAKE WAY raced well back
and was not a factor. HONOR THE FLEET rated a slim lead inside, was met nearing the half mile pole and gave chase, but faded toward the quarter pole.

Footnotes
MOON FALL stalked off the rail then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested even terms two deep on the far turn and dug in determinedly
to edge clear later yards. CALLISTO'S BRIGADE stalked from the three path, took the lead three wide past the seven sixteenths pole, contested even terms
at the rail on the far turn and dueled close through the upper stretch, but reluctantly ceded later yards. JUST MURPHY bobbled leaving the gate then saved
ground, picked up the chase past the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, dug in from the head of the lane but flattened stride later
yards. LORD CLANCY raced in the five path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, though,
flattened in the lane. THEIRREGISTRDIMNOT settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the
three and four paths and showed little further. JUBA'S MOCHA became anxious in the gate then saved ground, picked up the chase approaching the three
eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. GAMBLING FEVER became anxious in the gate then took a quick lead and
moved to the inside to show the way, was met leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point but dropped back toward the five sixteenths
and weakened at the rail on the far turn. COLONIAL ROAD raced in the five path the first turn and never factored.

lead the final yards. SPRITZER took the lead and angled to the inside to show the way, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, raced at the
rail on the far turn and dug in under steady encouragement through the lane, but was outfinished in the final yards. SUPERSTITIEUX was shuffled back
shortly after the break and settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then
dueled through the stretch for third. SIR SMOAK settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced in range of the
lead in the three path on the far turn but flattened leaving the eighth pole. AKINGISALWAYSKING stalked from the five path the opening turn, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and weakened in the lane. DAD'S LIL SPARK saved ground on the first turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, eased out into the lane and showed little more. WINDSOR'S TRACKER stalked
two deep the first turn, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the rail into the far turn. RIVER CROSROAD RVF stalked the earlier
pace from the four path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened. MR CHANCE ROMANCE
became a bit fractious in the gate then saved ground close to the early pace, gave chase past the half mile pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
BAR FOURTEEN broke out and made contact with Golden Spoke then took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the five
sixteenths pole, contested even terms at the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to eke out the nod over the game stretch challenge of ZEN
MASTER, who stalked from the three path the first turn and gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled to even terms in the three path midway on
the far turn and dug in gamely to the finish. KENNY HAD A NOTION stalked two deep then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but dropped back
off the rail midway on the far turn and flattened in the lane. SUE LOVES BARBADOS was forced outward at the break then settled in the three path the first
turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little further. GOLDEN SPOKE was
squeezed at the break then saved ground, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, eased outward entering the
stretch and showed little more. TWO BIT KID rated close inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and
weakened into the lane. TREJO broke inward and made contact with Golden Spoke then dropped well back. MONSTER MASON ducked outward at the
break, raced in the five path on the opening turn then gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, though, showed little response.

Footnotes
HONEYCAMP stalked off the rail the first turn, edged closer approaching the quarter pole and took the lead three wide past the pole, raced clear toward the
head of the lane and was kept alert to widen the final sixteenth. SUPERSNAKE rated close inside, bid nearing leaving the seven sixteenths pole, eased
outward midway on the far turn and left the turn about the five path, then dueled to clear second later yards. KATALIMA settled off the rail the first turn, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and came along to take third later yards. WINDSOR'S PLAY took the lead
nearing the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to set the pace, was met approaching the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, but
dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened in the lane. BEST VIRGINIA rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase nearing
the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the five path and showed little in the lane. TRUST THE NUMBERS stalked from the three path
the first turn, took a slim lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms from that point, but was met while between horses past the
quarter pole and weakened in the lane. WISHING FOR SPRING saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened
stride at the rail on the far turn. CONNECTING FLIGHT rounded the first turn about the four path and loped around.
