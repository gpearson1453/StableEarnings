Footnotes
MAYBE DOLCIE stalked the pace while inside, saved ground on the run then rallied inside in upper stretch, slipped through to take command and was in a
strong drive to be best in the end. CODE OF THE SOUTH was unhurried early while two wide into the turn, rallied inside in the stretch and closed ground
willingly in late stretch and was along for the place. PAULA M dueled for the lead while inside into the turn, was in a long drive but weakened in late stretch.
LOW EURO CAT dueled for the lead while two wide into the turn, was in a long drive but faltered in the stretch. LET HER BUCK chased the early pace
while three wide into the turn, made a bid then gave way. SLICK CITY GIRL was unhurried early then was no factor. GOSPEL TIZ SOSWEET was
unhurried early and inside on the turn but was no threat. UNBRIDLED KISSES raced four wide into the turn and was no factor.
