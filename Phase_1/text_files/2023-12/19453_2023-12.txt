pace, tracked while saving ground into the turn, chased to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong. BOOK EM TAMO close up early while outside of

Footnotes
OLD TRIANGLE tracked the early pace from the inside, was well placed while tracking through the backstretch run, coaxed along two wide into the second
turn, tipped three wide for the drive and loomed into upper stretch, took command approaching the furlong marker, kicked clear nearing the sixteenth-pole
and pulled away in the late stages to be much the best. J. B. BOOKS broke out at the start and squeezed a neighboring rival, settled off of the early pace
while not far back, maintained a two wide path through the backstretch run and gained ground at the half-mile marker, raced in tight into the far turn,
steadied off of heels approaching the quarter marker and was steered three wide into upper stretch, chased OLD TRIANGLE to the furlong marker, was no
match for the winner in the final sixteenth and ran on to be best of the rest. SUPER ELLIE forwardly placed leaving the break, tracked the early pace three
deep along the first turn, gained ground into the backstretch run and was well placed heading to the half-mile marker, advanced into the far turn and vied for
the lead three wide at the quarter pole, battled into upper stretch, was outkicked heading to the furlong marker, weakened in the final stages and just held
for third at the finish. DIAMOND CONCERTO squeezed leaving the break and was away slowly, was unhurried into the first turn and saved ground into the
backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, made a steady gain two wide along the far turn and continued that rally into the stretch,
could not sustain his run into the final sixteenth, flattened out and just missed for third. PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL forwardly placed in the early stages,
stalked the pace along the first turn then advanced to prompt the pace into the backstretch run, attended to the moderate pace heading to the half-mile
marker, gained command approaching the quarter pole and led into the stretch, was overtaken heading to the furlong marker and gave way in the final
stages. AUTISM INCLUSION allowed to settle, tracked the moderate pace outside of rivals through the backstretch run, was coaxed along four wide
heading to the quarter pole and did not threaten in the stretch. THOMPSON hustled leaving the break and assumed command into the first turn, set
prompted fractions into the backstretch run and carved out a moderate pace heading to the half-mile marker, lost position along the far turn, stopped in
upper stretch, was eased through the final furlong and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
EL BERRINCHES forwardly placed leaving the break, tracked the solid early pace and saved ground into the turn, maintained an inside path to the quarter
pole and was well placed nearing the top of the lane, responded to urging in upper stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, confronted GOLD RUSH
CANDY and battled with that rival into the final sixteenth, shook free into deep stretch and kicked clear in the final stages to prevail. GOLD RUSH CANDY
showed good early speed and was prominent leaving the break, engaged with SCHOCHOH and disputed solid fractions with that rival into the turn, dueled
while carving out a quick pace heading to the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and showed the way to the furlong marker, met the bid of EL
BERRINCHES into the final sixteenth, was outkicked by the winner in deep stretch and held in the end for second. EMERALD MAGIC asked to rate in the
early going, came in a bit tight while between runners entering the turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, maintained that path into the stretch, gained
ground at the furlong marker, finished well in the late stages and held for third at the finish. R M C HOOK'EM tracked the contentious early pace from the
outside, raced three wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive, shifted six wide at mid-stretch, found his best stride late and just missed for
third. PERFORMATIVE tracked the early pace three wide, tipped four wide for the stretch run and closed willingly in the final sixteenth. SCHOCHOH sent
leaving the break, engaged with GOLD RUSH CANDY and disputed solid fractions outside of that runner into the turn, contested the pace to the quarter
marker, lost position into the stretch and weakened in the final stages. MUAY THAI (IRE) chased the pace from the second flight, maintained a two wide
path to the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive, needed more in deep stretch and finished evenly. HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE took back off of the
contentious early pace and was allowed to settle, saved ground into the turn and improved position at the quarter pole, ran evenly to mid-stretch, offered a
mild late gain but was not able to make an impact. SMILIN EVIE prominent in the early stages, chased the contentious pace three wide into the turn,
maintained that three wide path into the stretch, was outkicked at the furlong marker and gave way in the late going.

Footnotes
BOLD MISTRESS came away well then was allowed to settle into stride, showed good speed but rated nicely in a tracking position three wide down the
backstretch, was asked to go on from the three furlong pole, gained the lead by the quarter, was set down at the top of the stretch, surged ahead and won
clear. TURA LURA broke well then settled mid-pack for the first quarter mile, took an inside path through the turn, tipped out a path for the stretch run,
responded when put to task and was gaining but could not reel in the winner. MARY MARGARET broke a step slow, veered outward and was slow to get
going at the start, was allowed to settle into stride well behind the field, made steady forward progress through the middle of the race as was in striking
distance of the lead passing the quarter pole, swung four wide and had clear run down the stretch, responded to steady handling and gained the third spot.
TONI TWO POCKET broke sharply, was sent for the lead and showed good speed and set the pace to the stretch, held the lead to the furlong marker and
gave way. AUSTRIAN NAVY broke well, raced four wide throughout went into a drive from the three-eighths pole and but unable to make an impact. DON'T
TELL HYDEE was bothered by SUPERSONIC FLYER at the break and was away last, chased the field to the turn, saving ground to along the rail, waited
for room passing the quarter pole but did not go on when clear. SUPERSONIC FLYER broke well but ceded the lead to TONI TWO POCKET, opted instead
to stalk from just behind, was sent after that rival passing the three furlong marker but could not make any headway and was spent from early efforts at the
head of the stretch.

Footnotes
SPEEDING STYLE asked for speed leaving the break, assumed command and dictated terms in the early stages, was well handled while setting moderate
fractions into the turn, kicked to a clear lead into upper stretch and was kept to task into the final sixteenth, was ridden out in the late stages and was much
the best. NUESTRO ENGREIDO forwardly placed early on, raced close up to the moderate pace and stalked SPEEDING STYLE two wide to the quarter
marker, was outkicked into the stretch and chased SPEEDING STYLE to the furlong marker, was no match for the winner in the final stages and was
second best. HARBOR SKY chased the moderate pace, raced three wide to the quarter marker and swung five wide into the stretch, was not able to impact
the top pair in the final furlong and ran on to be clear for third at the finish. STAND TO chased outside of rivals, improved position five wide at the quarter
pole, swung to the six path into the stretch and lacked the needed late response. KHAIKY'S COMMAND chased the early pace, lost position three wide
along the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. OUR EXPECTATION lacked early speed, improved position four wide at the quarter marker,
ran evenly to the furlong marker and did not threaten late. BRONZE ONE forwardly placed early, chased the moderate pace two wide into the turn, lost
ground at the quarter marker, tipped four wide for the stretch drive, could not keep pace at mid-stretch and gave way. SPROSTON hesitated at the start and
was off slowly, was unhurried while saving ground through the turn and did not factor. RALLY CAT tracked the early pace and saved ground into the turn,
mounted an inside rally into the stretch, could not sustain that run into the final stages and tired. CALI CONQUEST chased from the second flight, lost
ground two wide at the quarter marker, lacked a response in the drive and did not threaten. ARTHUR SPOONER broke alertly, chased the early pace from
the outside, raced four wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive and tired in the final furlong. BRANNIGAN rated off of the early pace, came
in tight while between rivals at the half-mile marker, remained on a hold to the three-furlong pole, chased three wide to the quarter marker and did not make
an impact in the stretch.

Footnotes
TIGER TOO was allowed to settle into stride, started to move forward towards the leaders passing the half mile marker, bid three wide and drew even at the
quarter pole, took command at the top of the stretch and responded to intermittent urging down the lane to prevail. RUNNING ON FIRE tracked from well off
the pace in the early going, went into a drive with three furlongs to run, continued the rally into the stretch, had a clear path and finished up willingly gain
second. WINNING LOVER broke sharply then backed off the pace duel, tried to re-engage on the turn, ran into traffic at the head of the stretch, responded
to steady handling when clear and gained third. DANZING REBEL was getting out and raced very wide down the backstretch, angled inward for the run
through the turn but was still five wide, launched a bid from the three-eighths pole and finished up well despite still having trouble running straight down the
stretch. EARTHLY TIGER was outrun in the early stages, chased the field to the turn, rallied inside into the turn, found best stride in the stretch and was
making up a lot of ground but was too late. PETER FLIES broke sharply and went to the lead under a tight hold, was joined by WHENTHEFOGLIFTS and
dueled with that one through fast fractions to the stretch, got the best of that rival in mid-stretch but was outfinished in the last furlong. TIGER ATTACK
tracked three wide for a quarter mile, came under a ride from the seven-sixteenth pole and lost ground and position through the turn kept to task in the
stretch but could do no better than chase the field to the wire. WHENTHEFOGLIFTS broke sharply, dueled outside of PETER FLIES from the break to the
stretch, started to weaken passing the three-sixteenth pole and faded down the lane. NOT MY RODEO broke slowly then rushed up to join the pack, saved
ground into the turn then struggled to keep pace past the three-furlong pole, did not go on and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
DRAW ME allowed to settle leaving the start, was unhurried through the early stages and raced two wide into the turn, made a mild advance at the quarter
pole then angled to the six path into upper stretch, was full of run approaching the furlong grounds, responded to urging and vied for the lead approaching
the sixteenth-marker, took command into deep stretch and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. ZAZEN away in good order, tracked the early pace then
advanced to race close up to the front heading to the turn, pressed the pace three wide to the quarter marker and shifted four wide into the stretch, vied for
the lead into upper stretch then took a narrow lead heading to the furlong grounds, battled with LADY'S SERMON to the sixteenth-pole, was overtaken by
DRAW ME in deep stretch and was bested by the winner in the final strides, while holding well for second at the finish. LADY'S SERMON forwardly placed
away from the start, chased the solid pace from the second flight and raced two wide into the turn, gained ground heading to the quarter marker then came
in tight and waited for racing room nearing the top of the stretch, found a seam in upper stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, battled with ZAZEN into
the final sixteenth, was outfinished in deep stretch and just missed for second, while holding clearly for third. MISS UNION broke out at the start and was
away a step slowly, chased the pace from the second flight and raced between rivals heading to the turn, was coaxed along three wide to the quarter pole,
tipped five wide for the drive and made a mild gain at the furlong marker, lacked the needed late response and was outkicked in deep stretch.
MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN unhurried away from the start, came in tight in the early stages and steadied at the eleven-sixteenths marker, settled while not far
back heading into the turn, saved ground to the quarter marker then angled four wide for the drive, rallied at mid-stretch, could not sustain that run into the
final furlong and passed a tired rival late. LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND forwardly placed in the early going, chased the solid pace between runners into the
turn and came four wide to the quarter marker, maintained that four wide path into the stretch and could not keep pace at the furlong marker, lacked a
response in deep stretch and passed tiring rivals in the final stages. THE GREAT HAYNES chased the solid early pace between runners, gained ground five
wide at the quarter pole, shifted seven wide into the stretch and did not threaten in the drive. CITY GLITTER broke alertly, chased the solid early pace from
the outside, raced six wide to the quarter marker, swung to the eight path into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong pole and did not factor late. DULCE
EMMA pulled on the rider and was prominent in the early going, engaged with YOUNG LIFE LAURA and pressed that rival through decent fractions heading
into the turn, dueled between runners to the quarter marker, battled into upper stretch, lost ground at the furlong pole and tired in the final stages. YOUNG
LIFE LAURA asked for speed leaving the break, assumed command and set solid early fractions, was engaged by DULCE EMMA into the turn and set a
pressured pace to the quarter pole, dropped back in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MOBOU got inside position on the first turn but opted to back off the pace heading to the backstretch, settled near the rear of the compact field saving all the
ground to the far turn, waited on the inside for a hole to open up then swung out about seven wide into the stretch, was set down and responded with a bold
rally down the center of the track, pulled clear passing the sixteenth pole and held to the wire. A MAN'S MAN was off a step slowly, rated near the back of
the back for the first half mile, got a bit closer heading into the turn then launched a sustained rally five wide through the far turn, carried that momentum into
the stretch run and ran on well to pass all but the winner. HEAT N REHEAT raced in the middle of the pack under some restraint, became boxed in on the
far turn, then stuck behind a wall of horses and checked off heels at the three-sixteenth pole, squeezed through a narrow opening between horses near the
furlong marker and ran on well to gain the third position. BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) was always close up racing on the inside, waited for room on the far turn,
found room up the rail turning for home, responded to strong handling but came up short. DULAS (IRE) went five wide into the clubhouse turn, remained out
in the clear for the backstretch run, made a wide rally into contention on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch was still with a chance approaching the
eighth pole then was outfinished to the wire. FALSELY ACCUSED got caught four wide early, raced mid-pack and made steady forward progress down the
backstretch, bid for the lead approaching the five-sixteenths marker, was in the middle of the five horse fan across the track at the three-sixteenths pole,
was unable to find another gear when needed but finished evenly. HARMON was a little slow into stride and trailed the field into the first turn, dropped
further behind through the far turn then made a sustained run from the five-sixteenths, loomed a threat approaching the furlong pole, lacked room at the
sixteenth and got clear too late to make an impact. MR. T'S THIRSTY came away well and was between horses contesting the lead going into the first turn,
stalked THE CALABRESE KID to the half, then took a short lead with SUPERMAZEL pressing to the outside, was inside of a quartet battling for the lead at
the top of the stretch, held on mid-stretch then gave way in the final furlong. SUPERMAZEL was hustled from the outside but got caught three wide around
the first bend, was stalking close up to the half mile pole then moved to challenge for the lead through the turn, came into the stretch two deep of five horses
across the track, but had nothing to offer for the stretch run and faded. THE CALABRESE KID broke smartly and was sent for the lead, held sway to the far
turn then struggled to fend off a host of challengers passing the three furlong marker, steadied hard just before the quarter pole, lost momentum and was
unable to recover.

Footnotes
SIGNORINA MERISI (GB) took back to track the decent early pace, tracked between runners heading to the half-mile marker and improved position two
wide into the far turn, tipped four wide into the stretch, responded to urging and gained ground at the furlong marker, closed determinedly into the final
sixteenth, wore down ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA in deep stretch and edged away to prevail. ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA tracked the decent early pace, was
well placed through the backstretch run and was coaxed along three wide into the far turn, advanced to vie for the lead approaching the quarter pole and
took command into upper stretch, kept to task and showed the way to the furlong marker, was confronted by SIGNORINA MERISI nearing the
sixteenth-marker, could not hold off the oncoming winner in deep stretch and was outfinished, while besting the rest. LADYWEARSTHERING forwardly
placed in the early going, stalked the pacesetter two wide along the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and attended to the decent pace heading to
the half-mile marker, vied for the lead between runners at the quarter pole, battled into the stretch and drifted in a path leaving the three-sixteenths marker,
chased ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA to mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and just held for third at the finish. STOIC LUNA allowed to settle,
raced two wide along the first turn and tracked the decent pace to the half-mile marker, gained ground into the second turn and was roused two then three
wide at the quarter pole, swung to the five path into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, showed good late interest in the final sixteenth and
just missed for third at the wire. CALLHERCONTESSA hustled from her outside post leaving the start, cleared the field into the first turn and dictated terms
into the backstretch run, set decent fractions to the half-mile marker, came under pressure heading to the quarter pole and was overtaken into upper stretch,
steadied off of heels when LADYWEARSTHERING came in leaving the three-sixteenths marker, chased to the furlong grounds and faded in the final
stages. ARINA (GER) unhurried in the early going, saved ground along the first turn and settled off of the decent pace through the backstretch run, saved all
of the ground into the second turn, advanced at the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive, needed more in the final stages and finished evenly. BOLD
DAUGHTER fractious in the starting gate, was allowed to settle and came two wide into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, raced
outside of rivals into the far turn and mounted a four wide bid at the quarter marker, swung to the six path into upper stretch, finished evenly in the drive and
lacked a late response. MADEIRA WINE broke alertly, conceded the early lead and tracked outside of runners in the early going, raced three wide along the
first turn and tracked from the outside into the backstretch run, gained ground at the half-mile marker, made a steady advance three then four wide
approaching the quarter pole, lost ground into the stretch and weakened in the late stages. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY allowed to settle away from the start,
saved ground into the first turn, tracked the decent pace while saving ground through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the far turn and
offered an inside bid at the quarter marker, could not sustain that run into the stretch and gave way.

GRACEFUL MISCHIEF unhurried leaving the break, settled two wide into the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run and maintained a two
wide path into the far turn, waited for racing room at the quarter marker and tipped four wide for the drive, split rivals into upper stretch and loomed at the
furlong marker, dove to the inside, responded to urging and drew to even terms with DAZZLE THE COMMAND at the sixteenth-marker, battled with that
game rival into deep stretch, took a narrow lead in the final strides and held for the win at the wire. DAZZLE THE COMMAND settled while not far back in
the early going, raced two wide into the backstretch run and improved position at the half-mile marker, continued his gain three wide at the quarter pole,
angled seven wide into the stretch, rallied and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, took command and was confronted by GRACEFUL MISCHIEF
approaching the sixteenth-pole, battled gamely into deep stretch and was bested in the final strides, while holding clearly at the finish for second. BOOMING
BERNARDO allowed to settle early on, saved ground into the first turn and advanced into the backstretch run, was well placed while between runners
heading to the half-mile marker, continued his advance two wide at the quarter marker, shifted to the five path into upper stretch and loomed at the furlong
grounds, was outkicked by the top pair in the final sixteenth and held clearly in the end for third. HERON BAY lacked early speed and was far behind in the
early going, regained contact with the field near the three furlong marker, circled the field to mount an eight wide bid in the stretch, could not sustain that run
into the late stages and flattened out. PASS THE BATON forwardly placed away from the start, saved ground into the first turn and tracked the decent pace
into the backstretch run, made a steady advance while saving ground and came within aim at the quarter marker, came in tight and waited for racing room
nearing the top of the stretch, shifted paths in upper stretch and shut off DANZING ALYDAR inside of the three-sixteenths marker, lost position at the furlong
pole and weakened in the final stages. DONTIM settled three wide into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, slipped to the rail and saved
ground into the far turn, waited for racing room nearing the top of the stretch, tipped two wide for the drive and did not threaten in the late stages. DEO
prominent leaving the start and disputed the decent early with DANZING ALYDAR, contested solid fractions with that runner approaching the half-mile pole
and dueled into the far turn, lost position into upper stretch, put PASS THE BATON in tight at the three-sixteenths marker which in turn caused DANZING
ALYDAR to clip heels, could not keep pace at the furlong marker and faded in deep stretch. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE forwardly placed early on, stalked the
decent pace two wide into the backstretch run, raced close up to the pace heading to the half-mile marker, chased four wide into the second turn, angled six
wide for the drive, lost ground at the furlong marker and tired in the late stages. THE FUSS broke slowly then rushed three wide around the first turn to join
the leaders just past the six furlong pole, launched a bid near the seven-sixteenths pole but was blocked by a wall of horses at the quarter marker, could not
keep pace into the drive and was not persevered with to the wire. DANZING ALYDAR hustled to the lead then pulled hard with the rider doing his best to
temper the pace, was joined on the backstretch run by a pair to the outside, and was let loose to regain the lead and set the pace to the turn, was overtaken
into upper stretch, came in tight, clipped heels and fell inside of the three-sixteenths marker and was vanned off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN UPPER STRETCH INVOLVING DANZING ALYDAR CLIPPING HEELS. THE STEWARDS RULED THAT DEO PUT
PASS THE BATON IN TIGHT IN UPPER STRETCH, WHICH IN TURN CAUSED DANZING ALYDAR TO CLIP HEELS AND FALL. DEO WAS
DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED UNPLACED.
