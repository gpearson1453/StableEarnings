Footnotes
STOP GIGGLING set the early pace from the inside, well handled on the turn while racing towards the inside, was in the two path off the turn and roused
nearing the furlong marker and drew off smartly to prove much the best. GRACEFUL was well placed on the inside, saved ground on the turn, shifted off the
inside leaving the three sixteenths and finished willingly but was no match for the winner, second best. BELLE OF THE BALL chased the early pace from
the outside, four wide on the turn, then improved position but needed more, bested the rest. DRAMATIC EFFECT chased the early pace between rivals
three wide, then dropped towards the inside on the turn, angled out in the lane and had no rally. CHIARA was away alertly to stalked the winner three wide,
loomed nearing the quarter pole but came up empty in the drive. AVALANCHE IS COMIN broke in at the start, raced on the inside entering the turn, then
wax roused by the three eighths marker and was two to three wide on the turn while being no threat.

Footnotes
AULA was coaxed from the gate, went around the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked late on the backstretch, chased in
the two path on the far turn, gained three wide into the stretch then drew even with the pacesetter, took the advantage before the furlong marker, led under
a drive into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. GRANDPA'S KID saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was ridden along in the
two path on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, rallied outside in the drive and closed strongly but was too late while up for the place.
MASTERWORK broke out then was hustled to the front, dropped in to save ground on the first turn, showed the way in hand with a clear advantage, was let
out some late on the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path, lost the advantage
near the eighth-pole, fought on well to the finish but missed while well clear for the show. STJAMES broke a step slow, saved ground on the first turn,
settled at the rear, was urged along while moving from the rail to the two path on the far turn and failed to threaten. MEMPHIS went two to three wide on the
turns and was no factor. GOLDEN PURCHASE traveled three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged three then four wide on the far turn,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. ANTHRACITE was well placed on the inside, dropped back on the backstretch, saved ground on the
far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
NOVA RAGS was well rated two wide behind the three front runners, swung out four wide leaving the turn, then tipped out five wide for aim leaving the three
sixteenths, made a bid and hit the front nearing the sixteenth marker and slowly edged clear to prove best under a drive. BABY YODA pressed the early
pace three wide, then vied for command between rivals by the five sixteenth, made a bid by the quarter pole to gain a short advantage leaving the turn, then
ran on well but was out-kicked by his stablemate. BEACHWALKER was reserved early, three wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane and angled out
late for racing room and finished well to gain the show award. SPUN AND WON stalked the early pace from the outside, made a four wide bid on the turn to
vie for command, then drifted in slightly nearing the furlong marker, then was corrected with a left handed crop while flattening out. B DAWK was allowed to
settle early, saved ground on the turn, swung wide leaving the turn and had no rally. BOURBON MUSIC rushed up the inside to set a pressured pace early,
then vied for the lead on the inside on the turn and gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
VOLEUSE was urged along on the outside, went four wide early on the turn then angled to the two path, made her way to the rail near the three-eighths
pole, gained passing the five-sixteenths, cut the corner through a rail opening into the stretch then made a bid, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, shook
clear into the final furlong, drifted out some under a left-handed crop near the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under steady urging. ACCELERINA came away
in good order, was well placed just off the pace, chased while moving from the rail to the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch,
pursued the winner in the drive, swapped back to her inside lead near the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while just able to get the place. MALU brushed
with a foe at the start, was coaxed early then came under stronger encouragement late on the backstretch, gained three then four wide on the turn, was
driven six wide into the stretch, pursued the winner while outside in the drive and just missed the place while clear for the show. MONTAUK MYSTIQUE
settled on the outside, was asked three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. MO DAMORNINGGROUCH was away alertly
then showed clear early, set the pace, vied inside on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, lost the advantage at the three-sixteenths and gave
way. UNHOLY was urged along at the rear, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. SASSY TALLAHASSEE brushed with a rival at the
start, was urged along near the back, saved ground on the turn, came out into the stretch and faltered then was eased but walked off. ESSENTIAL LIFE

Footnotes
ELYSIAN MEADOWS prompted the early pace three wide, then was between rivals on the turn, made a three wide bid off the turn and kicked clear by the
furlong marker, then held off MISCHIEF JOKE well to prove best. MISCHIEF JOKE was well rated two to three wide, tipped out five wide leaving the turn
and finished well but could not get to the winner, clearly second best. ALWAYS A WARRIOR was well rated on the inside, saved ground on the turn, cut the
corner leaving the turn, angled out and finished willingly to gain the show award. DETECTIVE TOM was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, then vied
for the lead on the turn while racing towards the inside, dug in by the furlong marker but weakened late losing the show award. SLAMMIN GOLD was off
slowly and bumped a foe, then rushed up on the outside, made a four wide bid on the turn to vie for command on the outside, but flattened out in the drive.
AGGELOS THE GREAT was reserved early, three to four wide on the turn, swung out eight wide leaving the turn and had no rally. PERLIANO chased the
pace three to four wide and weakened. RUNNING LUCKY was settled early and lacked a rally. TAPORICAL was off a step slow and bumped at the start,
then was far back early and was not a factor. ICE THE KICKER was settled early, came wide into the lane and was not a threat.

Footnotes
CLOVER STREET broke out then was hustled, raced towards the back under urging, went four then five wide on the turn, rallied seven wide into the stretch,
closed strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with the runner-up to the finish and narrowly prevailed. BETTER HUMOR ME raced
towards the front, was carried out some near the five-eighths pole, chased five wide on the turn, rallied to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with
the winner to the finish and just missed while clear for the place. REIGNING CHICK was urged along on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn and
improved for the show. BERN ROSEY BERN showed speed then chased the pace, made a bid at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the three path on the turn,
drifted out some while battling for the lead in mid-stretch and tired. LAVON dropped back after breaking well, fell well off the pace, angled from three to six
wide on the turn, came eight wide into the stretch, reached a reasonable striking range before the furlong marker but flattened out. DASHING DELLA moved
up under urging after breaking at the rear, was bumped nearing the five-eighths and forced out, made a bid in the four path on the turn, battled under a drive
into the final furlong and weakened. FANCY FELINE dropped back after breaking well, went two then three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten. JACKSON AVENUE lost her footing some at the start, was urged along on the outside, went five then six wide on the turn and lacked
the needed response. FREDDYMO FACTOR was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out twice in the
stretch and was no factor. SUPERS LUCKY LADY was hustled from the gate, angled in while going to the front, went around the turn in the two path, lost
the advantage under urging near the five-sixteenths and capitulated. LONGLIVE THE QUEEN came out near the five-eighths then bumped with a foe, went
two to three wide on the turn, dropped back four wide into the stretch and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.
