Footnotes
LLORONA vied three deep to the turn, cleared inner rival and crossed over on the turn, coaxed along at the quarter pole, then drew off under moderate
hand urging and coasted in late. MAKE IT SNOW settled inside, angled four wide around the turn and bested the rest. SULTRY KITTEN vied for the lead
inside a pair of rivals, dueled early on the turn before losing touch with the winner approaching the five-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the lane and
flattened. DANCING MO broke inward then started to climb and dropped back from inside, angled out around the bend and trailed four wide into the lane,
then showed a mild response to pass tired rivals. SIDE BY SIDE vied between rivals to the turn, could not keep up and chased after the top pair around the
bend, spun five wide into the lane and weakened. MONIQUE broke a step slow, chased two wide then angled over to the inside on the turn and failed to
menace. CUTE KHLOE chased four wide into the turn, exited the bend five to six wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
SOMEONE LIKE YOU sprinted clear early, set all the pace from inside to the stretch, remained unchallenged to midstretch, confronted by rivals in the final
sixteenth and lasted. QUICK KATE broke a step slow, angled to the inside racing well off the pace, saved ground through the turn, ran into minor traffic at
the eighth pole, angled out into the clear, surged late and missed three deep on the line. SAFA chased between early then outside a rival, continued two
wide into the lane, chased the leader into deep stretch, then put in a late bid and missed between rivals. MISS MICHE LADA coaxed from the gate, chased
from inside, looked to tip out but got hemmed in by SAFA in upper stretch, gained an opening when SOMEONE LIKE YOU came off the fence, finished
gamely but was outkicked. WILD RULER broke a step slow, tracked from inside into the turn, angled out into the lane, got floated out near the sixteenth pole
and finished willingly. CANDY KENDALL broke a step slow and dropped back early, trailed two wide into the turn then angled over to the rail, traveled a bit
off the fence into the lane and produced a mild rally to whittle the gap late. LANESRA tracked two wide outside a rival into the turn, advanced between
through the bend, angled out into the stretch, floated out at the sixteenth pole and lacked a rally. PEPPERTINI chased four deep or four wide to the stretch
and weakened. EASTER COMING BACK forwardly placed three deep to the turn, lost ground around the bend and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MEDORO coaxed from the gate but got put in tight by outer rival early, chased along the rail to the turn, got boxed in around the bend, remained on the
fence, rallied up the inside then tipped out with a sixteenth left to run, flew late and nailed GIRL OF MY DREAMS near the wire. GIRL OF MY DREAMS
stepped to the front early, showed the way along the inside through the turn, put to right handed urging midstretch, led clear into deep stretch, then was run
down by the winner in the closing moments. SPIRIT RULES showed early speed then chased the pacesetter two wide into the turn, raced a bit off the rail
into the lane, lacked a late bid but churned on to save the show. HOT HOT HOT tracked from inside, moved out in upper stretch and weakened. ONE
SUMMER DAY broke a step slow and brushed with outer rival, got bumped from inside shortly after, chased five deep at the quarter pole and lacked a rally.
GERWIG dropped back early, trailed off the inside, angled to the rail on the turn, steered back out into the lane and improved position. GLO GLO brushed
with inner rival at the start, tracked four deep and got brushed again up the backstretch, continued outside rivals through the turn and failed to respond when
called upon. BLISSTERINTHESUN stalked outside a rival into the turn, spun three wide into the lane and faded. STORMY GAL bumped leaving the gate,
chased three deep between rivals then got bumped and put in tight early, continued three deep then outside a rival into the lane and weakened. WE'LL DO
IT LIVE bumped at the start, chased between rivals and bumped with STORMY GAL early, continued between rivals in the two path into the turn and
weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
ZOMBO BOMBO vied four deep up the backstretch, dueled outside a rival three wide into the turn, cleared and shifted into the two path and remained
unchallenged through the lane under a strong drive. JUST STEP ON IT raced up close between then chased outside a rival into the turn, rounded the bend
two then three wide and finished willingly for a clear second. WINNING BIG broke out slightly, climbed a bit early, chased three wide into the turn, moved
into the two path then angled five wide into the lane and was along for the show. NAUKANAUKA came away a few lengths slow, climbed a bit and raced
greenly up the backstretch, chased two wide into the turn, made some progress while angling to the inside, steered back out into the drive and lacked a rally
in the final furlong. GRAZEN BOY tracked four wide leaving the backstretch, drifted out while fighting the rider on the turn and weakened in the lane.
THIRSTY LOV vied for the lead inside rivals up the backstretch, chased along the rail then two wide on the turn and weakened. SUNSET STORM vied three
deep for the lead, dueled from inside to the five-sixteenths pole, chased after the winner approaching the quarter pole and gave way. RENNIEGADE BROS

Footnotes
STAY AND SCAM stalked outside a rival, drew closer in the two path on the turn, tipped outside the top pair into the stretch, quickly took over and clear with
a furlong remaining and powered away in deep stretch. GEM MINE chased along the rail into and around the bend, stayed on the fence in the drive, lacked
room behind the leaders briefly in upper stretch before gaining a clear run along the fence and got up for second. HAYLEY LEVADE traveled along the
inside towards the rear into the turn, angled out and summoned a mild rally and got up for the show. DENIM IN GOLD sent from inside and dueled for
command up the backstretch, battled around the turn and into the lane, could not kick on with the new leader outside the eighth pole and flattened between
rivals to lose the place and show. READY JET GO settled along the inside, moved out in the lane and kept on to share a minor award. TEEN DRAMA
settled off the rail then outside a rival, remained two wide around the bend, asked right handed leaving the turn, steered out in upper stretch and failed to
menace. REAL FIRE sat off the rail near the back, rounded the bend two then three wide, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked further response. RED
DIAMOND broke a step slow, saved ground through the turn and was never a factor. ORGANIC dueled for command outside DENIM IN GOLD, fought two
wide through the turn and into the lane, then gave way in the final furlong. BYE BYE MISS PIE broke out, traveled three deep at the back into the turn,
trailed two wide into the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
VULIN chased two wide then along the rail on the first turn, waited for an opening behind the wall of leaders on the far turn, gained a clear path and was
given her cue past the quarter pole, snuck through on the fence leaving the bend, took over in upper stretch and edged away from DE JORIA late. DE
JORIA unhurried early and moved into the two path then along the rail, moved closer still trailing in the middle stages on the inside, swung out at the quarter
pole and came six wide into the stretch, challenged VULIN from the middle part of the track with a furlong remaining, drifted inward and was turned away in
deep stretch. MISS KALINE brushed with inner rival at the start, chased six then five wide on the clubhouse turn, drew closer four deep on the backstretch,
fought outside a trio of rivals and put nose in front at the quarter pole, overtaken by VULIN at the top of the lane and flattened to third. ILA VEIW TOO had
early speed from the three path into the first turn then moved into two path and ceded command approaching the quarter pole, chased outside a rival into
the second bend, angled five wide at the quarter pole and flattened down the stretch. ZZYZX stumbled and brushed with MISS KALINE at the start, coaxed
along to a forward position five then four wide, challenged three deep between rivals on the far turn and weakened in the lane. VIOLET STORM coaxed
from the gate, chased along the rail then took over on the clubhouse turn, cleared early on the backstretch, pressured from outside near the half-mile pole,
vied with outer rivals on the far turn, lost command at the quarter pole, then gave way in the lane. ROPERS N WRANGLERS raced up close four to three
wide, lost touch with the leader for a bit then moved forward to apply pressure on the backstretch, fought between rivals on the far turn, got put in tight past
the quarter pole and tired in the stretch. MIDNIGHT SILENCE tracked three then two wide on the first turn, three deep on the backstretch, trailed three wide
into the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
STOLEN TREASURE cleared from the far outside and angled to the rail, remained unchallenged around the second bend, urged right handed into the lane,
switch to the left handed in upper stretch and drew away under strong handling. KITZKATY tracked two then was moved out to the three path on the first
turn by inner rival, rounded the far turn also two then three wide, moved out in the lane and edged KISS FOR LULU for the place honors. KISS FOR LULU
chased along the rail then became rank on the first turn and shifted to the two path, settled along the inside in the middle stages, saved ground to the
stretch, finished willingly but got outkicked for second. DRIVE FOR SHOW broke a step slow, tucked inside at the back, went between rivals into the
backstretch, angled five wide into the lane and summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. TAKES THREE traveled two wide into the clubhouse turn
then moved inside, raced in mid-pack in the middle stages, angled four wide into the lane and churned on to improve position. FLEET BROTATO settled off
the pace and moved into the two path, shifted to the rail on the backstretch, spun two wide into the lane and lacked room in traffic the final sixteenth.
GANTRY away quickly, forwardly placed while keen early and ran up on the heels of the leader on the clubhouse turn, stalked from inside up the
backstretch, tipped out in upper stretch and weakened. HIGH KING saved ground near back, continued on the inside into the lane and failed to menace.
CODY BOY traveled two wide near the back, chased three deep on the backstretch then outside a rival, trailed two wide into the lane and was not a factor.
LIGHT DRAGOON rank early when trying to rate three then two wide, coaxed along and asked right handed two wide in to the stretch and retreated in the
lane.
