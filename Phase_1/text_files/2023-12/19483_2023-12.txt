Footnotes
LOYAL TO THE CHIEF vied two wide, showed the way in the two path around the turn, drew off once set down in upper stretch and widened under a drive
while hanging on his left lead. SUM CHARM stalked three wide, inched closer to press the leader from the three path at the five sixteenths pole, but quickly
failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch and held place thereafter. JUST ANOTHER WIN leaned in and brushed a rival at the start, tracked in the
two path, pursued between horses turning for home, then held show from an outer rival through the lane. DANAS MULE laid off of the pace in the four path,
gained ground turning for home, but leveled off in upper stretch and was kept at bay for a minor placing. ROSIE SPRIT was outrun. CONTINENTAL RED
took light contact from an outer rival at the start, vied inside of the eventual winner early on, chased that one into the turn and faded entering the lane.

Footnotes
BIG SCULLY pressed the leader from the three path, bid turning for home, led entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch, held sway from an outer
pursuer through midstretch, but was collared by that one in the final sixteenth yet lasted via a head-bob. RISKY PRIORITY took contact from an outer rival
at the start, was hustled to track along the inside into the turn, shifted off the fence entering the lane, brushed an outer foe at the three sixteenths while
commencing a rally, took aim on the clear leader in the final furlong, sustained progress to offer a late bid but missed the nod at the wire. FIELD OF VISION
bumped an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, then stayed on to gain show from an outer rival approaching the sixteenth pole. ONE
TOUGH CHARLIE stalked the top pair from the four to five path, but was brushed by an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole and gave way.
ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE laid off of the pace in the five to six path and moved up late. INTHEALY set the pace inside of a pressing rival while a path off the
inside around the turn, but was headed entering the lane and faded. CUSTOM PRAYER raced off of the pace in the four path and between horses, then
made little impact. THE THREE KS trailed early on, steadied behind foes into the turn and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
IT WASN'T ME tracked two to three wide around the first turn, chased under urging two wide around the far turn, shifted out to the five path while hanging
on her left lead in upper stretch, changed over at the three sixteenths pole sparking progress to bid at the furlong grounds, forged an advantage leaving that
station and held sway as her inner counterparts fought on. SILENT SECRETARY (BRZ) brushed with an inner rival at the start, stalked along the inside, bid
in the three path in upper stretch, vied as an outer rival joined the fray at the furlong grounds, but was headed by that one leaving that marker, fought on
gamely thereafter but failed to regain even terms. IM SINGLED UP hopped and broke slowly, saved ground off of the pace, gained ground entering the lane,
sustained a rail challenge in midstretch but needed more in the final furlong. CAPELLA RED broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, lacked speed
two wide, fanned from the four to six path entering the lane and ran on mildly. TRES CHIC (ARG) transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at
the start, trailed along the inside, moved out of last in the three path around the far turn, ran on thereafter but failed to menace. TURBO PROP brushed with
an outer rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, but was headed between bidders at the furlong grounds and faded. MARMO MOON laid off of the
pace three to four wide before retreating in the five path around the far turn. WINE IN THE DARK was bumped by an inner rival at the start, pressed three to
two wide around the first turn, required urging to sustain pressure around the far turn, but weakened in the four path and between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
PLAY GOOD PAY GOOD set a fast pace in the two path as an outer rival applied moderate pressure, met that one's challenge turning for home, yet
repelled that challenge in upper stretch and drove clear. AZTEC EMPRESS brushed with an outer rival at the start, pressed the leader from the three path,
bid approaching the lane, but was turned away in upper stretch, yielded through the final furlong yet saved place at the wire. LADY ABERDEEN brushed
with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, tipped to the six path in upper stretch, ran on to offer a late place bid but missed.
COFFEE CRISP veered outwardly at the start, tracked the top pair from the four path, but chased in the five path entering the lane and lacked a bid. FROST
AND FIRE broke a step slow, tracked in the two path around the turn and tired. LOLA'S LIGHT saved ground well back but to no avail. MAYLEN was slow
early on and showed litlte.

Footnotes
PORT TOWNSEND took contact from an inner rival at the start, vied two wide, led along the inside into the turn, met an outer pair of bids at the five
sixteenths pole, yet shook free when let out a notch in upper stretch and drew off under mild urging. TRULY GRATEFUL settled off of the pace along the
inside, split foes in the five path in upper stretch and rallied to prove second best. CANDY BAR broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, lacked early
speed, gained in the four path and outside of foes turning for home before fanning to the eight path in upper stretch, stayed on to gain show at the sixteenth
pole and held from an outer bidder. LIFFEY bumped with an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace in the three path, entered the lane in the six path
behind a foe, tipped to the eight path for clear sailing outside of foes entering the final furlong and ran on willingly. FIESTA BESTA vied along the inside
early on, stalked from the pocket into the turn, shifted outwardly behind foes in upper stretch, entered the final furlong in the five path and among foes and
ran on mildly. CLASSIC CLAIRE bumped with an outer rival upon leaving the gates, tracked in the two to three path, drifted out to the six path in upper
stretch and yielded between horses. FIRST LOVE bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked four wide, bid three wide turning for home, but failed to
keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, sustained a chase soon after but faded between horses through the final furlong. MYSTIC CREED stalked three
wide, bid two wide along with an outer rival turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leader entering the lane and tired through the final furlong.
THEMISCHIEVOUSONE bumped with an inner rival at the start and was outrun throughout.

horses into the turn, vied along with an outer counterpart turning for home, sparred between rivals through midstretch but yielded late. DEN'S GOOD
GRACE broke slowly, chased along the inside, shifted to the three path in upper stretch and ran on. KINGSCOTE laid off of the pace in the five path and
sustained stride to stay on through the lane. PHILANTHROPER stalked along the inside, produced an early bid for the lead in order to secure inside position

faltered between rivals when the leader cut across his path into the turn and was outrun thereafter. FLY'N FRISBEE hopped slightly and steadied from
crowded quarters at the start, pursued two wide and between horses, but retreated to trail in the six path turning for home and was done early. A

Footnotes
SOUL COAXING stalked in the two path, moved forward along with an outer rival to press outside of the leader and from the three path at the half mile pole,
sustained pressure around the far turn, bid entering the lane, forged an advantage in upper stretch and drove clear. FREEDOM FACTOR prompted two
wide, led with five furlongs to go, showed the way in the two path as an outer rival pressed around the far turn, but was bested by that one at the three
sixteenths pole, kept on through midstretch and held place. HALEYS SAILOR tracked in the three path, chased shifting to the four path entering upper
stretch and ran on willingly. SNIVELING trailed along the inside then stayed on between horses. MALTHAEL brushed the gate and was off a step slow, laid
off of the pace along the inside, moved to the three path around the far turn before drifting to the six path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. TELEPHONE
TALKER tracked along the inside, shifted out entering the backstretch, inched closer four wide and outside of the leaders with nine sixteenths to go, but only
managed to chase the leading pair from the two path around the far turn and gave way. MOUNTAIN PINE set the pace along the inside, but was headed by
an outer counterpart with five furlongs to go and weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
CRAFTED set a clear pace, maintained an open margin through midstretch while hanging on his left lead, tired in the final sixteenth and lasted from a late
outer bidder to the wire. TRUST ISSUES leaned out and bumped an outer foe at the start, tracked along the inside, took aim outside of the clear leader
nearing the lane, only managed to chase that one through midstretch, yet sustained stride to close in as the leader tired in the final sixteenth, attempted a
late bid but ran out of ground. B FIFTY TWO laid off of the pace in the three path, then stayed on between horses to forge show late. STARSTUDDED
AFFAIR chased two wide, but drifted to the five path entering the lane, yet ran on evenly through the final furlong. ROCK N ROLL BOLT bumped with an
inner rival at the start, tracked in the three to two path entering the lane and sustained rail chase. SABI broke slowly, lacked speed along the inside and
failed to threaten. VINCITA raced at the rear two wide and between horses then never got involved. SNOW KING trailed three wide and was outrun.
COOKN WIT CATMAN tracked in the three to four path into the turn, but faded with three furlongs to go.

WAY TO BE MARIE tracked two wide, ranged up in the four path around the far turn, bid in the five path in upper stretch, dueled with an inner bidding
counterpart through the final furlong and edged ahead late. WITHOUT CAUSE stalked in the three to two path, bid inside of the drifting leader in upper
stretch, sparred with an outer co-bidder through midstretch but was bested. RAGTIME LADY settled off of the pace along the inside, then in the two path
around the far turn, swung out to the six path entering upper stretch and rallied to gain show at the sixteenth pole. CORA'S LEGACY set the pace in the two
path, built a clear margin down the backstretch, but drifted to the four path at the quarter pole while meeting a challenge from a rival on either side, was
bested between horses in upper stretch, yielded and lost show at the sixteenth marker. JOYFUL IMAGE raced at the rear along the inside, shifted out in
upper stretch and moved up between horses in the final furlong. PURR FACTOR pursued from midpack in the three path and failed to menace. NOT
TONIGHT JOE broke in and bumped a rival at the start, tracked along the inside, chased from the two path around the far turn, shifted to the three path
entering the lane and lacked a rally between horses. STILL TEMPER pursued from midpack in the two path, was urged along the inside around the far turn
and failed to factor. MISS HARMONIC was bumped by an outer rival at the start, settled off of the pace two wide, fanned from the three path to the seven
path entering the lane and made little impac. MS SEDONA broke slowly and was outrun two wide. TEMPTING LADY stalked along the inside, tipped off the
fence entering the lane and weakened between horses.

Footnotes
FOURALIVIA set the pace in the two path, cleared entering the lane and held sway from an outer pursuer. CAJUN NINJA stalked close up along the inside,
took aim in the three path entering the lane, then chased the clear leader home to prove second best. LOUISIANA LIBERTY laid off of the pace in the two
path, swung to the five path entering the lane and chased to edge show at the furlong grounds. SHES A LUCKY REBEL pressed the leader from the three
path, but faded in the four path at the quarter pole. HOPEITSMYLUCKYDAY took the turn in the four path while off of the pace and failed to menace.
LUMINOUS FLIGHT chased the leading trio from the three path and multiple lengths off into the turn, but faded around the bend. SHELLI'S ANGEL broke a
step slow and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ZAICI prompted outside of the leader, vied around the far turn, led in the four path entering the lane, maintained a margin from his inner game counterpart
into the final sixteenth and edged clear laet. HOODLUM stalked in the three path, took aim in the fie path entering the lane, lacked progress through
midstretch, but sustained a chase to produce a late bid for place and gained that position at the wire. CONRADO set the pace inside of the eventual winner
while in the two path, got headed entering the lane, fought on through midstretch, but yielded in the final sixteenth and was nailed at the wire for place.
ROOSTER RUN laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, ran on and leveled off. ONE MORE BABY tracked in the two
path and pursued one paced. BELLA'S GATSBY failed to factor. FATHER PATRICK made little impact along the inside. KEESAWAH tracked along the
inside around the first turn but steadily faded thereafter. F J'S GEM lacked speed in the three path and made little impact. HEY JACKSON broke slowly,
raced off of the pace in the four path and weakened. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY lacked speed in the six path and was outrun.
