Footnotes
MUD BUG was bumped leaving the gate then settled off the pace about the three path, started a bid leaving the half mile pole and took over two deep at the
quarter, raced clear midway on the far turn and was steadily urged to hold on. HE'S ON FIRE rounded the first turn in the five path, started a bid toward the
seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn then dueled through the stretch and finished well to take second. DAD'S LIL SPARK rated the
pace inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, was met at the quarter, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and was
outfinished in the stretch duel for second. AKINGISALWAYSKING rated close inside for a half mile, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole then
angled to the five path approaching the far turn and finished evenly toward the outside. CHROME HEIR was shut off at the break and dropped well back
from early contention, raced outside into the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the seven path and passed some rivals widest. STAVANGER was
never a factor. CABAR SUL stumbled inward and made contact with Mud Bug leaving the gate then stalked from the seven eighths pole, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail into the far turn.

Footnotes
DASHING LASS raced off the pace in the five path the opening turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and raced close in the three path on
the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and got up the final yards. SUPER MONEY stalked two deep then took the nod approaching the five sixteenths pole,
drew clear toward the quarter and raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn but was caught in the final yards. NELLY TOO was bumped
outward and into Gazalani into the first turn then saved ground through the turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and steadily improved
from that point, rounded the far turn about the four path and finished well. SK'S HEART settled close off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little in the lane. PRINCESS MIA ROSE angled in and rated the early pace inside, came
under pressure leaving the three eighths pole but was met approaching the five sixteenths pole, dropped back at the rail approaching the quarter pole and
weakened on the far turn. RED RIVER SUSI rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole but weakened off the
rail on the far turn. VIESTE rated close inside on the first turn then faded through the backstretch. LOCKDOWN VANNA raced off the rail into the first turn,
left the turn outside and showed little response. GAZALANI was forced outward into the first turn, never factored and was eased. HEY MACARENA drifted
outward and into Nelly Too into the first turn, was not a factor and was eased.

but dug in under steady handling and drew away later yards. BRION contested a pressured pace two deep but dropped back toward the quarter pole, raced
at the rail on the turn and remained a close factor through the upper stretch before relenting. TAPIO chased outside, rounded the turn in the four and five
paths and dug in to take third the final strides. HUEY DUEY pressured the pace three wide down the backstretch, raced close in the three path on the turn
but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. SWEET SYNTAX engaged in close chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path
and finished evenly. DANCIN IN DUBAI ducked out at the break causing his rider to lose an iron, recovered past the quarter, raced at the rail on the turn
and finished evenly inside. ADIOS SEE YA gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail and weakened in the lane. T VILLE gave chase through the
backstretch, raced in the five path on the turn and showed little in the lane. VICTORIOUS BEAR gave chase then weakened in the three path on the turn.
