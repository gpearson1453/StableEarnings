Footnotes
MAGIC CASTLE dropped his rider stepping onto the track, vied two wide, led turning for home, drew clear entering the lane and was driven home, then
dislodged from his rider once again post race. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE tracked along the inside, shifted to the three path and between horses entering the
lane, gained place at the three sixteenths pole and was second best. CRYPTOZONIC trailed in the three path, then stayed on between horses to gain show
at the sixteenth pole. MOTION TO STRIKE chased two wide and between horses, failed to sustain position in the three path at the three furlong pole, shifted
to the four path entering the lane and ran on between foes. OPTIMAL COURAGE was fractious in the starting gates, hopped when the gates sprung and
came out slow, raced off of the pace in the four to six path and lacked a bid. CRIMSON STORM stalked three wide, drifted to the five path entering the lane
and faded between horses. BREAKING NEWS vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but yielded turning for home and weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
THETRUTHISTHETRUTH set the pace inside of a prompting rival, felt pressure from a different outer bidder around the far turn, kicked away in upper
stretch and drew off under little urging. MISS TULSA settled off of the pace two to four wide, ranged up turning for home, gained place in upper stretch and
was second best. CARRY ON bumped with an inner rival upon leaving the gates, tracked in the four to two path, chased around the far turn, then held show
from an outer bidder. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME lacked speed along the inside, retreated to trail down the backstretch, moved out of last in the four to five path
around the far turn, improved but was denied show. PI YO PRINCESS pursued forwardly from the two path early on, then further off along the inside around
the far turn and failed to menace. JUST PASSING THRU rated at the rear in the four to five path around the first turn, gained five wide and outside of rivals
down the backstretch, progressed to press the leader from the three path with three furlongs to go, but faltered between horses entering the lane.
SEAWARD bumped with an outer rival at the start, pressed the pace setter from the three path, but weakened between horses with three furlongs to go and
was through the late stages. HOT DAME refused at the start. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE START RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE
ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

HIGHLY WICKED crossed over while reaching the front entering the first turn, dictated terms via a comfortable pace and held well from an outer bidder
through the final furlong. MONEY WELL SPENT pursued from midpack along the inside, was roused picking up stride tipping four wide entering the lane,
rallied to take aim on the leader at the furlong grounds but was kept at bay through the late stages. STRAWBERRY SUNDAE stalked along the inside, took
aim outside of the leader while gaining place from an outer foe entering the lane, but only managed to chase, got outkicked for place in midstretch and held
show. SIXTH ANNIVERSARY trailed along the inside, saved ground off of the pace around the far turn then sustained a rail charge. MS. CAJUN QUEEN
pursued from midpack in the four path, then two wide and between horses around the far turn and chased evenly thereafter. GRACELEADSUSHOME
stalked two wide, but failed to keep pace while floating three wide entering the lane and yielded between horses. SKY HIGH SUSAN tugged keenly under
snug restraint in midpack in the three path and between horses around the first turn, the made little impact. LOVERS NEVER SAY never got involved from
the three to four path. SHE TOLD YOU SO saved ground well back but to no avail. GUITAR WOMAN tracked in the four path but weakened around the far
turn. MO BLING took back between horses early on and was outrun in the four to five path.

Footnotes
GLENN'S JUMPER set the pace in the two path as an inner rival applied pressure, drew clear of that one turning for home and held sway under a drive.
TWO DOT rushed forward after a flat-footed beginning to prompt inside of the pace setter, but failed to sustain pressure turning for home, yet kept on to
hold place. FOOLISH STEVE tracked from the three path, tipped to the five path entering the lane, rallied willingly on his left lead but needed more to bid for
place. THE GREEN MO'STER chased in the two path, then lacked a bid before losing show with a sixteenth to go. TWO WORLDS pursued from midpack in
the four to six path, shifted in and lacked a bid. COURAGEOUS TIMMY was slow into stride, trailed in the two path, shifted outwardly nearing midstretch
and moved up on his left lead. DAAHERS BULLY chased in the three path along with an inner rival, but entered the lane in the four path and weakened.
HOMEVIEW lacked speed in the five path, shifted inwardly to the two path nearing the lane and made little impact. LUCKY LOUIE laid off of the pace in the
four path and was done early.

Footnotes
BONS TEMPS ROULE leaned out while last away, lacked speed along the inside, advanced five to six wide around the far turn, sustained a rally to bid for
the lead at the furlong grounds sparking a duel with an inner co-bidder, sparred with that one through the late stages and narrowly prevailed. GAMER NATE
leaned in at the start, tracked two wide, tipped to the four path entering the lane, rallied to bid along with an outer rival at the furlong grounds, dueled with
that one through the late stages but missed. EMILY'S BOY brushed with an outer rival leaving the gates, stalked along the inside, bid inside of the leader
and in the two path in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer pair at the furlong grounds. CYPRESS GOLD bumped with rivals on both sides at the
start, laid off of the pace in the three path, then stayed on in the four path and between horses. BRADFIELD BABY pursued from the four path, entered the
lane in the five path, tipped to the seven path passing the three sixteenths pole and ran on. HOUSE BOURBON brushed an inner rival at the off, stalked in
the three path, drifted five wide entering the lane and yielded among foes. TEMPLE OF PEACE bumped with an inner rival then an outer foe at the start, laid
off of the pace in the two path, saved ground around the far turn, encountered traffic entering the lane and failed to menace. CAPTIVATING STAR brushed
with an inner rival at the start before being sent to the front early on, sped clear in the three path entering the first turn, showed the way off of the rail around
the far turn, but weakened between horses at the three sixteenths pole. COAL COAL BEER was bumped between horses at the start, lacked speed in the
four to two path and made little impact. INVOLVEDNTERACTION tracked along the inside and weakened. BACK BAYOU bumped an outer rival at the start,
raced forwardly early on, but bore wide into the first turn, retreated to trail the field around the far turn and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
MASTER GAME tracked three wide, pressed around the far turn, shifted inwardly while bidding passing the quarter pole, drew clear nearing the furlong
grounds and held sway. FREDDY J laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted four wide entering the lane, rallied on his left lead in upper stretch, changed
over while forging place at the furlong grounds and sustained his charge to prove second best. FROMANOTHAMUTHA brushed an outer rival at the start,
stalked along the inside, chased around the far turn, pursued from striking range behind the leaders in upper stretch and ran on to secure show. KOLOMIO
pressed two wide, then between horses around the far turn, but failed to offer a bid along with his outer counterpart entering the lane, steadied when that foe
shifted across his path passing the quarter pole, then kept on to regain fourth in the final sixteenth and held it from an outer rival. QUATERNION settled off
of the pace three to four wide, fanned to the five path entering the lane, then offered a mild kick. GAMETIME GLADIATOR pursued from midpack in the two
path, then from towards the rear between horses around the far turn, shfited out in upper stretch and failed to menace. HAROLD'S CLOUD set the pace
along the inside, showed the way from an outer pressing pair around the far turn, got headed inside the quarter pole and weakened. REDEMPTION TIME
pursued two wide, then towards the rear along the inside around the far turn, got floated wide in upper stretch and failed to factor. RICKY BOBBY was off a
bit awkwardly and steadied after taking contact from an inner rival at the start, trailed in the four to five paths around the turns and was outrun. THE RIDER
OF KOLOMIO CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MASTER GAME FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE QUARTER POLE. FOLLOWING THE
OBJECTION, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE SAME INFRACTION; NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF
FINISH.

Footnotes
GIGANTE was pinched between horses at the start, rated off of the pace in the two path, launched a rally between horses turning for home, tipped to the
five path to take aim outside of the leaders at the quarter pole, bid in upper stretch sparking a duel with an inner rival, sparred through the final furlong and
prevailed. NORTHERN INVADER stalked the leader from the three path, bid in the four path along with an outer rival passing the quarter pole, dueled
gamely with that one through the final furlong but was bested. POINT PROVEN trailed in the two path, steadied outside of a troubled rival approaching the
five sixteenths pole, launched a rally between horses in upper stretch, shfited out nearing midstretch and sustained belated progress to close in on the
embattled leading pair late. DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, showed the way in the two path, but was headed by
an outer pair at the three sixteenths pole and gave way. VELOCITOR tracked along the inside, took aim up a vacated rail in upper stretch, but lacked a bid
and faded. DAPPER DUDE lacked speed along the inside, took closer order nearing the half mile pole, but took an awkward step along the fence
approaching the far turn and failed to factor. DESERT DUKE brushed with an inner rival at the start, tracked three wide and faded. GLUCKSTADT was
floated out by a bearing inner rival into the first turn, laid off of the pace in the seven to five path, then in the four path around the far turn and made little
impact. MOR VICTORY lugged out into the first turn, settled in stride midpack in the five path but faded around the far turn.

DONCHO vied outside of a rival and in the three path, drew off in upper stretch under light urging and was put to hand with a sixteenth to go. EVAN ON
EARTH vied inside of the eventual winner, but proved no match for that once in upper stretch and remained clear of the rest. LAST ATTACK leaned in and
bumped a rival at the start, stalked three wide, pressed in the four path into the turn, but yielded through the lane yet held show. MIDNIGHT AVENGER laid
off of the pace in the two path and moved up between horses. MAGICAL MOJO bobbled a bit soon after the start, lacked speed in the four path and
improved position. THOUSAND SPRINGS broke a step slow, lacked speed along the inside and failed to factor. HERO WORSHIP chased in the four to
three path into the turn and weakened. BARON OF THE NILE bumped the inner part of the gate while breaking slowly, raced towards the rear in the three
path around the turn and made little impact. LOUIS THE CHAMP pursued from midpack along the inside and faded. KONTEEKEE pursued from midpack
bearing from the five to six path around the turn and faded. FRIO RIVER was bumped by an outer rival at the start then was through early.

Footnotes
TUFANI settled well back along the inside, awaited racing room in the two path around the far turn, entered the lane in the five path, tipped out to the seven
path in midstretch, produced a good kick to bid outside of the leaders in the final sixteenth and drew clear. CONDENSATION pursued from midpack in the
two path, tracked along the inside around the far turn, sustained a rail grind to bid in the final furlong, forged an advantage passing the sixteenth pole, but
was outkicked late and held place. WATCH THIS BIRDIE settled off of the pace two wide and between horses, took the far turn in the three path, swung out
to the seven path entering upper stretch, rallied in hopes of bidding in the final sixteenth, but was outkicked late and missed place. MUSICAL SCORE saved
ground off of the pace, lacked rail racing room in upper stretch, altered out to the four path and between horses nearing the furlong grounds, then stayed on
among foes but missed show. CALLIE'S GRIT tracked along the inside, inherited an advantage with three furlongs to go, shifted out while resisting out
challenges in upper stretch, but was headed by an inner bidder passing the sixteenth pole and yielded between horses late. STORM BAY raced off of the
pace in the three path and failed to menace. FREE LOOK tracked from the four path, bid into the far turn, vied through upper stretch but tired entering the
final furlong. FINANCIAL ADVICE (FR) broke a step slow, laid off of the pace three to four wide, fanned to the seven path entering upper stretch and lacked
a rally. SPARTAN QUEEN was slow into stride, trailed, took the far turn in the four to five path and made little impact. KERRY stalked two wide, bid between
horses at the three furlongs pole, but weakened in upper stretch and faltered. ANN ALEE cleared early on, but wilted between horses with three furlongs to
go and was eased through the final furlong.
