JOLLY BY GOLLY , a forward factor in the three path between horses, disputed the pace around the turn, asserted himself in upper stretch and drew away
under brisk urging. GREAT DAYS AHEAD broke slowly, circled foes four deep on the turn, advanced to mid stretch then flattened out. STRONG FINISH
bumped with VICTORS VALIANT when bearing out at the break, steadied in tight quarters near the five eighths pole, swung four wide leaving the turn and
passed tired foes. RENNIE , four deep prompting the pace into the turn, remained outside horses on the turn and gave way the final furlong. ENTRUST ,
steadied in traffic mid way down the backstretch, hugged the inner and failed to rally. VICTORS VALIANT bumped with STRONG FINISH at the start,
showed speed inside horses and faltered leaving the turn. GREAT CALL showed speed inside horses to the stretch and faltered. O T C WIZ was outrun.

Footnotes
MISS STONES stalked the leader two wide, was pushed along leaving the three eighths, bid three wide to command into the lane, edged clear in mid
stretch, kept on resolutely under right handed asks and proved best. JACKSON'S DIXIE , taken to rate, edged up between rivals mid turn, continued
between foes with aim near mid stretch, altered in and finished gamely to earn the place. LOVELY LIZA dropped off the early pace while about five wide,
gathered momentum when cued and advanced four wide into the lane, gave hard chase past mid stretch, continued on willingly but was out finished for
second. SWEET HEIDELBERG , taken well back early on, saved ground leaving the five sixteenths, worked outward for the final furlong and churned on.
ALAS AND ALACK saved ground stalking the leaders, was under pressure along the rail entering the lane and faded. MEETMEATTHEBEACH sped clear
early, set the pace towards the rail then two wide past the five sixteenths, ceded command into the lane, stayed willingly past mid stretch then weakened.
LADY SERENITY , off slowly as her rider lost the right iron for a few strides, recovered and moved up three wide to stalk past the half, shifted four wide
under a ride in upper stretch and tired. GRACE AND CHARM , two to three wide, failed to respond. O SHAUGHESEY , four wide early, appeared to be
getting out some leaving the three eighths, was pulled up past the five sixteenths and walked off.

Footnotes
REMEMBERING WILBUR prompted the pace between rivals early, dueled outside MOCEPHUS past the five sixteenths, wrested command nearing the
lane, kicked clear under a strong drive in mid stretch then held firm while kept to task. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO edged up early to the inside of rivals and
gained a stalking spot of the duelers, was coaxed along to hold position mid turn, eased out into the lane, took closer order between rivals leaving mid
stretch, angled in, continued on with good effort and saved the place. VELVET GHOST , off the pace and under urging two wide mid turn, moved up to the
inside of runners nearing mid stretch, angled out and finished with good energy between runners. DIXIE GIANT stumbled just after the break, regrouped
and angled out a bit, pulled his way forward three deep near the half mile marker, prompted the embattled leaders mid turn, ranged up four wide under
some asking into the lane, loomed boldly then flattened out late. HE HATE ME , sluggish from the gate, lagged off the pace three wide, angled five wide into
the lane, advanced between rivals leaving mid stretch and churned on. MOCEPHUS , away alertly, gained a slim lead early and dueled inside rivals heading
to the turn, battled to the inside of the winner from the five sixteenths to upper stretch, kept on with effort past mid stretch then weakened through the final
seventy yards. FREE SQUARE broke a step slow, then was brushed, edged up off the rail then checked leaving the far turn, wandered out to about the
seven path in the lane and came up empty. HIS ROYAL G saved ground mid turn and failed to menace. RAD PAISLEY , three wide stalking the early pace,
was under pressure mid turn and gave way through the final quarter mile.

Footnotes
LISA'S PALACE bore in on rivals leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, found room along the inner rail in mid stretch, swept to command then
drew off. REE NEE'S SIX , in the four path mid way down the backstretch, drifted in on the winner leaving the backstretch, circled five deep on the turn, bid
for the lead in mid stretch and flattened out. CHAMPAGNE DANCE , four wide on the turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch, drifted in approaching the
eighth pole and weakened. FLAG SONG FLYIN , a forward factor in the two path between horses on the turn, chased the pace and weakened. BREAKING
RULES showed speed along the inner rail, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way. SHEHERHERS , reluctant to load into the starting gate, lacked speed,
raced in the two path leaving the turn, swung to the six path in mid stretch and was no factor. LORRAINE'S WAY , in the three path between horses on the
turn, chased the pace and gave way. MY CATHOLIC GIRL , two wide prompting the pace for a half mile, gave way. MISSY BOSS , in tight quarters leaving
the starting gate, checked in tight leaving the backstretch. TOHONORSTELLE raced along the inner rail and was checked in tight quarters leaving the

Footnotes
OXIDE drafted in early and settled, edged up nearing the turn then steadied briefly past the half, regrouped to advance along the rail into the lane, bid to the
inside of LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE to take command nearing the sixteenth marker, cleared under a drive then was steadily hand ridden the final yards.
LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE rated within range of the duelers while saving ground, moved up past the three eighths, snuck through along the rail to join
SUBJECT TO CHANGE into the lane, dueled on a short lead while two wide near mid stretch, could not contain the winner but stayed on well to remain
clear for the place. VIRGINIA FULLA , well back early while three wide, angled out mid turn and commenced a run, was fanned widest and seven wide into
the lane, straightened and continued on willingly outside rivals to gain the show. SUBJECT TO CHANGE dueled to the inside of MY BOY COLTON through
the backstretch run, shook clear leaving the far turn, was met from the rail by LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE nearing the lane, stayed on to battle outside that one
past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly through the final seventy yards. ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) , inside early and off the pace, angled out then split
rivals leaving the half mile marker, idled between foes from the three eighths to the five sixteenths, shifted out four wide between runners in upper stretch
and continued with effort. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY lacked speed, made a run six wide and between rivals in upper stretch, stayed on with pursuit to mid
stretch then flattened out. NORTHERN THUNDER lagged back, made progress along the rail from upper stretch to past mid stretch then failed to sustain
through the final sixteenth. PRINCE KHOZAN , two wide early, gained inside rivals with a run past the three eighths, eased out to chase in upper stretch,
lacked a punch past mid stretch and faded. SCIENCE (IRE) , four wide pursuing, stayed in range to upper stretch then gave way. POWER BACK , three
wide into the turn, tired. PATRIOTIC PARTY , lightly shuffled leaving the three quarter pole, dropped far back into the turn and failed to make a recovery.
MY BOY COLTON disputed the early pace outside SUBJECT TO CHANGE, saw that one get away leaving the half mile pole, gave futile chase past the
three eighths and faltered.

ROMINSKI sped to a clear, early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail and was ridden out. GREAT HEAVENS raced along the inner rail on the turn, moved
to the three path at the head of the stretch and rallied. ASSUME NOTHING chased the pace in the two path around the turn and weakened in the drive.
BYK hugged the inner rail on the turn, chased the pace and weakened. FOLE'S NOTION lacked speed, raced in the three path on the turn, was between
horses in the stretch and passed faders. GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR , a forward factor three wide on the turn, was fanned four deep entering the stretch
and weakened. AMPERSAND , caught in close quarters leaving the starting gate, was not a factor. BRILLIANT ICE , four wide entering the stretch, was
outrun. UNION FLEET , no factor, floated five wide turning for home. HEADS OR TAILS raced in the two path on the turn and was no factor. CLASS

Footnotes
BROTHER CONWAY broke alertly, set a pressured pace inside and under some coaxing, came off the rail into the lane, eagerly cleared under a drive
leaving the three sixteenths and kept on with good energy through the wire. THREES OVER DEUCES , off last after bumping with a rival at the break,
moved up a bit three wide heading to the turn, gained two wire nearing the lane, altered to the rail when a seam opened in upper stretch, advanced past mid
stretch and kept on gamely to earn the place. SWILL , bumped at the break, had speed to the inside of foes then rated back off the leaders leaving the five
eighths, was under pressure saving ground mid turn, eased out soon into the lane and closed steadily. GOLDEN CANDY bobbled at the break, quickly
recovered and stalked the embattled leaders three wide, wandered outward near mid stretch, corrected and went evenly through the final furlong. SPUN
AND WON , off the pace while saving ground, angled out for the drive and had some late action. KARAN'S NOTION , bumped at the break, dropped off the
early pace, angled four wide into the lane but failed to generate the needed rally. JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY disputed the pace two to three wide outside the
winner, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and weakened. DIVINE ARMOR , far back into the turn while under a ride and saving ground, stayed inside for
the drive, finished with some interest but never threatened.
