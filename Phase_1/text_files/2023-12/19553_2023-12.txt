Footnotes
CAJUN OCCASION was well rated three wide, made a four wide by the quarter pole, took over leaving the turn and was clear by the furlong marker, then
held well to prove best under crop urging. MORNING THOUGHTS was off a step slow, split rivals on the first turn and then settled three wide on the
backstretch, eased out on the turn and came five wide off the turn and rallied well but could not get to the winner, second best. SYNONYM was away alertly
to set the pace while racing in the two path to the inside, then was headed by the quarter pole and dug in through the lane and ran on to hold on for the
show award. TEMPESTUOUS was off a step slow, settled back early, inside on the far turn, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally. THAT'S MY
BUSINESS was four wide into the first turn, settled on the outside early and had no rally. SOUPER ROYAL MOON stalked the early pace two to three wide,
made a bid between rivals by the quarter pole but was empty the final furlong. MIDNIGHT STRIKES was settled early on the inside and dropped back.

Footnotes
KAZ SWEET HEIST tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, drew out off the turn and then remained well clear to prove best under a
mild drive. MOON WARRIOR was allowed to settle on the inside, swung out three to four wide off the turn and rallied well to gain the place award. SPEAK
OF THE DEVIL set the pace on the inside, then was on the rail to the two path on the turn and was headed leaving the five sixteenths and then proved to be
no match for the winner while losing the place award late, bested rest. DOUBLE O OTTO stalked the pace two wide, then was two to three wide on the turn
and weakened in the drive. DON'T QUESTION ME was settled three wide on the first turn, two wide by the three eighths marker, then dropped to the inside
leaving the five sixteenths and then came up empty in the drive. SOUL STORY was reserved early and then failed to menace.

HAPPY TAPPY TIM stalked the early dueling leaders, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, took over off the turn and drew off under left handed
crop urging to prove much the best. KIRBY was rated early three wide, made a five wide bid off the turn but proved to be no match for the winner while
staying on to be second best. LADY JEAN was allowed to settle early towards the inside, eased out to be three wide by the quarter pole, then shifted back
in to the inside, then was in traffic by the furlong marker, altered course and was up for the show award. ROSES FROM HEAVEN was rated early on the
inside, eased out and made a four wide bid leaving the turn but flattened out. FIELD LETTERS was settled on the outside, four wide on the turn and had no
rally. WICKED T passed the tiring rivals. LIVE AID dueled for the lead and made a two wide bid on the turn but weakened in the drive. MISS ALEX dropped
back. HELLO GRACIE dueled for the lead on the inside and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
NECCO vied for the early lead three wide, made a bid entering the turn and drew clear and moved to the inside, then was sent down leaving the turn and
remained clear to proved best under strong handling. LOUIE'S HEAT was well placed early, tracked the winner two wide on the turn, then kept on willingly
to the wire to save the place award. BEAR OR BULL was slow into stride despite being hustled along, raced four wide on the turn and came five wide into
the lane and rallied well late. BEJUCO chased the pace four wide and needed more late. HE AROSE was off a step slow, trailed early, four wide by the
quarter pole, angled out and had a belated rally on the outside. THEWIPERSONTHEBUS was reserved on the inside, angled out in the lane and had no
kick. WATERMELON CRUSH chased the early pace on the inside and weakened. PRALINESALLSHOOKUP tracked the pace three wide and weakened.
