Footnotes
PRINCE PRANCEALOT hustled clear early, showed the way two wide through the turn and drew off in the final furlong under a drive. CURLIN'S KAOS
broke in and bumped, chased outside a rival up the backstretch, rounded the bend four wide, finished willingly through the lane, failed to make any headway
on the winner late but stayed on to secure the place. FINAL STORM got bumped on both sides at the start, chased the lone leader three wide through the
turn and lacked a bid. TRAVELIN' SHOW off slow to begin, chased four wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and could not threaten. MR. CHIVAS
took a bump from outside at the start, tracked along the rail into and around the bend, asked in the lane but weakened in the late stages. BILLY JOE
SHAVER chased three wide into the turn, moved out around the bend and came five wide into the stretch and could not respond when called upon.
RUNNING TIGER broke a step slow from outside, raced off the pace outside a rival early on, rounded the bend four, five then six wide and was not a factor.
DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE FIRST RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

into the stretch and lacked a bid. GETEMDUSTY broke a step slow, tracked outside a rival, went four wide into the turn, six wide into the lane and
weakened. ATTA BOY LLOYD broke a step slow then got crowded and took up early, chased three to four wide on the turn and weakened. NAHAN chased

Footnotes
BLESSED ANGEL sprinted clear from outside, showed the way three wide through the turn, asked right handed at the three-sixteenths pole, switched to the
left hand midstretch while increasing the lead, went back to the right hand approaching deep stretch and held safely. BACK ON THE STREET brushed the
gate to come away a hair slow, coaxed to a forward position outside a pair of rivals, chased four wide into the lane, kept on through the final furlong and
bested the others while whittling the gap on the winner late. LA PALOMA BLANCA had to steady when running up on the heels of BLESSED ANGEL early,
chased two wide outside a rival into and around the turn, moved out in the stretch and lacked a bid. SUGAR SUGAR broke well then was taken to the back,
trailed three wide into the lane, angled out in upper stretch and could not rally. MODERA chased along the inside into the turn, lost ground around the bend,
moved out in upper stretch and tired.

EL REY DORADO took control early, moved out and showed the way off the rail up the backstretch, rounded the bend three to four wide, flagged with the
whip in the lane, asked right handed past the eighth pole and stayed clear to the wire. DARK MARCUS chased five wide around the bend, stayed within
striking distance into the final furlong but finished evenly late. BIG DRINKER got bumped and crowded leaving the gate, trailed on the inside into the turn,
tipped two wide leaving the bend and produced a mild rally to earn the show honors. HILL SIXTEEN got forced into inner rival at the start, raced up close
outside the leader to the turn, chased four to five wide on the bend, then weakened in the final furlong. RAYS REGAL came in and bothered inner rivals at
the start, tracked two wide then along the rail on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
AFTERNOON HEAT away quickly from outside, chased four deep into the turn, spun five wide into the lane, rallied from outside and drove past inner rivals
approaching the wire. CROSSKIRK chased three deep into the turn, exited the bend four wide, rallied through the lane, challenged in the final sixteenth but
was outclosed by AFTERNOON HEAT in the final moments. EQUIPO A pressed the pace from outside, kept the pressure on three wide through the turn,
took over in upper stretch, put away inner rival past the eight pole but was run down by the outer pair late. SAN JAC chased four wide into the turn, moved
into the three path around the bend and summoned a mild response to earn a minor award. KING ADROCK set the pace inside a rival up the backstretch,
maintained a short lead two wide around the bend, relinquished the lead in upper stretch, fought back into the final furlong, then weakened late. WARRENS
WORLD broke a step slow, got crowded early, raced near the back three then four wide on the turn, churned on through the lane but failed to threaten.
DIVINE FEMININE brushed and put in tight between early, saved ground at the back around the bend, steered out in the lane and improved position.
AGRIGENTO brushed with outer rival early, chased in the two path outside a rival and failed to respond to urging. MIGHTY MATT chased wide up the
backstretch off the pace, rounded the bend five then six wide and failed to menace. KISLOVODSK chased along the rail to upper stretch and weakened
down after.

Footnotes
THRUST pressed the pace from outside, fought three wide around the bend, shook free in upper stretch and was kept to task to the wire. SMARTY NOSE
chased along the inside into the turn, angled out to the four path around the bend, rallied and overtook BEYOND COMPARE late for the place. BEYOND
COMPARE hustled to the front, set the pace inside THRUST into the turn, battled in the two path around the bend, could not keep up with that rival in upper
stretch and was outfinished for second in deep stretch. NUMBER ONE SON broke a step slow and had his path taken at the start, trailed two wide into the
lane, moved out and failed to menace while earning a minor award. CAPACITY tracked off the pace on the inside, saved ground through the turn and was
not a factor. CHASING ALCHEMY stalked off the inside to the turn, rounded the bend four then three wide and weakened. WON BID stumbled and broke
inward, forwardly placed early inside rivals, cut the corner into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
WHOA BUDDY traveled near the back early on, rounded the bend two to three wide, steered out in the lane, rallied to within striking distance with a
sixteenth remaining and got up at the wire. DIVINE RASCAL dueled for the lead from outside, three wide around the turn, battled to the eighth pole, put
away I'M A LUCKY MAN past the eighth pole, led clear into deep stretch and got nailed at the wire. BRUTTO stalked from inside into the turn, asked right
handed around the bend, cut the corner into the stretch and gained the show. TOP OF MY GAME chased outside a rival towards the rear then trailed
leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the bend, angled out in upper stretch, rounded out the superfecta but could not threaten for the top placings.
I'M A LUCKY MAN dueled for command inside DIVINE RASCAL up the backstretch, fought two wide around the bend, stayed on to the eighth pole, then
weakened in the late stages. MISSED CALL dropped back early, navigated the turn three then four wide and failed to menace. TOM BOMBADIL stalked
three wide into the turn, exited the bend four wide and weakened.
