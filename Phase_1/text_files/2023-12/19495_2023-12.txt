Footnotes
BLACKTECA bumped with an inner rival upon leaving the gates, sped clear early on, showed the way in the two path as an outer foe applied pressure,
inched clear of that one in upper stretch, dug in meeting that foe's re-challenge entering the final sixteenth and held firm. TWO B brushed with rivals on both
sides early on, stalked two wide, moved to press the leader from the three path entering the turn, chased after that one shook free in upper stretch,
sustained stride to offer a bid at the sixteenth pole, but was denied through the late stages and fended off an outer foe for place. ANGELIC KNIGHT broke a
step slow, laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the five path while between horses nearing midstretch, rallied to take aim on the top pair in the
final sixteenth but needed more late. COURTMAN brushed an outer foe soon after the start, chased from midpack in the four path and flattened out.
BOULDERING broke a step slow while last away, trailed, moved out of last in the three path around the turn and never got involved. HARPES HILL bumped
with an outer rival at the start before being brushed by an inner foe soon after, then was outrun in the two apth. HALF MAGIC tracked along the inside and
gave way.

Footnotes
SMART WITH HEART leaned out and brushed a rival at the start, stalked along the inside, shifted out to the three to four path around the turn, ranged up
outside of the tiring leader nearing midstretch, forged an advantage at the furlong grounds and drew off. BIKINI BOTTOM chased from midpack in the four
path and rallied to gain place at the wire. MISS PEARL HART sped clear, saved ground well in front around the turn, but began to tire in upper stretch, was
caught by the eventual winner at the furlong grounds, weakened and got nailed at the wire for place. TAP THE KEG broke outwardly, raced off of the pace
in the five path and ran on willingly. QUART HIGH chased in the three path and faded. CARPE OSTENTO (GB) broke slowly while bobbling a bit out of the
gates, then was outrun in the four path. BIG STAR BABY was brushed by an inner rival at the start and showed little from the two path.

Footnotes
CARD TRICK leaned in and brushed an inner rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, built a loose margin down the backstretch, showed the way
well in hand as an outer rival attempted to apply pressure around the far turn, drew off when let out a notch entering the lane and widened under mild
urging. MASTEROFHISCRAFT stalked two wide, applied mild pressure despite strong urging from the rider around the far turn, failed to keep pace with the
leader while meeting bids for place from rivals on either side entering the lane, then secured that position in midstretch. TIZZY INDY was reluctant to load,
trailed in the three path, shifted out to the five path entering the lane and ran on to edge show late. LOU THE BODY transferred light contact from an outer
rival to an inner foe upon leaving the gates, settled off of the pace two wide, gained ground in the four path around the far turn to bid for place entering the
lane, vied for that position through upper stretch but tired entering the final furlong. BOURBON LIFE bobbled a bit at the start, saved ground off of the pace,
trailed entering the lane, shfited out leaving upper stretch and moved up. RED MOSCATO tracked three wide, chased in the three path around the far turn
and weakened between horses nearing the lane. ELEVATED GAME was brushed by an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, attempted a bid for
place entering the lane but weakened soon after.

Footnotes
LUYV was washed out moving to post, set the pace in the two path, shook away from pursuers in upper stretch and was driven home to seal the deal.
CERTIFIED GEM stalked two wide and between horses, moved to the inside creeping closer to the leader into the turn, but bumped an outer rival at the five
sixteenths pole and steadied getting too close to the leader's heels in the process, yet recovered entering the lane, kept on to vie for place and edged that
position in the final sixteenth. BITSY PERFECTMATCH stalked three wide, pressed the leader from the three path around the turn, took contact from an
inner rival at the five sixteenths pole, failed to keep pace with the clearing leader in upper stretch, vied for place with his inner counterpart through midstretch
but was bested passing the sixteenth pole. ENTITLEMENT trailed in the three path and stayed on. VISIONISTA tracked along the inside, failed to sustain
forward position and eased back to midpack into the turn, swung out to the five path entering the lane, but lacked the needed kick to offer a bid. MY ROYAL
PRINCESS lacked speed in the four path despite urging, fanned out to the seven path entering the lane and lacked a rally while hanging on her left lead.
SHEWASN'TEASY was antsy in the starting gate, tracked in the three path, floated to the five path entering the lane and weakened on her left lead. THE
RIDER OF CERTIFIED GEM CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST LUYV FOR INTERFERENCE AROUND THE TURN, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED

Footnotes
GILDED CRAKEN set the pace along the inside, was confronted by a trio of bidders turning for home, shook free of them in upper stretch before meeting
SOLOMON VANDY's challenge at the furlong grounds and gamely held to the wire. SOLOMON VANDY broke inwardly and put an inner foe to crowded
quarters, stalked well positioned along the inside, bided time as outer rivals bid around the far turn, smoothly took aim outside of the leader while claiming
place in upper stretch, ranged up to bid at the furlong ground, sparred through the final furlong but was unable to reach even terms. MONOLITH shifted out
and bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked three wide, bid along with outer rival entering the lane, yielded to the top pair in upper stretch yet held show
thereafter. Z Z'S PRINCE was bumped and crowded between horses at the start, pursued from midpack in the three path, launched a four wide rally into the
far turn to bid with five sixteenths to go, but yielded to the leader in upper stretch, drifted about at the furlong grounds and was denied show. JOINT
VENTURE pressed two wide, bid along with an outer pair turning for home but weakened entering the lane. BIG TAP BABY was bumped by an outer rival
into an inner foe while put to tight quarters between horses at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path, inched closer around the far turn but flattened
out. GRAND ENCORE leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, tracked two wide, chased around the far turn and gave way. BENISSIMO was brushed by
an outer rival at the start and never got involved. ACTIVE DUTY leaned in before being pinched back between horses at the start and was well outrun
thereafter. SOCIAL APPEAL laid off of the pace along the inside and was done early.

Footnotes
PYRENEES popped open the gate pre-race yet was well kept in the stalls, tracked the top pair from the three path, bid outside of them along with an outer
rival entering the lane and drove clear in upper srtetch. EARL OF DASSEL trailed, gained four wide around the far turn to attempt a bid entering the lane but
failed to keep pace with an inner bidding counterpart in upper stretch and was second best. BEAUMONT RED laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted
out entering the lane and moved up late. CAFE RACER prompted two wide, vied into and around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer pair of bidders
entering the lane, yielded, then lost show in the late stages. ONE TRUE GENTLEMAN set the pace inside of a prompting foe, but was headed once inside
of a trio of bidders entering the lane and gave way. GREAT RUNNER laid off of the pace in the three path and faded.

Footnotes
MCAVOY pressed two wide, bid along with an outer rival turning for home, dueled with that one through the final furlong and held gamely as rivals on either
side offered late bids. CAMARO Z leaned inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, tracked in the two path, chased in the three path and between horses in
upper stretch, crept closer to the embattled leading pair in the final furlong, tipped outside of them in the final sixteenth, sustained a late bid between horses
but just missed. SUMMER IN ADRIANE stalked three wide, bid turning for home, dueled with an inner rival well into deep stretch, but missed and got nailed
at the wire for place. HOPE JOE'S RIGHT bobbled before being bumped by an outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the two path, gained in the four path
around the far turn, sustained a steady grind in the five path through the lane to close in on the leaders late but needed more. HAMILTON'S WAY stalked
along the inside, chased while surpassing a tiring inner rival in midstretch, sustained a late rail grind in hopes of offering a late bid inside of the leaders but
needed more. CURLIN GUNNER saved ground off of the pace, shifted out to the five path and between horses in upper stretch and moved up. POLAR
BEAR PLUNGE saved ground in midpack and failed to threaten. BRIE'S MISSION laid off of the pace in the three to two path, fanned to the six path into
upper stretch and made little impact. BENZODINI leaned inwardly at the start, pursued from midpack two wide, chased under urging in the three path
around the far turn and gave way between horses. PEARL OF ACLAIM (GB) set the pace along the inside, but was bested by a pair of outer bidders turning
for home and weakened nearing the final furlong. ROUSSETTE showed little.

Footnotes
FIRINGTOTHEFRONT dueled for the lead two wide while taking the turn in the three path, drew clear entering the lane and held from an inner late bidder.
ISOLATION saved ground off of the pace, sustained a rail rally to offer a late bid inside of the leader, but needed more late. MARY JACK stalked along the
inside, pursued the top pair from the three to four path around the turn, got outkicked for place by an inner rival in upper stretch yet chased well thereafter.
SUPORB tracked from the four path and between horses but failed to menace. SHE'S A BIG STAR was last away, trailed in the two path and moved up.
TAYLOR'S SECRET dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner while remaining a path off the inner rail, but was bested entering the lane and
weakened between horses. SWEET BAY lacked early speed, bore to the five to nine path around the turn and faded. G'S SQUEEZE broke outwardly,
chased in the five path and faded turning for home.
