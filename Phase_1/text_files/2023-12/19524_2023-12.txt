Footnotes
WAIT ON ME broke a step slow, tracked along the inside, shifted outwardly and across rivals' paths to take aim outside of the leader in upper stretch, bid at
the furlong grounds and drove clear. WHAT CAN I SAY set the pace along the inside, vacated the rail in upper stretch, but was bested by an outer bidder
leaving the furlong grounds and saved place from an inner late challenger. TEXAS TIDELANDS settled off of the pace in the two path, then rallied to offer a
late inside bid for place but was denied. HOT PATOOTIE tracked two wide, pursued in the three to four path before tipping to the five path in upper stretch
and ran on willingly. SHE'S MY PRIORITY pressed two wide, chased around the turn along with an outer rival, but faded between horses. GURKHA GOLD
(IRE) trailed in the three path around the turn and made little impact. GUANAJUATO stalked in the three path, then weakened in the four path while hanging
on her left lead.

nearing the lane to bid in upper stretch, forged a narrow advantage at the furlong grounds and inched away late. MISSED THE BOAT stalked in the three
path, bid along with an outer rival in upper stretch, vied through midstretch but was bested and held place. ALL WEST raced at the rear two wide, shifted out
to the five path in upper stretch and ran to gain show at the wire while running out of ground to reach place. SECRET RULES set the pace in the two path,
maintained a clear margin into the turn, met an outer pair of bids in upper stretch, got headed at the furlong grounds and gave way. GIMME SOME MO
chased along the inside and faded.

SAINT SELBY dueled for the lead with an inner rival while taking the turn in the three path, cleared in upper stretch and held sway under a drive. PREMIUM
broke out and bumped an outer rival at the start, then took contact from an inner rival in the early stages, was forced to bump with his outer counterpart
once more and be jostled between horses in the process, tracked along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch, ran on and edged place in the final sixteenth.
SMOKIN RICHIE bumped an outer rival soon after the start, rushed forward to duel for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but yielded to that one in
upper stretch and lost place lat. HE'S A BOMB tracked in the four path and lacked a bid. HEZA PRIORITY was off a step slow, shifted away from an inner
rival and bumped an outer foe at the start, trailed in the five path, drifted to the eight path entering upper stretch and moved up on his left lead. MEN OF
KYLE was bumped by an inner rival and last away at the start, then made little impact from the three path. LYRICAL POET was bumped by an inner rival at
the start, then bumped with that one again in the opening stages, laid off of the pace along the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
TIME TO MEDDLE set the pace along the inside, inched a clear margin around the far turn and held sway. IZEONDEC settled off of the pace in the four
path, advanced in the three path around the far turn and sustained progress to gain place in the shadow of the wire. OFFSHORE TITHE broke outwardly,
pressed two wide, chased around the far turn, yielded and lost place late. FABLED RULER lacked speed along the inside, shifted out nearing the lane and
ran on willingly. HUMOR ME PLEASE trailed in the four to two path and passed tired rivals. CLASSIC RUNNER tracked along the inside, chased under
urging in the two path around the far turn and faded. CHILI RED broke half a step slow, tracked in the four path and weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
SUNDAY BREEZE was last away, settled off of the pace in the four to three path, moved between horses turning for home, fanned to the six path entering
the lane before being floated to the eight path in upper stretch, rallied to offer a late bid while shifting ground inwardly and forged an advantage in the
shadow of the wire. MONARCH'S MISCHIEF tracked in the three to two path around the first turn, advanced inside of rivals approaching the far turn, took
aim while stalking outside of the leader around the far turn, bid entering the lane, cleared approaching midstretch but was caught at the wire and saved
place. SILVER GALAXY saved ground off of the pace, tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane, but drifted to the four to six path while inside of
rivals at the three sixteenths pole, sustained a rally along with an outer rival through the final furlong but missed reaching place. TOUCHDOWN JOE stalked
in the two path, chased in the three path and between horses around the far turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane before being floated to the seven
path and between horses in upper stretch, then yielded shortly after. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT set the pace along the inside but was headed in upper stretch
and weakened. PEPPER JACK pursued from midpack in the six path, but retreated to trail at the five furlong pole and was done early. COFFEE COUNTY
stalked outside of the top pair while tugging in the five path around the first turn, chased in the four path around the far turn then weakened while being
floated to the seven path entering the lane.

SPIN THE BREEZE veered inwardly at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside, picked up stride entering the lane, rallied to split the leaders at the
furlong grounds and drove clear. CLEAR VOICE stalked the embattled leading pair from the three to four path, offered a bid in upper stretch, but was
outkicked by an inner bidder leaving the furlong grounds and was second best. MISCHIEVOUSNESS broke a bit outwardly, chased from the four to six path
and stayed on to gain show late. GALADINI dueled for the lead two wide, entered the lane in the three path, but yielded between bidders leaving the furlong
grounds and lost show late. OH MACARENA broke slowly, lagged behind the rest into the and and made little impact. SOTONA dueled for the lead inside of
a rival, but weakened inside of a trio of foes at the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
AMERICAN DOLLARS stalked in the three path, bid along with an outer rival into the far turn and drew off in upper stretch. VERO CAMPIONE pursued from
the four path, bid three wide into the far turn, vied with the eventual winner turning for home, but failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch and held
place from an inner bidder. PUNCHIE laid off of the pace along the inside, then stayed on to bid for place but was kept at bay. RENATI broke outwardly and
bumped a foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path, then in the three to five path around the far turn and ran on. LACEY'S STAR failed to factor.
LINCOLN PRODUCTION was bumped by an inner rival and steadied at the start, trailed and moved up. PARKER NOW prompted along the inside before
scooting clear entering the backstretch, but was headed by an outer bidding pair into the far tur and weakened. ST PIERRE made little impact. RONALDS
GATSBY showed the way two wide around the first turn, but stalked a clearing rival entering the backstretch and weakened around the far turn.
