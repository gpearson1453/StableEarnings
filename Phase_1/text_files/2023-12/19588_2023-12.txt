Footnotes
GIRVINIZED raced in the two path around the first turn, led the way on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and dueled to the wire
to just hold the win. NAIL POLISH saved ground around the turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming
around the turn and dueled gamely to the wire but could not get past the winner. UGHROUDA saved ground around the first bend, settled in the middle of
the pack for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and kept on to the finish. SAVE THE FLAG raced off the pace on the inside
through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the three path and never threatened. FILTERED LIGHT raced in the three path early,
continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, saved ground around the second turn and showed no kick. DALLAS raced in the two path around
the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. BIG JAVA raced in the two path around the first turn,
chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path and tired from there.
