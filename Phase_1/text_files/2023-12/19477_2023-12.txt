TRULY MISCHIEF raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and kicked
clear in the stretch. MISTERCHILLIWILLI pressed the pace on the outside early, continued around the turn in the two path and chased the winner home in
the lane. GENERAL COMMAND raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the bend from the two path
and improved position in the stretch. SAN ANDRES dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and
gave way in the final furlong. THE GOLDEN ONE reared up leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the outside early, came around the turn in the three
path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and flattened out in the lane. ERUDITE bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, raced off the pace on
the rail through the opening quarter, dropped back to trail the field from the two path around the bend and never threatened. DISCREET DEVIL bumped with
the horse to his inside at the start, recovered to duel up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch. DR. ROGER raced in the
middle of the pack on the outside early, came around the turn in the three and four path and was empty in the lane.
