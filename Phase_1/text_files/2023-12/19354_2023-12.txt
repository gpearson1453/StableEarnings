a forward factor in the two path around the turn and in the stretch, chased the winner in a willing effort. HAMPDEN LANE hugged the inner rail, offered a
move to mid stretch and failed to sustain the bid. TUNA N STAMPS chased the pace racing in the three path around the turn and gave way in mid stretch.
BORUFF , always near the inner rail, was outrun. DUCKPINS , four deep on the turn, chased the winner to the stretch then gave way. REAP WHAT YOU
SOW faltered mid way on the turn then swung to the five path at the head of the stretch.

Footnotes
LONG LIVE NOW settled off the pace while towards the inside, angled out leaving the far turn and gathered steam when put to pressure, circled four wide
into the stretch, made a grinding run under left handed asks and forged past PRINS FIRE in the final strides. PRINS FIRE angled out bumping a rival
nearing the seven eighths pole, was corrected and taken to rate off the leader, moved up along the rail and took over leaving the five eighths, handled
outside pressure around the final turn, spurted clear under a ride in upper stretch, remained well in front past the furlong grounds, switched over to his left
lead a sixteenth out, wandered outward and failed to last. MOON SIGN was sent clear early, set the pace removed from the rail, was joined from his inside
after a half mile, battled with the winner into and around the final turn, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened late. SPIRITUAL GHOST lagged back off the
pace while saving ground, angled out around the final turn, came four wide for the drive and got past tiring rivals. OBOY , bumped by PRINS FIRE when
tracking around the first turn, chased outside a rival into the far turn and weakened. O T C WIZ , three wide early, angled in for the backstretch run, edged
up some past the five eighths, failed to kick on leaving the three eighths and faltered.

Footnotes
ROYAL SEAMSTRESS , hustled to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, was under brisk urging in mid stretch and pulled away. FINALJUMP
hugged the inner rail most of the trip and passed tired foes. GOLDEN CHARM raced in the two path between horses on the turn and finished evenly. I CAN
DO IT circled foes on the turn, floated five wide turning for home and was not a factor. QUIT QUAY , outrun, swung to the five path entering the stretch.
NAMI bore out leaving the starting gate, was outrun and angled six wide in upper stretch. SHE'S ALL MONEY bore on soon after the break, chased the
pace racing along the inner rail, eased out to the two path approaching the stretch and faltered. SOULFUL TARA , a forward factor in the three path
between horses leaving the turn, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
CLASS ACTOR took over inside runners leaving the chute, set a rated early pace towards the rail, was headed by TREPAT after a half, stayed on the inside
of rivals while pushed along past the five sixteenths, came back to take command into the lane, clung to a slim lead dueling with IRISH WARLOCK through
the final furlong, kept on tenaciously under strong handling and narrowly prevailed. IRISH WARLOCK broke a bit slow, was hustled up inside foes then
angled out nearing the five eighths, bid three deep around the far turn, emerged in a battle outside the winner leaving the three sixteenths, continued gamely
to the wire and just missed between horses. MY MAMBA , off the pace between runners, moved inside around the turn, edged up along the rail past mid
stretch, came out late and finished well to gain. STEELE MONEY saved ground off the pace, angled out under a ride leaving the five sixteenths, came five
wide for the drive and closed steadily. TREPAT rated two wide just outside the winner, moved to a slim lead between rivals after a half mile, sparred to the
head of the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and faltered. PRIDE OF PAYTON , three deep near the half mile marker, came four wide for the
drive and failed to rally. FREESTANDING , in the clear stalking a contested pace, was put to pressure leaving the far turn, tired nearing the lane and was
eased late.

Footnotes
LADY SERENITY sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, remained on her left lead in the stretch and prevailed under urging. SANSA

VICTORINA trailed to the turn, raced in the two path between horses entering the stretch and offered a slight rally. RUN RAEGAN RUN chased the pace
while in the two path on the turn and weakened. NEED A MARKER chased the pace, angled to the three path leaving the turn and gave way. ALAS AND
ALACK , four wide on the turn, was no factor. MISS FUSSY PANTS raced in the three path on the turn while outrun. ASTONISHING ANABEL , three deep

Footnotes
ROMINSKI vied outside a rival early on, moved clear under rating leaving the far turn, turned away a threat from TAKE A HINT nearing the lane, opened up
after being called upon in upper stretch, was kept alert with one left handed ask leaving mid stretch, widened and coasted home through the final fifty yards.
TAKE A HINT , well placed three wide off the duel past the half, ranged up to loom past the five sixteenths, failed to quicken with the winner leaving the
three sixteenths but kept on with effort to be second best. FREEZE THE FIRE , urged along inside rivals, moved to the two path exiting the far turn, shifted
out wider into the lane and continued on willingly to earn the show. HEMP , taken to rate while saving ground early on, continued inside into the lane, eased
out past the three sixteenths and churned on. GOODTIMETOBEIRISH was sent up to the inside of rivals and joined the winner past the five eighths, sparred
to the turn, gave hard chase around the turn, stayed willingly to about the sixteenth pole then faded. TWICE GOLD broke slowly, saved ground around the
turn and failed to menace. LOST WEEKEND , off the pace, raced three wide nearing the lane, swung out well wide past the three sixteenths but failed to
threaten. REMEMBERING WILBUR , urged three deep early, was fanned five wide into the lane and faded. TENAX , outrun, raced wide in the drive. SUE
LOVES BARBADOS , between rivals pursuing, drifted to about the four path into the stretch and weakened.

FEELING WOOZY sprinted clear soon after the break, set the pace along the inner rail, was under brisk urging in mid stretch and steadily pulled away
through the lane. CURLIN'S MALIBU , a forward factor along the inner rail, chased the winner and was best of the others. ARMANDO R lacked speed
despite urging on the backstretch, swung four wide entering the stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. ONE TEN , along the inner rail on both
turns, eased out to the three path entering the stretch and weakened. BODE'S MAKER , three wide the first turn, chased the pace, was two wide around the
far turn and faltered in upper stretch. TREASURE TROVE , three wide both turns, faltered leaving the far turn. THE ADDISON POUR , steadied when
squeezed back soon after the break, trailed.

BENEATH THE STARS , patiently handled racing inside rivals and tracking the pace, eased out approaching the quarter pole, closed determinedly under
left handed asks, took over leaving the sixteenth pole and drew clear. QUICK MUNNY quickly went clear while a bit headstrong, was guided towards the rail
and taken to rate, kicked away from POGGIBONSI leaving the far turn, came under pressure while guided two wide in upper stretch, dug in when
confronted leaving mid stretch, gave way grudgingly through the final fifty yards and was well clear of the rest. I'M GITTIN THERE , between rivals and in
range near the half, shifted in around the turn, stayed inside with some run past mid stretch but failed to impact the top pair. PRODIGY DOLL , hustled up
early, pursued three deep leaving the three eighths, failed to seriously kick on in mid stretch then faded. CANOODLE , urged from the gate, raced well back
mid turn, came four wide for the drive but lacked a rally. POGGIBONSI was hustled up early and bid outside QUICK MUNNY near the half mile pole, had
that bid rebuffed but stayed on to chase, was under asking between runners past the five sixteenths, lacked a punch a sixteenth late and dropped back.
