Footnotes
ENGEE OMBEE close up to the moderate early pace, gained three wide nearing the quarter marker, vied into the stretch, took command at the furlong
grounds, dug in into the final stages and lasted over oncoming rivals. SHEZA QUEEN BEE unhurried in the early stages, raced outside of rivals heading to
the quarter marker, swung five wide into the stretch, closed willingly late, could not get by the determined winner in the final strides and held for second.
STANDFORGRIT forwardly placed early on, steadied while in tight leaving the five-furlong pole, tracked the moderate pace from the inside, saved ground
into the turn and advanced at the quarter pole, rallied inside of the furlong marker, was outfinished in the final strides for second and held at the wire for
third. DADDYS NINA rated off of the moderate early pace, was asked for run two wide and between runners nearing the turn, came in tight approaching the
quarter marker, was boxed in into upper stretch and found room nearing the furlong marker, was outkicked in the late stages and missed for third at the
finish. TIME TO SMILE lacked early speed, saved ground while trailing through the turn, swung wide into the stretch, drifted in the final furlong, improved
position in the late stages but could not impact the leaders. LUCKY LOCKETT asked for speed in the early going and pressed the decent early pace,
pressured EXTREME BLAZE through moderate fractions heading to the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch and held a narrow advantage
approaching the furlong pole, could not keep pace inside of the furlong marker and gave way. EXTREME BLAZE sent to establish the early lead, set
pressured fractions into the turn and carved out a moderate pace while pressed to the quarter pole, lost the lead into upper stretch and faded in the final
furlong.

Footnotes
BOSS NINE off a step slowly, recovered and assumed command in the early stages, was well handled through decent fractions into the turn, showed the
way to the quarter marker, came under a bit of pressure in upper stretch and responded to urging heading to the furlong marker, turned away LAUGHING
LEGACY nearing the final sixteenth and kicked clear to prevail in the late stages. LAUGHING LEGACY bumped with SUMMANUS away from the gate,
tracked the decent early pace from the inside, advanced approaching the quarter marker, tipped two wide into the lane and mildly pressured BOSS NINE
into upper stretch, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and held for second at the finish. SONOFAFINCH chased the decent early pace, ran in pursuit two
wide and between runners approaching the quarter marker, raced three wide into the stretch and lost position at the furlong pole, re-rallied in the final
sixteenth and held well for third. LOADED MUSKET bobbled then broke out at the start and was off a bit slowly, tracked the decent pace from the inside,
angled three wide into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and was outfinished in deep
stretch. SUMMANUS bumped with LAUGHING LEGACY at the start, chased the decent early pace outside of runners, raced three wide to the quarter
marker and swung four wide for the stretch drive, lost position at the furlong marker and weakened. MR. CLUTCH broke alertly, took back to track the
decent early pace and raced outside of rivals heading to the half-mile marker, was steered to the two path into the turn and chased to the quarter marker,
swung five wide into the stretch and did not threaten late.

Footnotes
DORIE MILLER away in good order, rated nicely in the early stages and tracked the decent pace three wide, advanced into the turn and pressed the pace
three wide approaching the quarter pole, inched closer to BOURBON TIGER into upper stretch and battled heading to the furlong pole, drifted in while
battling with BOURBON TIGER and crowded that foe nearing the sixteenth-marker, took command into deep stretch, was all out to hold off the runner-up in
the final strides and lasted for the win at the finish. DEFICIT MAJA hit the gate at the start and was away a bit slowly, was allowed to settle and tracked the
decent pace from the second flight, was well placed into the turn and raced two wide to the quarter marker, was roused four wide into the stretch and
loomed nearing the furlong grounds, rallied into the final sixteenth, pressured DORIE MILLER in the final strides and just missed for the win at the wire,
while besting the rest. PRINCESS BELLE unhurried in the early going, was steered to the two path into the turn and trailed to the quarter marker, swung five
wide into the stretch, made a mild gain at the furlong marker, closed well into the final sixteenth, could not impact the top two at the finish and was clear in
the end for third. BOURBON TIGER bobbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, showed speed and assumed command in the early stages, set a decent
pace while prompted into the turn, was pressed by a pair of rivals to the quarter marker, responded to urging and held foes at bay to mid-stretch, was
crowded by DORIE MILLER when that rival drifted in nearing the sixteenth-marker, could not match strides with oncoming foes in deep stretch and gave
way. BETTOR BET'R chased the decent pace from the inside, angled four wide at the furlong grounds and did not offer a late rally. KRISTIN LEE prominent
away from the start and vied for the early lead, ceded to BOURBON TIGER and pressed the pacesetter into the turn, pressed the decent pace between
rivals heading to the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and chased to the furlong grounds, lacked a late response and faded. PER RULING FROM
HIWU, DORIE MILLER IS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
PRESTIGIOUS was unhurried and allowed to settle near the rear, made steady forward progress down the backstretch, saved ground and bided time
through the far turn, then tipped out five wide for the stretch run and finished up well under steady handling to prevail. DORINE'S WILD CAT tracked the
pace three wide for a half mile, bid for the lead approaching the seven-sixteenths, inhaled the leader near the quarter pole and pulled clear, battled with
PRESTIGIOUS through the final furlong and gave way grudgingly in the final yards. SHEZA LUCKY CHARM came away well, raced three wide through the
clubhouse turn and then mid-pack down the backstretch under a light hold, was let loose passing the half mile pole, then gained ground while racing three
wide through the far turn, was unable to match strides with top pair but outlasted the rest to hold third. SILVER FLIRT was a little slow into stride then took
the inside path through the first turn, remained near the rear and to the inside to the far turn, tried to launch a rally from the five-sixteenths pole while taking
a four wide path into the stretch, ran on some but lugged in while racing on the wrong lead. ZEE PERFECT RUN lacked any early speed, chased the field
throughout and managed to pass one in the final furlong. HARBOR'S BEAUTY broke sharply and got first run into the turn, led the field through comfortable
fractions to the far turn, gave way readily when challenged by DORINE'S WILD CAT near the five-sixteenths pole and finished evenly. JUST SERENE was
encourage to get forward position early got a stalking trip two wide through the early going, remained just behind the lone pacesetter to the far turn, was
unable to keep up when the top pair quickened away, came under a ride from the five-sixteenths marker and tired. PLEASANT WARNING angled in and
saved ground going into the first turn, was ridden to keep pace while tracking from a few lengths back, stayed to the inside through the far turn and had
nothing to offer in the stretch.

Footnotes
DAWN AT LAST away in good order, dictated terms early on while pressed, was well handled into the turn and carved out a moderate pace to the quarter
marker, shook free into the stretch, widened the lead while kept to task into the final sixteenth and held sway. ALL HALLOWS raced close up to the
moderate early pace, ran in pursuit three wide to the quarter marker, chased DAWN AT LAST into the stretch, was no match for the winner in the late
stages and bested the rest. OUT OF STARS took back off of the early pace, was allowed to settle and saved ground into the turn, swung four wide into the
stretch and improved position at the furlong marker, was not able to impact the top two in the final stages but closed well late and held safely in the end for
third. RHONDA'S COOKIN chased the decent early pace, raced outside of rivals into the turn and came three wide to the quarter marker, swung four wide
for the stretch drive and did not offer a late rally. DADDY INDEED asked for early speed, was forwardly placed away from the start and chased the decent
pace from the inside, lost ground two wide along the turn, ran in pursuit to mid-stretch, did not respond in the final sixteenth and weakened. LOCHMARA
was a bit slow into stride away from the start and was allowed to settle, chased three wide along the turn, swung to the five path into the stretch, drifted out
in the final furlong and did not factor. LISA'S VALENTINE chased the decent early pace, lost ground into the turn, was coaxed along three wide into the
stretch and did not threaten. ZOE'S PRIDE prominent away from the gate and pressed the decent early pace, kept pressure on DAWN AT LAST while two
wide and between runners at the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

SLEW'S JOY settled off of the decent early pace while never far back, was guided outside of runners and loomed three then four wide nearing the top of the
stretch, ran in pursuit of BELLY UP to the furlong marker, inched closer to that rival then battled into the final sixteenth, wore down BELLY UP in deep
stretch and edged away to prevail. BELLY UP sent leaving the break, established the early lead and set decent fractions while pressed into the turn, shook
free nearing the quarter marker and held foes at bay approaching the furlong grounds, was confronted by SLEW'S JOY inside of the furlong pole, battled
with that rival into the final sixteenth, was gamely bested in deep stretch and held safely in the end for second. TRINIDAD broke out at the start, crowded
HAPPY DOES leaving the break and was away a bit slowly, was allowed to settle and saved ground into the turn, was roused at the quarter marker and
swung five wide into the lane, improved position at the furlong marker, finished well in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. TESSA (GB) broke
alertly, raced close up to the early pace while outside of rivals, maintained a three wide path into the turn and chased BELLY UP to the quarter marker,
advanced into upper stretch and vied between rivals at the three-sixteenths marker, lost position inside of the furlong pole and weakened in deep stretch.
TRAVEL THE MAP fractious in the gate, was prominent leaving the start and pressed the decent early pace from the inside, lost position into the turn and
chased to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. HAPPY DOES crowded at the start and was off a bit slowly,
lacked early speed and raced two wide into the turn, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
SAREEHA (IRE) took back off of the early pace, tracked outside of rivals into the first turn and raced four wide into the backstretch run, made a middle move
and came within aim heading to the half-mile marker, pressed RAVEN'S QUEST along the far turn, battled with that rival into the stretch and took command
approaching the furlong pole, drifted out nearing the sixteenth-marker, was kept to task into deep stretch and held in a drive to prevail. RAVEN'S QUEST
broke alertly and was sent to establish the early pace, was well handled through moderate fractions heading to the half-mile marker, came under pressure
from SAREEHA along the second turn, battled with that rival into the stretch and lost the lead nearing the furlong grounds, stayed on into the final sixteenth
but could not muster the needed response in deep stretch, was outfinished and just held for second in a blanket finish for the minor awards. DOWNBURST
was allowed to settle and saved ground into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace two wide to the half-mile marker, lost ground into the far turn and
chased two wide to the quarter marker, came in a bit tight nearing the top of the stretch, tipped three wide for the drive and improved position at the furlong
marker, closed willingly in the final sixteenth, just missed for second and won the nod for third on the wire. VILLA NOVA settled in the second flight, raced
three wide along the first turn and was well placed into the backstretch run, chased two wide along the far turn then tipped four wide into the stretch, finished
well in the final stages and just missed for the minor awards. CHURCH HARBOR stumbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, rushed up in the opening
furlong and stalked the pace into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, lost ground into the far turn, chased two wide into the
stretch and made a mild gain at the furlong pole, needed more in the final sixteenth and was outkicked in deep stretch. TIZ MY PRINCESS allowed to settle
in the early stages, raced three wide into the backstretch run and was unhurried to the half-mile marker while not far back, lost ground into the far turn,
swung six wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole and found her best stride late. BOURBON GLAZE forwardly placed in the early stages, was
rank and hard to place along the first turn and into the backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace while saving ground into the far turn, raced evenly into
the stretch and did not offer a late response. OH ANGEL fractious in the gate, was unhurried early, saved ground into the backstretch run, swung five wide
into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
MISTY CAT was not asked for speed from the gate, saved ground through the first turn then rated in the back half of the field for the run down the
backstretch, advanced into contention through the far turn, came into the stretch five wide, gradually wore down rivals to the inside and pulled clear inside
the sixteenth pole. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS was allowed to settle from the break, angled in once clear, made a nice mid-race move on the rail through the
far turn, ran on well under strong handling and earned the place. GRIGORO tucked in towards the rail racing behind the leaders through the clubhouse turn,
relaxed nicely in the run down the backstretch, stayed inside through the far turn, moved into contention passing the five-sixteenths marker, was between a
trio of horses trying to run down KITTEN'S KID in deep stretch, kept on determinedly but came up short. KITTEN'S KID was hustled to the front and gained
the rail and the early lead, was left alone to set the pace with solid fractions, held sway through the far turn, came into the stretch with a clear advantage
then weakened in the last furlong. BUSKER ALLIE was last away, settled in the rear, saved ground to the far turn, moved out to a path for the run through
the turn, tipped out to the five path for the stretch run and was slowly making up ground in the late stages. BANDEENA raced close up and four wide
through the first turn, then dropped off the pace down the backstretch, fell back to last on the far turn, still three to four wide, got a second wind turning into
the stretch and made a mild rally. LIGHT UP was a bit keen traveling three wide through the first turn, raced up close down the backstretch under some
restraint, was asked for more approaching the three furlong pole but did not go on and was outrun in the stretch. LIAM'S SECRET stalked the pace for a half
mile, then came under some pressure, started to lose ground through the far turn and had nothing to offer down the stretch. PER RULING FROM HIWU,
MISTY CAT WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.
