Footnotes
PLAY THE TRUMPET pressed the early leader off the inside, crept closer to duel late in the turn, put that same rival away when straightened for home,
kicked steadily clear under a right handed crop, lost crop late. MIRAGE veered out at the break to be last away, void of early foot while working way toward
the rail, saved ground through the turn, steered back out for the drive, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. SUPERHERO moved up after
the start to show the way along the rail, continued to hold a narrow advantage over the winner through the bend, faltered when headed by that one into the
lane. LEAD FOOT broke sharp, fell back soon after, four wide into the lane, improved with some mild interest, no real threat. DANTHECONCRETEMAN
behind the early pace toward the inside, steered out to be four wide for the drive, went evenly through the lane. PROFESSIONAL GRADE prompted the
issue for a half in the three path, backed up through the lane. LUCKY IS MY NAME moved outside into the turn, angled back in a bit late in the bend, also
came up empty for the drive. BLOWOUT MOUNTAIN trailed throughout to be always outrun.

Footnotes
TOMA TODO broke on top, showed the way through the first turn in the two path, dueled up the backstretch and into the far turn, regained a clear
advantage late in the final turn, held the runner up safe the final furlong. MAN ON THE MOON also away in good order, pressed inside, dueled along the rail
into the far turn, briefly put a head in front, fell back off the winner midway on the final bend, shifted out, could not get back to the winner late, far clear of the
others. KHOZY MY BOY prompted the leaders three wide for six furlongs, proved no match for that pair through the lane. RIVER BOY went one paced
throughout while racing off the inside. CHISHOLM TRAIL saved ground to no avail in lacking a closing response. YAK settle in mid pack, turned in an even
effort while four wide into the first turn, steered in second bend. CALIPARI broke back, lacked early speed, improved slightly while never a serious threat.
READY TO ROLL broke back, four wide into the first turn, failed to muster a rally. GEORGIA DEPUTY off a bit slow, five wide into the first turn when
remaining back, no threat. FETCHS BRAHM was finished early, well back. VIM AND VIGOR fell far back, well beaten.

BRESLAU pressed the issue up front in the two path and between horses, wore down rival through the lane. LAKE RADIO pace inside, responded when the
the winner applied additional pressure into the lane, gave ground grudgingly. FULL AUTHORITY forced the issue three wide, saved the show. HOME RUN
TRICK failed to menace while racing inside. SHADOW MATTER fell back to trail off the inside, four wide into the lane, was not a factor.

Footnotes
REDFIELD stalked the pace from along the inside in hand, called on for some run late in the final turn, rail bid inside the furlong marker, drove clear.
CHARLESTON within striking distance three wide, continued outside, roused for the drive, up late for the place. MONEYSHOT broke on top, set the pace
along the inside, continued to show the way into and through upper stretch, relinquished the advantage to the winner inside the furlong grounds, caught late
for the place. CRUSADING pressed the issue while racing off the inside, had little left for the drive while between rivals into the stretch. REVELATION off a
step slow, raced back off the pace, lacked a closing response. EL MATADOR failed to menace while racing in the two path. SILVER TONE fell back to trail,
well beaten.

Footnotes
SHUTUP PLEASE in the second flight off the inside, waited in some traffic late in the turn, split foes nearing the furlong marker and edged clear under
steady handlng. PAT'S GAL moved up to duel along the inside soon after the start, continued to hold the advantage into and through upper stretch, proved
stubborn until late. PETULA prompted the pace from the three path, remained in good striking position into the lane, lacked a closing punch. K J'S PISTOL
ANNIE dueled up front outside the runner up in the two path, first to blink in midstretch. BLONDES HAVEMO FUN broke to the inside, raced in mid pack
toward the inside, in some traffic turning for home, went evenly to the wire when clear. ELMO'S SECRET lacked speed along the inside, improved through
some traffic into the lane, flattened out the final furlong. SMARTY'S ANGEL bothered to be off slowly, raced back, in some traffic into the stretch, improved
position a bit while not a serious threat. THURSDAY MORNING in the second flight early, took back in some traffic nearing the four furlong marker, again
early in the turn, lacked a rally when clear for the drive. BE MY HUCKLEBERRY off a step slow, remained back. DIXIE GIRL TO was never involved.
COROMANDEL hopped, broke out to be away slowly, four wide turn, tired. BETTY JO in mid pack for a half, backed up through the lane while five wide into
the stretch.

SIMONA'S CHOICE took control after the start, shook off a bid from a rival into the stretch, held the runner up safe late. AMERICAN BAND forwardly placed
along the inside, in some traffic into the turn, moved off the inside for the drive, slowly getting to the winner late, clearly second best. ROCK STAR
PARKING off a step slow, raced four wide through the turn, staged a mild rally to earn the show, not a threat to the top two. CARTEL QUEEN raced in mid
pack off the inside, lacked a closing response. RIGHT TRAPPE saved ground through the turn, lacked a closing response in the drive. LUCY'S CAKES FLY
off a step slow, trailed most of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat. COST A FORTUNE within striking distance outside, tired
through the stretch. DIVA TREVA chased the leader up the backstretch, moved up to duel turn, gave way in the drive while getting out a bit exiting the turn
and down the lane.

Footnotes
LUNA VIEJA settled off pace inside, steered out turning for home, lugged out under a left handed crop in upper stretch brushing with LUCKY BOSS, was
righted then came out again under continued left handed pressure to bump that same rival then narrowly gained the nod at the wire. LUCKY BOSS void of
early foot after breaking a step slow, rallied four wide into the lane, brushed by LUNA VIEJA when that one was lugging out in upper stretch, bumped in a
similar episode a furlong out, missed at the wire. CANAVALL chased the leader off the inside, engaged that one from the outside in the second turn, proved
no match for the top pair through the lane, clear of the others. ROCKING ROCKET broke on top, set the pace inside, weakened when confronted in the
second turn. KOBLA MAS broke back, trailed when devoid of early foot, picked off some tiring rivals while never a threat. DANCE SOME MO in mid pack
early, made a mild middle move, backed up the final quarter. KANT BEAT THE ROCK mid pack, had nothing for the drive. LIFE ON THE NILE forwardly
placed in the early going, began a steady retreat after a half while four wide through the final turn. FIGHTERTOWN was finished before a half, well back.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF LUCKY BOSS AGAINST LUNA VIEJA FOR INTERFERENCE
THROUGH THE STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
BURNINHUNKOFLOVE moved up to set the pace after the start in the two path, continued to hold the advantage through the turn, shook clear past the
furlong marker, enough left late to hold the runner up safe at the wire. ETERNALLY GRATEFUL off a step slow, raced well back early, began to accelerate
while saving ground through the turn, knifed out late, good surge to be rapidly getting to the winner late. COLONEL VARGO vied up front in the early going
along the inside, fell back off the winner turning for home, altered course with a furlong to run, finished up eveny to remain clear of the rest. BORN
FLAWLESS went one paced in the two path throughout. SHACKLEFORD STRONG within striking distance while racing three wide, came up empty the final
furlong. ATOMIC TONE in mid pack while well off the inside, three to four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. SPOTTED BULL broke back, made
little impact while racing off the inside. COST BASIS tired while racing four wide. GOLDEN LUNA five wide into the far turn when racing in mid pack, fell
back and continued to back up through the lane.

FROSTED DEPARTURE broke sharp, cleared toward the inside, set the pace along the inside, kicked strongly clear through the lane. SILVER
PROSPECTOR in mid pack, moved closer in traffic with just over a half mild remaining, chased the winner past the furlong marker, proved no match for that
one while finishing in determined fashion to earn the place. FULL SCREEN chased the winner early off the inside, prompted that one the middle part,
remained closest to that one through upper stretch, caught late for the second spot. BUCK MOON forwardly placed inside, continued to save ground second
turn, lacked a closing response to go evenly through the stretch. COMMANDPERFORMANCE broke back, lacked speed inside, four wide into the stretch,
improved position with some mild late interest. DECISION MAKER off a step slow, raced back, five wide turning for home, passed tiring rivals. WHELEN
SPRINGS stumbled badly at the break, raced back, bothered by a fallen rival past the half mild marker, continued back to the finish. PATS PROPERTY in
the second flight outside, steadily backed up after five furlongs. HOZIER lacked speed, raced back off the pace toward the inside, fell over a stricken foe
with just over a half mile remaining and unseated rider. TONKA WARRIOR moved closer before a half in tight quarters, clipped heels and fell, unseating
jockey. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGADING THE RUN LATE ON THE BACKSTRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN JACK floated out at the break but was still away well, dueled up front closest to the inside, edged clear final furlong. MASTER OF ARMS away in
good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, could not match strides with the winner late, held sway for the place. BOOGIE BODE broke out, tracked
the pace off the inside, getting to the runner up late. LORD GRANTHAM back off the pace the outside, improved a bit three wide, flattened out late.
UNSTABLE PRINCE void of early foot, saved ground into the turn, asked along late in the bend, moved out for the drive, improved position. HOWL YEAH
floated in a bit to be off slowly, raced back, showed some mild belated interest up the the inside to improve position. UNBOWED forwardly placed for a half.
LITTLE FRAPPUCINO floated out at the break, settled in mid pack, lacked a response in the drive. PASSION OF JOE'S broke out, was straightened to race
three to four wide through the turn, tired in the drive. IMMORAL steadied at the start, remained always back. DIRECTIONAL bothered at the start, was
finished early.
