Footnotes
MIDNIGHT'S GIRL vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, took the lead around the second turn, drove clear and held on well for the win.
SHE'S GONE D'WILD unhurried in the early going, made a steady gain, rallied down the home stretch, dueled with FASTED to the wire, couldn't catch the
winner, but got up for second. FASTED pressed the pace, eased back, made a late try, dueled to the wire with SHE'S GONE D'WILD and was outfinished
for second. ATOMIC ROSE went to the front, saved ground around the final turn and weakened. DREAM TOWN raced near the middle of the field, came
around the second turn wide and finished evenly. WATERS OF MEROM lacked early speed and was never a threat. PAINTBRUSH always raced near the
back and showed little. ESSENTIAL BELLA hesitated and hopped at the break, racing in the rear, rushed up, near the front, coming around the first turn
wide and retreated to the rear.

contention, was close throughout and proved no match for the top two. HEZA SEXY ZONG raced in the rear in the early part, improved position, but was no
factor. HALF FULL raced near the back and was never a threat. THUNDERTAKESDALEAD broke well, dropped back and was outrun.

Footnotes
SAN JUAN HILL raced within contention, came around the turn four wide, rallied and proved the best late. ALL OF US lacked early speed, made a wide rally
and finished willingly. DIAL UNCLE JOEY raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn, split rivals down the lane and was a clear third.
RAZZ pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and weakened. FLASH FREDDIE was unruly in the gates, broke a step slow, racing from the back,
showed late interest, but was no factor. THA ILLEST DEAL went to the front, saved ground and faded. DEAL WITH HIM raced in the middle of the field,
came around the turn wide and faded. REGINALD AURELIUS pressed the pace, was finished early and dropped back. SABERMAN void of early speed and
was never close. BRIMESTONE KID lacked early speed and was outrun.

weakened. SPECIAL STORMY hopped at the start, racing near the back, improved position, but was no factor. EL KECZAL raced evenly near the back and
showed little. COWBOY CAUSE raced within contention, finished wide and faded. IRISH MOON always raced near the back and showed little. FREE DROP
