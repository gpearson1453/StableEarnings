turn, gave way approaching the quarter pole and chased on to the finish. THIRSTY DATE raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the bend and improved position mildly in the stretch. SHE'S THAT GIRL veered in leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack through the

the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the turn, tripped over RAIN OF BLESSING when that rival fell in front of him at the
quarter pole, fell and lost his rider himself and later walked off. RAIN OF BLESSING stalked the pace setters on the inside up the backstretch, continued
around the bend in the four path, was bumped by inside horses when LUNA AMARILLA came out at the quarter pole, fell and lost his rider, and later walked

Footnotes
BOLD BLUE led the way between horses racing up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and held clear to the finish. THE BIG CALICO
stalked the pace setter on the outside through the opening quarter, swung out the five path coming around the bend and gained ground late. ROCKY'S
EXPRESS tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and kept on in the lane. KING MATINA was
fractious in the gate, broke well to press the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend, gave way nearing the quarter pole and
chased on in the stretch. DIVINING STONE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, navigated the turn from the five path and improved position
mildly in the final furlong. ALCAZABA (IRE) hopped up and was pinched back leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the rail for the run up the
backstretch, came around the bend in the four path and finished evenly. MAGIC HOOH tracked the pace setters on the inside up the backstretch, navigated
the turn from the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. AMERICAN DAY raced off the pace through the opening stages, saved ground around the
turn and made no bid. TIMO chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and weakened in the final
furlong. SHADY BOY trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.

around the second bend and continued to battle gamely in the lane, giving way late and narrowly missing. CHEM MAJOR saved ground early, dueled on the

lightly with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn from the three and four path, gave way nearing the quarter pole and chased on from there. AFERDITA hit the gate leaving it, raced in

Footnotes
RITAAN raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the three path, swung wide into the
stretch to began a bid and gained ground late to get up for the win. LADY LANCER bumped soundly with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, settled
in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the turn, began a bid in upper stretch and
gained ground late but narrowly missed. TAYYARA tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and
chased on in the stretch. BINGO STAR raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the early going, came around the bend in the five path and
improved position in the lane. MIGHTY GIN GIN pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path around the turn,
kicked clear in upper stretch and weakened late. MISS POLO BAR raced off the pace up the backstretch, came around the bend in the four path, switched
inside to began a bid entering the stretch and improved position from there. STURDY GIRL raced at the back of the pack on the outside early, navigated the
bend from the two path and never threatened. QUEEN P chased the leader up the backstretch, continued pursuit of that rival from the three path around the
turn and faded in the stretch. REDHAIREDCOLLEEN raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground
around the bend and was outkicked in the lane. SHADY BABY stalked the pace setter on the inside through the opening stages, came around the bend in
the three path and flattened out in the stretch. LUNA WEST veered in sharply and bumped with the horses to her outside at the start, recovered to lead the
way from the rail up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and tired in the stretch. R TOOTSIE GLITTER bumped with the horses to her
inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path and was empty from there.
