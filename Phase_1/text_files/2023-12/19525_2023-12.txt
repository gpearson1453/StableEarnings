Footnotes
NOBLE WAVE set the pace in the three path down the backstretch, was confidently handled in the two path rounding the far turn, cued in the three path at
the top of the lane, tipped inwards, and drew clear. MOHAY PLEASE stalked in the four path, was coaxed into the far turn, shifted to the rail in upper stretch,
but evened out for place. SOLAR FLASH raced off the pace in the two path, was ridden into the far turn, but never threatened.

Footnotes
VINSANITY stalked the pace three wide, took over in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. ZAINO broke slowly, raced well back three wide, tipped out
in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and ran on for the place. ADIOS NOW broke awkwardly, raced off the pace two wide and was along
the show. MAGMA saved ground off the pace and had a mild rally. EASTBOSTONBENNY hit the starting gate, had speed between foes while trying to lug
in the down the backstretch, chased at the rail around the turn and tired in the final furlong. OZONE set the pace in the two path and gave way in upper
stretch. AIR FORCE ROYALTY failed to menace while racing four wide. GIURO had early speed inside, steadied nearing the far turn and retreated in the
three path around the turn.

FLIRTINI set the pace in the two path, was roused approaching the quarter, and kicked away in the four path down the stretch under a drive. DEFENDED
pressed the winner in the three path, was driven in the four path around the turn, lost touch with the winner at the top of the lane, but kept on for place.
FAST KIMMIE chased in the two path, was ridden in the three path turning into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. TALKING WONDERS trailed in the
two path, fanned out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but was one paced. VINGATIVA stalked inside, was coaxed from the rail passing the
three-eighths, cut the corner going into the stretch, but flattened. LADY AZTECA prompted the pace in the four path but weakened turning into the stretch.
MOONSHINING raced off the pace in the three path but never menaced.

Footnotes
SALVATTORE PRINCE bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the two path, waited for room under a nudge around the far turn, was cued while
angling out to the eight path in upper stretch, and rallied past an inner foe around the final sixteenth. CUBAN THUNDER (IRE) raced off the pace in the five
path, loomed up under coaxing around the far turn, bid from the seven path turning into the lane, ran on to lead on his left lead passing the eighth pole, but
was caught late by an outer foe to place. DONTBESOOGROUCHY trailed in the two path, was driven in the four path around the far turn, swung out to the
six path entering the lane, but was one paced for show. BANNEKER tracked in the four path, bid midway around the far turn, took the lead from the three
path into the stretch, but faded. STEELER MISCHIEF rated in the three path, but was a bit rank early down the backstretch and had to steady passing the
five-eighths, had to steady again midway around the far turn, went wide into the stretch, and was no factor. ZIO LORENZO prompted the pace in the three
path, bid between foes going into the far turn, but yielded in upper stretch. K'S STORM READY chased in the two path but never menaced. OUR LEGAL
TENDER bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the two path but gaveway from the rail at the top of the lane.

bumped between foes at the start, raced off the pace inside, angled out near the quarter pole and rallied for the place. RAPTURE BAY raced in range two
wide, lacked the needed rally and held well enough for the show. JABRAN came out and bumped foes at the start, set the pace in the two path and tired in
the lane. LAST RUN broke awkwardly and was outrun inside. HE'S A BUTTE was bumped at the start, stalked the pace in the four path and was through

Footnotes
SCOOTALOO set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. ON COMMAND chased the pace three wide, was no match for winner but kept on to
be clearly second best. VANDELLA raced in range four wide, lugged in in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally while holding third. FANTOMAH failed
to menace while racing two wide. TAPIT'S STARLET was reluctant to load, broke slowly and never threatened while racing three wide. URGENCE had brief
speed inside. COSMIC SYMPHONY was fractious in the gate and trailed inside.

SHASTA STAR dueled for the lead in the five path, loomed a threat in the three path while in hand rounding the turn, drifted out to the eight path in upper
stretch, and inched clear in the final sixteenth. ST. PAT'S DAY hit the gate leaving, rated in the two path, tipped out to the seven path under coaxing turning
into the stretch, was herded further out passing the eighth pole, but ran on for place. GITANA pressed in the three path, bid between foes around the turn,
but evened out from the three path in the stretch for show. TEMERITY chased in the four path but never threatened. WALKS LIKE A LADY vied for the lead
in the two path, led along the inside around the turn, but faded in the stretch.
