BOWTOTHEQUEEN was well rated early on the outside, made a three wide move on the turn while in hand, took over off the turn and then drew clear to
prove best while being ridden out, speed to spare. MADELINE'S GROGU tracked the early pace, came four wide into the lane and finished well late to get
the place award. LOVING CUP was allowed to settle early, swung out three wide leaving the turn and had a late rally. HOT FUDGE WARRIOR dueled for
the lead on the inside and faded in the drive. NEWSDLEY dueled for the lead to the outside and was two wide on the turn, between rivals off the turn and
weakened. POSITIVE FORCE was close up early but steadied leaving the nine sixteenths and dropped back, then shifted out on the turn and was five wide
by the quarter pole, no threat. ASUE was close up early and stopped.
