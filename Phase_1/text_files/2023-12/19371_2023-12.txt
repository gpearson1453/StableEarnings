FLASHY LASS was stalking the pace while inside on the backstretch, was blocked a couple of times and taken in hand, waited until the middle of the far
turn to moved out to be two wide then drew away in late stretch to be clearly best in the end. HOLLY DOLLY set a pressured pace while inside, was well
handled then was in a long drive on the far turn but weakened in late stretch. CINNAMON FACE pressed the pace while between rivals on the backstretch,
was shuffled back off the pace before the far turn then failed to menace in the stretch. OLIVIA'S RACE DAY stalked the pace while three wide on the
backstretch, made a bid on the far turn then faltered in the stretch. GHOST BAYOU pressed the early pace while in the three wide, was used up and gave
way.
