Footnotes
DR. SNYDER vied for the early lead, took command around the final turn, pulled away and won under steady urging. WHISKEY RED challenged for the
early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. JUST BECAUSE void of early speed, made a steady
gain and proved no match for the top two. LITTLE WARRIOR lacked early speed, made a mild bid, but was no factor. ADMIRAL RISTY dueled on the front
end in the beginning, saved ground and faded down the home stretch. DEE'S LEGS raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. ROCKY
BOY bobbled at the start, raced in the rear and was never a threat. WINNING DANCE always raced near the back and showed little. VESTMENT raced
within striking distance in the early part, dropped back and was outrun.

Footnotes
BALLINONABUDJET unhurried in the early going, made a steady gain, rallied three wide down the home stretch and proved the best late. VENN vied for
the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, was outfinished late for the win, but held on for second. PLAY MO raced within striking distance, moved up on
the outside around the second turn, took the lead, but was outfinished by the top two. WICKED ROSE void of early speed, saved ground around the final
turn, gained ground, but was no factor. BAYOU JAM lacked early speed, improved position, but was no threat. OAK HILL LG pressed the early pace, faded
and was no threat late. BLUE CHEESE raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. AVAILABLE STAR pressed the early pace and made a steady
retreat. GUITAR SLIM raced in the middle of the field and dropped back. JACK BOB AND LARRY dueled on the front end and dropped to the rear.

SHUT UP MAN raced in the front end, being reserved, saved ground around the second turn, drove clear down the home stretch and was kept to the task.
DOUBLE TRAP lacked early speed, came around the final turn on the outside, made a wide bid and got up for second. SWEET RACHEL raced within
contention, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for second. BREW CREW raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort.
HONORARIAN dueled on the front end in the beginning and faded. TAPALIST always raced near the back and was never a threat. WESLEYAN was unruly
in the gates, lacked early speed and was never close.

for the top two. CARBON STRYKER lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn, showed late interest, but was no factor. JAZZY JUSTIN raced in the
middle of the field and put forth an even effort. MISTS OF TIME void of early speed and passed tired ones. LODE OF BLARNEY raced evenly near the back

Footnotes
BASALT STREET dueled on the front end, was challenged throughout and just held on for the win. MUCHMORETHANREADY unhurried in the beginning,
made a steady gain, rallied down the home stretch and needed more. WORLD WAR dueled for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late
kick. OLIVIA G pressed the pace, was close throughout and finished evenly. TINCANDANCE raced in the back of the pack, improved position, but was no
factor. COURTLY DOC raced near the middle of the field and was never a factor. ALLIACEOUS raced in the middle of the pack and weakened. A WISH
FOR MADELYN raced within striking distance and made a steady retreat. MO CLASSY lunged forward, popped the gate open early and was declared a
non starter. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED CONCERNING #6 MO CLASSY AT THE START OF THE RACE. AFTER VIEWING RELAYS
STEWARDS DECLARED HER A NON STARTER.
