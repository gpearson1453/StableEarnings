Footnotes
DATE NIGHT KISSES pressed the early pace three to two wide, made a two wide bid on the far turn to be clear by the quarter pole, then kicked away
leaving the turn, then drifted out by the sixteenth marker but maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best under crop urging. DOCTOR ABBIE was
four wide into the first turn, settled on the outside, then advanced three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, shifted out by the furlong marker
and then rallied while drifting in late, second best. SWAN POINT was reserved early on the inside, moved out on the turn and came five wide into the lane,
shifted to the far outside and had a belated rally to gain the show award. FOXY JUNIOR chased the early pace five to four wide, made a three wide bid on
the turn by the quarter pole, but flattened out in the drive. NEW HIRE was rated along the inside and saved ground throughout but had no significant rally.
PERFECT HIDEAWAY tracked the early pace four to three wide, then was two wide by the quarter pole and weakened. LA CIENEGA set a pressured pace
on the inside and was headed by the five sixteenths and weakened. EIGHT DANZAS was reserved early two wide and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
NIEUWENDYK was three wide into the first turn, then went up to set the pace and move to the two path, turned back a bid from SILK PRINCE and shook
clear leaving the turn, then was all out late to hold on to prove best. PRACTICALLYMINE was off very slowly, settled back, advanced two wide on the far
turn, shifted out leaving the turn four wide and closed well but could not get by the winner. SILK PRINCE tracked the early pace in between rivals, made a
three wide bid nearing the quarter pole but flattened out. BACK EAST chased the pae four wide and came five wide into the lane and had a mild late rally
but needed more. MOMENT AT SEA was well placed on the inside and tired. ROWDY RED GLARE had a four to five wide pursuit early and then tired.
TWIST OF FAITH was five wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four to three wide and tired.

Footnotes
SOPHIA'S ROSE was away alertly to set a pressured pace early while racing off the inside, then came three to four wide off the turn and drew off to prove
much the best while being ridden out. DANCING BEAUTY broke in at the start bumping a rival, made a four wide move on the turn and was three wide off
the turn, finished willingly but was no match for the winner but second best. MYGIRLSACROWNJEWEL was settled early on the inside, advanced on the
turn and eased off the inside and came four wide into the lane and finished well to gain the show award. DAZZLING DEMELZA stalked the pace three wide
and was two wide off the turn and weakened, lost show award late. SHE'SACHUBBLEMAKER was settled early and three wide on the turn, came four wide
into the lane and had no kick. WELL HANNAH was bumped hard at the start, reserved early, shifted out on the turn and came five wide into the lane and
improved position. FORCEZILLA chased the pace two wide and weakened. TOUGH AS NAILS pressed the early pace on the inside and weakened.
CONTEMPTUOUS MISS was settled back early, saved ground but never threatened. FOXEY G was off slowly and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DEVINE FLAMEAWAY bobbled at the start, then recovered and went up to set the pace while clear and off the inside, two to three path on the turn and
came four wide off the turn while widening the margin, then was put to a vigorous hand ride through the lane to prove much the best. WARRIOR BERNICE
tracked the winner two to three wide and proved to be no match for that rival while being second best. WORK FROM HOME was rated along and then got
keen and moved up the inside nearing the half mile marker, then had to check hard leaving the half mile marker, recovered and settled back into stride on
the inside on the turn but lacked a late response, bested rest. DESTINANO was dwelt at the start spotting the field double digit lengths, then moved up and
advanced two wide on the turn, came four wide off the turn but flattened out. BIG SMILE stalked the early pace three wide and then was empty on the turn.
CUTADAY chased the pace on the outside and weakened.

OPENING HOURS was five wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to shake clear, then turned back a bid from
SIR PALACE PRINCE and edged clear late to prove best under crop urging. SIR PALACE PRINCE was settled back early and raced off the inside, made a
five wide move on the turn to loom boldly but hung late, clearly second best. JACK CLOUD set the early pace two wide, then dropped to the inside and was
headed on the far turn and faded, held show award. GINO THINKABOUTIT chased the early pace three to four wide, then was ridden along early on the
backstretch, dropped to the inside by the five sixteenths, then swung out fiver wide leaving the turn and had no late kick while racing evenly. PLUOT
prompted the early pace three wide and weakened. CHIPANDAPUTT was between rivals on the first turn, tracked the pace along the inside down the
backstretch and weakened. POLIE was six wide into the first turn and had a five wide pursuit early and tired. WARRIOR AT BAT chased the pace on the

Footnotes
CARTE BLANCHE was well rated early on the inside, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, hit the front nearing the furlong marker and slowly edged
clear to prove best under crop urging. WENTZ prompted the early hot pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to shake clear, then was
outfinished by the winner while running on stubbornly. CAPE HEDGE was taken back early, advanced on the outside on the far turn, came widest into the
lane and rallied well late. JUST NOD AND SMILE was settled early towards the inside, then shifted off the inside and advanced five wide by the quarter
pole, then had a mild late rally but needed more. MERU was settled early three wide, then was two wide entering the far turn and three wide by the quarter
pole but lacked the needed winning rally. ARISTOCAT pressed the pace two wide early, between rivals by the half mile marker and then weakened. PECOS
BILL was off a step slow, then settled back early and failed to respond. HIGHWAY BOUND set a pressured pace along the inside and gave way.
