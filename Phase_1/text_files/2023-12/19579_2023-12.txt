Footnotes
SCOTT ALAIA stalked the pace outside, took over after half a mile and quickly extended margin while drawing off handily. LADY YELLEN forced the pace
inside, dueled the winner briefly and lasted for the place. J J LOVES BILLY dropped far behind then advanced wide to gain the show. CEDAR VALLEY
lacked speed then passed rivals without menacing. BRAMBLE BUSH chased in midpack inside and lacked a solid rally. GORMLEY GIRL stumbled at the
start, chased near the inside and was no factor. LONDONDERRY broke very slowly and was never in contention. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE prompted the
pace along the inside and was finished by far turn. ONE WILD WOMAN broke in a complete tangle and was always far behind. FRANKLY MY DEAR
earned a narrow advantage in the opening quarter outside then stopped.

Footnotes
VINE JET broke out bumping a rival at the start, stalked between horses, chased on the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, dueled with the runner
up, dug in gamely outside that rival and prevailed late. MR. EINSTEIN was reluctant to load, off slowly, stalked close up outside, chased on the far turn, bid
between rivals entering the stretch, dug in gamely in the final furlong and yielded grudgingly. JUPI'S LIGHTNING was bumped at the start, raced three wide
early, vied outside for command, took over on the far turn, dueled into the stretch and weakened. MOLIERE was squeezed back at the start, outrun early
and closed belatedly inside. MAGNETRON bobbled at the break and was bumped, raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane and had no rally.
MOON OVER MONTANA raced off the rail, off the pace, chased on the far turn and lacked a rally. SUNNY SAINT was bumped at the start, vied inside for
the lead, dueled, chased on the far turn and gave way. SETTE STELLE raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. MERU tracked on the inside, chased
on the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
TREVESSO outrun early, angled out in the stretch, bid to the front in midstretch and lasted driving. DROPLINE was urged close up inside, moved out on the
turn and closed strongly just missing. LION IN THE SUN dropped back four wide then closed well in the final furlong. JUST STEP ON IT soundly bumped at
the start, dropped well back and rallied mildly. WHO KNOWS forced the pace outside to the stretch, bid clear then weakened. LANIE'S FIRST DUDE came
in bumping rival at the break then was never a factor. JAKNAVA trailed early, moved very wide on the turn and was no threat. UTILITY chased off the pace
inside and retreated. BERNIE'S MITTS set a pressured pace to the stretch then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
CHAIN REACTION outrun early inside, angled wide on the turn, offered a late surge and wore down the pacesetter in the final yards. AVA K'S BOY vied
four wide to the far turn, shook loose, opened a long lead but was nailed at the wire. INDIRECTLY far behind early, rallied strongly inside through the stretch
too late. JEBOLOGIST vied between rivals then pursued inside on the turn tiring. BOX OF CHOCOLATES trailed early, was in tight when blocked at the top
of the stretch. MISCHIEVOUS JONES chased near the inside in midpack and failed to menace. DOCTOR DOOM dropped far behind wide and was never a
factor. BIG BAD BUD lacked speed chasing wide and was never in contention. LIVING WATER raced outside under urging and began fading on the turn.
NIMBLE BEAST flashed speed in the two path and gave way readily. LORD UHTRED earned a slight advantage inside in the opening quarter and gave
way.

rallied outside of the winner turning for home, made a bid and then dug in to hold second. NOISY ON THE BAY pulled on the first turn, moved up and was
forced to check between horses at the three quarter pole, then stalked the leader, chased inside on the far turn and rallied mildly on the rail in the stretch
run. NAMORA stalked close up outside, chased three wide on the far turn and weakened. MARIA SAYS SO raced two wide off the pace, saved ground on
the far turn and lacked a rally. MERRYCHILL raced off the pace inside and did not factor. LUCKY OPPORTUNITY raced four wide early, vied outside on the

UNCLE HEAVY broke a step slowly, advanced very wide on the final turn, angled inside through the stretch, collared the pacesetter and edged off driving.
NOTICE OF ACTION stalked the pace outside, moved clear on the final turn, drifted out then back in through the lane and could not withstand the winner.
ADDYSON'S DREAM raced close up four wide then flattened out in the stretch. CARCHAROTH moved close up inside, angled out on the turn then
weakened in the stretch. LOVE SHAQ lacked speed then passed rivals without menacing. SOCIALLY AWKWARD raced within range to the final turn and
faltered. STANDPOINT dropped back early and gave way readily. RIDLEY PARK trailed far behind then passed a fading rival. BLAMEITONMYMOMMA set
a pressured pace to the far turn and stopped abruptly.
