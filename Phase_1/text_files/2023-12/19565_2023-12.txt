FLOWERDEW , steadied in close quarters inside CONCEPTUALIZE leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail while in hand waiting for room on the
turn, found an opening inside DEARLY approaching the stretch, eased off the rail in upper stretch, closed determinedly late and was up in deep stretch.
RILEY G , three deep on the backstretch, gained the lead and went clear entering the turn, raced along the inner rail through the stretch and gave way
grudgingly. SOMEBODY LOVES ME lacked speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. CONCEPTUALIZE bore in leaving the
starting gate, raced in the three path on the turn and weakened through the stretch. PRINCESS CAIRO , urged soon after the break, showed speed, raced
in the two path between horses into the turn and gave way in upper stretch. DEARLY advanced along the inner rail entering the turn, drifted to the two path
approaching the stretch, raced on her left lead and gave way. MY SASSY VALENTINE broke slowly, circled the turn four deep and retreated through the
stretch.

Footnotes
MY FLICKER , patiently handled saving ground and off of a contested pace, edged up along the inside in upper stretch, eased out and worked her way
between rivals past mid stretch, kept on determinedly to bid inside foes, gained a slim lead past the sixteenth marker and held firm. ROYAL WHISPER , five
wide early, dropped in a few paths and quickly gained behind the leaders mid turn, shifted back out to be four wide into the lane, ranged up to draw on even
terms with a sixteenth to go, battled gamely outside the winner and just missed. MYSTIC SEAPORT , three deep attending the pace, took a slim lead after a
half mile, cleared under a drive in mid stretch, could not resist threats leaving the sixteenth marker and faded. WHISTLER'S STYLE broke awkwardly then
was put in tight, regrouped and settled off the pace, advanced inside past three sixteenths, worked well out in the track through the final furlong and churned
on. KILLY START , bumped at the break, chased outside a rival past the three eighths, came three wide for the drive and continued with interest.
POGGIBONSI sped to the front, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure into and around the turn, ceded command entering the lane, stayed willingly to
mid stretch then faded. BLACK ICE , off the pace while saving ground, eased out in the drive and had belated action. CANOODLE , bumped at the break,
pursued to the inside of a rival leaving the three eighths, shifted out and came up empty. WINKIWINKI disputed the pace between rivals, remained a
presence to the three sixteenths then weakened. PROPER ATTIRE , four deep in close attendance, failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened.

pace around the turn, raced in the two path in the stretch and gave way grudgingly. MINIMO , inside horses for a half mile, eased out leaving the turn, had a
three wide bid for the lead in mid stretch and just missed. NOTION IN MOTION , rated behind horses down the backstretch, began to advance along the
inner rail on the turn, checked lacking room at the head of the stretch, swung outside in mid stretch and closed gamely. EL DE LARRY raced near the inner
rail on the turn, moved to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. SIMON'S CHOICE , four deep on the turn, weakened. HOW U DOIN
circled horses on the turn, was four wide entering the stretch and failed to rally. WHATAHARDMANFIDEAD , three wide chasing the pace around the turn,
weakened. VOLPE , a forward factor in the two path between horses on the turn, gave way. DOUBLE NICKEL raced in the two path inside horses on the
turn, was taken to the six path near the quarter pole and failed to rally. SEEKER bumped by MUCHO DE LA MANCHA at the start, chased the pace while
two wide and gave way. MUCHO DE LA MANCHA bobbled then bumped SEEKER leaving the starting gate then was outrun.

Footnotes
HEADLAND , away in good order, was joined by DREAM CHASER from her inside early on, disputed the pace under rating while two to three wide,
responded and moved clear soon into the lane, kept on under right handed encouragement through the final furlong and held sway. APPLE PICKER tracked
the dueling leaders while about three wide, came under pressure mid turn, circled four wide with aim into the lane, drifted in a bit and pinballed off of
MOODY WOMAN near the three sixteenths, recovered and finished gamely to gain. DREAM CHASER was sent up to the inside of the winner early on and
gained a slim advantage, sparred under coaxing slightly off the rail around the turn, ceded command approaching the stretch, lost her footing when
switching leads soon into the lane and came out a bit bumping MOODY WOMAN, corrected and kept on with effort. MOODY WOMAN , off the pace and
under urging, picked up the pace three wide mid turn, edged up between rivals entering the lane, was jostled between foes soon after, recovered to pursue
between horses from mid stretch to the sixteenth pole then came up empty in the final yards. WORST BEHAVIOUR , off the pace, shifted out leaving mid
stretch and had belated action. I'M GITTIN THERE , towards the inside, moved up slightly inside rivals in mid stretch then flattened out. Following a
stewards' inquiry into the run in upper stretch and objection by the rider of MOODY WOMAN against DREAM CHASER, DREAM CHASER was disqualified
and placed fourth. An objection by the rider of MOODY WOMAN against APPLE PICKER alleging interference in upper stretch was not allowed.

I'M A CUTIE PIE showed speed along the rail, disputed the pace inside SHARP EYES, drifted out near the three sixteenths pole, went clear, drifted out the
final sixteenth of a mile and held sway. STILL GAME , alertly taken to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, remained along the rail thereafter and rallied.
SHARP EYES disputed the pace outside the winner, steadied when that one came out in upper stretch then weakened. SKY VICTORY , outrun, was four
wide leaving the turn then passed tired horses. BEACHFRONT BREEZE , three wide stalking the pace around the turn, was fanned four wide in upper
stretch and faltered. SHAKE IT BABY , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and faltered. An objection
by the rider of SHARP EYES against the winner for alleged interference at the top of the stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
GREELEY AND BEN settled towards the back while wide and off of a contested pace, was under pressure three to four wide leaving the three eighths,
angled seven to eight wide leaving the three sixteenths, closed relentlessly outside a host of rivals and forged to victory in the final yards. DOLLARIZATION
, never far back while saving ground early on, angled out nearing the quarter pole, moved up leaving the furlong grounds, dropped back in to work between
rivals and gamely nabbed the place inside foes. NO CENTS , bumped soon after the break, pulled his way to contention in the opening furlong and emerged
in a duel outside HE'SMYHONEYBADGER, vied in hand around the turn, wandered outward under pressure past mid stretch then kept on valiantly between
foes. COWAN stalked inside a rival, eased out advancing into the lane, moved up five wide to put a head in front in mid stretch, battled between rivals then
hung very late. FACTOR IT IN tracked the duel three wide outside a rival, angled six wide for the drive, made a grinding run past mid stretch then came up
between horses nearing the wire. STAGE LEFT , four wide under asking mid turn, angled seven wide in upper stretch, closed in outside a rivals near the
sixteenth marker then hung through the final yards. MYSTIC O'SHAUNESIE rated off the pace while saving ground, eased out to gain between foes near
the sixteenth pole, shifted back in but lacked the needed finish. NICO , bumped then squeezed back at the break, had a non threatening late gain. SIR
ALFRED JAMES , bumped at the break, settled back off the pace, was under pressure between foes near the quarter pole and failed to menace.
HE'SMYHONEYBADGER was sent hard to contention, dueled to the inside of NO CENTS from about the five eighths to upper stretch, failed to go on a
furlong out and weakened.

SADDLE UP JESSIE , eased off the inner rail leaving the first turn, stalked the pace outside PEYTON ELIZABETH down the backstretch, took command
leaving the far turn, pulled away under steady encouragement and raced on her left lead the final sixteenth of a mile. HYBRID ECLIPSE , a forward factor
along the inner rail down the backstretch, moved to the two path leaving the far turn, brushed with LADY BREW in upper stretch and rallied. LADY BREW ,
three wide leaving the first turn, was brushed by WARRIOR'S RANSOM entering the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, brushed with HYBRID
ECLIPSE in upper stretch and failed to be a late threat. CIRCLE HOME bore out at the break, was immediately taken to the inner rail, saved ground around
the first turn, trailed, swung four wide at the head of the lane and passed tired foes. WARRIOR'S RANSOM , three wide entering the first turn, brushed
LADY BREW entering the backstretch, raced between horses down the backstretch and faded leaving the far turn. PEYTON ELIZABETH set the pace along
the inner rail and faltered.

Footnotes
DOUBLE CROWN rated close up while saving ground, eased out nearing the lane, closed in under strong handling and drew alongside OFFALY COOL with
a furlong remaining, battled nose to nose as both rivals wandered outward, kept on determinedly and got the bob. OFFALY COOL urged from the gate, took
command into the first turn, was nursed along just off the inside while handling outside pressure, edged clear past the three eighths while still under rating,
came under a ride soon into the lane, dug in when collared nearing the eighth pole, drifted outward while sparring through the final sixteenth and just missed
in a sharp try. MAGIC MICHAEL settled off the leaders and raced in the clear near the half mile marker, took closer order leaving the far turn, dropped in
towards the rail and was put to a hearty ride past the five sixteenths, came back out some pursuing past the three sixteenths but came up empty in the final
yards. BE BETTER lagged off the pace, angled out five wide while under a drive into the lane, straightened and steadily gained. LUIGI'S SPIRIT , four wide
outside rivals stalking the pace, was under pressure leaving the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened. AIN'T DA BEER COLD ,
three wide outside the leader, forced the issue into the far turn, could not keep pace past the three eighths and faltered between foes.

MO TOUGH hugged the inner rail on the turn, moved to the two path approaching the stretch, closed resolutely outside LITTLE BABY GIRL and was up
late. LITTLE BABY GIRL gained the lead along the inner rail mid way on the turn, went clear approaching the stretch and gave way grudgingly. FINALJUMP
raced along the inner rail on the turn and rallied midly. VIROLOGIST , caught in tight quarters after bumping with GET LOADED leaving the starting gate,
chased the pace three wide around the turn and weakened. GET LOADED , in tight quarters after bumping with VIROLOGIST leaving the starting gate,
raced in the two path on the turn and was no factor. TITIAN TYRANT , three wide on the turn, was no factor. QUALITY WEEKEND sped to the early lead,
raced in the two path on the turn, was fanned three wide entering the stretch and faltered. FORTUITOUS drifted wide leaving the turn and was eased.
