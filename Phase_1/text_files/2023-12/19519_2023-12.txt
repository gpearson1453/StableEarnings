squeezed at the start, slow into stride, ran on strongly to the far turn and stretch to just miss in a game effort. HUSH OF A STORM raced along evenly with
no response when needed and settled for show spot. LIKE THE KING inside trip to far turn with no room, angled out with no gain in lane. KITODAN never
factored throughout. TIZ THE BOMB no speed throughout with little response when needed. LEAVE IT TO KITTEN three wide into first turn while evenly to
far turn and never a threat. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE chased pace to the half with a steady decline from the far turn and stretch run.
