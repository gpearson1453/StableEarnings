SONG RUNNER raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole, kicked clear and
held that margin to the finish. GROUP HUG bumped with the horse to her outside at the start, raced off the pace early, came around the turn in the three
path, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground late. DISCREET DEVIL led the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and weakened
in the final furlong. SENTIR ZULIANO bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader up the backstretch, navigated the
turn from the two path and faded in the lane. GREENPOINT hit the gate at the break, raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter, trailed
the field from the two path around the turn and showed no kick. EL GUAPO raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to
the four path coming around the turn and flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
UNCAPTURED WARRIOR stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, edged clear with a furlong to go and
held off a late closer at the wire. BARFLY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the two path,
began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground steadily to the finish. STAR KANOO led the way on the inside early, saved ground around the bend, dueled
in upper stretch, gave way late and kept on to the wire. JERSEY GREGG veered out and bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled off
the pace for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and improved position in the stretch. COMMANDER BIZ raced in the middle of
the pack on the outside through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the three path and showed no kick. EL GABRIELO raced in the middle of the
pack between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and made no bid. RAMBO'S RETURN trailed well behind the field up the
backstretch, saved ground around the bend and was never a factor. BLACK ECHO bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to
chase the leader up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the turn and continued to tire from there.
