Footnotes
RASTAMAN VIBE tucked inside early giving chase, hugged the rail to the stretch, roused at the top of the lane but got boxed in, found an opening along the
inside midstretch and drove past outer rivals. GUY NAMED JOE threw his head and hit the gate, traveled two wide then moved inside racing at the back,
drew closer in the middle stages, angled out into the lane, rallied and got up for second. BANDWAGON stalked three deep, pushed on through the far turn
still in the three path, challenged midstretch but got outkicked. LET SEAMUS GO forwardly placed three deep on the clubhouse turn, applied pressure from
outside on the backstretch, fought outside the lead into the final furlong, took over at the sixteenth pole but was outkicked in the end. POTENTIAL SPAM
settled inside then had to steady into the first turn, traveled along the inside, moved off the rail and went two wide into the far turn, spun four wide into the
lane and came with a mild late bid. SINE QUA NON was off slow to begin, raced three wide or outside a rival on the first turn, trailed into the second bend,
got forced out into the stretch, had the rider lose his whip in the lane, still showed a mild rally to gain late, dismounted on the backstretch following the race
and walked into the van. ARIO broke a step slow, got bumped and put in tight early, stalked keenly along the inside into the first turn, tipped two wide
leaving the second bend, got boxed in upper stretch and finished willingly. MAXIMUM CAPACITY sped clear from inside, took pressure on the backstretch,
maintained a short lead around the far turn and into the stretch, battled into the final furlong, lost command at the sixteenth pole and weakened late. BOLT
AT MIDNIGHT off slow in the beginning, saved ground through both turns and kept trying through the lane while unable to threaten. TRACKER tracked in
the two path, three deep at the quarter pole, brushed with inner rival at the eight pole and could not rally. NESSO'S LASTHARRAH raced up close between
rivals early then dropped back a bit to give chase still between foes, found traffic at the eighth pole and could not rally after. WHEN HEROES FLY raced two
wide near the back, traveled outside a rival on the far turn, swung out into the lane, moved back inward in upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
ALMENDARES (GB) brushed with inner rival at the start, reserved in the early going outside a rival, angled four wide around the far turn, drew alongside the
leaders at the sixteenth pole and edged away. ALIGATO sat off the pace in the two path, rounded the bend two to three wide, angled out in upper stretch
and finished well to gain the place. CROSBY BEACH brushed with inner rival at the start, tracked in the two path, moved into range on the far turn, rallied
under left handed urging in the lane, fought between rivals into deep stretch and got outkicked. GOLIAD dueled briefly with inner rival three wide into the first
turn, cleared and angled over to the rail, opened up a comfortable lead in the middle stages, remained unchallenged into the lane, showed the way into the
final furlong with diminishing lead and yielded in the final sixteenth. IRIDEO (ARG) unhurried from inside, tipped out and split foes in upper stretch and
missed a minor award. CASTLE LEOCH brushed leaving the gate, settled along the inside, tipped two wide on the far turn and lacked a bid in the stretch.
VANTASTIC traveled on the inside at the back, moved out in the stretch and never threatened. SHARP AZA TACK dueled briefly from inside before ceding
command on the first turn, closest in pursuit up the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn and weakened. INDIAN PEAK brushed at the start, raced
outside a rival at the back, rounded the far turn three to four wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
QUINCY MARKET brushed between rivals at the start, chased off the pace, made progress three to four wide on the turn, drifted into the back of rival and
clipped heels but only bobbled a bit, closed in on the leader in deep stretch, overtook MEMES and held over BRING HIM HOME at the wire. BRING HIM
HOME trailed early, went two wide into the turn, spun three wide into the lane, angled out and closed well from outside but ran out of time. MEMES brushed
with inner rival at the start, vied three deep, cleared past the quarter pole, drifted to the rail despite left handed urging, led clear into deep stretch but was run
down by the top pair. FIFTY CINCO broke out, vied between rivals into and around the bend, could not kick on with MEMES past the quarter pole, chased
two wide into the lane, came out a bit in upper stretch and weakened. THE GIANTS CANDY bobbled leaving the gate, went up to challenge for the lead
inside a pair of rivals, lost touch with MEMES past the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. SPEED OF THE NILE raced along the inside off the pace,
drifted out in upper stretch and was not persevered with. LEVON lost his path shortly after the start, raced in second flight five wide into the turn, trailed four
wide into the lane and came up empty.

STAY HOT settled outside a pair of rivals at the back, continued three deep into the far turn, swung widest into the lane, rallied from the middle of the stretch
and bested ROTHSCHILD and MIRACLE MARK in deep stretch. ROTHSCHILD unhurried on the inside early, drew closer up the backstretch, had to wait
when boxed in through the far turn, roused when gaining an opening entering the lane, launched a bid from the fence, took over midstretch but got outkicked
by the winner. MIRACLE MARK rated on the fence early, stalked two wide into the second bend, tipped out entering the stretch, launched a bid outside
CHARGE FOR GOLD, fought between rivals in the final sixteenth but was also outkicked. LORD BULLINGDON traveled between rivals at the rear, angled
four wide into the stretch, lacked room and had to alter back toward the inside at the top of the lane, summoned a mild rally and earned a minor award.
CHARGE FOR GOLD dueled outside INVINCIBLE through both turns, held a short lead three wide into the stretch, lost command midstretch and
weakened. DEADPAN sat off the pace outside a rival, chased three wide into the far turn, came under a ride and angled out to leave that bend in the five
path but flattened in the stretch run. ALWAYS ON CAY stalked keenly in hand from the two path early, drew alongside the top pair at the half-mile pole,
stayed alongside through the far turn, spun four wide into the lane and weakened. INVINCIBLE dueled inside CHARGE FOR GOLD for command, battled
two wide into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. JUST A GUESS tucked inside racing at the back early, trailed into the stretch and had little left for
the drive.

Footnotes
EXPRESS LINE set the pace outside SHARPAZANO early, failed to shake loose from that rival up the backstretch, dueled around the turn, maintained a
short lead through the stretch and held gamely to the line. SHARPAZANO pressed the pace from inside, headed EXPRESS LINE on the turn, dueled into
and down the lane and finished gamely in defeat. BOWTIE BOYS forwardly placed in the early going, rounded the bend three then four wide, finished
willingly under right then left handed urging but lacked the needed late punch to get by the top pair. LAST CALL PAUL stalked wide up the backstretch,
rounded the bend four to five wide and lacked a bid. AMBIGUOUS chased from off the pace along the rail into the turn, eased out and came three wide into
the lane, moved further out in the drive and failed to menace. LETTHELIQUORTALK got bumped by outer rival at the start, chased near the inside into the
turn, came under a ride around the bend and and weakened in the final furlong. RIGHT IN FRONT broke a step slow, lacked early speed, raced wide
around the turn and was not a factor. VERITAS AEQUITAS broke in and bumped rival, traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, went three wide into the
turn, came five wide into the lane and weakened. MY MO JOE off slow in the beginning, raced near the back four wide into the turn, angled in around the
bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
SURGE CAPACITY came in sharply at the start, settled inside, drew closer in the middle stages, continued to save ground on the far turn, ran into traffic
behind GRACELUND GRAY in upper stretch, snuck through along the fence at the eight pole, surged late and edged FLUFFY SOCKS in the closing
moments. FLUFFY SOCKS traveled three deep at the back, advanced while angling out to the five path on the far turn, stormed to the front with a sixteenth
remaining but got outclosed SURGE CAPACITY late. BEAUTE CACHEE (FR) stalked in the two path then near the inside, coaxed along into the far turn,
chased two wide into the lane, bumped with inner rival in upper stretch, angled out in the furlong grounds and rallied for the show. WHITEBEAM (GB) rated
in the two path, drew alongside the leader with three furlongs remaining, dueled into the lane, took over in upper stretch, put away inner rival midstretch but
was soon overtaken with a sixteenth left to run and flattened to third. RUBY NELL tracked two wide into the first turn then moved out to the four path, was on
the move outside rivals around the second bend, raced in the four path turning for home, finished willingly but was outkicked in deep stretch. CLOSING
REMARKS unhurried early on and moved into the two path, continued two wide to the stretch, steered to the inside bothering a rival in upper stretch and
kept on to improve position. ELM DRIVE stalked four then three wide on the clubhouse turn, took aim and asked three wide entering the stretch but flattened
out in the late stages. GRACELUND GRAY stepped to the front and moved inside, pressured from outside into the far turn, dueled into the lane, lost
command in upper stretch and weakened. QUEEN GODDESS steadied between rivals on the clubhouse turn, tracked out of range off the rail, rounded the
far turn three deep and lacked a response when called upon. HAMWOOD FLIER (IRE) forwardly placed in the early going on the inside, chased a bit off the
rail into the drive, bumped with outer rival in upper stretch and weakened. WAKANAKA (IRE) tossed her head leaving the gate and dropped back to last,
steered to the inside, came off the rail and trailed four wide into the lane, moved out further in the stretch and was not a factor. ELOUNDA QUEEN (IRE) off
slow to begin, traveled along the rail towards the rear, steadied in tight at the eighth pole and never made an impact.

BOSSY BRUIN GAL chased off the pace early then moved into range between rivals up the backstretch, chased two wide into the lane, bid inside the
leaders and took over in upper stretch, then drew clear in the final sixteenth. MISS WORLD PEACE chased off the inside, driven five wide into the lane,
challenged in upper stretch, outkicked by the winner in the furlong grounds and stayed on to secure second. SCREAMING VIRGINIA broke a step slow,
traveled off the pace early, came six wide into the drive, finished willingly from the middle portion of the track but could not get by MISS WORLD PEACE for
second. DREAMING OF HOPE stalked three deep into the turn, challenged from outside around the bend, dueled four wide into the lane and flattened in
the late stages. I WANT RUFFLES sat off the pace up the backstretch, rounded the bend two then three wide, found the rail in the lane and lacked a rally.
IFUAINTFIRSTURLAST trailed into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the lane and failed to menace. CAPO SORELLA closest in pursuit up the
backstretch, challenged from outside into the turn, put away CONQUEST CELSIUS at the quarter pole then fought inside DREAMING OF HOPE late on the
bend, lost command in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. CALIFORNIA CODE stalked the pace from inside into the turn, got shuffled back
behind a weakening CONQUEST CELSIUS around the bend, steered out at the top of the lane and failed to rally. CONQUEST CELSIUS had good early
speed and showed the way up the backstretch, dueled inside CAPO SORELLA on the turn, failed to keep up with that rival with a quarter mile remaining
and tired in the drive.

MIRANDA RIGHTS stalked from inside, roused leaving the far turn, challenged from inside midstretch, fought through the final sixteenth and got up late.
LEGISLATOR reserved in the early going and moved inside, went between into the far turn, chased three wide into the lane, moved out into the clear,
closed well but missed at the wire. SANTO DIOS (ARG) brushed with inner rival in the chute, rushed up while a bit keen first time through the stretch to take
control, angled over to the inside on the clubhouse turn, lost command approaching the seven-sixteenths pole, re-bid between rivals in upper stretch, led in
the final sixteenth but was outfinished by rivals on both sides late. IRISH PROPHET forwardly placed two wide early, traveled three deep up the backstretch,
spun three wide into the lane, challenged in upper stretch but was outkicked in the late stages. X J RASCAL (IRE) brushed with outer rival in the chute and
became a bit rank early, traveled off the pace three deep around the clubhouse turn, rushed up from outside at the half-mile pole, cleared near the
seven-sixteenths marker, showed the way a bit off the rail into the drive, challenged from outside in upper stretch, clung to a short lead with a furlong left to
run, relinquished the lead approaching deep stretch and weakened late. HULA CANDY was antsy in the gate then hopped at the start, angled over to the
two path then traveled outside a rival near the back, remained two wide into the lane, lacked room from upper to midstretch, tipped out with a sixteenth
remaining and put in a late run but could not threaten. HAWKER stalked two wide then between rivals, raced three deep and between rivals into the far turn,
got shuffled back a bit when crowded on the far turn, spun three wide into the drive and lacked a rally. MALTESE FALCON (IRE) broke out a step slow,
steered over to the rail early, swung five wide leaving the far turn and failed to threaten. SHORTMAN broke a step slow, tucked inside towards the rear,
coaxed along on the far turn, put to right handed urging in the drive but lacked a rally. LIL NAS stumbled to the front out of the gate, showed early speed
then was overtaken first time through the stretch, remained close up on the inside but got put in a bit tight by the leader on the clubhouse turn, shifted out to
the two path to give chase, went between rivals into the far turn, traveled two wide into the lane and weakened. LAHAINA FLAVOR settled in the two path,
traveled three deep on the backstretch, went three then four wide on the far turn and could not rally. DR. SOULFIRE forwardly placed seven deep leaving
the chute, angled over into the three path for the clubhouse turn, went four deep around the far turn and weakened down the lane.
