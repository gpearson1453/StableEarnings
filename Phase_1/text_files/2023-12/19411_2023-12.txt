DIVINE FASHION stalked inside then picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, took the nod leaving the far turn and dueled clear inside the
sixteenth pole. BETCHA BY GOLLY took the lead approaching the three quarter pole, moved inward and rated the early pace off the rail, came under
pressure leaving the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn, was met entering the lane and relented mid-stretch while maintaining second. A LITTLE
BIT CRAZY saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, angled out entering the stretch and
finished evenly. SHERIFF'S KID raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and ran
evenly in the stretch. SECRET CASTLE raced off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about

Footnotes
PRINCESS HALO stalked inside then bid approaching the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep midway on the far turn and dug in determinedly to eke
out the nod over the game stretch effort of IMINCHARGENOW, who took over at the three quarter pole and rated the pace inside, came under pressure
toward the three eighths pole, was met at the rail midway on the far turn but dug in gamely to the wire. I SHALLBE RELEASED raced off the pace about the
three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, eased out leaving the turn and dueled through the
stretch for third. JUST HAVE FAITH raced well off the early pace about the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the seven path on the far
turn and passed some rivals outside. ABUNDANT STORY raced in tight quarters approaching the first turn then stalked off the rail through the turn, gave
chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened in the lane. KEY TO THE CASTLE raced in the five path the first turn,
left the turn outside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and flattened in the lane. ODINA raced in tight
quarters approaching the opening turn then stalked from the three path, gave chase passing the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn.
DEREKA'S BLUFF raced in the five path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. LAURA'S GRAND rounded the opening turn
about the four path and was through after a half mile.

PLAYING FOR TWO tapered in and contested a pressured pace two deep through the backstretch, dueled clear approaching the head of the lane, was
steadily handled in the upper stretch then taken in hand the final sixteenth. S S CASINO GIRL pressured the pace while in tight quarters at the rail, eased
out leaving the turn and settled for second best. UNALTERED pressured the pace through the backstretch, raced close in the three path on the turn,
flattened late stretch but held on for third. MSSNAP chased the pace then steadied approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn near the rail,
eased out leaving the turn and showed little in the lane. PALACIO chased through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn and flattened in the lane.
COLD CASH gave chase outside and raced wide on the turn. CREME DE LA QUEEN chased, entered the turn off the rail then drifted approaching the head
of the lane. GATTOLOTTASPARKLE was not a factor. The Stewards reviewed then rejected a claim of foul against the rider of Playing For Two for alleged
interference through the backstretch, lodged by the rider of S S Casino Girl.

Footnotes
DAPHNE'S FIRE steadied leaving the gate then pressed the pace inside, contested even terms at the rail on the turn, dug in with the lead leaving the turn
and held on well. MIDNIGHT PASS was hustled to the lead past the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, contested even terms two deep on the turn,
dug in under steady stretch handling and just lasted for second. TOUGH ENOUGH gave chase through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn, dug in
to take the nod for third under the wire and just missed second. GREAT DEVOTION gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and
was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. HONEYCAMP gave chase, rounded the turn in the four path and ran evenly in the lane. GOLDEN BLOSSOM
chased through the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn and weakened in the lane. HERECOMES SCARLETT chased outside, raced in the six
path on the turn and passed some rivals outside. HANNAHS RED RUBY was unprepared for the break, gave chase and raced in the four path on the turn.
HOLY HIP chased, raced near the rail on the turn and weakened.
