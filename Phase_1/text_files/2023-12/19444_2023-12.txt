Footnotes
HOLUS BOLUS prompted the early pace off the inside, moved up to duel through the turn in the two path, disposed of the other speed into the lane, drew
out through the lane under steady handling. RYNO WRECKER broke on top, set the early pace while moving toward the inside, dueled with the winner turn,
could not match strides with that one through the lane, held sway late for the place. GOD'S COUNTRY forwardly placed while racing three wide, set down
for the drive, slowly getting to the runner up without posing a threat to the winner. SECRET STRATEGY went one paced in the two path in lacking a closing
response. DEVILS FORK lacked early foot, angled out four wide turning for home, improved position without posing a serious threat. BIG ANDY MORT
back off the pace well out in the stretch, swung five wide out of ,the turn, picked off a couple of rivals as well while also not a real threat. ALL GREEN
LIGHTS in the second flight outside, tired while continuing 4w. ABBY'S ENCORE fractious in the gate prior to the start, raced back, passed tiring rivals.
HELLO MR COPELAND rank, bumped at the break, moved up and settled in mid pack, just off the inside, had little for the drive. BET ALL THE GOLD broke
out and a bit slowly, remained back. CRIME ZONE raced three wide most of the way, lacked a rally. SUNDAY SPIRIT bit rank at the break, moved up up

CLUB back off the pace and the inside, four wide through the turn when launching a mild rally, along for the show. GALACTIC EMPIRE void of speed after
breaking a step slow, saved ground while racing in hand, continued to race along the rail into the lane, improved position. EASY BIG BOY settled off the
pace inside, had little for the drive. HALLOW POINT raced in mid pack toward the inside, made little through the stretch. WARHORSE WEST four wide into
the turn when within striking distance outside, three wide exiting, tired. ROMAN GIANT broke near the back and was never a factor. CITRUS BAY failed to
menace with a three wide trip. THAT KHENNY void of speed, swung six wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally when remaining well back. MO
CHOCTAW pressed the issue early, stopped through the lane, distanced after losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
SEARCY broke on top, settled off the leaders and the inside, advanced to challenge in the second turn, long, spirited duel, gained the nod to narrowly
prevail. GOLDBRICK took control soon after the start, showed the way inside, continued to set the pace the middle half, responded when challenged by the
winner in the second turn, long drive to the wire, missed. GOTTA HAVE DREAMS broke with the field, remained in mid pack for five furlongs, floated three
wide into the lane, mild rally to be clear for the show, no threat to the top two. RUN JALEN RUN within striking distance along the inside, moved out a bit
turning for home, lacked a closing response. FAMOUS FINAL SCENE off a step slow, moved up to mid pack, four wide out of the final turn, failed to muster
a closing response. RIVETAGE void of early foot, lodged a mild middle move to improve position the third quarter, flattened out in the drive. NORTHERN
CHILL began to tire after a half. RIDE FOR SUL off a step slow, saved ground to no avail. DAILY GRIND off a step slow, four wide through both turns,
remained back. DROBNY flashed brief speed and was finished after a half.

Footnotes
SILVER ROSE close from the start outside, pressed four wide through the turn, extended stretch run, firm handling, proved narrowly best in a determined
effort. CRUISE MISSILE with the pace, vied between rivals and inside the winner the final quarter mile, outkicked by that one while edging clear for the
place,. PRINCESS IS OLIVIA broke sharp, set the pace toward but not on the inside, raced on equal terms with the top two upper stretch, weakened a bit,
comfortably held the show. WHAT'S HER NUMBER broke back, raced in some traffic late in the turn, four wide into the stretch, staged a mild rally to
improve position. HAPPY N SMILING settled off the pace along the inside, came up empty when called on for the drive. COPPERDROP in mid pack off the
rail, moved toward the inside late in the turn, traffic entering the stretch, lacked rally when clear. PEPPERS GIRLFRIEND off a step slow, improved position
after racing three wide through the turn. RED VOLTA broke with the field, four wide through the turn when off the pace, lacked little in the way of a rally in
the drive. THUNDERSTRIKE four wide through the turn, also remained back in failing to respond. CATTY CRUISE failed to menace while saving ground.
TEXAS SEQUOIA off slow, trailed most of the way to be always outrun. SHE'S NOT A JOKE in the second flight for a half, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
TEJANO TWIST last to leave, continued to lag for three furlongs, began toward advance toward the inside by midway on the turn, swung out five wide when
gearing up for the stretch run, finished full of run outside to win going away in a sharp effort. NECKER ISLAND in the second flight between horses, in some
traffic late in the turn and into the lane, tipped out a bit for room a furlong out, finished willingly to earn the place, no threat to the winner. SIR WELLINGTON
broke well, vied up front in the three path, narrowly showed the way into the lane, offered little resistance to the winner the final furlong, caught for the place,
all out to salvage the show. OSBOURNE in the second flight inside, moved out for room behind a tiring leader into the lane, improved a bit late while gaining
for the show spot. RYVIT set or forced the pace up front along the inside, weakened in the final furlong. CADDO RIVER behind the pace, moved closer
three to four wide late in the turn, flattened out in the drive. ULTIMATE lacked speed, swung out to be five to six wide turning for home, in a striking position
past the furlong marker, flattened out. TOP GUNNER narrowly set the early pace along the inside, gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BILLY JACK broke sharp, chased the leader into the turn, continued to pursue through the bend, roused, late push to be up in time. TEE BURNS broke out
but alertly, straightened to set the pace, given a breather under loose restraint through the turn, remained in front past the furlong marker, nailed in the late
going. PLAUSIBLE DENILE behind the pace inside, continued to save ground turn, shifted out when straightened for home, made a late run to annex the
show and while getting to the runner up. UNDERHILL'S TAB broke out to bother an outer rival, lacked pace for a half, improved position through in some
traffic. B SUDD in the second flight along the inside, roused, had little left for the late going. MEGAN'S HONOR in mid pack while between horses, lacked a
closing kick. MANTA REY fell back to trail after the start, remained in the rear through the turn, picked off some tiring rivals after the issue had been
decided. HAPPY DANCER tired after a five wide trip. CIRCLE BACK JACK remained always back. REEF'S DESTINY was never a factor. HALMSTAD
bothered at the break to be off slowly, was used to move up to the second flight, gave way after a half.

MIKEALICIOUS unhurried early, moved out, four wide rally, finished willingly to be up in time. ORANGE DIABLO in the second flight while between horses,
roused for the drive, displayed some late interest to be up for the place. SPEEDTAIL broke with leaders, took command into the first turn, set the pace while
racing off the inside, shook well clear, faltered late when failing to contain the top two. IMPERIAL GUN broke well, lagged well back in trailing, picked way
through traffic in the second turn, continued mildly to the finish through the short stretch run. TORNADO ROAD settled off the pace in mid pack, three then
was floated out four wide into the lane, went evenly to the wire. PENROD made an early move to head up the second flight before a half, chased into the far
turn, begin to give way soon afrter. GOLDEN PLATE was never involved in remaining always back. DUTCH MILLS lacked speed, gave way in the far turn
while well wide, far back at the wire. COMMANDER STORM finished early, distanced after losing contact with the field in the stretch. TWIRLING TROILLET
in the second group inside, stopped turning for home, distanced while also losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
BUTTERBEAN unhurried in the early going, advanced four to five wide through the second turn, continued with good energy to the wire to be up in time
while well out in the strip. MISTY VEIL off the pace along the inside, continued to save ground backstretch, squeezed through along the rail though much of
the final turn, rail bid into the stretch, took over, could not contain the winner. ICE ORCHID lacked early foot outside, four wide first turn, continued outside,
four wide through the second turn, lodged a mild bid a furlong out, flattened out a bit in the late going. EFFORTLESSLYELGANT prompted the pace just off
the inside, in the two path up the backstretch when still forward, came in entering the far turn, causing LOVELY RIDE to check up in tight quarters, put a
head in front then weakened gradually through the lane. ADALINE JULIA one paced while within striking distance, three wide far turn, lacked a closing
punch in the drive. COASTAL CHARM dueled up front while racing off the inside, gave way in the second turn. BIG BAD DIVA off step slow, trailed for five
furlongs, passed some tiring foes to improve position, not a serious threat. LOVELY RIDE in the second flight, crept a bit closer late backstretch between
horses, was jammed when EFFORTLESSLYELGANT came in a bit, checked up and fell back to lose all chance. CHARLEE MAE in mid pack off the inside,
steadied behind a troubled LOVELY RIDE in traffic into the far turn, also fell back. CHARLIZE settled of the pace, altered course into the far turn behind that
incident in traffic, fell back soon after and trailed home. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF LOVELY RIDE AGAINST MISTY VEIL FOR
INTERFERENCE INTO THE FAR TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE SAME INCIDENT,
EFFORTLESSLYELGANT WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED EIGHTH.

Footnotes
SPEND BENJAMINS lacked speed, three wide turn when beginning to advance, good late course on the outside to be up in time. BOHEMIAN BO broke
alertly, set the pace along the inside, shook well clear in upper stretch, shortened strides, could not contain the winner, saved the place. GUNFLASH in mid
pack well out in the strip, four path through the turn, rallied belatedly, getting to the runner up late. W W SCOUT'S HONOR went one paced in the second
flight in lacking a winning response. HEY EUGENE three to four wide in the second flight through the turn, chased the leader upper stretch, faltered late. ST
ANDREWS broke well back, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve a bit. AFFABLE MONARCH lacked speed, made a mild advance in the
turn then failed to sustain that effort through the lane. CYCLONE last away, trailed throughout, passed tiring rivals. BOLT FORTY FIVE chased the runner
up for a half, gave way. IGNITIS had nothing for the drive. LAMUTANAATTY settled in mid pack, backed up through the stretch. DON'T WAIT UP forwardly
placed for three furlongs, gave way along the rail.
