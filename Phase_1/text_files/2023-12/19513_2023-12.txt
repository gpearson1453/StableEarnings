Footnotes
DWELLING LEGACY prompted the pace outside QUEEN OF HEARTS, secured command leaving the turn then gradually drew out under steady handling.
K KAKE POP , rank and steadied for much of the run down the backstretch, rated behind horses on the turn, eased out entering the stretch, moved up to
the eighth pole then flattened out. CONCRETE FAZE , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on the turn and through the
stretch and closed nicely. AMIE'S SYMPHONY , caught in tight quarters at the break, saved ground on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and brushed
with MY SUGAR BOO approaching the eighth pole and finished willingly. TIZ VINNO veered out leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three wide, chased
the pace and weakened. MY SUGAR BOO raced in the two path on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, brushed in mid stretch and was not a late factor.
QUEEN OF HEARTS set a pressured pace along the rail, drifted out entering the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
HAPPY UNION was away last after acting up a bit as the gates sprung, recovered and settled towards the back of the pack, commenced a rail run leaving
the far turn, eased out into the lane, worked between rivals leaving the furlong grounds, dropped back in, sustained under pressure to take over leaving the
sixteenth marker, kicked clear and was taken in hand for the final jumps. PLEASE MARRY ME was sent clear early, set the pace just off the inside,
wandered out to about the four path entering the lane, corrected and maintained a clear advantage under a drive in mid stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth
pole, ceded to the winner soon after but kept on with good effort to preserve the place. PROPER STORM secured the inside early on and settled,
responded to coaxing and picked things up leaving the five sixteenths, remained inside into and through the lane and churned on. MYSISTERNANCY ,
taken to rate inside while stalking, eased out under pressure to take closer order past the five sixteenths, was fanned five wide into the lane, straightened
and gave willing pursuit to the sixteenth pole then faded. MISQUILLO , off the pace, saved ground into the lane, moved up a bit in mid stretch, came out late
but lacked a solid finish. ONE LAS OLAS lagged back, was removed from the rail and failed to respond. THENCOMEMORNING , three deep early, chased
outside a rival leaving the three eighths and weakened. MISS FUSSY PANTS , between rivals stalking the early pace, tired mid way on the final turn. SUZY
Q THE QUEEN , mid pack early on, raced three wide leaving the three eighths, angled seven to eight wide for the drive and faded. COAL MINE stalked in
the clear early on, was under pressure three wide past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on entering the lane and faltered.

BRYSONS OPTION stalked the pace outside MALIBU'S BOSS MAN down the backstretch, overtook that one entering the far turn, was near the inner rail
there after and held sway under urging. ROCKET NIGHT lacked speed, moved up a bit along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the turn, took aim on the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. GLASS OF COURAGE , forced in after bumping with GET LIKE MIKE leaving the
starting gate, circled foes three wide on the first turn, steadied on a rival's heels leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, eased out entering
the stretch and lacked the necessary rally. MALIBU'S BOSS MAN , three deep entering the first turn, moved to the inner rail after sprinting clear entering the
backstretch, remained along the rail, lost the lead into the far turn and tired in the stretch. STARLIFTER gave way leaving the backstretch. GET LIKE MIKE
bumped with GLASS OF COURAGE at the break, chased the pace outside foes, drifted out on the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
BOB MARCO eagerly moved out to a long lead around the first turn, set the pace towards the rail and under a light hold through the backstretch run and
second turn, drifted out a bit while under left handed pressure from the three sixteenths to just past mid stretch, remained well in front past the sixteenth
marker and coasted home through the final yards. ONE TEN , well back while saving ground early on, was under a ride leaving the far turn, came out near
the five sixteenths, circled three to four wide into the lane, emerged as the closest pursuer in mid stretch and continued on willingly to bridge the gap.
SPEARGUN saved ground, was under pressure past the three eighths, gave hard chase into the lane and kept on with effort though unable to make any
real impact. WHAT DOES IT TAKE , four then three wide chasing the winner, raced between foes into the lane and gave way. MOSE PERFECT , four deep
near the half mile marker, failed to respond. LOOSE GOOSE , two wide between rivals approaching the half mile pole, came up empty. HOME SCHOOL ,
three wide between horses through the backstretch, faltered leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
BELLA BETTINA , bumped on both sides leaving the starting gate, was patiently rated behind horses to the stretch, raced in the two path through the lane,
closed inside horses and was up near the finish. WESTERN LANE raced in the two path between horses on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch
and rallied. THE HAUNTED ROOM , three deep around the turn chasing the pace, gained the lead in upper stretch, finished willingly but was not good
enough. PATTY CAKES in the three path between horses around the turn, moved to the five path in upper stretch and had a mild gain outside foes. GOLD
DIGGING BROAD bumped with the winner at the break, rushed up along the inner rail down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, drifted out in upper
stretch and weakened. LOVING CUP hugged the inner rail throughout and weakened late. ROWSIE EXPRESS came in bumping the winner at the start,
circled the turn four wide, floated to the seven path in upper stretch and failed to rally. EMIRATES AFFAIR showed speed in the two path between horses,
gave way mid way on the turn and retreated through the stretch.

RUNNING RIVER lunged a bit at the break, regrouped and was sent up to take the lead between rivals leaving the chute, set the pace towards the rail and
under a light hold, responded when set down soon into the lane, opened up in mid stretch and held sway under a drive. STEELE MONEY , off the pace
while saving ground, commenced a run leaving the far turn, angled four to five wide into the lane, straightened away and closed willingly. GAMBLING TZAR
, well back while saving ground, eased out for the drive, worked between rivals nearing mid stretch and churned on to get the show. MY MAMBA bumped
with KBCYA LATER at the break, regrouped and was unhurried early well off the pace and saving ground, made a sharp inside move mid turn, swung six to
seven wide for the drive and kept on with interest. CLOUD MUSIC broke on top, ceded to the winner leaving the chute, chased that one into and around the
turn, stayed willingly to mid stretch then weakened. RUNYONESQUE , a bit fractious in the gate, stalked outside a rival, was under a hard drive mid turn,
failed to kick on near mid stretch and faded. VAIL OF HONOR dropped well back into the turn, swung four to five wide for the drive but failed to drum up a
serious run. KBCYA LATER , bumped at the break, saved ground chasing the pace, raced in range to upper stretch then gave way. LANGLEE AVENUE ,
three wide mid turn, weakened. FOOD FOODIE was outrun.

Footnotes
WITTY , pinched back after a slow start, hugged the inner rail mid way on the turn, eased out approaching the stretch, floated to the six path in upper
stretch, swept to command under urging in mid stretch then eagerly drew away. MAGIC MULE bore out leaving the starting gate, saved ground around the
turn, was taken to the five path entering the stretch and rallied. BACKNTHEWOODS , along the inner rail chasing the pace around the turn, moved to the
three path at the head of the stretch, challenged for the lead near the eighth pole then flattened out. NORTH HIGHLAND lacked speed, was kept outside
horses around the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. OUR PRIDE N JOY was not a factor. TOP BOSS hugged the inner
rail, disputed the pace to mid stretch and tired. KADRI disputed the pace outside TOP BOSS and gave way in the drive. COMMANDING GENERAL chased
the pace, was three deep leaving the turn and gave way.

ANONYMOUSLY had speed between rivals then eased back off the leading pair into the turn, stalked under coaxing two wide mid turn, shifted three wide
into the lane, responded and surged to command a furlong out, kicked clear under a drive with a sixteenth to go then held firm while solidly hand ridden to
the wire. VIOLENT VIXEN , away alertly, drafted back off the leaders then was under a ride pursuing past the three eighths, edged up two wide past the
three sixteenths, dropped in towards the rail exiting the furlong grounds and gave game chase to the wire. SUPER RENEE broke a step slow, regrouped
and was urged along three to four wide chasing the leaders, moved up to the inside of a rival in upper stretch, came out some for the final eighth and
churned on. SWEET SHUGS grabbed command early and set the pace two wide, took pressure mid turn, dueled on a slim lead into the lane, stayed on
gamely past mid stretch then faded late. WINKED , three wide stalking the pace, was fanned five wide into the lane and came up empty. LASSIE'S NOTION
, off the pace, saved ground leaving the three eighths and failed to rally. BOURBON WILDCAT , off slow after breaking inward and brushing a rival, trailed
into and around the turn, raced between rivals in upper stretch and lacked a strong run. DETERMINED JESTER , brushed at the break, edged up and
prompted the pace along the rail, moved to engage the leader from the inside mid turn, dueled on near even terms into the stretch, stayed on to about mid
stretch then faltered.
