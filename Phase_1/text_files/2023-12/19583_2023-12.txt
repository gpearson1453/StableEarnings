Footnotes
KINETIC SKY vied for the early lead in between rivals, then dueled for the lead in the two path on the turn, made a three wide bid off the turn and was put to
a long drive, gained a short advantage by the furlong marker and then was challenged by TABEGUACHE in the furlong grounds and then win the head bob
on the wire to prove best. TABEGUACHE tracked the early pace four to three wide, then was three to two wide on the far turn, angled out for racing room in
the lane and made a bid, went on even terms late for command but lost the head bob on the wire to just miss. BEACHWALKER chased the early pace on
the inside, saved ground on the turn, then finished well on the inside but needed more late. WINIT vied for the lead on the inside, then dueled for the lead on
the inside on the turn with the winner, came two wide off the turn and faded late. FILM STAR prompted the pace three wide, made a four wide bid by the
quarter pole but then came up empty the final furlong. UNBRIDLED BOMBER chased the pace on the outside and tired.

Footnotes
JUST KATHERINE was well rated three wide, made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, took over and drew clear under mild right handed crop urging
to prove much the best. TONED UP was reserved early towards the inside, three wide by the quarter pole, shifted out and finished well on the outside to be
second best. CRYPTO MAMA set a pressured pace on the inside, then was headed by the quarter pole and weakened the final furl;ong. INTO HAPPINESS
pressed the pace two wide, went up to go on even terms by the three eighths marker and then was sent down three wide by the quarter pole but came up
empty. AMANDA'S FOLLY tracked the early pace on the inside, then shifted out to be three to two wide on the backstretch, but tired.

flattened out in the lane while staying on to be clearly second best. QUICK HAMMER tracked the early pace, two to three wide on the turn, came five wide

Footnotes
FINGAL'S CAVE showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, drifted out
through to the sixteenth marker while drawing clear to the finish. VENTI VALENTINE chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one, ran on to secure the place honors. CAIRO SUGAR chased just off the
inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and improved position to
secure the show honors. BUSTIN BAY chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, weakened
in the late stages. KNOW IT ALL AUDREY chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four then three wide for home and weakened. SWEETIE chased three then two wide coming under coaxing three
furlongs from home, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BORNFORGREATNESS stalked the early pace from the outside, made a five wide on the turn to vie for command, then slowly edged clear in the final
furlong to prove best under a drive. SONG OF SOLOMINI vied for the lead in between rivals, then was inside a duo on the turn in the three path, then
continued on to the furlong marker and ran on but was out-kicked by the winner while staying on for the place award. DAME CATHERINE pressed the early
pace four wide, then vied for the lead between rivals by the quarter pole to the furlong marker but was outfinished, bested the rest. WISE CONVERSATION
tracked the pace two to three wide on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn but had no late kick. BELLS TOLLING was bumped at the start, settled
on the outside, shifted in by the five sixteenths to be three wide by the quarter pole, then improved position late. LOVE LIKE CRAZY vied for the lead on the
inside and weakened. DACTILOGRAFA tracked the early pace on the inside and weakened. MIA NIPOTINA pressed the early pace four to five wide, then
tracked the pace five wide on the turn and came seven wide off the turn and weakened. MOTHER MARY was settled early four to three wide, shifted out
leaving the five sixteenths, came eight wide off the turn and had no rally. HANDLE ON YOU was allowed to settle early on the inside, three wide by the
quarter pole and was not a threat. NICOLENA P. was settled back early and failed to menace.
