Footnotes
CASPER JUSTICE brushed with an inner rival early on, checked behind foes into the first turn while settling into midpack along the inside, took closer order
approaching the far turn, progressed in the three path and between horses into that bend, took aim on the leader while tipping to the four path entering the
lane and sustained a grinding charge to wear that one down in the late stages. CITY OF GOD dueled for the lead two wide, showed the way in the three
path into the far turn, inched free around that bend, but gave in to an outer bidder in the final furlong. SHOSHA steadied behind a rival entering the first turn
while achieving a two path stalking position, chased the clear leader from the four path around the far turn, but yielded after being floated to the five path
entering the lane, yet lasted for show between late bidders. THISPOINTINTIME steadied slightly between horses into the first turn, laid off of the pace while
tucking to the inside around that bend, improved position two wide and between horses in upper stretch, then stayed on along the inside to miss reaching
show. FAST FELIX lacked speed in the three to four path and ran on to miss reaching show. BEOCCA tracked in the three path, chased the leaders around
the far turn and trired. BIG HELLO laid off of the pace in the five path and failed to menace. JOHNNY'S MOMENT pursued from midpack in the three path
and between horses around the first turn, then failed to factor. THALBERG brushed with an outer rival soon after the start, raced at the rear in the two to six
path and made little impact. CABAR SUL dueled for the lead along the inside, but gave way nearing the three furlong pole and weakened. CHARLIES
MEDAL bobbled soon after the start, pursued from midpack in the four path and faded.

LUCKY'S SECRET vied two wide, then between horses around the turn, led while brushing with his inner counterpart entering the lane, shifted in and
bumped that foe in a more firmer manner passing the furlong grounds, then inched ahead in the closing stages. SHERWOOD AVENUE vied for the lead
inside of the eventual winner, then inside of a pair of rivals around the turn, exchanged a brush with his most immediate counterpart while headed by that
one entering the lane, took firmer contact leaving the furlong grounds, was bested late and lasted for place. LOBO SALVAJE bumped an outer rival at the
start, stalked three wide, bid and vied three deep around the turn, but failed to maintain level terms in upper stretch, sustained a chase while flopping leads
and missed place. JARED THE WARRIOR broke a step slow before being bumped by an inner rival at the start, laid behind the main group in the two path,
shifted to the four path entering the turn, tipped to the five path at the five sixteenths pole and ran on to improve position. ROBIN'S GIANT chased in the five
to four path into the turn and gave way. MUD PUDDLE chased along the inside and yielded. NIGHT CHANT chased three wide and between horses, but
faded turning for home. NO MORE GUNS broke slowly, advanced to track two wide and between horses but weakened approaching the lane. SOUPED UP
NICK took contact from an inner rival leaving the gate and was slow to recover, then showed little. FOLLOWING A TRAINER'S OBJECTION OF
SHERWOOD AVENUE AGAINST LUCKY'S SECRET FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, LUCKY'S
SECRET WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND

Footnotes
REAPPLY took closer order to track two wide and between horses, steadied off rivals heels and brushed his way to the three path entering the turn, ranged
up to take aim from the four path entering the lane, bid and gained an advantage at the furlong grounds, then held from an inner bidder through the late
stages. ENZI BOY received contact from an outer rival soon after the start, stalked forwardly in the three path, but yielded between horses at the half mile
pole, tucked and tracked along the inside around the turn, progressed to offer a rail bid inside of the new leader at the furlong grounds, but was fended off
by that one through the final sixteenth. RAISERICHIESRANSOM lacked interest in forward position leaving the chute, yet advanced inside or rivals to a
tracking position approaching the turn, took aim outside of the leader nearing the lane, but lacked a bid before yielding between challengers in upper stretch,
yet kept on mildly to claim show from a faltering foe late. TORMENTA JERRY bumped an inner rival at the start, set a clear pace around the turn, drifted out
in upper stretch and faltered three wide and between horses at the furlong grounds. MOON CHARGER was jostled between horses at the start, lacked
speed, saved ground around the turn, moved up inside of rivals entering the lane, tipped out and ran on. PAPA'S RANSOM bumped with an inner rival at
the start, raced at the rear in the three to two path around the turn and improved in upper stretch. PACIFIDERO bumped with an outer rival and was off a
step slow, raced at the rear early on, laid off of the pace five wide around the turn and failed to factor. SWAYBACK JACK transferred contact from an outer
rival to an inner foe at the start, chased three wide and between horses, but was brushed by an inner rival and gave way at the three furlong pole. KING
BUKELE made little impact four wide. WATCHNTHETIDEROLL stalked in the two path and weakened between horses nearing the lane.

Footnotes
FREE TIME tracked along the inside, pressed before vying with the leader into the far turn, drove clear entering the lane and held sway. SKIPPINJUSTICE
broke a step slow and brushed an inner rival at the start, trailed in the two path, picked up stride in the three to four path around the far turn, tipped out to the
six path in upper stretch and rallied for place. LIEUTENANT KITTY settled off of the pace, advanced two wide and between horses around the far turn and
ran on willingly. WICKED INTENT broke a step slow, lacked speed in the two path and stayed on. RECOGNIZE ME tracked in the four path, pursued the
top pair from within striking range in the three path around the far turn, got floated to the five path while bidding for place entering the lane, vied for that
position through midstretch but gave way between horses entering the final sixteenth. NORA'S STAR set the pace in the two path, vied with an inner bidder
into the far turn, but drifted out to the four path entering the lane and weakened. LUCKY SHORE stalked along the inside before tipping to the two path
around the first turn, pursued between horses down the backstretch, but failed to maintain stalking position with nine sixteenths to go, then was shuffled
behind a fading foe around the far turn and lacked a re-rally. DR. BELLA took light contact from an outer rival leaving the gates, saved ground off of the
pace and faded around the far turn. LOTTA ROSES broke inwardly, raced off of the pace in the three to four path and faded between horses entering the
lane. COLUMN stalked in the three path, chased the leading pair while tucking to the inside entering the far turn and weakened around that bend.

WHAT'S CRACKIN vied along the inside, led around the turn, drew clear approaching the quarter pole and held safely. PIN UP BETTY broke a beat slow,
laid off of the pace along the inside, swung out to the six path leaving the three furlong pole, rallied to bid for minor placings in the final furlong, forged place
while leaning inwardly towards an inner rival at the sixteenth pole, then held that position between horses. EIGHT DAYS SOBER bumped with an outer rival,
then an inner foe, at the start, pursued from midpack in the two path, steadied while keyed up behind foes passing the nine sixteenths pole, pursued from
the three to four path around the turn before fanning to the five path entering the lane, ran on to bid for place between horses entering the final sixteenth, but
was herded by an outer foe and forced to brush an inner rival while getting outkicked at that marker, recovered and ran on to sustain that bid, but missed
place. INDY'S HALO broke awkwardly and spotted the rest multiple lengths early on, moved out of last in the five path entering the turn, shifted out to the
seven path in midstretch and offered a late kick to miss reaching place. STAKEOUT tracked along the inside, gained place while tipping off the inner railing
entering the lane, chased the clear leader thereafter but was bested by outer bidders for minor positions late. SALTWATER TAFFY stalked three wide, was
urged along into the turn, chased entering the lane, yielded in upper stretch, then was brushed by an outer rival while put to tight quarters at the sixteenth
pole. CELTIC ELEGANCE pursued from midpack three wide and tired. ONDA BRAVA bumped an inner rival at the start, saved ground at the rear, shfited
out in upper stretch and surpassed tired rivals. COQUITO made little impact from the three path. JILLY'S WEST tracked two wide and between horses, but
faded turning for home. DELIGHTED vied two wide and weakened approaching the quarter pole. NOBLE MADAME tracked four wide but faded between
horses turning for home. THE RIDER OF SALTWATER TAFFY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF PIN UP BETTY FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE
FINAL FURLONG, FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
YOU'RE AVOIDING ME prompted three wide early on before being wrangled back after a quarter mile, tracked between horses, shifted in and put an inner
pair of rivals to crowded quarters entering the turn, pursued from the two path around the bend, bid up a vacated rail in upper stretch, edged an advantage
from outer rivals entering the final sixteenth and narrowly held. JUDY'S MS. OFFICER raced off of the pace two wide, but was put to crowded quarters by
an outer rival into the far turn, bumped an inner rival and steadied hard losing multiple lengths of position in the aftermath, was scrubbed upon to recover in
the three path around the turn, picked up stride fanning to the six path entering upper stretch, offered a rally to produce a late bid but just missed. BUCKEYE
ROSE stalked four wide, then three wide from the four path around the turn, bid while floated to the five path entering the lane, vied as an outer rival bid in
the late stages and missed between horses. BROADWAY BLAZE was bumped by an inner rival at the start, vied for the lead inside of a rival while
remaining a path off the rail, drifted to the three path entering the lane, sparred between horses into midstretch but yielded in the final sixteenth. WILD IRISH
vied for the lead two wide while kept in the three path around the turn, floated to the four path while an outer rival bid entering the lane and gave way
between horses in midstretch. DANSEUR D'ORO bumped an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, but was bumped and put to tight
rail quarters causing a hard steady into the turn and was outrun thereafter. FOLLOWING OBJECTIONS LODGED BY THE RIDERS OF DANSEUR D'ORO
AND JUDY'S MS. OFFICER, BOTH AGAINST YOU'RE AVOIDING ME FOR INTERFERENCE INTO THE TURN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE
ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
FIGGY tracked in the three to two path, chased between horses turning four home before tipping back three wide in upper stretch, then sustained a grinding
charge to wear down the leader at the wire. BEFRIENDED stalked along the inside, shifted to the four path and outside of the leaders leaving the first turn,
bid in the three path approaching the far turn, vied two wide around that bend, led turning for home with rider losing his whip through the stretch but failed to
kick clear in upper stretch, flopped back to her left lead entering the final sixteenth and was nailed by an outer bidder at the wire. OUR GIRL FLINT pursued
from midpack along the inside, tracked behind rivals around the far turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, rallied gradually to attempt a late bid but
came up short. ARGAN bumped with an inner rival then an outer foe at the start, vied along the inside, got headed by an outer bidder around the far turn,
then fought on through midstretch but yielded late. ROSELEE MAY took contact from an inner rival soon after the start, raced off of the pace tucking from
the four to two path around the first turn, improved along the inside to vie for show while chasing around the far turn, then lacked further progress to offer a
bid. PEACOCK ROAD saved ground well back, improved position inside of rivals turning for home, then ran on evenly behind mild traffic late. MORNING
SPLENDOR broke slowly and trailed early on, advanced in the four to five path around the far turn, but flattened out. MOTHER FREEDOM bumped with an
outer rival at the start, lacked speed two wide and made little impact. YAMMY YAMMY BELLA tracked in the four path, chased around the far turn and
weakened. WILLOWY lacked speed in the two to three path, was put to tight quarters between horses entering the lane and failed to factor. PICCANTE
raced off of the pace hung in the five path and faded around the far turn. NO LACA CHARM vied two wide, but weakened between horses nearing the far
turn and readily stopped. PER HIWU RULING 3312 FIGGY WAS DQD FOR A POSITIVE TEST

Footnotes
PEACOCK LASS was allowed to settle well back along the inside, awaited racing room around the bend, split foes launching a two wide rally entering the
lane, surged past the leader at the sixteenth pole and held sway from an outer pursuer through the late stages. PUMPKIN SCONE settled off of the pace
along the inside, shifted out turning for home, smoothly tipped to the five path in upper stretch, rallied but was outkicked by an inner bidder nearing the final
sixteenth and chased that one home to prove second best. DEVINE CHARGER stalked in the four to three path before floating back to the four path
entering the lane, sustained stride but was outkicked by rallying rivals on both sides nearing the final sixteenth and stayed on to claim show late. FILLY
CRYSTAL vied along the inside, cleared entering the lane, but was caught entering the final sixteenth and weakened. ABITIBI trailed in the five path, shifted
to the seven path in upper stretch and stayed on willingly. SECRET OPERATION bumped with an inner rival then took up from tight quarters between
horses at the start, lacked speed in the four path, moved to the six path entering the lane and ran on mildly. STORY HOUR raced off of the pace two wide
and between horses, shfited to the four path turning for home and failed to menace. FOREVER HOME vied two wide, but gave way entering the lane in the
three path and weakened between horses. RICHIES GREAT GIRL stalked in the three path and between horses, chased into the turn and gave way. SHIP
IT bumped with an inner rival before being put to crowded quarters among foes at the start, laid off of the pace three wide, entering the lane in the five path
and between horses and failed to factor. MIMAJOON tracked two wide and between horses under a firm hold early on, then weakened around the turn.
TENENBAUM stalked along the inside, chased around the turn, faded nearing the lane and caved.

Footnotes
ESME was last away, settled off of the pace in the five path, gained gradually around the far turn, then sustained progress to bid outside of the leader at the
sixteenth pole and drove past late. HONEYTOWN set the pace in the two path, held sway through midstretch but met an outer challenge entering the final
sixteenth and was grudgingly bested. JAYLA tracked along the inside, chased under urging around the far turn and ran on to be best of the rest. CAPTIVE
STAR settled at the rear two wide, advanced between horses down the backstretch, shifted from the four to six path in upper stretch, stayed on to vie for
show late and narrowly prevailed. MIKITA stalked in the thee path and between horses early on, chased around the far turn, took aim between horses in
upper stretch, but was outkicked in midstretch, yielded and lost fourth at the wire. WICKED KITTEN laid off of the pace in the two path, then in the five path
around the far turn and moved up. LAST CHANCE DANCE tugged four wide around the first turn, stalked the leader from the three path approaching the far
turn, but chased around that bend and weakened between horses in upper stretch. TOP HAT TIGRESS pursued from the four to two path and made little
impact. BELLA MORNING pursued three wide and between horses and failed to factor. MALI BALI chased from midpack in the two path,, dropped back
down the backstretch, lacked a re-rally in the six path around the far turn and made little impact. FLAT OUT FAY never got involved. SONDRAS LAST
HOPE stalked in the four path around the first turn but was done early.
