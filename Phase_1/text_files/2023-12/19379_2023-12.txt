Footnotes
HALF AGAIN was away alertly, rated along the inside under a firm hold, raced near the rail in the drive and just got up near the wire under strong handling.
HEZA PRIORITY set a pressured early pace two deep, led deep stretch and just missed in a game effort. COACH KENNY dropped back off the early pace
setters, moved up four wide around the far turn and finished willingly to the wire while racing from the far outside. RECKLESS RANSOM dropped early, hard
ridden near the three eighths pole two deep, raced four to five wide in the stretch run and was even with no closing run. SABER RUN pressed the early
leader from the outside and tired readily.

Footnotes
VORTEX dueled for the early lead near the rail and kicked clear in the drive to draw off under steady pressure. GOD GUNS N GUTS dropped back off the
early pace, swung eight wide into the upper stretch around a drifting Mo Hawk Man and rallied for the place position. BOLIVER raced mid pack early, was
two deep around the far turn, angled out five wide near the three sixteenths pole and flattened out with no closing run on the top pair. NERVY was forwardly
placed early on, split two deep near the five sixteenths pole to challenge and was empty in the drive. MO HAWK MAN duel early on from the outside of rival,
drifted through the far turn into the upper stretch and faded. SOCIAL APPEAL slow early on, saved ground and never threatened. MALIBU MONEY dropped
back early, raced from the inside around the far turn and lacked a bid.

SHOW OFF raced three to four wide around both runs, tracked the pace from the outside, hard ridden far turn and finished well to edge up strong handling.
LOVE TO EAT was sent along from the outside to set a clear early lead, dug in inside the eighth pole and gave way Show Off grudgingly. REGAL RUMOR
settled off the early pace to race in hand, swung wide into the upper stretch and was slowly gaining late in a willing effort. LIVI ME DREAMING void of early
speed, raced near the inside around the far turn, angled five wide through the stretch run and moved up. MARQUETTE WARRIOR stalked the pace along
the inside and faded. JOCASTA dropped back to race mid pack early, was five deep into the upper lane and had no response. SAVED BY GRACE stalked
the pace between rivals and faded.

MUCHO MACHO GIRL showed good early speed to set the early pace and drew off to be well clear under a steady hand ride. COEXIST dropped back off
the early pace, swung six wide into the lane and rallied for the place position to finish second best. GIRL AFRAID chased the early pace from the inside
down the backstretch around the far turn, shifted out five wide and flattened out in the drive. ROCKETS SISTER prompt the early leader two deep from the
outside of rival and faded. CARRY ON settled off the early going, raced near the inside throughout and lacked a bid. OURS AND THEIRS lag early on,
raced three deep around the far turn and never was a threat. LAST OF THE NILE stalked the pace, raced three to four wide around the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
THEROANRUNNER set an uncontested early pace, angled off the rail into the upper stretch to race well off the inside and drew to be well clear under
steady pressure. SRI LANKA tracked the early leader two deep but was no match for the winner in the drive. HAPPY CHARGER was allowed to settle early
on, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and improved position. LIFFEY broke thru gate pre-race, ran off a furlong, stalked the pace two deep and
weakened. IRISH MOLLY was slow early on, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no response. MS. LILIBET broke thru gate pre-race,
ran off into the far turn, reloaded shortly after, raced four wide into the first turn and never was a factor.

Footnotes
TOFFEE raced off the early pace, moved up four to five wide around the far turn and surged up from the outside to prove best under strong handling.
NOTABLE QUEEN pressed the early pace from the outside, led deep stretch and missed in a game effort. FIRST LOVE showed good early foot from the
inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. NOT TODAY GEEGEE was coaxed along from the inside and weakened in the drive. BANK ON IT stalked
the pace, raced three to five wide and failed to sustain a bid. SUPER CHRISTIE void of early speed, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never
threatened. PETTICOAT raced far back while losing ground and never threatened.
