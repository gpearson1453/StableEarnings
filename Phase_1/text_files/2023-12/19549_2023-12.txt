Footnotes
CALL ME FIREY stalked the pace from three wide down the backstretch then moved up to engage the leader at the quarter pole and matched strides
outside of DABOOGEYMAN to the wire and won the nod. DABOOGEYMAN was roused to a clear lead down the backstretch then was headed at the
quarter pole and matched strides inside of CALL ME FIREY to the wire and was outnodded. ALL TOGETHER prompted the pace from the inside to the final
turn then fell back but made a rebid to be up for the show. KAT'S SOLDIER raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then moved up and went
four wide at the three furlong to challenge the leader but faltered. MUSTBELIEVE saved ground around the first turn then angled out to three or four wide on
the backstretch then tipped back inside in the stretch to pass tiring rivals. MY UNCLE BILLY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside around the first
turn then made a mild bid on the backstretch but was not a threat. TAPIT TWICE raced off the pace early the dropped back.

Footnotes
KINGSWOOD pressed the pace from the two path down the backstretch then moved up to take the lead before the quarter pole and drew clear. MORO
MAFIA raced in the middle of the pack from three wide down the backstretch then tipped out to four wide around the final turn and made a late run to be up
for the place money. TIZHOTNDUSTY raced near the back around the first turn then moved up from three wide around the final turn, moving out to four
wide in upper stretch for the rally but was not enough. SIR ELI tracked the leaders from the inside through the final turn then made a late bid to improve
position. HURTS SO BAD stalked the pace from three wide to the final turn and retreated. I SEE CLEARLY NOW unhurried through the final turn, showed
late interest and passed tiring rivals. MIND ON MY MONEY saved ground, made a mild bid into the final turn but lacked room and was taken back.
OVERTAXED roused to a pressured lead to the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
RE RE'S RAINBOW pressed the pace from the two path then took the lead entering the backstretch and edged away, was unchallenged and drew off in the
stretch. SWEET REVIVAL vied for the lead from three wide but was not match for the winner and fended off the late closer to hold on for second. CUPIE
CUTIE raced off the pace on the inside, made a mild bid from the two path at the three furlong marker then moved back inside for a late rail bid and missed
the second place money. BLUERIDGEBALLERINA raced in the middle of the pack to the final turn then moved up slightly and finished evenly. WHEELS
LIKE NALA saved ground to the final turn then made a three wide bid on the final turn to improve position. GYPSY JACKPOT drifted in shortly after the start
then raced near the back around the first turn then made a mild bid on the backstretch but flattened out. TOP CON never a threat. JIVIN ASTRO remained
back. GLORIOUS GEARS went to a brief lead around the first turn then vied to the three furlong marker and gave way. SPARKLE CITY hopped out of the
starting gate then clipped heels, lost rider and walked off. STEWARD INQUIRY WAS POSTED INTO THE START OF THE RACE, AFTER A REVIEW IT
WAS DETERMINED THAT GYPSY JACKPOT INTERFERED WITH SPARKLE CITY, SO GYPSY JACKPOT WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SIXTH TO
LAST.

SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW vied for the lead from the three path before taking a brief lead at the three furlong maker but was overtaken at the three sixteenths
pole and tired. T R'S FIRST trailed the field around the first turn then steadily advanced from three wide on the backstretch for a rally. PIPPA'S PROSPECT

Footnotes
INSPECTOR ED raced in the middle of the pack from the three or four wide around the first turn then moved to the inside rail and steadily advanced on the
backstretch, angled out to three or four wide at the top of the stretch and sailed home. HEATHER'S REQUEST raced in the middle of the pack around the
first turn then rushed up to contention on the backstretch, engaged the leaders entering the final turn and matched strides with XNTHUS WRATH to deep
stretch and was a game second. XANTHUS WRATH dueled for the lead from the inside with PINK HIGGINS for the first half then matched strides with
HEATHER'S REQUEST to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. PLAY MASTER raced near the back around the first turn then moved between horses at
the quarter pole and made a late bid to improve his position. JAMAICAN ME was allowed to settle around the first turn then moved up from four wide on the
backstretch then moved out to five wide in upper stretch but was empty. MR ELVIN raced off the pace from the two path then made a four wide bid on the
final turn but lacked the late response needed. IT'S A BIRD went to the early lead for the first quarter while saving ground and retreated. MIDNIGHT
CROWN was allowed to settle and remained back. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN was unhurried and never a threat. PINK HIGGINS vied for the lead from two
wide to the three furlong maker and gave way.

strides with VERRAZANO FIRST to the wire and prevailed. VERRAZANO FIRST saved ground around the first turn then slipped through at the three furlong
marker to take the lead but was collared at the top of the stretch and dueled gamely to the wire but lost the nod. INCORRIGIBLE vied for the lead from
between horses around the first turn then lead between calls and fell back on the final turn but was able to hold on for the show. PAYDAY TOO raced four
wide down the backstretch and made a mild bid on the final turn and flattened out. APPLEWOOD raced near the back and failed to menace. TRAELEE

TENSAS BERTIE went to the front to an unchallenged lead and set all the pace to prove best. CAJUN TWO STEP raced off the pace around the first turn
then fell back slightly on the backstretch but made a rail bid through the final turn to be second best. SIMPLE SUNDAY saved ground around the first turn
then moved out the five wide at the three eighths to move around traffic, moved back inside for a late rally. MARDI GRAS ALARM was forwardly place
around the first turn then moved up to be off the pace through the final turn then floated out at the top of the stretch and was outfinished. BLESS D'SOUTH
near back down the backstretch then moved out the six wide in upper stretch for a late bid but was too late. BOSTON LUCILLE raced in the middle of the
pack from three wide and failed to menace. SHE'S TAKIN OVER raced in the middle of the pack then moved between horses at the five sixteenths pole but
failed to sustain the bid. JUST A WIN reared at the gates opened then was allowed to settle around the first turn, moved up to go between horses at the
three furlong marker but faltered. MYLIES STAR was unhurried and was always back. ELIZABETH RENEE was rushed to contention from three wide to the
final turn and dropped back.
