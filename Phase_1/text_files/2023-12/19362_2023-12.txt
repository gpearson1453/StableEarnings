Footnotes
KERRY GOLD settled in the two path, angled out and bumped rival past the quarter pole, reeled in the leader under strong handling, took over with a
sixteenth left to run and won going away. MARGOT'S BOY took control early and set the pace inside MYSTIC FLYER, shook free from that rival on the far
turn, remained clear and put to right handed urging with a furlong remaining, offered no resistance to KERRY GOLD approaching the sixteenth pole and
stayed on to hold second. WINE AND WHISKY stalked along the rail around both turns, tipped out at the top of the stretch to take aim at the leader but
finished evenly in deep stretch. NOLONGERAHOBBY trailed three then two wide on the first turn, raced along the rail into the second bend, shifted to the
two path then came back to the inside, churned on through the lane and earned a minor award. TALKLESSWORKMORE tracked in the three path early,
went four wide into the second bend, got bumped by inner rival past the quarter pole, spun five wide into the lane and lacked a bid. ANDY CAN U HEAR ME
raced up close outside the top pair three to four wide on the clubhouse turn, three deep through the far turn and weakened down the lane. MYSTIC FLYER
prompted the pace from outside in hand, ridden along to stay with the leader on the far turn but could not keep up, chased two wide into the drive, got
crowded between rivals in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
UNKEPT SECRET cleared the field to show the way up the backstretch, entered the turn on the rail, met the challenge from MISS COMMANDER past the
quarter pole and fought in the two path into the lane, maintained a short advantage into the final furlong, drifted out and made contact with MISS
COMMANDER late and held gamely to the wire. MISS COMMANDER stalked from inside, tipped out midway around the bend, launched a bid from outside
past the quarter pole, kept the pressure on UNKEPT SECRET through the lane, got floated out and bumped by that rival late and could not get by. LUCKY
VEGAS broke a step slow, stalked between then two wide into the turn, chased four wide into the lane, drifted to the rail in the final furlong and kept on to
whittle the gap late. CALIFORNIA DIVA stumbled leaving the gate, dueled briefly from outside then shifted in early and lost contact with the leader, chased
three deep to the turn, came five wide into the lane and weakened. DOOZY chased four deep early, six wide into the drive and came up empty. IPANEMA
GIRL broke well then settled at the back, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED UNKEPT SECRET FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR DRIFTING OUT LATE AND MAKING CONTACT WITH MISS COMMANDER,
COSTING THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER POSITION.

Footnotes
UNCONQUERABLE KEEN (IRE) took control quickly from inside, set the pace into and around the turn, inched away when roused in upper stretch, urged
right handed in the final sixteenth and stayed clear to the wire. TURN ON THE JETS (IRE) broke well then stalked the leader up the backstretch, rounded
the bend in the two path, closest in pursuit entering the final furlong, could not make any headway on the winner and stayed on to secure second. LANE
WAY chased along the rail to the stretch, moved out in the lane and finished willingly for the show honors. DANIEL'S MAGIC tracked the pacesetter outside
a rival, navigated the turn two wide, moved out in the lane and lacked further response. HONEY PANTS was a bit keen early and rider had to take a brief
hold early, saved ground around the bend but had to pause when put in tight at the quarter pole, looked to tip out at the top of the stretch then elected to
stay inside when DIANIEL'S MAGIC move out and lacked a rally in the late stages. JOHNNY PODRES settled early off the inside, went three wide into the
turn, turned for home in the four path and could not rally. SEE THROUGH IT chased under coaxing off the inside early, rounded the bend in the three path
and faded down the lane.

new leader past the eighth pole, drove clear outside the sixteenth pole and won going away. HARD TO FIGURE trailed up the backstretch, went two wide
into the turn, angled out and entered the lane five wide, showed a mild rally and got up for second. DISCO BALL stalked outside rivals to the turn, bid three
deep near the quarter pole, fought four wide into the stretch, inched ahead then put away inner rivals, confronted by GHOST OF MIDNIGHT past the eighth
pole, lost command approaching the sixteenth pole and was outfinished for second. JEFE DE OBRA (CHI) hit the gate to lose a step at the start, moved up
and was closest in pursuit off the inside up the backstretch, bid outside the leader into the turn, fought between rivals leaving the bend, stayed on to the
eighth pole, then weakened in the furlong grounds. GRANITIANSEVENSIX brushed by THIRSTY JOHN at the start, went up to take control from inside,
challenged from outside entering the turn, fought along the rail and carried a narrow lead into the stretch, relinquished the lead to DISCO BALL and gave
way. THIRSTY JOHN brushed inner rival leaving the gate, stalked from inside, ridden along on the turn and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
ZONA VERDE (IRE) took control from outside and crossed over once clear of inner rivals, set all the pace to the top of the lane, roused in upper stretch then
put to right handed urging at the eighth pole, responded well and remained clear to the line. LADY DE BERRY settled outside a rival near the back, moved
closer in the middle stages, angled out and traveled four deep at the quarter pole, chased within striking distance with a furlong left to run, finished willingly
through deep stretch but could not only whittle the gap on ZONA VERDE (IRE) while gaining the place. YATTA bumped inward at the start, traveled two
wide at the back on the first turn, made progress while steered out to the four path on the far turn, put in a mild late bid and earn the show honors.
ANTIFONA (FR) off slow and bothered at the start, pulled briefly from inside, trailed into the far turn, went outside a rival then angled four wide leaving the
bend, summoned a mild rally and rounded out the superfecta. MS BRIGHTSIDE (IRE) rated on the inside then pulled on the clubhouse turn, patiently ridden
still next to the fence on the second bend, cut the corner and roused into the lane, put to right then left handed urging and finished evenly late. MO FOX
GIVIN reserved in the early going and tucked inside on the first turn, dropped back to last on the second bend, tipped two wide past the quarter pole,
bumped with inner rival in upper stretch, split foes at the eight pole and kept on to improve position. SHE IS ROMANTIC broke well then chased between
rivals before becoming rank early, tracked between rivals in range up the backstretch, came under a ride on the far turn, raced three wide turning for home
and weakened. CIRCLE OF TRUST broke in and bumped rival, settled early and moved inside then pulled on the first turn, saved ground to the stretch,
tipped out and bump rival at the top of the lane, lost her path at the eighth pole and weakened. GO WITH GUSTO forwardly placed four deep and bumped
with BLUE OASIS early then went three deep into the first turn, chased the leader two wide into the backstretch, closest in pursuit to the far turn, chased
between around that bend and faded down the lane. BLUE OASIS stalked three deep between and got bumped by GO WITH GUSTO then put in tight prior
to the clubhouse turn, chased three wide then three deep around that bend, remained three wide into the stretch and also faded.

Footnotes
BETTER THAN GOLD went four then three wide around the first turn racing at the back, advanced outside rivals on the far turn, closed fast from outside
down the stretch and inhaled the dueling pair approaching the wire. IMAGINATION chased four then three deep early, closest in pursuit leaving the
backstretch, challenged from outside at the three-eighths pole, dueled into the lane, took over while getting bumped by TAPALO in upper stretch, battled
through the final furlong holding a slim advantage over inner rival but got run down by the winner from outside in the closing moments. TAPALO showed the
way around the first turn in the two path, remained clear up the backstretch, met the challenged from IMAGINATION with three furlongs left to run, battled
around the far turn, lost command while drifting out and bumping that rival in upper stretch, fought back through the furlong grounds and finished a game
third. FLIGHT WAY chased two wide into the first turn, sat off off the pace in the middle stages, ridden along on the far turn, raced near the inside into the
lane and lacked a rally. BRITISH ISLES stalked the pace from inside, dropped back on the far turn and came up empty. MISCHIEF MOMENTS chased off
the inside, lost ground up the backstretch, started to weaken on the far turn and tired. SENSE broke a step slow and never got involved. THERE WAS AN
INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN BETWEEN TAPALO AND IMAGINATION. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT TAPALO
INITIATED THE CONTACT WITH IMAGINATION AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
PROGRAM TRADING (GB) unhurried in the beginning, traveled two to three wide on the clubhouse turn, closed in around the second bend, took aim three
wide into the stretch, headed SILVER KNOTT (GB) with a furlong remaining, cleared that rival at the sixteenth pole, challenged by WEBSLINGER late and
was able to hold on. WEBSLINGER broke a bit slow and settled at the back, trailed to the far turn, on the move following PROGRAM TRADING (GB) two
then three wide, moved out in the lane, rallied under left handed encouragement, drew alongside PROGRAM TRADING (GB) late and was gaining to the
wire but ran out of time. SILVER KNOTT (GB) vied with outer rivals leaving the chute then inched ahead first time in the stretch, set the pace under pressure
from SANTORINI, dueled leaving the backstretch and far turn, maintained a short lead into the lane, put SANTORINI away at the top of the stretch but was
soon confronted by PROGRAM TRADING (GB) in upper stretch, relinquished the lead with a sixteenth to go and flattened to third. WATSONVILLE raced up
close between rivals in the chute then took a stalking position next to the rail, coaxed along on the far turn and continued to save ground to the stretch but
flattened in the late stages. SANTORINI had early speed three deep leaving the chute then prompted the pace from outside, dueled leaving the backstretch,
fought two wide through the far turn, could not keep up at the top of the stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. REIQUIST settled along the inside
early, ran up on heels first time in the stretch and had to shift out to the two path entering the first turn, ran up on heels again around that bend, chased
three deep into the far turn, got carried wide by REDISTRICTING (GB) at the five-sixteenths pole, angled back down to the inside but could not recover from
the trouble. REDISTRICTING (GB) stalked outside a rival early, three deep then four wide on the clubhouse turn, lugged out on the second bend, eased into
the lane, caught by the outrider midstretch and walked off.

Footnotes
HAVOC broke out and bumped MR. DREAMCYCLE, stalked outside a rival and went two wide into the turn, worked on while tipping four wide around the
bend, rallied from outside and overhauled the leaders late. MR. DREAMCYCLE turned his head and took a bump from HAVOC at the start, went up to press
the pace from outside, dueled on the turn, took a short lead into the final furlong, continued to battle with DES DOIGTS in deep stretch holding a slim
advantage but was run down by the winner late. DES DOIGTS broke in and brushed rival, sprinted to the front then set the pace with MR. DREAMCYCLE to
the outside, dueled with that rival around the bend, lost command in upper stretch but fought back gamely from inside to the wire. SALSATION raced up
close outside the top pair, lost contact with those rivals on the turn and chased three in the three path to the stretch, got brushed by ELIGIO at the eighth
pole, then came again late but was not enough. HANDSOME HARRY chased outside a rival at the back, went four wide into the turn, spun five wide into the
lane and needed to find more late. GENTLEMEN'S CLUB got brushed leaving the gate, chased two wide into the turn, steered out and exited the bend five
wide and summoned a mild response to close the gap late. ELIGIO got bumped between rivals leaving the gate, chased along the rail then two wide into
lane, came out and brushed SALSATION at the eighth pole and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GHOST (GB) stalked off the rail then dove down to the rail for the clubhouse turn, rated in hand in the middle stages, cut the corner into the lane,
challenged from inside in upper stretch and drove clear. EVERYTHING BUGS ME bumped leaving the gate, closest in the two path early, applied pressure
in the middle stages, chased three deep into the far turn, re-bid three wide at the quarter pole, could not match strides with GOLDEN GHOST (GB) in the
furlong grounds but finished willingly for second. VISUALLY bumped with EVERYTHING BUGS ME at the start, sped clear and showed the way along the
inside early, pressured from outside up the backstretch, cleared briefly on the far turn, confronted again at the quarter pole, led two wide into the lane, lost
command in upper stretch and flattened to third. POPPY'S JOY chased two then three wide early, bumped with inner rival and got put in tight while three
deep and between foes approaching the half-mile pole, chased three wide into the lane and kept on to round out the superfecta. SEA DANCER chased
along the rail into the first turn then became rank around the bend, saved ground then came two wide into the drive and was outkicked by POPPY'S JOY for
a minor award. ENGLISH DANGER tucked inside at the back, ridden along while gaining ground through the far turn, got to within range entering the final
furlong but flattened out. KETONIA (FR) came away slow, rushed up and had to steady into the first turn, pulled between rivals, bumped with outer rival past
the nine-sixteenths pole, challenged between rivals at the three-eighths pole, chased two wide into the lane and weakened. PINK WHITNEY coaxed from
the gate then steadied a bit early and a bit crowded between rivals into the first turn, saved ground around the second bend and failed to menace. MURI
(IRE) traveled three deep in mid-pack early, drew closer four deep up the backstretch, rounded the far turn three to four wide and weakened. IMA JOKER
off slow to start, settled along the inside, went between rivals on the backstretch, chased two wide on the far turn, ran into traffic in upper stretch and was
not a factor. NAKOTA (IRE) traveled three deep near the back early, between rivals on the far turn, went two wide into the lane and came up empty. SOLO
SOLATAIRE (IRE) had to pause behind a rival prior to the clubhouse turn, stalked three deep then outside a rival on the clubhouse turn, dropped back to
last on the second bend, came four wide into the lane and tired.
