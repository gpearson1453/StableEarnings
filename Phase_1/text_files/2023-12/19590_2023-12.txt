Footnotes
VINO BARBARINO vied for the early lead four wide, then three wide on the turn, continued the battle with FLUFF THE PILLOW in the lane , then prevailed
late to prove best under a drive. FLUFF THE PILLOW vied for the lead on the inside and battled through the lane but was out-kicked by the winner while
being clearly second best. ROSSINGTON was off a beat slow, settled back early and saved ground on the turn, then finished well on the inside to gain the
show award. STATES UNITED tracked the pace from the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn but faded. CROWN THAT SAINT was settled early on
the inside, then shifted out and made a mild five wide bid nearing the quarter pole, came six wide off the turn then drifted in and weakened the final furlong.
GAME MISCONDUCT prompted the early pace from the outside, four wide on the turn and tired. UNCLE EDDIE chased the pace two wide and tired.

DR ARDITO coaxed from the gate, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the inside into the turn, came under coaxing
midway on the turn, swung two to three wide into upper stretch in behind his barn mate, tipped out herding out a pair of rivals three-sixteenths from home,
dug in under a drive and was up in the last jumps to prevail. AGGREGATION established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside through
swift splits under some pressure from BARESE to the outside, got set down spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was
nailed in the final strides to the finish. BARESE led early on four to five paths off the inside before prompting the aforementioned foe from the outside four
then three wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, got herded out in tandem with GENERAL BANKER two to
three paths by DR ARDITO with three-sixteenths to run and ran on to secure the show honors. GENERAL BANKER brushed the near side stall at the start,
chased four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, got herded out two to three paths in tandem with BARESE
and ran on to the finish. CURLIN'S WISDOM five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the

Footnotes
GOLDFIRE stalked the early pace four wide, made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole to vie for command, went clear leaving the turn and held gamely
late to prove best under crop urging. JUDGE RULES was allowed to settle early, made a five wide move by the quarter pole, came six wide off the turn and
was gaining late but could not get to the winner, clearly second best. SOLO TONIGHT pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie
for command between rivals by the quarter pole, then battled to the furlong marker and faded late while besting the rest. ARCO AUGUSTA set a pressured
pace along the inside and then vied for command by the quarter pole before weakening in the drive. BLUE MARBLE chased the early pace, two to three
wide on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn but came up empty. MORQ was settled early and saved ground but tired. GO GRAD tracked the early
pace from the inside and tired. ONE WITHEVERYTHING was squeezed back at the start then trailed throughout and was eased through the lane, walked
off.

Footnotes
DOC SULLIVAN was settled early, made a five wide move on the turn to be in contention off the turn, continued that move and drew clear in the final furlong
to prove best under a drive. SORORITY PRANK stalked the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid off the turn to vie for command, battled gamely to
the wire but was outfinished by the winner while being clearly second best. ALLIED ATTACK stumbled at the start, then moves between rivals, three to four
wide on the turn and came five wide off the the turn and finished willingly to gain the show award. LI'L LANG showed good speed on the inside to set the
early pace while clear, then was headed leaving the three sixteenths and weakened the final furlong. EXECUTIVE MOVE chased the early pace four wide
and had no rally. CHARLES J was bumped at the start, then raced wide and had no rally. IRIE MAN was reserved on the inside and was not a threat.
SHORE TIME was reserved two wide and was not a factor. BIG RICH was off a half a step slow, then chased the pace in the two path, came four wide off
the turn, was crowded by the furlong marker and angled out, dropped back. FRATELLINO tracked the pace two wide and weakened. SEVENTH RACE
SHAKE was settled back early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
GUNTOWN tracked the early pace from the outside, four wide on the turn, made a bid off the turn and slowly edged clear to prove best under a drive.
SYNTHESIS set the early pace on the inside, two wide on the turn and dug in gamely in the stretch but could not hold off the winner while saving the place
award. BOLD ENDEAVOR was rated along the inside, angled out off the turn to make a bid, was blocked by the furlong marker, angled farther out for racing
room and rallied well late. BOURBON CALLING was well placed early, then went up and dueled for the lead three wide on the turn, then was outfinished
late. STOLEN BASE was settled early, made a five wide move off the the turn but flattened out. POWER SEEKER was settled back early, saved ground on
the turn and cut the corner leaving the turn, finished with interest but needed more. DUCALE was rated along early, then was between rivals on the turn,
came four wide off the turn and was in a little traffic nearing the furlong marker but had no late kick. MR BOB was settled early, two wide on the turn and
swung out four wide leaving the turn and had no rally. LIFE CHANGER prompted the early pace four wide and tired.
