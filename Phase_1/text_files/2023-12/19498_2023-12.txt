Footnotes
WHISKEYINTHEJARO , within range while outside a rival, edged up between foes past the five sixteenths, eased out to about the three path in upper
stretch, closed determinedly under strong handling and got up in the final yards. BREAK THE CHAINS took over early and set a rated pace towards the rail,
handled outside pressure leaving the three eighths, spurted clear when put to a ride entering the lane, opened up under steady hand encouragement in mid
stretch, was given a right handed ask a sixteenth out, kept on gamely but just could not fend off the winner's charge. MINXZLUCKYSTARFYRE drafted
back off the pace and off the inside, moved to the rail leaving the far turn then was put to a solid ride, altered out near the three sixteenths, worked between
foes then kept on with effort to the wire. RETURN FIRE , between rivals with the early pace, moved to apply serious pressure when called upon mid turn,
could not quicken with the leader in upper stretch, pursued past mid stretch then faded. MALINOIS , with the early pace three deep, chased outside runners
four wide in upper stretch and gave way. WHATAHARDMANFIDEAD saved ground chasing the pace, eased out in upper stretch, shifted back in near the
three sixteenths, failed to kick on past the furlong grounds and faded. DRY DOCK , erratic soon after the break, was put to a drive soon after, advanced four
wide outside runners heading to the turn, failed to kick on mid turn and gave way. IRISH ANGEL bobbled inward at the break and was away last, gained
three wide and between runners into the turn, lacked a punch under pressure past the three eighths and faltered.

Footnotes
BATTLING TIME , sluggish from the gate, was taken wide while off the contested early pace, gained outside rivals past the five eighths, took aim of an
embattled trio nearing the five sixteenths, straightened four wide pursuing in upper stretch, closed in under energetic right handed urging, took over outside
foes leaving the sixteenth marker and edged clear. SALTY GIRL got into a duel to the inside of BEEN REAL BUSY around the first turn, carried that scrum
through the backstretch run, kept on after being headed by GO SHERRY GO leaving the three eighths, fought valiantly inside a pair of rivals past mid
stretch, switched over to her left lead with a sixteenth to go and gamely earned the place. GO SHERRY GO broke slowly, regrouped and settled off the rail,
quickly gained three wide past the five eighths and tracked the duelers, bid three deep to take over leaving the three eighths but failed to shake free, held a
tenuous advantage between runners leaving the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. CLASSY CHICK stumbled badly at the break, recovered and
angled in with an advance into the backstretch, came off the rail leaving the three eighths to chase then continued with some effort to the wire. MOM'S
OPAL , between rivals early, circled four wide into the lane then went evenly. SEAFARER lagged back, raced wide into the lane and failed to menace.
BEEN REAL BUSY hooked up to the outside of SALTY GIRL entering the first turn, disputed the issue holding a short lead nearing the five eighths, could
not kick on while between runners leaving the five sixteenths and tired. SAKURA SKY broke a step slow, rushed up three wide around the first turn, dropped
in through the backstretch run while stalking the leaders, was under a strong ride pursuing past the three eighths, failed to go on, faltered and was eased
through the final furlong.

Footnotes
ONE WAY FARRIOR hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased out in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside RUBYS FLASH and swept by that one
late. RUBYS FLASH , right to the early lead, opened up along the inner rail on the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and gave way grudgingly.
WESLEY THOMAS , steadied soon after the break, was caught behind horses on the turn, swung to the three path entering the stretch and rallied outside
rivals. DANCING MISCHIEF saved ground on the turn chasing the pace, eased off the rail in upper stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole and weakened.
KINGDOM FORCE lacked speed, was fanned five deep turning for home, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. PRINCE FRED raced in the two
path between horses on the turn and lacked a rally. MON GATEAU prompted the pace outside RUBYS FLASH around the turn and gave way the final
furlong. SHAKE THE GOLD , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, faltered. JUMPINGJAGGERFLASH , outrun, was fanned four wide entering the
stretch.

Footnotes
SUSAN'S MULE broke a step slow, quickly recovered and accelerated to a staking spot three wide, bid to engage the duelers three deep past the five
sixteenths, secured command soon into the lane, opened up under a drive and was kept alert to deep stretch. DETERMINED BLUE had speed then chased
while in the clear mid turn, shifted out in the drive and continued on willingly to earn the place. IRISH RAGE , off the pace, moved up between rivals leaving
the far turn, angled out a bit to go three wide between runners in upper stretch, shifted further out for the final furlong and rallied. NO WALK INTHE PARK
broke a step slow, saved ground leaving the far turn, angled seven wide through the drive and finished with interest. SUNNY SUNSHINE was sent up
between rivals to take over early, secured the rail and set a pressured pace, stayed on willingly to mid stretch then faded. KAPADOKYA , away alertly,
disputed the pace outside SUNNY SUNSHINE, fought between rivals into the lane then faded through the final furlong. PASS THE CASH flashed speed,
chased the leaders off the rail, came three to four wide for the drive and gave way. NEXT GIRL shied inward and retreated near the half, regrouped around
the turn, came three to four wide into the lane but lacked a solid finish. YUMYUM EAT EM UP bobbled at the break, raced well back while three wide,
angled six wide into the lane and failed to threaten. SHARMIN stumbled badly at the break, raced far back into and around the turn, came wide for the drive
and offered a mild response. LEAVE DRAMA BEHIND flashed speed, chased while saving ground and faltered in upper stretch. SMOKIN SISTER , three
wide early, angled in around the turn and dropped back through the drive.

FUN LOVIN CRIMINAL came out a bit soon after the break, chased the pace, circled the far turn four deep, led upper stretch, drifted out inside the eighth
pole and lasted. ALOTTACENTS lacked speed, was in the two path on both turns, was in hand waiting for room entering the stretch, eased out in upper
stretch, rallied and switched to his leaf lead near the sixteenth pole. APPENDAGE , steadied in close quarters along the inner rail mid way on the first turn,
was well back to the far turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied. BONDED , three wide both turns, bid for the lead midwaystretchon the far
turn and weakened through the stretch. DREAM OF BLESSINGS raced along the inner rail on the far turn and failed to rally. CAVALRY COMMAND
disputed the pace between horses and weakened through the stretch. SPONSORED , bumped and steadied soon after the break, was outrun. COCO
SHELL , no factor, was four wide turning for home. SWEET ASTA reared a bit at the break, checked when bumping with SPONSORED soon after the start
then lost ground on the turns. PRINCE OF PORTLAND showed speed along the inner rail, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
FIZBO , five wide outside rivals heading to the half, was deftly maneuvered to the rail around the turn, slipped through to the inside of rivals nearing mid
stretch to challenge for command, took over soon after, kept on under right handed asks and held firm. GRAND MANNER was gunned up between runners
early, engaged WINNERS LAUGH from his outside to contest the pace, kicked clear leaving the far turn, remained off the rail and under asking into the
lane, battled on between rivals leaving mid stretch and finished gamely to earn the place. PRESSING CONCERN bobbled at the break, recovered and
angled in, gained along the rail past the five sixteenths, angled three to four wide with aim into the lane, ranged up to threaten in mid stretch, vied then hung
late. WORKIN ON A DREAM , four deep mid turn, continued wide chasing in upper stretch but failed to muster up a solid finish. TAUBER , between rivals
mid turn, angled out and came up empty. WINNERS LAUGH sped to the early lead, took pressed then ceded to GRAND MANNER into the turn, eased out
to chased past the three eighths, moved back in near the three sixteenths and weakened.
