Footnotes
PANOLA tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two and three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and
kicked clear late. MISS FABIANA led the way up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and was caught late.
PAMZ PALACE raced off the pace on the outside early, came around the bend in the three and four path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and gained
ground in late stretch. HARD SPICE stalked the pace setter on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, challenged from the three and four path
coming around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch. STATELY APRIL bumped with the horse to her outside at the start, settled in the middle of the
pack on the rail for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and finished evenly. THE GODDESS NIKE bumped repeatedly with the
horses to both sides leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and passed tiring
horses in the lane. LITERATI bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, trailed the field early, saved ground around the turn and made up some
ground in the stretch while never threatening. BEAUTIFULLYPERFECT raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and made no bid. BLACK BULLET bumped with the horses to both sides at the break, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening
quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the four path and faded from there. BINGO'S DREAM chased the pace setter between horses up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the two path and tired in the stretch.
