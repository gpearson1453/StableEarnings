Footnotes
TRANE STATION V broke thru gate when OPTICAL ILLUSION false broke thru the gate, reloaded, away cleanly, drifted in a path and bumped solidly, rider
switched to left hand and urged left handed, asked right handed past the gap, and kept to a drive to the wire after taking command approaching the final
hundred and ten yards in a gallant effort. FIVE BAR SUPREME away well, asked right handed early, took the lead early, drifted out a path and a half under
right handed urging, asked again midway and kept to a drive in a game second along the inside. OPTICAL ILLUSION broke thru the gate prior, reloaded,
came away well while breaking in a path, asked left handed early, asked again passing the eighth, asked again approaching the sixteenth, and drifted out
two paths in a good try. CHECKN CARTEL away well while breaking in a path, asked right handed early, asked again midway, minor bobbling late in a solid
try. APOLLITICAL OPEN MRL bumped both sides at the start, bit in tight early while leaning on inside horse, leveled and kept to a drive to the wire to win a
photo for fifth. UNRELENTLESS bumped on both sides at the start, kept in a crowded tight spot the first hundred and fifty yards, finally had some room, kept
to task with right handed urging and missed fifth in a three way photo. SOUTHERN DIVINE came in and bumped inside rival at the start, pushed out and
pinballed when bumping into outside rival, leveled and gamely kept trying under right handed urging. AB WOW rubbed outside part of the gate, bumped
outside rival at the start, brushed on his hind end early, altered in approaching the gap, and kept to task under right handed urging. THINK AGAIN KEV
experienced multiple bumps from both sides at the start, in tight first half of the race, shied away from rival passing the eighth pole and never had a clear
path.
