Footnotes
GO CATS inside run to the quarter pole, angled out with a rush, cleared. GIOVANNINO inside speed, dueled to far turn, dug in stretch but outsprinted. WE
WILL CONQUER raced between horses to the half while evenly for show spot. MY SANCTUARY inside run to backstretch, angled out past quarter pole, no
kick. PEARSE off rail run to the far turn, leveled off into the stretch run. SILVER RALEIGH pressed pace from two path, weakened from inside in the stretch.
SPUNS SON hopped at the start with no speed to far turn and passed some. MY FRIEND LOUIE no speed throughout and never close. THE THUNDERER
could not keep up from far turn outside, faded back readily. STARFORCE never menaced throughout. QAADER was never a factor throughout while inside.
CUORE D'ORO always back and lost contact with the field but crossed the line.
