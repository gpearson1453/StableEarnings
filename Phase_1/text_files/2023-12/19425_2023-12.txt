Footnotes
TRUE BLUE PEARL bumped the outside rival at the start, settled in behind the leaders tracking inside saving ground early, shifted out early on the far turn,
was put to urging past the five-sixteenths, bid four wide at the quarter pole taking command by the top of the stretch, forged clear under steady handling.
JOYA DEL SUR was bumped at the start but quickly moved forward inside a foe to a narrow lead setting the pace just off the rail, faced increased pressure
up the backstretch, was headed by the three-eighths, but kept on in the stretch. DAILY PLANET settled well back saving ground inside, improved position
inside steadily gaining to get up for show honors late. ESPERANNNA broke on top and was strongly urged from the start, was forwardly-positioned outside
the leader into the first turn pressing three wide, applied more pressure into the far turn taking a narrow lead about the three-eighths, faltered in the stretch.
FOOL YOURSELF bobbled ever so slightly at the start, was forwardly-placed between runners chasing two to four wide early, steadily weakened while
being asked outside the three-eighths and continued to fade. FEATHERS (IRE) exchanged a very light bump at the start, raced at the back off the inside,
was never near enough to threaten. MATOULA exchanged very light contact at the start, pursued from outside foes mid-pack three to four wide early,
dropped back and shifted in a bit, tired.

Footnotes
CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO settled outside off the pace stalking four deep into the turn, fanned out six wide turning for home, bid near the furlong grounds
while drifting in just a hair, took command and cleared. SAVOY chased from inside, dropped back, moved out seven wide in upper stretch, came again to
gain late. SHOOT THEMESSENGER was in just a bit tight soon after the start, settled outside in the back half of the field three wide into the turn, fanned
eight deep for the drive, gained some but needed more. GRAND MANNER was forwardly-positioned chasing in behind racing off the fence, advanced three
then four wide on the turn looming a threat coming to the quarter pole, took a narrow lead about the three-sixteenths, drifted a bit in mid-stretch and was
overtaken then subsequently outkicked. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND bumped a rival lightly after the start, chased in behind mid-pack shifting in, raced near but
off the rail on the turn, moved out five wide turning for home, was in a bit tight near the furlong marker, ran on. BAD GUY broke a step slowly and lacked
early speed, passed tired foes. MICE AND MEN switched out racing toward the rear, went four wide into the turn, fanned nine deep out of that bend, lacked
the needed late kick. ONE MORE FACTOR was bumped after the break, quickly moved forward to press the leader from outside, took over by the
seven-sixteenths, moved clear by the five-sixteenths, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened. GRAND ESCAPE sped clear after the start to set the
pace inside, faced pressure late up the backstretch and was overtaken into the turn, weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
C C ROYAL attended from outside, moved to the lead three wide by the three-eighths, forged clear in the stretch, was taken in hand just past the sixteenth
pole to the wire. SHAKE THE SUGAR advanced while shifting out from three to five wide on the turn, was no match for the winner but second best. BLUE
TRILLION chased mostly two to three wide early, kept on in the lane but needed more. SHINING SPIRIT chased from inside but was outsprinted, came out
in upper stretch and ran on. KEEP IT SAFE was among the early leaders inside but soon dropped back, tracked in behind, switched out to advance three
then four wide coming to the quarter pole, flattened out in the drive. TOHONORSTELLE quickly dropped back outside, shifted in, failed to rally. A P M
NOTION quickly moved to the lead from between rivals, was overtaken early on the turn by an outside foe, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
MAGIC MICHAEL tucked in heading into the first turn saving ground settling off the pace and inside runners, took closer order heading into the far turn,
moved out on that bend going mostly three wide and coming out five deep under urging by the quarter pole, struck the lead in mid-stretch and drew clear.
ALL THREES was taken back off the leading pair content to stalk those two while switching out three deep, moved outside on the far turn taking the lead
outside the five-sixteenths, drifted out a path leaving that bend, was overtaken in mid-stretch and second best. OUTLIER pressed from inside till the far turn,
kept on but needed more. BERKS moved forward three wide into the first turn shifting in a path and forcing the pace from outside with a narrow advantage,
dispatched the inside rival on the far turn but was soon overtaken by an outside foe, had no extra for the drive. SHAFT'S BULLET raced outside at the back
mostly three to four wide through the turns fanning six wide into upper stretch, failed to rally. DATS MR. MO raced mid-pack tucking in but off the fence in
the two to three path, was encouraged along by the nine-sixteenths, dropped back between runners, failed to menace. MONDAY MORNING QB was at the
back three wide early and never a factor.

Footnotes
CUCHULAIN settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, surged late inside to get up late. GABRIEL SEVEN was forwardly-positioned into the turn going
three wide and in range on that bend, drifted about in the stretch bumping with the leader, bid past the sixteenth pole taking a narrow lead briefly but was
outfinished. UNCLE CHINITO broke outwardly, vied then moved clear coming to the half and set the pace from just off the fence, exchanged a bump in
mid-stretch, was outkicked. MINNY SPEIGHTSTER pressed from inside early, dropped back off the leaders, shifted out five wide turning into upper stretch,
ran on. NEVER GREW UP was outpaced early, advanced two to three wide on the turn and under strong urging by the quarter pole, evened out in the lane.
GINO THINKABOUTIT lacked early speed racing at the rear near but off the inside, swung five wide into upper stretch, drifted in a bit, ran on to improve.
MINIMO was within range four wide on the turn fanning seven deep into upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. TORTOLA broke outwardly, raced
outside foes four to five wide into the turn, fanned eight deep into upper stretch, was never a threat. MUCHO DE LA MANCHA chased three to five wide,
failed to rally. MY ENDEAVOR broke a step slowly and in tight, lacked early speed, failed to threaten. ERIC'S GIFT showed very brief speed between
runners but steadily retreated. IMAGINE THE GLORY was ridden along early, failed to rally.

Footnotes
CROSSLAND pressed from outside from the start, raced mostly three wide, drew even coming to the three-eighths, had command at the five-sixteenths,
moved clear and held sway while being kept to the task. UNCAPTURED STORM tracked inside, shifted five wide into the stretch, loomed a threat, couldn't
get past but was second best. MCCRAKENS GHOST settled off the pace inside, saved ground, advanced rapidly inside foes midway on the far turn, was
guided out past the five-sixteenths, floated six wide turning for home and loomed a threat, evened out. BROOKLYN GUY tucked in saving ground through
the first turn bringing up the rear, advanced inside foes on the far turn, came out in upper stretch then was carried out further by a drifting rival. VAX A
NATION was caught outside four to five deep through the first turn, tucked in a bit racing three to four wide into the far turn, failed to rally. NO EASY DAYS
got away well and went straight to the front with some coaxing, set a pressured pace in the two path, was overtaken on the far turn, switched out and drifted
a bit leaving that bend then drifted more in mid-stretch, faded. LANGLEE AVENUE bumped a rival at the start, was mid-pack two to three wide between foes
up the backstretch, continued two to three deep on the far turn, failed to rally. HACHURE was bumped at the start, moved forward four wide early keen to go
on, stalked from outside, dropped back four to five deep on the far turn, tired.

Footnotes
ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE bumped a rival at the start, stalked from outside, bid three wide coming to the quarter pole, took the lead about the three-sixteenths,
began to edge away but drifted in a bit near the eighth pole, drifted out a bit soon after while drawing clear, prevailed. TENEBRIS pressed the pace, bid
between foes turning for home, was in a bit tight and altered out past the furlong marker, ran on. HEADS OR TAILS was bumped at the start, settled
mid-pack inside, saved ground, came out in upper stretch then altered outside a rival bumping the outside foe past the eighth pole, ran on. AMPERSAND
shifted in settling at the back, saved some ground through the turn, came out in upper stretch then was carried out further in mid-stretch. DISPUTED CLAIM
was quick to the lead, set the pace inside, was hounded by outside foes, weakened in the lane. TIDEWATER stumbled slightly at the start, was outpaced
early, advanced between foes about the three-eighths gaining on the leaders, fanned out a bit into upper stretch then was bumped and forced out past the
eighth pole, lacked the needed late effort. FOLE'S NOTION was outpaced racing outside four wide toward the rear, fanned eight wide, was not a threat.
IRISH WARLOCK was bumped into a rival at the start, chased three wide, swung out six deep into upper stretch, was unable to threaten. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF TENEBRIS AGAINST ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN
THE STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND BEHIND THE FORMER.

Footnotes
NORTHERN GLOW broke outwardly, settled last but one well back of the leaders, advanced three to four wide on the far turn drawing even at the
five-sixteenths and dueling into upper stretch, edged away, held. RED WINE TIME broke slowly and lost the path, settled at the rear, swung eight wide into
upper stretch, was gaining steadily but too late, got up for second. BAY STREET moved clear, set the pace inside, was off the rail when engaged by a foe
turning for home, dueled inside that one, yielded and lost place late. LIFELOVENLAUGHTER came out at the start, pursued the leader two to three wide,
was ridden along past the five-sixteenths, failed to rally. HEYBACKATCHA was forwardly-positioned stalking three wide early, shifted in and advanced
inside early on the far turn lacking room, evened out.

further for the drive then back nearer the inside, finished strongly between foes late to secure the place. HUNTER JOE stalked from outside four wide, bid
coming to the five-sixteenths while moving in, took the lead continuing to move nearer the rail, was challenged in the stretch and outfinished. FORTUNE'S

back, advanced while swinging seven wide into upper stretch, evened out. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY pursued the leader from between runners three wide into
