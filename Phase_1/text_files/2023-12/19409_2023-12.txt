Footnotes
CHI TOWN HUSTLER showed the way well in hand around the turn, shook clear in the two path in upper stretch before being set down entering the final
furlong, then held from an outer late bidder. LUPO'S LEGACY stalked along the inside, pursued outside of the leader around the turn, maintained striking
range as that one inched clear in upper stretch, chased through midstretch before steadily closing the gap in the final sixteenth, but ran out of ground to reel
in the leader. SEEKING SAWYER laid off of the pace in the four to three path into the turn, gained show shifting out slightly entering upper stretch, then
chased the top pair home. OVERANALYTICAL tracked in the five path and outside of foes, inched closer to stalk from the four path into the turn, but chased
turning for home, then faded once floated to the five path at the quarter pole. CHARLIE'S CREED trailed in the three path and was outrun.

Footnotes
SWIFT N TRAFFIC stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leader into the far turn, bid in the five path entering the lane and edged past. PAYOFF
CYCLE set the pace in the two path, shifted out to the four path while meeting an outer challenge entering upper stretch but was bested. MY LIL DUDE took
contact to his hind quarters from an inner rival at the start, pressed the leader from the three path early on, but weakened in the four path around the far turn
yet lasted for show. STONE ALLIANCE leaned out and bumped a rival at the start, pursued from the three to four path, took the far turn in the five to six
path and failed to menace. ROCK STAR ALEX laid off of the pace in the two path and gave way. MAIN DUDE bobbled a bit before being bumped by an
inner rival into an outer foe at the start, trailed in the four to five path around the first turn and showed little thereafter.

Footnotes
CRAKEN JAX dislodged his rider momentarily while warming up, set the pace in the two path around the turn, met an outer challenge nearing the lane,
shook free of that one in upper stretch and held sway. SKINNY BOBBY tracked in the four path, ranged up to offer a bid passing the five sixteenths pole, but
was turned away in the five path at the quarter pole, then sustained a chase well through the final furlong to hold place. HANGIN' TUFF tracked along the
inside, then chased while one paced through the lane. MUNCLE broke a step slow, raced off of the pace in the two path into the turn, shifted out leaving the
quarter pole, but drifted further out at the furlong grounds, yet ran on willingly thereafter. SPEIGHTFUL ONE pressed outside of the leader, chased that one
from the three path into the turn, lost place to an outer foe approaching the five sixteenths pole, then kept on mildly between horses. CAJUN MISCHIEF
pursued from the five path, tucked to the three path into the turn, but fanned back to the five path entering the lane and gave way. NOT LIKELY broke
outwardly, lacked speed in the four to five path, drifted to the seven path entering the lane and made little impact. TAKEOVER FIFTYFOUR was off slowly
then shied from inner rivals at the start and was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
WIN WORTHY trailed in the two path, paused behind foes turning for home, encountered traffic while off of the rail in upper stretch, tipped inwardly for clear
sailing at the three sixteenths pole, offered a rail bid approaching the furlong grounds, drove clear leaving that juncture and held sway. FLAWLESS RULER
tracked in the three path, was urged along in pursuit in the four path around the far turn, sustained grinding progress to produce a bid for the lead in
midstretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival at the furlong grounds and proved second best. MY ROMEO LIMA broke a beat slow, stalked the embattled
pair from the two path, inched closer turning for home before taking aim three wide entering the lane, bid along with rivals on both sides nearing the furlong
grounds, but was outkicked while edging show. OF THE MOMENT sparred for the lead with an outer rival around the first turn and into the far bend, shook
clear of that one entering the lane, but faltered between bidders at the furlong grounds. BUTLER CABIN bobbled a bit upon leaving the gates, laid off of the
pace two wide, but was hung in the five path around the far turn and failed to menace. JRUE BREEZE lacked speed along the inside, shifted off the rail
turning for home, but yielded between horses entering the lane. CLARESTOWN sparred for the lead two wide but weakened entering the lane and caved.

Footnotes
GUNNER BAY rushed forward to set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer rival around the turn, drew clear in upper stretch while hanging on his left
lead, then changed over at the furlong grounds to seal the deal. FLAT OUT AMERICAN tracked in the four path, took aim in the five path entering the lane,
failed to keep pace with the clearing leader before vying for place with an inner foe through the final furlong and prevailed. FAMILY CREED stalked outside
of the pace setter, inched forward to vie with that one while taking the turn in the three path, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, vied for place with an
outer bidder through the final furlong but was bested. FORSAKEN leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path, swung
out to the six path entering the lane and ran on mildly. GHENT bobbled slightly while bumping with rivals on both sides at the start, chased along the inside,
then lacked a bid between horses and yielded. YANKEE HUMOR required a shoe repair in the paddock, bumped with an outer rival at the start, trailed along
the inside, then was outrun and eased through the lane.

SUMMER LOVER trailed around both turns, shifted out to the eight path in midstretch, rallied outside of foes to bid at the sixteenth pole and drew clear. EL
PERFECTO steadied out of crowded quarters among foes early on, lacked speed in the two path, pursued in the three to four path around the far turn,
drifted out to the seven path in midstretch, rallied to bid along with an outer rival at the sixteen the pole but got outkicked. HE GOTS TO GO settled off of the
pace in the three to four path, launched an early gain to press the top pair into the far turn, failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, yet kept on
between horses to rebid in the final furlong, but was outkicked by an outer pair leaving the sixteenth pole, then narrowly prevailed for show. LIQUID
ADDICTION (IRE) stalked in the two path, tipped four wide entering the lane, rallied to bid passing the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer at the
sixteenth pole and missed show to an inner rival late. UNDER SURVEILLANCE laid off of the pace along the inside, sustained a rail grind to attempt a bid in
the final furlong, but flattened out. BILLY'S GOT ISSUES tracked in the four to three path before shifting in entering the backstretch, took closer order
approaching the far turn, tracked around that bend, then tipped two wide entering the lane and yielded between horses. SIR LIAM was brushed by rivals on
either side soon after the start, vied with an outer rival while tugging, clung to an advantage from an outer pair into the far turn, drew clear entering the lane,
but tired in midstretch and faltered between horses with a sixteenth to go. LOOKIN AT BETTY was outrun in the four path. EL MUCHO leaned out at the
start, vied two wide, then between horses into the far turn, but weakened nearing the lane and caved through the final furlong.

CLEAR AS A BELE broke slowly and took light contact from rivals on both sides at the start, lacked speed in the four path into the turn, fanned out to the
nine path entering the lane, rallied on his left lead to bid in the final sixteenth and got up late. HARDLY ABLE stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the
clearing leader entering the lane, chased on his left lead, ranged up to the tiring leader to bid along with an outer counterpart in the final sixteenth but was
outkicked and saved place. BIG BOO trailed in the three to five path, gradually shifted outwardly approaching the furlong grounds, then rallied widest to miss
reaching place while gaining show. GEORGE ALLEN set a clear pace in the two path around the turn, inched a wider margin in upper stretch, but tired in
the final furlong and was caught by a trio of bidders in the closing stages. MACHO BEANIE was fractious in the starting gate, stalked in the three path and
between horses, floated to the five path entering the lane, chased through midstretch and yielded between horses at the sixteenth pole. STAR
REDEMPTION broke outwardly, raced off of the pace in the three path and between horses then ran on willingly among foes. TAMBOURINE STAR laid off
of the pace in the five to eight path, then ran on mildly between horses before bumping with an inner rival at the sixteenth pole. DUVEE saved ground in
midpack but to no avail. CALIBRACHOA KID pursued from the three path, spun for home in the seven path and between horses, but lacked a bid before
bumping with an outer rival in the final furlong. GUITAR DOCTOR chased forwardly in the four path, floated to the six path entering the lane and weakened
between horses. RANCH BADGE broke slowly and was outrun along the inside.

CHARGING set the pace along the inside via a clear margin around the turn, inched further away in midstretch and held sway. SON OF A BIRCH lacked
speed in the three path and between horses, shifted to the four path entering the lane, then rallied among foes to bid for place in the final sixteenth and
prevailed. GILDED RULER bumped with an outer rival soon after the start, pursued from midpack in the two to three path, fanned out to the five path
entering the lane, ran on outside of foes in the final furlong to offer a late bid for place, but missed to an inner rival at the wire. SIMPLE LOGIC lacked speed
along the inside, then stayed on between horses to offer a late bid for place, but was outfinished by an outer pair. STRAIGHT AND LEVEL stalked two wide
and between horses, chased the clear leader through midstretch, but yielded place to rivals on either side in the final sixteenth. WESTERN COMMAND
tracked along the inside, shifted four wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid and was outkicked for minor placings by rivals on either side passing the
sixteenth pole. BATTLE SCARS lacked speed in the four to seven path and moved up lat. PROUD CIVILIAN pursued from midpack along the inside, but
lacked a bid and faded late. MESA SPIRIT bumped with an inner rival soon after the start, tracked three wide into the turn, chased on his left lead through
upper stretch but weakened between horses with a sixteenth to go. STARTONAHIGHNOTE laid off of the pace in the three to four path, swung to the six
path entering the lane and tired on his left lead. MONJID settled in the two path and faded.

CAJUN CONNECTION stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane, bid while leaning outwardly in upper stretch and drove
clear at the furlong grounds. DOUBLE ON THE RED laid off of the pace in the two path, tracked between rivals into the far turn, got floated four wide by an
inner foe entering the lane, chased that one as he cleared into midstretch and edged place from an inner foe at the sixteenth pole. CROSSING IRIS raced at
the rear along the inside, improved inside of rivals while shifting outwardly approaching midstretch, chased between foes into the final furlong and forged
show from an inner rival late. MYSTERIOUS SPIRIT pressed the leader from the three path, pulled continuously entering the backstretch before settling into
stride after steadying at the nine sixteenths pole, sparred two wide around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch and yielded
through the final furlong. MARVINS' POSSE lacked speed in the five to three path, swung out to the seven path in upper stretch and failed to menace. RUN
ON ACES tracked in the four path, but faded once floated to the six path entering the lane. MUCHO BUENO set the pace in the two path as an outer rival
vied, got headed by that one turning for home, fought on through upper stretch but weakened at the furlong grounds.
