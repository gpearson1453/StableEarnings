TIEMPO PERFECTO sprinted away in the opening quarter, remained clear then lasted while weakening late. ZOPPI FISCHBEIN lacked speed, swung very
wide on the turn and narrowed the gap too late. FINANCIAL STRENGTH saved ground, bid closer nearing midstretch then made a gradual late gain. AYE
was urged off the pacesetter between foes and flattened out in the lane. BADBADBOBBY chased three wide for half a mile and faltered. LIBERTY RUNNER
lacked speed racing wide and trailed throughout.

SAILOR'S RETURN advanced quickly inside to the front before the half then steadily drew away while kept to his business. SAL N LOUIE saved ground off
the pace, went after the winner on the final turn but proved no match. HIT ME I'M LUCKY dropped well behind then rallied inside to gain the show late.
QUICKENING urged from the outset, vied early, dropped back, came again then moved wide in the lane. ESOR raced wide off the leaders, made a brief bid
on the final turn then faded. LOUIE'S LAW lagged far behind then caught a fading rival. URMIZZENTHEPOINT flashed speed in the two path then was
finished after half a mile.
