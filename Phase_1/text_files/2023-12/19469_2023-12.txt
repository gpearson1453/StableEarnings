BEAT THE DOUBLE vied for the early lead, drove clear down the backside, saved ground around the turn, dueled down the lane with CRAFTROOM and
prevailed for the win. CRAFTROOM challenged on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the home stretch, was outfinished for the win,
but proved best of others. STARSHIP NOLA lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no match for the top two. SPARKLE CITY raced within
striking distance, made a mild inside bid, but was no real factor. GRACE'S VISION raced near the back in the early part, improved position, but was no
threat. MALLORY UNBRIDLED raced within striking distance, had an outside trip, made a bid and faded. STARRY STARRY DAY raced near the middle of
the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. REINA'S VISION dueled for the early lead and made a steady retreat. PENNIE'S MAGIC raced evenly
near the back and showed little. BAILEY'S CHARM always raced near the back, was outrun and eased to the wire.

Footnotes
SASSI STRUTTER sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task. MISS LEONA raced within contention, moved up around the
turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. MARIAH pressed the pace, saved ground, weakened and proved no match for the top two.
DON'T BE BOSSY raced within striking distance, weakened, finished evenly and lacked a bid. GOOD BY FAITH void of early speed, raced outside around
the turn and was never a threat. MARY WHO lacked early speed and showed little.

Footnotes
PARTY GRAS pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the home stretch and prevailed for the win. ADMIRAL RISTY vied for the early
lead, dueled throughout, was outfinished for the win, but held on for second. BUFFETT raced in the middle of the pack, moved up on the outside around the
final turn, made a wide bid and was outfinished by the top two. JUST BECAUSE had a tight start, racing from the back, came around the first turn on the
outside, made a late bid and finished willingly. WINDTAPPER WIN dueled on the front end, kept the advantage until weakening down the final stretch.
ROCKY BOY lacked early speed, saved ground around the final turn and was never a factor. WINNING DANCE pressed the early pace and was finished
early. DOCE DE LA NOCHE raced in the middle of the field, came around the first turn on the outside and dropped back. COZY GEM always raced near the
back and was pulled up down the home stretch and walked off.
