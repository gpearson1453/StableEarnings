FINANCIAL STRENGTH outrun early inside, circled his field on the turn then surged clear late while kept to his task. BOBBY'S CANDY prompted the pace
three wide, reached even terms in midstretch and continued willingly for the place. WARRIOR'S VOW broke slowly, chased outside, angled inside rallying in
the stretch and closed well. CRACK THE CODE vied outside, led narrowly on the turn and continued gamely to the finish. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE
lagged far behind inside, moved out in the stretch with some late interest. SMART AND FAST saved ground just off the leaders and faltered. PLENTY OF
TIME earned a slight advantage dueling inside and gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
CHICA CHUCK raced off the rail, off the pace, bid three wide nearing the quarter pole, dueled with PARTY AT SAM'S into the stretch, drifted in bumping
that rival at the eighth pole, then was bumped by that rival soon after, dug in gamely outside and prevailed. PARTY AT SAM'S set the pace racing with a
clear lead, dueled with CHICA CHUCK turning for home, was bumped by that rival at the furlong marker, then drifted out bumping with that rival again and
dug in gamely to the finish. TRY HARDER tracked on the inside, chased inside on the turn, rallied mildly inside in the lane and earned the show spot.
JESUS' DREAM steadied in the early stages, raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the turn and lacked a stretch response. RUMAWAY trailed
the field and did not factor. SWING OIL was fractious and reluctant to load, then stalked three wide, chased on the turn and faded. NUEDORF pulled early
between rivals, chased on the turn and gave way. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run, along with a Jockey Objection by the runner up against the
winner, the race was declared official.

Footnotes
GIVE IT A GO settled close up, bid to the front into the far turn, repelled challenges in the stretch and held on. ESOR saved ground throughout, was in tight
briefly in the stretch and finished willingly. DISTURBED rushed to the front from the outside, faded on the final turn then came again late. IMAGINE THIS
dropped back wide early, bid very wide in the lane and closed well. LONG LEGGED BOY rated just off the leaders, bid after half a mile then flattened out.
RUNNIN JOKE broke a step slowly, rushed to contention then weakened. DREAM BIG DREAMS broke a step slowly, advanced wide and proved empty in
the stretch. OMERTA CODE trailed far behind then caught a stopping rival. ALONZO MOSELY steadied into the first turn along the inside and was never a
factor. The rider of the second finisher claimed foul against the winner for interference at the start and in the stretch but it was dismissed. PER RULING
FROM HIWU, ESOR WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

LONESOME BOY vied briefly inside, shook loose after quarter mile, eagerly drew off extending his advantage while under moderate urging . I CAN DO
MAGIC outrun early, advanced inside and closed well for the place. LANIE'S FIRST DUDE raced off the pace in the two path and continued willingly.
BIAGIO dropped far back wide down the backstretch, angled in and rallied. RESTLESS dueled winner opening quarter, pursued to the stretch and
weakened. DOS DE OROS chased three wide and lacked a solid rally. FREE BIRD BORDO raced off the leaders wide and failed to respond. CHECKING
BOXES rushed to contention wide early then was finished after half a mile. CRAIGH NA DUN was urged close up down the backstretch then stopped.
MARINE PATROL lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

the end. MODERN ERA raced off the pace, chased two wide on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. CHANGING THE

THEARCHERORTHEPREY chased two wide, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied between foes in upper stretch, then angled out and
ran down MISS CINNAMON in deep stretch for the win. MISS CINNAMON chased three wide, chased on the turn, moved up between rivals at the quarter
pole, rallied strongly at the furlong marker, charged to the front, dug in gamely and yielded late. SOULFUL TARA broke awkwardly causing the ride to lose
an iron, chased four wide early, recovered around the half mile marker, bid two wide on the turn, took over, led into the lane, dug in gamely, then weakened
and held for third. SNOW LAKE raced off the rail, off the pace, made a three wide run into contention on the turn, then finished evenly in the lane. ONE OF
THE ONES bumped at the start, raced four wide off the early pace, then chased three or four wide on the turn and lacked a rally. WINE GODDESS broke in
bumping a rival at the start, was outrun early and closed belatedly on the rail. DROWNINGNCHOCOLATE bumped at the start, raced three wide off the
pace, chased on the turn and had no rally. WILD GIRL chased on the inside, checked in tight entering the turn and dropped back. TREASURE PEACE set
the pace on the inside, dueled briefly and gave way.
