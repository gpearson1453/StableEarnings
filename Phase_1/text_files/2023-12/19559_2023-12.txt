Footnotes
CRAZY LEGS HIRSCH was off slowly, then moved up between rivals on the first turn to chase the early pace, then tracked the front runner on the tu rn and
made a two wide bid and took over off the turn and kicked clear to prove best under crop urging. SITTIN ON GO set the early pace while clear on the inside,
headed nearing the quarter pole, then proved to be no match for the winner while saving the place award. MIDNIGHT ACT was rated four to three wide,
made a three wide bid off the turn but needed more late, held show award. REDEEM EDDIE was reserved early three wide, made a four wide bid leaving
the quarter pole but flattened out. WISH FOR PEACE was reserved early on the inside, eased out on the turn and came five wide off the turn and had no
significant rally. STRAWBERRY TREAT chased the pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
GRAB THE GOLD prompted the pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to be clear by the quarter pole, then was headed by the furlong marker
and dug in gamely to hold on to prove best under a stiff drive. JUMPMASTER was rated on the outside early, made a four wide move on the turn to loom
boldly, then got to even terms by the furlong marker but hung, clearly second best. BOURBON CURRENCY chased the early pace in between rivals, two
wide by the quarter pole but lacked the needed closing bid while besting the rest. SHANGHAI CANDY was reserved early, three wide by the quarter pole,
swung out five wide leaving the turn and had no rally. MARTINKELLY tracked the pace from the inside and weakened. THE ILLUSIONIST set the pace on
the inside and was headed on the turn and gave way.

DR RAGS prompted the early pace from the outside, then went up to press the pace on the turn and made a four wide bid off the turn, then had a long drive
and edged clear to prove best, driving. FREEDOM'S START was allowed to settle early, came seven wide into the lane and closed the gap fast late.
ECLIPTICALS BEAR set a pressured pace and was two to three wide on the turn, then dug in gamely in the drive but was outfinished. KAZ MUNNINGS
chased the pace three wide, came six wide into the lane but had no kick, even effort. AMICALOLA FALLS tracked the early pace on the inside, then eased
out on the turn and came five wide off the turn, then angled in to the rail and finished willingly but needed more. ON OUR WAY BOYZ pressed the early
pace in between rivals, three to two wide on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn, then shifted in by the furlong marker and weakened. JUGGLER
was off slow and never threatened. LARZ rushed up the inside to press the pace from the inside and then faltered the final quarter of a mile.

HOT FUDGE WARRIOR set the pacer while in the two path, then came three wide off the turn and kicked away by the furlong marker, then was kept to crop
urging to prove best. STASSI stumbled at the start, recovered to stalk the winner three wide, then was sent down leaving the turn and finished willingly but
could not get to the winner while holding on to the place award gamely. CUT FROM CLASS tracked the pace two wide, then was between rivals by the
quarter pole, then ran on but was out-kicked for the place award. CHARM ALARM was settled early between rivals, swung out five wide leaving the turn and
had a late rally. MONGOLIAN PANTHER tracked the pace three wide and came four wide off the turn but had no kick. CABRA CHICA was settled on the
inside and saved ground on the turn, swung out three wide leaving the turn and had no rally. BUSTIN DOWN DOORS was bumped at the start, prompted
the winner from the inside and weakened in the drive. EARLY FROST was settled early on the outside and was not a threat.

ROBO WARRIOR prompted the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to take over nearing the quarter pole, then lugged in slightly by the
three sixteenths, then was corrected and kicked away in the furlong grounds to prove best under left handed crop urging. BROKENHEARTED was well
placed early towards the inside, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole to loom boldly off the turn, but flattened out the final furlong, held place award.
CALL ME NOW was settled early, three wide by the quarter pole and came four wide off the turn and had a late rally. SPORTING THE GOLD set the pace
from the inside and then dueled for the lead on the turn, weakened in the drive. SUPER JO bobbled at the start, then recovered and chased the pace on the
outside, then was three wide on the turn and stopped.

MONEY MAKING KAZ dueled for the lead on the outside, made a two wide bid leaving the furlong marker and drew clear to prove best under a drive. HE IS
BAD dueled for the lead on the inside but could not go with the winner late, second best. WICKED IRISHMAN chased the pace two wide early, two to three
wide on the turn, then lacked the needed closing bid while gaining the show award. SPELLED WELL chased the early pace in between rivals, then came
four wide into the lane but lacked the needed closing bid while being out-kicked for the show award. OVER THE BORDER chased the early pace on the
outside, dropped back on the turn, three wide by the quarter pole, shifted in and had a mild late gain. BRANTLEYS BIG GUN tracked the early pace on the
inside, shuffled back on the turn, then stayed on the inside and faded. BUMBLE MONSTER broke in the air at the start, then advanced on the inside on the
turn, two wide by the quarter pole and then weakened. LOOKIN BACK LUCKY failed to menace. LYFE IS SIMPLE was not a factror.

GOLDEN EIB MICRPHN set the early pace and then drew off in the lane and was ridden out to prove much the best. DAILY BRIEFING stalked the winner
three wide and proved to be no match for that rival while saving the place award. RISQUE'S JEWEL was reserved early, came five wide into the lane and
had a belated rally to just miss the place award. HALLIGIRL was settled early, made a mild bid on the turn but flattened out. MELODIA was well placed early
two wide and weakened. CARLY HUSTLE chased the early pace on the inside and stopped.
