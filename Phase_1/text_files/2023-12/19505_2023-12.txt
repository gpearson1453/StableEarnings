Footnotes
MAGIC TOMAHAWK settled on the rail in midfield down the backstretch, improved inside through the turn, was looking for running room behind the leaders
straightening out for the drive, angled out, bullying his way through in the five path at the sixteenth pole and surged late to get the victory. CELENTANO was
unhurried having one foe beaten down the backside, improved passing horses outside at the three furlong pole, weaved between runners smartly with a
quarter to run, burst between rivals in the four path in upper stretch, took command briefly with an eighth to go but could not fend off the charging winner in
the final strides. FIGHTING IRISH was coaxed early on down the backstretch to stay in touch with the field, began to pick up rivals four wide at the quarter
pole, shifted out for clear run in the eight path at the furlong marker and closed with a rush but could not get there in time. TREBUCHET had a good trip
nestled behind the engaged trio throughout the turn, rallied up the fence in upper stretch and finished up with intent, closing in, but unfortunately was on the
losing end of a three way photo for the place share. TODAY travelled in mid-pack four deep down the backside, started to rally five wide being floated out at
the quarter pole, was in range of the leaders in the eight path turning for home, battled on stubbornly to the wire but needed a little more late to pose a threat
at the finish. WHADDYA MEAN watched the contesting trio battle four wide down the backside, took closer order to the leaders four wide through the turn,
angled out to the seven path for the drive to the finish line with a chance for a piece of the prize, fought gamely between others at the furlong pole but gave
way losing his path in deep stretch. MIAH SAID prompted the pace with runners on each side down the back straight, continued to argue for the lead
between foes around the turn, was still in the mix three wide at the top of the lane but yielded in the final furlong. ABSOLUTE CHAIRMAN had a slim
advantage three deep outside down the backstretch, battled for the lead three wide through the turn, was in range in the five path in upper stretch, had to be
steadied losing his lane at the sixteenth pole between horses and could not recover to pose a threat. CADFAEL pressed the pace inside down the
backstretch, dueled on the rail up front around the bend, could not find more turning for home and was engulfed by rivals on either side at the furlong
marker. JUST FOR MADDIE broke in at the start, was checked mildly between foes at the three eighths pole, made no headway on others through the turn
and could no be a presence in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
GHOUL (BRZ) quickly moved clear, set the pace from the two path, was kept to the task and held. FORESTER'S TURN was bumped at the start, switched
out racing off the pace, was forced to take the overland route going six to seven wide out of the turn, gained steadily on the winner but needed more.
HIGHLAND SOCIETY tracked up close, saved ground inside, secured show honors. COMMANDER JOE chased from about three to four wide coming to
the top of the stretch between foes, got the nod for the super. WENJACK settled off the pace inside, came out eight wide in the stretch and continued to drift
out late while gaining mildly. BIG INVESTMENT was up close stalking four wide through the turn, needed more late. GRAND ALLIANCE pursued from
outside five wide through the turn, failed to rally. EXECUTIVE SIGHT bumped a rival and steadied at the start, was outrun.

Footnotes
ROYAL HUDSON had a good position outside tracking the contesting duo down the backstretch, patiently began to reel in the leaders into the turn, pounced
to the lead three wide at the quarter pole and continued to fight on up front down the lane just holding off numerous runners at the wire for the win.
DESTINY RO could see this field down the backstretch, started to reach for more ground passing foes on the rail at the quarter pole, shifted to the three
path to be in the hunt at the top of the stretch, weaved in and out looking for path down the lane and just missed timing the final surge for the win at the wire.
CANTUCCI travelled in the third flight on the inside in the early stages, moved in smartly at the three furlong marker to be a menacing presence four wide at
the quarter pole and ran on willingly between horses in deep stretch to just save show at the finish line. RED SNEAKERS was unhurried ahead of one rival
down the backstretch, closed the gap on the tiring leaders with three eighths left to run, loomed five wide at the top of the lane and finished up mildly inching
closer at the wire. BAR TALK was steadied on the start, stalked on the outside in the third flight down the back straight, was asked for more three furlongs
from home, offered little response on the turn, shifted out six wide for the drive and gaining quickly on the leaders in the final furlong but ran out of room.
RED ENSIGN broke outwards on the start, tracked on the rail down the backside, was roused at the three furlong pole but could not go on with others
making a run and was one paced on the rail in the stretch drive. COMPUTER HACKER veered out on the break, recovered to hound the leader outside in
the first turn, forced the pace outside down the backstretch, chased in vain on the final turn and emptied out turning for home. VALYRIAN SKY cleared to
the rail leading this pack into the first turn, set a brisk pace while shadowed outside down the back straight, was collared outside at the quarter pole, had
nothing left to give and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
YORKVILLE was forwardly-positioned tracking inside, switched out on the turn, was guided four wide and put to urging past the quarter pole, gained
steadily, bid between runners late and got the nod. HIP TO YOUR TRICKS settled mid-pack outside, advanced five wide on the turn, gained steadily in the
stretch, missed. AIR FORCE RESERVE stalked from outside, moved three wide to take the lead outside the five-sixteenths, lugged in a bit in upper stretch,
was challenged by an inside foe in mid-stretch, successfully outdueled that one but lost the nod to rallying foes outside. TWIXTER attended the pace from
inside, saved ground on the turn moving through inside to bid by mid-stretch, was outkicked. SNOOKERED was allowed to settle, saved ground inside on
the turn, waited briefly at the quarter pole, got through inside in upper stretch, was guided out a bit gaining on the leaders but lacked room in behind those at
the wire. SOCIAL JUSTICE broke just a half-step slowly, was off the pace and forced five wide on the turn, swung out eight deep for the drive, ran on. BILL
NEEDLE dropped back three wide between runners early, shifted seven wide turning into upper stretch, ran on. THE SWAYZE EXPRESS was quick to the
lead, set the pace from off the rail, tired. DAWSON SILVER stalked from between runners mid-pack early, was guided out further off the inside, failed to
rally. BUTWAITTHERE'SMORE fanned ten wide into the stretch, was not a threat.

Footnotes
RY PIE had a nice position watching the top two going into the turn, was patiently nestled behind on the rail waiting for his cue, burst up the fence to seize
control at the two furlong pole and was kept to the task down the lane to hold rivals at bay comfortably crossing the line. GLORIOUS REVENGE took
command from the onset, dictated the pace unopposed on the turn, was headed inside by the winner at the quarter pole, offered little resistance turning for
home home but stubbornly fought on and prevailed holding for second at the finish line. SQUEEZETHESHARMAN was brushed outside on the break,
settled in mid-pack on the rail down the backside, crept closer to the leaders on the rail through the turn and determinedly finished up on the rail down the
lane just missing the photo for place at the wire. PERFECT FOREST broke inwards at the start, co-trailed on the fence at the half, could not keep up with
others through the turn, found his best stride late and was closing sharply going by runners strongly in the last sixteenth. GALACTIC GLORY had a good
spot tracking three wide outside of horses, loomed boldly four wide outside at the quarter pole, did not switch leads until late inside the eighth pole and
faded in deep stretch. WETIKO was bumped outside at the start, settled in midfield on the outside in the beginning, kept pace with the leaders throughout
the turn and was getting closer, improving on foes down the stretch to be involved for the minor share in the end. VISITOR'S WELCOME was content to
track behind the pacesetter down the back straight, chased between runners going around the oval, could not find another gear by mid-stretch and gave
way in the final furlong. CALLYOUBACKINFIVE bobbled soon after the start to trail down the backside, closed the gap travelling three wide between rivals
on the turn, shifted six wide for the drive but could not get involved through the lane. PERSEVERE broke inwards at the start, stalked outside near the back
down the backside, made no impact two wide between running on the turn and lacked a rally in the stretch to the wire. QURBAAN'S KINGDOM stalked near
the rear in the early going, made little impression inside foes around the bend and could not be a factor running to the finish line. ASHUKA co-trailed three
deep outside at the half, made a brief turn of foot rallying four wide improving around horses through the turn but could not offer much in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
CUPID'S CLAWS was unhurried settling at the back shifting in about two wide into the first turn, bided time till the far turn then made swift advance outside
five to six wide, powered past in mid-stretch and held sway. EMBRACE MY UNCLE tucked in early saving ground through the first turn racing off the pace,
switched out and advanced about five deep on the far turn, was second best. SUNRISE DRIVE was well-placed about mid-pack three to four wide, moved
out a bit for the drive, ran on. PALIO tracked from inside saving ground, needed more. VANBRUGH bumped a rival at the start, quickly moved clear,
dictated the pace racing off the rail, was challenged in the stretch and yielded. DERZKII raced mostly four wide and went evenly. C C'S KINGDOM was
caught five wide outside foes through the first turn, took closer order three to four deep on the far turn, was within range turning for home but evened out
late. HELL BENT was forwardly-positioned stalking about three wide, ridden along three furlongs out but had no late response. OCTOBER FROST was
bumped at the start, in tight entering the first turn racing at the rear and inside, moved out on the far turn, came into upper stretch eight to nine deep, ran on
but was not a threat. JUST START ME UP was two to three wide between foes mid-division early, dropped back, was guided out about seven wide turning
for home, failed to rally. NEWPORT AGENT raced outside toward the back mostly four wide through the turns but was floated out ten deep leaving the far
bend, failed to rally. SIR SAHIB broke a step slowly and steadied when in tight coming out of the gate, coaxed forward to track from inside, came up empty.

Footnotes
THREE SONNY SIDEUP tracked in the second flight down the backside, angled out off the tiring early leaders to loom four wide turning for home, bumped
fellow rival when set down at the furlong pole dueling for the lead and under left handed encouragement drifted out late to hold on for the win a photo.
COACH ABERNATHY travelled on the rail in mid-pack in the early going, stalked all alone in the third flight down the backstretch, shifted outside closing the
gap quickly three wide at the quarter pole, bid for the lead five wide at the top of the stretch, exchanged bumps with inside rival driving to the wire at the
eighth pole and lost the battle for the win while being pushed out late by the winner nearing the finish line. MISTER MESEEKS stalked near the back of the
pack saving ground in the first turn, advanced mildly on the fence down the back straight, was urged for more with five sixteenths to go, angled outside in
the five path with run straightening out for home and closed outside, smartly going by runners late but could not threaten the top two at the wire and settled
for a clear third in the end. TOURIST'S DREAM was bumped at the start, clipped heels going into the first turn, began to inch closer to the leaders while in
hand inside at the quarter pole and rallied late to close in for a minor share in the end. BAYTOWN ELVIS broke in at the start, had a mild lead in the first
turn, bobbed heads for the lead running inside down the backstretch, fought on for the lead on the rail turning for home, could not find more late and tired at
the sixteenth pole. SOCIETY JOE prompted the pace outside on the first turn, continued to hound the leader outside down the backstretch, still battled up
front in upper stretch but weakened between rivals in the last sixteenth. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE was allowed to settle on the fence trailing in the early
parts of the race, started to gain some run on the rail on the final turn and had good late energy inside to pass some rivals down the stretch. MUSKOKA
GIANT was brushed inside at the start, stared to gain on others outside four deep down the backside, put in a brief run four wide circling at the three furlong
pole, angled out in the six path at the top of the lane, could not go on and flattened out in mid-stretch. SILENT LUCIDITY was brushed outside on the break,
stalked near the back with runners on either side down the backstretch, made a mild run four wide on the final turn but could not play a role running down
the stretch. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) was tucked in on the rail behind the leaders for most of the race, was in range just behind the fading early leaders
turning for home but could not offer a finish in deep stretch to pose a threat in the end. KITTEN'S BOY stalked three wide near the rear in the first turn, could
not gain on rivals down the backstretch, angled out widest in the eight path for the drive to the line but could not get into contention running to the wire.
THUNDERHEAVYRAIN settled on the outside in the third flight early on, made little progression between horses along the backstretch, could not keep up
with others midway on the final turn and had nothing to show in the stretch drive. RCOF #2 COACH ABERNATHY AGAINST #7 THREE SONNY SIDEUP

Footnotes
SMOKIN HOLIDAY stalked from outside, went five wide on the turn, bid in mid-stretch, powered clear. MANETKA stalked from between runners off the
leading pair into the turn, went three wide through much of that bend, was encouraged along three furlongs out, tipped out five wide at the top of the stretch,
kept on evenly and held place. SING DIXIE settled off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, kept on inside a rival late but missed second.
DISCOVERY CHART settled outside four to five wide in the back half of the field, came out further in the stretch, kept on. HOLIDAY IN CHILE switched out,
raced wide and toward the rear into the turn, fanned widest to the nine path turning for home, gained late. TONKA WAKAN was unhurried early, moved out
from two to four wide on the turn then came out a bit further in the stretch, gained late. BROTHER BELEN pursued from between runners four wide on the
turn, checked in behind tiring foes and was blocked from about the eighth pole, altered out at the sixteenth pole but was too little too late. NGABE settled off
the pace, saved ground inside, came out a bit in the stretch, kicked on mildly. WICKEDBLACKBULLET moved forward inside to the lead after the gap and
opening furlong, set the pace inside hounded by a foe, was challenged and overtaken late on the turn, vied inside that runner, weakened in the stretch.
POLA STAR had the early lead then settled in to press a rival from outside, retook a narrow advantage dueling two to three wide late on the turn, weakened
in the stretch while drifting in and out a bit. DIXIE'S FLATTER was simply outpaced. GET READY SET FIRE broke outwardly, was forwardly-placed tracking
inside on or just off the rail, steadily retreated.
