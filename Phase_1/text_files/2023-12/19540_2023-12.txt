Footnotes
TWELVE STARS started in the middle of the pack then moved to the rail and made a move but in doing so drifted out and impeded foes. HALOSNHEAVEN
ran off pace from the leaders then was disturbed in the stretch by foe. LOVE TANK ran in the back of the pack then had a late rally at the eighth pole.
BIRDIE CURDY had good early speed then shuffled back throughout the race. PRESENT TIME set the early pace then coming down the stretch foe came
from the inside and impeded the path. WON SASSY RIDE ran in the back of the pack then had a late bid at the quarter pole. FOOLISH DELIGHT ran in the
back of the pack had a slight gain at the sixteenth pole. PRINCESS JAYLEEN ran at the back of the pack then faded at the quarter pole. CAROLYN'S WAY
passed wire walked off. THERE WAS TWO TRAINERS OBJECTIONS BOTH CALLED ON TWELVE STARS FOR DRIFTING IN AND IMPEDING THE
PATH OF FOES, AFTER THE STEWARDS REVIEW THEY DISQUALFIED TWELVE STARS TO FIFTH FOR IMPEDING THE PATH OF FOES.
