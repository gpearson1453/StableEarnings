Footnotes
ROSES ARE FREE took command from the start, put away the early pace foe with five sixteenths to go, braced for the new challenger outside at the
quarter pole, had another gear in upper stretch to open up by the furlong marker and comfortably held safe at the finish. FEW REGRETS stalked near the
rear on the inside in the early going, closed in shifting outside of runners midpoint through the turn, angled inwards from the three path to the rail by
mid-stretch and closed in smartly late for the place share in deep stretch. MOET MONET prompted the pace three deep outside foes down the backstretch,
took closer order midturn, bid for the lead just outside at the quarter pole, was repelled by the frontrunning winner in upper stretch, chased but to no avail to
the wire and faded late losing second money just before the finish line. TATOOSONMYSOUL veered outwards on the break, settled in mid-pack three wide
down the backstretch, was asked for more with five sixteenths to go, offered little rally and was one paced on the fence to the wire for a minor share.
DEFAMATION was pinched between horses soon after the start, stalked near the back having one rival beaten down the backstretch, lost ground to the
field around the bend and showed good late interest picking up tired foes in the lane. FEROCIOUS QUEEN was unhurried to trail down the backside, made
little headway throughout the turn, could not get involved down the lane but did pass a tiring rival in the stretch. PEACE IN PARADISE chased the pace
between runners down the back straight. could not match strides with the top two midpoint on the turn and retreated with runners on either side in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
BAREFOOT SERVANTU was under a strong hold inside watching the front duo down the backstretch, was trapped on the rail behind the front pair when
outside rivals started to make a move at the half, waited to pounce in the two path behind the leaders on the far turn, angled in to the fence for the drive to
the finish and drew away convincingly by mid-stretch for the impressive score. MUCHO MISSTIQUE was squeezed slightly at the start, was allowed to settle
down the backside making little progress, rallied four wide around horses with five sixteenths to run, loomed in the six path straightening out for home and
bested the rest in a three way duel for place down the stretch. ALMONTE PRINCESS veered out bumping foe on the break, rated kindly galloping along on
the fence at the half, waited with horse through the far turn and rallied up the fence down the lane to just miss winning the three way battle for second at the
finish. BLACKMARSH was situated on the outside near the back five wide entering the first turn, stalked outside rivals in the third flight down the backside,
moved in taking closer aim three deep at the half mile marker, was in the hunt five wide at the top of the lane and finished up gamely between runners
battling for place but settled on the fringes in a photo at the wire. RUMOURS FLY travelled four wide tracking outside on the first turn, settled on the outside
in the second flight down the back straight, was nudged to go on with three furlongs remaining, could not quicken with others around the final turn and
passed the tiring early pacesetters through the lane. SLOANS SKY was under a good hold on the fence taking this field into the first turn, continued up front
with mild pressure outside down the backstretch, was clinging onto the lead inside at the quarter pole and was engulfed by runners on either side in upper
stretch. STANDING STRONG broke outwards on the start, pressed the issue outside in the early stages, bid for the lead in the three path in upper stretch
with rivals on each side, could not find more by the furlong marker and weakened to the finish line. CLASSIC GLORY broke inwards bumping inside foe at
the start, trailed through the backstretch, caught up to the field six wide turning for home but could not offer a finish to be a factor driving to the wire.

Footnotes
MASON'S MUSIC broke inwards at the start, settled on the fence near the rear down the backside, patiently weaved her way through runners advancing at
the quarter pole, burst between foes with an eighth left to run and got up in time just before the finish line. MARDENE assumed command leading the field
under soft fractions down the backside and through the turn, was clinging onto the lead in the two path with closers on each side in upper stretch and
bravely fought to the wire just giving way to the winner a few jumps before the line. MO TOUGH tracked outside in the beginning, prompted the pace at the
half, posed a serious threat four wide between horses driving to the finish line but was outfinished in deep stretch settling for the show award. ELLA
FRANCES was content to track inside down the back straight, waited to move nestled on the rail behind the pacesetter around the oval, inched closer to the
leaders on the fence at the sixteenth to be in the mix of things up front but needed more late and faded some to be a minor player in the end. ALL FOR
HONOR was void of speed trailing the pack down the backside, could see the compact field saving ground through the turn, was aching for room behind
runners down the lane but could not get a clear path to extend her stride in deep stretch. GHOSTLY PERFECTION stalked outside near the rear in the early
going, offered a brief run four wide in midturn to the top of the lane to be widest in the six path in upper stretch, could not sustain the run evened out in the
final eighth. TRILLING SONG was pushed in by the outside runner at the break, settled outside rivals in mid-pack down the backside, improved around
runners three wide through the turn, was a menacing presence outside in the five path at the top of the stretch but levelled out at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
COLOR FORCE attended the early pace then applied further pressure up the backstretch from outside three deep, took the lead at the seven-sixteenths,
moved clear by the midpoint of the turn, held sway while being kept to the task. WICKED MIAH settled outside at the rear racing four then five wide on the
turn, kept on six deep in the stretch but was second best. LIPLOCK dropped back off the leading trio in the early stages shifting in a bit racing mid-pack into
the turn, went in the two then three path on that bend, came out four to five wide for the drive, went evenly late. MORE SAVVY got away slowly then was
strongly urged forward inside, made the lead after the opening quarter but was soon overtaken, continued in pursuit just in behind the leader, lacked the
needed late kick. ENDORPHIN RUSH raced inside at the rear, saved ground through the turn, was not a threat. STORMY SUZIE was between foes at the
rear early, went three to four wide on the turn, swung out seven to eight deep for the stretch run, failed to produce a bid. WAKE UP MAGGIE had a narrow
lead for nearly the opening quarter, vied briefly between runners, dropped back, faded.

Footnotes
DRESDEN ROW was away alertly leading down the backstretch unopposed, pulled away from the chasing trio by midturn and held safe down the stretch
under a hand ride to the wire. SHERIF ALI broke outwards having a sluggish start to begin, was checked mildly between foes in midfield at the five eighths
marker, edged closer to the pacesetter on the fence throughout the turn, posed the only threat to the winner turning for home but could not reel in that rival
who had more left in reserve in deep stretch. FAITHFUL CREEK was bumped on the break, settled at the back of the pack with a half mile to run, slipped up
the inside improving on the fence through the turn and rallied on the rail down the stretch to be a distant third in the end. BREAK THE SPELL was bumped
at the start, tracked three deep outside horses down the backside, made no gain on the winner when urged three wide around the bend and just missed
when dueling for third money through the stretch. FABELMAN broke inwards at the start, had one rival beaten stalking outside runners at the half, was
scrubbed on for more three wide at the three furlong marker, offered little run and could not be a menace through the stretch drive. CODE OMAHA chased
the frontrunning winner down the backstretch, was under a hard ride trying to maintain position between horses through the turn, could not go on by the
quarter pole, backed away and had little to show in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
TRUE TEMPER had forward position tracking from inside, was guided out four deep in upper stretch with aim on the leader, drove the fore seventy yards
from home and cleared. JAZZ HANDS exchanged minor contact at the start, quickly moved clear setting the pace from off the rail, was outkicked, held
place. MESSIER was outsprinted in the early going racing between foes at the back, was under urging while tipping out five wide turning for home, was
gaining fast but too late. JOURNEYMAN settled outside at the back, went mostly four wide on the turn, swung out seven to eight deep for the drive, gained
late. SOUPER WATSON chased from between runners four then five wide on the turn, came in a bit in upper stretch and ran on. CITY MISCHIEF veered
out at the start, chased from outside and within range five to six wide on the turn, evened out. RED RIVER REBEL moved up and steadied slightly on heels
near the five-eighths racing inside and off the leaders, saved ground improving position into upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. ONE BAY
HEMINGWAY exchanged minor contact at the start, chased from between foes three to four deep, weakened. KINETIC STONE exchanged minor contact at
the start, moved forward between runners keen to go on, pursued from between foes, dropped back on the turn.

Footnotes
MACHINA could see the field finding her stride down the back straight, began to pick up horses smartly four wide circling at the quarter pole, loomed the
main threat in the six path widest turning for home and was full of run late to draw off in deep stretch with the impressive closing kick. RAVELLO BEAUTY
trailed the field in the early going, improved some passing the eventual winner down the backside, rallied sharply three wide around horses five sixteenths
from home to be in range in the five path at the top of the lane, was no match dueling with the winner at the furlong marker and gamely fought on still to
capture the runners up share near the wire. WORLDLY BEAUTY cleared from the outside to take command on the rail entering the backstretch, continued
to dictate terms along the backside, opened up mildly on the chasing duo at the quarter pole, was collared outside with a furlong to go, offered no resistance
and gave way in deep stretch to be a clear third on the fence at the wire. ASHBURY bobbled on the break, recouped to watch the front two tracking outside
rivals down the backstretch, was coaxed on the fence to go after the leader at the quarter pole, was in the hunt in the two path in upper stretch, could not go
on with the top three finishers at the furlong marker and faded late holding for a minor role in the end. ARRIVISTE broke with the field to begin but was slow
to get going soon afterwards, travelled alone in the third flight down the back straight, offered a mild turn of foot two wide midway on the turn, was urged left
handed while getting in through the lane and could no make any impression in deep stretch. UMNEYAAT tracked in the second flight on the fence down the
backside, was roused on the rail losing ground to the leaders with three eighths remaining, could not make any impression through the far turn and lacked a
rally on the rail down the stretch. DIOSA CATRINA was reined back from the rail to track outside with three quarters to go, pushed the pace outside through
the backstretch, was asked for more trying to keep pace with the frontrunner at the three furlong marker, had little to give by the quarter pole, yielded to
others in upper stretch and was eased crossing the finish line.

Footnotes
MOONBRIGHT took command down the backside clearing off to get the rail, continued to set the fractions with little pressure around the turn, opened up on
rivals turning for home and was kept to the task to hold safe through the stretch. SWEET NOLA stalked outside near the last flight four deep outside runners
down the back, started to make a move circling around rivals five wide at the quarter pole and rallied gamely down the stretch to get up at the wire to
capture second money. THATSITTHATSALL was away a step slow to begin, recovered quickly to track on the rail down the back straight, was checked
mildly in tight on the fence at the seven sixteenths marker, had a chance while in the hunt on the fence in upper stretch and gave way late losing the place
share between horses in a tight picture at the finish. GOLD FORESTER hopped on the break to trail at the start, was hustled for better inside position on the
fence at the half, had to be throttled down when on heels behind a rival with seven sixteenths from home and offered a good stretch run on the inside at the
furlong pole but was on the losing end of a three way photo for the place share. MOUNTAIN SOUND was nudged trying to maintain position in midfield
down the backside, was hard ridden on the turn but was shuffled back to co-trail on the inside at the quarter pole and showed some good late energy on the
fence to pass tired rivals in deep stretch. ROOKIE COURT chased the pacesetter outside down the backstretch, continued to hound the frontrunner outside
through the turn, was in range if good enough in the three path straightening out for the drive but faded between runners in the final sixteenth. GOLDEN
TRAIN tracked the front pack outside foes down the backside, kept pace with the frontrunning winner throughout the turn and faded steadily down the lane
never switching leads until very deep in the stretch in the three to four path. WAR'S END KISS travelled in mid-pack early on, could see the field with
runners on each side at the half mile marker, could not get involved running outside horses around the bend, angled out widest in the six path at the top of
the stretch but could not be a factor to the finish line.
