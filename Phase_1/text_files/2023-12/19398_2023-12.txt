Footnotes
SUDDEN SHIFT hopped at the start, was the distant trailer down the backside, rallied into the turn to close ground on the field and closed with a rush down
the lane to be up in time. RRACE DAY WARRIOR pressed the pace from the fence to the turn, battled from the inside in a three horse duel to the quarter
pole, shook clear in mid-stretch and was caught in the shadow of the wire in a game effort. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL stalked the leaders into the far turn,
circled four wide to loom turning for home and kept-on through the lane while failing to gain ground. MAXIMIZER tracked the pace down the backstretch,
made a three wide bid in the turn to take a brief lead and weakened in the stretch. DEBDURITE set a pressured pace from two wide between horses to the
three-eighths pole and faded coming home. SAY HEY KID was never a threat. POWER (BRZ) was not a factor.

Footnotes
MY TWO AUNT JOANS tracked the leaders into the turn, rallied four wide through the turn, engaged the leaders from the seven path in mid-stretch, drifted
in through the lane causing CRYO to clip heels in deep stretch and pulled clear to the wire. MONTAUK COVE set the pace from the fence to midway on the
bend, was over-taken in a three way duel on the turn and kept-on willingly along the fence through the stretch. THE COOKIE MAN pressed the pace to the
turn, took command from three wide nearing the quarter pole, bumped with CRYO in upper stretch and weakened in the stretch drive. UNCLEJACKOMO
went evenly while never posing a threat. TWO GUNS raced at the rear of the field into the turn, steadied along the fence when commencing rally at the
three-eighths pole, dropped out of contention and lost rider when jumped the fallen rider off CRYO in the stretch while finishing evenly. CRYO dueled
between rivals on the lead through the turn, bumped rival upper stretch, took the lead, passed by closing winner who drifted in causing him to clip heels and
unseat his rider in the lane. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND UPON REVIEW DISQUALIFIED THE WINNER
AND PLACED HIM FOURTH.

Footnotes
SHELL FIRE slow early to trail the field, raced wide in the clear down the backstretch, rallied steadily from five wide midway on the turn, angled to the eight
path at the head of the lane, and found his best stride late to be up in time at the wire. SMASH set the pace on a clear lead to midway down the lane and
was caught in the final yards by the fast closing winner. FRANCO reserved off the pace through the turn, saved ground rallying along the fence in the stretch
and was gaining late. BOURBON OVER ICE raced wide in the first turn, settled to stalk the pacesetter to upper stretch and kept on through the lane
willingly. TUSKEGEE CAT tracked the pace from three wide under stout restraint down the backside while in striking position, bumped rival turning for home
and failed to gain in the stretch drive. SKIDSTREAM well placed along the rail just off the leader to the far turn, made a bid up the inside to the quarter pole
and finished evenly. DON'T POKE THE CAT well placed through the turn, rallied turning for home, exchanged bumps in upper stretch and flattened out.
SCAT SHACK failed to menace. TAMANRASSETT was never a threat.

BACKATYA set the pace while under pressure, briefly surrendered the lead turning for home, repelled the challenger in upper stretch, shook clear in
mid-stretch and held the closer safe at the wire in a game effort. STATESBORO slow early to trail well off the rear of the body of the field, made a steady
advance turning for home and finished well with a belated rally. DOCTOR WU pressed the pace from three wide, briefly took the lead while rallying at the
top of the stretch and finished willingly while not quite well enough. OVER THE HILLS raced prominently throughout, drifted wide down the lane while
mounting a rally and finished evenly in deep stretch. FREEDOM RIDER flashed early speed to be on the pace, settled off the leaders down the backside
and failed to gain ground in the stretch drive. SUMMERFEST rallied in the turn from four wide and flattened out in upper stretch.

DANCE DRAMA prompted the pace into the turn, rallied three wide to assume command turning for home and drew off in the lane. PENNY'S TREASURE
reserved off the pace along the fence through the turn, angled three wide in upper stretch and finished willingly to be up for the place. HALO EFFECT broke
outward to bump rivals away from the gate, tracked the leaders from wide to the top of the lane, angled five wide and made steady progress through the
lane. DEE'S KY WILDCAT slow early to trail, worked his way to the outside in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. TOTAL SMOKESHOW was knocked
sideways leaving the gate when inside rival broke outward, raced mid-pack throughout and showed some late interest. TITEBLUEJEANS unhurried for the
first half and rallied mildly in the lane. RUBY LAYNE set the pace from the rail to the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. BONNIE'S BEST bumped at
the start, raced near the rear of the field and failed to menace. SWEET AS MERRIE pressed the pace from between rivals for a half mile and gave way.
MACHEN REIGNS was never a factor.

EPICUREAN broke alertly to take command from the gate, set a well rated early pace, opened a clear advantage on the bend and widened at will through
the lane as much best. BACKSPLASH rallied between rivals entering the turn and finished willingly as second best while unable to threaten the winner.
JOYFUL NOISE raced four wide into the turn while commencing a rally in a long drive and finished evenly in the lane. SPLASH OF TONIC rallied from the
rail in the turn, tipped around the stopping rival on the bend and was unable to sustain his bid in the stretch. HIGH SPEED showed brief speed to press the
pace for a half mile and was through early.

BAREBACK FUN broke alertly to take the lead from the gate, set a pressured pace to the quarter pole, responded when called upon and drew off through
the lane. JEN'S BATTLE slow early to trail the field, angled six wide at the top of the lane and closed well finding her best stride late to be up for the place.
TIZ INDEPENDENCE unhurried in the early going, rallied from four wide in the stretch while splitting rivals with a late gain. CEVICHE well placed while
saving ground along the fence and failed to gain ground in the stretch. SWEET QUEEN BEE hustled early to press the pace and flattened out turning for
home. FLATTERY'S MUSIC stalked the pacesetters while racing three wide through the turn and weakened in the lane. HERO'S DAUGHTER was never a
threat. BLAZING ZENNA contended for the first half and dropped back as a non-factor.

Footnotes
EXONERATED PREZ stalked the pace from the fence down the backside, tipped out two wide in the far turn to engage the leader, took command in
mid-stretch while drifting out and finished determinedly to hold the closers safe. ALEXIS N NIKO was caught wide on the first turn, settled off the pace down
the backside, commenced a five wide rally in the final bend and closed well down the stretch while widest of all. MAYITO moved up late on the first turn to
be wide, tracked the leaders down the backside, made a four wide bid in the turn to be prominent in upper stretch, had to angle inside the drifting leader
through the lane and kept coming late. STRASBOURG tracked the leaders from the fence, saved ground cutting the corner turning for home and finished
willingly. MASTER opened a clear lead down the backside, maintained that lead through the turn, responded well when challenged in upper stretch and kept
on down the lane in a good try. FISHING FOR FUN chased the pacesetter for a half mile from three wide and gradually faded. LONG RAP SHEET was well
placed and went evenly lacking a response. KING SOCIAL trailed most of the way and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. RUBINSTEIN was never a threat.
LUCKY SMILE steadied briefly turning on to the backstretch and dropped out as a non-factor.
