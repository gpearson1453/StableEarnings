Footnotes
HAMMER stalked inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep approaching the top of the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and held
on well. DUBAI FIRE took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the quarter,
was met at the rail nearing the head of the lane and remained a close factor through the upper stretch before flattening stride. SISYPHUS stalked the early
pace off the rail, gave chase leaving the five eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and showed little more. RAINBOW DAY raced in the four
path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and showed little more. DEE DEE SIX saved ground
and showed little response. VIBRANT FORCE became anxious in the gate, raced well off the pace in the three path the opening turn and proved no factor.
COOLKID raced in the five path the first turn and was through early.

on the far turn and was kept sharp in the lane. BONNIE BLUETOOTH stalked from the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn at the rail and ran evenly in the stretch. URKILLINGMEBETH raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and flattened in the lane. PUPPYMONKEYBABY saved early ground, picked up the chase past the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, left the turn outside and showed little more. CICI UNIFIED settled off the rail the opening turn, picked up the
chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. CHINA CAT saved ground. MARKETABILITY broke a step
slow and never factored. MAKE IT A DOUBLE rounded the first turn about the four path then faded past the three eighths pole.

SUMMONING DENIS settled inside, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and
took the nod in the final yards. ESPRESSO raced with the pace from the seven eighths pole while alternating the lead with LEG UP, dueled clear of that one
toward the head of the lane, dug in under steady stretch handling but was caught in the final yards. The latter stalked the early pace and alternated the lead
with Espresso throughout most of the race, but dropped back at the rail nearing the head of the lane and flattened the final sixteenth. LIEUTENANT
BROWN stalked from the four path early, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn then flattened in the lane.
TREASURER raced in the three path early then saved ground, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened in
the lane. AIR MEDAL bobbled leaving the gate and dropped well back.

ELLE'SBIGSEACRET pressured the pace through the backstretch and raced at even terms two deep at the quarter pole, contested the edge through the
turn, dug in to clear Wild Behavior mid-stretch and was taken in hand nearing the wire. GOLDEN G chased through the backstretch, steadied off the heels
of Royal Mahogany at the rail past the quarter pole, came inside that one midway on the turn, angled three wide into the lane, dug in to take second late
strides and finished well at the outside girth of the winner. WILD BEHAVIOR raced with the pace through the backstretch, contested at a close disadvantage
nearest the rail on the turn then dropped back toward mid-stretch and flattened stride. ADVANCE CASH gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path
and flattened late yards. MOCEPHUS engaged in close early chase, rounded the turn in the six path and weakened in the lane. ROYAL MAHOGANY raced
with the contested pace through the backstretch but checked at the rail into the turn and faded through the turn. MUNDO MIX broke a step slow, proved no
factor and raced wide on the turn. MISCHIEVOUS JESSE gave close early chase then flattened in the five path on the turn.

Footnotes
BARRELHOUSE stalked the early pace two deep then took the lead into the backstretch, urged clear nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on
the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. NET WORTH saved early ground, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
about the four path and dug in to clear second inside the sixteenth pole. DOWSING ROD was hustled along with the early pace, gave up the lead into the
backstretch and engaged in close chase from that point, but dropped back at the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened past
the eighth pole. REMASTERED came away awkwardly and exchanged contact with Smokin Smitty leaving the gate, rounded the first turn about the three
path and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and weakened. BUKOVEL settled in the three path the first turn,
picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path on the far turn. SMOKIN SMITTY exchanged contact with Remastered
leaving the gate, rounded the opening turn in the four path and showed little response through the backstretch.
