Footnotes
BORN NOBLE stalked in the five path, bid from the four path midway around the turn, swept to the lead while lugging in on his left lead going by the eighth
pole, switched before the sixteenth, and continued to draw clear. BIG CITY prompted the pace in the two path, backed up along the rail midway around the
turn, angled out to the five path in upper stretch, rebroke, and kept on while on his left lead for place. BONUS MOVE bobbled at the start, set the pace in the
four path, was coaxed from the two path when challenged by an outer foe midway around the turn, lost the lead at the top of the stretch, tipped out to the
three path, and faded in the final furlong to show. BAIL US OUT trailed in the four path early, was driven around the turn, and made no impact while
improving position inside of foes down the lane. MO GO broke in and bumped an inner foe, tracked in the three path, was roused between foes into the turn,
but flattened in the stretch. PRINCETOWN got bumped by an outer foe at the start, rated in the four path but failed to bid from the five path down the lane.
STARSHIP MOCHA chased in the six path but came up empty entering the stretch. DANELAND raced wellback in the five path and never menaced.

Footnotes
K CROWN set the early pace in the two path, settled into a stalking position early on the backstretch when GO GO GE became intent on the lead, stalked
the in the two path around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane, regained command near the sixteenth pole and
fought off a stubborn MY LIFE STORY late. MY LIFE STORY broke outwardly, raced in range five wide around the first turn, bid three deep rounding the far
turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, was collared by the winner near the sixteenth pole, fought on inside to the wire and
appeared to be narrowing the gap late. OLD FLAG (IRE) raced in range three and four wide, exchanged bumps with RAPSCALLION between the quarter
pole and the three-sixteenths marker, bumped with REGGAE MAN near the sixteenth pole and kept on to gain the show. REGGAE MAN raced well back
two wide, advanced five wide around the far turn, rallied outside, bumped near the sixteenth pole and improved position late. RAPSCALLION raced in range
inside early, settled back down the backstretch, angled three wide entering the far turn, exchanged bumps with OLD FLAG late on the turn and in upper
stretch and faded. JABRAN prompted the pace three and four wide and tired in the drive. HE'S A COMMISIONER failed to menace while racing two and
three wide. GO GO GE was forced out at the start, raced six wide around the first turn, moved to the front early on the backstretch, cleared and angled in
midway down the straight, led at the rail to the quarter pole and faltered. MAGNETIC APPEAL was outrun while racing two wide.

VARIABLE COST (GB) broke out and brushed with an outer foe, laid up close in the three path, was roused passing the three-eighths, bid passing the
quarter, dueled with an inner foe from the three path down the stretch, and prevailed. I AM THE GAME stalked in the two path, was roused to bid along the
rail going into the turn, held a short lead in the two path at the top of the stretch, dug in gamely on his left lead while dueling with an outer foe, but lost the
bob to finish with place honors. MAKE 'EM TAP tracked in the four path, was ridden into the far turn, tipped out to the five path turning into the lane, and
finished evenly for show. ENSIGN SKIP got bumped by an inner foe, then bumped with an outer foe twice at the start, chased in the three path, swung out
to the six path under a drive turning into the stretch, but made no impact. ARAMOS bumped hard with an inner foe twice at the start, trailed in the five path,
fanned out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and did not factor. MATEO rated along the inside but weakened in the stretch. CIRCLE THE MOON set
the pace in the four path, was challenged on both sides in the two path midway around the far turn, and gaveway at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
MARKSMAN QUEEN (GB) set the the pace inside, dug in when HOLA GATA reached even terms in midstretch and refused to let that foe get past. HOLA
GATA settled off the pace while racing two wide between foes, bid in midstretch, reached even terms outside of the winner leaving the eighth pole, dueled to
the wire and just missed. EXCELLENT QUESTION stalked the pace inside, steadied near the quarter pole then re-rallied to gain the show late. STARSHIP
AURORA raced off the pace two and three wide, swung widest in upper stretch and improved position. SWOOP TO FINISH raced in range three wide and
weakened in the stretch. OLYMPIC PRANK prompted the winner two wide and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
MARYQUITECONTRARY rated in the three path, was roused in the two path midway around the turn, swung out to the five path turning into the lane, and
rallied to draw past an inner foe in the final sixteenth. IMONRA prompted the pace in the four path, was cued to bid midway around the turn, ran on from the
three path into the stretch, took the lead passing the sixteenth pole, but was quickly caught by an outer foe to place. UNIFYING tracked in the four path, but
had to wait and got shuffled back while between foes in the three path passing the quarter, was cued along the inside into the lane, angled outward into the
final furlong, and kept on for show. ROSIE'S HALO stalked in the five path, was coaxed passing the half, floated out to the six path turning into the stretch,
but flattened. DREAMING OF SNOW set the pace in the two path, was cued midway around the turn, dug in inside of foes in upper stretch, but yielded
around the sixteenth. NOSTALGIC trailed in the six path, was driven from said position around the turn, and failed to bid from the seven path in the stretch.

Footnotes
CRUZIN MAN broke sharply to set the pace in the two path, was roused while just off the rail passing the quarter, dug in from the two path into the stretch,
but drifted and bumped an outer foe outward thru the final furlong, and just held on. WHENIGETTOHEAVEN chased in the two path, was ridden into the
turn, tipped out to the three path to bid at the top of the stretch, ran on, but was bumped and herded outwards through the final furlong by an inner foe to
end up with place. FAMOUS GENT stalked in the four path, was cued midway around the turn, swung out to the six path turning into the stretch, and kept
on to be up for show. IMMORTALIZATION laid off the pace in the three path, tipped to the rail going into the turn, was coaxed along the inside turning into
the lane, and chased on. AMERICAN SPEED rated in the three path. was roused from the two path into the turn, tipped out to the four path turning into the
stretch, but was one paced. MIDNIGHT RAMBLIN trailed in the five path, fanned out to the seven path turning into the lane, but did not threaten. RICHY
prompted the pace in the three path, floated out to the five path turning into the stretch, and weakened. AFTER AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF
WHENIGETTOHEAVEN AGAINST THE RIDER OF CRUZIN MAN AS WELL AS A STEWARDS INQUIRY, CRUZIN MAN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR BUMPING AND DRIFTING OUT INTO THE PATH OF WHENIGETTOHEAVEN THRU THE FINAL FURLONG
IMPEDING HIM OF A FAIR CHANCE TO GET BY.

FULL COUNT FELICIA settled off the pace along the rail, steadied midway around the first turn, edged closer inside around the far turn, came through
inside of the pacesetter in midstretch, took over near the sixteenth pole and held firm under left-handed urging. ACCOMPLISHED GIRL raced in range
inside, angled four wide near the quarter pole and finished willingly. SISTER LOU ANN set the pace in the two path, was collared by the winner near the
sixteenth pole and held well enough to preserve the show. WALKATHON raced off the pace two wide, swung six wide near the quarter pole and had a mild
rally outside. FAST AS FLIGHT prompted the pace in the three path and weakened through the final furlong. MESSIDOR (IRE) trailed inside, angled out
near the quarter pole and ran on outside. TEQUILERA raced in range two and three wide and lacked a closing bid. POCA MUCHA steadied midway around

eighth pole, and made no impact. SKYRO raced in midfield in the five path, fanned out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but was no factor. PUBLIC

slightly in the two path around the far turn, was cued at the top of the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. VOLCANIC pressed the pace in the four path,
was cued into the far turn, floated out to the five path turning into the lane, and gaveway. BEUYS (IRE) bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the
three path, was driven from the six path into the stretch, but was in tight around the eighth pole, and faded. TIBERIUS MERCURIUS hopped at the start,
was held up near the back of the pack in the two path early but never menaced.

O'CONNOR (CHI) settled in range two wide, edged closer at the rail around the far turn, cut the corner into the lane, bid in tight quarters at the rail, slowly
gained and was up late. GRAND ASPEN prompted the pace in the three path, took the lead near the five-sixteenths, edged ahead turning for home, battled
outside of the winner through the lane and was narrowly outfinished. NY TRAFFIC set the pace in the two path, was steadied while appearing to try to get
out around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and re-rallied one straightened out. STEAL SUNSHINE raced five wide in midpack around the first turn,
angled in to race in the two path around the far turn, swung back out late on the far turn and finished with some late interest. OCTANE was reluctant to load,
bumped with MILES D soon after the start, stalked the pace in the four path and weakened in the lane. DUBYUHNELL saved ground in range, swung out
near the quarter pole and lacked a closing bid. BLUE DEVIL saved ground and failed to menace. GASOLINE was bumped soon after the start then was in
tight entering the first turn, raced four wide around both turns and never threatened. LURE HIM IN played no factor while racing five and six wide. MILES D
was bumped between foes soon after the start, raced off the pace three and four wide and was never in contention.
