SEND ME ON tracked the leader while waiting inside, slipped through entering the stretch, was bumped past the three sixteenths pole, put to a right handed
crop once near the furlong marker then drew off at will through the final furlong to win as his rider pleased. SERENDIPITOUS made the lead soon after the
start, set the pace into the stretch, drifted out then in bumping the winner past the three sixteenths pole then was no match while clearly second best. DEER
CREEK ROAD never far back, loomed boldly three wide on the second turn then was outfinished. KARAMEL CORN trailed for over a half then passed tiring
rivals three wide. PLATE IT UP failed to menace. JOES A ROCKIN pressed the pace two wide into the far turn then weakened. HEIDI'S SINATRA was no
factor. MA MOO POWER unhurried, offered a mild bid four wide into the far turn then flattened out.

WINDY LU WHO away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the clubhouse turn, gave up the lead before a quarter, shifted two wide, prompted the pace
into the stretch, dug in under mild right handed urging through the final stages and proved best by a narrow margin. MISSION GIRL assumed the lead two
wide before a quarter, set the pace along the inside under pressure from the winner while getting slow fractions into the stretch, dug in gamely and just
missed hanging on. SHE'S CRAFTY stalked the pace while saving ground into the stretch, moved closer approaching the furlong marker, shifted to the
three path late and finished with good courage. HIGH FIRE vied for the lead three wide into the stretch then faded. ABIGAIL LEE trailed, was taken outside
entering the far turn and passed a tiring rival. STAR RULES was taken outside shortly after the start then faltered after a half.

MANNFORD pressed the pace three then two wide past the seven sixteenths pole, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and finished full of run under
confident handling to win as much the best. OHIO PLAYER broke slowly, rushed to contention five wide before a quarter, drew on near even terms for the
lead nearing the quarter pole then was no match for the winner. ROLLIN SO PERFECT unhurried early, found his best stride late two wide. HONOR THE D
failed to menace. ACCURATE was a forward factor five then four wide through the turn, swung wide and lost ground. BABA LOOEY had brief speed.
FOREIGN set the early pace along the inside and was through after a half.

Footnotes
SWELTER chased the pace for six furlongs, took over at the top of the stretch then drew off while full of run under a strong hand ride to win as much the
best. GRAND GIZMO never far back, offered a mild bid in the four path entering the stretch and finished second best. STREET MAX saved ground and
finished with good courage along the rail. KILLER BEE void of early speed, had a mild rally late in the three path. INSACIABLE PRINCE was no factor. MR
LAOBAN was no threat. ESTILO FAVORITO sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was used up.
MINDSHIP Q chased the early pace and was through after six furlongs. THE GOSPEL OF MARK broke alertly, dropped back and was never involved.

Footnotes
EL MARRO vied for the lead five wide down the backstretch, took over near the three furlong marker, dropped inside entering the stretch, shook clear
before the furlong marker and prevailed under confident handling MISTER MOBIL allowed to settle, advanced steadily in the four path and finished clear for
second in a determined effort. MUCHO PRIMO battled for the lead two wide into the turn, dropped back a bit then outfinished others while three wide.
ATTACK ANGLE never far back, improved position through deep stretch four wide. SPIN DOCTOR trailed early and passed tiring rivals five wide through
deep stretch. THE MAN CAN dueled for the early lead three then two wide and weakened late. BISCUITS AND GRITS contested the pace along the inside
into the turn, checked when in tight nearing the quarter pole and lost momentum. JACK BE FAST gained a brief early lead, matched strides into the turn four
wide and gave way. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

KERANOS unhurried early, closed with a rush four wide through deep stretch and got up in the final strides. AWESOME ENOUGH stalked the early pace,
rallied four wide through the tur to gain a narrow lead at the top of the stretch, matched strides two wide to the wire and gamely gained second. ON HIS
TOES dueled for the lead three then two wide and was outfinished in a game effort. CONSIDER ME contested the lead two wide then along the inside until
deep stretch then weakened. SILVER MATT never far back, advanced in the five path into the stretch then leveled off. SEEING RED well placed, failed to
respond. PAPA CHARLES broke awkwardly, trailed early, moved up along the rail into the stretch then lacked room at the furlong marker and lost
momentum. ARMOR PIERCING was no factor. ESTILO CLASICO battled for the lead lead along the inside and was through after a half. GOTIGER
SPECIAL was through early.

Footnotes
ENCHANTED MELODY never far back, closed willingly outside rivals in the eight path through the stretch and got up in the final strides.
CONSTITUTIONALIST rushed up two wide to gain a narrow lead before a quarter, set a pressured pace through the turn, edged clear in upper stretch,
drifted out to the seven path under right handed urging and just missed hanging on. FLASH OF CHEROKEE stalked the pace in the four path through the
turn, moved closer outside the leader in upper stretch, shifted inside that one to the five path late and finished with good courage. KEENE ON JENNY trailed
through the turn then passed tiring rivals three wide. ITALIAN TWIN failed to menace. BEAUTY IN MOTION stalked the pace three wide into the stretch
then weakened. DIAL FOR LOVE was hustled along, pressed the pace along the inside into the stretch then gave way. SURPRISED GEM had brief speed.

HENRY MAC with the second flight three wide, rallied five wide through the far turn to make the lead at the top of the stretch and drew off under mild left
handed urging. OAKS HONEY brushed at the start, was allowed to settle, loomed boldly along the rail into the stretch and finished clear for second. RAVEN
MOON brushed at the start, was always within striking distance, split horses three wide past the quarter pole then was outfinished. NEED TO KNOW BASIS
failed to menace. VISUAL MISSION was no factor. SERVE REVENGE COLD sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace for six furlongs
then was used up. MR LOOOCH chased the pace into the far turn, loomed boldly then three wide nearing the top of the stretch then came up empty.

Footnotes
AZTEC stalked the pace into the stretch, rallied three wide to make the lead neat the furlong marker and edged clear late under brisk handling. AQUITANIA
ARRIVAL well placed, loomed boldly along the rail in upper stretch then couldn't handle the winner. GOING IN STYLE sprinted to the lead soon after the
start, set the pace off the rail into the stretch and faded late. AGNELLO'S DREAM pressed the pace two wide while hung out in the five path and weakened
in the stretch. ORO DE MORO MORO unhurried early, swung wide and passed tiring rivals in the seven path. BEACH HOLIDAY settled inside and lacked
the needed response. NEPOTISM failed to menace. CREDIT RIVER closed up along the inside into the stretch wilted late.
