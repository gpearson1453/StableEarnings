PREDICTED set a pressured pace on the inside, headed and fell off the pace nearing the quarter pole, angled out for aim leaving the turn, then slowly
gained in the lane and surged late to get up to prove best under a drive. CHIEF ENGINEER pressed the winner early and made a bid two wide to draw clear
by the quarter pole, remained clear by the furlong marker but was caught late to just miss. NORTHWOODS was well placed two wide, came four wide into
the lane and had a mild late rally to gain the show award. LOCO chased the pace three wide, came five wide into the lane and had no late kick. ON THE
RIM was off a step slow, chased the pace on the inside and weakened. ABBY'S SPIRIT was taken back and dropped to the inside and had no rally.
