Footnotes
SPRITE'S LADY was bumped at the start, stalked three wide, tracked the leaders on the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, dueled with

edged away from KIRTAN, then dug in gamely inside of the winner and battled determinedly to the end. GABBY'SGOLDENVOICE was bumped after the
start, raced off the pace inside, moved up on the far turn and rallied mildly for third. BARN QUEEN was bumped at the start, tracked on the inside, chased
on the far turn and lacked a rally. KIRTAN stalked close up outside, then pressed the pace, bid on the far turn, dueled and weakened in the lane.
SHETALKSTOMUCH was bumped at the start and steadied, raced off the pace and did not factor. SPECIAL LOVE was bumped after the start, raced three
wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. WRITTENBYTHESTARS was fractious in the gate, bumped at the start, stalked two wide and
faded. PAMALWAYSGETSEVEN was bumped at the start, outrun and dropped far back.

Footnotes
FLEETERTHAN, just off the rail, eased out on the turn and won going away under mild handling. YOUR PAL set the pace in the four path then couldn't keep
pace. SMARTY PI challenged outside on the turn then flattened out. VALERIE FIRST broke slowly, raced off the rail, drifted wider under left handed
pressure through the stretch. RIVER SONATA, between foes, was never a serious threat. OUR FLIRTATION failed to be a serious threat. HANDLE WITH
CARE saved ground chasing then tired. SPECTACULAR NOW, well off the rail, failed to menace.

EARLY ENTRY, between foes, took the lead near stretch, drifted out and edged away. PEGASUS RED, just off the rail, split rivals on the turn then moved
out and had a slow gain. BOBCAT moved up three wide, challenged on the turn then weakened slightly. COBH split rivals on the turn and was too late.
SMART RAGS, four wide and just off the pace, faded. A J'S WAY failed to menace. TRULY A MOON SHOT raced wide and tired. INCENSED had his head
turned to the left at the start then lunged leaving the gate. SARATOGA WILDCAT split rivals on the turn, moved to the rail and failed to menace. HUYA
saved ground just off the pace, eased back after a quarter then continued to fall back. THE POOCH, three wide, lost action near stretch and dropped back
quickly then was being eased.

inside, moved up between rivals on the turn, split horses and closed mildly on the rail. GEEBERT raced three or four wide off the pace, came three wide into
the lane, rallied mildly and was outkicked for the minor placings. ARRECIFE raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. STRAWBERRY RED chased
close up outside a rival and tired. STAY HYDRATED chased inside and tired. CHRISATUDE raced three wide off the pace and did not factor. VALENTINE

SQUAN'S KINGDOM stalked two wide then took the lead after half, opened a long lead and then won under strong handling. ATINA SALSA lunged and
broke slowly, raced in four path, waited for room near stretch, drifted out through stretch and was gaining. CARAMEL CREAM was always well placed
between foes and was gaining late. SLINGIN SAMMY B set pace just off rail then tired. TOMARIE, outside early, moved in on the final turn, moved out
again through stretch. MIA BELLA ROSSA raced wide and dropped back. I'M NOT JOKING was finished before a half. PECAN PATTIE showed nothing.
TOWSON was always far back.

Footnotes
DEEP SEA made his way to the rail, took up on the far turn, split foes near stretch then went back inside and won going away. STRONG BREEZE set the
pace just off the rail, resisted but was no match. KLAATU raced outside, eased out wider through stretch and gained show. POWERFUL VENEZUELA was
two wide, steadied in tight on the far turn, challenged again but then weakened. DRUMMER DON failed to be a serious threat. STAYNSIDETHECIRCLE
was wide then wider through stretch. BOB'S MY UNCLE raced wide and failed to menace. ZITMAN steadied after the start. ASPHALT PAVING stalked two
wide then stopped. KING KOA saved ground, stopped suddenly and was eased.
