Footnotes
SPINSTER ROAD stalked the frontrunner on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid while saving ground approaching the five sixteenths pole, swung out
in upper stretch to duel briefly on the outside before taking over with a furlong to go and drawing off to win handily. LINE OF DENHAMS trailed the field
through the early going, saved ground around the turn and gained ground on the outside late. DAZZLING DIABLO led the field from the two path up the
backstretch and around the turn, dueled from the inside in upper stretch and folded in the final furlong. LONESOME DREAM raced off the pace early, saved
ground around the turn and gained ground mildly while drifting out in the stretch, never threatening the top finishers. SEMI CHARMED DAY raced at the
back of the pack through the opening half of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. MAJOR BIZKIT chased
the leader between horses up the backstretch, launched a mild bid from the two path approaching the three eighths pole and tired in the final furlong.
GREENSPAN settled behind the leaders between horses for the run up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and
continued to fade in the stretch. IDAHO TORNADO chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and tired
entering the stretch.

Footnotes
TALIS PARK GRAD came inward in the opening strides, tucked in behind the leading flight, tracked in the two to three path on the turn, came two wide into
the lane, bid on the leader, took the lead past the furlong mark and edged clear in the final sixteenth. BERACUDA HEART set the pace inside while taking
pressure early, cleared in the two path on the turn, carried the lead into the lane, dug in when confronted by TALIS PARK GRAD, was headed past the
furlong mark, and grudgingly allowed the winner to edge clear late. BEE HAPPY ATTACK broke outward, tracked behind the leading flight outside of TALIS
PARK GRAD, saved ground behind that foe around the turn, went to a drive inside in upper stretch, proved no match for that pair but kept on willingly to
prove best of the rest. ROCKET RIDE broke a step slow, trailed while slow into stride, saved ground toward the rear on the turn, angled out four wide into
upper stretch, and rallied with good belated interest under a drive. BILLY NOT WILLIAM was bumped by BEE HAPPY ATTACK in the opening strides,
tracked the early pace outside of the leading pair, chased outside of BEE HAPPY ATTACK on the turn, proved no match for the leading trio into the lane,
and flattened out. POCHO'S DREAM settled well behind the main group early, raced in the three path on the turn, came into the lane inside of TO THE
BANK, and lacked the necessary kick inside. TO THE BANK settled toward the rear, raced in the three to four path on the turn, came two wide toward the
rear into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. DISTINCT THUNDER pressed the pace outside of BERACUDA HEART on the backstretch, tracked three
wide on the turn, turned for home three wide and weakened. BE YOUR OWN HERO tracked at the rear of the leading group early, weakened in the four to
five path on the turn, came three wide into the lane, and was no further factor. NO PASSING ZONE broke a step slow, settled toward the rear, trailed
through the turn, floated out five wide into upper stretch, and mustered no rally.

Footnotes
LAPIS STORM broke sharply, dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, got her neck in front while racing around the turn in the two path and
continued to duel the length of the stretch, in tight quarters with MORA VALLEY, to gamely prevail at the wire. MORA VALLEY was reluctant to load and
stumbled leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, refused to yield down the lane
while racing in close contact with LAPIS STORM late, and was the best of the rest. SUPERSTAR DIVA raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early,
began a bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole and made a mild gain of ground in the stretch while no match for the top two. R U FORREAL
dropped back to trail the field up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and passed tiring horses from there. NIGHTSTAR settled in the
middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in the final furlong. RACHELGOTSTEPHEN raced off the
pace on the outside early, continued around the turn in the three path and made up some ground in late stretch while never threatening. IMA LITTLE
KITTEN bobbled leaving the gate, raced on the inside at the back of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path
and faded from there. HYPNOTISING chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, launched a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole

Footnotes
SAND MOUNTAIN was hustled to the lead, set the pace while saving ground on the turn, kept on under urging in the lane, and just held under a drive.
IRISH TUFF broke slightly inward, was bumped by CHARLO in the opening strides, chased the leading trio inside, saved ground behind the leading pair on
the turn, went to a drive two wide in upper stretch, continued to give chase to the leader, found his best in the final sixteenth, drifted out slightly, nonetheless
rallied and narrowly missed. HE'S WILD settled at the rear of the main group, raced in the three to four path on the turn, was taken five wide in upper
stretch, responded well under a drive, and rallied with good interest to prove clearly best of the rest. TIZRIK broke sharp but soon settled back to midpack,
chased in the two path on the turn, was taken four wide into upper stretch, and rallied mildly under a drive. ABOVE NIKE broke sharply, tracked the early
pace, tracked the leading trio in the four path on the turn, was taken four wide into upper stretch, chased while no match for the top two, and flattened out
late. CACHACO was bumped by MACHO CLASSIC in the opening strides and bumped into ZACROSS as a result, chased toward the rear of midpack, was
urged in the four to five path on the turn and responded with a bid, came three wide into upper stretch, and kept on under a drive until flattening in the final
furlong. CHARLO broke in and bumped IRISH TUFF in the opening strides, settled in second last, raced in the three path with the rear flight on the turn,
angled out in upper stretch, and passed tiring horses seven wide. MACHO CLASSIC broke in and bumped CACHACO in the opening strides, chased two
wide down the backstretch, continued midpack in the two path on the turn, went to a drive inside in upper stretch, and flattened out. ZACROSS was bumped
in the opening strides by CACHACO after that one was bumped by another foe, settled at the rear, was driven in the five path with the rear flight on the turn,
floated to the eight path in upper stretch, and had no response under continued urging. DOLLY'S LINE was sent to track outside of SAND MOUNTAIN early,
tracked in the three path on the turn, emptied out from the five sixteenths, and faded between horses.

Footnotes
SEATTLE TRAIN hit the gate leaving it, settled in to race in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid
approaching the three eighths pole, swung out entering the stretch to find room, continued to gain ground on the outside and prevailed in the final strides.
DEVIL'S ROSE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, began to move up while saving ground around the turn, dueled between
horses down the lane and finished well. TINDERELLA dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering the
stretch, was collared with a furlong to go and gave way late. PROMISES KEPT hopped up leaving the gate and was away slowly, trailed the field on the
outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn, improved position on the inside in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong.
TROPHY BRIDLE hopped up leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside in the opening stages, came around the turn in the three path, offered a
mild bid entering the stretch and was no match. AMERICAN HOLIDAY stalked the frontrunners on the outside early, began a bid between horses around
the turn, entered the stretch in the two path and flattened from there. DON'T HOLD QUEENS trailed the field through the opening half mile, raced in the
three path around the turn, and passed tiring horses in the stretch, never threatening. ANNIE TIME GIRL dueled between horses up the backstretch,
continued to vie for the lead while racing in the two path around the turn, and folded entering the stretch. WILDWOOD SCAT raced in the middle of the pack
between horses early, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. CONSTANCIA chased the leaders up the backstretch, began to drop back while
racing in the two path around the turn and continued to fade in the stretch. MIZ CLIPPER dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch and into the
turn, raced in the two path around the turn and tired entering the stretch. ICE ATTACK raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, trailed
the field from the two path around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
AVASARALA was sent for pace, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, and drew off down the lane while kept to the task. MAUREENLOVESFRANK
stalked the leader down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, proved no match for the leader into the lane but kept on with interest to prove
second best. PERFECT DIVA tracked the leading pair inside of MORRIE'S JOY, continued well behind the leading pair in the three path on the turn, went to
a drive inside in the lane, and chased on best of the rest. MANHATTAN LEGACY settled toward the rear of the main group outside of SILVER CLOUD,
chased in the five path on the turn, swung eight wide into the lane under a drive, and rallied outside foes. AMERICAN EMPRESS chased midpack inside of
SHEZA SAVAGE, was urged to improve in the two path on the turn, swung four wide in upper stretch, and was outfinished despite being hard driven.
MORRIE'S JOY tracked the leading pair between horses early, continued to chase well behind the leading pair outside of PERFECT DIVA while racing in
the five path on the turn, proved no match for the leading pair into the lane and weakened five wide. SILVER CLOUD settled inside toward the rear of the
main group, continued in the two path on the turn, improved position under a drive inside into the lane, but could not sustain his improvement into the final
furlong. RICHNESS tracked the leading pair three wide on the backstretch, lost ground in the five path on the far turn, chased five wide in upper stretch and
flattened out late. ODDSDON'TAFFECTME settled near the rear, raced in the three path on the turn while still well off the pace, was taken seven wide in
upper stretch, went to a drive, but had no response. HEART OF REASON settled near the rear outside of ODDSDON'TAFFECTME, kept on toward the rear
in the four path on the turn, swung out into the lane and offered no rally while racing five to six wide. SHEZA SAVAGE floated out several paths in the
opening strides, chased midpack outside horses, was urged in the six to seven path on the turn, and proved empty in the lane. FULL OF HEART settled at
the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, and offered no bid while driven three to four wide in the lane.

Footnotes
PAULETTE saved ground around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, kicked
clear with a furlong to go and was ridden out to the wire. MELISSANI raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the inside up the
backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path, began a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and chased the winner home from there.
GOLDEN LILY raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, angled in to save
ground around the far turn, began a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole and gained ground steadily on the outside in late stretch. HUNTER'S HELLCAT
trailed the field from the three path around the first turn, raced between horses up the backstretch, began to move up from the two path while racing around
the far turn and continued to improve position from the rail through the stretch. LION LOVE brushed with the horse her outside leaving the gate, raced in the
two path around the first turn, dropped back to trail the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made a mild gain in the stretch while
never threatening. I DON'T WANT TO GO brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead from the two path around the
first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and tired between horses in the final furlong. LOUIE P chased the leaders
from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up to challenge headed into the far turn, entered the stretch in striking position in the
two path and flattened out from there. BE AUTHENTIC raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, navigated the
far turn from the two path and made no bid.

Footnotes
READTHECLIFFNOTES was sent to the lead, continued to set a measured pace down the backstretch despite racing a bit keenly, shook off KHOZAN'S
VALENTINE as he bid approaching the three eighths, continued to save ground around the turn, began to draw off when driven in upper stretch, and
continued to increase his advantage while kept to the task until late. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE was fractious in the gate, bobbled out of the gate and came
inward, tracked the pacesetter two wide through the first turn and three wide from the five eighths, bid two wide on the leader into the far turn, was turned
back approaching the three eighths, went to a drive in upper stretch, could not keep the pacesetter in his sights but found enough to hold the place. YOU'RE
KILLIN ME settled inside midpack through the first turn, advanced to join the tracking flight between horses near the five eighths, was shuffled back into the
far turn, chased in the two path, went to a drive inside in upper stretch, mildly improved position but could not get to KHOZAN'S VALENTINE for the place.
IHADADREAM was pinched back in the opening strides, settled at the inside of the rear flight, was pushed along from the seven sixteenths and rallied in the
four path on the far turn, swung five wide in upper stretch, proved no match for the top three but kept on with interest to prove best of the rest. WAR CHEST
tracked the leading pair in the pocket through the clubhouse turn, continued at the inside of the tracking flight down the backstretch, was driven behind the
leading pair in the three path on the far turn, and flattened out four wide in the lane. BIG MAN BOB chased two wide through the clubhouse turn, kept on
behind the tracking flight down the backstretch, raced three wide into the far turn, was urged in the four path around that bend, but came up empty for the
drive. MEMORY BANK settled outside of IHADADREAM in the rear flight through the first turn, continued in the rear flight down the backstretch, trailed in
the two to three path on the far turn, was taken four wide in upper stretch and had no rally. AMENDED settled toward the rear, hugged the rail while still
toward the rear on the far turn, and had no response in the two path in the lane.

Footnotes
NYOMAN pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid approaching the three eighths pole, took
command with a furlong to go and continued his drive to the wire. GALAHAD KID settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn, was held in place on the rail entering the stretch and improved position through the stretch, chasing the winner home. YOUNG
CORBETT raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, navigated the turn from the two path, launched a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained
ground on the inside in late stretch. HELLOFAGUY raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two and
three path and passed tiring horses on the outside in the stretch. OFFLEE FUN raced between horses in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter
of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and made a mild improvement between horses in late stretch. PERFECT PIRATE led the field between
horses in the opening stages, relinquished the lead while saving ground headed into the far turn, began to drop back midway around the turn and was
outkicked from there. DRAMA STAR angled in sharply leaving the gate, chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around
the turn and weakened in the stretch. RIPE ATTACK was tossing his head when the gates opened and missed the break, was hustled by his rider to press
the pace on the inside, took over the lead from the rail around the turn, dueled in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. MUTAKDDIM ROAD
stumbled and then bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three
and four path and made no bid. ROLL CALL bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and came up empty in the stretch. HIGH HERO veered in and was pinched back leaving the gate, trailed the field up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and was never involved. LITTLE BALTAR raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early
going, made a mild bid from the three path around the turn and flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
STOLEN GLANCE sent to the lead, set a pressured pace while saving ground, vied inside of COOKIN ROSES from the three eighths, kicked clear into
upper stretch, and drew off while kept to the task. QUIET DRAMA tracked the leading pair two wide down the backstretch and into the turn, bid three wide
past the five sixteenths, proved no match for STOLEN GLANCE into the lane, but kept on with interest and outfinished APRIL'S GEM for the place in the
final sixteenths. APRIL'S GEM tracked the leading pair inside of QUIET DRAMA, continued just behind the leading pair in the two path on the turn, went to a
drive inside in upper stretch behind the leader, could not keep pace with the winner, and was outfinished for place in the final sixteenth. LOCASH settled
toward the rear, was pushed along and took closer order while saving ground through the turn, angled out in upper stretch, and offered a mild outside rally.
DRIVE LINE missed the break, left the gate when urged to go, was pushed along to midpack, saved ground through the turn, shifted four wide into upper
stretch, chased on while proving no match for the leading trio, and flattened late. BEZEL SET settled toward the rear, continued patiently in the two path on
the turn, saved ground into the lane and rallied mildly inside of foes. POLLY WAR CRY chased between horses early, was difficult to settle into the turn,
raced in the four path around the bend, drifted out in the lane and lacked the needed kick. COOKIN ROSES pressed the early pace outside of STOLEN
GLANCE, engaged outside the leader, dueled two wide from the three eighths, folded between horses approaching the quarter pole and faded. MAJESTIC
RAJ settled outside of SILVER N LACE in the rear pair, was driven two wide on the turn, and passed between tiring horses in the lane. SILVER N LACE
settled at the inside of the rear pair, saved ground through the turn, and passed tiring horses while urged in the three path in upper stretch.
EMMASTWINKLINGSTAR chased inside early, raced midpack in the two path on the turn, floated into the lane in the six path and faded. SUNDAY ATTACK
chased six wide early, weakened in the three path on the turn and was no factor in the lane.
