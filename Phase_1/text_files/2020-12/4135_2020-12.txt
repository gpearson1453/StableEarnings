three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. GLANCE was reluctant to load, bumped with a foe at the start, was taken up between horses early, went four wide
on the first turn, settled near the back, saved ground on the far turn and also lacked the needed response. OUR SLICK CHICK saved ground on the first
turn, was well placed just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and came up empty.

the two path, set the pace through solid fractions, vied inside on the far turn, lost the lead to the winner in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong
and proved no match while able to get the place. BONITA SPRINGS was taken back between horses nearing the first turn, went two to three wide on that

Footnotes
RIGHTANDJUST went to the front, set the pace on the inside, extended the advantage into upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. CODY'S
LEGACY went five wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the far turn, was driven into upper stretch, drifted in
inside the furlong marker and safely secured the place. POIRIER was fractious in the gate, established a good position just off the pace while inside to the
two path, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, chased into upper stretch and weakened but was well clear for the show. FIELDSTONE went three wide
on the first turn, settled just off the pace, dropped back midway down the backstretch, was urged three then four wide on the far turn, drifted inward in upper
stretch and lacked the needed response. LOVING LUCKY broke in and was off a bit slow, raced inside to the two path on the turns and failed to respond.
SMOKEY HARBOR was hustled from the start, went four wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was urged along three wide on the far
turn and faded. OLYMPIC CHAMPION went three to four wide on the turns and was no factor. HARRISON'S ROSE hit the gate and was off slow, spotted
the front a few lengths, went three wide on the first turn, lagged at the rear, saved ground on the far turn and was no factor. DIRECTIONAL stumbled after
the start and unseated the rider. Following a stewards' inquiry into the start, no change was made to the order of finish.

STUCK IN VEGAS went around the first turn in the two path, settled nicely off the pace, moved closer in the two path on the far turn, rallied five wide into the
stretch, closed fast to get the lead at the three-sixteenths, shook clear into the final furlong and held under strong urging. GREELEY WENT WEST was well
placed on the inside, shifted to the two path into upper stretch, moved out under a drive outside the eighth-pole, rallied in the final furlong and closed
determinedly to just miss while narrowly able to get the place. WHATDATPAY RAY was taken up at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the
rear, raced inside early on the far turn then moved to the two path, came three wide into the stretch, rallied into the final furlong and closed strongly to just
miss in a three-way photo. MAKE ME SMILE went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace, made a bid midway down the backstretch, brushed with a
foe near the three-eighths, vied in the two path while outside of an opponent on the far turn, led into the stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final
furlong and was outfinished. MR. FOUR SEVENS went four wide on the first turn, was rated on the inside of a rival, chased three wide on the far turn, made
an outside bid in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and was out-kicked. PAYDAY TOO went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the
rear, saved ground on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch then shifted further out, advanced into a reasonable striking position into the final
furlong,, drifted out shortly thereafter and flattened out some late while finishing willingly. IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT went four wide on the first turn, settled on
the outside, was ridden along while three wide on the far turn then driven four wide into the stretch, moved out around the three-sixteenths and lacked the
needed response. TREVILION went around the first turn in the two path, set the clear pace, was challenged midway down the backstretch, shied out a bit
and brushed with a foe into the far turn, vied inside on that bend, lost the lead before the quarter-pole, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way. IM A
COWBOY TOO went five wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside, dropped back four wide on the far turn, floated six wide into the stretch
and faltered.

the action while inside on the far turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, drew off under a drive into the final sixteenth, raced under a moderate

footing at the start and was off a bit slow, went four to five wide on the turns, came out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the
rest. EMPRESS CATHERINE bobbled at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged three to four wide on the far turn then

Footnotes
SUN PATH became fractious in the gate when her neighbor did the same then broke through the front of the gate but remained in the stall, came away in
good order, rounded the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid passing the half-mile pole, took the lead in the three path
midway through the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch, drew off under a mild hand ride into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead from that
point to the sixteenth-pole then swapped back to the proper lead and widened while eased up. ROCK STAR PARKING broke out at the start then was
corrected by the rider, accelerated to the lead then moved clear, dropped to the rail early on the first turn, set the pace, was headed while inside on the far
turn, dropped back in upper stretch and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place. MONTPELIER was fractious in the gate then last to
commence, raced inside early on the first turn then shifted three wide, settled off the pace, was urged along while four wide early on the far turn then
dropped to the two path and came up empty. IZEONPOINT went three then four wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was roused while five then four
wide on the far turn and failed to respond.

the three path on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, battled with the runner-up into the final sixteenth
and prevailed under strong urging. FATE FACTOR bumped with a rival at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace inside of a
foe, inched closer in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, battled inside of the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished
while just able to get the place. MORE GOOD TIMES bumped with a foe at the start, moved in early, saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear,
was urged along while three wide for most of the far turn then moved to four wide, swung six wide into the stretch, was carried out near the furlong marker
and finished with good energy to just miss the place. BROADWAY LADY went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging
while inside to the two path on the far turn, pursued the vanguard into the final furlong and finished willingly to just miss the show. VERUCA moved in early,
settled on the inside, moved off the rail outside the quarter-pole then came three wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive around the furlong marker
and also finished willingly but missed the superfecta. AUDREY'S TIME went three wide on the first turn, settled near the back, was urged along while inside
on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and improved position. GO FOR MO tugged hard at the bit under stout restraint early, moved out in the
process, went five wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, went three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved out
around the three-sixteenths and gained late but failed to menace. DADDYMADEMEDOIT went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, raced
three wide early on the far turn then shifted five wide and lacked the needed response. TIPSY GAL tugged hard at the bit while going to the front under tight
restraint then moved clear, set the pace on the inside under a snug hold, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave
way. PETER'S KITTEN was taken in hand off heels nearing the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, settled off the pace, went two then three wide
on the far turn and failed to rally. LEMON CHILL was off slow, saved ground on the first turn, lagged at the rear, went two to three wide on the far turn and
was no factor. ZERO TO SIXTY bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked while three
then four wide on the far turn and failed to respond.
