LEADING PROSPECT was allowed to settle early, raced six wide, was gaining late, took control late and edged clear. YANO'S WAY was outrun early,
waited behind horse, angled out seven wide through the turn, was closing late and finished second best. CASABLANCA HOT tracked the early pace, went
six wide and was empty late. STELLARSBLUERIBBON was unhurried early, circled eight wide and passed tired rivals. BASHFUL BOB was void of any
early speed, raced along the inside and never fired. DIXIELAND DELIGHT was up close early, raced five wide and faded. DECK HUMOR pressed the early
pace, went four wide and weakened. TUCKER D set a pressured early pace from the inside and tired. BULLY RIDE was not far back early from between
rivals, drifted in and gave way.
