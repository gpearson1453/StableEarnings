entering the turn, readily advanced to challenge for command racing into upper stretch and edged clear late under firm right handed encouragement.
MULBERRY, urged inside foes dictating the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, went clear between calls entering the turn, shifted off the
inside dueling for command into upper stretch and proved best of the others while failing to contain the winner. SHALL RETURN tracked off the first flight
along the inside racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued evenly in the closing stages while gaining a share. BUSTIN HEARTS
tracked just off the leaders between foes racing to the turn, then faded nearing upper stretch. MARVELLA was settled in hand racing in the four path early,

DISCREET HEAT, urged to the lead inside foes, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, turned back a challenge nearing upper
stretch, then continued gamely between rivals to maintain the lead under pressure. NICOLE MUNNINGS, in touch with the pacesetter in the opening stages
prompting that rival into the first turn, eased off that foe to track the leader between foes to the second bend, shifted out three deep nearing the lane
advancing to challenge, was fanned four wide leaving midstretch and couldn't quite match the winner while prevailing narrowly for second. PURCHASING
POWER was rated inside foes tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, advanced along the rail to challenge inside the leaders when presented an
opening in upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. PAINTER'S PRIDE settled off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, saved
ground on the far turn, angled out four wide leaving midstretch and continued with an effort to improve position. WILLIAM CROTTY, brushed at the start,
was rated just off the leaders racing to the first turn while a bit rank under restraint, shifted out three deep after a half advancing on the pacesetter to
challenge racing into the far turn but flattened out leaving midstretch. CHARLIES A CHARMER broke inwards brushing a rival, was collected to track off the
second flight while shifting out avoiding some traffic on the first turn, continued three deep to the second bend but failed to menace while being carried out
late. BAD STUDENT raced four wide to the backstretch dropping of the second flight, continued four wide through the far turn and had no rally. ONE STOP
SHOP raced three wide between foes to the first turn, settled out of close quarters to race in the last flight while shifting nearer to the inside nearing the
backstretch but dropped out early.

Footnotes
BABY I'M PERFECT broke sharply to gain a clear advantage, dictated the pace racing a bit off the rail under light rating to the backstretch, was prompted to
maintain that advantage though the far turn and held sway along the inside through the stretch under firm encouragement. BOW AND ARROW, urged to a
forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady bid to challenge the leader nearing upper
stretch but was always only second best. IT'S MANDATORY tracked off the second flight outside a rival under rating racing to the backstretch, angled out
five wide racing through the stretch and edged a rival for a share while no threat to the top pair. OLYMPIC ROMP, pulling against restraint inside rivals
racing to the first turn, tracked off the second flight along the inside to the second bend, angled out three wide entering the lane and continued evenly late.
THE CURT FOX (GB), bumped at the start, was settled in hand while dropping out last racing to the backstretch and never gained contention.
EXCHEQUER broke outwards bumping THE CURT FOX (GB), was righted quickly while angling to the inside to stalk just off the pacesetter inside a rival to
the backstretch, was prompted to advance along the inside on the far turn but faded in the drive.

MARLBOROUGH ROAD (IRE), caught four wide in the opening stages tracking outside foes in second flight, worked her way to the inside nearing the
backstretch to track just off the second flight, shifted outside foes racing into the far turn advancing on the leaders, moved to challenge for command three
deep between foes entering upper stretch and held RAVIR safe to the end under firm handling. The latter broke readily to gain a forward placing between
foes racing to the first turn, was rated dropping off the second flight entering the backstretch, was prompted to regain contention racing four wide into the far
turn, moved to challenge in that path leaving midstretch but proved only second best. FEDERALIST PAPERS angled to the inside early dropping off the
leaders under rating, gained some position along the inside after a half, continued under patient handling while shifting outside rivals racing three deep past
midstretch and edged a rival for a share late. ACTUALLY tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight in early stages, switched out after a half advancing
on the pacesetter, bid between foes nearing upper stretch but weakened in the drive. ONE FAST ORB, held up between foes to drop out last racing to the
backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued evenly. GILDED ASSET, bumped at the start, was urged to gain the lead outside a
rival racing into the first turn, set the pace along the inside into the far turn and gave way abruptly in upper stretch. NAKIBEYA, urged to a forward placing
along the inside disputing the pace into the first turn, tracked the pacesetter along the inside through the backstretch and gave way into the far turn. INDY
FRONT broke outwards bumping GILDED ASSET, was righted to track off the first flight three wide racing to the backstretch but dropped out early.

FOG WARNING, urged between foes into the first turn, sped clear along the inside, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin into the far turn, then was
kept to firm encouragement to hold sway to the end. SILVER EDGE, forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter, was urged to challenge nearing the lane but
proved no match. VALIANT VIRTUE tracked off the second flight between foes in early stages, shifted three wide entering the far turn to lodge a brief bid
nearing the lane but finished evenly late. INDIAN BUZZ tracked the leaders inside foes as part of the second flight, saved ground throughout but lacked the
needed late response. THE HUMONGOUS ONE tracked off the second flight three wide between foes racing to the backstretch and continued evenly to
late stages. SWAGSATIONAL, held up in close quarters along the inside racing to the backstretch, failed to menace thereafter. CPL. DIONICIO settled
between foes in the last flight and faded from contention early. DUKE OF MONROE, caught four wide racing into the first turn, dropped out early.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF THE GREEN broke readily to gain a position outside foes in second flight racing to the first turn, shifted inwards gaining position between foes
nearing the far turn, moved to challenge for command on the far turn, then was roused clear into the stretch and held sway on a comfortable advantage
while being kept to the task. LISHEEN was settled well off the leaders while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, saved ground into the far turn gaining
position inside foes, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance and proved best of the others. NAVAL BATTLE was
rated along the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight in the opening half, briefly awaited an opening leaving the midway point of the far
turn, shifted outside the pacesetter to advance between rivals racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. LULLABY LAND angled to the inside
tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch but had no rally. ROSSENARRA angled inwards to track off the
second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted to the four path entering the lane but had no closing bid. ROYAL OASIS drifted out while under
firm restraint racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. PROMISE ME broke readily, drifted a bit under rating while tracking the pacesetter
between foes racing to the first turn, shifted out three wide on the backstretch, advanced on the leader in tandem with the eventual winner racing into the far
turn but bore out nearing the three sixteenths marker and quickly gave out. MONEY AND HONEY sped clear along the inside racing to the first turn, held
sway on a commanding advantage to the far turn and gave out abruptly once headed by the winner. AWESOME GAP broke slowly, tracked outside foes off
the second flight racing to the backstretch and faded early.

Footnotes
INSIGHTFUL broke readily, was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, shifted a bit off the rail racing into the stretch but
maintained a clear advantage under firm handling. FAN FAN, forced out by LIL'S KITTEN at the start, was settled between foes, gathered momentum
splitting rivals just off the inside racing through the turn, shifted out three wide entering upper stretch and proved best of the others. GRIMHILDE, forwardly
placed just outside the pacesetter, pursued that rival into the turn and weakened leaving midstretch. DANCING IN FIRE tracked off the second flight four
wide through the backstretch into the turn and continued evenly in that path to gain some position. WHAT A KNOCKOUT, bumped at the start, was settled
along the inside, switched out nearing the turn and steadily improved position between foes in the closing stages. SECRET SARAH tracked off the second
flight three wide between foes racing into the turn and passed some tiring rivals late. LADY CHITU, urged along the inside pursuing the leaders as part of
the second flight racing into the turn, steadily faded into upper stretch. BABY ANA broke sharply, tracked off the first flight three wide racing to the turn and
gave way into the lane. BLAZING ZENNA settled outside foes early and failed to menace. STEPPIN ON OUT, urged between foes in the second flight,
shifted inside entering the turn and steadily faded. LIL'S KITTEN swerved out at the start impeding a rival, was settled near the inside, suffered an apparent
injury nearing upper stretch, was outdistanced in the stretch, then was vanned off the course after the race.

Footnotes
THE CONNECTOR, prominent along the inside from the outset, was eased off the leaders after the opening furlong to stalk those rivals along the inside
racing into the turn, advanced along the rail nearing upper stretch, came through to challenge when presented an opening entering the lane and edged
forward late under firm encouragement. DERBY CITY was settled off the second flight along the rail, saved ground steadily gaining position inside foes and
prevailed for the place honors nearing the wire. PUDDING broke awkwardly, was urged between foes to dispute the pace, then along the inside racing into
the turn, pressed the issue past midstretch but yielded to the top pair late while finishing on even terms with a rival for a share. BEE BY THE SEA tracked off
the first flight outside rivals, advanced to challenge four wide racing into upper stretch but was outkicked while sharing third. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY,
urged along three wide between foes racing into the turn pursuing the first flight, continued evenly in late stages. RAOFTHESUN tracked off the second
flight between foes just off the inside, angled out five wide entering the lane but had no rally. THE GREAT KATH, unprepared for the start, lost ground to the
field, was fanned six wide racing into the stretch and proved no threat while making some belated progress. BETTING ON RED, urged between foes
pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way midstretch. BETWEENHEREANDCOOL settled between foes racing to the turn and failed to
menace thereafter. SOLITARY JACK, urged along four wide prompting the pace racing to the turn, gave way into the lane. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
