JUST CALL ME KEN was allowed to settle early from the inside, angled out, was gaining and edged clear for the win. ZOMBIE ALAN pressed the early
pace, went four wide into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. CELESTIAL COWBOY set a pressured early pace from the inside and
weakened late. SHIO tracked the early pace, advanced seven wide and was empty. IRISH POLO was reserved early, raced between rivals and finished
belatedly. MEGA SOURCE raced in mid pack early from between rivals and tired. SENDITLIKECHILLY was unhurried early, circled nine wide and never
fired. BIG BAD JON was taken back early, raced eight wide and offered no rally. CONQUEST CROWN ME was void of speed and was no factor. THE
RACED WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
BLANK IT chased the early pace, went six wide, opened up and held. MIDNIGHT DESTINY was outrun early, circled nine wide, was gaining late and
finished second best. SOLID GOLD BAR was up close from between rivals and weakened late. ROMAN PLEASURE raced in mid pack early, went five wide
and tired. MR. SILVER EXPRESS set a pressured early pace angled in and faded. EMBELLISHING BOB was void of any early speed, went four wide and
never fired. NIGHT AT THE OPERA was taken back, raced between rivals and offered no late rally. DIABOLICAL KING was allowed to settle early, raced
along the inside and gave way. LORD CHARLES hopped at the start and never recovered. SWITCH BACK was not far back, raced between rivals and
weakened. MAKING A MARC was reserved early and was no factor.
