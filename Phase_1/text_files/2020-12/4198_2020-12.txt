Footnotes
WHAT'S THE MOVE settled far off of the pace in the two to three path around the first turn, shifted to the four path, then five path, around the far turn before
swinging six wide turning for home, then rallied stoutly through the lane, and just caught the leaders at the wire. SANDRA'S MINE vied inside of STARRY
HOPE around both turns, dug in gamely to sustain the duel through the lane, drifted out passing the sixteenth pole while outgaming her counterpart, but was
nailed on the wire by an outer oncharging rival. STARRY HOPE vied for the lead outside of SANDRA'S MINE while staying a path away from that rival,
forged a very narrow advantage in upper stretch while the battle continued with his inner counterpart, but was outgamed by that foe inside the final sixteenth
before steadying when put to tight quarters by that foe at the wire. LOVE RANGER got caught four wide while off of the pace around the first turn, inched
closer to stalking position while tipping down to the three path into the far turn, shifted back four wide turning for home, but was outkicked by the eventual
winner in midstretch and chased evenly thereafter. TRULY gained ground from far off of the pace into the far turn, took that bend in the four to five path, but
was outkicked by an outer foe in midstretch and leveled off. EIGHTY SEVEN NORTH saved ground at the rear of the field around the first turn, shifted out to
the four to five path around the far turn before swinging seven wide in upper stretch, and rallied willingly. LETSNOTGETOEXCITED rushed after bumping
with an inner foe at the start, lied forwardly placed two wide, stalked from behind the leading duelers around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with them in
upper stretch, and faded. CLADDAGH'S RUN tracked from midpack two wide, but came under a drive approaching the five sixteenths pole, and offered no
response. TWIRLING DERVISH saved ground far off of the pace around the first turn, and never got involved. BIG CHEEKS got caught five to six wide
around the far turn and failed to make an impact. SILENT EMPRESS stalked along the inside, but lost position into and around the far turn before further
weakening turning for home. MYSTICAL CHARGE saved ground from midpack under steady urging, but was done early.

Footnotes
BROOKES ALL MINE pressed the pace two wide, seized command between foes near the three-eighths pole, drew clear in upper stretch and held clear
under a steady drive. VALLEY DATE veered in badly at the start to get away about five lengths in arrears, advanced three wide around the turn, continued
on the left lead and finished willingly while unable to seriously dent the winner's margin. GRACE'S DRAMA raced off the pace two wide, tipped further out in
upper stretch and was along late for the show. SASSY JUSTICE stalked the pace three wide, bid outside of the winner near the three-eighths pole, could
not match strides with that rival in upper stretch and lost third late. GRAN ETIQUETA saved ground off the pace, angled four wide leaving the quarter pole
and lacked a rally. BLOSSOM BOW chased the pace four wide and was through after a half. MARKISTAN played no factor while racing two wide. LIL MISS
HOTSHOT was pinched back at the start, raced three wide and made little impact. NONCENTS set the pace along the rail under pressure from the winner
and retreated after a half.

Footnotes
MAHOMES MONEY dueled for the lead inside of PERSPECTIVE, then inside of a pair of rivals turning for home as DARK TIMBER made a bid, but shook
away from those foes in upper stretch, and held sway under driving pressure. DARK TIMBER stumbled substantially at the start, rallied four wide around the
turn to bid for the lead outside of the dueling leaders at the quarter pole, but was turned away in upper stretch by his innermost counterpart. KING CAIRO
saved ground far off of the pace, and rallied along the rail for a minor share. SOCIAL EQUALITY broke a step slowly, then was jostled and pinched back
between horses after the start, lied far off of the pace in the four to five path around the turn, changed leads approaching the sixteenth pole, and improved
willingly. PERSPECTIVE dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner, but proved no match while weakening in upper stretch. NACO tracked from
midpack in the two path, steadied just a bit into the turn as THE GREAT OZ cut down, shifted four wide approaching the quarter pole to attempt a rally, but
hung on his left lead through the lane and failed to do so. THE GREAT OZ chased three wide, cut down into the turn, but weakened in upper stretch.
MILITARY DRILL chased four to three wide, but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole, stopped, and was eased through the final furlong.

PAYNTDEMBLUESAWAY pressed the pace two wide, seized command near the three-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared and held clear under a drive.
SANITY saved ground in midpack, angled out in upper stretch and rallied for the place. KITTEN'S COVERGIRL saved ground off the pace, swung out
nearing the eighth pole and finished well. SWIRLING CANDY went evenly while racing two wide. DISTINCTLY BLUE threw her head at the start, saved
ground well back and improved position two wide in the lane. OVER GATORS set the pace along the rail while hounded by the winner and tired in the drive.
NIKEE KAN hopped at the start and made little impact while racing two wide. R HAPPY ENDING was fractious and briefly sat down in the gate, had some
speed inside and came up empty in the lane. SOMETHING MAGICAL failed to menace while racing three wide. MIDNIGHT WITCH was outrun two wide.

AMOUNT bumped with an inner foe after a bit of a flat-footed start, recovered to stalk along the inside, shifted out three wide at the five sixteenths pole to
take aim on the leaders, inched closer to bid at the quarter pole, drew off when shown the stick passing the furlong marker, and was ridden out under brisk
hand urging to the wire. RABDAN set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist the winner's bid passing the quarter pole, but proved no match for that foe at
the furlong marker, then held place. EMPEROR'S CAUSE lied forwardly placed three wide, inched closer around the turn to bid for the lead at the five
sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with the leader and an outer rallying foe passing the quarter pole, but kept on to secure a minor reward.
SKYWALKING was bumped by an inner foe at the start, lied far off of the pace in the four path, rallied in the six path turning for home, but brushed with an
inner foe while needing correction from lugging in approaching the furlong pole, then leveled off. SKYRO lied off of the pace in the two path, got outmoved
by outer foes turning for home, then shifted to the six path in midstretch and improved late without threatening. KING FORCE broke out a bit and bumped an
outer foe at the start, was urged along while off of the pace, took the turn in the three to four path before coming into the lane between horses, but was
brushed by his outer rival approaching the furlong pole, and got outfinished for a very minor share. DR. ROGER stumbled at the start, saved ground far off
of the pace before shifting two wide turning for home, but lacked a kick between horses in upper stretch. FAR AWAY LOOK brushed the gate at the start,
raced off of the pace while caught five wide, came under a drive into the turn, but failed to respond and faded. EAMONN pressed two wide early on, but
weakened passing the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
SIR ANTHONY was firmly rated in midpack while racing three to four wide through the first twelve furlongs, advanced two wide between rivals around the
far turn, reached near even terms approaching the eighth pole and edged ahead under left-handed urging. CONVICTION TRADE set a clear pace well off
the rail around the first three turns, angled in to save some ground rounding the far turn, was collared in midstretch, battled on inside of the winner and gave
way grudgingly. COWTOWN saved ground well back, made an advance under urging three deep rounding the far turn and flattened out a bit in the lane.
MURALIST broke a bit awkwardly and bumped CLEAR VISION at the start, saved ground well back through the early stages, made a wide move down the
backstretch, bid four deep around the far turn and weakened a bit in the lane. CLEAR VISION was bumped at the start, raced well back two wide, advanced
five wide around the far turn and was one-paced in the lane. TINTORETTO (GER) was pinched back at the start and never threatened while racing three
wide. FOCUS GROUP played no factor while racing two wide. DANTE'S FIRE saved ground to no avail. TREASURE TROVE stalked the pace two wide
and tired after a mile and a half. HIEROGLYPHICS stalked the pace three wide and retreated nearing the far turn. HIGH NOON RIDER rushed up despite a
strong hold around the second turn, was in range for another half mile then faltered.

Footnotes
GREATEST HONOUR was cost early position by being bumped by an outer foe at the start, lied far off of the pace, got bumped and bothered by DUDES
GOT GAME around the first turn, rallied stoutly five wide around the far turn to bid for the lead in upper stretch, and was driven clear through the final
furlong. DYNAMIC ONE was off a step slow, perched himself four wide and outside of foes while rating off of the pace, advanced down the backstretch
under his own power before assuming command from inner foes with five sixteenths to run, cleared off around the far turn with GREATEST HONOUR in
pursuit, but was headed by that foe inside the final furlong, and proved second best. ANOTHER DUKE stalked along the inside, shifted three wide to
produce a rally, but was outkicked by the eventual winner turning for home, then stayed well clear of others through the lane. BOURBON HIGHWAY lied
forwardly placed three wide, came under a drive into the far turn to vie for the lead passing the seven sixteenths pole, faltered passing the three furlong pole
as his outer foe took over, then kept on to surpass tiring foes through the lane. GODS PROMISE set a pressured pace along the inside, but had little
resistance from DYNAMIC ONE with less than three furlongs to run, and faded. MAXIM MOMENT prompted the pace two wide, but proved no match for an
outer foe while weakening passing the three furlong marker. ROYAL TRYST bumped an inner foe at the start, trailed the field early on, got hindered when
bumped by GREATEST HONOR due to DUDES GOT GAME's incident around the first turn, and failed to factor. BOCA GUY was reluctant to load, tracked
from midpack in the two path early on, but failed to factor. DUDES GOT GAME was off slowly and raced far off of the pace along the inside, but appeared to
take a bad step into the first turn, bore out into GREATEST HONOR and fell approaching the seven furlong pole, then was vanned off.

Footnotes
COLONEL LIAM settled off the early pace while racing three wide, cruised up four deep around the far turn, seized command approaching the lane, quickly
cleared and widened under left-handed urging. DON JUAN KITTEN advanced two wide to the lead around the first turn, angled in early on the backstretch,
set the pace along the rail from there until collared by the winner turning for home and fought on willingly to save second. SUMMER TO REMEMBER led
early, settled back into a stalking position inside, angled out in upper stretch and battled between rivals to gain the show. BY YOUR SIDE tracked the pace
two wide, checked late on the first turn, remained in range three deep around the far turn, angled wider in upper stretch and was outkicked outside of foes
for the minor awards. FANCY LIQUOR was up close four wide around the first turn, remained in range three wide between foes around the far turn and
lacked the needed stretch rally. SOLE VOLANTE saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the quarter pole and went evenly. ANGELUS
WARRIOR saved ground around the turns and played no factor. ME AND MR. C lacked early speed while racing two wide, went four wide around the far
turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and never threatened. FIGHTING SEABEE steadied off heels early, raced three and four wide and made little
impact. DACK JANIEL'S prompted the pace three then two wide and retreated after six furlongs.

Footnotes
WHAT'S TO BLAME tracked from midpack three wide, inched closer to the leading pair around the turn to bid for the lead three wide at the quarter pole,
dueled outside of a game LIFE IN SHAMBLES through the lane, and prevailed vie a head bob at the wire. LIFE IN SHAMBLES prompted the pace setter
two wide, vied between horses turning for home as WHAT'S TO BLAME made a menacing bid, dueled gamely inside of that rival through the lane, but was
out-nodded on the wire. SILVERLY ENOUGH was bumped by an inner foe and got a bit crowded at the start, lied well off of the pace three wide, rallied
mildly in the four path around the turn, then sustained his chasing grind through the lane, but did not have enough to catch the leaders. SEPTEMBERTEN
stalked along the inside, but came under a drive into the turn, failed to keep pace with the dueling leaders turning for home, then shifted off of the rail in
upper stretch, and kept on to reclaim a minor share. FRONT LOADED broke outwards while rank at the start, tracked from midpack two wide and between
horses, faded before swinging five wide in upper stretch, and failed to factor. DOC AMSTER set the pace along the inside while feeling stern pressure from
LIFE IN SHAMBLES into the turn, then was headed by that foe and the eventual winner passing the three sixteenths pole, and weakened in upper stretch.
SIR KAHN lied far off of the pace in the three path around the turn before shifting six wide in upper stretch, but had no rally. SAGAMORE MISCHIEF saved
ground well off of the pace, and was outrun.

Footnotes
VIGILANTES WAY set a pressured pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. MORE THAN UNUSUAL settled off the
pace while racing two wide around the first turn, edged closer three wide rounding the far turn, could not gain on the winner through the lane and just lasted
for the place. SPEAKTOMEOFSUMMER raced off the pace two wide, moved up between rivals around the far turn, steadied near the quarter pole, angled
out in upper stretch, rallied and just missed second. MO OF THE WEST tracked the pace two wide in the clear, bid three deep around the far turn, was
repulsed by the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished for the minor awards. STUNNING SKY angled out entering the first turn, raced three wide
around that bend, four wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly. ASK BAILEY broke slowly, raced well back two wide, went four wide around most of
the far turn, fanned six wide into the lane and improved position. VIRGINIA BEACH chased the pace from the rail and lacked a closing bid. AMERICAN
GIANT saved ground to no avail. WINDRACER (IRE) broke awkwardly and was never involved while racing two wide. BLUE MISTRESS pressed the winner
two wide and stopped nearing the lane.

Footnotes
DONJI tracked from midpack two wide, shifted four wide turning for home before producing a five wide bid outside of rivals passing the furlong pole, and
drew clear. ANOTHER lied far off of the pace two wide, cut down into the far turn squeezing KING OF SPADES, saved ground around that bend, then
rallied along the rail to bid for the lead inside of horses passing the furlong pole, but was outfinished by an outer rival. BATTLE OF BLENHEIM lied forwardly
placed two wide, bid for the lead four wide and between horses passing the furlong pole, but was outkicked. PONT DU GARD tracked from midpack four
wide, then three wide around the far turn, leaned in and bumped an inner counterpart multiple times through midstretch, then stayed on for a minor share.
JOYFUL HEART stalked two wide, inched closer to vie three wide and between horses at the furlong pole, but gave way thereafter. THE MIGHTY JUDGE
lied far off of the pace three to two wide, but received bumps from his outer counterpart through midstretch, then stayed on between horses late.
MACAGONE cleared off and maintained a margin around both turns, but was swallowed up passing the furlong pole. KING OF SPADES saved ground off
of the pace, but was squeezed along the rail by ANOTHER at the three furlong pole, steadied, and failed to menace thereafter. BASHA was shifting his
weight around when the gates opened and was unprepared for the start, trailed the field, took the turn in the five path, and improved. HONEY DONT lied far
off of the pace four wide around the turns and failed to factor. DERBY CHAMPAGNE stalked along the inside, saved ground around both turns, but faded
through the lane. UHTRED lied forwardly placed three wide, but weakened while drifting five wide turning for home.
