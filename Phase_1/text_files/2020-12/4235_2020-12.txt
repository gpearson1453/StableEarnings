Footnotes
PITCHING ARI stalked the early pace inside, awaited room under a firm hold mid turn, eased out and raced four wide at the eighth pole and finished well
late to be clear under strong handling. BOURBON STREET showed good early speed from the outside to set all the pace, was clear into the upper stretch
but couldn't hold off the winner to be second best. DECORATED was allowed to settle early on, moved five wide at the three sixteenths pole and flattened
out in the drive. NO FOOLING DUDE stalked the pace, raced three wide in the lane and had no late response. BOUNCING AROUND broke poorly, raced
towards the inside and never threatened. FERNWOOD DRIVE tracked the leader from the inside and failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
COCONUT CAKE stalked the pace, moved up four wide at the three sixteenths pole and finished well to get up under steady handling. BOBBY'S
GOLDENGIRL pressed the pace, raced three wide in the stretch and kept on to the wire. BABY BOSS showed good early speed and weakened a bit in the
latter stages. QUIET IMAGINATION stalked the pace, raced five at the eighth pole and had no response. ANKLE MONITOR settled off the early pace, raced
six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. LONG POINT BEACH was slow early and never threatened. MONEY FROMHEAVEN dropped back
and failed to respond. NAUGHTY THOUGHTS saved ground and never menaced.

DANCE AND DANCE stalked the early pace, moved up three wide through the stretch and drove clear late under steady handling. PATRIOTIC PUNCH was
allowed to settle early, moved up four wide at the three sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner. SARAH'S TREASURE was unhurried early, moved
four wide at the eighth pole and made a mile late gain. ESCAPE FUND pressed the pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. INDY TAKES CHARGE
stalked the pace, raced four wide in the lane and had no response. DIVIDED SKY (IRE) raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.
WANDERLUST showed good early speed from the inside and gave way. C'EST MARDI raced far back and never was involved.

Footnotes
BELFOUR tracked the leader along the inside, took command through the stretch and was well clear late under steady handling. UNEQUIVOCAL was
allowed to settle early, moved up five wide into the upper stretch but was no match for the winner. KING MAURO dropped back early, moved up seven wide
nearing the eighth pole and showed good late interest. INVEST stalked the pace, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid.
KEEPING THE PEACE stumbled at the break, raced four wide at the eighth pole and never was a serious threat. IN HIM WITH HIM stalked the pace from
the outside and weakened through the stretch while racing deep. SUCCESSFUL ZIP was rated back early, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never
was a factor. BIG HAMBONE set all the pace from the outside and tired readily.
