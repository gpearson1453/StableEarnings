Footnotes
TIMELESS BOUNTY dueled early, shook clear on the turn, widened to win under mild urging to win as much the best. AWESOME OX dueled with the
winner for a half, was no match late but was second best. CALIFORNIA RONE tracked three wide and went evenly late. MAKING ME CRAZY raced mid
pack and was no menace. NAMATH was no threat. BOSS BEAR raced on the inside and did not threaten. SUNNY BEAST raced close up, early and was
through after a half. UNCLEJACKOMO was outrun. ROCHEBLAVE was no factor. GALLIPOLIS broke slowly and trailed. Times omitted for further review
