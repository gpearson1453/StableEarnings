FACTOR THIS IN stalked the pacesetter, advanced midway on the turn, rallied outside, pulled away and was ridden out. TACTICAL PURSUIT (IRE) raced
off the pace inside, moved up inside on the turn, rallied inside and was along for the place spot. KING'S HOUSE opened up early to set the pace, weakened
in the stretch and held for third. EMPEROR JOHN raced off the pace, came five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. AMI'S ARTIE was off slowly, raced
two wide off the pace, came three wide into the lane and gained mildly inside. HERE WEGO chased the pace raced between rivals on the turn and tired.
REGAL QUALITY chased outside, raced three wide on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
FLORENCIA advanced steadily outside, was carried wider and brushed lightly in early stretch, took the lead nearing furlong grounds and won with speed to
spare. TIZ A SHARPIE saved ground early, moved to the outside near stretch, went back to rail in early stretch and gained place. FREE COFFEE, just off
the rail, split rivals near stretch, drifted out soon after brushing winner and then weakened. VALERIE FIRST, racing out from the rail, swung wide into stretch
and passed tiring foes. SUPERGIRL POWER saved ground in second flight, moved off the rail and split foes on the final turn but wasn't a serious threat.
GEORGIA BONNET, off the rail and far back, drifted in through stretch and showed little. SAVANNAH'S DREAM saved ground and was never a threat.
PADRINONEVERQUITS, just off the rail, ran as fast and far as she could then stopped.

Footnotes
SIGHT LINE set the pace in the three path, began to edge away nearing the stretch, opened a long lead with a furlong to run and won under mild handling.
SALSA'S RETURN fell back after alert start, saved ground to the final turn then swung out very wide and gained place. ALGORIX, three wide early, raced
between foes on the final turn and through stretch and coasted home for the show spot. LEGACY'S PRINCE saved ground to the final turn, split foes into
stretch then moved back to the rail and was much too late. KID MAC COOL was outside and raced in closest pursuit of the winner, faded through the drive.
BANKER'S ISLAND, reluctant to load, split rivals when rallying on the backstretch and final turn then gave way. EDEN RIDGE raced wide and showed little.
HIGH FLYING GUY saved ground in second flight then tired. IMMUNITY checked back from between foes leaving first turn, raced wide then drifted out
badly through stretch. MANTLE, off the rail, showed nothing. DIAMOND SQUARE steadied briefly racing into the first turn, swung wide and had brief speed.

Footnotes
GEEBERT was three wide backstretch and turn, rallied to the lead leaving furlong grounds and edged away. ACED broke slowly and raced just off the rail,
took up lacking room on the far turn, was steadied along on the turn, eased out in mid stretch and gained place. SKIPIN ON ORCHARD raced wide while
just off the pace and lacked a strong closing bid. BODEFLEX set the pace inside, resisted when challenged but then weakened late. KINGSVILLE was just
off the rail, steadied when trying to split foes on the far turn, found a small opening between rivals in upper stretch and then finished well. CALL ME DADDY,
in tight on the backstretch, moved outside and failed to menace. IRISH MEADOW, very wide, failed to menace. IMPACTFUL, between rivals, showed little.
GLORY SONG was two wide dueling, steadied on the far turn then fell back. TIVANO, wide, wasn't a serious factor. JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF saved ground
and tired. OUR PHILLY SPECIAL was three wide and just off the pace then stopped.

CASTLE CASANOVA vied three wide for the lead, dueled with DONNIE BRASCO on the far turn, battled heads apart with that rival passing the eighth pole
and inched away late to prevail. DONNIE BRASCO vied between rivals for the early lead, dueled on the far turn, dueled inside of the winner in the stretch
drive and dug in gamely to the end. BOAT OVER THE HILL tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, finished evenly and earned the show spot.
BOBBYFROMTHEPALM raced off the pace between rivals, went three wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. LI'L DUDE L DO IT stalked between rivals,
chased two wide on the far turn and weakened. RAGE AWAY was bumped at the start, raced off the pace, inside on the far turn, came four wide into the
lane and had no rally. GAMBIT was bumped at the stretch, raced five wide early, had three or four wide trip and failed to threaten. HOUSE ARREST vied
inside for the lead, chased inside on the far turn and faded. GILDED WARRIOR raced four wide early, stalked four wide and gave way. JONES TAXI was
outrun.

MR THRIFTY raced outside and rallied around rivals on the final turn, took the lead near furlong marker and edged away late. JEROME AVENUE, three
wide on the first turn, moved to the rail and set pace to near mid stretch but was unable to match strides late. OVER SENSUAL saved ground to the far turn,
eased out and had no late kick. SCREEN SAVER raced two wide in second flight then tired. AWE MUN, outside winner early, never threatened. MANOLITO
prompted the pace two wide then tired. POSTINO'S VOW, racing in the three path, split rivals on the final turn and showed little. RISQUE REBEL saved
ground in second flight then tired. ENDUROS DIAMOND, bearing out and racing greenly, was pulled up after a quarter mile.

Footnotes
WOODBURY raced between foes on the backstretch and final turn, eased out racing into stretch, took the lead leaving the furlong marker and drew away
under mild handling. HE IZ GONE alternated for the lead two wide and gamely held place. GENGHIS alternated for command along the rail and held on
tenaciously. KADENS COURAGE raced wide while just off the pace and faded late. DANCE FOR ORO racing outside winner early, came up empty.
AHSAD was outside and well placed, faded through the stretch. KING'S GOLD, outrun while wide, was very wide into stretch and through stretch. LUXURY
SUITE failed to menace racing outside. FLAT OUT FLASHY, just off the rail and just off the pace, tired. MR CLASSICAL saved ground and tired. CAPE
MAY STYLE showed nothing racing along the rail. KION, very wide, was never a factor.
