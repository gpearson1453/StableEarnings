Footnotes
CASSIE BELLE stalked the lone leader two wide, closed in past the quarter pole, took the lead at the top of the lane, cleared rival under right-handed urging
and held safely under strong handling. NEW HEAT tracked the pace from inside, saved ground to the stretch, finished well along the fence and gained the
place. KLEEN KARMA traveled between foes around the first turn, outside a rival on the backstretch, went between foes again at the three-eighths pole,
tipped three wide into the lane and got edged for second. SCARLET HEAT traveled two wide then moved to the rail around the first turn, angled out into the
lane and weakened. EDDIE'S SISTER away quickly and crossed over to the inside, set the pace to the far turn, challenged leaving that bend, could not go
on with the winner in the drive and weakened. HOT ON THE TRAIL bumped at the start, went four deep around the first turn, traveled three then two wide
around the second bend and lacked further response. CONCISE ADVICE broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, took the first turn outside a pair of
rivals, raced between foes at the half-mile point, angled to the rail around the final turn and never threatened. REIWA went four wide around the first turn,
stalked the pace off the rail, came three wide into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
MASTERING broke out and bumped rival, showed early speed then pressed from outside, raced on even terms with the leader into the far turn, put a head
in front midway around the bend, put away inside rival then met the bid from EXAULTED at the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew away
while drifting out late. EXAULTED bumped at the start, traveled three wide into the first turn, well placed behind the top pair up the backstretch, bid three
wide at the quarter pole, could not sustain challenge in upper stretch but was clearly second best. MONGOLIAN KINGDOM tracked the pace from inside
then angled out on the second turn and finished a clear third. DIRECT LINE went through along the inside to the set the pace with company to the outside,
dueled into the far turn, lost command midway around the turn, started to weakened leaving the bend and tired in the lane. MONGOL ALTAI asked early
from outside, traveled four wide and outside a rival into the first turn, lost ground through the backstretch, entered the stretch two wide, was eased in the
lane and walked off.

Footnotes
LOVE MY JIMMY off alertly and quickly took control set the pace along the inside then two wide leaving the bend, inched away into the stretch, drifted out
mildly through the stretch and held well. CASHLINGS angled outside the leader early, stalked in the two path to the turn, took aim three wide into the stretch
but lacked the needed late kick. BOLU broke in a bit, chased four wide through the turn and bested the rest. SKY NAVIGATOR bumped inside rival at the
start, settled off the rail then angled in nearing the turn, came off the rail a bit leaving the bend and got edged for the show. ALEXANDER'S DREAM bumped
leaving the gate, chased outside a rival, went two then three wide around the turn and weakened. SANTIAGO'S WISH bumped at the start, trailed early,
went two wide around the bend and was never a factor. COASTAL KING tracked well off the inside, went five wide into the turn, angled into the three path
around the bend then came out a bit into the drive and had nothing left.

Footnotes
HONOS MAN bumped by inside rival leaving the gate, settled off the pace between foes, closed in around the second turn, went three wide into the stretch,
rallied to the front past the eighth pole and won going away. RAILSPLITTER broke out and bumped rival at the start, showed speed along the inside, set the
pace up the backstretch, met a bid from outside around the far turn, fought back inside and clung to a short lead with a furlong left, lost command shortly
after and held the place. TURN THE SWITCH stumbled, broke in and bumped at the start, went up outside a rival then outside the leader, applied pressure
around the far turn, dueled leaving the turn and into the stretch, challenged to the eighth pole then flattened late. ARMOUR PLATE bumped by rival at the
start, rated in the two path then moved to the rail and saved ground into the lane and lacked room through the length of the stretch. STREET BEHAVIOR
stalked the pace from inside, tipped out into the stretch and lacked a bid. GO TIME raced between foes early then three wide into the first turn, angled in
around that bend, saved ground into the stretch and proved no menace. PALACE PRINCE traveled four wide around the clubhouse turn, three wide into the
stretch and weakened. MEADWAY was always outrun.

OCTOPUS bumped leaving the gate, dueled outside of PRINCE RICKY for command, cleared that rival nearing the quarter pole, moved to the rail in the
lane and held safely. LEPRINO chased three wide through the turn and gained ground on the winner late. NATURAL HISTORY dropped back early, angled
to the rail and saved ground to the stretch, moved out in the lane and showed late effort to earn the show. LOLO PANIOLO raced off the pace, entered the
turn four wide then angled into the three path and improved position. TURNTHECLOCKTOZERO broke in and bumped the winner, chased off the rail, two
wide around the bend and weakened. PRINCE RICKY dueled for the lead along the inside, could not match strides nearing the quarter pole, shifted in at the
top of the lane and gave way. NONNO'S POLARIS went two wide around the turn and came up empty.

outfinished for the place. MASTER RYAN chased between early, squeezed and checked at the nine-sixteenths, angled to the rail, saved ground to the

Footnotes
THE CHOSEN VRON set the pace with company to the outside, held a short lead in the two path through the bend, cleared rivals in upper stretch and
powered away under a few taps of right-handed encouragement and strong handling late. BIG STORY stumbled at the start, went up outside the top pair,
took the turn four wide and bested the rest. WARRENS CANDY MAN stalked outside a rival, angled out at the quarter pole, exited the bend four wide and
kept on to gain the show. HAIL FREEDOM pressed the pace between rivals to the lane and weakened. HOCKEY DAD in range early, went four wide into
the turn, five wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. ROWDY OH chased along the inside and weakened. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS tracked five wide into
the turn, angled down to the three path around the bend and could not rally. WHISKEY TALK raced off the pace, angled to the rail on the turn and lacked
further response. BIG FRANK DA TANK off slow and spotted the field a few lengths to begin, moved out on the back stretch, advanced three wide on the
turn then went inside a rival into the lane and weakened. SIR WILLIAMS DREAM traveled near the back of the pack, angled out in upper stretch and was
never a factor.

Footnotes
FABOZZI raced mid-pack early, angled out into the stretch, rallied four wide and drove past the runner-up. IMPRESSION chased three wide and outside a
rival on the first turn, entered the second turn four wide, bid outside the trio at the quarter pole, cleared into the lane and got outkicked by the winner in the
final furlong. WILSHIRE DUDE stalked outside a rival, bid three deep around the far turn, could not match the top pair in the lane and stayed on to earn the
show. OCEAN FURY stalked two wide, crept closer leaving the back stretch, bid between and put a head in front at the quarter pole, lost the lead into the
stretch and was outfinished in the final sixteenth for the show. COSA NOSTRA (IRE) tossed head and came away bit slowly, taken back and angled to the
inside, angled into the two path leaving the far turn, moved further out in the lane and grinded out the final furlong. JAN'S RESERVE raced four wide
through both turns and proved no menace. BITTER RING HOME entered the stretch two wide, asked and failed to respond. PEPE TONO went three wide
around the turns and weakened. TURNAROUND showed speed along the inside, led clear to the three-eighths pole, headed by a trio of rivals approaching
the quarter pole and caved to the pressure.
