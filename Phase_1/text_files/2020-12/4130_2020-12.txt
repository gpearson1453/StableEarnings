Footnotes
TYLER'S TEK bumped both sides at the start, raced in range through the early stages, went between rivals at the seven-sixteenths pole, remained off the
rail then angled in upper stretch, bid inside the top pair and dug in late for the score. INCREDIBLE LUCK went four wide around the first turn, stalked off the
inside or outside a rival, entered the stretch four wide, bid outside the leader and was floated out near the quarter pole, cleared rival mid-stretch, flattened a
bit late late and was overtaken. HOT SOCKS dueled for the lead outside a rival to the stretch, cleared inside rival then shifted out at the quarter pole, lost
command in upper stretch, then stayed on gamely and came back at the leader in the final sixteenth and missed the place. REMEMBERTOBREATHE
raced three wide around the first turn, four wide around the second, stayed within striking distance in the drive but went evenly late. HEY SEQUOIA tucked
inside on the first turn, remained inside then a bit off the rail into the stretch, moved out further in the lane and finished willingly. TEQUILA BLANCO bumped
leaving the gate, sat off the pace, saved ground into the stretch and improved position. WRITE ME A SONG took the first turn three wide or outside a rival,
went four to five wide around the far turn and weakened. MAGIC MOSCO dueled for the lead from inside to the stretch and gave way. DEVIL'S TEETH
bumped at the start, stalked the pace near the inside, saved ground then angled out in the lane and tired. MUHNEY LINE went five then four wide around
the first turn, entered the far turn in the two path, angled out into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
FABOZZI stalked in the two path, bid inside the top pair at the five-sixteenths, took control shortly after, cleared at the top of the lane and held well in the
late stages. BLACK STORM steadied nearing the first turn, settled a bit off the rail, went between rivals at the half-mile pole, angled to the rail and saved
ground into the stretch and finished well to earn the place. SIZZLING JAMIE chased three wide then moved up to press the leader from outside on the
backstretch, headed rival at the thee-eighths pole, floated out by rival leaving the bend then finished willingly in the final furlong. R CHA CHA away quickly
and cleared the field, angled into the two path on the first turn, pressured up the backstretch, headed at the three-eighths pole, drifted out leaving that turn
and flattened to a minor award. DEBT MONGER in range off the inside to the stretch and flattened in the late stages. BUSTER DOUGLAS (BRZ) went four
wide around the clubhouse turn, remained off the inside then came six to seven wide into the stretch and weakened. MORE HONOR traveled off the rail
then between foes on the backstretch, four deep at the half-mile point, exited the far turn four wide and never responded to urging. MOST DETERMINED
tracked the pace inside and lacked a rally. IMPLICITLY went four wide around the first turn, five deep at the halfway marker, angled in and raced two to
three wide into the stretch and could not rally. LIFELINE raced four wide around the first turn then angled to the inside, saved ground and was never
involved.

through the final furlong but was too late. HEART RIVER traveled outside a rival around the first turn and backstretch, angled out around the far turn, came
five wide into the stretch, rallied but was not enough. LUCKY STEPPER vied between for the lead to the stretch, clung to a short lead mid-stretch, lost
command nearing the eighth pole and yielded late. INFO'S TREASURE angled to the inside early and settled off the pace, saved ground to the stretch and
improved position. SAPPHIRE SILK vied three deep then outside a rival to mid-stretch and gave way. BELLA FIGURA (IRE) vied for the lead from inside to
upper stretch and weakened. WINE AT SUNSET well placed off the inside behind the top trio, chased outside a rival leaving the backstretch and around the

SEQUENTIALLY chased along the inside then moved out into the two path around the turn, drew alongside MR. LOVEJOY nearing the eighth pole, dug in
late and edged the runner-up. MR. LOVEJOY sped clear early, showed the way into the stretch, held a diminishing lead approaching the furlong grounds,
met challenger in deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. OIL CAN KNIGHT tracked four wide through the turn and bested the rest. SWEET RIVER BAINES
forwardly placed while outside a rival, went three wide into the stretch and weakened. FLIP THE COIN JAN lacked early speed, angled in on the turn and
made no impact. BLACKOUT (FR) settled early, raced a bit off the rail around the bend and never showed the needed response when called upon.

Footnotes
SWIFT NONNI vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals, went two wide into the turn then three wide and clear into the stretch, then powered away through the
final furlong. TEN THE SMART WAY chased from the far outside, seven wide into the turn, angled into the two path around the bend, rallied and gained the
place. AMAZEN GRAZEN took the turn four wide, moved out a bit further in the drive and finished well for the show honors. SQUARED SHADY vied for the
lead between foes, lost contact with the winner while four wide leaving the turn and weakened in the late stages. SIRCAT NELLY vied three deep for
command, could not keep pace with the top pair around the bend, entered the drive five wide and faded. ALWAYS FOR MONEY stumbled at the start,
chased along the inside to the stretch and flattened out. CHIEFTESS AINE bumped by JEANNE B early, raced outside a rival or two wide around the turn
and could not rally. JEANNE B crowded and bumped with inside rival early, chased six wide into the turn, angled into the three path around the bend and
proved no menace. ZU ZU FLYNN was always outrun. COCO'S JOY fractious and unseated rider in the gate, raced between early then angled in on the
turn, steered back out in upper stretch, eased late in the drive and walked off.
