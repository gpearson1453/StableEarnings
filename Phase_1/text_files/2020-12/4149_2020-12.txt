Footnotes
MY WISE CAT broke alertly then angled in while sent hard to the lead, controlled the action along the rail on the turn, responded well when set down in
upper stretch, drifted out near the eighth-pole then was straightened by the rider, responded well in the final furlong and held gamely under strong urging.
BOOTSIE'S GALAXY was bumped at the start then forced out and dropped back while in tight, settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, moved to
the two path outside the quarter-pole then three wide into the stretch, altered in from behind a skirmish at the three-sixteenths, rallied along the rail under a
right-handed whip, closed fast to make a bid into the final sixteenth but couldn't get by the winner while just able to get the place. HOORAY AUSTIN broke
out and a step slow, moved up then settled off the pace, dropped in late on the backstretch, went three wide early on the turn, moved four then five wide late
on that bend, came six wide into upper stretch, chased into the final furlong, gained on the winner late and finished with good courage to just miss the place
while clear for the show. ZELIG broke a step slow, moved up under urging on the outside, advanced four to five wide on the turn, chased into the final
furlong and was out-kicked. CABO'S RUMOR settled well back in the field, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, angled out at the
three-sixteenths and improved position. CHARGE THE LINE was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside to the two path on the turn, was asked while
trying to go through a very slim hole at the quarter-pole, bumped with BENDING SAINT and put that foe in tight, chased into the final furlong under a drive
and lacked the needed kick. WAR COUNT chased the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, bumped with a rival in upper stretch, dropped back into the
final furlong and weakened. DREWCITABLE broke out and bumped with a foe, settled towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path, angled out in
the stretch and failed to threaten. DOUBLE BARREL MAN was urged along on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn, swung seven wide into upper
stretch and failed to rally. BENDING SAINT was hustled from the start, moved out while chasing the pace, made a bid in the two to three path on the turn,
was bumped turning into upper stretch then checked between horses around the three-sixteenths and dropped out. Following a stewards' inquiry into the
stretch run, no change was made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
QUICK TEMPO brushed with a rival at the start while breaking fast, quickly sped clear, opened up a sizable advantage, raced inside on the turn, responded
well when set down in upper stretch and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. GAGETOWN bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the
pace, went around most of the turn in the two path, dropped to the rail for room late on that bend, was asked for his best in upper stretch and finished
willingly for the place. TWILIGHT BLUE broke in but was quickly corrected by the rider, settled in second position while well behind the leader, was asked in
the three path on the turn, rubbed saddles with a rival in upper stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong, gained some late and missed the place
while clear for the show. CRIME SPREE broke out and was last to commence, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn, rubbed saddles with
a foe in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. TATE broke in then brushed with a rival, settled in third position, saved ground under urging on the
turn, steadied while pinched back inside of GAGETOWN inside the five-sixteenths, was put to a drive into upper stretch and lacked the needed response.
SERMONONTHEMOUNT came out at the start and bumped with a foe, settled at the rear, drifted out near the five-eighths then dropped well behind, moved
in to save ground on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. WARLOCK DOC bumped with foes on both sides at the start, was
taken up early then rated off the pace, went three wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. Following the race, the rider of
CRIME SPREE claimed foul against TWILIGHT BLUE for alleged interference in upper stretch. After the stewards' review, no change was made to the order
of finish.

Footnotes
ARCHIDUST was well placed down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole, moved out under a drive in upper stretch,
shifted further out while gaining into the final sixteenth and closed strongly to overhaul the dueling leaders in the final forty yards. JUST MIGHT disputed the
pace on the outside, was asked for his best in upper stretch, dueled outside of HOLLIS into the final sixteenth and narrowly got the best of that foe for the
place but was overtaken by the winner. HOLLIS was away alertly, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, came under a
drive in upper stretch, dueled inside of JUST MIGHT to the sixteenth-pole and just missed the place. LOOKIN TO STRIKE broke a half-step slow, settled
under some urging, shifted from the two path to the four path midway on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved position. FAST BOAT settled
on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. REAL NEWS chased the early pace,
dropped back in the two path on the turn and lacked the needed response while gaining some ground late. TELL YOUR DADDY broke out and a step slow,
raced well back on the outside, went around the turn in the two path, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. EMBOLDEN was urged along off
the pace, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. GUILDSMAN (FR) veered in at the start and was off a bit slow,
saved ground at the rear, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor.

to win ridden out. BLAMEWORTHY showed speed then chased the pace, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, took the lead
at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner outside the furlong marker and proved no match while clear for the place. WINDCRACKER bumped

needed kick while well clear for the show. COOL BOBBY was hustled to the lead, went around the first turn in the two path, set the pace well off the inside
