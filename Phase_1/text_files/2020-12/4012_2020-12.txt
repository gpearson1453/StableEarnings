Footnotes
COMMISSIONER BIGGS sowed good early speed to set the pace along the inside and drew off through the stretch to be well clear under steady handling.
TIZ AUCTION TIME stalked the pace, raced along the inside throughout and was no match for the winner. BALTIMORE BUD was allowed to settle off the
early pace, raced towards the inside and had not enough in the drive. KUKULKAN pressed the leader early on while racing two deep and weakened the
final quarter of a mile. PAPA LEW broke to the outside sharply to begin, stalked early on, raced five wide past the quarter pole and never threatened.
ROYAL TRUMPET was slow early, raced three deep in the stretch and never threatened. THE FIRE WITHIN was off slowly and never menaced.

Footnotes
GHOST ON A MISSION was allowed to settle early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and finished well to prevail under all out pressure. CLASSY
SOLUTION set all the pace while racing along the inside throughout and couldn't hold off the winner in the latter stages to finish second best. GLORIOUS
WEEKEND was off a step slow, moved up five wide past the quarter pole and closed in well late. WIND RIDGE stalked the early pace, saved ground
throughout, raced in tight quarters nearing the eighth pole and had not enough late. WATCHTHEBOURBON stalked the pace from the outside, raced three
wide through the lane and weakened. BOLD TREK stalked early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. THE EXCEPTION was
allowed to settle early and failed to have a response.

GUN LAW stalked the early pace, moved up up three wide into the upper stretch to challenge the early leader, drifted in a bit nearing the eighth pole and
drew off late to be well clear under left handed urging. BANANAS ON FIRE showed good early speed while racing along the inside and was clearly second
best. DA CHROME settled off the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and showed good late interest. PIRATE'S PALACE dropped back early,
raced five wide at the quarter pole and had no response. LUXERO saved ground down the backstretch through the far turn and never was a serious threat.
CHARLIE POTATOES stalked the early on while racing four deep, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. SPANISH D'ORO was slow
early, steadied in traffic entering the turn, raced six wide in the stretch and never menaced. CRACK THE SAFE pressed the leader from the inside and tired
readily.

Footnotes
JAXON TRAVELER was quick to begin to set all the pace and held gamely under steady handling. SINGLINO pressed the leader while racing two wide
down the backstretch, raced in the four path through the drive and finished willingly to the wire. LATIN SPICE was slow early, moved up six wide through the
lane and made a good late bid. AIN'T DA BEER COLD stalked the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough.
ALWAYSINAHURRY settled off the early going, raced four wide nearing the eighth pole and had no response. DOUBLEOSEVEN stalked the pace, saved
ground and never threatened. HUNTER JOE was off slowly and trailed.
