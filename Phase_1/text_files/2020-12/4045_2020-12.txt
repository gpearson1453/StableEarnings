JUDGE REESE was away alertly and quickly made the lead, was nicely rated on the front end through slow fractions, prevailed late under right handed
urging. CAUSE OF LOVE pressed the winner throughout on the rail, held grudgingly in the stretch and was clearly second best. DANCING GRACE raced
close up until mid stretch, then weakened slightly. WELLOILEDCAT was allowed to settle and failed to menace. OHIO STORM had good position three wide
and tired in the stretch. LEMON SLUSH never far back, tired on the far turn.
