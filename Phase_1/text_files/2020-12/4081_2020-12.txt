Footnotes
LILL QUEEN B soon led, took token pressure from CLASSOFSIXTYNINE in the opening furlong, set the pace while saving ground around the bend, opened
up when driven in upper stretch and held safe. CLASSOFSIXTYNINE pressed the pace inside of LILL QUEEN B in the opening furlong, settled back to track
that foe, continued to track two wide on the turn, proved no match for the pacesetter into the lane, but kept on with interest three wide to hold the place.
CREAL DREAMER tracked the leading pair outside of FLAMING and SOULANDGRACE early, continued to chase the leading trio in the five to six path
around the turn, came into the lane three wide, kicked on with a rally in the final furlong, improved between horses and missed the place.
COLOROFACLOUD settled toward the rear, was pushed along into the turn, began to improve past the three eighths while saving ground, continued to rally
while under a drive inside in the lane, and was outkicked for the place. FLAMING raced at the inside of the tracking flight early, chased the leading pair
inside of CREAL DREAMER on the turn while racing in the four path, was driven three wide into the lane, drifted out, and flattened in the final furlong.
DIAMOND STELLAR settled near the rear of the main group, continued in the six path toward the rear on the turn, came into the lane in the six path, and
lacked the needed kick. SOULANDGRACE tracked between horses early, settled back to chase into the turn, was driven in the five path around the bend
and into the lane, but came up empty. WICKED SOPRANO settled at the rear of the main group, raced in the rear flight in the seven to eight path on the
turn, went to a drive past the five sixteenths, turned for home in the seven path, and made no bid. SHE APPEALS HOLY was slow into stride, soon lost
touch with the field, trailed around the turn, was eased down the stretch, but crossed the wire under her own power and walked off.

Footnotes
TAPALONG led the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and continued to draw off in the final furlong
under a drive. QUIET DRAMA chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter
pole, and continued to chase the eventual winner home, the best of the rest. POLLY WAR CRY brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, trailed
the field on the rail in the early going, began to move up from the three path around the turn and continued to gain ground on the outside, while never
threatening the top two. RENOVATION brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly between horses in the stretch. LUSCIOUS raced in the middle of the pack on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the three path, began an outside bid approaching the quarter pole and was outkicked while
drifting slightly in the stretch. LAURA ATTACK stalked the leader on the outside early, entered the turn in the two path, began a bid approaching the three
eighths pole, entered the stretch in the three path and weakened from there. GRADED ATTITUDE raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the four path and made no bid. APRIL'S GEM chased the frontrunner on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path
between horses around the turn and faded on the rail in the final furlong. STOLEN GLANCE stumbled slightly leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack
on the inside, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. COOKIN ROSES stalked the leader on the outside early, navigated the turn from the three
path, began to drop back in upper stretch and continued to tire from there. SILVER N LACE trailed the field on the outside early, saved ground around the
turn and was never involved. WHOA NELLIE GIRL hopped up leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began to
drop back while racing in the two path around the far and finished far behind the field.

RICHIESGOTGAME was hard to settle early, settled better when taken to the outside, rallied three wide on the turn, gave chase to VALIANT VINNY down
the lane, reeled him in while under a drive just past the sixteenth pole, and ran clear. VALIANT VINNY broke outward but still sharply, set the pace down the
backstretch and in the two path on the turn, kept on under a drive in the lane, but was reeled in by the winner just past the sixteenth mark and proved no
match from there. VERRAZANOINTHESKY was pushed along to track the leading pair, continued to track under urging while saving ground on the turn,
came into the lane inside under a drive, proved no match for the leading pair, but salvaged the show. BEEALEA hit the gate, settled inside of KING'S
STORY at the rear of the main pack early, was outpaced into the turn, began to improve position in the three to four path under a drive past the three
eighths, swung five wide into the lane, sustained a mild rally in the lane but missed the show. MOMMAS BOY OTIS chased well off the inside early,
continued four wide on the turn behind the tracking flight, proved no match for the leaders into the lane and weakened inside. MON AMI FUZZIE broke
slowly and soon lost touch with the pack, trailed through the turn, and passed outside tired horses in the lane. CACHACO tracked the leader outside of
VERRAZANOINTHESKY early, continued in range between horses on the turn, began to weaken from the five sixteenths and continued to fade in the four
path in the lane. KING'S STORY settled outside of BEEALEA at the rear of the main group early, was outpaced in the two path on the turn, and continued to
fade in the lane.

Footnotes
STORMY EMPIRE raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, began to move up from the three path around the turn, swung wide
to enter the stretch from the four path, came into contact with PRANCIPANTS near the three sixteenths pole, moved up to duel for the lead with a furlong to
go and prevailed on the outside from there. GET NONE chased the leader on the outside in the early going, began a bid from the three path nearing the
three sixteenths pole, dueled gamely between horses from the eighth pole on and relinquished the lead in the final strides. JOLIE RULER pressed the pace
on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, moved up to challenge entering the stretch, dueled for the lead on the inside down
the lane and weakened in the final strides. I DON'T WANT TO GO hit the gate at the break, settled to race in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run
up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid passing the five sixteenths pole and gained ground in late stretch.
STOPSHOPPINGAMY raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter
pole and gained ground on the outside late. PRANCIPANTS chased the leader on the inside early, raced in the two path around the turn, ran into tight
quarters at the three sixteenths pole and was subsequently hit in the nose by the crop of the rider on STORMY EMPIRE, tossed her head in reaction to that,
switched to the outside to continue her run and flattened out from there. PALAGO raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of
a mile, angled out to run in the three path around the turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. TAP'S LULLABY raced off the pace between horses up
the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and came up empty in the stretch. RISKY RISKY RISKY trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in
the three path around the turn and offered no bid. BE AUTHENTIC raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, came around the turn in the three
path and faded in the stretch. BOBBIE TOO TOO led the field up the backstretch, dueled for the lead while saving ground around the turn, began to drop
back entering the stretch and continued to tire from there. AN OBJECTION WAS FILED BY THE RIDER OF PRANCIPANTS AGAINST THE RIDER OF
STORMY EMPIRE FOR THE INCIDENT WITH THE CROP AT THE THREE SIXTEENTHS POLE. AFTER REVIEW, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED
STORMY EMPIRE AND PLACED HER SIXTH.

CAPTURE A VICTORY was pushed to a clear lead early, saved ground while setting the pace through the turn, kept on well clear despite racing a little
greenly while under firm hand urging in upper stretch, continued under a drive through midstretch, and always held command. WAR COLORS raced in the
tracking flight three wide between horses early, tracked the leading pair into the turn, took the bend in the four path, was driven in upper stretch, proved no
match for the winner, but got up for place in the final furlong. ENGLISH tracked four wide early, advanced to track the leader approaching the turn, tracked
the leader in the three path on the turn, was driven in upper stretch, proved no match for the leader, and was outfinished for place. LOVEY DOVEY broke a
step slowly, settled at the inside of the chasing flight, lost position when hard to settle past the half mile mark, raced near the rear in the two to three path on
the turn, improved under a drive in upper stretch, and was taken in hand late when clear for fourth but well behind the leading trio. NURSE SADIE settled
near the rear, was pushed along for a bid three wide between horses into the turn, chased in the four to five path on the bend, kept on between horses to
midstretch but weakened late. TANGO CITY settled near the rear outside of NURSE SADIE, was pushed along for a four wide bid into the turn, chased in
the six path around the bend, was taken out near the center of the track in the lane, but lacked the needed kick. BETTER ANGELS settled at the rear, raced
in the four path on the turn, was pushed along hard near the five sixteenths and driven in the three to four path in upper stretch, and lacked the needed rally.
DIAMONDS AND BOOTS raced between horses in the chasing flight early, settled back toward the rear into the turn, saved ground around the bend, and
came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
RICH E Z raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, angled in to save ground around the far turn,
began to improve position approaching the five sixteenths pole, took over entering the stretch and drew off to the wire. JUSTENUFFTUFF raced in the five
path around the first turn, came up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, continued to run wide around the far turn, entered the stretch in the four
path, and gained ground on the outside from there. ITSALLABOUTYOU brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the four path around
the first turn, settled behind the leaders on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path approaching the quarter pole and
gained ground between horses in late stretch. TALKING ZIP chased the leader from the two path around the first turn, moved up to challenge while racing
up the backstretch, dropped back slightly around the far turn, entered the stretch from the two path and made a mild rally to improve position in the final
sixteenth of a mile. TETSU hopped up leaving the break and then bumped with the horse to his inside, recovered to save ground around the first turn, raced
in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, made a mild move from the three path around the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. BEAR
TRAPPE brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the fist turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the
pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and weakened in the stretch. HALF OF MANHATTAN angled in to lead the field from the two
path around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground while still showing the way around the far turn and tired in the stretch. ANGELINO raced in
the three path around the first turn, settled in to stalk the leaders for the run up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn
and continued to tire in the stretch. MCHENRY trailed the field from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from
the two path and was never a factor. SWITHERAL was squeezed back leaving the gate, clipped heels, lost his rider, was caught on the backstretch and
walked off. THERE IS NO HALF MILE TIME FOR THIS RACE DUE TO A TIMING ERROR.

Footnotes
ROAD GAME chased four wide down the backstretch, began to rally in the five path past the seven sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch,
sustained his rally under a drive, caught GUARD YOUR GRILL near the sixteenth and ran clear. AZUSA ST. tracked the leading pair down the backstretch
and in the three path on the turn, raced in range between horses in upper stretch, could not match ROAD GAME into the final furlong, but ran on well
enough to get up for place in the final forty yards. GUARD YOUR GRILL set the pace down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was driven near
the three sixteenths, clung to the lead past the furlong mark, was caught by ROAD GAME near the sixteenth mark, weakened and lost place in the final forty
yards. W W RUSSIAN GOLD settled at the rear well off the inside, continued in the four path at the rear on the turn, swung seven wide in upper stretch, and
rallied to prove best of the rest. CREAL WONDER chased three wide between horses early, continued three wide into the turn, drifted back toward the rear
in the four to five path past the three eighths, was driven inside horses in upper stretch, drifted out past the three sixteenths, kept on willingly but was
outkicked for fourth. CRANKSHAFT settled at the rear of the chasing group, kept on in the two path toward the rear on the turn, was taken out to the four
path and driven in upper stretch, dropped back to the inside once he got past the fading CANARY ISLANDS approaching midstretch, and passed tiring
horses inside. FOLDS OF HONOR prompted the pace outside of GUARD YOUR GRILL early, tracked him in the three to four path on the turn, was driven
at the inside of the tracking flight in upper stretch, and weakened. JUST RUN chased two wide between horses, was in tight between horses into the turn,
chased in the four path around the bend, and weakened in upper stretch. CANARY ISLANDS chased inside foes, began to lose ground in the two path past
the seven sixteenths, went to a drive in upper stretch, but offered no response.

Footnotes
CARLOS L. dueled for the lead in the opening strides, pulled ahead to lead outright headed into the turn, raced in the two path around the turn, continued to
draw off through the stretch and was ridden out to the wire. MALPAIS raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn,
began a bid on the rail approaching the quarter pole, and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. THE TABULATOR dueled for the lead early, was
outrun to the turn, chased the leader from the three path around the turn, moved up to challenge entering the stretch, chased the winner home and was
outmatched late. NUCLEAR OPTION raced a bit rankly in the early going, settled into to run between horses up the backstretch, angled out to find a clear
path entering the turn, entered the stretch from the three path and gained ground mildly between horses from there. IMPRESSED veered in slightly leaving
the gate, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly on the rail. WHAT'S UP DUDE
raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a move from the three path near the three eighths pole, and was
outkicked on the outside in the final furlong. DEVILEYE trailed well behind the field on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn
and made up ground in the stretch but was never a threat. BLUE SKY KOWBOY trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, raced around the turn in
the three path and gained ground in the stretch while never threatening.

Footnotes
HELLOFAGUY settled at the rear, rallied in the four path on the turn, swung seven wide under a drive into the lane, sustained his rally and rolled to the lead
in the final fifty yards. SUNNY'S STORM chased behind the tracking flight down the backstretch, was pushed for a three wide bid into the turn, tracked the
leader in the four path around the bend, kept on in range in upper stretch, loomed outside of STRIKING HEIR past the furlong mark, but did not get by that
foe until the final strides, after HELLOFAGUY had already passed to the outside. STRIKING HEIR tracked POWER CRY three deep early, advanced to
press outside that foe into the turn, took the lead at the seven sixteenths and set the pace in the three path around the bend, went to a drive in upper
stretch, dug in past the furlong mark as SUNNY'S STORM loomed to his outside, and relinquished the lead in the final fifty yards when HELLOFAGUY
passed to the outside. GONZO chased inside horses early, was pushed along in the three path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, and rallied
mildly between horses. R H SMOAKEM raced between horses toward the rear early, continued in the four path on the turn, swung five wide into upper
stretch and offered a rally, but flattened out six wide late. LITTLE BALTAR tracked the leading pair inside of DEANO early, saved ground in range through
the turn, kept on under a drive inside in upper stretch, and flattened out inside in the final furlong. DEANO was fractious in the gate, tracked the leading pair
between horses, went to a drive four wide in upper stretch, and weakened. YABA DABA DOO settled in second last, raced at the rear in the three path on
the turn, was driven four wide in upper stretch but only passed tiring horses. FOUR LEFT FEET broke slowest, was sent for position midpack outside of
foes, chased in the five path on the turn, went to a drive at the five sixteenths, turned for home six wide and came up empty. POWER CRY was hustled for
pace, set the pace until headed at the seven sixteenths, tracked the new leader until emptying out past the quarter, and weakened inside.
