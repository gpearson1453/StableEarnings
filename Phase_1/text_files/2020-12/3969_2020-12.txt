pole and was well clear while in hand the final furlong. BET AGAIN dueled from the outside early, chased the pace up the backstretch, remained forward but
was no match for the winner while clearly second best. STEPPIN' OUTONHER stalked the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced through the
second turn but was no match for the top two while holding position. SO SORRY RUSTON outrun early, advanced inside through the second turn and

Footnotes
POWER JET unhurried early from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a forward position entering the second turn, responded to
duel through the drive and inched away late. CHARLIES TICKET up close early from the inside, chased the pace up the backstretch, dueled through the
second turn, remained engaged for the drive but could not keep pace. LANGS DAY allowed to settle early, advanced inside up the backstretch, responded
entering the second turn but could only gain the show. HALOSTAR dueled from the outside early, battled up the backstretch, remained forward but had
nothing for the drive. ARCTIC ROSE was no factor. LUCKENBACHER was no threat. LOVE TO SINGH dueled from the inside and gave way. MY BOOK
forced the early pace inside and faded.

Footnotes
LAWSUIT LUCY away in good order, came in just after the start bothering TORNADO ELLIE, stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced
through the turn, responded when asked and wore down rivals the final furlong. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey's Objection, LAWSUIT LUCY was
disqualified for interference soon after the start. ARANCIA dueled from the outside early, battled through the turn, remained engaged for the drive but was
outfinished. RACELYNN pressed the early pace from the inside, remained forward, responded and was along for the show. TORNADO ELLIE was bothered
soon after the start, chased the early pace outside, responded but was too late. BROKE AND PRAYING was no real factor. CAUSEWAYCAT was no threat.
MY HEART DOMINUS dueled from the inside and tired. WILD CHARLIE was never close. FAYOLA showed little. BAYOU TIGRE refused to start and
walked off.
