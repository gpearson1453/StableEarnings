SECRET PRINCESS dueled early, shook clear on the turn, widened to win as much the best under a hand ride. SUSIES WHO was well placed, and saved
ground, was no match for winner by rallied for place. KUDA HURAA had good position throughout and went evenly. MISS BOMBON allowed to settle, failed
to menace. CUTIE PIE well placed early, had no rally. SYMPHONY HALL was no factor. CANDY FOR ALL was outrun. AWESOME MACHINE hard used
early, dropped back in the stretch.
