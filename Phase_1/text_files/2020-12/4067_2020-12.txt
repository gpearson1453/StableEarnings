Footnotes
RIGHTEOUS RENEGADE rated close to the early pace toward the inside, eased out with a four wide bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead two
deep while drifting outward approaching the head of the lane, then widened under steady handling. GREY INVASION raced off the pace in the two and
three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, was carried to the five path approaching the head of the lane, came inside the winner in the upper stretch but
had to settle for second best. WATERLOO ROSE raced in the four path the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole
and took the lead past the pole, contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn but was caught approaching the top of the stretch and flattened the final
furlong. LAUREL LAD was hustled clear and angled to the inside to set the early pace, raced at even terms into the first turn and came under pressure
toward the three eighths pole, but was caught past the pole, dropped back into the far turn and faded at the rail. KID SEVILLE raced in the five path the first
turn, bid only mildly from the seven sixteenths pole and came through the far turn still in the five path. WINDY MOSH raced well back and saved early
ground. DUNN DEAL showed little response through the backstretch. MAID THE JOURNEY rated close to the early pace two deep and raced at even terms
through the first turn, but dropped back approaching the five sixteenths pole and faded readily.

Footnotes
REILTIN OIR tapered in to stalk the early pace, rallied to the lead at the three eighths pole, dueled clear past the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far
turn and was steadily handled to widen. KIM'S PET showed the way with a slim early lead inside, was met into the backstretch and caught at the three
eighths pole, gave chase from that point but dropped back at the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear of Sainte Therese leaving the eighth pole and dug in to
hold second. FACEY'S SISTER saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, eased outward on the far turn and entered the stretch in the
four path, got up for third inside the sixteenth pole then flattened later yards. MISS FORESTER saved ground off the pace the opening turn, eased out into
the backstretch and picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn but flattened stride later yards. SAINTE THERESE
stalked early while two deep and between horses and raced at even terms into the backstretch, was caught at the three eighths pole, gave chase from that
point but weakened leaving the eighth pole. DISCO PARTY rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths and left the turn toward the outside, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response. BLACK QUEEN was steadied early and was not a factor. BRASS MAGNOLIA raced in the
four path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. OCEAN DELIGHT stalked the early pace three wide, picked up the chase leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, but faded past the three eighths.

NICALOE took quick control of the pace and was rated through the backstretch, came under pressure into the far turn and raced at the rail through the turn,
then held on well with steady encouragement. RAGTIME COWBOY JOE stalked the winner off the rail and chased that one nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path and finished well to be second best. GOOFY BOY rounded the opening turn about the three path, bid approaching
the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. TAURIAN saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and
showed little more leaving the far turn. KUSTAAFU raced off the early pace about the three path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but
faded into the far turn. BANK ON CANDY raced well off the pace and was not a factor.

IT'SMYINTENSION raced well off the pace and off the rail the first turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole and came through the far turn six wide then
dug in down the lane to take the nod the final strides. RUN ON ENERGY saved ground well off the early pace, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and
raced five wide on the far turn, dueled to the front inside the sixteenth pole but was nipped from the win in the final strides. LIKE ME OR NOT took the lead
two deep leaving the three quarter pole and rated a slim lead off the rail, came under pressure at even terms from the five sixteenths pole but was caught in
later yards, though held on for third. QUICK ENERGY settled off the early pace about the three path, bid approaching the three eighths pole and dueled at
even terms through the far turn, continued close to the finish, though, was outfinished for third. CHARITABLE ROSE raced well back about the three path
the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, ran six wide on the far turn and passed some rivals in an even
finish. IM A TRICKY ONE saved ground well off the pace, eased outward on the far turn and entered the stretch about the five path and passed some rivals.
WALKNTHEPLANK saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, but flattened stride inside
the eighth pole. LADY'S CORK settled off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, was blocked
through most of the far turn, angled out in the upper stretch and flattened stride. VINTAGE GIN raced with the pace inside and gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, but dropped back at the rail leaving the quarter pole and faded through the far turn.

Footnotes
JUBA'S HOUSE pressured the pace through the backstretch and took over approaching the top of the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and was steadily
handled to widen. SPLIT THE CHECK set a pressured pace inside, was caught approaching the head of the lane, dropped back mid-stretch and just held
on for second. MY PRETTY EYES chased the pace inside, angled to the five path on the turn and was gaining late on the runner-up. DYLADDIE gave
chase, raced off the rail on the turn and finished evenly. CHARM WEAVER raced well back from early contention, bid into the turn and raced in the three
path of the turn, eased outward in the upper stretch and finished well outside. LA RUFINA pressured the early pace but dropped back at the three eighths
pole while continuing to give chase, raced in the three path of the turn and showed little more. REAL APPEAL gave chase to no avail. WHISKEY TALKING
gave chase outside and was not a factor. MAGNIFICENT ROCKET chased the pace outside, raced in the three path of the turn and showed little more.
WOODSONG'S CASTLE saved ground.

Footnotes
V. I. P. TICKET rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace, started a bid into the backstretch and closed to the front four wide
approaching the quarter pole, dueled clear into the stretch and widened the final sixteenth. NORTH ATLANTIC settled off the pace and off the rail, bid with
the winner and closed three wide, raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn but dropped back past the eighth pole and settled for
second. AWSOME FAITH rated off the pace about the three path, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, steadily progressed in the three path of
the far turn then flattened out a distant third. RUNNIN'TOLUVYA stalked the earlier pace two deep then challenged into the backstretch, took the nod past
the half mile pole and came under pressure toward the three eighths, was caught nearing the quarter pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened
stride. BUFF'S EYE VIEW settled off the pace toward the inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, angled to the
three path into the lane and showed little more. HERO'S MAN stalked the pace three wide, bid from the seven sixteenths pole then faded into the far turn.
OPERA NITE was hustled to the front and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure when met at even terms by Runnin'toluvya, fought
back at the rail from that point then faded at the rail into the far turn. STEP OUT DANCING raced well back and was not a factor. CASTLE BOUND saved
ground.
