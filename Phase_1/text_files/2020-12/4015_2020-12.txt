DOUBLE THE LAUGH always within striking distance while settling in the five path, rallied four wide through the turn and into the stretch, dueled through the
final sixteenths and proved best in a game effort under a strong hand ride. VISKI JONES allowed to settle, loomed boldly five wide into the stretch, matched
strides from there and missed. HOMERS MAGIC pressed the pace three then four wide into the second turn, drew on even terms for the lead, battled with
the top pair until deep stretch then was outfinsihed. GIZMO JONES trailed early and passed tiring rivals in the four path. BAR STOOL BUDGET pressed the
pace along the inside into the stretch then weakened. LOOKS GOOD N A TUX bumped at the start, sprinted to the lead, set a pressured pace three then
two wide into the stretch then weakened. ISTILLGOTIT bumped at the start, prompted the pace two wide and was through after a half. NAMARUNU (GER)

ZULU LEGEND stalked the early pace, rallied four wide through the turn to engage the leader, dueled with that one past the furlong marker and finished full
of run to win going away. LEO vied for the early lead, rallied three then two wide through the turn, gained a narrow advantage, battled with the winner until
deep stretch then was no match. CUMBER pressed the pace two wide into the turn, dropped back a bit before a half then finished determinedly. SILVER G
T O offered a bid four wide into the stretch then leveled off. OVERBEARING made the lead three wide soon after the start, set the pace into the turn then
was outfinished. RULING EMPIRE close up, went evenly inside.

GOLDEN MONEY trailed into the turn, circled his field in the middle of the racetrack through the stretch and got up in the final strides, mid track. GOING
WITH STYLE never far back, rallied five wide through the stretch, made the lead late and just missed hanging on. NICK CAN FIX stalked the pace three
wide into the stretch, made the lead then was outfinished. MIDNIGHT MIKEY inside, altered course out to the three path near the half mile pole, inched
closer on the turn then came up empty in the final furlong. CHIEF RANDEL close up from the start, was shut off near the half mile marker then faded.
LITTLE BLAKER was no factor. ROYAL'D broke in front, set the pace along the inside to the top of the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
NAN'S ROSE away alertly, set all the pace under pressure and edged clear late under left handed urging. JUSTA COWGIRL was bumped and pinched
back between rivals at the start, pressured the winner the entire trip and finished well clear for second. EDGE unhurried early, had a mild late rally outside in
the six path. ISLAND CHIC was in tight along the inside at the nine sixteenths pole then failed to menace. WHERETHERE'SSMOKE bore out at the start
bumping rivals, bid three wide on the turn then came up. WEEKEND AT LAST had brief speed. BAINBRIDGE had good early speed then faded. SPIT'S
IMAGE was outrun. FORMER BUNNY bore in at the start bumping rivals, dueled for the lead along the inside into the turn then gave way. PINK HALDER
was through early.
