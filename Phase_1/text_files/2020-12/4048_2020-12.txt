Footnotes
BAYTOWN GLORY was slow leaving the gate, began a run two wide between horses into the turn, swung wide into the stretch and ran clear through the
final yards. CACTUS JACK pressed two wide outside the early leader, dueled on even terms with that one through the final furlong but couldn't withstand
the winner. RIO ABAJO made the early pace inside, dueled through the final furlong and gave way late. DOWNHILL RACER raced in good position along
the rail into the stretch, came out between horses and lacked the needed closing. LIME HOUSE LOUIE wasn't far back two wide to the stretch then tired.
RAYO MY KING stayed inside in an even effort. CHITOWN steadied sharply between horses entering the turn, swung wide into the stretch and failed to
matter. CHAMPAGNE CHILLS briefly showed speed outside. CHIT CHAT GIRL had his head turn at the break, left several lengths behind the field and
never caught up.
