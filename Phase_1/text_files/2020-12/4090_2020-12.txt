REJECTED AGAIN established the top in short order, showed the way from just off the rail, lightly hand urged on a loose-contested lead, arrived at the
three-sixteenths marker and got called upon for more, emerged a sixteenth down the lead in possession of his largest advantage, saw the runner up cut into
it substantially in the final stages, but held sway. JAKE ROCKS lightly bumped in the shadow of the gate, pursued the pace four wide on the bend,
commenced the stretch slightly wider, flashed good late foot rallying for the place. BEAVER CREEK made light contact with another right after the start,
settled towards the rear of the pack, departed the backstretch from the three path, was under a ride spinning into the fourth one for entrance into the stretch,
finished well to get up for third. MISTER BOBBY out losing his footing springing from the gate made contact with LOVERBOY LOU, went on to stalk the
pacesetter from path two, was under strong handling coming into the lane, proved no match and backed away. LOVERBOY LOU bumped at the start, made
in onto the inside route approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, finished off the run around the bend, angled out three wide coming up to the
three-sixteenths pole, got outkicked. DUBAI BOBBY taken hold being pinched at the start, travelled two wide on the turn, was slightly closer to the rail
heading onto the top of the lane, had no offering. THE GREAT DANSKY tucked into the three path, was put to the whip by midpoint on the turn, tipped one
path farther off the rail for the drive, gave way. SUPER WICKED CHARM hustled on the backstretch, failed to get motivated, was two wide both entering
and then exiting the turn, nearly trailed throughout.

coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying through the final furlong to take command seventy
yards from home and was kept to task to the finish. MRS. ORB rated just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got floated four wide through the far turn
as SINGULAR SENSATION went three wide, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide for home, rallied to take command a sixteenth
out, dug in between foes and was collared seventy yards from home and was along for the place honors. SINGULAR SENSATION coaxed from the gate,
showed the way under a firm hold along the inside through a dawdling opening half mile, floated three wide through the far turn carrying a pair of rivals four
and five wide to her outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth
out, ran on to preserve the show honors. FIRENZE FREEDOM chased two then three wide, got floated five wide through the far turn outside the top pair
and was placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued five wide into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish but was outkicked. Due to a teletimer

Footnotes
RISK TAKING away without apparent mishap, was well rated keeping watch on the front runners from the two path, got roused spinning three wide into the
lane, closed the gap, began the final furlong vying as the outermost of a threesome, emerged a sixteenth later having assumed control, kicked clear. ROCK
SUGAR came in and bumped with UNBRIDLED HONOR after stumbling at the start, recovered, pressed the pace from the two path, went by DAZZLE
TIME and got guided onto the inside route at the top of the far turn, led the way, feeling some pressure from THE REDS, himself positioned to the outside,
got roused coming into the lane, found himself three-way tussle for the top deep into the furlong grounds, yielded to RISK TAKING a sixteenth down the
road, held the place. THE REDS strung out three wide and pulling on the bit making his way around the clubhouse bend, continued on the backstretch
stalking the pace within striking distance, forced the issue from path two during the run around the second bend, came under a ride challenging in earnest
heading onto the top of the lane, did battle from between rivals for a sixteenth beginning from the eighth pole, failed to cement himself to the front end,
weakened late. UNBRIDLED HONOR was pulled off ROCK SUGAR at the start but not before some contact between them, pursued the pace from the two
path, was put to a prolonged drive at the half mile, swung into the lane, and gave way. HARDISON two wide early, shifted over to the rail midway on the
backstretch, went on to save ground to no avail. LOCHINVAR (GER) at or near the two path on the turns, was never in it. DAZZLE TIME showed the way
from the inside route until the half mile pole, folded.

LOOKBOTHWAYS chased four then five wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command a furlong out, edged clear under a drive to prevail. SHE'S A BLACK BELT broke out at the start forcing EVAN'S NICE NOW to steady off her
heels, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and kept on to secure the place honors. GRUDGE
dueled two to three wide with FLASHPACKINBARBIE to her inside, tucked to the two path through the turn and shook away midway on the bend as her
main pace rival got taken in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and was
collared a furlong out, weakened in the late stages while along well clear for the show honors. WICKED TITLE three paths off the inside down the
backstretch, went six wide through the far turn taking the scenic route, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued six wide into upper stretch and
passed tired rivals. WEDONTBELIEVEHER broke out at the start bumping APPLETINI, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide
through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and improved position. EVAN'S NICE NOW broke a beat slow then got
steadied off the heels of SHE'S A BLACK BELT who broke outwards and conceded three to four lengths to the front, chased four paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then six wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went four to five wide or home and tired. APPLETINI bumped
at the start by WEDONTBELIEVEHER, who broke outwards, chased inside briefly before tipping to the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
spun three wide for home and tired. GRAY HAZE chased along the inside until tipped three wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths,
continued three wide into upper stretch and tired. FLASHPACKINBARBIE bobbled at the start, recovered to duel to the inside of GRUDGE from the two
path, tucked inside into the turn, got taken in hand and steadied near the three-eighths and eased off the leader, spun just off the inside for home and
faltered.

Footnotes
CARTWHEEL established control in short order, cut over to the inside, was coaxed along showing the way, settled onto the head of the stretch and was
given her cue, kept going well to stay sufficiently in the clear. AWESOME ALANA stalked the pace from the two path, spun from the same one into the
stretch, won the place. WAILIN JOSIE secured a prominent position, took up the role of primary pursuer from path two during the run around the bend,
commenced the stretch slightly wider, flattened out in the last eighth, blowing second. JC'S SHOOTING STAR off the inside, pursued the pace two to three
wide on the turn, pilot urging the mount along, angled four wide into the lane, had no rally. PEACHES AND SPICE well out in the middle of the strip for the
opening half, tucked into the two path at the top of the turn, went four wide into the lane, lacked a response. GENTLE ANNIE tracked the pace from along
the inside route until the end of the bend, tipped out two wide entering the stretch, backed away. DRAGONESS sluggish seemingly from the get-go,
departed the backstretch from the two path, swung out five wide into the lane, ventured onward as having trailed throughout.

RUNABOUT chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily closing in on
the leader and was up in the final jump to prevail. GRIT AND GLORY chased along the inside in aim of the front before advancing to take narrow command
half a mile from home, knocked heads through the turn and took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive turning back FLOWERS FOR LISA
when confronted by RUNABOUT, dug in and was nailed in the very last stride to the finish. FLOWERS FOR LISA hustled from the gate, dueled three wide
with BRUSH COUNTRY early on before being engaged by the aforementioned foe into the turn, knocked heads with that foe getting set down spinning just
off the inside for home, dug in under a drive shaken off inside the eighth pole while keeping on clear for the show honors. BEACH ACCESS chased just off
the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure
the last major share. HIGH COMMAND coaxed from the gate, raced four then three wide in close aim of the duel, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun three wide for home and weakened in the late stages. CHIEF KNOW IT ALL got clipped behind near the six furlong marker by HOT DIGGITY, chased
three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. BRUSH COUNTRY showed brief
speed dueling from the two path down the backstretch, got shaken off near the half mile pole and tucked inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. OUTRAGEOUS BET five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the
turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. HAWAIIAN NOISES seven paths off the inside
down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, went seven wide for home and tired. HOT DIGGITTY bobbled
at the break, recovered to chase three wide pulling on the bit nearing the six furlong marker and clipped heels with the back of CHIEF KNOW IT ALL
bobbling heavily and losing the rider near that station. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the incident down the backstretch focusing on HOT DIGGITY
before the result stood and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
UJJAYI bumped at the start, became keen after the pilot resorted to a light hand ride to get going afterwards, checked then tipped to the outside, all this
occurring before vacating the chute, settled down to a more professional manner of running, stalked the pace confidently ridden in the four path during the
run around the turn, was still in hand coming into the lane directly abreast of the second place finisher, struck the three-sixteenths pole and was set down,
grabbed away the advantage, sparred for another sixteenth with JENNEMILY, kicked well clear after putting away the nemesis. JENNEMILY disputed the
pace from path two, came under the gun from the eventual winner as three-quarters was being completed, put up some fight before permanently replaced
on the front end, fought on until the general area of the sixteenth pole, had no difficulty salvaging second. DAPHNE MOON worked out a tuck into the two
path at the half mile pole, got roused springing from the five-sixteenths pole, angled four wide into the stretch, closed in to get up for the show. FOXTAIL
bumped with PERSISTO after stumbling at the start, assumed a forward position, vied three wide for the top until the five-sixteenths pole, stepped into the
lane and came up short of snagging away third. PERSISTO bumped from both sides in the shadow of the starting gate, got guided over to the rail,
contended for the top for three-quarters and folded. INDY UNION shifted over to the inside, came under a drive prior to the quarter pole, tipped towards path
two for the stretch run, had no offering.
