Footnotes
MUCHO SUNSHINE remained forwardly placed after a good start, sparred for command from the two path, began to shake off its fellow pace combatant as
the half was being rattled off, settled in at the top of the lane and was given his cue, got pounced upon by the second place finisher soon afterwards, began
the final furlong with the nemesis leading by the barest of margins, came out twice slightly in the final sixteenth, with the initial time being after some left side
pressure, resulting in contact with WARFRONT FIGHTER, vied onward with vigour and gamely prevailed. WARFRONT FIGHTER got set up in the three
path prior to departing the backstretch, sat poised within striking distance of the contested pace, crept up towards the ones to catch as the second split was
being finalized, got roused for the drive home, appeared to poke a head in front by the eighth pole, remained engaged eye to eye with the winner, made
some contact with that opponent leaving the sixteenth marker, with the first of two bumps/brushes being the more significant one, fought onward with
distinction but wound up the one denied. GRECIAN PHAROAH tracked the pace from just off the inside route, stepped into the lane and was outfinished.
CONFECTIONER argued for control with the winner for the opening half while taking the inside route, faltered. HEIGHT pinched in the shadow of the
starting gate, pursued the pace two to the three wide on the bend, launched no bids. TRAVELIN DANI strung out four wide and under a drive on the turn,
gave way.

Footnotes
DANCING BUCK sparred for command two to three wide, took charge as the second fraction was being finalized, was coming up to the three-sixteenths
pole when set down, dug in well to fend off the sole stretch threat, kept busy to the end. REGGAE MUSIC MAN stalked the pace in midpack from path two,
was let loose for the drive home, was worked towards path four with left side pressure in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, got staved off. BINGO JOHN took
up the chase from path three on the turn, got roused by the five-sixteenths pole, angled five wide turning into the lane, went on to secure the show.
OLIVER'S FORTUNE sighted two to three wide at the top of the turn, got sent out into path six from upper to midstretch, made no headway. LOBSTA
chased the pace from path two on the turn, stepped into the stretch, lacked the necessary response. HEYMACKIT'SJACK in range two wide for nearly a
half, commenced the stretch approximately four wide, folded. INTERSTATE two wide onto the turn, tipped into the three path exiting it, launched no bids.
WRITER'S REGRET disputed the pace from along the inside route for the initial half, faltered. DAMILANO pursued the pace three to four wide, as the
widest of all, was moved into path five for entrance into the stretch, gave way.

Footnotes
FIRE SWORD established control in short order, sailed along on the inside route showing the way on a loosely-contested advantage, drifted out towards the
four path from upper to midlane, was still comfortably in the clear when taken in hand for the last forty yards. PROSPECT MOUNTAIN three wide onto the
turn, angled into the path five exiting it, rallied for the place. CONFORMIST stalked the pace three wide, got set down approaching the five-sixteenths
marker, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, got outkicked. CIVIL WAR eyed the leader from the pocket, kept pace before weakening in the
final furlong. SAM AND SY worked out a tuck into the two path nearing the top of the turn, swung out five wide for the drive, failed to fire. GHOST STALKER
pursued the pace two to three wide, angled five wide entering the lane, made no headway. LET'S WORKOUT chased the pace from between rivals, in
between rivals for a good portion of the opening half, folded. JACOBA hung out four wide on the bend, had no response. DE ONLY SOLUTION stumbled in
awkward manner springing from the gate, went on to save ground to no avail.

getting geared down in the late stages to the finish. DURKIN'S CALL four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home,

Footnotes
LETMETAKETHISCALL took up position in midpack after the field had been sent off and running, underwent a two wide journey on the turn, flashed interest
as the half was being completed, angled towards path four for clearance in upper stretch and kicked into her best, rolled by the front runners with
approximately a sixteenth to go and edged clear. PALOMITA grabbed the advantage, cut onto to the inside route approaching the conclusion of the
backstretch, led the way, feeling only mild pressure from the primary pursuer, settled in upper stretch and was called upon for more, got reeled in right
around the sixteenth pole, narrowly saved second. GLASS CEILING prompted the pace two to three wide, swung into the lane, had no closing punch.
DOVEY LOVEY departed the backstretch from the three path, got sent out five wide for the drive, mustered up a mild response. LUCKY DIME saved ground
for the opening half, tipped into path two at the top of the lane, came up empty. MADAM MACLEAN chased the pace from path two on the bend, shifted out
one wider for the stretch run, gave way.

Footnotes
EMPRESS LUCIANA struck the near side stall at the start, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong to take command a sixteenth out as GRAPE THERAPY came outwards at
that station, then inched away to the finish to prevail. GRAPE THERAPY coaxed from the gate, tussled briefly with CRYSTAL STEPS before taking over
command at the nine-sixteenths while four to five paths off the rail, tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun
three wide for home, dug in under a drive under growing threat, came out near the sixteenth marker under a near sided stick and was collared at that
station, then ran on to safely preserve the place honors. VITANZA bobbled at the start recovering inwards and bumping SWEET SNEAK, chased four paths
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home
and weakened in the late stages just holding on for the show honors. SWEET SNEAK bumped at the start by VITANZA who recovered inwards from a
bobble, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. QUEENTIGUA lost her
footing at the start, recovered to chase five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and offered no rally.
JUDICIARY chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and offered up a mild bid by tired rivals. CRICK
chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. MIZZYS IMAGE coaxed from the gate,
chased three to four wide coaxed along from three furlongs out, went seven wide into upper stretch, offered no response. SOPHIE FATALE coaxed from the
start, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide near the half mile pole before taking to the two path through the turn, swung
three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. LUCKY LIZZIE struck the off side stall at the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went five wide for home and made no impact. CRYSTAL STEPS hustled from the gate, showed the way early on two to three wide until
headed for command at the nine-sixteenths, briefly tussled before tucking to chase along the inside through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch
in retreat and tired. LA REINE ROUGE chased six then five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and was unable to
make an impact. PLINK FREUD bobbled at the break, chased six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn,
went four wide for home, tired and was eased through to the finish.
