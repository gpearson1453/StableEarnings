flattened the final sixteenth. BOUNDTOBEBAD settled off the pace inside then picked up the chase toward the five sixteenths pole, raced close at the rail
nearing the head of the stretch then flattened stride the final furlong. WHOA BLACK BETTY raced well off the pace about the three path the opening turn
and settled outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path but showed little further. ANGLE OF
ATTACK took the lead at the three quarter pole and angled to the inside entering the first turn, showed no response from the mid point of the far turn,

Footnotes
THEHEATOFTHENIGHT raced with a hotly contested pace, was bumped out leaving the turn but dug in to recover stride and widened later yards. NATIVE
COURAGE contested the pace and led between calls, raced at the rail on the turn but bore out to make contact with Theheadofthenight leaving the turn,
continued even terms through the upper stretch, though, ceded the final sixteenth. GRAN WILDROCKY chased the pace inside and rounded the turn at the
rail, dueled close through the upper stretch but flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. ADIOS SEE YA chased the pace and raced in the three path of the
turn, drifted into the stretch then flattened out. MARSEILLE'SCOWTOWN broke a step slow and gave only distant chase well off the rail and never factored.
ANOTHER MOVE rounded the turn about the six path and was not a factor. THE BOOK OF ROD saved ground.

Footnotes
SHAMROCK KID settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, took the lead past the three eighths
pole, raced clear into the far turn and proved much the best under steady handling. THE IRON BANK raced off the pace in the three and four paths then bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five path, dug in leaving the turn and reached second the final yards. HOBE SOUND
saved ground off the early pace then eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn then ceded
second the final yards. LION LORD pressured the pace three wide through the front stretch and took a slim lead past the half mile pole, was caught leaving
the three eighths but continued chase to the quarter pole, dropped back from that point then weakened the final furlong. CAPE LOOKOUT was hustled
along to set the early pace, headed into the backstretch and gave chase from that point, but dropped back leaving the three eighths pole and weakened at
the rail on the far turn. FORTY FATHOMS pressured the pace through the front stretch and continued to give chase through the backstretch but faded into
the far turn.
