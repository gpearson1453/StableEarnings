Footnotes
KISS MY GRITS tracked the top trio through early stages and remained in a forward position while still in hand at the quarter pole, given cue turning for
home, dug in along the rail in striking distance past the furlong marker, stayed on determinedly under strong-handling and got a nose up in time.
JUSTABOUTRIGHT matched strides for the lead in the opening quarter then held a slight edge, stayed firm over rivals around the turn then hustled along
two wide in the drive, continued to put in a good effort under steady pressure then got nipped when winner slipped through in final stride. SNOWTRICK
raced off the early pace then roused for more around the turn, hustled along five wide into the lane, gathered momentum under pressure and closed with
response. FANNY B prompted the pace in early stages and remained in striking distance approaching the quarter pole, stayed on under pressure in upper
stretch then ran on evenly in the final furlong. SHANGHAI SALLY hustled along the outside on the turn, got carried out wider into the drive and lacked a
needed rally. D' CINNAMON GIRL matched strides for the early lead, remained forwardly placed in aim around the turn then failed to sustain bid in the lane.
MIZONEY hustled along under steady encouragement, raced five wide into the lane and failed to move into striking range. FLASHY BISONETTE raced in
the back, hustled along into the stretch but failed to move on.

Footnotes
LOVE MY RIDE advanced after initial strides to challenge ZIP TIE for the lead, vied for the lead entering the turn, began to edge away with three furlongs
left to run, hustled along two wide into stretch run, widened under steady pressure in upper stretch then finished going away. EURO SUPRISE positioned
three wide in aim for the lead leaving the backstretch, could not maintain near equal terms with the winner mid-way on the turn but stayed on with response
and settled for second best. YOUNG SKYWALKER hustled along under steady urging and chased the top trio into the turn, sustained a steady two wide bid
through the lane and prevailed for a share. SARACEN raced off the top flight leaving the backstretch, sustained a steady bid racing four wide going by the
quarter pole then flattened out in the lane. OUR SILVER TEMPLE hustled along in steady pursuit along the outside, kept under left handed pressure while
racing four to five wide in upper stretch but failed to move on. KIMS ADONIS raced off the early pace then moved into stretch run five wide and lacked a
needed rally. ZIP TIE was away in good order and led briefly before taking on the challenge from the winner, vied into the turn then came up empty nearing
the quarter pole. GOING TO BE WILDER lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn and failed to move into contention.

EUTYCHIA raced off the early speed and hustled along two wide around the turn, stayed on under steady pressure into stretch run, gathered strong
momentum in the final furlong, finished determinedly two wide and got up in time. TESUQUE lacked early speed and raced in the back, hustled along
through the turn and four to five wide into the lane, edged up into contention mid-stretch, stayed on with response and steadily gained to the wire. HUNNY
HUSH applied pace pressure to the early leader, remained in aim two wide still racing in hand going by the quarter pole, given cue turning for home, cleared
on top nearing the furlong marker then began to show signs on fatigue with a sixteenth left to run and gave way. JULIARD HONOR got bumped a couple
times at the start and raced off the pace, roused through the turn then gained ground to move into contention with a furlong left to run, briefly advanced into
striking distance then yielded late. BETWEEN THE ARCHES raced off the early speed and put to a drive around the turn, hustled along five wide into the
lane and had a mild improve without threatening. SIGICRICKET raced in early contention and chased two wide around the turn then gave way in upper
stretch. DEJA SUE set a pressured pace and tired in stertch run. LISA SMILES showed brief response the faded top stretch.

Footnotes
DO YOU BILEVE was away in good order and stalked the pace down the backstretch, headed in pursuit of the leader leaving the far turn, dug in under a
strong left handed drive in upper stretch, kept on determinedly under steady pressure and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. GOSPEL GINA led the way by
a slim margin around the first turn, edged away to clearer lead and set the pace down the backstretch, continued to hold firm over DO YOU BELIEVE in
upper stretch then failed to hold off the winner in late stages. OKIE BECKAROO settled through early stages then hustled up around the far turn, saved
ground then tipped out top of the lane and ran on for a share. GOSPEL CARLOTTA moved head up slightly at the start then hesitated briefly upon entering
the first turn, continued off the pace down the backstretch, hot the top of the lane six wide and needed more for late impact. QUIET SURPRISE raced off the
pace, hustled up three wide entering the far turn, kept under a strong left-handed drive near the inside in upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. NO
LETTIN GO was forwardly placed racing behind the early leader, continued in range around the far turn then faded in upper stretch. SOONER FACTOR
raced in contention down the backstretch then came up empty and retreated on the final turn.

Footnotes
WICKED FLASHBACK advanced to the lead after initial strides and led the way by a narrow margin into the turn, roused for more turning for home, dug in
determinedly under steady pressure, stayed sharp in response and remained clear. LA ROSA DRIVE was forwardly placed in opening stages and continued
just off the leader into the turn, launched a two wide bid for command near the quarter pole, sustained a steady bid for WICKED FLASHBACK but could not
get to firm-holding winner and settled for second best. NEON DREAMS raced in contention and tracked the pace to the turn, hustled up turning for home,
continued with interest and sustained a steady effort to clear a share. QUICK CALISIA was away in good order then raced up close in range of the early
leader, roused for more with three furlongs left to run but failed to advance and steadily weakened. MOCHA KISS raced off the early pace, saved ground
around the turn and failed to to gain a contending position. A FAST BROAD raced in the last flight and had no response when called upon. GLORIOUS
ROSE was not far back in the opening quarter then failed to keep pace and steadily faded.

seven wide entering top stretch and finished strongly for second best. CHIM CHIM GEMINI raced in range to the turn, moved up four wide nearing the
quarter pole, led the way into the lane then got outkicked when outside duo rallied by. ELDORADO DREAM settled through early stages, picked up the pace
on the turn, shifted out five wide top of the lane and had a mild improve. WYOME was not far back heading into the turn, hustled up four wide entering the
lane, showed response, gained position then flattened out. SWEET ADELINE raced in range through early stages, waited near the quarter pole then
launched a two wide bid in upper stretch and lacked the needed response for impact. STILL OF THE NIGHT vied for the lead into the turn, began to inch
near the lead but was overtaken by rival top of the lane then gave way. STONE TOP chased up close racing three wide then failed to advance around the

Footnotes
SPIRIT OF SPOATIE was away in good order and raced three wide around the first turn, pressed the pace down the backstretch, vied for the lead around
the far turn, edged by to take a slim lead mid-stretch then took on the challenge from JB'S LEGACY, battled back gamely, dug in from the inside position
and refused to be denied. J B'S LEGACY fanned out five wide on the first turn, stalked through the backstretch, loomed a threat three wide at the quarter
pole, was hustled along into stretch run, dug in under pressure and advanced to challenge SPIRIT OF SPOATIE for the late lead, dug in with good response
but could not get by winner. GLIMPSE OF GLORY was off a step slow at the start, continued unhurried through early stages, saved ground then picked up
the pace on the final turn, swung into action four wide into stretch run and closed with response to gain a share. YOU'REOBADBOY set a pressured pace
down the backstretch, dueled for the lead around the far turn, fought back upper stretch then gave way. BOLD IMAGE stalked through early stages, hustled
up on the far turn but failed to advance position and flattened out. SO BRAVE raced six wide in the first turn and raced off the pace, entered top stretch six
wide and lacked the needed response for impact. DELVIN TO IT settled through early stages, saved ground on the far turn and failed to rally. MR

wide entering the first turn, raced off the pace and failed to move into contention. BIG BLUE OKIE raced four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace through
