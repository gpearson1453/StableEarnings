Footnotes
TARAWA sped clear soon after the break, set the pace two wide under a light hold, was joined from the rail by FOGGY DREAMS soon into the lane,
spurted back away after being put to a drive, switched over to her left lead with a sixteenth remaining and held firm while kept to task. FOGGY DREAMS
tracked inside, bid along the rail entering the lane, failed to match strides but kept on willingly to save the place. LE WEEKEND stalked three wide, took
closer order after a half mile, gave hard chase from there and kept on with some interest though edged for second. MORTAL STORM , four wide, was under
a ride into the lane but lacked a rally. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) stumbled at the break, moved up while saving ground heading to the half mile marker,
remained inside and faded around the turn. MISS CHLOE G , outrun from the start, was eased nearing the lane and walked off.

YOU ARE AWESOME lacked speed, raced in the two path between horses around the turn, found room inside rivals through the stretch, led late and drove
clear. HELMS DEEP set the pace, raced near the rail on the turn, drifted out in mid stretch and weakened. MANKLIN CREEK , four wide around the turn,
advanced to the eighth pole then flattened out. MOONZANO , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive. TOM'S CHOICE , three
wide on the turn, weakened. TRIAL BALANCE bobbled at the break, saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and weakened under
whipping. ZOINKS SCOOBY , never a factor, hugged the inner rail on the turn.

RUNNER RUNNER INDY , three wide into the first turn, prompted the pace then took over between foes near the half mile marker, dueled between rivals
leaving the five sixteenths, shook clear under a drive past the three sixteenths, turned away threats in mid stretch then steadily widened late. GOTTAWAY
rated between runners near the five eighths, was about four wide heading to the half mile marker, dropped in some and advanced two wide into the lane,
secured the rail soon after, threatened near mid stretch then kept on willingly to be second best. STAND MY GROUND settled inside, picked up momentum
mid way on the final turn, angled four wide into the lane, ranged up to loom in mid stretch but failed to seriously sustain. TWO DOORS DOWN stalked three
wide, bid three deep nearing the half mile marker, pressed under a ride then faded through the final furlong. FOREFRONT cleared early, set the pace
towards the rail, was headed with a half mile to go, stayed on to the five sixteenths then surrendered entering the lane. CRESCENT WARRIOR broke a step
slow, was taken wide early, moved up five wide past the five eighths, pursued under a hearty ride past the three eighths then weakened. MR. MAURICE
settled off the early pace about two wide then failed to respond.

ODDS ON relaxed three wide and within range of a contested pace, advanced four wide when given his cue nearing the lane, forged past the leader and
spurted clear nearing the eighth, widened a bit then was fully extended to hold off the inside surge of REDEEM EDDIE. REDEEM EDDIE , away alertly,
flashed some speed then drafted back some to stalk three wide, came under a ride mid turn, split rivals near the sixteenth marker and finished gamely to
gain inside the winner. WHISKEY AND YOU , off the early pace and removed from the rail, moved up four wide into the lane and kept on with interest to
bridge the gap. TOM TERRIFIC broke a step slow, steadied briefly soon after, rated off the pace while saving some ground, steadied briefly near the quarter
pole, worked outward in the drive and finished with interest. MICE AND MEN , towards the inside edging up early on, steadied nearing the turn, steadied
again mid turn, awaited room from the quarter pole to almost mid stretch the finished willingly once clear. TOMMY SHELBY , bumped at the break, raced
four wide early, swung very wide for the drive and had belated action. NAUTICAL NATURE sped to the front, set a pressured pace in about the two path,
shook clear nearing the lane, could not resist the winner past the three sixteenths and weakened. SEVEN ON THE ROCKS was rated back early, came five
wide for the drive and flattened out. CHARM CITY BAND broke inward and bumped a rival, pursued towards the inside and came up empty. MOSBY'S
RANGER vied three wide outside NAUTICAL NATURE, remained a presence to the quarter pole then faltered.

Footnotes
WONDERWALL stalked the pace, raced three wide on the turn, was fanned to the six path in upper stretch, swept to command approaching the eighth pole
then drew out in the drive. NICOLAR , in the two path between horses around the turn, chased the pace in a willing effort. MOSLER'S IMAGE saved ground
around the turn, remained along the rail, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch then weakened. SHERIFF'S KID , swung out on the turn, was fanned to
the seven path when making a move turning for home and failed to sustain the run. FLYIN IT , no factor, swung to the seven path in mid stretch. MIKEY'S
JEWEL , angled in early, saved ground around the turn and retreated through the stretch. MAGIC ELECTION showed speed in the two path between
horses and faltered leaving the turn. KRUBERA , a forward factor three wide on the turn, drifted to the five path when challenging for the lead entering the
stretch then faltered. FILLMORE EAST was outrun.

Footnotes
STROLL SMOKIN dueled inside, gained a slim lead in mid stretch, edged away a bit inside the sixteenth marker and held firm under a drive. KARAN'S
NOTION , urged from the gate and gained a slim advantage, dueled outside the winner past the furlong grounds and stayed on well. CAREY TIMES rated
close up while racing towards the inside, eased out three wide into the lane, had aim and churned on. W W SPRINGTIME , off the early pace, dropped in
around the turn, stayed inside for the drive and had a mild rally. REFORM SCHOOL drafted back off the pace, saved ground leaving the far turn, angled five
wide making headway into the lane, straightened away but lacked a serious response. THE CAIRO KID , between foes near the half mile marker, stalked
the duel while outside a foe mid turn, shifted four wide into the drive and faded. XY SPEED , reluctant to load, raced three deep early and faded.
FRANK'SGUNISLOADED dwelt badly, walked out, was pulled up early and walked off.

SKI BUNNY , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up in three path on the far turn, bid for the lead entering the stretch
and drew out late. AWESOME PAL , two wide chasing the pace to the far turn, inherited the lead mid way on the bend, battled to the eighth pole and
continued willingly. ONE LAST TRIAL , lightly steadied in some traffic near the five eighths pole, ranged up four deep leaving the far turn then rallied mildly
while attempting to drift in. FAIRY WISH , two wide the far turn, offered a mild gain the stretch. TEQUILA FOG hugged the inner rail on both turns and
weakened in the stretch. ALWAYS A QUEEN , angled out leaving the first turn, moved up four wide on the far turn then gave way. ISABELLAALEXA , sent
to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, pulled up lame on the far turn and was vanned off.
