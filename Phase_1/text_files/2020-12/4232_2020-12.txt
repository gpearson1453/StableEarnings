Footnotes
MY WICKED WISH chased the early pace from the outside, dueled up the backstretch, remained forward through the second turn, responded entering the
drive, drifted out slightly mid stretch, dueled through the drive and was just in time. LEFT OF THE DIAL stalked the early pace from the inside, inched closer
up the backstretch, held a forward position for the drive, responded and was along for the place. VELVET NIGHT drifted out into the first turn, chased the
early pace from the outside, advanced through the second turn, responded and rallied late. PUMP IT chased the early pace inside, remained forward but
had nothing for the drive. BACK INTHAT ACTION broke sharp from the inside, gained a clear early margin, dueled up the backstretch then tired in the drive.
BLUE RIDGE MOON went evenly. CHIEF THE GREAT drifted out into the first turn and was no factor. BODE RAE forced out into the first turn and was no
threat. SIGNE forced the early pace and faded. ZEDUSIVE had a steady fade.

Footnotes
STORIED TRIP stalked the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn, dueled
through the second turn, gained a clear margin at the eighth pole and was well clear while kept to task. DUEPEG dueled from the outside early, battled up
the backstretch, remained forward but could not match strides. KODIAK SKY unhurried early from the outside, advanced through the second turn,
responded and closed with a rush for the show. OLD FASHION AMOUR dueled from the inside early, remained engaged up the backstretch but had nothing
for the drive. ONETWOMANYROCKETS was no factor. SILVER SIREN forced the early pace and tired. SWEET AMELIA chased the early pace and faded.
AMERICAN MOM was always outrun.
