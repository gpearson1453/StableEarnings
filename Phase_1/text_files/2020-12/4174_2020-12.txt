Footnotes
STERN led the way by a slim margin on the first turn, set a pressured pace down the backstretch, dueled for the lead racing inside of MINE REDEMPTION
around the far turn, got headed for the lead then dug back in gamely, battled on from the inside position, regained a slight edge and refused to let rival by.
MINE REDEMPTION applied pace pressure to STERN leaving the first turn and continued to force the issue down the backstretch, matched strides for the
lead going by the quarter pole, roused for more top of the lane, battled on along the outside of STERN through the final furlong, continued to put in a good
effort but could not get by game foe in final stages. ITSGOODTOBEKING was unhurried and raced off the early pace, shook the reins and headed in pursuit
with three furlongs left to run, gathered momentum entering top of the lane, drifted out wider and continued a steady to clear a share. KANDI SPUN raced
five wide entering the first turn then raced off the pace down the backstretch, hustled up around the far turn and into stretch run but lacked the needed
response for impact. MY BABYS GONE settled in range near the inside in early stages, launched a bid for the top pair three furlongs out, hustled along
three wide into stretch then gave way. ADELE'S BLING lunged at the start then was forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked through early stages
along the outside then had no response and weakened on the final turn. GRASS SNAKE was rank in the first turn then settled not far back early on but
came up empty after the half and dropped back.

turn and loomed a threat near the quarter pole, swung into action five to six wide entering top stretch, angled in a couple paths and roused forward under
steady pressure to wrest command from YOU SHOULD TALK in late stages then held firm. YOU SHOULD TALK advanced up the inside to challenge

got wore in the final sixteenth. WITH THE BAND raced in the second flight along the outside leaving the backstretch, launched a four wide bid near the

Footnotes
MISS OCEAN EXPRESS was well rated and settled off the pressured pace, launched a bid late on the turn, came under left handed pressure and shifted
out wider in upper stretch, gathered strong momentum along the outside and drove clear. STAYTHIRSTYMYAMIGO was away in good order and vied for
the lead through the backstretch, battled on racing two wide between foes past the quarter pole, hustled along into stretch, shook free to a slim lead,
continued to put in a good effort but could not hold off the late surging winner. ROYAL SOPRANO raced up close through early stages then advanced to
dueled four deep around the turn, could not move on with the leader in upper stretch but stayed on with response and secured a share. ALEX'S BOURBON
got bumped back at the start then settled early on to rate off the early speed, picked up the pace along the rail around the turn, sustained bid in upper
stretch then failed to sustain bid in the final furlong. MUCH ABOUT IT raced up close then advanced three wide to challenge for the lead leaving the
backstretch, battled on around the turn then had no kick left in the drive. MISS AGGIE BLING was away in good order and vied for the lead through the
backstretch, battled on racing inside of a trio around the turn, briefly held the advantage top of the lane then got headed and dropped back.

ABSAROKA grabbled the lead around the first turn and set the pace with VARNISHED applying some pressure, turned back bid from rival three furlongs
out, gained a clear advantage and remained comfortable on top in hand past the quarter pole, hustled up turning for home, had more left in reserve and
stayed clear under a driving finish. JUST ASK JOEL was allowed to settle out of the gate and stayed tucked in to save ground on the first turn, remained
unhurried while never too far back through early stages, headed in pursuit along the inside around the far turn, cut the corner and sustained a steady effort
through the lane. VARNISHED was forwardly placed racing just off the pacesetter to the far turn, launched a bid for eventual winner three furlongs out, could
not reach the lead but stayed on with response for a share. WILD TONIGHT raced inside a rival and stalked the top pair to the far turn then failed to move
on when called upon. FAMILIAR DREAM raced in range through early stages then failed to keep pace and faded upon entering the far turn. NIALL raced
three wide into the first turn then was not far back through early stages but could not keep pace entering the far turn and retreated.

aforementioned foe around the turn, was put to a drive turning for home, battled on racing outside of INSURRECTION, dug in gamely under steady pressure
and edged away in deep stretch. INSURRECTION set a pressured pace with SHIFTY HENRY sitting along the outside through early stages, vied for the
lead around the turn, stayed on gamely and battled back along the inside into the final sixteenth but could not hold off winner in deep stretch. TOTALLY
TIGER raced in contention and tracked the top flight flight going by the half mile marker, picked up the pace and headed in pursuit around the turn, could not
reach the top pair pair but sustained a good effort through the lane. DREAM BABY DREAM settled along the outside not too far back in early stages, was
ridden along three wide around the turn, sustained a four wide run into the lane but needed more for impact. A J SAMURAI was unhurried and raced in the
back, picked up the pace on the turn, hustled along five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. GEAUXCRO was off slow at the start then steadily
advanced into contention, continued in range to the turn then failed to move on when called upon. ROCKET POWER tracked the pace to the turn then failed

FORTY NINE MODEL was away in good order and held a slim lead in opening stages, continued on top while while racing under pressure from a duo
leaving the backstretch, held firm over rivals around the turn then roused for more turning for home, turned back the rail bid from LAY M OUT mid-stretch
and kept on determinedly. LAY M OUT was away last but was never far behind in opening stages, saved ground down the backstretch then cut the corner
and given cue turning for home, advanced up the rail to race in close contention of the leader but could not reach the winner and settled for second best.
SWEET MARY M was forwardly placed and raced just off the early pacesetter, launched a three wide bid for command around the turn, remained in
contention entering the lane and sustained a steady stretch bid but could not reach the top two finishers. SKAMANIA hustled along under steady pressure,
moved into stretch run four wide and lacked the needed response for impact. NAUTICAL GEM chased in close contention through the backstretch, ran on
two wide around the turn the gave way top of the lane.

steady effort for second best. GOSPEL DEWEY raced off the early speed then swung wide into upper stretch and finished with response for a share.

way. DEDE'S TRICK was ridden along through early stages, saved ground around the turn, tipped out three wide top of the lane and needed more for late
impact. SANDY CREST raced off the early speed, hustled along two to three wide into stretch run and lacked a needed rally. MYSTICAL MATILDA set a
