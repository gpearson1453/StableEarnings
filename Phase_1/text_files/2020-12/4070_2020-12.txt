Footnotes
EUSTACE dueled for the lead with TRUMP UM into and around the turn, drifted out a bit into the stretch, put away that rival in upper stretch then met the
rail bid from FOREIGN PROTOCOL and kicked away from that rival in deep stretch to win going away. FOREIGN PROTOCOL well placed along the inside,
challenged from the rail in upper stretch, raced on even terms to the eighth pole but failed to sustain momentum in the final sixteenth. HIDDEN PROMISE
trailed the field early, angled in on the turn, moved off the rail in the stretch, split foes with a sixteenth to go and gained the show. MISTER MCLEAN
steadied off the heels of TRUMP UM early, chased two wide to the stretch and lacked a bid. SATCHEL DE RITCHES stalked outside a rival then three wide
around the turn and could not rally. TRUMP UM had good early speed and came in some early, dueled for the lead from outside, drifted out into the lane,
lugged out in the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
HOT BOX took control quickly from inside, drifted out around the turn, kicked clear and powered away to the wire. BIG DUKE mid-pack in the early going,
traveled two wide then angled to the rail around the bend, cut the corner into the stretch, steered out past the three-sixteenths pole and bested the rest.
COPPER HALO tracked off the rail, drifted out around the turn, finished willingly from outside and gained the show. BEN WADE trailed early along the
inside, angled out into the lane and improved position. AUTISM ABILITY stumbled leaving the gate, settled off the pace inside, caught in tight quarters and
steadied at the three-eighths pole, went two wide into the stretch and could not rally. FALCONS FURY chased off the rail, two wide into the turn then moved
out four wide leaving the bend and weakened. A LITTLE BIT LUCKY tracked outside a rival, carried wide by COPPER HALO on the turn, angled inside that
rival entering the stretch, moved back out at the three-sixteenths pole but had little left. LUCKY ROCKET chased just off the leader while outside a rival,
went three wide into the turn, floated five wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LUXURY LINER stalked the pace up the backstretch, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, chased through the lane then summoned a late bid
and edged MALIBUE MISTRESS in the final strides. MALIBU MISTRESS up close outside the leader, headed rival at the three-eighths pole, dueled around
the turn and into the stretch, cleared briefly inside the eighth pole, led through the the final sixteenth but got caught in the closing moments. JOYMAKER
broke out and bumped rival, went three wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch, closed well and was gaining to the wire. SMOOTH RITHMS bumped
leaving the gate, sat off the pace along the inside, steadied when rival came over mid-stretch, went outside that foe and kept on for a minor award.
COMMAS SAVE LIVES set the pace early and angled inward, challenged by rival at the three-eighths, dueled to the eighth pole then weakened late. NOVA
STAR chased from the far outside then angled into the two path, stayed in that path around the turn, drifted to the inside in the stretch and flattened.
RIGHTEOUSLY settled off the pace inside, angled out into the stretch and lacked the necessary response. SWEET KAELA in range early, lugged out into
the lane and weakened. SOBER in range early outside a rival, carried wide by SWEET KAELA into the drive and had nothing left to offer. CUTE MAUI GIRL
traveled at the rear of the field, went four wide into the turn then angled into the two path and never made an impact.

vied with a pair of rivals into the turn, outpaced at the five-sixteenths pole, chased inside into the drive then stayed on through the final furlong but got edged

Footnotes
ACTING OUT dueled for the lead outside of SQUARE PEGGY, cleared rival in upper stretch and drew off through the late stages. HOTITUDE stalked the
pace from outside, loomed four wide into the stretch, could not match the winner in the lane but bested the others. NO COVER CHARGE stalked three wide
around the turn and got up for the show. SQUARE PEGGY had early speed then dueled for command inside of ACTING OUT, fought back into the drive
then lost contact in upper stretch and weakened. A MELIS came in and bumped rival then shifted in shortly after in the early stages, tracked four to five wide
around the turn and failed to threaten. JEWEL THIEF stalked along the inside, moved out a bit in the lane and weakened. MISS FRAULEIN hopped at the
start, trailed the field up the backstretch, angled to the inside, steered out in the stretch and never made an impact. ANDYOUSHALLRECEIVE bumped by
outside rival soon after the start, bothered again by that rival soon after and steadied momentarily, traveled two wide into the turn then three wide into the
stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
UNION DANCE dueled for the lead from outside, cleared rival at the three-eighths, met bid into the stretch then turned away AIR JOCKEY and widened
under hand urging. AIR JOCKEY chased outside the top pair, bid outside the leader and four wide into the stretch, proved no match in the drive but bested
the others. CHOSEN MOON chased off the inside, two wide then between rivals at the five-sixteenths, kept on through the lane and held the show.
SQUARED STRAIGHT raced between foes early then outside a rival on the turn while three wide, angled out into the lane and lacked a serious bid.
WESTERN SMOKE took the turn five wide and never rallied. LUCKENBACH tracked the pace from inside, moved out into the three path and had nothing
left when asked. MOBJACK dueled for command from inside, could not go on with the leader around the turn and faded. ASSET broke out, raced four wide
into the turn, angled to the three path then back four wide entering the stretch and never threatened. GONE AWOL had early speed from inside then chased
the top pair leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired.
