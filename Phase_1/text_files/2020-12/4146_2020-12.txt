Footnotes
RISK MODEL away in good order, asserted control, was rated in the path two carving out the pace, pulling a bit on the left, struck the three-sixteenths
marker and was given her cue, responded and scampered away. RAPIDO GATTA was allowed to drop back after prompting the winner during the opening
phases, departed the backstretch from path two, kept watch on RISK MODEL from midpack, was cued up angling to the outside for the drive home,
straightened away towards path four, proved no match, but had enough of a kick to get up for the place. BACK CHANNEL along the outside, travelled four
wide on the turn, came under the whip by midpoint on the turn, got sent out one path wider entering the stretch, missed out on second.
ICANCEECLEARLYNOW lost her footing springing from the starting gate, worked out a tuck into path three at the half mile pole, contently brought up the
back of the back, shifted towards the inside in upper stretch, got outfinished. STRINGS ATTACHED underwent a ground-saving journey, faltered.
MISSPOTOFGOLD steadied after lunging at the start, powered up to a forward position, pressed the issue outside the top one for much of the opening half,
got set down as the half was being competed, spun into the lane and retreated. All riders carried an additional two pounds in accordance with a
weather-related safely initiative.

VALLARAND chased along the inside down the backstretch, tipped to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five

into upper stretch, took over command straightened away, yielded the front inside the three-sixteenths and weakened. SHESADIRTYDANCER coaxed from

Footnotes
INVALUABLE tipped to the outside after springing from the starting gate, was confidently-ridden sparring with BEHIND THE COUCH for the opening half,
turned into the lane on near even terms with the nemesis, had already assumed control when switched over to stronger handling deep into the furlong
grounds, answered the call and kicked clear. SIRENIC pursued the pace two wide, was in the same one coming into the stretch, failed to keep pace, but
had enough of a response to secure second. SKY KITTEN forwardly placed three wide, stayed for the show. BEHIND THE COUCH steadied after the start,
advanced into a prominent position upon recovery, cut over to the inside route, raced as a team with the winner, succumbed to that opponent during the
early stages of the stretch run, steadily weakened afterwards. FAIR LASSIE strung out three to four wide on the turn, had no closing punch. QUIETUDE
brushed with HALAMA at the start, worked out a tuck into the two path by the conclusion of the backstretch, departed it from between rivals, came under a
ride heading home, had no rally. DASHI put to an abbreviated ride out of the start, took up position in midpack, travelled three wide on the turn, went into the
lane, failed to fire appreciably. HALAMA put the shoulder into her next stall neighbor after stumbling inward at the break, got guided over to the inside route
at the half mile pole, stepped into the stretch, came up empty. MISS CHARISMA quickly set up along the inside route, launched no bids. All riders carried an
additional two pounds in accordance with a weather-related safety initiative.

coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying up the inside to issue a challenge through the final furlong
taking narrow command just inside the sixteenth marker and shook away gamely in the last jumps to prevail. MISS JIMMY five paths off the inside in aim of
the leader, tucked three wide through the turn advancing to apply pressure through the turn patiently handled, spun three wide for home, got roused
straightened away, dug in under a drive battling on to the finish and was just up for the place honors. AWESOME DEBATE established the front and
showed the way in hand three paths off the inside, tucked to the two path through the turn and came under increasing pressure from the outside by the
aforementioned foe getting put to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside for home, dug in under challenge from flanking rivals and clung
to the lead until headed just inside the sixteenth pole, fought on to the wire. OK HONEY seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide
through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and floated out an additional two paths straightening away,
offered no response. SCREAMIN' BY six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths,
continued four wide into upper stretch and weakened. CATHY NAZ chased three then two wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and tired. NEW GIRL IN TOWN chased four wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from

BY GEORGE lightly hand urged out of the starting gate to secure a forward position, vied for command with a well held MOONSHININGBRIGHT out in the
two path, got let out a notch in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole and then still more after settling in upper stretch, offered up the desired response
and kicked clear. TOO BOSS cut over to the rail at the half mile pole, kept watch on the front runners a short distance up ahead, got called upon turning into
the stretch, proved no match. MOONSHININGBRIGHT remained stationed in the two path after the break, sparred with the winner, going about the task
rated along, went into the stretch, got shaken off, backed away steadily afterwards. MOMZA underwent a three wide pursuit, was ridden into the lane,
lacked the necessary response. INSPIRATION POINT chased the pace from path two, swung out four wide for the drive, made no impact. CORE set up on
the rail by the end of the backstretch, was already being asked to pick it up by the midway point of the turn, got fanned out five wide from upper to midlane,
had no gain. MOTION TO STRIKE two wide and between rivals on the turn, folded. All riders carried an additional two pounds in accordance with a
weather-related safety initiative.

CONTROL STAKE tucked into the two path prior to reaching the conclusion of the backstretch, tipped to the outside as the half was being completed,
wound up in path three soon afterwards, kicked into gear, emerging at the eighth pole as the new leader, came under aim from SQUARE SHOOTER, but in
dug in with good determination to prevail. SQUARE SHOOTER bumped solidly from between rivals in the shadow of the gate, departed the backstretch
from the three path, flashed some interest as the second split was being finalized, fanned out six wide from upper to midlane, closed in on the ones to catch,
tried to lasso the winner in the final stages, only to get denied by an opponent equal to the task at hand. MANIFEST DESTINY tracked the front runners
from along the inside route for the initial half, got sent out five wide after turning into the stretch, rallied for the show. PREAMBLE coaxed along keeping
within striking distance in the pocket, scurried into contention from upper to midstretch only to flatten out. HONORABLE SERVICE three to four wide in
pursuit of the front runners, was more the latter during the stretch run, mustered up a mild response. SHAMROCKED hand urged to establish the top, went
over to the inside, vied to maintain command, spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, was put to the test spinning into the lane, succumbed to heavy
pressure and steadily backed away. VINEYARD SOUND bumped into right after the start, assumed a forward position, sparred for command two to three
wide until the head of the stretch, folded. THE QUEENS JULES two wide onto the turn, was moved out four wide exiting it, had no response. FOX RED took
up the chase from path three on the turn, left the five-sixteenths pole under a brisk hand ride, shifted towards path five entering the turn, backed away.
KAMPAI stumbled inward, pilot losing his balance, proceeded to make solid contact with SQUARE SHOOTER, was spotted towards the inside by the top of
the turn, went into the stretch and ventured onward having trailed throughout. All riders carried an additional two pounds in accordance with a
weather-related safety initiative.

RUVIES IN TIME dueled briefly inside of ELOQUENT SPEAKER before backing off to track that rival in closest aim along the inside, remained patiently
handled through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch, got roused straightened away, scraped the paint coming to the eighth pole and seized command
at that station, drew clear under a drive to prevail. BANKERS DAUGHTER broke in at the start bumping FLUSH into KINKY SOX and in turn SNICKET,
chased four then three wide from just off the pace, got set down spinning three wide for home, dug in under a drive proving no match for the top one while
keeping on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. STEAL MY HEART bobbled at the start and was brushed by ANYDAYISHERDAY, who recovered
outwards from a stumble, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and improved position for the
show honors. HONEY MONEY coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch
and passed tired rivals. ELOQUENT SPEAKER dueled briefly from the three path with RUVIES IN TIME to her inside before shaking away through the turn
in the two path showing the way, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under challenge from flanking rivals and was collared just outside the
eighth pole, then weakened to the finish. SNICKET bumped askew at the start in a chain of bumps begun by BANKERS DAUGHTER who broke inwards,
chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. KINKY SOX got bumped between foes
at the start due to pressure from the outside, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung three to four wide for home and tired. INVESTMENT INVITE stumbled at the start, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled six wide for home and weakened. ANYDAYISHERDAY stumbled at the start recovering outwards into STEAL MY HEART, chased three wide down
the backstretch and then five wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide for home and made no impact.
LUNE LAKE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. FLUSH
got bumped between foes at the start due to pressure from the outside, chased five wide down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn,

BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON away alertly, glided over to the rail prior to reaching the end of the homestretch, carved out the pace, coaxed, and with the
second place finisher in attendance from the outside, ventured along under the same scenario setting split after split, was coming up to the three-sixteenths
pole when called upon for more, responded and drew off. MUSICAL HEART prompted the winner from path two, keeping pace until the end of the far turn,
was turned loose spinning into the stretch, got left behind, but did enough nonetheless to earn the second best designation. EMPTY TOMB pursued the top
twosome from the two path, came under encouragement as three-quarters was being completed, stepped into the lane, secured the show. MIRINAQUE
(ARG) tracked the pace from the pocket, was put to a drive approaching the three-eighths pole, fell back after the third fraction had been finalized, went into
the lane and backed away even nore. DANNY CALIFORNIA rode the rail, saw the pilot resort to a drive coming up the to the top of turn two, angled three
wide into the lane, made no headway. SO HIGH (GB) hung out three wide on the clubhouse bend, was in path two by the half mile pole, appeared through a
furlong down the road. All riders carried an additional two pounds in accordance with a weather-related safety initiative.

SEVEN LILIES bumped at the start by MR. PETE, who broke outwards, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide for home, dug in under a drive between foes and was brushed as DADDY
KNOWS came out a furlong from home, forged through to split foes dueling with THE CARETAKER inside the sixteenth pole and prevailed gamely on the
wire. THE CARETAKER chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
and was brushed by the aforementioned foe as DADDY KNOWS came out a furlong out, dueled with SEVEN LILIES to the finish and was denied on the
line. DADDY KNOWS forwardly placed five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, came out brushing SEVEN LILIES into THE CARETAKER a
furlong out, got collared near the sixteenth pole, then kept on to secure the show honors. DURKIN'S CALL chased four then three wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and improved position. JUST RIGHT chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, weakened in the late stages. VICAR'S LEGEND broke awkwardly at the start, chased just off the inside until
tucked inside half a mile from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. DARK MONEY dueled three then two wide with ALMENDRO
to his inside, took over sole command at the three-eighths, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, yielded command nearing the eighth pole and
weakened. KOSCIUSZKO chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired. MR. PETE broke out at
the start bumping SEVEN LILIES, chased two to three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired.
ALMENDRO dueled inside of DARK MONEY from the get go, got headed at the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into
upper stretch and tired. HIT IT ONCE MORE eight paths off the inside detached at the tail of the field in tandem with VICAR'S LEGEND, darted inside near
the half mile pole to be two to three wide through the turn, got put to coaxing at the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch, was under light
handling when bobbling heavily just outside the sixteenth pole, hobbled injured through to the finish the rider paused, then continued to gallop out a
sixteenth past the wire before losing the rider then jogged off to the midway point on the clubhouse turn in distress before being apprehended by the outrider
and was subsequently vanned off. GIO D'ORO forwardly placed just off the inside in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths along the inside,
spun just off the inside for home, got placed to a protective hold straightened away as the rider sensed something amiss, was expertly eased up before
being pulled up near the sixteenth pole, then walked off under his own power.
