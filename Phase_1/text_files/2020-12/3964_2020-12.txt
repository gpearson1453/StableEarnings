Footnotes
GOLDEN SMILES stalked the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, angled outside entering the drive, responded and wore down rivals
the final furlong. ORETTA pressed the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded when asked and closed with a rush for
the place. NINEONEONEPRAYER broke sharp from the outside, quickly gained the early margin, remained clear through the turn, continued to show the
way at the eighth pole but could not last. MISS UNDERRATED chased the early pace from the inside, remained forward, responded and was gaining late.
VIKING VOYAGE forced the early pace outside but had nothing left. SONG FOR HEDDINGS bobbled at the start and was no factor.
SIBERIANPRODUCTION was never close. HALF HEROINE was no menace. QUEEN SHASTA flashed early speed and gave way.

Footnotes
ENVOY'S GUILT up close early from the inside, inched closer up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn, responded to duel
through the drive and inched clear late. INSEPARABLE unhurried early from the outside, advanced through the second turn, responded when sat down for
the drive and closed with a rush for the place. MISS MABELEE dueled from the outside early, gained a clear margin up the backstretch, dueled with the
winner through the drive but could not keep pace. SWEET MILAGROS forced the early pace outside but came up empty in the drive. JOZZY BELL was no
factor. TWN PALMYSDESTINY forced the early pace outside but had nothing left. WIND ZEE was never a threat. G G HAS A SHOT chased the early pace
and tired. BULLETSANDBOURBON showed little.

margin at the eighth pole but could not last. AMANDAS LIGHTENING dueled from between foes early, remained engaged up the backstretch but could not
keep pace in the drive. READY REDDING forced the early pace outside, remained forward but just missed the show. BUBBA SMACK chased the early
pace outside, made a bid but was too late. DIT went evenly. WHITE TAIL DEER had a steady fade. UNBRIDLED PULPIT was never close.

Footnotes
I'LL RAISE YOU chased the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the second turn, responded to duel through the drive and was just up
the final strides. MUTINEER up close early from the outside, dueled through the second turn, remained engaged for the drive but was outfinished. BUCK
DUANE outrun early, advanced outside through the second turn, came six wide into the drive, responded and rallied late. GUILTY AGAIN well placed from
the inside, inched closer entering the second turn but could not keep pace in the drive. CANYON FIRE could only improve position. D'TUFF CAT REY broke
sharp from the outside, gained a clear early margin, remained clear up the backstretch then tired in the drive. SOUTHERNAIRE could only pass tired ones.
SUCH was no factor. LIAISON HALO was no threat. MALUSITA TOWER flashed early speed and faded. Due to a timer malfunction this race was hand
time.

LITTLESTITIOUS chased the early pace from the outside, dueled up the backstretch, shook loose entering the second turn, opened a clear margin at the
eighth pole and steadily drew clear. COLOR OF DAWN broke sharp from the inside, gained a clear early margin, dueled up the backstretch, remained
forward for the drive but was no match late while holding the place. XTREMA unhurried early from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch,
responded entering the drive and rallied but too late. MODIFIED went evenly. SHE LIKES TO PARTY forced the early pace from the inside, dueled up the
backstretch then faded in the drive. TAYLOR'S TOURIST was never a factor.
