ANNAMATED MOON leaving the gate, came out four wide midway on the turn while rallying and finished willingly outside. RING THE BELLA ducked out
into MARTINKELLY leaving the gate, wasn't far back along the rail and lacked the needed closing. INTERESTING LEGACY chased early, edged closer two
wide between horses on the turn then lacked a further response. ANNAMATED MOON was bumped leaving the gate, came out two wide nearing the
stretch and lacked a rally. METAPHORICAL was outrun. VICTORY ELEMENT chased three wide to the stretch then tired. LOXODROME reared in the gate
at the break then couldn't catch up.

STONE HEARTED sped clear soon after the break, stayed inside around the turn, ran out entering the stretch, was pressured throughout the lane and
prevailed after a long hard drive. SACRED MOUNTAIN chased the winner, moved outside that one on the turn, fell back entering the stretch, angled to the
rail, drew even in mid stretch but was outfinished. DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT moved to vie three wide on the turn, remained lapped on the winner to the end
but wasn't enough. A MAIZE ZING RIP was slow early then failed to menace with a late gain. POCOPSON STATION lacked a rally. QUICK ENOUGH
couldn't keep up.
