Footnotes
CHASING CARA broke out at the start brushing PINK GIN and forcing that rival to be taken in hand, came under coaxing to establish the front shortly after
the start and showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from TEETOTALER to the outside, came under increasing pressure from that rival
through the turn and widened away from the rest of the field in tandem, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in stubbornly fending off a pair through
the final furlong to prevail gamely by a neck on the wire. TEETOTALER pressed the pace three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive battling on latched on to the outside through to the finish but could not go by and was ultimately repelled to
the line in a good effort. STORMI CAT LADY five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced through the latter portion of
the turn and swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latching on the top pair inside the final furlong, shied out under a near sided stick
running on to the finish but was rebuffed to the end while well clear of the rest for the show honors. GALLINA chased along the inside down the backstretch
before tipping three wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide for home and passed tired rivals. QUIET TYPE
steadied at the start when HOME FOR CHRISTMAS broke outwards directly in front, chased six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went six
wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and improved position. ROSIES SURPRISE chased
three to four wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung four wide into upper stretch and
tired. SASSY MELISSA forwardly placed four wide, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, faded and continued four wide for home, then folded in
the stretch. HOME FOR CHRISTMAS broke out at the start forcing QUIET TYPE to be steadied in behind her, chased just off the inside just off the pace,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went two to three wide for home and faltered. PINK GIN got brushed at the start and steadied in behind CHASING
CARA, who broke outwards, grew detached at the tail of the field striding a bit green three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four to five
wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. FLIRTACIOUS KISS five
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, cornered two to three wide into
upper stretch, tired and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
ROSSA VELOCE broke in line with INFRINGEMENT, grabbed the advantage in short order and cut over to the inside route, carved out the pace
accompanied by the aforementioned rival parked out two wide herself, saw the runner up assume the role of primary pursuer approaching the
five-sixteenths pole, got turned loose coming into the stretch, fought on with good determination to prevail. SECRET LOVE away without apparent mishap,
secured the pocket slot, was patiently ridden tracking the front runners during the opening phases, deftly shoe-horned itself into the two path crossing the
midway point on the turn, drew abreast of the top one soon afterwards, got given her cue spinning into the stretch, vied with vigour, but couldn't go by. MISS
COMEDIAN sluggish on the backstretch, chased the pace from path two during the run around the bend, was spotted slightly closer to the rail for the stretch
run, got the show. CARAMOCHA reserved three wide for the initial half, commenced the stretch a path wider, lacked the necessary response.
INFRINGEMENT spotted in the two path after the start, contended for the top two wide until the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, stepped into the
lane and retreated.

Footnotes
OVERTOOK off the rail throughout, scurried into contention with a sustained two wide run on the bend, maintained that momentum fanning out
approximately six wide from upper to midlane, kicked into gear after completing the maneuver, rolled by the ones to catch inside the sixteenth marker and
kicked clear. GWAUN RIVER VALLEY tracked the front runners from just off the inside for nearly three-quarters, got sent out four wide early during the
stretch run, came home with willingness, but had to settle for second. NEPOTISM attained a prominent position, was in path two contending for the top, got
set down springing from the five-sixteenths pole now engaging with REPO ROCKS, fended that challenger only to begin the final furlong with fresher rivals
taking aim, succumbed to their pressure with about a sixteenth to go, weakened into the show slot. ASK NEAL kept watch on the front runners taking the
inside route for six furlongs, tipped into the two path at the top of the lane, made no headway. REPO ROCKS shifted into the three path proceeding along
the backstretch, crept up to NEPOTISM on the turn, put in his bid from the five-sixteenths pole to midlane before flattening out. BIRD RULER moved up
under his own power into midpack on the chute, was two wide stepping onto the turn and three wide exiting it, came up empty. FLEX eyed the pacesetter
towards the inside route, was under a brisk hand ride swinging to the outside entering the stretch, left the eighth pole in the neighborhood of path five,
lacked the needed response. RUGGED UNION guided over to the inside early on the backstretch, disputed the pace until the five-sixteenths pole, went into
the stretch and steadily backed away. OHYOUDIDNTKNOW strung out four wide on the turn, folded.

Footnotes
R WORKING GIRL remained forwardly placed after the start, sparred for command from path two, got put to the test by ONE GLAMOROUS GAL as the half
was being reeled, shifted over to the rail when asked for more in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, closing what had been an open rail for use by JUST
READ IT, staved off the challenger, emerged at the eighth pole leading by her largest margin, saw the runner up rallying dangerously from the middle of the
strip in the final stages, kept going on well enough long enough to preserve the decision. MARACUJA rode the rail for opening half, angled four wide into the
stretch, had a good finish down the center of the track, missed. ELEVATOR SHAFT off the rail, travelled three wide on the turn, got sent out into path five
from upper to midlane, rallied for the show. JUST READ IT forwardly placed along the inside route, cut the corner with room enough to launch a rally of her
own, scuttled those plans after the top one set up shop herself on the inside route, altered course into path two in the general area of the three-sixteenths
pole afterwards, flattened out in the last sixteenth. ONE GLAMOROUS GAL pressed the issue from path three, issued a bid coming up to the quarter pole,
kept at the task for the ensuing furlong then weakened. MY DELICIOUS settled into path two by the conclusion of the backstretch, came under a ride
coming up to the five-sixteenths pole, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, gained some, but all accomplished without any impact.
DESPEIGHT ALL ODDS shied in sharply from another as the field was sent on its way, rushed up in midpack under a brisk hand ride, was down along the
inside route keeping an eye on the front runners, cut the corner under some urging, gave way. LUTESCOOT N BOOGIE strung out three to four wide on the
bend, was more the latter for the stretch run, backed away. ABSOLUTE PRIVILEGE taken hold after breaking to the inside in an awkward manner, went
about the turn two to three wide, moved out towards path four entering the turn, then ventured onward after having nearly trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ZOOMER a bit fractious prior to the start, bobbled at the break and recovered to establish the front into the first turn, showed the way in hand along the
inside through moderate splits, remained patiently handled settled into a comfortable rhythm as rivals got busy in behind and abreast midway on the far turn,
cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat from PER CAPITA to the outside getting put in slightly tight along the rail a sixteenth out, came out
slightly and brushed with his main danger seventy yards from home while gamely rebuffing the challenge to the wire to prevail by a whisker. PER CAPITA
coaxed from the gate, attended the aforementioned foe to the outside in the two path, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
for home, dug in under a drive latched on through the length of the stretch coming in slightly and putting his main foe in tight a sixteenth out, then got
brushed seventy yards from home while fighting gamely to the finish but was ultimately denied on the line by the slimmest of margins. SOMEDAY JONES
was taken in hand briefly when spinning four wide into the first turn, quickly tucked inside through that bend before tracking the front from the two path down
the backstretch and through the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and offered up a mild kick to secure the show
honors well clear of the rest. LIMONITE got taken hold of briefly before going just off the inside into the first turn, chased three wide coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. KUMAR a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased three wide from just off the
pace, came under a ride at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide at the head of the stretch and tired. MALTHAEL hustled from the gate, raced
forwardly placed four wide through the opening bend, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and through the far turn placed to coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, cornered three wide for home and tired. ROAMING UNION got taken in hand briefly before going three wide through the first turn, chased
four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
RIFT VALLEY required some constraint from the pilot after going about a good portion of the journey on the chute appearing unsettled, departed the
backstretch from the two path, came up to the end of the bend, angled out five wide for running room during the early going of the stretch run, kicked in his
best, arriving at the eighth pole full of momentum, struck the front end in the final seventy yards and edged clear. KING ANGELO put to some
encouragement springing forth from the gate, rushed up to the front, saw the rider resort to rating tactics after having achieving the top, showed the way,
feeling some pressure from a pair out in paths two and three themselves for much of the opening half, left the three-eighths pole arguing one on one with
ERNIE BANKER, got turned loose for the stretch, relinquished with under a sixteenth remaining, managed to save second. ERNIE BANKER tucked into
path three after the field had been released, was the widest of a threesome contending for the top until midpoint on the turn, then went at it in a duel with the
runner up, swung into the lane, saw the winner take charge in deep stretch, missed out on second. TRUE PALACE pursued the pace three wide, got set
down prior to reaching the five-sixteenths maker, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, closed in steadily to earn the
last major check. NOT PHAR NOW two wide onto the turn, angled four wide exiting it, flattened out. NEURO lost his footing at the start, took up position in
midpack, got guided over to the inside at the top of the turn, cut the corner into the lane, lacked a solid closing punch. WHICHWAYTOMALIBU mostly two
wide, launched no bids. ME 'N SAP sighted in path two on the turn, had no rally. BLACK IRISH pocketed, gave way. AMERICAN PIPER pressed the pace
two wide from between foes for nearly a half and folded. WICKED KARMA towards path two at the top of the turn, was five wide at the top of the lane, was
never in it.

Footnotes
RYAN'S CAT remained forwardly placed after a quick beginning, was in hand disputing the pace matched up with ROCKIN JO for the opening half,
disposed of that foe as the second fraction was being finalized, proceeded to sail along on a loosely-contested advantage afterwards, settled in upper
stretch and was given his cue, responded and drew off smartly. MONEY IN THE BANK stalked the pace forwardly placed, was towards the two path
entering the turn, tipped out towards the third one for the drive, proved no match while finishing well ahead of all the rest with regards to place honors.
LATIN LOVE BUG reserved two wide during the initial stages, was worked into path six from upper to midstretch, straightened away and rallied for third.
CAUSE OF ACTION settled into midpack on the backstretch, was two to three wide in pursuit of the front runners, swung out four wide for the drive, made
no headway in the final furlong. DR. DEVERA'S WAY off the inside throughout, chased the pace three wide during the run around the bend, angled five
wide turning for home, had no closing punch. TRUEBELIEVE underwent a ground-saving journey, stepped into the lane, improved mildly during the first half
of the stretch drive before weakening. FRIED RICE KING three wide both onto and off of the turn, never made its presence felt. SCORESWHENHEWANTS
saved ground to no avail. BEACH FRONT maneuvered its way into two path by the conclusion of the backstretch, appeared rank entering the turn, got
steered in the direction of path four for entrance into the stretch, had no offering. LIGHT THE POSSE strung out three to four wide on the turn, failed to
menace. THORNY TALE kept watch on the pace from path three for nearly a half, shifted out six wide into the lane commencing to back away. ROCKIN JO
hustled from the gate to establish a prominent position, cut over to the rail, went at it with the winner until the shadow of the three-eighths pole, fell back
steadily the rest of the trip leading up to the end of the bend, got put to a protective hold spinning onto the head of the stretch and allowed to fade away, was
subsequently vanned off after crossing the wire.
