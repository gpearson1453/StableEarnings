Footnotes
GURL YOU FINE led the way briefly out of the gate then conceded position and remained in striking distance just off the top pair, advanced willingly when
called upon mid-way on the turn, took clear command entering top stretch and finished going away under steady urging. DIAL DISH was allowed to settle
out of the gate and raced off the early pace, launched a three wide bid for command near the quarter pole, continued a steady run through the lane and
secured second best. BLAME THE RED CAT vied for the lead with WHY GEORGIA through early stages, shook off rival while taking on GURL YOU FINE
near the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the eventual winner and steadily weakened in the drive. GRAYDAWN DAY was away awkwardly at the start,
raced in or near the rear and failed to make a bid. WHY GEORGIA vied for the lead racing inside of BLAME THE RED CAT down the backstretch then
came up tired and faded on the turn.

Footnotes
POMEROY HAZE was away in good order and applied pace pressure to the leader through the backstretch, edged up to challenge CATALE COAL MAN for
the lead with three-furlongs left to run, briefly held a slight advantage then took on the challenge from REBEL RUMBLE, vied for the lead into the stretch run,
dug in gamely under pressure, took back control and held firm. REBEL RUMBLE tugged a bit while rated in good position through early stages, inched up to
challenge for the lead mid-way around the turn, dueled with POMEROY HAZE entering top stretch then failed to match strides with a furlong left to run and
settled for second best. MIGHTY BUGSY was unhurried and settled near the back flight, picked up the pace along the outside on the turn, roused five to six
wide top of the lane and steadily edged up closer to take a share. HOODOO BROWN settled along the outside near mid-range through the backstretch,
hustled up around the turn then ran on four wide in stretch run but lacked the needed response for impact. A LA OMEGA was unhurried and raced in or near
the back, shifted out and hustled along leaving the turn and lacked a needed rally in the lane. RAPID IMPULSE raced i n tracking mode just off the top pair,
came under a ride around the turn but came up empty. CATALE COLE MAN set a pressured pace through the backstretch, got collared for the lead by the
eventual winner on the turn and had nothing left in reserve.

DIXIELAND CANDY was well rated and settled in range down the backstretch, angled out and picked up the pace nearing the quarter pole, took closer
order entering top stretch then took command under light-handling near the furlong marker and continued clear while confidently handled through the lane.
MATTEA raced three wide around the first turn then settled into stalking position just off the top pair, came under a ride with three furlongs left to run, came
out wider in stretch run and continued a steady effort under strong-handling for second best. WATERMELON KIZS was unhurried in opening stages and
continued in the back down the backstretch, briefly waited along the inside on the far turn then shifted out wider top stretch and stayed on with response to
capture a share. RIVER CHARMER rated off the top two flights through early stages, hustled up three wide around the bend, urged along five wide into
stretch but failed to muster a needed rally. FORT PETTICOAT applied pace pressure to the leader down the backstretch, edged up and vied for the lead
with SHEZALITTLEHAZY entering the far turn, continued to battle back into upper stretch then came up tired. SHEZALITTLEHAZEY set a pressured pace
down the backstretch, vied for the lead around the far turn then tired in the drive.

EUROCHIPPYGOLFER settled in contention while tracking top leaders near the inside, hustled up two wide around the turn, came under strong left-handed
encouragement and shifted out wider upper stretch then was set down for the drive, kicked in gear along the outside and swept by in final stages. TAP THE
DOT was away in good order and vied for the early lead racing inside of YANKEE INDIAN, continued to battle with rival around the turn, responded when
given cue entering top stretch and gained a slight advantage over YANKEE INDIAN , continued to battle on gamely, never gave up just got out-kicked when
the winner swept by late. YANKEE INDIAN matched strides for the lead racing outside of TAP THE DOT in opening stages, continued to duel for the top
spot around the turn, could not get by aforementioned rival but stayed on stubbornly to the end. EUROEXIT settled in the back through early stages,
launched a three wide bid mid-way around the turn, hustled along five wide in stretch run and needed more for serious impact. WINNERS LUCK was well
placed racing just off the top pair, sat poised to strike three wide at the three eighths pole, failed to kick on when called upon on the turn, steadied when the
winner shifted out upper stretch and faded. CANONIZE stalked the pace down the backstretch, failed to sustain bid along the rail; around the turn and
steadily faded.

OKIE NATIVE sped to the lead in opening stages and remained clear along the inside on the turn, shook the reins top of the lane, responded willingly and
pulled away. BEGGARTHYSTAR raced in range along the outside through early stages, hustled up racing three deep around the turn, was no match for the
clear winner but stayed on with response to clear second best. GOSPEL JOHN raced in tracking mode behind the leader through the backstretch, hustled
up between foes mid-way around the turn, continued a bid upper stretch then steadily weakened but ran on for a share. DEVIN raced in contention through
early stages, urged for response along the inside around the turn then failed to sustain bid and weakened in the lane. THRILLING TIME raced in the back
then hustled up five wide entering top stretch and lacked a needed rally.

OSO NEGRO raced just off the leader in opening stages then edged up and matched strides racing outside of CASCADE KING around the turn, came
under left handed encouragement top of the lane, responded, dug in to clear the advantage then stayed sharp under steady pressure. CASCADE KING
advanced after opening stages and vied for the lead racing outside of OSO NEGRO, could not match strides with the winner entering top stretch but stayed
on with response and held firm for place. WELCOME WEST raced four wide in close range through the early going, began to inch up closer along the
outside nearing the quarter pole, hustled up entering top stretch then ran on evenly through the lane. PAPA STAR raced off the top flight and chased rivals
around the turn, hustled up two wide near the quarter pole and failed to move on. FUNANDFUNNY raced off the pace, urged four to five wide entering top
stretch and lacked a needed rally. PRAIRIE NATIVE raced in the back then three wide into the stretch and failed to move into contention. KEETOOWAH

Footnotes
ALTERNATIVE SLEW was off slow at the start, angled inside and saved ground on the first turn, remained well reserved in the back of the pace down the
backstretch, shifted out and picked up the pace near the quarter pole, swung into action five wide entering top stretch, continued to gather momentum under
steady urging and swept by in the final sixteenth. TEXAS RAIN settled nicely stalking the pace down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid on the far
turn, advanced to challenge BREEZE RIDER for the lead top of the lane, dug in and moved by rival, stayed on with response but could not hold off the
surging winner. BREEZE RIDER sped to the early lead and set the pace down the backstretch, continued on top around the far turn, battled back when
challenged by TEXAS RAIN top of the lane then failed to keep pace past the furlong marker. DICEY was unhurried through early stages, picked up the pace
along the rail on the far turn, moved into closer contention then flattened out mid-stretch. COSMIC CODE stalked behind the leader through early stages,
launched a three wide bid for command on the far turn but failed to advance and faded in the lane. LADY LEX rated in range then hustled along three wide
on the far turn but failed to advance and faded. NO MAS TEQUILA settled not too far back early, came under a ride with three furlong left to run but had no
response.

EARNEDNEVERGIVEN was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved ground on the first turn, continued unhurried off the pace down the backstretch,
shifted out and launched a five wide bid nearing the quarter pole, swung into action six wide into the stretch run, rallied to the lead and finished going away.
TOWERING OAK raced in tracking mode off the top flight through early stages, hustled up two wide around the turn then stayed on four wide upper stretch
and continued a steady bid for second best. ONE SON OF A CHIEF vied for the lead in opening stages then took command and led the way in the
backstretch and around the far turn, got collared for the lead by eventual winner near the furlong grounds and weakened to show. PLUMBAGO was
reserved and raced well off the early pace down the backstretch then raced wide into stretch run, angled inside with a sixteenth left to run and showed
interest in final stages. CASH KITTEN was rated off the pace down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the far turn then failed to sustain run in
stretch and gave way. SOUTH TEXAS DRAWL was reserved then raced wide into the stretch and passed tiring foes. ANOTHRDAYATTHELAKE launched
a bid and edged closer four to five wide near the quarter pole but failed to sustain kick out of the far turn and dropped back. WAY OUT WEST settled near
mid-range, showed interest three wide on the far turn then raced wider into stretch run and failed to advnace. TRUSTWORTHY briefly matched strides for
the early lead, remained forwardly placed behind the leader down the backstretch then tired out of the far turn. ALBIREO saved ground along the rail on the
far turn and had no late run. CRAZY IVAN briefly matched strides for the early lead, remained forwardly placed don the backstretch then came up tired on
the far turn.
