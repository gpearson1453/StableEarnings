Footnotes
WEYBURN dueled from the four path with KENTUCKY KNIGHT to his inside, tucked to the two path through the turn, came under light coaxing nearing the
quarter pole before being set down spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, shook away from his main pace rival edging clear to the eighth pole, dug in
and held well to prevail. OFFICIATING broke in at the start bumping AL'S PRINCE lightly, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled out four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. COST AVERAGE six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through
the turn coming under coaxing midway, spun six wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. AL'S PRINCE leapt at the start and was
bumped by OFFICIATING, who broke inwards conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and offered no rally. KENTUCKY KNIGHT led early on from the three path before being engaged in a duel by
the eventual winner six furlongs from home, tucked inside half a mile out, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got let out swinging three wide into
upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off and weakened in the stretch. THRUSTER leapt at the start getting away last and conceding four lengths to the
front, chased along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. KING OF
DREAMS chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five wide
for home and tired.

Footnotes
FLAT AWESOME JENNY away without apparent mishap, was patiently ridden taking up the chase at or near the inside for much of the opening half, angled
five wide coming into the stretch, straightened away and readily closed the gap, wrested away the advantage in the general area of the sixteenth pole, had
already kicked well clear when geared down for the final forty yards. RUDE AWAKING pursued the pace from the three path, commenced the stretch one
farther off the rail, proved no match, but stayed on well to earn the place. COVER PHOTO powered up under her own power to confront CITIZEN MATZO
on the backstretch, was held in reserve pressing the issue from path two, snatched away control during the final stages of the run around the bend, settled
in upper stretch and was given its cue, relinquished a short distance from the eighth pole, then steadily weakened. AMERS at a considerable distance from
off the rail throughout, departed the backstretch from the four path, came under a ride a furlong later, fanned out into path six from upper to midlane,
venturing onward as the widest of all, gave way. ZECHA made it into the two path by the top of the turn, angled four wide for the drive home, never made
her presence felt. CITIZEN MATZO grabbed the advantage, was along the inside holding off COVER PHOTO, gave in to the opponent right around the
five-sixteenths pole even while being asked for more, went into the lane and retreated.

Footnotes
BROOKLYN STRONG away alertly, dropped back into a stalking role, chased the pace three wide until the quarter pole, got cued up spinning into the
stretch, clawed his way towards the one to catch during the ensuing furlong, appeared undeterred getting carried out a few paths by an errant TEN FOR
TEN in midstretch, that one's rider applying some left side stick work at the time, ground his way to the front end with gameness to get the job done. TEN
FOR TEN glided over into the two path with the advantage coming up to the end of the homestretch, rated well, showing the way on a loosely-contested
lead, continued along under the same scenario until the end of the second bend, felt the presence of the top one when finally called upon for more in the
vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, saw the winner become fully hitched up, came out after some left side shots at the eighth pole, taking BROOKLYN
STRONG along for an abbreviated ride, failed to intimidate that one, dug in with good determination but got reeled in. KNOWN AGENDA bumped with its
next stall neighbor after leaning in with his initial step, displayed no lasting ill effects and tucked along the inside route, kept watch on the second place
finisher loosely pocketed, failed to pick up interest when asked to on the backstretch, was maneuvered to the outside shortly after three-quarters had been
reeled off, fanned out wider and wider until in the neighborhood of path six by the start of the final furlong, proved no match while easily securing the show.
PICKIN' TIME made contact with KNOWN AGENDA in the shadow of the starting gate, went on to stalk the pace from the two path, swung out four wide
onto the head of the stretch, gave way. ERAWAN reserved for the opening six furlongs pursuing the leader towards the two path, came under a ride by the
five-sixteenths pole, angled three wide into the stretch, backed away.

along clear for the place honors. CHILLY CHOOS hustled from the gate, dueled inside of LA URBANA from the get go coming under coaxing at the

Footnotes
SHARP STARR remained forwardly placed after the field had been sent off and running, prompted PORTAL CREEK from the outside, going about the task
two to three wide on the turn, required some coaxing to keep pace after departing the backstretch, struck the five-sixteenths marker and was asked for
more, swung out approximately three wide stepping onto the top of the lane, chiseled away at the deficit, dueled away in the final furlong, finally wresting
away the advantage for good in the final forty yards. PORTAL CREEK established control in short order, shifted over to the inside route midway on the
backstretch, was held in reserve showing the way on a short leash, accompanied by the eventual winner from the outside, scooted along the right rim of the
inside route during the run around the bend, settled in upper stretch with the top one in hot pursuit and was given her cue, vied on with vigour, finally
relinquishing reluctantly well past the sixteenth pole. NONNA MADELINE tracked the pace while saving ground, went into the stretch, came out a bit
reacting to some left side pressure in midlane, proved no match. STAND FOR THE FLAG along the outside, was unhurried travelling three to four wide on
the turn, got steered out into the five path for the drive, venturing on as the widest, lacked the necessary response. GRACEFUL PRINCESS three wide onto
the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, backed away. OVERHEATED tucked into the two path by the conclusion of the backstretch,
eyed the front runners towards the rear of the pack, shifted into path three for the drive, failed to fire.

under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive under threat through the final eighth, clung to the lead drifting out

the finish and was subsequently vanned off. MRS. S coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside for home and offered up a mild kick. DOVEY LOVEY chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper

Footnotes
TIMELESS JOURNEY chased the pace at or close by the inside route for nearly three-quarters, swung out five wide entering the stretch, drew up to WASP,
got engaged in a spirited tussle with that one from the eighth pole onward and got the job done. WASP proceeded along the backstretch from off the rail in
midpack, advanced towards the front end as the second fraction was being finalized, followed DESBORDES by shifting over closer to the rail and into path
three at the top of the turn, was in hand assuming control late on the bend, settled in upper stretch and got asked for more, arrived at the furlong marker with
TIMELESS JOURNEY bearing down hard from the outside, went at it on even terms with that rival from that juncture onward, wound up the vanquished one.
IFIHADACHANCE sat within range two wide, commenced the stretch slightly wider, flattened out in the final furlong. AMOS along the outside, pursued the
pace three wide on the turn, got sent out six wide from upper to midlane, closed in to earn the final significant slice of the purse. COURAGEOUS GIRL cut
over to the inside, saved ground until the end of the bend, angled four wide into the stretch, made no late headway. BLITCHTON LADY forwardly placed
after breaking thus so, disputed the pace from path two on the turn, saw the second place finisher take over as three-quarters was being completed, hung
out as a prominent factor for an additional furlong before giving way. MY MY MICHELLE took up the chase primarily two wide, never made its presence felt.
PURE BODE three wide onto the turn, went into path four entering the stretch, failed to fire. DESBORDES disputed the pace towards the inside, was
through by the quarter pole. DANCING SLIPPERS settled at the back of the pack, was sighted stepping off the backstretch from path two, moved out five
wide heading home, wound up trailing nearly throughout.

MALATHAAT coaxed from the gate, tracked along the inside through the first turn in behind the leader, took to the two path down the backstretch coming
under light intermittent coaxing, tucked back inside into the far turn and got brushed by CAFE SOCIETY tucking in from the outside as MALIBU CURL
tucked in front with seven-sixteenths to run, came under a near sided stick twice through the latter portion of the turn put to coaxing, angled out five wide
into upper stretch nudging CAFE SOCIETY aside straightened away, rallied to steadily whittle down the leader's margin and was up in the final jumps to the
finish. MILLEFEUILLE just off the inside through the first turn, settled three paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, advanced
on that rival to take narrow command just inside the nine-sixteenths, tucked to the two path into the turn before clearing the prior leader to take over the rail
three furlongs from home, slipped away in hand through the latter portion of the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused straightened
away, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and was nailed in the final strides while clear of the rest. MALIBU CURL coaxed
from the gate, raced three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide down the backstretch and into the far turn before tucking to the two path
three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while safe for the
show honors. CAFE SOCIETY just off the inside through the first turn, gave chase three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide
into the turn before tucking to the two path and was taken briefly in hand when brushing MALATHAAT to her inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out at the quarter pole five wide and was nudged to the six path by MALATHAAT straightened away, dug in and
weakened in the final furlong. TRAFFIC LANE hustled from the gate, established the front crossing to show the way along the inside through the first turn
before taking to the two path down the backstretch, remained patiently handled and had MILLEFEUILLE advance near the nine-sixteenths, got headed for
command and was given some rein tucking inside into the far turn, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths now sitting a loose pocket behind the
leader, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. CELESTIAL CHEETAH just off the inside through the opening bend, chased three then two wide
coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
TRUE TIMBER away in good order, assumed a forward position, rated well keeping watch on the front runners, stepped onto the turn from path four, was in
hand chopping away at the deficit all throughout the run around the bend, had already inhaled a feverishly-ridden MR. BUFF a few jumps shy of the quarter
pole when called upon himself coming onto the top of the lane, offered up the desired response and kicked well clear. SNAPPER SINCLAIR took up the
chase from the two path after losing his footing springing from the starting gate, loosely drafted behind pacesetter MR. BUFF after entering the turn, got set
down in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths marker, angled five wide for the drive home, teamed up with PERFORMER as they futilely chased the winner,
bested the former for second. PERFORMER took the inside route for the opening half, was maneuvered to the outside after arriving at the top of the turn,
finished off the move towards path four a furlong down the road, got cued up for the drive home, fanned out into path six for room, joined up with the second
place finisher soon afterwards, vied alongside that foe thereafter, fell short of snagging away the place. KING GUILLERMO pressed the pace from path
three for almost three-quarters, folded. MR. BUFF hand urged early on the chute to establish a forward presence, tucked into the two path, showed the way,
coaxed and with KING GUILLERMO in accompaniment out in the two path, yielded despite being roused leaving the five-sixteenths when put to the test by
TRUE TIMBER, stepped into the stretch and steadily backed away. BON RAISON took up the chase three wide on the turn, altered over to the rail in time to
cut the corner into the lane under a drive, faltered.
