MASTERDANCER settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, rallied three wide to take the lead approaching the
quarter pole, widened on the turn and was steadily handled to maintain. THREE AFFAIRS stalked the earlier pace two deep then picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path but had to settle for second best. CELIA'S PRIDE saved ground off the early pace then
picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn then flattened stride a distant third. SAMMIE GIRL rated the pace
inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, was caught toward the quarter and weakened. MEGS SQUIRELLYGIRL settled off the pace
and off the rail the first turn, bid mildly approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little further. LIL PERFECT broke a
step slow and raced in the five path the first turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but was ultimately outrun.

LADY LICIOUS exchanged contact with Dereka's Bluff leaving the gate, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced three wide on the turn, was carried to
the four path into the lane, but dug in under steady encouragement to get up at the wire. SIENTE LA MAGIA broke outward then took over inside nearing
the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear midway on the turn, dug in to steady encouragement past the eighth pole but was nipped at the wire. WINDSOR'S
CHAMPION was bumped outward and into Dereka's Bluff at the start then set the pace most of the opening quarter mile, gave chase from the five
sixteenths and raced close to mid turn, dropped back in the three path approaching the top of the lane and flattened. CLUBIN TILL DAWN was forced
outward and into Windsor's Champion leaving the gate then gave chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail, though flattened stride inside the eighth pole.
DEREKA'S BLUFF exchanged contact with Lady Licious leaving the gate and was bumped shortly afterward, picked up the chase through the backstretch,
raced in the three path of the turn and showed little more. CALLING INDIA gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the six path.

Footnotes
WINNING SCHOLAR rated off the pace inside the opening turn then eased out with a bid from the three eighths pole, swept to the lead three wide past the
quarter pole, dug in under steady encouragement through the upper stretch but was taken in hand late yards. CASTLES TRICK eased out through the first
turn and raced well off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase from the half mile pole but checked off the heels of Orileys Typhoon in the vicinity of the
five sixteenths pole, recovered stride into the turn, angled to the five path toward the head of the lane and steadily closed to take second later yards. RAVIN'
MAVEN saved ground the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn, then ceded second later yards.
TAMAQUA settled off the pace in the two and three paths and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn about the six path then flattened stride the final sixteenth. SALERNO set the early pace inside, was caught toward the three eighths
pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back into the far turn, raced at the rail through the turn and showed little more. FIBERTOWN angled in to
stalk the early pace, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead toward the three eighths, but was caught into the far turn and flattened
stride. DIXIE'S CROSSING raced in the five path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but flattened stride about the six path
of the far turn. ORILEYS TYPHOON rated just off the early pace while saving ground, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but checked off the inside
flank of Dixie's Crossing past the five sixteenths pole and weakened on the far turn. ZEHAVI rounded the opening turn about the five path and showed little
response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
BUCKED TOOTH chased the pace and raced near the rail on the turn, angled three wide leaving the eighth pole, dueled to the lead later yards and dug in
determinedly to best the game efforts of JAXBRADENRISHI, who rated close inside while hemmed in most of the backstretch, bid into the turn, angled four
wide nearing the head of the lane and dug in gamely to the finish. ZALZA gave distant early chase and rounded the turn off the rail, lost momentum through
the upper stretch, recovered stride inside the sixteenth pole and finished well at the outside girth of Jaxbradenrishi. WIZARD OF ODDS pressured the pace
through the backstretch, took the lead two deep midway on the turn but was caught flattening stride later yards. ICE KAUFY gave chase through the
backstretch, raced in the six path of the turn and finished well; outside. ROLLING BROOK was hustled along to set a pressured early pace, gave up the lead
at the rail midway on the turn, remained close through the upper stretch but weakened the final sixteenth. THAT'S HISTORY became a bit fractious in the
gate and broke through prior the start, chased the pace, raced in the four path most of the turn, was forced to the five path nearing the head of the lane and
flattened inside the sixteenth pole. GABBI'S AMOR gave chase, rounded the turn about the seven path and showed little in the lane.

Footnotes
PIMM AND PROPER raced well off the early pace in the five path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, picked up the chase approaching the
seven sixteenths pole and steadily progressed from that point, rounded the far turn in the four path then dug in to take over later yards and raced clear
nearing the wire. AFANDI tapered to the inside to rate a slim lead, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and was met at even terms nearest
the rail midway on the far turn, was caught in later yards but dug in under determined handling to best the game effort of MIDNIGHT BANKER, who
stumbled from the gate then stalked the pace, challenged nearing the five sixteenths pole and dueled to even terms two deep midway on the far turn, then
dug in gamely to the finish, while grudgingly ceding second. GYPSY GIRL rated off the pace inside the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and
came through the far turn at the rail, then raced evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. MAJORIE MUGS was shuffled at the start and raced well back
from early contention, bid past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and finished evenly. RAINBOW RIVER saved ground off the pace, bid
leaving the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then finished evenly. THANK YOU GIRL rounded the opening turn in the three path
and settled close into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole then weakened in the three path of the far turn. WILD CAPPUCINO stalked
the pace three wide the first turn then gave chase into the backstretch, though, weakened in the five path of the far turn. TRINNI SUNSET saved ground
well off the early pace then eased out into the backstretch, bid only mildly and faded in the six path of the far turn. ROARING SIDECAR rounded the
opening turn about the four path, showed little response through the backstretch and raced wide on the far turn.
