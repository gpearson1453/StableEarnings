Footnotes
GOLDEN GODDESS dueled inside of SHENANDOAH STAR through the backstretch and into the turn, shook free late in the turn as rival started drifting
out, stayed along the inside in the stretch and held safely. SHENANDOAH STAR came out and bumped THICK SMOKE at the start, quickly recovered and
dueled outside of GOLDEND GODDESS through the backstretch, continued dueling into the turn, had some trouble taking the turn as rider had to pull hard
to keep horse from drifting out into the stretch, kept on gamely in the stretch while a clear second best. SOMETHING CHATTER stalked dueling rivals along
the inside, stayed along the inside through the backstretch and into the turn, stayed along the inside on the stretch, eased out late when making good
ground and galloped out well. THICK SMOKE bumped both sides at the start, lost many lengths to the pacesetters and stayed along the inside throughout,
kept on in the stretch while lacking a menacing rally. MIRA LOMA MADAM came in and bumped THICK SMOKE hard at the start, quickly lost contact with
top three on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and lacked needed response thereafter.
