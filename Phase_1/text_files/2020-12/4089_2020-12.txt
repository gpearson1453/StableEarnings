LUNA FORTIS stalked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, took over command down the lane and drew clear late under a steady drive. KYNANCE
(IRE) dueled early on, inched clear near the quarter pole, was in the four path into the lane, came out and bothered FROND twice down the lane and held
place in the final stages. FROND raced back early on, rallied along the far turn, was in the six path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but was bothered
by KYNANCE twice and did not have enough for place in the final stages. MOONLIGHT RAIN was unhurried early on, raced in the three path into the lane,
rallied in the upper stretch, made a bid but weakened late in the drive. NO MO TEMPER chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane while
making a bid but flattened out late in the stretch run. FINAL CUT was never a threat. CLOUD CHARMER dueled early on, was on the inside into the lane
and faded late in the stretch drive. SEA DREAM (BRZ) broke very awkward and was no factor. JULIA'S READY had early speed then folded up. HEAD ON
