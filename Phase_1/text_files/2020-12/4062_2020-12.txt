Footnotes
MAMA KIN broke in at the start bumping RAPIDO GATTA, as that rival recovered from a stumble, chased two then three wide down the backstretch before
tipping four wide through the turn advancing to latch on the top pair three furlongs from home, swung six wide into upper stretch and came inwards to the
five path straightened away before coming in to bump BASTET near the three-sixteenths, came in uncorrected once more bumping BASTET into BOOM
BOOM GIRL just before taking command a furlong from home, dug in under threat now switched to the near side stick corrected and lasted on the wire.
BARISTA VIXEN three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the place
honors missing at the end. BASTET knocked heads briefly with BOOM BOOM GIRL before easing of to chase in closest aim just off the inside, tipped three
wide through the turn advancing to apply pressure to that leader coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths between rivals as the eventual winner perched
to the outside, swung five wide for home and straightened away four wide into upper stretch, got bumped by MAMA KIN coming inwards at the
three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive heads apart and was bumped solidly a furlong out as MAMA KIN came in once more and in turn bumped BOOM
BOOM GIRL to her inside, fought on to the finish and was along for the show honors on the wire. BOOM BOOM GIRL dueled briefly with BASTET before
shaking away to show the way in hand just off the inside, came under pressure through the turn from a pair and was placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive getting bumped by BASTET due to pressure from MAMA KIN a furlong out and kept on through to the finish.
WISHES AND DREAMS coaxed from the gate, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, closed ground in
the late stages but was outkicked. CHEROKEE SONG broke in at the start, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, swung three wide
for home and weakened. RAPIDO GATTA stumbled badly at the start and was bumped by MAMA KIN, who broke inwards, recovered conceding four to five
lengths to the front, chased four then five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.
ZERENIA bobbled at the break and came under hustling, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper
stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
BARDOLINO away without apparent mishap, vied for the top from path two, cleared over to the rail midpoint on the turn, led the competition into the stretch,
got switched over to stronger handling in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, responded and kicked well clear. VODKA LEMONADE a forward factor
from along the inside, reacted to the firm hold being applied by the pilot by pulling on the bit during the initial stages, gained some cover once the winner
crossed onto the inside route right around the three-eighths pole, stepped into the lane, inched his way into a clear two path at the three-sixteenths pole, got
held at bay but saved second. DANZIGWITHTHESTARS stalked the pacesetter from along the outside, went about the task from the two path on the turn,
was set down for the drive, shifted towards the three path attempting to rally a sixteenth later, had to settle for the show after being outkicked. MARTINEZ
took up the chase from path two on the turn, got sent out into path six from upper to midlane, mustered up a mild kick for the final furlong. MR HOT
CHACHA rode the rail after making solid contact with ON OUR WAY BOYZ in the shadow of the starting gate, stayed put for the opening half, angled three
wide into the stretch, weakened. BEATTHATFLEW two wide onto the turn, was maneuvered into path six exiting it, lacked the necessary response. ON
OUR WAY BOYZ bumped at the start, took the inside route for the initial half, swung out five wide into the lane, made no headway. SONIC SPEED tucked
into the two path on the backstretch, was still there pursuing the front runners on the turn, came under rousing springing from the five-sixteenths marker,
commenced the stretch from path four, gave way. SWINGING STICKS tracked the front runners saving ground towards the back of the pack, got steered
out five wide for the drive, had no offering. MAMBONICK guided onto the inside route after the field had been released, tipped out three wide stepping onto
the head of the stretch, failed to menace. R BOY LITTLE EDDIE departed the backstretch stationed on the rail, went three wide into the stretch then
galloped onward.

CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE tracked the pace just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, remained patiently handled through the turn and
took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied under her own power to take command just inside the three-sixteenths, edged clear under brief urging near
the sixteenth marker and prevailed comfortably on the wire. BIG BENNYS TRIBUTE five paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the
leader applying some pressure through her presence only, tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over narrow
command spinning three wide for home, dug in under a drive and was displaced inside the three-sixteenths, ran on to chase the winner home.
CHAYSENBRYN six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, cornered four wide into
upper stretch and improved position for the show honors. BEHIND THE COUCH broke out at the start brushing MAKE OR BREAK, showed the way in hand
three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home displaced from command, weakened in the late stages.
MAKE OR BREAK got brushed at the start by BEHIND THE COUCH, who broke outwards, chased six then five wide under coaxing from the

Footnotes
MISS MI MI secured a prominent position along the backstretch, sat perched three wide during the run around the bend, keeping an eye on the front
runners, flashed interest a short distance from the quarter pole, maintained her momentum swinging into the stretch, got cued up in the general area of the
three-sixteenths pole, closed in relentlessly, stealing away the verdict in the last few jumps. RUDE AWAKING was on hold sparring for command two wide,
wrested away at the advantage as the half was being completed, was traversing through the furlong grounds when called upon for more, saw the top whittle
away at the deficit, dug in with good determination but got nailed nevertheless. FAIR REGIS bumped with MOVIE SCORE after coming in at the start, took
up position in midpack, travelled three to four wide on the turn, was more the latter heading home, put together a stretch response sufficient enough to
secure the show. COVER PHOTO rapidly placed on the rail, rode it for nearly a half, angled three wide into the stretch, narrowed in to earn the final
significant slice of the purse. ATHWAAQ forwardly placed in the two path while under a snug hold on the backstretch, shifted onto the inside route for the
trip around the turn, was more in path two for the drive, lacked the necessary response. MOVIE SCORE squeezed right after the start, got guided over to
the rail, failed to make her presence felt off the ground-saving journey that followed. DIRTY BIRD two wide onto the turn, got sent out four wide exiting it,
had no offering. HARDSTONEMELODY disputed the pace from along the inside for a half, faltered.

Footnotes
MENDHAM tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, remained patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, tipped out to the
two path straightened away, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong collaring the leader near the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the

upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. CAUMSETT established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, got set down taking the
inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive safe to the eighth pole, got collared near the sixteenth pole and ran on to preserve the show honors.

Footnotes
AMERICAN POWER broke on top, cemented himself to the lead with a light hand ride on the chute, cut over to the inside route, showed the way pressed by
the DR BLARNEY from the outside, had its coupled stablemate add himself to the pace scenario on the turn, was put to a drive for the drive home, staved
off all comers and edged away. MIHOS off the inside throughout, was urged along pursuing the front runners four wide on the turn, swung from the same
path into the lane, proved no match rallying for the place. LIL COMMISSIONER bumped with CELTIC CHAOS after coming out at the start, set up residence
in the three path, pressed the issue as the outermost of a trio during the run around the bend, bid into the lane, wasn't up to the task at hand, flattened out,
losing out on second. CELTIC CHAOS bumped with LIL COMMISSIONER shortly the start, chased the pace from the back of the pack on the backstretch,
got guided over to the rail at the half mile pole, stayed put, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, mustered up a mild response. HOME BASE
two lengths the tardiest after stumbling badly at the break, underwent a two wide journey, came into the stretch and gave way. DR BLARNEY prompted the
pace from path two, going about the chore from between rivals on the turn, went into the stretch and backed away. TALE OF SILENCE tracked the front
runners from along the inside route until the end of the bend, under some hand encouragement for much of the journey leading up to that point, got steered
out three wide into the stretch, had no offering.

Footnotes
JACK THE CAT broke a half a beat slow, tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and swung three
wide into upper stretch, rallied in behind a wall of rivals and tipped out to the five or six path a furlong from home just after SOULMATE cleared to the
outside, offered up a good finish to close in and get up in the final jumps over a host of rivals in a blanket finish. SOULMATE three wide in pursuit from just
off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong
knocking heads for command through the final sixteenth and battled on to the wire to just get the bob for the place honors. GOOD OLD BOY broke in at the
start and was corrected, tracked the pace along the inside in range of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper
stretch, rallied bumping VIP NATION a furlong out when seizing narrow command, got bumped by that rival just inside that station, fought on clinging to the
front until the final jumps and was along by a whisker for the show honors. CREATIVE PLAN two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenth, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to threaten through the final furlong running on to the finish but was outfinished in the last strides.
SO HIGH (GB) three wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled in to cut the corner into upper stretch, rallied up
the inside with some aid from the infield chute to issue a challenge inside the final eighth but was outkicked. GHOST GIANT tracked the pace from just off
the inside in mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish but was
outkicked. ATTENTIVE just off the inside in mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid
and was outkicked to the finish. HAYABUSA ONE (FR) broke out at the start bumping HIT IT ONCE MORE, settled just off the inside in pursuit from near
the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and improved position. RAPT saved ground
near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a bid but made no headway.
NUTZFORBOLTZ three to four wide near the rear, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. VIP NATION showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside at that station, dug in
under threat from a host of rivals, got bumped near the eighth pole and displaced from the front, came out and bumped that rival inside that station and
weakened in the late stages. HIT IT ONCE MORE got bumped at the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for
home and weakened.

Footnotes
FED FUNDS got checked lunging to the outside with his initial step, narrowly avoiding contact with its next stall neighbor, contently tracked the pace towards
the back while taking the inside route, cut the corner into the lane, gained ground on the front runners, kicked into his best at the beginning of the final
furlong and gained ground more readily, wore down the leader in the last few jumps and edged away. FOOLISH GHOST established the top in short order,
was moved onto the inside route, sailed along while being rated on a loosely-contested advantage, was asked for more turning into the stretch, with a
revved-up wall of equines attempting to close the gap, began to gradually drift to the outside, got nailed with a few strides to spare before the finish line.
BUSTIN SHOUT pursued the pace four wide from between rivals on the turn, was under a ride spinning one path farther off the rail into the stretch, finished
with some willingness to earn the show award. MORNING BREEZ chased the pace three wide from the middle of rivals during the run around the bend,
went into the lane, needed the needed late response. THE SICARII brushed in the shadow of the starting gate, travelled two wide on the turn, angled
towards path four for the drive, made no headway. MONEY RIDE pinched right after the start, departed the backstretch from path three, fanned out seven
wide from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, rallied mildlly. MORE GRAYTFUL sighted pulling with some force on the backstretch, was
stacked five wide on the turn, went into the stretch slightly wider, folded. CHARLIE MCCOY stalked the pact from path two, gave out in the last eight.
SPEIGHTFUL KITTEN saved ground to no avail. AHEAD OF PLAN brushed shortly after the start, raced three wide on the turn, was already under the whip
by midpoint, tipped out four wide stepping onto the head of the stretch, tired.

Footnotes
VIOLENTIAM bumped at the start by CAPTIVATING CARA who broke inwards, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until roused
cutting the corner into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish. NEBO chased just off the inside in
closest pursuit of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive shying out from a near
sided stick a furlong from home, ran on willingly to cut into the winner's margin in the late stages. DELAWARE DESTINY veered out at the start forcing
ADIRONDACK QUEEN and TREMAYNE to be steadied off her heels, chased three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and kept on to secure the show honors well clear of the rest. CAPTIVATING CARA broke in striking the near side stall before bumping with
VIOLENTIAM, then got bumped by MADAME ROSE who broke inwards from the outside, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off
the inside through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and improved position. EMPIRES FIRST LADY four to
five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and passed tired rivals. RED PRIESTESS chased two to three wide from mid pack, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, continued two to
three wide into upper stretch and weakened. REGAL HONOR brushed the near side stall at the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch and tired. TREMAYNE broke in at the start and was steadied hard off the heels of DELAWARE
DESTINY, who veered out, and conceded five lengths to the front, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered five wide for
home and tired. AZOGAR chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and faltered. ADIRONDACK
QUEEN steadied at the start when DELAWARE DESTINY veered out and conceded three lengths to the front, chased three wide under a ride from the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired. MADAME ROSE broke in at the start bumping CAPTIVATING CARA, chased two to three wide under a
ride from three furlongs out, angled five wide for home and tired.
