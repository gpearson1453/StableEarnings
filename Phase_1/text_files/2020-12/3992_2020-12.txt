Footnotes
MISS DRACARYS away without apparent mishap, got set up along the inside route prior to departing the backstretch, tracked the pace, fourth in line along
it, cut the corner into the lane, crept up towards the ones to catch, lacking optimal racing clearance all the while, inched its way into the two path and into
clearance in midstretch, closed the gap, split rivals a sixteenth later on the cusp of assuming the top, quickly struck the front and kicked away. STUCK ON
KITTEN settled in midpack, sneaked her way over to the rail coming up to the half mile pole, rode it until the end of the bend, angled four wide turning into
the stretch, finished with willingness to procure the place. O'GOTTEN GIRL cut over to the inside after establishing the top, showed the way, rated and while
being attended by an equally-rated PALACE GOSSIP from the outside, had the rival move up as the half was being completed, got turned loose for the
stretch drive, came under heavy pressure after the run through the furlong grounds ended, yielded a sixteenth down the road, saved the show. PALACE
GOSSIP was in hand pressing the issue from the two path, got roused for the drive home, failed to claim the top, weakened in the final sixteenth. GABBY
SQUARED took up the chase saving ground during the initial stages, slipped out into the two path crossing the midway point of the turn, commenced the
stretch one path farther off the rail, narrowed in however non-menacingly. WHY SHE DEW DAT pursued the pace two to three wide on the turn, swung out
into path five for the drive home, had no punch. SINGE in range two wide, moved out three wide into the lane, gave way. LILLY SIMONE pocketed, was on
hold waiting behind others approaching the quarter pole, tipped into the two path at the three-sixteenths marker, lacked a response. I'M A HUGGER strung
out two to three wide on the bend, was never in it.

Footnotes
WINTERS BACK established the front and showed the way under rating just off the inside until tucked inside three furlongs from home, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, drew off under a drive, dug in and held well to prevail. BRAY brushed at the
start by TURBO DRIVE who recovered outwards from a bobble, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside for home and kicked on belatedly to be along safe for the place honors while unable to threaten the winner. TURBO DRIVE bobbled at the break
and recovered outwards brushing with BRAY, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
ran on to secure the show honors in a blanket finish behind the top pair. SCANNO tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
angled three to four wide for home and offered up a mild bid. MICROSECOND three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. IL PRIMO SOLE (GB) three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along with
five-sixteenths remaining, went three wide for home and offered no response.

Footnotes
SNEAKINESS stalked the pacesetter without making his presence felt, got turned loose for the drive home, took charge during the ensuing furlong, came
under aim by the runner up in the final stages, held on well enough long enough to hold sway. JAKE ROCKS sat forwardly placed along the inside route,
tipped towards the two path for the stretch run, flashed some belated energy, came up short. THERISASTORMBREWIN pursued the pace three wide on the
turn, was slightly closer to the rail for the stretch run, got outfinished. TIZ KAZ NOW sent over to the rail at the top of the turn, angled four wide into the
stretch, mustered up a mild response to claim the last major check. MR PHIL off the inside, was hung out four wide on the turn, got put to a ride turning into
the stretch, had no punch. AMISTAD taken hold after lunging to the outside at the start, was quickly spotted along the rail, took it for nearly a half, got swung
out five wide entering the stretch, made no impact. SHADOW CASTER two wide stepping onto the turn, was fanned out six wide exiting it, made no
headway. INK SPLOTZ showed the way from the inside on a loosely-contested advantage, gave out once pressure arrived on the scene in upper stretch.
STANHOPE kept watch on the front runners in midpack two wide, was about as wide spinning into the stretch, gave way.

A LIFE THAT'S GOOD three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, rallied to
take command a furlong out, then drew clear to the finish to prevail. BUSTINMYGROOVE four then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got coaxed
along at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. COFFEE BAR
four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and kept on for the show honors. HIP NUMBER ONE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside pulling on the bit and
rating unkindly, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
IT'S A GAMBLE cut over to the rail, loped along during the journey leading up to the conclusion of the backstretch, was switched over to a hand ride, not of
the vigorous variety however, springing from the half mile pole, angled into path five from upper to midstretch to gain the necessary clearance, motored
down the center of the course to take charge in the final forty yards. TOWN OF GOLD stalked the pace from path three, got cued for the drive home, forged
to the lead with under an eighth to go, proved powerless to stall the winner, stayed on for second. LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE vied for control from along the
inside route, was roped in by the top one leaving the furlong marker, weakened into the show slot. SWASHBUCKLE took up position in midpack, chased the
pace two to three wide, pulling on the left, was more the latter coming into the stretch, mustered up a mild response. SPECTATORLESS corrected after
breaking to the outside, departed the backstretch from path four, was sighted pulling a bit on the right side, got sent out six wide for the stretch run, made no
impact. PHANTOM SMOKE lunged into the right side of the starting gate, recovered and rode the rail for the opening half, angled four wide spinning into the
stretch, lacked the necessary response. HILLBILLY LOGIC sparred for the top two wide, put together an abbreviated challenge in the vicinity of the
three-sixteenths pole, backed away after having it fizzle out. KID CASH shied away from an incoming SPECTATORLESS at the start, was three wide
entering the turn and moved out five wide exiting it, failed to menace.

Footnotes
HURRICANE HILL just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, dug in
under a drive and found a seam as MUCH TROUBLE drifted out a sixteenth from home, burst on through to split rivals and was up in the final jumps to the
finish. CHOCOLATE BAR just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive closing willingly to be up for the place honors in the final strides. MUCH TROUBLE coaxed from the gate, raced two then three wide in
closest aim of the leader, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch taking narrow command, dug in under a drive drifting out a furlong from home,
got corrected inside that station before coming out once more a sixteenth out forcing RECKLESS SPIRIT to be checked off his heels and hard held to the
finish and was caught in the last jumps to the line. LIFE ON TOP coaxed from the start, chased three then four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
angled four to five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the last major share. BIG WONDER broke in at the start bumping ATTA KID, showed
the way in hand from the two path, got out to the six or seven path into the backstretch and was tucked three then two wide, came under coaxing just past
the five-sixteenths, got headed spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive keeping on down along the rail and was outfinished in the late
going. RECKLESS SPIRIT saved ground through the first turn before racing three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole,
spun three wide for home let out for the drive, dug in under a drive rallying behind foes, had MUCH TROUBLE drift out in front near the sixteenth marker
and was checked and hard held when stymied off that rival's heels and never recovered to the finish. BAD GUY tracked the pace along the inside under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and made no late headway. MORE LIKE IT three wide through the first turn, chased five wide
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went six wide for home and offered no response. MR. VINCENT chased three to four wide under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, spun four wide for home and weakened in the late stages. CENTERFOLDPROSPECT just off the inside early on, chased four wide under a
ride from the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home and made no impact. ATTA KID bumped at the start by BIG WONDER, who broke inwards,
chased three wide, got out five to six wide through the far turn, went eight wide for home and made no impact. FALSE ALARM four to five wide in pursuit,
got coaxed along at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, folded and was eased. There was a Stewards' Inquiry as well as a claim of foul
by the trainer of RECKLESS SPIRIT alleging interference against HURRICANE HILL. After review, the objection was dismissed and the result stood prior to
the race being declared official.

Footnotes
WEGOTOLDYOUGOTSOLD sat forwardly placed from along the inside route, tipped into the two path for entrance into the stretch, closed in, altered course
into the path four to be outside the ones to catch with approximately a furlong remaining, soon joined as the outermost of three vying for command,
vanquished them both and edged clear. MANIFEST DESTINY put to some encouragement from the get-go, disputed the pace from the two path, going
about his task from between rivals to midlane, then inside another twosome for a sixteenth afterwards, won the place. EYE LUV LULU along the outside,
travelled four wide on the turn, increased its presence as the half was being completed, got cued up for the drive, was one of three battling for the lead down
the stretch, stayed for the show. KOSCIUSZKO sat parked out four wide on the turn, was slightly closer to the rail for the stretch, lacked the needed late
response. PROFESSOR SNAPE sluggish along the backstretch after brushing with another at the start, strolled onto the turn from the two path, got sent out
towards path six once in the stretch, gained but without impact. SAN JUAN DIEGO worked out a tuck into the two path at the top of the turn, took the same
one entering the stretch, had no rally. EL POTRO three wide onto the turn, was in path four wide leaving it, made no headway. BATTERBATTERSWING
guided over to the rail approaching the end of the backstretch, argued as the innermost of three to midstretch, faltered. CORPORATE RAIDER contended
from path three as the outermost of a threesome until the general area of the five-sixteenths pole before giving way. CURRENCY CHROME brushed at the
start, chased the pace three wide during the run around the bend, shifted out into the five path for the drive, failed to fire then was vanned off after the finish.
BREEZE BURNER underwent a ground-saving trip to no avail. COLTANDMISSISSIPPI inside to two wide, failed to contend.

Footnotes
MAKE IT IN NY bumped at the start by DREAMPOINT who broke inwards, chased just off the inside from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing
three furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch, angled to the inside a furlong out, rallied up the rail and was just up in the very last jump to
score. DOUBLEPOUR three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced to prompt that rival into the turn, took over command at the three-eighths,
spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive edging clear to the eighth pole, drifted out inside that station and was corrected, came under late
threat growing a bit leg weary and was nailed on the wire. ANOTHER SHOT broke in at the start bumping BOHEMIAN RUBY, raced forwardly placed four
then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, got shaken off a furlong out, ran on to come again clear for
the show honors. BOHEMIAN RUBY bumped at the start by ANOTHER SHOT, who broke inwards, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish, then was subsequently
vanned off. WICKED EASY stumbled at the start recovering outwards and brushing with PRINCE ORB, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch offering up a bid, then weakened in the stretch. DREAMPOINT broke in at the start and bumped with
MAKE IT IN NY, chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. HOLD THE IRISH
broke out at the start and was corrected, chased five wide throughout under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths and tired. TOM'S CHOICE three then two
wide just off the pace, came under coaxing half a mile from home, went six wide into upper stretch and faltered. PRINCE ORB got brushed at the start by
WICKED EASY, who recovered outwards from a stumble, showed the way in hand along the inside, got displaced from command three furlongs from home,
came under coaxing inside that station, cut the corner into upper stretch and folded.
