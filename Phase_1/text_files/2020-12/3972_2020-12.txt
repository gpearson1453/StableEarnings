Footnotes
WEE ARCH took quick control to rate a slow pace inside, came under pressure toward the quarter pole and raced at the rail rounding the far turn, then
widened the advantage under steady stretch handling. RICH IMAGE stalked the winner toward the inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths
pole and rounded the far turn just off the rail, but proved no match down the lane. CITY BIRD FLYING settled off the pace toward the inside then eased out
into the backstretch, started a bid from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn but flattened stride inside the eighth pole. GRAND
ENTRADA raced well off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the turn at the rail, but showed little in the lane. ALL EYES ON ME
stalked from the two and three paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then weakened off the rail rounding the far turn. REYANA REYA
DREAMS saved ground the first turn then rated off the pace four wide from the seven eighths pole, bid leaving the three eighths, though, weakened in the
four and five paths of the far turn.

Footnotes
BIG BOOTS saved early ground then eased outward into the backstretch, started a four wide bid approaching the five sixteenths pole and took a slim lead
two deep midway on the far turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well under steady urging. SILVER CASTLE raced hemmed in at the rail rounding the
opening turn then settled off the pace into the backstretch, steadied leaving the three eighths pole, started a bid from the five sixteenths, rounded the far
turn off the rail and dug in to take second the final yards. NO REGRETS came through the opening turn about the four path and moved to the front three
wide approaching the five sixteenths pole, drew clear toward the quarter, but was caught at the rail midway on the far turn, continued a close factor through
the upper stretch then dropped back a sixteenth away and flattened later yards. CARTER'S RUN rounded the first turn in the five path and raced well off the
pace outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path then flattened stride the final furlong. ONCE
MORE EH stalked the early pace two deep then challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, and dueled between horses to the five sixteenths before
fading. STRIVE FOR A CURE was hustled up to take the lead leaving the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the seven
sixteenths, was caught toward the five sixteenths and gave way at the rail rounding the far turn.

SO RED THE ROSE settled off the pace in the three and four paths the opening turn, bid past the three eighths pole and circled rivals six wide on the far
turn, took the lead past the eighth pole, raced clear mid-stretch and widened under steady handling. HOW IS SHE saved ground well off the pace the first
turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved in the five path of the far turn, then dug in to
take second later yards. MISS WAVE rounded the first turn off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came between horses two deep to take a slim,
although, brief lead at the eighth pole, but flattened stride inside the sixteenth. GAB'S LIL LEAGUER settled off the earlier pace in the three and four paths,
bid past the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then eased out in the upper stretch and finished evenly. OUR BAD GIRL rounded
the opening turn in the three path and stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and had aim four wide nearing the
head of the stretch, but weakened inside the eighth pole. U S FUNDS stalked the early pace two deep then moved to even terms at the seven sixteenths
pole, dueled close from that point and rounded the turn about the three path, though, weakened the final furlong. SINGINDOWNTHELANE rated a slim early
lead, was met at even terms from the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at the rail rounding the far turn then weakened the final furlong.

Footnotes
CITY PRINCESS accelerated to the lead two deep at the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole and was
steadily handled through the lane to hold on well. SHE'S RIGHT stumbled, was bumped leaving the gate and saved ground while racing well back, eased
out into the backstretch and bid approaching the three eighths pole, circled rivals five wide on the far turn and dug in through the stretch while gaining
steadily on the winner. CHARITABLE MISS settled off the pace inside the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and eased outward on the far
turn, entered the stretch in the five path then lugged in while flattening stride. QUEEN OF ANYTHING settled off the pace in the three path, bid nearing the
three eighths pole and continued in the three path of the far turn, then weakened. SWISS THUNDER broke outward to make contact with She's Right then
stalked the winner inside, chased that one from the seven sixteenths pole but faded into the far turn. BECOMING MACHEN rated off the early pace about
the three path then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened near the rail on the far turn.
