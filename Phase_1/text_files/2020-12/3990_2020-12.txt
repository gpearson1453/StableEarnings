Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE DIET bumped around at the start, raced back to the far turn with a four wide run and cleared off in the final furlong. JAZZY LADY roughed up
start, lagged back to far turn with a bold run for the place. TIZ PENNEY bounced around start, no speed to far turn, loped along for show. IT'S MINE
pressed pace to half, gained lead into the far turn, dueled through the stretch but came up empty. EDEN raced evenly with no late kick when needed in the
stretch. CARA CATERINA tracked inside to the half but gave way steadily. TRIANGLE PARK raced evenly to far turn and came up empty in the stretch.
SHE'S A DEAL never a factor. GO TWEET troubled at the start, with leaders to far turn and faltered in the drive. MOLLYS MELODIE good speed to the half
but gave way after three quarters. CAPTAIN GINNY B never a real factor. INDEPENDENCE LAW speed to duel for a half, stopped from that point readily.
