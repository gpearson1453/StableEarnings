Footnotes
CAVARADOSSI was in hand prompting the pace from the two path, bid with confidence as the second split was being finalized, cemented himself to the
front end when called upon more shortly afterwards, drew off smartly, kept busy to the end. QIAN B C underwent a two wide pursuit, angled to the outside
arriving at the end of the bend, was approximately in path three when done, went on to secure second. SMILE BRYAN tracked the front runners while taking
the inside route, began to get hand urged springing from the half mile pole, got set down a short distance from the quarter pole, swung out towards path four
for the stretch run, got outfinished. TAPIZEARANCE argued for control from along the inside for a half, then folded.

Footnotes
EXCELLENT TIMING established the front and showed the way in hand three paths off the inside uncontested, swung four wide for home, got roused
nearing the eighth pole and drew off under a light drive, then got geared down inside the final sixteenth. FORTY TWO ACE coaxed from the gate, chased
just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, proved no match for the top one while keeping on clear for the place
honors. MY BROTHER NEIL veered in at the start forcing SON OF AN EX to be taken in hand, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position for the show honors. LINDROS four wide in pursuit in closest aim of the
leader, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. FULL MOON FEVER broke in brushing the near side stall
at the start, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SCHERZANDO
four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. SON OF AN EX broke a beat slow
and was steadied at the start when MY BROTHER NEIL veered in front, chased sluggishly and greenly jogging away from the gate quickly growing
detached at the tail of the field, got eased up and was pulled up near the five-eighths pole, then walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
SOMEDAY JONES strung out three wide on the clubhouse bend, pursued the pace from midpack, entered the far turn, tipped out wider and wider until
stacked five wide coming up to the five-sixteenths pole, went on to vie as the outermost of a foursome from that stage to midstretch, fought with good
courage to poke a head down in front by the beginning of the final furlong, raced side by side with MALIBU PRO thereafter and gamely got the job done.
MALIBU PRO obtained a forward position after stumbling badly and making some contact with another right afterwards at the start, got rated along stalking
the pace from the two path, was maneuvered into path four after leaving the backstretch, crept up to contest the pace, went at the task, at times from
between foes, versus anywhere from three to four foes after crossing the halfway point of the second bend, began the last eighth engaged in a spirited
tussle with the top one, put up a good fight to the end but was denied. TWISTED TOM loped along the inside route during the opening phases, was in path
two making its way on the far turn, got sent out six wide from upper to midstretch, had a good finish down the center of the strip en route for the show.
ROAMING UNION shied in while brushing with the second place finisher in the shadow of the starting gate, chased the pace two wide early, shifted out one
wider for the run around turn two, pressed the issue from between rivals from around midstretch until around midlane, failed to claim the top and weakened.
LEGIT hustled after breaking approximately a length the tardiest, travelled in two path until the conclusion of the backstretch, was worked into path four wide
from the top of the far turn until a little beyond its midpoint, came under a drive at the five-sixteenths pole, was steered out one path farther off the rail for the
drive, lacked the necessary response. CONTROL GROUP disputed the pace from along the inside, became part of a multitude vying for control from
midway on the far turn to the furlong grounds, gave way. EKHTIBAAR prompted the pace from path two, forced to do so late on the second bend in the
middle of opponents, swung into the lane having already backed off a bit, then went on to back away even further.

Footnotes
AMORTIZATION (IRE) sat reserved in the two path in midpack for nearly three-quarters pole, swung out three wide for the drive home, closed in on the one
to catch, got engaged in a duel with the runner up, fought on with good courage to strike the top in the shadow of the finish line. MISS BONNIE T prompted
the pace from path two, grabbed away the advantage in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, slithered over towards the inside route when set down,
kicked away to her largest lead during the ensuing furlong, became locked up in a battle with the top one soon afterwards, with some lane space between
rivals, saw BRINA arrive dangerously on the scene, came out a bit, had the pilot check of BRINA check the mount in deep stretch lacking racing room,
ventured onward with good determination, got denied. BABY BLYTHE took up the chase primarily from the two path, was put to a ride spinning into the
stretch, altered course onto the inside route at the furlong ground, gained ground on the first two finishers with willingness, steadied off the heels of MISS
BONNIE T while being pinched by the top twosome in deep stretch, never regained its previous interest. BROKEN TABLE (IRE) sluggish after striking the
left side of the gate, dove to the rail, rode it until nearing the end of the backstretch, raced three three wide on the second bend, commenced the stretch
about one path farther off the inside, narrowed in en route for the last major check. PALM COURT sighted pulling during the initial stages, raced three wide
on both turns, came into the lane, stayed a forward factor for a little while before weakening in the final furlong. COAL SHAFT along the outside, travelled
three wide on the far turn after being mostly in the two path prior, got sent out into path five from upper to midstretch, mustered up a mild response. BRINA
three wide on pulling on the bit on the first turn, resumed its chase closer to the rail once on the backstretch, went three wide turning into the stretch, lacked
the needed response. FEDALIA pocketed, faltered. RICELLE along the inside, disputed the pace for almost three-quarters before backing away. TWIDDLE
tracked the pace from along the rail, went about the backstretch having been placed to a brisk hand ride, angled three wide into the lane, came up empty.
Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on MISS BONNIE T and BABY BLYTHE in deep stretch, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared
official.

Footnotes
NO LIME worked out a tuck in the two path early on the backstretch, pursued the front runners from midpack, angled three wide into the lane, narrowed in
with good momentum, altered course back into the path two leaving the eighth pole, began racing on near even terms with the runner up shortly afterwards,
narrowly prevailed. DANGEROUS EDGE pursued the three wide, angled towards path five turning into the stretch, gained ground down the center of the
track, vied matched up with the eventual winner for the final sixteenth, came up the one to be denied. BRONXVILLE two wide on the bend, raced three wide
on the straightaways, held out on the front end until approximately a sixteenth to go, stayed on for the show. DIANNESIMPAZIBLE parked out five wide on
the turn, was in the neighborhood of path six during the stretch run, closed in to earn the final significant slice of the purse. NO SALT didn't run off after
breaking open the gate, settled into the two path, was under a drive by the half mile pole, went into the lane and held its ground fairly well. MY AMANJENA
three wide on the turn, had no closing punch. ANZIO BEACH stalked the pacesetter from the outside, going about his business three wide on the turn, came
into the stretch and gave way. LARCENY four wide and asked for more by the midway point of the turn, had no response. FOTIS abandoned the rail for
path two at the half mile pole, commenced the stretch slightly wider, had no rally. KING OF AMERICAN three wide entering the turn, launched no bids.
LIGHTNING ROB strung out four to five wide on the turn, gave out. MR. FIDGET two wide and pulling on the left, was under the whip by the midway point of
the turn, failed to make its presence felt. JOY CITY cut over to the rail at the half mile pole and faltered. KNIGHT FROST saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
DOLL broke in at the start bumping CANARSIE ANGEL, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, advanced and tipped out four wide
into upper stretch set down for the drive, rallied to take over command nearing the eighth pole, edged away under a drive kept to task. ASTORIA KITTEN
chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. FRESCO bumped
solidly at the start in a chain of bumps due to MONIFICENT veering inwards, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three
wide for home and kept on to secure the show honors. ITSAKEYPER three wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path into the turn and
advanced to duel from the three-eighths with that rival to her inside, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in head to head and was overtaken by the
eventual winner a furlong out, then weakened through the final eighth. CANARSIE ANGEL bumped at the start by DOLL, who broke inwards, showed the
way in hand along the inside, came under threat at the three-eighths and dueled through the remainder of the turn, spun just off the inside for home heads
apart for command, got displaced in tandem with her main pace rival near the eighth pole and weakened through to the finish. MAGICAL ROMANCE got
bumped between foes at the start, chased three wide until tucked inside into the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. ANCIENT
BROWN bumped between foes at the start due to the pressure from MONIFICENT veering inwards, chased just off the inside under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and offered no rally. GRAETZ four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
five wide for home and weakened. MONIFICENT veered in at the start bumping MAGICAL ROMANCE into ANCIENT BROWN and in turn into FRESCO,
chased four then three wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and weakened. SUMMER AT THE SPA five paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened.
SHE SO NAUGHTY chased three wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, made no impact.

Footnotes
BREITHORN sat reserved taking up the chase from path two in midpack, angled four wide onto the top of the lane, joined up with the front runners in the
vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, vied as the outermost of three from that juncture onward, appeared to poke down in front with approximately a sixteenth
to go, edged away. CONFECTIONER forwardly placed four wide, increased his presence as the half was being completed, challenged in earnest coming up
to the three-sixteenths pole, batted from between rivals from that station until the end, won the place. MUCHO SUNSHINE secured a prominent position,
was held in reserve disputing the pace from path two in between foes for a good portion of the journey leading up to the three-eighths pole, went at it late on
the bend one on one with CONFECTIONER once THE BEAST AND I called it a day, got cued right in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole as a
three-way tussle once more got underway, this time with the winner as a participant, relinquished with about a sixteenth to go, stayed on quite well for the
show. WARFRONT FIGHTER pinched while being bumped in the shadow of the starting gate, chased the pace three wide on the turn, got sent out into path
six from upper to midstretch, made no late headway. WILD CAT WEST went inward while being hustled from the starting gate, made it over to the rail well
before reaching the conclusion of the backstretch, slipped to the outside under some hand encouragement at the five-sixteenths pole, was still on the move
to the outside spinning into the lane, mustered up a mild response racing three to four wide afterwards. LADY'S BOY pinched undergoing some contact at
the start, departed the backstretch two wide, fanned into path four early during the stretch run, flattened out. LOADED JOE bumped with another after
coming out the start, chased the pace two wide on the turn, went into the stretch, lacked the needed offering. ORPHAN HALLIE checked after getting
squeezed at the start, travelled three to four wide on the turn, shifted out six wide for the drive, launched no bids. ALITE stumbled to the left in an awkward
manner at the start, recovered in short order and got set in the three path, was in the same one coming home, tired. MARINER QUI rode the rail for nearly a
half, got steered out three wide into the stretch, made no impact. KING SLAUGHTER settled into the three path, contended as the widest of three until
midway on the turn, went on to spar outside MUCHO SUNSHINE aftewards, got called upon a short distance from the end of the bend, kept up his bid for
another sixteenth before giving way. THE BEAST AND I bobbled lightly springing from the gate, cut over to the rail, argued for control as the innermost of a
threesome until midway on the turn, folded.
