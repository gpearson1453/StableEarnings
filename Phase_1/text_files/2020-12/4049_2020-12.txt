Footnotes
NIGHT WATCH angled to the rail in early stages tracking just off the second flight flight, gained position between foes while shifting off the inside after a
half, was patiently handled while awaiting some racing room entering the far turn, then continued with a steady effort to reel in the pacesetter in a long drive
to narrowly prevail under firm right handed pressure. CROWN OF JOY settled between foes racing to the first turn, dropped out last entering the
backstretch, was prompted to advance racing four wide into the far turn and continued willingly in that path in the closing stages to just miss. ALEXBABE
tracked the leaders inside a rival as part of the second flight in the opening stages, was urged to bid for command between foes racing into the far turn,
gained a clear advantage racing into upper stretch and resisted the top pair grudgingly to the end. SAPPHIRE JUBILEE tracked the leaders between foes in
second flight racing to the far turn, shifted out to the four path entering the lane and continued evenly. PLEASE DO broke inwards while a step slow into
stride, settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to lodge a brief, three wide bid racing through the far turn but flattened out in upper
stretch. TAKIN IT EASY, urged inside a rival disputing the pace in the opening half, gave way early. ITSAGIMME'S GIRL was urged forcing the pace outside
a rival racing to the backstretch, briefly contested the lead when challenged racing into the far turn but gave way abruptly entering upper stretch.

Footnotes
DA ALPHA, restless while being saddled in the paddock, broke readily to gain a forward placing three deep in the opening stages, moved to press the issue
three deep on the turn into upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage and continued willingly to held RAG TAG to the end under brisk handling. The latter
tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn, switched out racing into the turn to advance in the four path entering the lane and
continued willingly to the end while just failing to gain even terms with the winner. DIAMOND STATE, in touch between foes in the first flight racing through
the backstretch, pressed the issue entering the turn, dueled inside the winner to upper stretch but yielded late. TAKE TO THE SKIES tracked off the first
flight outside a rival in the opening stages, worked her way to the inside racing into the turn and steadily faded. DONTLOSETHATNUMBER, urged dictating
the pace inside foes on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, couldn't match the leaders after a half and gave way into upper stretch. STRETCH
RUNNER broke slowly, shifted off the inside racing to the turn but never gained contention. ADIOS BOBBY broke slowly and soon trailed.

Footnotes
COMBAT CONTROLLER was urged inside foes from the outset disputing through the backstretch into the turn, kicked clear nearing upper stretch while
shifting well off the inside racing into the lane and held OX TROT on a narrow margin to the end under energetic handling. The latter angled inwards in the
opening stages tracking just off the first flight racing into the turn, switched outside the leader racing into upper stretch while being roused to advance, then
altered course inside that foe leaving the furlong marker but continued willingly to challenge inside that foe nearing the wire. MULLED WINE settled outside
foes in the last flight early, then continued evenly three wide between foes into the stretch to prevail for a share. KELA BREW angled to the inside while
racing as part of the last flight early, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. CHARGE CARD was hustled in the
opening stages to prompt the pace four wide through the backstretch into the turn, then gave way into the lane. KALEIDOSCOPE KID, reserved last in the
opening quarter, swung out four wide racing into the lane but had no rally. TIP SHEET, urged prompting the pace three wide between foes racing to the
turn, faded after a half. EXECUTIVE DECREE, urged between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch, gave way early.

Footnotes
SIR THADDEUS ducked outwards at the start, was quickly righted, then urged to the lead inside foes racing through the backstretch into the turn, turned
back a challenge from IMPERIAL PLACE leaving the three furlong marker to go clear into upper stretch and held sway on a diminishing margin to the end
under left handed pressure. ROGUE RAGE tracked off the first flight while angling to the inside early, saved ground on the turn advancing on the leaders
after a half, shifted off the inside in the closing stages and continued willingly to close the gap to the end. IMPERIAL PALACE came through close quarters
at the break to race in touch with the eventual winner attending that rival's pace through the backstretch, was urged to press the issue racing into the turn,
couldn't match terms with the leader racing into upper stretch and finished evenly three deep in the last furlong. TIDES OF WAR tracked off the first flight
between foes racing into the turn and steadily faded into the stretch. TINKER'S PAL tracked off the first flight three deep racing into the turn and faded after
a half. IT'S ME AGAIN broke slowly, was settled off the second flight racing outside a rival to the turn but never gained contention. CALOGERO proved no
factor. KITTEN'S CLOWN retreated early.

Footnotes
SAUCY DEREK, bumped at the start, was rated from out of striking distance as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, commenced a steady
advance on the leader racing through the far turn, lugged inwards a bit midstretch exchanging light contact with DANCERONTHEBEACH but was righted
and went clear in time under firm left handed encouragement. MECHA CORTA angled to the inside tracking the first flight from out of striking distance under
rating in the opening half, continued under patient handling inside foes racing into the far turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued
with interest to prove best of the others. DANCERONTHEBEACH ducked out at the start crowding LONG LANCE while making some contact with the
eventual winner, was righted, then urged inside a rival disputing the pace along the rail racing into the backstretch, went clear entering the far turn, shifted
out exchanging light contact resisting the winner's bid midstretch but weakened late. WHATA PERFECT DAY settled between foes the second flight racing
to the first turn, then continued evenly between foes through the stretch to improve position to the end. LONG LANCE, bumped, then squeezed back at the
start, was collected to track just off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out racing into the far turn, was fanned four wide
nearing upper stretch and steadily faded. LITTLE TEQUILA angled inwards while being urged to force the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, lost
terms with that foe nearing the far turn and gave way inside foes nearing the lane. FLORIDA EXPRESS settled in the last flight racing four wide to the first
turn and failed to menace thereafter. PINAR, reserved last along the inside, dropped out early.

WITSEL, broke outwards making some contact with ESTILO VARONIL, was righted to gain a forward placing along the inside tracking just off the
pacesetter, advanced inside that foe to press the issue nearest the rail racing through the turn, went clear into upper stretch and steadily widened the
advantage in a ridden out effort. THROWN FOR A LOUPE broke sharply, set the pace racing outside a rival on a narrow advantage to the turn, briefly
dueled for command between foes on the bend, proved no match for the winner in the final quarter but gamely edged a rival for the place honors late.
EQUULEUS, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening quarter, advanced three wide racing into the turn to briefly gain second racing
into upper stretch but was outkicked for the place honors. FOREMAN ducked at the start, then was steadied out of tight quarters, settled into stride along
the rail on the backstretch, angled outside foes racing into the stretch and made some belated progress while no real threat. ESTILO VARONIL, bumped at
the start, angled to the inside tracking the leaders from out of striking distance racing into the turn and lacked a closing response. CENTSOFWANDER
broke inwards, then was taken up avoiding tight quarters at the start, tracked the leaders outside foes racing to the turn and faded into the lane. UNCLE
CHARMING made brief pursuit of the leaders along the inside but dropped out entering the turn.

Footnotes
BEACH BAR stalked just off the pacesetter along the inside as part of the second flight in the opening half, shifted out on the far turn to bid for command
between foes, gained a clear advantage racing into the stretch and widened under pressure. ACT LIKE ARTIE came through tight quarters at the start to
track off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, split foes nearing upper stretch, then steadily gained position three deep in the closing
stages to prevail for the place honors. MAHKATO shifted off the inside to track just off the second flight racing to the first turn, steadied in close quarters
racing into the backstretch, then again entering the second bend, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch and continued with interest for a share while
outkicked for second. BROADWAY PEGGY broke sharply, angled to the inside setting the pace on a clear margin racing to the far turn, couldn't match the
winner and gave way between foes racing into the lane. U S S LOIS, reserved along the inside dropping well off the second flight racing to the backstretch,
saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. MIJET, bumped soundly, then knocked back at the start, settled last to the far turn and passed some
tiring rivals racing into the stretch. PASSIONFORTREASURE, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, gave way
racing through the far turn. LADY NOY broke inwards into the path of DIVA DANA, was righted to track the pacesetter three wide in second flight to the
backstretch, then gave way racing into the far turn. DIVA DANA shied inwards avoiding a rival at the break bumping MIJET soundly, was collected off the
rival, settled into stride but never menaced thereafter.

some momentum while shifting out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under firm handling. SHE
DAZZLE was urged between rivals pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, moved to wrest a brief advantage nearing midstretch but was collared nearing the
wire. RUBY LEE tracked off the first flight near the inside in the opening stages, shifted three wide leaving the turn advancing to challenge but was outkicked
by the top pair. INSIGHTFUL was hustled away to a clear advantage along the inside, set the pace into upper stretch and gave out leaving the furlong
marker. GRIMHILDE broke slowly, was prompted to gain some position racing four wide into the turn, then to upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid.
D FLAT WHITE tracked off the second flight three wide between foes racing to the turn, shifted inwards nearing the lane and continued evenly. DREAM TO
WIN, pinched back at the start, passed tiring rivals into the stretch. SECRET SARAH proved no threat. ESTILO DE MUJER tracked off the second flight
between foes racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. SOCIAL DISCUSSION was urged along three wide pursuing the pacesetter into the turn
and gave way nearing upper stretch. LA BABU dropped out early. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HIGHLY NOTED was urged to the lead, shifted in sharply leaving the chute while his rider adjusted his right iron, dictated the pace on a narrow margin
along the inside to the far turn, then held sway through the stretch to prevail on a clear advantage under firm left handed pressure. DELFT BLUE tracked off
the second flight between foes racing to the first turn, shifted out three deep nearing the backstretch gaining position between foes, shifted inwards a bit
moving to terms with the leader nearing upper stretch but couldn't gain even terms with that foe while prevailing for the place honors. MONDAY'S WITH
MIKE angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, conceded some position after a half, saved ground to upper stretch and continued willingly inside
foes while just outkicked for second. KICK IT CHARLIE shifted out to race between foes in second flight, then was held up dropping back racing into the
backstretch, angled out five wide entering the lane and continued with an effort to gain some position. TOP BOMB tracked just off the pacesetter three deep,
then between foes into the backstretch racing as part of the second flight, was shuffled back on the far turn, then shifted inside in the closing stages while
racing in close quarters late. OUR GREY GHOST, caught wide from the chute to the backstretch, was prompted to make some brief progress four wide
racing into the far turn, lodged a brief bid three wide between foes entering upper stretch but proved empty in the closing stages. VANDRING hopped at the
start while breaking slowly and failed to menace thereafter. BRO GUN proved no factor. TIN ROOF RUSTY tracked the leaders outside foes just off the
second flight, was forced to alter course racing four wide leaving the first turn, was prompted to lodge a brief bid in that path nearing the second bend but
soon retreated.
