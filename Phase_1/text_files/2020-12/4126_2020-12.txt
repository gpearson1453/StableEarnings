Footnotes
LIONS HOT MESS disputed the pace while loosely between horses, vied along the rail while inside of a foe on the turn, shook clear while still on his inside
lead in upper stretch, extended the advantage under a drive into the final sixteenth, swapped to the proper lead late and proved much the best under strong
urging. SOUTHERN LIGHT contested the pace on the outside, vied outside the winner in the two path on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch
and proved no match while just able to get the place. C F JOHNATHAN was sent hard from the start, pressed the pace on the inside, chased along the rail
on the turn, turned into upper stretch under an all out drive and just missed the place while able to get the show. MIDNIGHT SPIRIT bumped hard with a
rival just after the start, moved up then tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, made an outside bid under a drive in upper stretch,
lost touch with the winner outside the furlong marker and missed the trifecta. WAR ROGUE broke a step slow, was coaxed along off the pace, dropped back
near the half-mile pole, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive around the furlong marker and failed to
threaten. STARVICTORY was urged along towards the rear, dropped back leaving the backstretch, traveled around the turn in the two path and was no
factor. DEGRASSE bumped with a rival at the start and was last to commence, was ridden along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came six wide
into the stretch and failed to respond. PRINCE CARLOS bumped hard with a rival just after the start then was taken up, raced at the rear on the far outside,
went six wide on the turn then seven wide into the stretch and never reached contention. WAR RULES was fractious in the gate, bumped with a rival at the
start, was urged along near the middle of the field, went three wide on the turn and also failed to respond. BROTHER DAVID was coaxed along off the pace,
dropped back while inside on the turn and capitulated. YOUCANBETONME was urged along off the pace, went five wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
BEACHCOMBING bumped hard with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, was hard held down the backstretch, went around the far turn in
the two path, shifted four wide outside the quarter-pole, rallied to make an outside bid in upper stretch, battled with his stablemate in the final furlong and
narrowly prevailed under strong urging. NEWS BREAK went three to four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked while two to
three wide on the far turn, made a bid in upper stretch, drifted in near the eighth-pole, fought with his stablemate in the final furlong and just missed while
clear for the place. FIAT LUX went to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, set the clear pace, was asked while inside on the far
turn, drifted out in upper stretch, drifted back in while battling with two foes into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. DREAMING OF CARATS
was rated on the inside, drafted along the rail on the far turn, was asked when given a sizable rail opening in upper stretch, failed to accelerate through that
opening as the pacesetter drifted back closer to the rail at the furlong marker, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick.
PHARAOH'S KITTEN went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the far turn then carried five wide into the
stretch and failed to rally. NO KA OI broke out and bumped hard with a rival, went five wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear on the outside, was
urged along while four wide on the far turn then came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. ADEEB was off slow and spotted the front a couple of
lengths, angled in at the rear, went two to three wide on the turns, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out in the drive and was no factor.
ARION MAGIC (FR) angled in early, saved ground on the first turn, was unhurried towards the back, came under urging leaving the backstretch, rounded
the far turn in the two path and was no factor. BAYANDBUNNY dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along
while inside on the far turn and also failed to respond.

on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenths then moved clear and proved
best while eased up in the end.. LIL ADEAU was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, moved out outside the furlong marker and finished
willingly to just get the place. MA CHER AMIO was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, chased the
leaders in the drive and just missed the place while able to get the show. MY REBEL GIRL was off slow then ducked in, spotted the front a few lengths,
raced at the rear, saved ground early on the turn then shifted to the three path, lugged in some while gaining in upper stretch, angled out while finished well
late and got up for the last spot in the superfecta. OUR STARLET bumped with a rival at the start, set the pace under pressure, vied in the two path on the
turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired. G'S A LOOKER pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, battled under a
drive into the final furlong and weakened. MOLLYS FLYIN HIGH chased the pace on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn, made a bid in the six
path into the stretch then took the lead, battled under a drive into the final furlong and also weakened. IBEGTODIFFER bumped hard with a rival at the start,
settled well off the pace, raced from the two path to the four path on the turn, came eight wide into the stretch and was no factor. AUDACIOUS GIRL
bumped hard with a foe at the start, recovered to be well placed just off the pace, chased inside on the turn and capitulated. FLAT OUT CRYPTO was
fractious in the gate, brushed with a rival early, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. SLEWALYZE raced well back in the field,
dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn and showed litte. LOOKING HOT broke awkwardly and was off a step slow, went five wide on the turn,
