Footnotes
LIFECHANGINGEVENT set the pace along the inside, shook clear passing the quarter pole, and held sway through the lane. FRANKIE'S GIRL lied
forwardly placed two wide, tipped three wide turning for home while attempting to produce a bid, but failed to keep pace with the leader, lugged in on his left
lead in upper stretch putting MAIKO in tight quarters, then held place from an outer rallying foe. BAHAMIAN RHAPSODY tracked from midpack two wide,
shifted four wide turning for home, then sustained a grinding rally, but failed to catch FRANKIE'S GIRL for place. LUISANA PRINCESS tracked from off of
the pace three wide, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and stayed on for a minor share. SISTER IS DEVIL saved ground off of the pace before tipping tot he
three path in upper stretch, but failed to make an impact. VIVI'S DREAM'S stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid before tiring. AWESOME
VIEW saved ground from midpack, but to no avali. MAIKO prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart passing the
quarter pole, got outkicked and put to tight quarters in upper stretch by an outer foe, then caved while being eased through the lane. SO JADED broke
outwardly a bid, lied far off of the pace in the two to three path, and was outrun. PEDESTAL was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
PUTMAN set the pace along the inside, shook clear from a pressing foe in upper stretch, then inched away under a stout hand ride through the final furlong.
PAPA LUKE stalked along the inside, inched closer into the turn as outer foes weakened, smoothly tipped outside of the pace setter to produce a bid for the
lead at the five sixteenths pole, but proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, then gamely held place between foes in the late stages. SNOW JOB lied
far off of the pace early on, advanced four wide around the turn, then sustained a grinding rally through the lane, but missed place. REY DE LIGAS (CHI)
was off slowly, advanced while saving ground around the turn to be in range of the leader turning for home, but chased evenly through the stretch, failed to
reach place, and was nailed on the wire for show. CHARLIECANDO bumped with an inner foe at the start and lied off of the pace three wide, but was
shuffled back a bit behind weakening foes into the turn, tipped four wide in upper stretch and produced a rally, but missed minor rewards. SEEK HIM FIRST
was off a step slowly, lied far off of the pace while caught in the five path around the turn, and failed to factor. SUGAR CANDY KID bumped with an inner
foe at the start, recovered to press that foe from between horses early on, but weakened into the turn, was done early, and eased through the lane.
GEOSCIENCE was a bit antsy in the gate before it opened, then prompted the pace three wide early on, but weakened into the turn, was done early, and
eased through the lane.

Footnotes
ORBS BABY GIRL grabbed the early lead, shook off HIGH SPEED STEF and PLATINUM FROLIC in that order after a half-mile, built a commanding lead
through the furlong grounds and was kept to pressure. PLATINUM FROLIC chased three wide, could not keep up with the winner turning for home, and ran
on well enough for the place. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL had a ground-saving trip, and posed no threat. VINTAGE STYLE swung four wide approaching the
stretch, and had no rally. HIGH SPEED STEF pressed the early pace between horses, and faltered after a half.

Footnotes
NICHOLAS ROSE tracked from off of the pace two wide early on, took the turn in the four path, ranged up outside of the trio of foes turning for home as the
leader shook clear, then changed leads approaching the furlong pole, quickened, and wore that foe down on the wire. STAR WEAVER dueled for the lead
inside of a pair of foes, shook clear turning for home, but hung on his left lead through the lane, and got nailed on the wire. WILD ONE FOREVER had his
head turned a bit when the gate opened and was off a step slowly, settled at the rear two wide, shifted five wide turning for home, and offered a stout rally
through the lane, but ran out of ground. ALL INCLUSIVE lied off of the pace along the inside of a rival while in the two path, turned for home while awaiting
racing room behind the leaders, got blocked behind foes in upper stretch, tipped out to the four path approaching the furlong pole after being outkicked by
WILD ONE FOREVER, then stayed on past tiring foes for a minor share. MR NAPPY dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but failed to keep
pace passing the five sixteenths pole, but kept on through the lane to repass tired foes. DEO FORTE stalked the trio of duelers from the four path, bid at the
five sixteenths pole, shifted down three wide turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch, and weakend. GETTHE MUNY BERNIE
saved ground far off of the pace, but never got involved. I KICKN dueled for the lead three wide, tipped down two wide turning for home while other foes
ranged up along side, then weakened in upper stretch.

LONDON WEREWOLF tracked from close range inside, slipped through on the rail to take over once straightened away for the drive, and widened under
good handling.. MONEY COME was off alertly despite a solid bump with R BOY EVENS, chased after the pacesetter between horses around the turn,
moved inside and ran on late to regain second. DECKOLOGY was bumped lightly at the start by SIESTA MOON and pushed into MR. EDGAR, saved
ground outsprinted for a half-mile, moved out in upper stretch and was along to get the show. SIESTA MOON broke out bumping DECKOLOGY, advanced
around the turn three wide, but flattened out into the lane. ROSAS WAY broke out and was a step slow to begin, saved ground throughout, and passed tired
horses. CURTIN'S UP set the pace inside, entered the stretch in the two-path under siege from both flanks, and gave way. MR. EDGAR was pushed out a
bit by DECKOLOGY at the start, raced three to four wide around the turn, and tired. MR. CESCO was outrun four to five wide. SLICK STAR was shuffled
back between horses leaving the half-mile pole, and continued to lose ground to the leaders. R BOY EVENS bumped solidly with MONEY COME at the
start, and was never prominent. GATOR FIFTY TWO was finished early two to three wide.

Footnotes
ROCKET JOE COPPER was slow to get going, settled far off of the pace while caught four wide around the first turn, gained in hand down the backstretch,
inched up alongside the leaders into the far turn to vie around that bend, then forged an advantage turning for home, and inched clear through the lane.
DERBY CHAMPAGNE stalked along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and stayed on to claim
place while no threatening the leader. NATIONAL HONOR tracked from midpack two wide and between horses around the first turn, gained around the far
turn, but ran up behind traffic turning for home, shifted inwards in upper stretch, and improved along the rail. J P HELLISH set the pace along the inside,
dueled inside of a pair of foes around the far turn, but gave way to the widest rival in upper stretch, and got outfinished by foes on both sides in the late
stages. ANOTHER saved ground at the back through the first turn, then took the far turn four wide and between horses while held up mildly among traffic,
then produced a late kick to reach a minor reward approaching the wire. REMEMBER THE MAINE saved ground in midpack around both turns, tipped five
wide in upper stretch, and chased the leaders evenly through the lane. JOYFUL HEART prompted the pace two wide, dueled for the lead between horses
around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with them in upper stretch before yielding late. UNCLE CURLY lied off of the pace, but got a bit keen behind foes
in the two to three path around the first turn, then took the far turn in the four path, but failed to factor. ZAP DADDY trailed in the two path around the first
turn, attempted to rally five wide around the far turn, but failed to make an impact. CAPPY HOUR tracked from midpack three wide, inched closer to stalk
down the backstretch, but weakened into the far turn. MYSTICAL MOON settled in the three to four path around the first turn, gained down the backstretch
to be in range on the lead, but weakened into the far turn, and wilted around it.

Footnotes
WAR STOPPER broke out giving TARGET TALES a hard bump, set the pace hounded from outside by ANSWER IN, got the best of that dispute in upper
stretch and edged away under steady pressure. ROMAN EMPIRE raced three wide around the turn, and wore down ANSWER IN from outside for the place
while not a threat to the winner. ANSWER IN pressed WAR STOPPER from outside for six furlongs, and weakened in the stretch. GLORY OF FLORIDA
raced forwardly two wide to the end of the turn, and lacked a closing response. TARGET TALES absorbed a solid bump from WAR STOPPER at the break,
and was no menace three to four wide. IL FARAONE lagged far behind to the stretch, and made no real headway. GEONOSIS raced close up early inside,
gave way steadily around the turn, jogged in far behind, pulled up in distress and was vanned off.

Footnotes
SOGLIO tracked from midpack two wide, inched closer three wide around the far turn, produced a bid for the lead while bumping DOMINATE THEMOMENT
turning for home, forged an advantage passing the furlong pole, and edged clear late. GOLDEN DECISION stalked along the inside, smoothly tipped
outside of the leader turning for home to produce a bid two wide and between horses at the three sixteenths pole, but was outfinished by his outer
counterpart through the lane. ZULU advanced from far off of the pace by saving ground around the far turn, but leveled off and chased the leaders through
the lane. DUNDALK set the pace along the inside, vied inside of a foe around the far turn before meeting a pair of other bids in upper stretch, but was
headed by those rivals passing the furlong pole, and yielded through the late stages. PATRIOT DRIVE saved ground from midpack, but came under heavy
urging into the far turn, lacked a true response while shifting to the four path in upper stretch, then stayed on for a minor share. ZERO GRAVITY bumped
with an inner foe soon after the start, trailed the field, took the far turn in the three path, then improved past tiring foes through the lane. DOMINATE
THEMOMENT stalked two wide, vied around the far turn, but was bumped by an outer rival approaching the three sixteenths pole, and weakened through
upper stretch. STREET COPPER was off a step slowly and bumped with an outer foe while a bit crowded early on, settled off of the pace three wide, then
faded in the four path turning for home. IDLE TIME settled far off of the pace while tucking to the three path around the first turn, took the far turn in the two
path, but failed to factor.

Footnotes
LA INCONDICIONAL was allowed to settle inside early, shifted to the two-path to vie for command outside A BEAUTIFUL DAY turning for home, and kicked
clear through the final furlong. FANTASTIC KINGDOM saved ground in the second flight for six furlongs, moved out rallying into upper stretch, and finished
willingly. A BEAUTIFUL DAY found a good spot saving ground behind the early leaders, slipped through on the fence reaching a brief lead at the head of
the stretch, got outdueled through the furlong grounds by the winner, and was overhauled late for second. SWEET STORY settled in the middle of the field
two to three wide, and lacked the needed response. BLOSSOM BOW was three wide to the far turn before moving inside, put in a mild run along the rail into
the lane, and flattened out. YAKO broke a couple lengths slow and was well back for six furlongs, fanned six wide approaching the stretch, and passed only
tired horses. VALLEY DATE trailed inside early, shifted out three wide approaching the stretch, and posed no threat. AERODYNAMIC was three wide early,
got carried out several more paths by LILLIE'S HEAT past the quarter-pole, altered course inside that rival and made no headway. LILLIE'S HEAT set the
pace slightly removed from the inside for six furlongs, got out steadily approaching the top of the stretch while giving way, and continued to drop back.
WATCHIN THE WHEELS raced two wide, and tired before reaching the stretch. OBLIO'S WISH prompted the pace outside LILLIE'S HEAT, and steadied
behind the latter while tiring past the quarter-pole. PERT refused at the start, and walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START
BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.
