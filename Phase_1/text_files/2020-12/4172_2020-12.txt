Footnotes
UNCLE CARLITO sent hard set the pace drawing off in upper stretch pouring it on while full of run. SUPER VISION went evenly coming between horses to
upper stretch rallying late to save place. BANISHMENT in tight at the start lagged through the backside, responded on the far turn giving steady action down
the lane. TRAVEL WEST stalked the pace extending to upper stretch finishing evenly. ASTUTE WARRIOR stalked the pace chasing on the far turn, no
match in upper stretch would weaken under a drive. DEDICATED stalked the pace chasing on the far turn tiring in upper stretch. MYSTIC TIGER gave a
prompted middle move then leveled off to upper stretch. INDEPENDENT INDY dropped off early. I'LL MAKE U FAMOUS chased the pace through the far
turn wearing out in upper stretch.
