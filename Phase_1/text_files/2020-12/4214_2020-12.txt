Footnotes
BINDING TIME stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded when sat down for the drive and closed with a rush
to be in time. THIRSTYAMERICANGAL up close early from the outside, inched closer entering the turn, dueled through the drive but was no match for the
winner late while holding the place. GEAUX GOLDEN well placed from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, dueled through the drive but could not
keep pace. PALMETTOVOWMENOT chased the early pace outside, responded entering the drive and rallied late. RUN FAR RYLEE went evenly. QUEEN
BINDALA was no factor. JAMMINFORMEL forced the early pace outside and faded. DIGNITYTO INFINITY was never a threat. LOVELY TETON broke
sharp from the outside, gained a clear early margin, remained clear through the turn then gave way in the drive. SASSY CAMILLE showed little.

Footnotes
ZYPTO well placed from the inside, chased the pace up the backstretch, inched closer entering the second turn, responded entering the drive to duel with
ZENDELPHIAN through the drive and outfinished that one late. ZENDELPHIAN broke sharp from the outside, quickly gained the early margin, remained
clear up the backstretch, was engaged entering the drive by the winner, dueled with that one but was outfinished. MADELYN'S WILD MAX stalked the early
pace from the inside, advanced through the second turn, responded but could only hold position. HE'S A LADY TAMER unhurried early from the outside,
steadily advanced up the backstretch, responded entering the drive but was too late. I'LL RAISE YOU could only improve position. LINDANTE chased the
early pace inside but had nothing left. BOURNE IN NIXA was no factor. BIG GUY IAN pressed the early pace outside and faded. ALLIDOISDREAMOFYOU
had a steady fade.

PANTERITA stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn, dueled
through the second turn, gained a clear margin at the eighth pole and was well clear while lightly roused. MADISON'S WILD ONE well placed from the
inside, chased the pace up the backstretch, responded entering the second turn and was just up for the place. SEASIDE SURPRISE unhurried early from
the outside, advanced through the second turn, responded when asked but just missed the place. CAUGHT HIS EYE forced the early pace outside, made a
bid entering the second turn but had nothing for the drive. MITCH'S PINS forced the early pace outside then tired in the drive. GEORGIA DAWN chased the
early pace inside but had nothing left. SOONER SCHOONER was no factor. GREATEST GAL was no threat. TWILIGHT GLOW broke sharp from between
foes, gained a clear early margin, dueled up the backstretch then gave way.

Footnotes
POUND FOR POUND dueled from the inside early, battled up the backstretch, shook loose entering the drive, opened a clear margin at the eighth pole and
was clear late while kept to task. JIMI'S A STAR unhurried early from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a forward position entering
the second turn, angled outside for the drive and was just up for the place. BISTRAYA dueled from the outside early, battled up the backstretch, remained
forward but was outfinished for the place. SCARLETTSBLACKJACK dueled from the inside early, remained forward for the drive but could not keep pace.
POWER JET was no factor. BIG BOY DAVE REX chased the early pace and tired. MAGA MAN was finished early.
