Footnotes
SEA MY MOVES had speed from the start along the inside, made the lead entering the stretch then widened the balance of the trip while drifting out under
right handed urging and won as much the best. MISS SURPRISE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace to the top of the stretch in the
four path then was no match for the winner. LORETTAS SONG chased the pace and went evenly in the seven path. BACKSPLASH never far back, was
hard used through the stretch under consistent right handed urging while drifting out to the eight path and finished evenly. MI LUNA had good early speed,
was carried out to the nine path while intimidated by the whip of the rider of BACKSPLASH and also finished evenly. PROUD MAID MARIAN was no factor.
EXTRA SALSA raced widest and was through early.

Footnotes
CAPE MARCO DRIVE never far back, drifted un under right handed urging at the furlong marker brushing DADDY'S ON STRIKE, closed fast late, drifted in
again nearing the wire bumping hard with rivals causing his rider to lose her balance and her irons yet got up in the final stride. TRULY ELITE trailed into the
far turn, closed with a burst of speed along the rail through the stretch, was bumped by BRODYTHEOXMAN past the sixteenth pole then struck hard near
the wire and just missed. BRODYTHEOXMAN pressed the early pace, assumed command before a half, set the balance of the pace, drifted in under right
handed urging bumping the runner up late, was then struck hard by the winner near the wire and just missed. DADDY'S ON STRIKE stalked pace the pace
into the stretch, was brushed by the winner near the furlong marker then faded. GIO SAMMY set the early pace, kept pressure until deep stretch then
weakened. PIRATE'S TREASURE failed to menace. PRECIOUS JULES was no factor. BUMPA within striking distance for six furlongs, faltered. THE
STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDERS OF BRODYTHEOXMAN, TRULY ELITE AND DADDY'S ON STRIKE LODGED CLAIMS
OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF CAPE MARCO DRIVE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED CAPE MARCO DRIVE AND PLACED HIM THIRD.

Footnotes
CARINA prompted the early pace two wide, dropped inside on the far turn, steadied nearing the quarter pole, slipped through to make the lead at the top of
the stretch and drew odd under brisk handling. SHINY SURPRISE made the lead soon after the start, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was no
match for the winner. MUSHABOOM close up inside, shifted out to the six path on the second turn and finished with good courage. IRISH THUNDER failed
to menace. SHESWILDNFREE moved up two then three wide through the far turn then came up empty. VELVET SAMI was no threat. TEATOE was no
factor. PORT MARIA close up early, was through after a half.

Footnotes
SMALL TOWN HERO dueled for the lead along the inside into the turn, shifted out three wide, came on again through the stretch and proved best in a stiff
drive. LOVE NEST never far back, dug in four wide through the stretch and got up for second. GEHRIG stalked the pace outside and surged late to finished
on even terms with LOVE NEST at the wire. ROYAL BLUE BOY trailed though always within striking distance, bid along the rail into the stretch, lacked
racing room, altered course two wide, was in tight between rivals past the furlong marker and finished with good courage. SPECTACULAR ROAD dueled for
the lead two wide into the turn, shook clear, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. HICKORY HILL stalked the pace five wide and lacked the
needed response.

Footnotes
THE MAN CAN dueled for the lead three then two wide, dug in determinedly and shook clear late under right handed urging. TAPSHOT hopped at the start,
trailed into the turn, closed fast in the four path through the stretch and got up for second. HOWIE'S ANGEL was squeezed at the start, battled for the lead
two wide then along the inside until deep stretch then was outfinished. DREAM PRIZES vied for the lead four wide and went evenly. CAPTAIN WES dueled
for the early lead along the inside, checked when in tight approaching the turn and dropped out of it. PAINTED POSSE was no threat. STREAKY had speed
into the turn then gave way. FOREVERJUMBONMIKE was always outrun, stopped on the turn, was eased to the wire, pulled up injured and was vanned off.
THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
