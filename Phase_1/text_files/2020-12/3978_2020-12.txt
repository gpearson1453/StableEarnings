Footnotes
MINEWELLRECEIVED set the pace along the inside, dug in to hold an advantage from the bidding BIG BOSS LADY turning for home, and repelled that
rival passing the sixteenth pole to win going away. BIG BOSS LADY tucked along the inside into the first turn while rating off of the pace, progressed and
split foes three wide around the far turn to produce a bid for the lead turning for home, but hung on her left lead through the lane and was turned away by
the inner leader passing the sixteenth pole. KAUFY FUTURES stalked along the inside around both turns, but failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper
stretch. WHISPERING ROSE stumbled badly at the start, trailed along the inside around both turns, then rallied along the rail through the lane. U S S LOIS
lied unhurried off of the pace three wide around the first turn, then got caught five wide around the far turn, stayed on through the lane, but failed to threaten.
BATI BATI broke through the gate pre-race, and was outrun therafter. CAN'T KATZ HER tracked from midpack two wide around the first turn, four wide
around the far turn, and weakened. PUFFER FISH stalked two wide, but weakened in upper stretch.

DOODLE HOPPER trailed along the inside early on, then two wide around the far turn, tipped four path in midstretch to be outside of the leaders, and
produced a strong late kick to just get up at the wire. FORWARD MOTION pressed from along the inside, tipped outside of his outer counterpart into the
turn, bid for the lead and forged an advantage at five sixteenths pole as KALU ranged up alongside, dueled gamely inside of that foe through the lane,
fended him off, but was nailed by an outer oncharging foe on the wire. KALU stalked three wide, came under a drive at the three furlong pole, bid for the
lead turning for home, dueled outside of the game FORWARD MOTION through the lane, but was denied by that rival and nailed by another on the wire.
LEGACY AZTECA chased the pace from the two to three path around the turn, and failed to threaten. FOG WARNING saved ground but failed to factor.
FOX ROX set the pace two wide early on before clearing into the turn, then met a pair of bid a the the five sixteenths pole, and gave way in upper stretch.
SACRAMENTO Q tracked from midpack four wide, and was done early.

Footnotes
DREAMINOFDASIES tracked from midpack two wide, cleared an inner foe and loomed from the inside of, and behind, the trio of duelers around the far turn,
surged through a rail opening turning for home, blew past the leaders, drew off under driving pressure through midstretch, and was wrapped up late.
RIDGELYSREDHOT stalked along the inside, came under a drive and failed to keep pace approaching the five sixteenths pole, swung five wide while
regaining stride turning for home, then stayed on outside of tiring foes to achieve place. HIGHRHYTHMDIXIE set the pace inside of a pair of pressing foes,
repelled those rivals turning for home, but left the rail open in the process, proved no match for an inner bidding foe turning for home, then weakened on her
left lead through the lane. I AM A. LURING prompted the pace two wide and between horses, but weakened while drifting outwards turning for home. TRAP
GIRL trailed along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, and passed tired foes without menacing. KATIE FALOONA lied off of the pace in the four
path around both turns, got floated to the five path at the quarter pole, then wider turning for home, and failed to factor. PURPLE PEOPLEEATER prompted
the pace three wide, but weakened while being herded out turning for home. KATZ THE STORM veered in at the start, saved ground off of the pace, but
was done early, and showed little.

four path around the far turn, and stayed on outside of tiring foes with a mild rally. DOHKO was crowded between horses at the start, tracked from midpack
two wide, stalked along the inside around the far turn , but failed to produce a bid. FLATLANDER was wrestling with the assistant starter when the gates
opened and was unprepared at the start, then raced far off of the pace in the three path around the turns and improved. EL TOTO saved ground but to no
avail. TWISTED TREASURE set the pace along the inside, drifted out turning for home, then weakened after being headed at the furlong marker. CORCEL

RECORDER dueled for the lead along the inside, shook clear passing the three sixteenths pole, and drew off. SOUR KICKS stalked two wide, bid for the
lead three wide turning for home, but proved no match for the leader in upper stretch, and reached place late. MAGICAL TALE dueled for the lead two wide
and between horses, but proved no match for his inner counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, kept on between horses through the lane, but was
outfinished for place. WELD lied close up along the inside, then stayed on after failing to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, but missed place.
SHAKEM N BREAKEM saved ground while trailing, then swung five wide in midstretch and rallied mildly. ROCK THE PARK saved ground, but to no avail.
SMART WARRIOR lied far off of the pace three wide, got herded out turning for home, but had to avoid a fallen rider passing the three sixteenths pole, then
improved. IBERICO tracked from midpack from the five path around the turn, but weakened turning for home, then was clipped by a trailing foe passing the
three sixteenths pole. ANDREW THE BULL lied off of the pace four wide, but was herded out turning for home, then had to avoid a fallen rider in upper
stretch. HACIENDA BLVD dueled for the lead three wide and between horses, but weakened into the turn. RED NATION prompted the pace four wide,
stalked into the turn, but drifted out while weakening approaching the quarter pole, then was bothered when an inner rival lost his rider passing the three
sixteenths pole, and protected thereafter. UNCLE KEVIN tracked two wide, shifted out turning for home, but clipped heels passing the three sixteenths pole,
and lost the rider, then walked off. Following a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run, no change was made to the original order of finish.

the drew away from her inner dueling counterpart passing the furlong grounds. SHEDANCESFORFATE saved ground from midpack, smoothly shifted to the
two, then three, path passing the three sixteenths pole, and rallied to secure place. GOLDEN IBIS (FR) pressed the pace two wide, vied down the
backstretch before inheriting an advantage into the far turn, dueled inside of LENTEN ROSE turning for home, but was headed by that rival in upper stretch,
then yielded through the final furlong. GAELIC TALES lied forwardly placed two wide and between horses around the first turn, took back to midpack into
the backstretch before ranging up mildly four wide around the far turn, but leveled off through the lane. LEXOPHILIA stalked along the inside, then two wide
into the far turn to pass a tiring foe, but failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch. GAELIC GOLD saved ground far off of the pace around the first
turn, then took the far turn three wide before swinging five wide turning for home, but failed to mount a rally. THREE SIDED STORY saved ground far off of
the pace, took the far turn two wide, but found traffic while trying to shift out turning for home, got through in upper stretch, but failed to menace. CHILLS

three wide, but was outmoved and weakened at the five sixteenths pole. CANTERBURY GOLD set the pace along the inside, but was headed into the far

Footnotes
RUSSIAN ROULETTE cleared off and set a fast pace, widened her advantage through upper stretch under driving pressure, and was ridden out under hand
urging late. BUSTIN HEARTS chased the pace along the inside around the turn, shifted outside of the leader turning for home, but failed to keep pace with
that rival in upper stretch, then just held place from an inner foe. LEDECKY saved ground far off of the pace, and rally along the inside through the lane, but
missed achieving place. MIZZEN AIR lied forwardly placed three wide around the turn, but drifted to the five path turning for home, and tired in midstretch.
ELUSIVE RYDER tracked from midpack along the inside, but failed to threaten. PASSION'S IMAGE failed to factor. KISS THAT DUDE failed to get
involved. WARM lied forwardly placed two wide and between horses around the turn, but weakened turning for home. ONE SLICK FACT was done early.

Footnotes
KODIAK BROWN saved ground from midpack, advanced to stalking position into the far turn, awaited racing room behind the leaders in upper stretch, split
them with a quick surge passing the furlong pole, and drew off while being ridden out to the wire. VIOLATOR prompted the pace three to two wide, dug in to
hold an advantage from between rivals in upper stretch, but proved no match for an inner foe passing the furlong pole. BUC'S INVESTMINT saved ground
while unhurried early on, advanced while shifting to the four path turning for home, and rallied to reach show. HUBBA BUBBA tracked from midpack three
wide, bid for the lead turning for home, but hung on his left lead and flattened out in midstretch. HUSBAND IN LAW stalked inside, then two wide around the
far turn, and stayed on through the lane but failed to menace. ALADDIN SANE lied far off of the pace two to three wide around the turns, got floated to the
six path turning for home, and failed to threaten. WILSHIRE DIAMOND trailed along the inside early on, swung to the four to five path turning for home, and
had no rally. FREE FLAYME set the pace, vied inside of a rival around the far turn, but gave way and wilted in midstretch. AWESOME ENOUGH vied along
the inside, steadied in tight quarters into the first turn, tugged to re-vie two wide and between horses, but faltered into the far turn.
