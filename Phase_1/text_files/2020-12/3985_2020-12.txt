Footnotes
IN THE ARCH came out at the nine-sixteenths and bumped JUSTIN'SMEMORIES then steadied while corrected inward, leveled out shortly thereafter,
started the turn in the two path, angled five wide while gaining at the five-sixteenths, rallied six into the stretch then drifted in while making a bid, drifted out
under a left-handed whip while moving clear into the final furlong then was switched to a right-handed whip and drew away under steady handling. GO
ORTEGO GO broke out at the start, showed good speed and set the pace, vied inside on the turn, extended the advantage late on that bend, was
challenged while under a drive in upper stretch then lost the advantage to the winner and proved no match while just able to hold the place. AWE SHACKLE
came outward some at the start, showed speed on the inside of two foes, dropped back midway down the backstretch, fell further back while inside on the
turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, gained ground in the final furlong and finished willingly to just miss the place while narrowly able to get the
show. REDOUX settled on the outside, was urged along while three then two wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased the winner
into the final furlong and just missed the trifecta. MANGO TREE broke a bit slow while carried out, was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn,
gained passing the five-sixteenths, chased five wide into the stretch and tired. SAINT GOAR bumped with a foe near the nine-sixteenths then steadied,
dropped back between horses leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. JOE'S HEIFER came outward at the start, pressed
the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated. JUSTIN'SMEMORIES had the rider fall back in
the saddle early, was bumped by IN THE ARCH and forced into another foe at the nine-sixteenths then checked, raced inside early on the turn then moved
to the two path and was no factor. Following a stewards' inquiry into the incident on the backstretch, no change was made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
FANCY MALLORY was hustled to the lead, set the clear pace, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when set down in upper
stretch and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. DANCE AWAY broke a bit awkwardly, climbed badly towards the rear on the outside, went
four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch then drifted out under a left-handed whip, gained into the final furlong and finished with good
energy to safely secure the place. MANDOLINE STAR was coaxed along towards the front, saved ground on the turn, shifted to the two path while asked at
the quarter-pole and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. MONEY WELL SPENT lost her footing at the start but broke with the field, settled
nicely off the pace, was roused while inside to the two path on the turn, came under the whip in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. SINCERITY
settled off the pace, was given her cue while four wide on the turn, turned five wide into the stretch under a drive and came up empty. BALOOK raced at the
rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and was no factor. ELLA'S LIL STAR tracked the
pace on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BIBLEMAN was reluctant to load, chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, gained passing the five-sixteenths, took the lead into the
stretch, shook clear inside the three-sixteenths then was put to the whip, drew away under a drive into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand ride
late while much the best. DIXIE STREET was urged along on the outside, steadied briefly while passing a fallen rival early on the turn, went three to four
wide on that bend, turned into the stretch under a drive and safely secured the place. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER angled in while speeding clear, vied in the
three path for most of the turn, dropped to the two path under threat late on that bend, lost the advantage to the winner into the stretch and tired while clear
for the show. SWINGING GALAXY bobbled at the start, was urged along off the pace, checked alongside a fallen rival early on the turn, dropped to the rail
before the five-sixteenths and came up empty. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU moved out while urged along off the pace, dropped from five to three wide early
on the turn then moved to four wide late on that bend, was driven five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. WHATAFIND was void of speed, negotiated
his way inside a spill early on the turn, saved ground into the stretch and was no factor. GEM OF CARLOS settled off the pace, clipped the fallen foe while
attempting to clear that foe early on the turn and unseated the rider then was walked off after the race. HASHTAG SPEED was slow into stride, raced well
back in the field, unseated the rider in the spill early on the turn then was caught near the wire and also walked off then was reported to have bled.
DIAMOND PALACE was urged along in third position, stumbled near the seven-sixteenths and fell but returned to his feet and was caught in the stretch
then also walked off. Following a stewards' inquiry into the incident at the seven-sixteenths, no change was made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
FIRESIDE KITTEN bumped with foes on both sides at the start, settled on the inside, came off the rail after being roused near the five-sixteenths, shifted
three wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed well to get the lead into the final sixteenth then drew clear under strong urging. LADY KAZA went to
the front, set the clear pace on the inside, was challenged by SNEAKY DIANNE near the five-sixteenths then asked nearing the quarter-pole, shook off that
foe in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth-pole but was overtaken by the winner while just able to get the place. HAPPY SONRISA bumped with a rival at the
start, was taken under a tight hold early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, went three then two wide on the far turn, was roused at
the five-sixteenths, shifted four wide into the stretch then moved further to the outside and finished willingly to just miss the place while clear for the show.
SUMMER EXPRESS bumped with an opponent at the start, settled towards the rear on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, raced under a drive
into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while improving position for the last spot in the superfecta. SNEAKY DIANNE bumped with a foe at the start,
rounded the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid under urging in the two path on the far turn, dropped back under a drive in
upper stretch and weakened. SOMTHINGSCANDALOUS bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled near the middle of the
field, was roused while four wide on the far turn then driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MISS SOONER GIRL rounded the
first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, saved ground on the far turn and was no factor. GIO'S LIL ANGEL went four then three wide on the first turn,
settled well back in the field, was urged along while two then three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, quickly shifted out several paths
more shortly thereafter and failed to respond. CAZADORA broke out at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked while
three wide on the far turn, chased five wide into the stretch and capitulated. TOP HAT TANTRUM went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside,
dropped back with a half-mile to run, went five wide on the far turn and showed little. NO CON TESTA was taken back early, went three to four wide on the
turns, drifted inward in upper stretch and faltered. (Rail at 8 Feet)

Footnotes
ROCK ME was hustled from the start then taken in hand early, tugged at the bit under stout restraint while just off the pace, started the turn in the two path
then shifted four wide while let out, advanced to make a three wide bid into the stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker and proved best under steady
handling. CLUB SODA was off slow then rushed up to take the lead, moved clear leaving the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path, was headed in
upper stretch, fought with the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished while able to hold the place. FLASH ATTACK settled towards the rear, saved
ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, angled out inside the three-sixteenths and finished with good courage to garner the show. BAJAN
CASH was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, gained passing the five-sixteenths, moved off the rail in the drive and lacked the needed
kick. NINTH STREET broke a step slow while carried out, was urged along on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, gained passing the
five-sixteenths, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. FAMILIAR RHYTHM broke out and a half-step slow, went five wide on the turn and was no
factor. KASILOF broke a half-step slow, tracked the pace on the outside, chased four then five wide on the turn and came up empty. CHIEF ENVOY broke
out at the start, showed speed in front early, lost the lead inside the five-eighths, dropped back leaving the backstretch, moved from the rail to the three path
on the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
TEMPLE CITY TERROR went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was coaxed along in the two path on the far turn, shifted four
wide into the stretch then moved out seven wide, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up in the final two strides. IN GOOD SPIRITS
went around the first turn in the three path, contested the pace on the outside, moved clear around the nine-sixteenths, controlled the action in the two path
on the far turn, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, shook off foes inside the three-sixteenths, led under the whip until the final two strides but
was denied while just able to get the place. RUSSIAN MAFIA was reserved on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, was roused while cutting the
corner into the stretch, rallied against the rail into the final furlong, shifted out approaching the sixteenth-pole and finished fast to just miss while able to get
the show. YLIKEDIS was taken in hand early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, went two to three wide on the far turn,
moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch and finished with good courage for the last spot in the superfecta. PRANKED was taken in hand early, went
four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused while four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch then was carried out and lacked
the needed kick. DESERT OASIS (GB) went three wide on the first turn, was rated outside in the second flight, came under urging while four wide on the far
turn, made a bid into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong, was carried out around the sixteenth-pole and weakened. KETTLE VALLEY disputed
the early pace on the inside, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths then shifted out, was asked in the three path on the far turn, made a bid into the stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and came up empty. PERFECT REINS was taken in hand early then rated near the inside, moved closer with a half-mile
to run, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked at the top of the stretch and also came up empty. (Rail at 8 Feet)

Footnotes
LOUISIANALIGHTNING was very reluctant to load, showed good speed while hustled, set the pace on the inside, extended the advantage under coaxing
on the turn, drew off late on that bend, responded well into upper stretch, was given once crack of a down-turned whip near the furlong marker, raced under
a strong hand ride into the final sixteenth then was eased up in the final forty yards while much the best. FAITH'S RACEDAY settled on the far outside, was
urged along while five wide on the turn then driven six wide into the stretch, pursued the winner while still on his inside lead in the drive and safely secured
the place. GRAND PRIORITY broke a half-step slow, angled in while urged along off the pace, raced between horses passing the half-mile pole, chased in
the two path while still between horses on the turn then was driven three wide into the stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. OUR LAST SHOT
broke a step slow then bumped with a rival, was taken up significantly between horses early, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch
and improved position without threatening. CROWN ME JACKSON bumped twice with foes at the start then dropped back, went four to five wide on the
turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. IN A BIND was urged along well back in the field, went four wide on the turn, moved out in upper
stretch and failed to threaten. CANDY SHOPPER was coaxed along on the outside, chased four wide while between horses on the turn, was driven five
wide into the stretch and tired. BAQUERO'S BIND broke a half-step slow at the start, lacked early speed under urging, went two to three wide on the turn
and never reached contention. CAJUN NAVY was well placed just off the pace, chased inside on the turn and capitulated. KINGSTON STREET raced
towards the front, dropped back between horses near the half-mile pole, checked into the turn, went three to four wide on that bend, spun five wide into the
stretch and had nothing left. CUSTOMADEFORASAINT bumped with a foe at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the turn then
came four wide into the stretch and faded. REPOSADO was urged along early then taken in hand midway down the backstretch, raced inside early on the
turn then moved to the two path and faltered.

DOC GIRL broke a half-step slow, moved up to take the lead then shook clear with a half-mile to run, vied inside of a foe while in mostly the two path on the
turn, shook off that opponent into upper stretch, responded well into the final furlong and held under strong urging. NAUGHTY RENDEZVOUS settled in the
front half of the field, chased three wide on the turn then came four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and finished willingly for the place.
SPECIAL ASSISTANT raced just off the pace while between horses, made a bid passing the seven-sixteenths, vied outside the winner in the three path on
the turn, lost touch with that foe into upper stretch and weakened but just held the show. SNEAKY settled well back in the field, saved ground on the turn,
gained along the rail in the stretch and finished with good courage to just miss the show. ART ROCK was off slow and spotted the front several lengths,
went three to four wide on the turn and improved position without threatening. FASTEST SPIN ducked in badly at the start, settled under some urging, went
three to four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty. SOLAR REFLECTION dropped back early, saved ground on the
turn and was no factor. IMPEACH ME showed early speed, was eased back near the half-mile pole, dropped further back while inside to the two path on the

Footnotes
AMOREENA STAR bumped with a rival at the start then was taken up, raced well off the pace under urging, went four wide on the turn, rallied six wide into
the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead near the furlong marker, kicked clear into the final sixteenth and held off the runner-up under strong urging.
HEART THAT BINDS broke a half-step slow, settled off the pace while racing with her head turned to the inside, started the turn in the two path, shifted five
wide late on that bend, moved out in upper stretch, rallied outside while still on her inside lead into the final furlong, closed well while continuing on her
inside lead to the wire and missed while clear for the place. DEBS PRAYER was urged along off the pace, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the
two path, gained three wide into the stretch under a strong drive, moved out around the three-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong and weakened but
held the show. FORT PIKE was urged along on the outside, dropped from five to three wide early on the turn, gained five wide into the stretch, took the lead
near the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner in the vicinity of the furlong marker and also weakened. LOOKING HOT bumped with a rival at
the start, dropped back while ridden along, went three turn on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. OUR
STARLET broke out then was sent hard, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path while still inside of a foe on the turn, dropped back
under a drive into the final furlong and tired. SLEWALYZE bumped with a rival at the start, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the
turn, moved out in upper stretch and was no factor. MAYBE BABY bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along on the outside, went three then two
wide on the turn and came up empty. FLAT OUT CRYPTO brushed with a foe after the start, chased the pace, angled in near the half-mile pole, saved
ground on the turn and capitulated. SHOP AROUND broke out and bumped with a rival, raced well back in the field, went three to four wide on the turn and
showed little. MA CHER AMIO brushed with a rival after the start, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three to four path on the turn and faded.
