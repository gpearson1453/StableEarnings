BLUE MONARCH was never far back early, rallied four wide in the stretch, drew off late under right handed urging. THE MAN CAN dueled four wide down
the backside, battled in the stretch, could not match strides late with the winner but was second best. STREAKY dueled early dropped back on the far turn,
came again in the stretch. DREAM PRIZES pressed the pace three wide and faltered in the stretch. DERBY INCLUDED dueled on the lead until the top of
the stretch, then gave way. PAINTED POSSE was outrun.

the best. SOLE FACTOR was never far back early, swung wide in the stretch, was no match for the winner but was second best. REIGN SHOWERS was
unhurried early, swung wide in the stretch and had mild bid. DREAM FEVER was slow early, improved late on the inside while no threat. COLLUDE was
well placed for a half, lacked a late response. TICKETY BOO raced close up early, tired in the stretch. NEVER FORGET HER set the early pace and quickly
gave way. DOROTHYFROMDUBLIN raced inside and gave way badly.
