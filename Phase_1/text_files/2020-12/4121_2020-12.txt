off the rail dueled, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. E BAR GOLD forced the early pace, raced between rivals and weakened late.
SOUTHWESTERN HOPE was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside, angled out and flattened out. MEGA SOURCE was reserved early, raced
between rivals into the turn and offered no rally. DAPIRATE was taken back early, went six wide into the turn, angled in and never fired. SOME ASSEMBLY
REQD raced in mid pack early from between rivals and was empty. DIABOLICAL TIME was taken back, went seven wide and had no impact. DANDY DON
WHO was void of any early speed, circled eight wide and never fired. NATIVE EVENT was unhurried and was no factor. GABBY WHO was no threat.

Footnotes
NOW PLAYING was allowed to settle early, circled seven wide into the turn, took control late and edged clear. RUN AND TELL DAT was outrun early, went
three wide into the turn, angled in and was closing late. ZIPZAPZOOM set a pressured early pace, opened up, couldn't sustain the pace and held for third.
NAVARONES SPARKLE chased the early pace from between rivals and weakened. RECOMPENSE was taken back early, raced along the inside, angled
out and offered no late rally. LAURA BELLE raced in mid pack from between rivals and gave way. ICY CAPE was outrun early and had no impact. LETHAL
ENTITY was reserved early, circled eight wide and flattened out. SASSY QUEENIE was taken back early, went six wide and offered no rally. DE FELINA'S
SONG pressed the early pace, raced off the rail and tired. SOPHIE BLUE was taken back and was no factor.
