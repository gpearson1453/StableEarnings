REECE'S PRIORITY dueled from the inside early, battled through the turn, remained engaged through the drive and outfinished rivals late. HOLY SUNRISE
up close early from the outside, chased the pace through the turn, responded but just missed. MR MAKEITHAPPEN well placed from the inside, made a bid
entering the turn, responded and rallied late for the show. TAPIT ON RACE DAY far back early, advanced outside through the second turn, responded but
was too late. SPREAD THE FAITH could only improve position. CAT ON THE ROOF dueled from the outside and faded. OUR PRINCE chased the early
pace and tired. PAT ME DOWN was no factor. KISS OF THE WOLF was never close. FLASH DANCERLUCK was always outrun.

GOTTA GO chased the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, gained a clear margin through the second turn, remained well
clear at the eighth pole and proved much the best while never asked. ABOVE BOARD broke sharp from the outside, gained a clear early margin, remained
clear up the backstretch, remained forward for the drive but was no match for the winner. RUN TAPPY outrun early, advanced outside through the second
turn, came five wide into the drive and rallied late for the show. KING OF THE TESTO chased the early pace outside, dropped back, responded and rallied
but too late. PINCH ASSAULT could only improve position. STUART HALL chased the early pace and tired. WHY GOD was never a factor. CARBONATED
was never a threat.

Footnotes
NANA'S JOY unhurried early from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn, responded when
sat down for the drive and found her best stride in time. WILDABOUT AUDREY dueled from the outside early, battled up the backstretch, remained
engaged through the drive but was outfinished. CHARZEE BABY dueled from the inside early, fought up the backstretch, remained engaged for the drive
but was outfinished. HICLASS PRODUCTION chased the early pace outside, made a bid entering the drive but could not sustain the effort. STORIED TRIP
could only improve position. SWEET AMELIA went evenly. SUCKERFORAGREY forced the early pace and faded. HONEST WOMAN was never close.
OLD FASHION AMOUR had a steady fade.
