Footnotes
SACRA HOXEN was asked for speed inside, set the pace while pressured by IDAHO TORNADO, began to clear past the five sixteenths, opened up further
under a drive from the three sixteenths to midstretch, and drew off further under hand urging past midstretch. MAJOR BIZKIT came away sharply, tracked
the leading pair three wide, bid past the five sixteenths, came into the lane still three wide, proved no match for SACRA HOXEN but kept on under a drive to
prove a clear second best. WELLFIELD settled two wide in the rear pair, continued in the three path on the turn with the rear group, swung out in upper
stretch, rallied five wide under a drive and got up narrowly for the show. STOSH broke inward and bumped LOOKIN' AT MIKE in the opening strides, settled
in the rear pair inside of WELLFIELD, began to rally near the turn for home, split horses three wide past the furlong mark, kept on but was outkicked for the
show. MEMORIES OF ARTIE raced between horses four wide in the tracking flight, continued to track four wide on the turn and into upper stretch, proved
no match for the pacesetter into the lane, and could not hold the closers at bay for the show. BEE ATTACK chased toward the rear, saved ground through
the turn, was driven inside into the lane and responded with an inside rally, but flattened out in the final furlong. IDAHO TORNADO pressed the pace outside
of SACRA HOXEN to the five sixteenths and emptied out. LOOKIN' AT MIKE was bumped by STOSH in the opening strides, tracked five wide early,
gradually lost position four to five wide on the turn, and continued to fade in the lane.

Footnotes
TURFMEISTER saved ground around the first turn, continued to lead the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled briefly from the rail around the far
turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off in the final furlong while being kept to the task. CONSPICUOUS BOX raced in the two path around the
first turn, continued off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began to move up while racing in the three path on the far turn, swung wide entering the
stretch and continued to gain ground on the outside from there. ROAR OF THE LION was pinched back leaving the gate, dropped back to trail the field from
the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and gained ground in late stretch. BEAST MODE saved
ground around the first turn, raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and passed tiring horses in the
stretch. TORNADO BOY hopped up slightly leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on
the inside, and finished evenly on the rail while never truly threatening. TRES GENERACIONES raced in the three path around the first turn, settled on the
outside just behind the leaders for the run up the backstretch, began a bid passing the half mile pole, dueled for the lead briefly from the three path entering
the stretch, and faded in the final furlong. DRIVER DAN stumbled slightly leaving the gate, pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn and up
the backstretch, moved up to duel for the lead between horses on the far turn, could not go with the eventual winner entering the stretch and continued to
tire from there.

Footnotes
ETCHED IN STONE tracked three wide early, continued to track two wide on the turn, was driven past the quarter, led with a furlong remaining, and drew
off while shown the crop late. BUCK MOON chased outside early, edged closer in the four path on the turn, was driven from near the five sixteenths, chased
on while no match for ETCHED IN STONE down the lane, but reeled in DREAM KEEPER for the place in the final fifty yards. DREAM KEEPER soon led,
set the pace in the two path on the turn, was pushed along into the stretch and driven past the three sixteenths, reluctantly ceded the lead to ETCHED IN
STONE with a furlong remaining, and lost the place inside the final fifty yards. MKAR THE FAST settled toward the rear, was pushed along and began to
improve three wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane, drifted out further but nonetheless rallied well enough to prove best of the rest. TIZRIK tracked
the pace between horses early, settled back past the half mile mark, chased toward the rear in the two path on the turn, was driven inside into the lane, and
improved mildly. WILDWOODS DREAM broke in and bumped ABOVE NIKE in the opening strides, was hard to settle while racing in second last down the
backstretch, saved ground in the rear flight through the turn, and lacked the needed rally in the lane. BRAVO BRAVO raced at the inside of the tracking
flight, was driven inside to keep up into the lane, but weakened. FRONTIER CHARLIE was slow into stride, settled at the rear, was urged in the three path
on the turn, and offered no rally. ABOVE NIKE was reluctant to load, got bumped by WILDWOODS DREAM in the opening strides, chased between horses
down the backstretch, continued between horses with the rear group on the turn, and faded.

Footnotes
LONESOME DREAM was hustled out of the gate to press the pace on the outside, raced in the three path around the turn, dueled for the lead between
horses in upper stretch and prevailed to the wire. TALIS PARK GRAD chased the leaders on the inside early, began a bid from the two path approaching
the three eighths pole, ran into slight traffic at the three sixteenth pole, angled out to find room, and continued to gain ground on the outside but couldn't get
by the winner. ROCKET RIDE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, began to move up
from the two path around the turn and continued to gain ground in late stretch. BEE HAPPY ATTACK brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate,
raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and made a mile gain of ground in the stretch. A
SHEEN CAT veered out slightly leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path,
launched a bid at the quarter pile and was outkicked between horses in the final sixteenth. BOOGY SOKS chased the leaders on the outside up the
backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and weakened in late stretch. IRISH LIGHTED ROAD dueled for the lead between horses in the early
going, raced in the two path around the turn, entered the stretch in striking contention and faded in the final furlong. LASTEN IMPRESSION bumped with
the horses to either side leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and
flattened out in the stretch run. BERACUDA HEART dueled between horses in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn, and tired on the rail in the
stretch. ROADTAP hit the gate leaving it, trailed well behind the field up the backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch from the three path and
was never a factor. JUNIOR SPRADLIN dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the turn, began to drop back
passing the three eighths pole and was done early. CRAFTY OAK'S RUN raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, navigated the
turn from the three path and was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
MY MORNING GAL tracked the leading pair inside of KATIE M'LADY, settled back in fourth past the five eighths, saved ground through the turn, was urged
past the three eighths to take closer order inside, came into the lane under a drive inside, altered two wide behind AVASARALA approaching the three
sixteenths, rallied two wide, took the lead past the sixteenths and edged past. AVASARALA was put on the lead, set the pace while prompted by JOLINA
early, led in the two path on the turn, went to a drive past the three sixteenths, dug in when confronted by MY MORNING GAL, was nonetheless headed
past the sixteenth, but kept on willingly to the wire. JOLINA veered out sharply most of the way to the outside fence at the break, prompted the early pace
outside of AVASARALA, tracked in range three wide around the turn, was driven three wide into the lane, kept on willingly under a drive but did not have
enough to reel in the leader. HEART OF REASON broke a step slowly, settled at the rear and soon lost touch with the field, trailed while saving ground
through the turn, went to a drive inside in upper stretch, and took closer order while drifting out late. KATIE M'LADY was extremely reluctant to load, broke a
step slow, tracked the leading pair outside of MY MORNING GAL early, continued to track in range two wide on the turn, was driven between horses into
the lane, came up empty and was only shown the crop a few times without being otherwise urged late.

MARK OF THE Z pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, continued to duel for the lead from the two path around the turn, pulled clear
passing the eighth pole and was kept to the task to the wire. OMAR ATTACK bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the
pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path approaching the three eighths pole, bore in and brushed with EXPROMPT near the
quarter pole and gained ground on the outside in late stretch. EXPROMPT (FR) raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around
the turn was forced to steady when OMAR ATTACK bore in and brushed with him near the quarter pole, recovered to run on in upper stretch and gained
ground between horses with a late surge in the final strides. TOUGH STUFF dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn,
continued to race in contention on the rail in upper stretch and weakened late. I'M CORFU pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dropped
back slightly while racing in the two path around the turn, launched a second bid entering the stretch and was outkicked while drifting out mildly in the final
furlong. HERE COMES KYLE was away from the gate slowly, trailed the field on the inside in the opening stages, began to move up from the two path
around the turn and continued to pass tiring horses in the stretch. DEMAND RANSOM raced between horses in the middle of the pack early, saved ground
around the turn and finished evenly while never threatening. LIBERAL LUNACY chased the frontrunners from the outside up the backstretch, navigated the
turn from the two path, dropped back entering the stretch and was outmatched from there. SUSPECT settled behind the leaders for the run up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn, ran into mild traffic near the three sixteenths pole and continued to fade through the final furlong. GLACKEN'S
GHOST raced at the back of the pack the entire way around the oval and, despite saving ground throughout was never a factor. ROYAL COMMISH raced
off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two and three paths, and offered no bid. TODDLES bumped with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and was never a factor. AN OBJECTION
WAS FILED BY THE RIDER OF EXPROMPT, CITING INTERFERENCE FROM THE RIDER OF OMAR ATTACK, REGARDING THE INCIDENT NEAR
THE QUARTER POLE. AFTER REVIEWING THE REPLAY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALFIED OMAR ATTACK AND PLACED HIM THIRD FOR
INTERFERENCE.

Footnotes
KIPPER DOODLE was sent to the lead while racing keenly early, set the pace in the two path on the turn, was pushed along in upper stretch, and drew off
while kept to the task. THAT LUVIN FEELING broke outward, tracked the leading pair inside of VALIANT LADY early, saved ground behind the leading pair,
came into the lane under a drive inside, proved no match for the leader but battled on second best. COUNTRY ASSETS stumbled in the opening strides,
settled at the rear, raced three wide in the rear flight on the turn, swung out and rallied seven wide under a drive in the lane, and narrowly missed the place.
MORA VALLEY was reluctant to load, tracked outside the leader, applied mild two-wide pressure on the turn, was driven two wide in upper stretch while no
match for the leader, and outfinished in the final furlong. DUSTY MILLER was squeezed back in the opening strides, improved inside past the eleven
sixteenths, raced keenly midpack along the inside into the turn, raced in the two to three path on the turn, was taken inside into the lane, improved under a
drive in upper stretch but flattened out late. ORDAINED KISS chased behind the tracking flight down the backstretch, continued to chase midpack in the four
path on the turn, raced three to four wide into the stretch, and kept on without finding the necessary kick to contend for the place. SINGING ALLI settled
near the rear, raced between horses in the rear flight on the turn, rallied into the lane, was caught behind traffic in upper stretch, altered out five wide, and
continued to improve willingly. VALIANT LADY tracked the leading pair between horses, steadied approaching the seven sixteenths and was taken back
toward the rear, raced at the inside of the rear flight on the turn, and passed inside tiring horses in the lane. BRECHIN'S COMMAND chased to the far
outside down the backstretch, improved to track the leading pair five wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the lane, and flattened out. DANCE chased
toward the rear between horses down the backstretch, raced with the rear flight three wide on the turn, and had no rally seven to eight wide in the lane.
PROBABLY GRACE chased between horses, briefly improved to track between horses into the turn, raced in range four wide on the bend, and weakened
four wide from upper stretch. VEGAN GOES BEST tracked the leading pair three wide, weakened under a drive in the three path on the turn, and had
nothing further for the drive.

CANDY STORE raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, angled in to save ground around the far
turn, began his bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, took command at the eighth pole and continued to draw off to the wire. MARKET ANALYSIS raced in
the two path around the first turn, led the field under a hold up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path, was caught with a furlong to go
and finished well to hold second. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE chased the leader from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up to
challenge approaching the three eighths pole, entered the stretch from the three path and was outkicked in the final furlong. EXEMPLAR raced in the three
path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the outside, angled in to save ground around the far turn, and made a
mild gain of ground on the inside in the stretch. FULL OF RUN saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the far turn, began gaining ground entering the stretch and continued to pass tiring horses to the wire. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER raced in the four

Footnotes
CAROLINA BEAST tracked the pace outside the leading pair, continued three wide in range on the turn, rallied to the lead outside of SHE'S HONORABLE
past the three sixteenths under hand urging, and drew off under a hand ride while being shown the crop. LOGI chased behind the leading trio inside of
TEMRIK, continued well behind the leading trio in the four path on the turn, was driven four wide in upper stretch, and stayed on under a drive to prove best
of the rest. WILDWOOD MAGGIE settled near the rear between horses, continued two wide toward the rear on the turn, rallied two to three wide in upper
stretch, ran into traffic near the furlong mark, angled out, and found her best stride late. SHE'S HONORABLE set the early pace while being pressed by
PROMISES KEPT early, edged clear into the turn, drifted out in upper stretch when driven on a narrow lead, proved no match once headed by CAROLINA
BEAST past the three sixteenths, and flattened out inside. AMAZING ANNIE settled near the rear inside, chased while saving ground around the turn,
improved position two wide in upper stretch, but was outfinished for the place. POLAR'S GRACE settled toward the rear outside, raced three wide toward
the rear on the turn, was taken six wide into upper stretch, and rallied belatedly outside. TEMRIK chased behind the leading trio outside of LOGI early,
continued to chase in the five path on the turn, came five wide into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. MS KELA TIME settled at the rear, raced at the
inside of the second-last pair on the turn, was taken four wide into upper stretch, chased on under a drive but was outfinished. PROMISES KEPT pressed
the pace outside of SHE'S HONORABLE on the backstretch, tracked between horses on the turn, and weakened between horses in the lane. HOLD THE
SPENDING settled near the rear three wide, raced in the three path in the rear pair on the turn, swung out into the lane, and took closer order four to five
wide in the lane under a drive. HENRYS GIRL stumbled at the start, unseated her jockey, completed the course without a rider, was apprehended on the
gallop out and walked off.
