Footnotes
CAPITAL HEAT quickest from the start, set the pace inside, inched away into the turn, entered the stretch two wide, urged right-handed in the lane and held
safely. MY TIGRESS chased outside a rival, three wide into the stretch, took aim at the leader in the drive but lacked the needed late punch. ENVY stalked
two wide through the turn and stayed on for a clear third. SHEZ OUR ARCH unhurried in the early going, raced three wide while outside a rival into the turn,
floated out by that foe into the stretch, then improved position. MAJESTIC MOUNTAIN chased from inside to the lane and weakened. TROPHY CHEST
bumped in the hind-quarters leaving the gate, went two wide into the turn, came out into the stretch and was never a factor. BETTY'S BAMBINA broke in
and bumped rival, trailed the field early and angled over to the inside quickly, went two wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
C FALLS sped clear in the two path, inched away on the backstretch, took the far turn two then three wide, urged right-handed and drew away then in hand
nearing the wire. DIRECT LINE forwardly placed outside the speed, coaxed at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the drive and settled for
second best. JUROR off slow to begin, went three to four wide around the first turn, remained off the rail to the stretch and was along for the show. FIRE
POLISH tracked off the inside, angled in on the second turn and could not rally. MY INDY chased inside then went up inside to press the leader briefly at the
three-quarter pole, chased from inside to the far turn then angled three wide into the lane, drifted inward near the three-sixteenths pole and tired.

Footnotes
BRUJA ESCARLATA set the pace inside, led clear under a confident ride into the stretch, drew away in the lane and held safely late. LITTLE RACHEL
bumped at the start, dropped back early, advanced three to four wide around the turn, drifted inward through the stretch and finished well. WICKS AND
CHAPPIES attended the pace four deep early, dropped back a bit to chase, angled in on the turn, saved ground into the lane and bested the rest. STAR
KISSED chased three wide through the turn and never produced a bid. NAANSENSE raced off the pace, entered the turn along the inside, moved a bit off
the rail into the stretch, came out in the drive and never threatened. SWEET SONNY up close outside the leader, chased two wide into the lane and
weakened. COCOA CENTS stumbled and bumped leaving the gate, entered the turn two wide, exited three wide into the lane and proved no menace.

Footnotes
TAKE A LEAP stalked between rivals on the first turn, went up to press from outside on the backstretch, dueled with INVINCIBELLA around the far turn and
into the lane, cleared rival mid-stretch then held over the runner-up. MESO broke in and bumped leaving the gate, pressed from inside to the five-eighths
pole then chased to the far turn, remained inside to the stretch, then finished well and came back to prove a game second. INVINCIBELLA (GB) assumed
command quickly, set the pace under pressure from the inside then challenged from the outside to the far turn, dueled with TAKE A LEAP and was
outfinished in the late stages. PERFECT ICE STORM went three to four wide around both turns, angled out in the stretch and improved position.
SPLASHING knocked into rival at the start, chased off the inside, four wide into the lane and weakened. MADAME BARBARIAN bumped by outside rival in
the beginning, settled along the inside, saved ground then tipped out into the stretch and was never a factor. LUCKY MS JONES lagged behind early,
angled to the inside, saved ground to the stretch and was always outrun. MILE FRACTION HAND-TIMED.

CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE unhurried in the early stages, angled out leaving the far turn and into the stretch, rallied to the front past the eighth pole and won
going away. MISS MEGAN sped to the front in the two path, cleared into the backstretch, kicked away into the stretch, drifted out in the lane, overtaken
inside the furlong pole and stayed on to secure second. LUCKY PERIDOT raced two wide around the first turn, sat off the pace, advanced three then four
wide around the far turn, drifted to the inside in the lane and closed in on the top pair but flattened out in deep stretch. LAVENDER (IRE) stumbled at the
start, was unhurried early on off the inside, came four wide into the stretch and showed a mild response to gain a minor award. PAID INFORMANT chased
the leader from between rivals, two wide into the stretch and failed to find the needed response. PRINCESS MO went three wide around the first turn, in
range outside a pair of rivals up the backstretch, chased three wide into the lane and weakened. MATERA tracked off the rail, three wide into the far turn,
moved out and entered the stretch five wide and weakened. NOVELLA showed early speed and angled to the inside, chased the leader inside a pair of
rivals up the backstretch, lost ground around the far turn and tired. TIZ WONDERFULLY settled in the two path and had little left for the drive. GOLDEN IRIS

SENSIBLE CAT bumped leaving the gate, went four then three wide around the first turn, sat off the pace while off the rail, split foes at the seven-sixteenths
marker, exited the far turn four wide, rallied and reeled in DYLANS WILD CAT then drew clear. GOVERNOR GOTEVEN went five then four wide on the first
turn, settled off the pace, entered the far turn four wide, angled out and came six wide into the stretch and got up for the place. DYLANS WILD CAT stalked
off the rail, closed in around the far turn, bid outside the leader at the quarter pole, took control then cleared rival, challenged in the late stages and yielded
to the top pair. I'M SO ANNA traveled five then four wide around the first turn, stayed off the inside then swung out into the stretch, finished willingly and
earned a minor award. SUPER GAME tracked a bit off the rail into the drive and finished evenly. MUCHA WOMAN sped clear from inside, came off the rail
into the lane, collared by rival in upper stretch and gave way. WILL TAKE A KISS bumped leaving the gate, raced a bit greenly into and around the first turn,
saved ground into the stretch and was never a factor. MISS GLORIOUS bumped at the start, traveled six then five wide around the clubhouse turn, came
five wide into the stretch and faded. WESTWARD BREEZE broke in and got sandwiched between rivals, took the first turn four wide, exited the far turn
three wide and was not persevered with late. LOVE WINS veered in and bumped rival at the start, traveled five wide into the first turn, four wide into the
stretch, drifted out in the lane and never threatened.

Footnotes
RATE FOR ME bumped leaving the gate, went three wide around the first turn, angled in on the backstretch, saved ground into the lane, rallied along the
fence, kicked clear and held safely late. BLAME IT ON KITTY bit tight between rivals at the start, tucked inside on the first turn then moved off the rail,
angled four wide into the stretch, rallied between foes through the lane and earned the place honors. LITTLE NO WAY tracked off the rail then outside a pair
of rivals on the backstretch, ranged up five wide into the lane, lacked the needed late punch to threaten the winner but gained the show. WILL DANCER
broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, prompted the pace from inside, challenged inside rivals and vied for the lead around the far turn, drew clear in
upper stretch while moving off the inside, lost command mid-stretch and got edged for third. SIX POINT RACK stalked the pace from inside, two wide in
upper stretch and never produced a bid. BITTER RING HOME had early speed in the two path on the first turn then stalked the top trio into the backstretch,
kept off the rail to the lane, lacked room in upper stretch, angled to the outside but could not summon the needed rally. MAXINAMILLION mid-pack in the
early going, went four wide into the far turn, six wide into the stretch and flattened out. PLAYING THROUGH pressed the pace three deep, challenged
around the far turn then gave way. MR. ESKEN set the pace between rivals then vied with foes around the final turn and weakened in the lane. PUNALUU
went three wide around the clubhouse turn, settled off the pace, angled to the rail, was done early and eased in the stretch across the wire, then walked off
following the race.
