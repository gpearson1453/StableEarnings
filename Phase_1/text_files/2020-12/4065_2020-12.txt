Footnotes
SKYVALUE went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace inside to the two path, responded well when set down in upper stretch and proved much
the best under strong urging. BELLA BELLE raced in the two path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, chased the winner in the two path on the
far turn, pursued that foe under a drive into upper stretch and proved no match while able to hold the place. TUPELO HON E went around the first turn in
the two path, settled towards the rear, was urged along while three wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response while just up for the show. LADY
MCKENZIE went three wide on the first turn, tugged hard at the bit while keen onto the backstretch, was rated on the outside, came under urging while
three wide on the far turn and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. OVER THE BLUES broke out at the start, became rank under tight
restraint early, came out into the first turn then dropped to the two path, continued to tug hard at the bit onto the backstretch, was reserved near the inside,
came under urging along the rail on the far turn and also failed to rally. NAVY REGATTA broke out at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled on
the outside, was roused three wide on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. KRAFT'S RATE was rated just off the
pace on the inside, dropped back with a half-mile to run, fell further back into the far turn, saved ground on that bend, came out into the stretch and failed to
respond. SCOOTIN BAYOU was slowest into stride then sluggish early, lagged at the rear while saving ground and trailed. (Rail at 20 Feet)

under lighter encouragement late. LAST TO KNOW was reluctant to load, broke a half-step slow, dropped well behind while void of speed, saved ground on
the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, angled in near the furlong marker and finished full of run but was too late while well clear for the place.
NOSY BANKER moved up then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, drifted in over heels just after turning into the stretch,
moved out while still on his inside lead around the three-sixteenths, pursued the winner while continuing on his inside lead into the final furlong and
weakened. COFFEE COUNTY was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, settled well off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, swung five
wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CATINANDSCATIN settled under some urging, traveled around the turn in the two path, turned into
upper stretch under a drive and failed to rally. GUILTY AS CHARGED was well placed just off the pace, dropped back while inside on the turn and
capitulated. FRIENDOFTHECOURT chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn and tired. JADE'S CLASSY ONE was urged along while

Footnotes
STELLA'S SURPRISE bumped solidly with a rival at the start, angled in quickly while going to the front, vied in the two path on the turn, shook clear at the
five-sixteenths, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch and drew off under strong urging. SUCRE was taken in hand early then well placed
just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came out into upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed whip outside the furlong marker, was switched to a
right-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole then drifted in and safely secured the place. FLAT OUT BIG MONEY settled well off the pace, was urged three
wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in around the three-sixteenths and improved position to just get the show. CHERRY TWIST
bumped solidly with a foe at the start, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch, drifted in near the furlong
marker and came up empty. LIL ALLIE DANCER chased the pace on the outside then five wide on the turn and came up empty. ACTIVE GIRL was off slow
and spotted the front a few lengths, raced outside while urged along, went four wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
KEHRON'S CREED moved up under urging to press the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, dropped back inside the five-sixteenths
and faded. CALLMEONMYCELLFONE broke in and bumped with a rival while off a step slow, started the turn in the two path, shifted four then five wide
later on that bend and was no factor. MONARCHOS PRAYER chased the pace, went four wide on the turn and capitulated. SAINTS' GIRL bumped with a
rival while off a step slow, saved ground near the back and failed to respond. TIZ THE STORM was urged along off the pace, dropped back in the two path
on the turn and faltered.
