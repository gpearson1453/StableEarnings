Footnotes
HALF AGAIN was reluctant to load, broke in but was quickly corrected by the rider, was carried in by SOUL SONG early, moved out behind that rival then
tracked the pace, went three wide on the turn, chased into upper stretch, bumped with ROSE'S GALAXY outside the furlong marker then came under a
right-handed whip, rallied to the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear in the final sixteenth under a hand ride. SOUL SONG broke in then was
hustled to the lead, angled in towards the rail and put PALVERA in tight quarters, controlled the tempo while inside through the turn, was asked once
straightened for the drive, came under the whip inside the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while just able
to get the place. ROSE'S GALAXY jostled with a rival while taken up badly at the start, spotted the front several lengths, settled on the outside, moved
closer with a half-mile to run, was urged four wide on the turn, bumped with the winner outside the furlong marker, chased that foe into the final sixteenth
and was out-kicked then just missed the place. PALVERA broke out then was hustled, steadied while put in tight against the rail near the nine-sixteenths
then moved out, chased in the two path on the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. ADRENALINE was fractious in the
gate, checked badly while jostling with a foe at the start, moved up while in hand nearing the half-mile pole, dropped back while inside on the turn, came
under the whip in upper stretch and failed to respond.

the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into the stretch under the whip, pursued the winner under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear
for the place. GIFTED TALENT was squeezed back along the rail early, saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear, went two then three wide on

Footnotes
SEVEN SCENTS tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the turn, wheeled five wide into the stretch, rallied to the lead in the center of
the course entering the final furlong then moved clear under steady handling. HILTON MAGIC showed good speed and set the clear pace, raced inside on
the turn, cruised into upper stretch, was asked for his best inside the three-sixteenths lost the advantage to the winner near the furlong marker and was
outfinished but held the place. STAR OF KODIAK bumped four times with DOWSE'S BEACH on the backstretch, was rated under a tight hold between
horses, continued under tight restraint between horses in the two path on the turn, was asked once straightened for the drive and finished willingly for the
show. FUTURE RULER dropped to the rear of the field, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, swung nine wide into upper stretch and
lacked the needed kick. WESTERN TROUBLE broke out and a step slow, moved up on the outside, was urged three wide on the turn then carried six wide
into the stretch and weakened. DOWSE'S BEACH bumped four times with STAR OF KODIAK on the backstretch, dropped back into the turn, saved ground
on that bend, turned into the stretch in the two path, drifted out inside the three-sixteenths and failed to respond. (Rail at 20 Feet)

prevailed while drifting out late under strong urging. KILLEEN went around the first turn in the two path, settled in third position, raced inside early on the far
turn then shifted three wide, gained four wide into upper stretch, made an outside bid near the furlong marker but was turned away and settled for the place.
OVERZEALOUS went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused while four then five wide on the far turn, gained six wide into the stretch,
chased into the final furlong and was out-kicked while able to get the show. ORIGINAL INTENT went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was
urged along while five then four wide on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch, moved out around the three-sixteenths and finished willingly.
HALF TRICK bumped lightly with a rival at the start, raced in the three path on the first turn, settled in second position while far behind the leader, moved
closer while three then four wide on the far turn, was carried five wide into the stretch and came up empty. DREAM HALO went four wide on the first turn,
settled well off the pace, was asked in the two path on the far turn and failed to respond. GATO AMERICANO bobbled at the start then bumped lightly with a
foe, went three to four wide on the first turn, lagged at the rear, went around the far turn in the two path and failed to threaten. CITALI saved ground while

LUVIN BULLIES settled off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, rallied between horses into the final
furlong, closed determinedly into the final sixteenth, made a bid late and won the head-bob on the wire. STERLING MISS settled at the rear of the field, was
urged four wide on the turn then swung six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed strongly to get the lead late but was out-nodded
and denied on the wire. WHIMSICAL MUSE broke a bit awkwardly then brushed with a foe, settled towards the rear, passed the seven-sixteenths under
some restraint, went four then three wide on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole, angled out inside the three-sixteenths then bumped BYE BYE BERTIE
twice outside the eighth-pole, rallied into the final furlong and finished fast to just miss while narrowly able to get the show. LILLIE DELL showed speed on
the outside then moved clear inside the half-mile pole, controlled the action while inside on the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch, was asked inside the
three-sixteenths, extended the advantage into the final furlong, remained clear into the final sixteenth but was caught. MOM'S RED LIPSTICK smashed
through the front of the gate prior to the start but was nicely held onto by the assistant starter as he was dragged to the ground, settled off the pace, raced
inside for most of the turn then shifted to the two path, moved out inside the three-sixteenths then drifted out into the final furlong and lacked the needed
kick. BYE BYE BERTIE settled outside under some urging, was ridden along while three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, was bumped twice
by WHIMSICAL MUSE outside the furlong marker then steadied between horses, regained stride outside the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly. COBRA
CASABLANCA showed speed then dropped back inside the half-mile pole, raced inside to the two path on the turn, chased the leader under a drive into the
final furlong and weakened. SPECIALLY brushed with a rival at the start, settled on the outside, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch
and lacked the needed response. YES IT'S GINGER broke through the front of the gate after a neighboring rival did the same but remained in the stall,
showed speed between horses then dropped off the pace, chased in the three path on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final
furlong and came up empty. (Rail at 20 Feet)
