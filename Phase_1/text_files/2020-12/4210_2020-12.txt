Footnotes
GEOCAS STREET broke out and went to the front from along the inside, had to deal with pressure from CHIEF EAGLE EYE on the backstretch, continued
pressured lead through the turn and into the stretch, met bid of rival in the stretch and prevailed gamely. CHIEF EAGLE EYE vied outside of leader on the
backstretch, entered turn two wide and pressing leader through the turn, took aim on leader in the stretch and denied by winner. GOBOLDLY stalked
contested pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued to stay along the rail through the turn and into the backstretch, lacked need response to gain
on leaders but bested rest of field. MALIBU MAGIC stalked pace three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide through the turn and into the stretch,
entered stretch three wide and lacked needed rally. ZINZAN off slow and lost about two lengths at the start, recovered to stalk pace in between rivals on the
backstretch, entered turn two wide and continued two wide into the stretch, lacked response in the stretch and gave way. STAY LEGENDARY broke clean
and dropped back before they left the chute, trailed by many on the backstretch and never asked or involved at any point.

two path, overtaken in deep stretch but held off other closers for second. TWO BILLS bumped at the start, chased leader along the inside, entered turn
along the rail, eased out in the stretch and in range, denied by leader for second late. SHARED bumped start and chased two wide on the backstretch,
entered turn two wide and eased out into the four path in the stretch, kept on well and held position in the stretch. UNSTOPPABLE GUY broke well, but took
the worst of it when EDDIE EAGLE came in and bumped rival causing a chain reaction, bumped and steadied back, stalked in between rivals on the
backstretch, entered stretch in the two path and gained mildly in the stretch. EDDIE EAGLE came in and bumped SHARED causing a chain reaction of
bumping, tracked leader two wide on the backstretch and three wide on the turn, lacked needed response in the stretch while angling to the rail. DAVE'S
