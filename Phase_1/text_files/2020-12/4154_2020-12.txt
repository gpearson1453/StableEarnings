Footnotes
MOBJACK dueled outside of JACK COOL on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and into the stretch two wide, kicked clear in upper stretch, and held off
late rally by rival. UP TIME tracked dueling leaders two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and into the stretch in the three path, took aim on
leader and kept on gaining ground to the wire. JACK COOL dueled inside of MOBJACK for the lead in a contested pace, entered turn along the inside and
into the stretch, kept on in the stretch while unable to match strides with winner, but held on for third. BOISTEROUS RASCAL chased pacesetters along the
inside on the backstretch, continued along the rail into the turn and into the stretch, angled out approaching the sixteenth pole and briefly had to wait for
room, kept to task in deep stretch and edged out for third placing at the wire. EVER FOR EVER EVER bumped at the start by FAST GALLITO, stalked pace
along the inside, continued along the inside through the turn and into the stretch, unable to launch a rally in the stretch when asked. FAST GALLITO broke
out and bumped rival at the start, stalked leaders two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, fanned for wide late on the turn while attempting to
launch a bid, and came up empty in the stretch. DESERT MOVIE tracked leaders three wide on the backstretch, entered turn three wide and began fading
late in the turn, and failed to threaten in the stretch.
