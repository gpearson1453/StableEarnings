Footnotes
MARTINI BLU tracked kindly in the pocket, switched out near the three eighths, encroached outside of DREAM KEEPER while under his own power, was
shaken up in upper stretch and took over from the three sixteenths, drew off under a drive, and was wrapped up past the sixteenth pole when well clear.
DREAM KEEPER sent to the lead, raced keenly into the backstretch, continued to set the pace in the two path on the far turn, was confronted by MARTINI
BLUE past the five sixteenths, could not match him from the three sixteenths, switched out midstretch, and was put in hand late when clear for second.
MKAR THE FAST reared in the gate, chased the leading trio, was pushed for a bid into the far turn, saved ground through that bend, swung three wide into
the lane, could not threaten the top two but chased on to prove best of the rest. ROCKET HOTSHOT broke inward and bumped FLASHY RICHIE in the
opening strides, settled inside, took closer order down the backstretch, improved two wide on the far turn, kept on under a drive in the lane but could not reel
MKAR THE FAST in for the show. TWO COOKIE RULE chased midpack while saving ground, turned for home under a drive inside, but lacked the needed
rally. FLASHY RICHIE was bumped by ROCKET HOTSHOT in the opening strides, settled midpack, continued two wide down the backstretch, raced in the
two to three path on the turn, and had no rally in the lane. FANCY EMPRESS raced three wide midpack into the clubhouse turn, settled back toward the
rear around that bend, raced two wide win the rear flight down the backstretch, continued in the three path in the rear flight on the far turn, was driven three
wide in upper stretch and passed tiring horses. MIKE'S LADY settled at the rear, raced at the inside of the rear flight through the backstretch and while
saving ground through the far turn, and offered no rally inside in the lane. DECEITFUL ANTHONY raced keen into the first turn, tracked the pace two wide,
stopped near the seven sixteenths, faded three wide on the far turn and was no further factor in the lane.

Footnotes
RUNNINGFROMTHEFEDS had a comfortable lead on the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground throughout and kicked clear in the stretch,
much the best. MR. LUV MAKER tucked in behind the leader to save ground around the first turn, continued to stalk that rival on the inside for the run up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. FORGOT TO FORGET raced in the two path around
the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the inside in the middle of the pack, saved ground around the far turn and improved position on the rail in the
stretch while never threatening the top two. HIDE THE EVIDENCE saved ground around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack up the backstretch,
continued to save ground around the far turn, gained ground mildly in the stretch and was outfinished. SWITHERAL angled in sharply to race in the two path
around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, made a mild bid from the three path around the far turn and was outkicked from there. TWO PAIR
raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path and tired in the
final furlong. NORCO raced in the three path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, continued around the
far turn in the two path and made no bid. MIDNIGHT JOKER raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the
pack, began to drop back headed into the far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MAY WE ALL tracked in the pocket behind the leader, saved ground through the turn, pushed two wide past the three sixteenths, split horses, drove to the
lead past the furlong mark and cleared. TRAPPE VALLEY chased behind the tracking flight, continued in the two to three path behind that line around the
clubhouse turn, remained behind traffic in upper stretch, got through horses two wide past the furlong mark, and ran on for the place. SHANGHAI POINT
was hustled through horses to make the early lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, was headed past the furlong
pole by the winner, proved no match, flattened out late but salvaged the show. BORDINI settled two wide toward the rear early, was urged into the turn,
raced in the three path around that bend, went to a drive from near the rear three to four wide in upper stretch, was taken out further, and rallied mildly six to
seven wide. MARK OF THE Z tracked the leader outside of MAY WE ALL, was urged to gain on the leader past the five sixteenths, came into the lane
between horses, stayed on in range between horses two to three wide, lacked the needed kick and flattened out late. ROYAL COMMISSION was bumped
soundly by SERTOMAN in the opening strides, chased midpack, was urged in the four to five path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, and flattened
out five wide in the final furlong. DEACON was slowly away after having his head turned at the break, settled near the rear inside, saved ground through the
turn and into upper stretch, and offered no rally. ONE WAY HOME chased outside of TRAPPE VALLEY early, bid three wide on the turn, was driven three
wide into the lane, and weakened four wide. SERTOMAN broke out and bumped ROYAL COMMISSION in the opening strides, settled at the rear, trailed in
the four path on the turn, swung six wide for the drive, and had no bid.

Footnotes
R H SMOAKEM chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, launched a bid from the rail passing the quarter
pole, kicked clear with a furlong to go and held on for the win after drifting out in late stretch. MINISTER'S GLORY brushed with the horse to his inside
leaving the gate, settled in midpack for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, swung out in upper stretch to find room, began his bid
nearing the three sixteenths pole and gained ground quickly on the outside from there. ITSALLABOUTYOU chased the leaders on the outside through the
opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the three path approaching the three eighths pole, continued to improve position in upper stretch and finished
well. STRIKING HEIR pressed the pace from the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, continued to race in striking position in
upper stretch and finished evenly. MIND TRAPPE bobbled and bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to press the pace on the
outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, dueled in upper stretch and weakened between horses
in the final furlong. PRESIDENT ELECT brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the inside in the opening stages, came
around the turn in the two path, made a mild gain of ground in upper stretch and was outkicked from there. YABA DABA DOO chased the leaders between
horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and made no bid. KARA'S ANGEL bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate,
was hustled to lead between horses for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the final furlong. SUNNY'S STORM raced in
the middle of the pack between horses early, came around the turn in the two path and was empty in the stretch. FOUR LEFT FEET raced in the middle of
the pack on the outside up the backstretch, offered a mild bid from the three path while racing around the turn and flattened out in the stretch. COLOMBARD
raced at the back of the pack the entire way around the oval, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor. SATURDAYS HANGOVER was away
from the gate slowly, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was never involved.

MY MISS MARILYN tracked outside of BOBBIE TOO TOO, increased the pressure through the turn, took the lead approaching the furlong mark and drove
clear. BOBBIE TOO TOO set the pace inside of MY MISS MARILYN, took increased pressure on the turn, clung to a narrow lead into the lane, proved no
match from midstretch but held the place. LILLET settled toward the rear, took closer order while saving ground around the turn and into the lane, was taken
three wide in upper stretch, rallied with good interest and narrowly missed the place. HENRYS GIRL tracked the leading pair inside of SAINT ALEXIUS, was
pushed along in the three path on the turn behind the leading pair, proved no match for them into the lane, flattened out in the final furlong but still held for a
minor award. LADY MAGNA chased outside of TALLY UP on the backstretch, was urged in the four path on the turn, went to a drive three wide in upper
stretch, and kept on evenly late. PALETTE hopped at the break, settled near the rear inside foes early, continued toward the rear in the two to three path on
the turn, responded to a drive in upper stretch, and offered a mild four wide rally. TALLY UP came out in the opening strides and bumped BLANCO BRUSH,
chased midpack, was urged in the three path on the turn, came into the lane two wide and flattened out. BLANCO BRUSH was awkwardly away, took back
when bumped between horses in the opening strides, settled near the rear, raced in the three path on the turn at the outside of the rear flight, saved ground
into the lane and passed tiring horses. SAINT ALEXIUS tracked the leading pair two wide, continued in range in the four path on the turn, came up empty in
upper stretch and gradually faded. EADS BRIDGE raced outside the tracking flight early, chased in the six path on the turn and weakened four to five wide
in the lane. DONTOUCHTHATDIAL settled at the rear, raced in the two path on the turn, came into the lane between horses and had no rally. FILLY FROM
ILLY bumped with BLANCO BRUSH in the opening strides, chased between the main group and the rear group early, faded in the five path on the turn and
had no more for the drive.

PLEASANT MOON raced in the two path around the first turn, continued to duel for the lead on the outside up the backstretch and around the far turn,
refused to yield down the lane and gamely pulled clear in the final strides. DIAMOND DAVE bobbled leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn,
raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and
gained ground quickly on the inside late. IOWA NATIVE saved ground around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued
to contest for the lead around the far turn and into the stretch, drifted out in the final furlong and gave way late. BEAR TRAPPE raced off the pace in the two
path through the opening half mile, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole and continued to gain ground on the outside in the stretch.
ANTRIM'S GIANT saved ground around the first turn, chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and
was outkicked in the stretch. HALF OF MANHATTAN raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the frontrunners on the outside up the
backstretch, angled in to save ground around the second turn and weakened in the stretch. PENTIMENTO raced in the two path in the middle of the pack
through the opening half mile, began to move up slightly from the two path around the turn and flattened out in the stretch. PISTOL BOX trailed the field
from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, swung wide around the far turn, entered the stretch in the four path and passed tiring horses
from there. JUSTENUFFTUFF raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, navigated the far turn
from the three path and faded in the final furlong. TURFMEISTER was squeezed back leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack through the opening
half mile, came around the far turn in the three path and made no bid. ZANFORCE chased the leader from the four path around the first turn, raced between

Footnotes
I'M CORFU rated well when placed on the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, and drew off in the two path in the lane without ever being asked.
LOST IN MANHATTAN tracked the pacesetter outside of STALLONE down the backstretch, stalked in the three path on the turn, proved no match for the
leader into the lane, kept on under a drive two wide, and edged clear for place in the final sixteenth. STALLONE tracked the pacesetter inside of LOST IN
MANHATTAN early, hugged the rail in the pocket on the turn, proved no match for the leader into the lane, kept on under a drive until flattening out in the
final sixteenth. AMERICAN HERITAGE bobbled into stride, chased inside of EL ASESINO early, continued midpack in the two to three path on the turn,
swung out and chased four wide in the lane, and could not get to the tracking pair despite an all-out drive. EL ASESINO chased outside of AMERICAN
HERITAGE early, kept on in the four path on the turn, went to a drive approaching the five sixteenths, swung out and continued under a drive five wide in
the lane, but lacked the needed kick. ANDREW THE GIANT settled at the rear, trailed while hugging the rail around the turn, began to rally past the five
sixteenths, and kept on inside under a drive. MEXICO MEMORIES came in and bumped DEMAND RANSOM in the opening strides, settled toward the rear
inside of MIAS MOONBEAM, raced in the three path on the turn, swung out six wide in upper stretch and went to a drive, and lacked the needed kick.
DEMAND RANSOM was bumped in the hind end by MEXICO MEMORIES in the opening strides, was taken back to chase midpack, weakened in the five
path on the turn, went to a drive between horses in upper stretch and offered no response. MIAS MOONBEAM settled toward the rear, raced in the six path
on the turn, floated into the lane in the eight path and came up empty.

Footnotes
STURGILL was sent for pace, got to the lead approaching the five eighths pole inside of MEDAL OF FACT, raced clear while saving ground through the
turn, and held the field at bay under a drive in the lane despite drifting out. CHANGE DIRECTION chased the leading pair inside of RIVER FINN, advanced
to track the pace while saving ground through the turn, went to a drive behind the pacesetter in upper stretch, kept on willingly but could not cut into the
winner's advantage. MARKET ANALYSIS settled two wide toward the rear of the main pack, inched forward four wide approaching the half, chased in the
four path on the turn, dropped to the inside approaching the turn for home, was in tight between RIVER FINN and the rail near the quarter, and rallied under
a drive inside. MEDAL OF FACT was sent for pace, led until passed by STURGILL to his inside approaching the five eighths, tracked the new pacesetter
two wide on the turn, proved no match for the leading pair into the lane, and gradually flattened. TODDLES was bumped by RIVER FINN in the opening
strides, settled inside of MARKET ANALYSIS near the rear of the main group on the backstretch, inched forward past the seven sixteenths, raced at the
inside of the chasing flight around the bend, swung three wide into the lane, went to a drive, and lacked the needed kick. PRINCE ABUBU settled at the rear
of the main group, was driven in the two path on the turn, continued under a drive inside into upper stretch, passed tiring horses in upper stretch but
ultimately lacked enough of a rally to be a threat. RIVER FINN broke out and bumped TODDLES in the opening strides, chased the leading pair between
horses, put MARKET ANALYSIS in tight in upper stretch while turning for home to hit outside, and flattened out. UPHAM chased the leading pair three wide,
continued three wide in the chasing flight on the turn, was put to a drive past the three eighths, offered no response, and faded in the six path in the lane.
HIGH SPIRITS hit the gate, soon trailed, kept on in the two to three path on the turn while detached from the field, floated into the lane in the six path and
offered no bid.

frontrunner down the lane, pulling clear late. CRANKSHAFT led the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, continued to show the way in
upper stretch and was caught in the final sixteenth of a mile. JUST RUN raced off the pace on the outside, began a bid from the rail approaching the three
eighths pole, chased the eventual winner home and proved to be no match for the top two. HAUNTED MESA trailed the field on the outside early, angled in
to save ground around the turn and improved position from the rail in late stretch. TORNADO BOY trailed the field on the inside in the opening stages,
saved ground around the turn and made a mild gain of ground in the stretch. AZUSA ST. chased the frontrunner on the inside up the backstretch, navigated
the turn from the two path and finished evenly. B SALTY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, made a mild bid while racing in the two path
around the turn and faded in the final furlong. CREAL WONDER pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved in to save ground around the
turn and weakened in the stretch. TIZ TOO MUCH hopped up leaving the gate, raced between horses in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter
of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path and was empty in the stretch. W W RUSSIAN GOLD raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and tired from there. GUARD YOUR GRILL stumbled leaving the gate, settled in in the middle of the pack
on the inside for the run up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was never a factor. L' CRISTABAL raced off the pace on the outside
up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, was pulled up by his rider in upper stretch and vanned off.
