Footnotes
NICOLE PRINCESS vied outside FIFTH ILLUSION early, moved clear entering the turn in the two-path, widened into upper stretch and was driving to
maintain a comfortable margin. GAGA OH LA LA tracked the leaders three wide to the stretch, and finished with good energy to be clearly second best.
FACTS ONLY broke out bumping COTTONS LAST, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and had the rider drop the whip a furlong out, and
salvaged the show while drifting out. KERIK was outrun to the stretch, and passed tired horses. BABY ANA advanced mildly after three furlongs, but
flattened out in mid stretch. MELLOW GOLD was no factor three wide. LUCI BREEZE was sent from the gate, and saved ground to no avail. COTTONS
LAST got bumped by FACTS ONLY and steadied back at the break, and raced far back outside. V K PRINCESS was always outrun. FIFTH ILLUSION vied
early inside the winner, moved out staying on the chase to the end of the turn, and faltered. SIERRA DIAMOND hit the left side of the gate at the start, and
was finished soon after going three furlongs. QUEEN ASHY BABY was outrun three wide.

Footnotes
EXULT was bumped between horses at the start, saved ground beginning to advance entering the far turn, swung four wide rallying into the stretch, took
over outside POOL SHARK coming to the eighth-pole and edged away under a drive. POOL SHARK sprinted clear early inside, got headed by MR
MATUSCHEK after a half-mile, battled back while drifting out to the three-path and brushing that rival at the head of the stretch, moved back inside and ran
on with good courage. SEVEN CHANNELS stayed in range near the inside to the stretch, and lacked a solid closing response. PHANTOM DANCE raced
three wide early, and failed to seriously menace. UNPOPULAR OPINION was bumped between horses at the start, raced in the two-path on the turns, and
played no part. MR MATUSCHEK prompted the pace outside POOL SHARK, reached a short lead up the backstretch, got brushed by the latter leaving the
far turn, and gave way in upper stretch. COLLIERY bumped with UNPOPULAR OPINION at the start, and was outrun inside. TRADE DEADLINE bumped
with EXULT at the start, and faded before reaching the stretch. This race was hand timed, fractional times unavailable.

LITTLE DEMON prompted the pace two wide, seized command near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. TAITA broke outwardly, raced off the pace
three wide and finished willingly to be clearly second best. BEEBOO set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner nearing the quarter pole and
weakened through the lane. FUEGO CALIENTE chased the pace two wide and lacked a rally. DIVERT saved ground to no avail. AMERICAN FLEET raced
off the pace two wide, ducked out under left-handed urging in upper stretch and was not persevered with after that. BIG CYPRESS trailed two wide.

Footnotes
R MERCEDES BOY held a short lead under pressure from both flanks for a half-mile, drifted out steadily through the stretch and edged clear all out.
SOLDOLLIE pressed the pace inside the winner and three others for a half, and ran on with good courage on the rail. PRO QUALITY was widest of a
quintet contesting the pace to the end of the turn, faded in the drive and salvaged the show. ARRIVEDERLA trailed inside to the stretch, and went by only
tired horses. GRAN CASIQUE pressed the pace between horses four wide, and tired after a half. FEAST argued the early pace between horses three wide,
and faltered into the lane.

Footnotes
MISS WROTE set a pressured pace along the rail, kicked clear nearing the lane, drifted out a bit near the sixteenth pole and held firm under right-handed
urging. GINGERONMYMIND settled off the contested pace while racing two wide around the first turn, advanced three wide around the far turn and finished
well to narrow the gap a bit in the lane. MATCHA saved ground off the pace for a half, advanced between foes around the far turn, swung out in upper
stretch and bumped KEYPIT then rallied outside. SIGNING BONUS hopped at the start, raced far back inside and rallied belatedly. OUR WEST INDY was
bumped at the start then pinched back soon after, raced two wide off the pace, angled five wide nearing the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. NEW
YORK COMMANDER was bumped at the start, saved ground well back and never threatened. SHE'S JUST QUALITY had her head turned at the start,
raced four and five wide and played no factor. KEYPIT chased the pace three and four wide, was bumped in upper stretch and faded. HOITY TOITY tracked
the pace three wide and faded nearing the lane. TRINNI GIRLS was outrun while racing four and five. FINA dueled outside of the winner for a half and
retreated.

Footnotes
VIKING QUEEN bobbled slightly after the start, raced two wide taking closer order after six furlongs, rallied determinedly and was up outside LONG BEACH
KID in the closing yards. LONG BEACH KID broke with the leaders but was reserved letting DANG IT and OUR HOISTED MAST go on with it, ranged up
two wide roused after six furlongs, took over from DANG IT and went clear staying on his left lead in upper stretch, and could not withstand the winner late.
GODS BLESSING saved ground to the far turn, moved out approaching the eighth-pole and was along for the show. DANG IT cleared to the lead and
moved inside midway on the first turn, showed the way to upper stretch, and yielded to the winner. GO MIKE bumped with OUR HOISTED MAST at the
start, raced four wide early, continued well out in the course through the middle stages, bore out badly coming off the far turn, and dropped back. FITZ'S MO
broke a length slow, and failed to menace while moving inside on the far turn. OUR HOISTED MAST prompted the early pace outside, and tired after six
furlongs. This race was hand timed, fractional times unavailable.

Footnotes
SUNNY ISLE BEACH tracked the pace three wide, churned on outside and was up in the final strides. SHINY EMPIRE set the pace along the rail, repulsed
bids and drew clear in upper stretch, remained clear to deep stretch, swished her tail in apparent resentment when whipped and led until the final strides.
BOLD ARTICLE lacked early speed inside, made a strong four wide run around the far turn but flattened out in the lane. TERRY'S DREAM failed to menace
while racing four wide. TO A T raced in range inside for a half and faded. YELLOWSTONE GIRL prompted the pace two wide and was through after a half.
FEARLESS IDEAS was outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
SOCIAL PARANOIA came out after the start forcing HAY DAKOTA into RENAISANCE FROLIC, went along unhurried in the two-path for a half-mile or so,
swung five wide getting in gear at the top of the stretch, rallied steadily and was along in time outside rivals. OLYMPIC RUNNER saved ground reserved
early, shifted out three wide coming off the far turn, bid strongly between horses in deep stretch reaching even terms for the lead, and was edged just inside
the winner. PERFECT SPEIGHTY was allowed to settle inside early, shifted to the three-path leaving the turn and finished willingly for a share. FIG JELLY
sped clear early and moved inside, stayed on to deep stretch and was overrun the last 70 yards. HAY DAKOTA was pushed into RENAISANCE FROLIC by
SOCIAL PARANOIA shortly after the start, lagged well back for a half, encountered traffic in the three-path after straightening away for the drive, shifted
further out and gained some ground without threatening. THUNDER RIDE delayed the start difficult to load, prompted the pace outside FIG JELLY to the
stretch, and gave way. EPIC DREAMER was in or around the three-path to the far turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a solid response. LOUDER
THAN BOMBS moved out four then five wide around the far turn, and made no impact. RENAISANCE FROLIC got bumped by HAY DAKOTA a few strides
from the gate and lost the rider, galloped around the course in front of the field, and was escorted off after being apprehended. THERE WAS A STEWARDS
INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AFTER THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
FLUTISTE was bumped at the start, tracked the pace from the rail, split rivals in upper stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, dueled inside of
MISSION POSSIBLE through the final furlong and prevailed. MISSION POSSIBLE rated unkindly early, raced off the pace three wide, made progress four
wide around the far turn, reached even terms near the eighth pole, dueled outside of the winner through the final furlong and just missed. BIG BAD DIVA
settled off the early pace two wide, raced at the rail around the far turn, waited briefly for room nearing the lane, swung six wide in upper stretch and rallied
for the show. BRYNBELLA raced three wide in midpack early, moved into contention four wide around the far turn, remained up close to midstretch and
weakened late. LOWER FOR LONGER (IRE) stalked the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD failed to menace while
racing two and three wide. DRIVING WIND broke a bit awkwardly and bumped the winner at the start but was still away in front, set the pace along the rail
and tired in the drive. WECALLHERQUEENMARY hit the starting gate, steadied entering the first turn, saved ground around that bend, went four wide
around the far turn and never threatened. POR QUE NO was in range three wide and tired after six furlongs. MOTHERS DAY JEWEL hit the starting gate,
saved ground and was outrun. SECRETS KEPT played no factor while racing two wide. This was hand-timed with fractions unavailable.
