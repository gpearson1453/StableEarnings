Footnotes
SILK FROM HEAVEN unhurried in the early stages, went two wide around the turn, angled in with a furlong to go, rallied along the inside and overhauled
the runner-up in the final sixteenth. LA AGUILILLA stalked outside a rival, bid outside the leader entering the stretch, kicked clear then lost command in the
final sixteenth and saved the place. FLORENTINE DIAMOND stalked the pace from inside, lost ground into the bend, angled out at the top of the lane,
finished well and missed the place. SWEET RAFAELA came out and bumped rival shortly after the start, chased two wide into the turn, angled four wide
into the lane, floated out upper stretch and kept on willingly through the final furlong. MIDNIGHT SUNRISE bumped at the start, tracked two wide around the
bend, was floated out at the top of the lane and finished evenly late. SHYLOCK EDDIE stalked three wide around the turn, angled widest in the stretch and
lacked further response. NAVY QUEEN tracked the speed along the inside, steadied into the turn, angled out around rival then back to the inside on the turn
and could not rally. HABOBANERO sped clear to the set the pace, held a short lead in the two path into the drive and weakened. ENVY bumped at the start,
dropped to the back of the pack nearing the turn, lost whip into the stretch and never threatened. BALLET ROYALTY bumped by rival at the start, chased off
the rail then angled in, steadied entering the turn, remained inside and faded.

Footnotes
MARIAH GIRL (ARG) raced four then three wide around the first turn, stalked the top pair in the two path then tipped out three wide on the backstretch, bid
outside three deep around the far turn, took over in upper stretch, urged right-handed then hand urged and drew clear late. MIDNIGHT JAMBOREE drifted
out a bit into the 1st turn, dueled for the lead from inside then inched ahead of rival on the backstretch, put away inside foe then met the challenge from
outside, lost command in upper stretch and stayed on well to prove second best. HEART RIVER off a bit slow and got shuffled back at the start, tucked
inside on the first turn, raced two wide into the second bend, went between foes at the five-sixteenths pole, tipped out in the lane and gained the show.
TRUE MISCHIEF raced three wide then angled in on the first turn, saved ground to the stretch, angled out and got outkicked for the show honors.
SAMANDAH raced five then four wide on clubhouse turn, stayed off the inside, went four wide around the far turn and was never a factor. LADY O'PRADO
floated out into the first turn, dueled then pressed from outside, lost contact midway through the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
C FALLS established the front quickly from inside, turned away foe around the far turn, inched away into the stretch and held well through the final furlong.
I'M LEAVING YOU stalked along the inside, urged upon around the second turn, tipped outside the leader in the lane but could not summon the needed late
kick. ANTITHETICAL bumped leaving the gate, chased between rivals on the first turn, two wide up the backstretch, saved ground along the fence into the
stretch and held the show. HOOP DREAM stumbled and bumped with inside rival in the beginning, traveled four then three wide around the clubhouse turn,
sat off the pace outside a rival up the backstretch, angled out into the lane and improved position. GALLANT WARREN broke out and bumped rival, tucked
inside on the first turn trailing the field, stayed along the rail on the far turn and produced a mild rally. DREAMER'S REALITY bumped at the start, raced up
close outside the leader, put in a mild bid at the five-sixteenths pole but could not go on with the leader leaving the turn and faded. TALKING went three
deep through the first turn, traveled in range outside a rival or two wide, angled out in upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
OSCAR NOD set the pace under pressure, cleared rival leaving the turn, put to left-hand urging in the drive, led clear to deep stretch and held on at the
wire. WINTER STAR tracked outside a rival, went four then three wide around the turn, rallied from outside but was too late. VAROMA broke out, pressed
from inside, could not keep pace with the leader exiting the turn but finished willingly through the final furlong. MALIBU JEWEL chased from inside to the
lane but never produced a bid. COLD BREW KELLY advanced four wide around the turn and improved position. YOU'RE ALL TALK chased two wide then
outside a rival through the turn and could not rally. MISERICORS raced off the pace, entered turn five wide then moved down into the four path and
weakened in the drive. HAYNESPUN tracked off the inside, three wide into the lane and came up empty. FELICIDAD LEGADA stumbled badly at the start,
saved ground around the turn and never made an impact.

Footnotes
ST HELENA bumped leaving the gate, stalked the leader in the two path, tipped out in upper stretch, took over with a sixteenth to go and lasted over the
late charge from the runner-up. WARRENS CANDY GIRL bumped and checked between rivals entering the first turn, trailed into the backstretch, gained
ground through the far turn and angled six wide leaving the bend, closed widest through the drive and just missed. AGATA raced three to four wide around
the first turn, went three then two wide around the far turn, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied and got outkicked. FLAG SALUTE sped clear and angled
in on the first turn, set the pace in the two path up the backstretch, inched away nearing the drive, lost command approaching the sixteenth pole and yielded
in the closing moments. MENSA ON TAP off slow from the far outside, raced off the pace near the inside, saved ground to the lane, lacked room and
checked in upper stretch, gained a clear path and finished well between rivals late. MISS EVER READY bumped at the start then bumped again entering
the first turn, settled outside a rival on the backstretch, angled five wide leaving the far turn, responded to urging but need to find more late.

KNEEDEEPINSNOW went up inside to assume command, showed the way through the turn and into the stretch, show the whip through the lane and
remained clear to the wire. PARSIMONY stalked outside the leader, two wide around the turn, could not threaten the winner late but was clearly second
best. KING OF SPEED kept in range three wide to the stretch and went evenly through the final furlong. CALIFORNIA STREET brushed the outside gate
and came away a bit slowly, took the turn four wide and never rallied.

Footnotes
QUATTROELLE (IRE) angled to the rail early, sat off the pace, remained inside around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, rallied and proved best late.
JAVANICA stalked the pace inside, moved out into the two path on the backstretch, angled in then back out around the far turn, steered out further in the
lane, rallied but got outclosed by the winner. CARPE FORTUNA up close outside the pacesetter, gained command while drifting out a bit into the stretch,
lost command at the eighth pole and flattened in the late stages. PIZZAZZ settled off the inside, went three wide into the lane and lacked a bid. MICHALSKA
set the pace to the far turn, challenged around the bend, lost the lead into the stretch and gave way. DERBY QUEST unhurried in the beginning while
moving to the inside, saved ground into the stretch, tipped out and could not rally. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) angled to the rail early, remained inside to the
stretch, angled out at the top of the lane and was never a factor. ROYAL BLEND chased three wide around the first turn then outside a rival, traveled three
then two wide on the final bend and weakened.

Footnotes
SATCHEL DE RITCHES set the the pace between rivals, cleared at the top of the lane and drew away under a right-handed urging and strong handling late.
CAUSE AND EFFECT stalked from outside, took the turn four wide and gained the place. ADMIRABLY pressed three deep into and around the turn and
lacked the needed late kick in the final furlong. OLD INDIAN TRICK pressed the leader from inside to the stretch and weakened. EUSTACE stalked two
then three wide into the stretch and also weakened. CARTE BLANCHE raced off the rail then angled into the two path, outside a rival then three to four wide
leaving the bend and failed to respond when asked. MY HEART AWAKENS broke cleanly but was a bit slow into stride, tracked the pace near the inside
then angled out on the turn and failed to threaten. MY SUNSHINE entered the turn four wide, angled to the rail around the bend and proved no menace.

Footnotes
SIR OLIVER steadied briefly from between rivals early, tracked off the rail then moved into the two path, angled out on the turn, came four wide into the
lane, surged clear upper stretch and drew away. ABSOLUTE UNIT stalked the pace up the backstretch, raced along the rail into the turn, angled out into the
lane, could not make an impact on the winner and held the place. COSMO traveled near the back of the field, raced two wide into the turn, came out into
and upper stretch and summoned a late rally. JOHAN ZOFFANI (IRE) unhurried in the beginning, raced along the inside then three wide into the lane,
angled out in upper stretch and finished willingly. HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR drifted out crossing over surfaces early, raced off the pace, entered the turn
two wide, angled out into the stretch and went evened out in the final furlong. WITCH'S VOW drifted out crossing over surfaces early, moved back to the
inside and raced along the rail into the turn, came a bit off the rail into the stretch, chased between foes at the eighth pole then went on to split foes late to
improved position. DISCO BALL closest in pursuit early, roused two to three wide around the turn and weakened. EXPLOSIVE dueled for the lead from
inside, inched ahead of rival nearing the turn, cleared foe around the bend, was overtaken in upper stretch and gave wayy. FLYING CHARLIE off slow to
begin, trailed the field early on, traveled along the inside then angled out in the stretch and was never a factor. SKY DINSKI steadied early, chased off the
rail, was floated out early then angled inside near the nine-sixteenths pole, saved ground into the lane and faded. MCWHERTER dueled for the lead from
outside, lost contact with that foes around the turn, chased two wide to the stretch and faded.
