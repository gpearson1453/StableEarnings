Footnotes
BLUE BOY WHO set a pressured early pace, went three wide into the turn, drifted in and held. HENRY ON THE RUN pressed the early pace, went four
wide into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. ME AND JACK was outrun early, circled seven wide, was gaining late and needed more.
THIRSTY JUNIOR raced in mid pack early, raced between rivals, angled in and finished belatedly. WAYLAY was allowed to settle early, went six wide into
the turn and flattened out. ATTILA'S LEGEND was unhurried early, went four wide into the turn and passed tired rivals. KICK IT was void of any speed,
raced between rivals and never fired. EL BONGO was void of speed and was no threat. SWEET BEAU ROLL chased the early pace from the inside and
tired. MARTHAS BOY was up close early and was finished early.
