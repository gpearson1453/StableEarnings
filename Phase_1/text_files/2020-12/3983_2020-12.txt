Footnotes
BLUEWATER CAT unhurried early from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the drive, responded, drifted
in bothering GRAND OMEGA, continued on to be along in time. After Stewards' Inquiry into the running of the race BLUEWATER CAT was disqualified for
interference in the stretch. KING ZIPPY dueled from the outside early, battled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the drive but could not match
strides. GO GET THAT pressed the early pace from the outside, dueled through the second turn, remained engaged for the drive but could not keep pace.
G CISIVE forced the early pace outside, responded entering the drive and rallied late. ALL BIZNESS could only improve position. HONOR MY SPEED was
no real factor. GRAND OMEGA dueled from the inside early, battled up the backstretch, remained engaged entering the drive, was bothered at the sixteenth
pole then faded late. HALOS PRAYER had a steady fade. OPPORTUNITY COST was no threat. OVERLYAPPEALING was always outrun.

Footnotes
INFINITE PURGATORY dueled from the outside early, battled through the turn, shook loose entering the drive and was well clear while in hand the final
furlong. SHE A HOT MESS stalked the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded when asked but could not reach the
winner. RACHIE RACH forced the early pace inside, inched closer entering the turn, responded but could only hold position. KNIGHT'S HONOR dueled
from the inside early, remained engaged through the turn but could not keep pace. ULTIMATE FORCE chased the early pace inside but came up empty in
the drive. SHACKS RIVER was no factor. MY WICKED WISH was no threat. SHANGHAI HETTY was never close. JERSEY HOTTIE was always outrun.

forward entering the drive, responded but was outfinished. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE chased the early pace from the outside, advanced through the turn,
