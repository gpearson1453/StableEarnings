Footnotes
LEXI EM bumped with a rival at the start but went straight to the lead, set the pace while inside to the two path, responded well when asked outside the
quarter-pole, extended the advantage under a strong hand ride in upper stretch, was given one tap of a left-handed whip at the furlong marker then
maintained a safe advantage under a strong hand ride to the wire. LIL' SISTER LOU was asked leaving the gate, tracked the pace under some restraint,
rounded the turn in the two path, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths pole, chased the winner while still on her inside lead in the stretch and was second
best. FILM STUDY broke in and bumped with a foe, moved out at the rear then advanced on the outside midway down the backstretch, chased in the four
path on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and weakened. FLAT SCAT raced just off the pace on the inside, saved ground on the turn, was asked
outside the quarter-pole, had the rider lose his whip passing the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and tired.

Footnotes
HAVE NO FEAR broke very alertly and went straight to the front, controlled the action while inside through the turn, responded well when set down into
upper stretch, came under a right-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths, swapped back to her inside lead at the furlong marker and held under strong
urging. ALL FACT was hustled from the start, tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch,
made an outside bid under a right-handed whip at the three-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong, switched to a left-handed whip
around the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for the place. LA FEMME ROYALE settled on the inside, moved up outside the half-mile pole, was
well spotted just off the pace on the inside, came under urging along the rail on the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick
while able to get the show. LITTLE SNIP settled on the outside, was asked three wide on the turn, floated five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. GLANCE settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to rally. ALTERED DREAM
broke a half-step slow, settled at the rear, went three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. (Rail at 8 Feet)

four wide on the far turn, gained under a drive into upper stretch, took the lead into the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. JUANANDORA went
around the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid near the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two to three path under urging on
the far turn, took the advantage into the stretch, lost the lead to the winner into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead at the sixteenth-pole and

Footnotes
GOIN' GOOD broke a step slow, settled off the pace, went three wide for most of the turn then shifted four wide, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed well
to make an outside bid into the final furlong, took the advantage into the final sixteenth and prevailed under good handling. NEW BOSS showed good
speed, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear into the stretch, led under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then
was overtaken while clear for the place. RISKY REWARD showed speed between horses then dropped back, moved out around the half-mile pole, chased
in the two path for most of the turn then shifted three wide, spun four wide into the stretch, pursued the runner-up under a drive between horses passing the
three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. SUITE MADAM BLUE broke a step slow, settled off the pace, was roused three
wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. FLASH TOWN settled off the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn and failed to
respond. LITTLE SAMURAI veered out at the start and was off a bit slow, dropped well behind, went three wide on the turn, moved out in the stretch and
showed little. DONT FLOAT THE ICE contested the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faded. (Rail

Footnotes
CAYMANS COBRA tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three to four path on the turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, shook clear into
upper stretch, drew off under a drive into the final furlong and proved much the best under steady handling. ICE CRUSH moved out while just off the pace,
advanced closer near the half-mile pole, made a bid between horses in the two to three path on the far turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch
and proved no match for the winner while able to get the place. ARCHRIVAL settled off the pace, was urged along while four wide on the turn then driven
five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. SPARKYS SURPRISE was bumped at the start and forced out, settled
off the pace, was roused while four then three wide on the turn, drifted out under a left-handed whip between the three-sixteenths and the furlong marker
then failed to rally. MAGI broke out then was snatched up with the left-rein, moved clear early, was challenged near the half-mile pole, vied inside of two
foes while inside to the two path on the turn, lost the lead outside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and tired. DISTINCT QUALITY broke in
at the start, settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. TALKOTHTOWN was urged along at
the rear on the outside, went five wide on the turn and was no factor.

WHY JOEY WHY moved up to dispute the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path while still inside that foe on the turn, was asked at the
quarter-pole, came under the whip while battling with RECKLESS RANSOM in upper stretch, shook off that foe inside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed
under strong urging. ZENUCCI settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the turn, moved out from behind horses inside the three-sixteenths, gained
into the final sixteenth and finished with good courage to just garner the place. RECKLESS RANSOM showed speed on the outside, contested the pace on
the outside of a rival, vied in the three path on the turn, was put to a drive into the stretch, battled with the winner until near the sixteenth-pole then was
outfinished and lost the place near the wire. TAKEN BACK bumped with a rival after the start, settled on the outside, was asked while three wide on the turn,
drifted in coming to the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. IMPRESSIVE STUDENT bumped with a foe after the start then was in tight, was
reserved at the rear under restraint, moved out leaving the backstretch, advanced closer without being asked while four then five wide on the turn, was
roused six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. INSPECTOR EDDIE broke out at the start, chased the leading duo on the outside then
four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty.
