Footnotes
A SMILE A DAY set the pace led throughout, widened late, driving. SKIPSHOT LILLY was unhurried early, rallied five wide in the stretch and was up for
place. IAMGOINGTOSHINE was never far back, rallied in the stretch, could not gain late on the winner and and just missed place. WACKER'S GIRL was
unhurried early and passed tiring rivals. LEJEUNE chased the winner and weakened in mid stretch. SCARLETT'S AWISH raced mid pack and was no
threat. ANGELINA was slammed at the start and was no threat. GETOUTOFTHEHAREM was no factor. FRONT CIRCLE pressed on the inside and tired.
LA LA ANGEL was no factor. MOMA GIRL contended for a half, then stopped in the stretch.
