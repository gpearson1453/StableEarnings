ZOE'S GOLDLADY pressed the early pace, raced between rivals, took a brief lead late and held. QUANDARY chased the early pace, went six wide into the
turn, was gaining late and needed more ground. HEAVENLY ARCH set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, dueled with the winner and
weakened late. FEISTY FOXEY tracked the early pace, went seven wide and was empty late. HAVEN'S JOY was allowed to settle early, went three wide
into the turn and never fired. JUSTANOTHERLOVE was unhurried early, angled out and offered no rally. NOW PLAYING stalked the early pace from the
inside and faded. HIGH ON LIFE was void of speed, went four wide into the turn and was no factor.

DOM JULIO was allowed to settle, made a middle move from between rivals, took a brief lead late and held. GEORGIAN ROAD tracked the early pace,
went six wide into the second turn, was gaining late and just missed. SHARK HUNTER stalked the early pace, saved ground, made a bid on the winner and
weakened late. SEBASTIAN CAPE was void of any early speed, circled seven wide through the second turn and flattened out. VEIW FROM THE BAY was
taken back early, raced five wide into the second turn and never fired. TIZ A SLAYER was reserved off the pace, raced between rivals and gave way. NACI
STRADAMUS pressed the early pace from between rivals and was finished early. CARRY ON DIXIE set a pressured early pace from the inside and faded.
