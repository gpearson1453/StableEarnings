Footnotes
WEST LEONARD trailed for a half, closed willingly four wide into the stretch, drew on even terms for the lead before the furlong marker and prove best
under right handed urging. TICO THUNDER pressed the pace two wide for a half, made the lead, quickly shook clear, dug in when joined by the winner
near mid stretch and just missed hanging on. SEND ME ON raced outside and finished with good courage in the six path. GOLDEN AFLEET with the
second flight three wide, loomed boldly two wide near the quarter pole then was outfinished. FIRSTHAND JUSTICE stalked the pace along the inside into
the stretch then faded. CANT BUY COOL with the second flight between horses, weakened in the stretch. CRAFTY CHIEF was through after a half.
GALACTIC made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace for a half then flattened out.

Footnotes
FUNNEL CAKE stalked the pace into the stretch, rallied determinedly four wide in the five path and was along in time. MONTAUK COVE chased the pace
into the stretch, drifted out to the six path and was steadily gaining ground late. BIG TRIP broke in full stride to set the pace with a daylight lead until deep
stretch then was outfinished. CALORIC went evenly. JAMAICAN MAGIC delayed the start while refusing to load, settled close up and lacked the needed
response. LET'SCALLITEVEN passed tiring rivals. GUCCISSIMO was no factor. COINCIDENTALLY was no threat. BAD LITTLE BEAST was outrun.

CHARLEE'S MAGIC prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, responded in a perfectly timed ride to make the lead late and drew off under strong
handling. CLASSIC MO away alertly, set the pace until mid stretch then was no match for the winner. CRAZYCANTBERIGHTED stalked the pace in an
even effort. LUNAR HEAT chased the pace from the inside and faded in the stretch. ROLLIN WAY OVER close up near the inside, lacked the needed
response. KOLE MAN CAN was no threat. FURTHERINSTRUCTION was outrun. CELTIC LINE was no factor. TIZ A RUSH had speed into the turn then
stopped.

Footnotes
OHIO MUNNY broke in front, battled for the lead two wide into the stretch, shook clear and just lasted under right handed urging. BLISTERING PAKSHI
unhurried early, closed fast in the five path through the stretch but was too late. QUALITY MAN dueled with the winner two wide into the stretch then was
outfinished. BODYGUARD inside, went evenly. SPLIT MY BRITCHES hopped at the start, swung wide then passed tiring rivals. TAPAWAY with the second
flight, weakened in the stretch. IT'S A MANS WORLD prompted the pace three wide and was through after a half. TANCAHUA broke slowly and was outrun.
KONTAR was no threat. COREY'S CATCH was no factor.
