BODES SUNSET , three deep on the turn, chased the pace and weakened the final furlong. LOOKIN FOR CANDY broke sluggishly, was four deep leaving
the turn and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
WICKED PRANKSTER drafted back off the pace while saving ground early on, angled out near the turn and commenced a run, advanced three wide and to
the inside of a rival near the quarter pole, shifted out to about the five path, leveled off under right handed encouragement, forged to command late and was
going away at the line. STRETCH THE TRUTH broke on top and set a rated pace two wide, responded when asked and turned away foes into the lane,
shook clear under a strong drive, kept on gamely but failed to contain the winner. HEMP edged up past the five eighths and stalked three wide, bid outside
the leader while under asking near the quarter pole, gave hard chase leaving the furlong grounds and kept trying to the line. DR. FERBER moved up four
wide nearing the half mile marker, gave hard chase past the five sixteenths, continued wide into the lane but came up empty. SWING YOUR SWORD
tracked inside under some rating, lodged a mild bid inside rivals nearing the lane, failed to sustain past the three sixteenths and weakened. LEAVE 'EM
LOADED , urged off the pace while saving ground into the turn, failed to respond. ORIENTATED lagged outside a rival and never got involved.

Footnotes
CLOSER LOOK , unruly while reluctant to load, pulled his way clear into the first turn, dictated the pace, raced two wide while being challenged into the
lane, shook back clear under a drive leaving mid stretch and held firm to the wire. GENTLEMAN JOE stalked off the rail, was under pressure past the three
eighths, moved up outside the winner to threaten into the lane, failed to match strides past the furlong grounds but continued with interest. SASSY KING
lagged well back, was under coaxing around the final turn, circled four wide into the stretch and closed the gap. CROUCHELLI , off the pace while saving
ground, cut the corner into the lane but lacked a solid finish. WORKING TITLE , off a step slow after bobbling, regrouped and moved up four wide into the
first turn, remained wide while within range past the half mile marker, was put to strong asking leaving the far turn, failed to kick on and faded. SUPER
DANCER broke slowly, moved up behind foes into the first turn, came under a ride around the final turn, pursued three wide into the stretch, lost his rider
when suffering a catastrophic injury in mid stretch then was euthanized on the track. There was a stewards' inquiry but no action was taken.

Footnotes
GLENGAR rushed to the early, hugged the inner rail, dueled through the stretch and determinedly prevailed. WOLFINBARGER , two wide chasing the pace
on the turn, challenged for the lead approaching the stretch, dueled outside the winner and just missed in a game effort. TICKER TAPE PARADE , steadied
in traffic leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path between horses on the turn and failed to rally. JACK STRAIGHT stalked the pace while saving
ground around the turn and gave way in the drive. SMOKIN HOT FACTOR , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, drifted to the four path entering
the stretch and weakened. THE ITALIAN , a brief factor down the backstretch, raced four to five wide on the turn and failed to menace. AMERICANO trailed.

Footnotes
MORE TWIRL was hustled up behind rivals then steadied when a bit keen near the half mile marker, recovered and pursued in the clear mid turn, moved up
three wide in upper stretch and engaged the leader, seized command inside the furlong grounds then edged away under a steady hand ride. DISTANT
THUNDER hopped and squeezed back at the break, recovered and rushed up to contention, stalked into the turn, bid outside the leader past the three
eighths, moved clear under asking past the quarter pole, drifted in towards the rail in upper stretch, dug in when confronted then gave way grudgingly in the
final fifty yards. MAKE US SMILE chased three to four wide, found his best past the eighth pole but failed to threaten the top pair. BALTIMORE BUD vied
outside a rival, took over leaving the four and a half furlong pole, was confronted early turn, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. ROYAL TRUMPET ,
bumped at the start, was urged inside and failed to menace. KUKULKAN vied inside, failed to keep pace leaving the three eighths and retreated. CHEAT
'EM CHARLIE broke inward and bumped a rival, found himself well back early and failed to recover.

Footnotes
NOVA BOY lacked speed, circled the turn four wide, floated to the six path at the head of the lane, closed steadily outside rivals and was up approaching
the finish. DRILL'S LI'L MAN sped to the early lead, saved ground around the turn, opened a clear advantage in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly.
LAWN BOY (GB) saved ground on the turn, angled to the three path turning for home and finished gamely between rivals. KINGSTON PIKE , three wide on
the turn, was fanned to the five path in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally in an even effort. BALLIVOR lacked speed, saved ground on the turn,
eased off the rail for the stretch run, worked between horses and passed tired ones. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD , well placed in the two path on the turn,
raced between horses in the stretch and weakened. FUTILE , hugged the inner rail around the turn and failed to rally in the stretch. RIP RAP RILEY
prompted the pace outside DRILL'S LI'L MAN around the turn and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
FILLE D'ESPRIT rated just off the leaders while saving some ground, eased out and bid between foes after a half mile, secured command in upper stretch,
spurted clear under a drive past the three sixteenths, drifted in some then held firm while kept to task. TRUNK OF MONEY stalked three wide, bid four wide
outside rivals near the quarter pole, failed to match strides with the winner leaving the three sixteenths but held gamely to the wire. KISS THE GIRL ,
between foes early, tracked two wide nearing the lane and offered a mild rally. FIFTEEN ROYALS , off last after being bumped and squeezed, was taken to
rate off the pace, saved ground advancing into the lane, shifted out near mid stretch and closed steadily. PURRAGEOUS DYNA , bumped at the break,
rated back off heels soon after, raced well back around the turn, swung very wide into the lane and had a slight kick. DECOUPAGE drifted in at the break
and bumped with a rival, saved ground early, angled advancing past the five sixteenths, came about five wide for the drive but lacked a solid finish. MY
LOVELY GIRL sped clear early, dropped in towards the rail to set the pace, was joined by the top pair nearing the quarter pole, stayed on past the three
sixteenths then weakened. CONJECTURE , three to four wide, chased to the head of the lane then faded. LAWN DART , well wide throughout, faltered.

Footnotes
ITGOT GRANDMA , three wide the first turn, sprinted clear entering the backstretch, set all the pace and was kept to his business in the stretch. WHIRLIN
CURLIN stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide and offered a mild rally. IT'S FATE , slight off the rail most of the race, chased
the winner and faded. MOONLIGHT SHADOW lacked speed, was five deep turning for home and had a slight rally outside foes. RUMSON RALLY failed to
be a threat and passed tired horses. GOTHAM NEWS lacked speed, raced in the two path on the far turn and his rider dropped his whip entering the
stretch. LINDA'S NEKIA , three wide the first turn, was not a factor. VOODOO VALLEY hugged the inner rail around the far turn and was not a factor.
UHWARRIE SKY raced along the inner rail on both turns and gave way through the stretch.
