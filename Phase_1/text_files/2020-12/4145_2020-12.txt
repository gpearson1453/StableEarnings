out start, rushed to the turn, used up, dropped back. MOON DOG SPOT vied on the lead to the half but outkicked in the stretch. FINAL DELIVERY never a
threat. IRON MIKE was very unruly in the gate, rushed to the turn and gave way readily. SKY MIKE squeezed at the start and carried out past the quarter

outset, never a factor. MR. JIMENEZ dueled to the turn, stayed to deep stretch but stopped through the final stages. EL CASADORA close up inside to the
turn, struggled in the stretch run while stopping. THE DUTCH ANGLE reared start and never a factor. FINAL GAME never a threat. HEAD ON VIDEO NOT
