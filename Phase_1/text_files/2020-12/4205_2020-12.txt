ralliy along late for the place spot. AMANI'S KITTEN good position throughout raced well off rail in the stretch for show. JIMMY JOE well placed in good
position, stayed well in the stretch but faltered in the final furlong. ELECTRIC AVENUE no speed to turn, floated out widest to improve position late. UNCLE
GREGORY inside trip throughout, outkicked in the final furlong. TWINKLING KNIGHT never factored. COME ON VENEZUELA bore out bothered rival start,
rushed to contend, faded late. KICKAPOO bounced around start, never a mence thereafter. RAF brief duel to turn, gave way readily. KOLTEN'S COURT
was through early and retreated. HEAD ON VIDEO NOT PROVIDED TO EQUIBASE.
