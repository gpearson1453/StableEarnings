Footnotes
LUISANA PRINCESS sat behind a five-way dispute for the early lead, ranged up four wide to take over at the top of the stretch, and drew off under
pressure. QUID PRO GLOW was sent hard from the gate to contest the pace inside four opponents, got headed near the five-sixteenths, battled back on
the rail and proved clearly second best. PRETZEL contested the pace outside, steadied unable to hold her position just outside the quarter-pole, moved out
a couple paths and ran on well enough to salvage third. KERIK argued the pace between horses, could not keep up with the leaders on the turn, and faded.
V K PRINCESS saved ground outsprinted to the turn, and had no rally. MAIKO was widest of a quintet contesting the early pace, reached the front outside
QUID PRO GLOW after three furlongs, but faltered once straightened away for the drive. CORINTHIA vied early between horses, got shuffled back midway
on the turn and faded away.

Footnotes
SMOKE ALARM caught a flier at the start, immediately cleared and angled in to set the pace along the rail, shook clear early on the turn and widened under
moderate stretch urging. GRAND UNION was pushed inward into WORDMAN near the half-mile pole, steadied into the turn, angled three wide soon after,
rallied between foes in the lane and gained the place in the final strides. DISCREET TUNE bumped with WHO IS JARETT at the start, pressed the winner
two wide early, chased around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and lost second late. ROMARIO lacked early speed, raced four wide around
the turn and rallied belatedly. VICMAR chased the pace three wide and weakened in the drive. WHO IS JARETT was bumped at the start, raced two wide
and went evenly. PAPA LUKE came in and bumped GRAND UNION near the half-mile pole, chased the pace three and four wide and lacked a closing bid.
WORDMAN was bumped into the rail nearing the half-mile pole, saved ground and never threatened. FLORIDA LION broke in a tangle and was never
involved. SALTO DEL SABIO (CHI) was outrun inside. JUPITER BLUES played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
CANDY CRUSHEM tracked the early leaders from close range, took over readily from outside approaching the quarter-pole, and drew off hand urged
through the lane. DARDANELLOS was outrun for six furlongs, swung five wide into the stretch and was along late for the place. BUSINESS CYCLE vied
inside TRAPPEZOID up the backstretch, was no match for CANDY CRUSHEM leaving the turn, and gave way. LONG GRAY LINE was under a drive by
midway on the turn, and had no response. TRAPPEZOID contested the pace outside BUSINESS CYCLE to the turn, and gave way before completing six
furlongs. GRAY BEAU raced wide and made no impact.

MISS TAPIRADO prompted the pace two wide, steadily gained outside of the pacesetter through the lane and was up late under confident handling.
KATAMA MOONLIGHT set a rated pace along the rail, dug in inside of the winner and gave way grudgingly in deep stretch. DINN RIGH stalked the top two
finishers from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch and could only gain slightly. RECIPROCAL raced two wide around the turns went evenly. ZACCAPA (FR)
saved ground and failed to menace. MO CLARE'S was bumped a few strides after the start, raced two and three wide and never threatened. LAUGHABLE
chased the pace three wide and faded in the lane. ROCKIN WITH LUCKY was bumped early and trailed two wide.

Footnotes
SIR OLLIE settled well off the early pace, came five wide off the turn beginning to pick it up, finished determinedly outside and was up in the closing strides.
JOSHY JAK advanced rapidly four then three wide on the turn, wrested command outside FRENCH AFFAIR after a half-mile, shifted in to the rail moving
clear past the furlong marker, stayed on his left lead and could not hold off the top one. PROUD CONTENDER pressed the early pace between horses,
stayed on his left lead through the stretch and weakened. FRENCH AFFAIR hustled to the front after the start, set the pace inside, got overhauled coming to
the quarter-pole, and faded in the stretch. PICKING UP PENNIES advanced inside after a slow getaway, waited behind horses entering the turn, moved out
four wide approaching the stretch, and had no further response. NACHO SUPREME broke slowly, moved inside entering the turn, and remained outrun.
FORTY FLASH showed early speed three wide, retreated around the turn, and jogged in far behind.

Footnotes
UNICORN SALLY rated well back early, raced two wide around the first turn, saved ground rounding the far turn, briefly angled out near the quarter pole,
angled back to the rail in upper stretch, closed inside and was up late. MORNING COLORS stalked the pace in the three path, bid midway around the far
turn, battled on outside of MISS WROTE through the lane, finally got by near the sixteenth pole and led until the final strides. MISS WROTE set the pace in
the two path, dug in inside of MORNING COLORS when that foe bid nearing the lane, continued on the left lead through the stretch and fought on between
rivals while outfinished late. TWILIGHT saved ground in range, angled four wide near the eighth pole and had a mild rally. I'LL DO IT MY WAY saved
ground in midpack, angled out near the quarter pole and slowly gained widest. STRIKE MAGIC tracked the pace two wide, bid in the four path nearing the
lane but flattened out in the stretch. CHEROKEE SOUND was outrun while racing two and three wide. MAJIC FLASH played no factor while racing three
wide.

Footnotes
NEW YORK GIRL (IRE) saved ground in striking range for six furlongs, switched out three wide at the top of the stretch, caught OSAKA GIRL from outside
past the furlong marker and drew clear under vigorous hand urging. OSAKA GIRL prompted the pace outside AMADORA, wrested command after six
furlongs, went clear briefly in upper stretch, could not withstand the winner and was able to save the place. TAKE TEN was bumped between horses at the
start, advanced while being forced to go five wide approaching the stretch, and finished willingly outside. CRYSTALLE hit the left side of the gate and came
out two lengths slow, trailed inside for six furlongs, angled wide at the top of the stretch and offered a mild response to get up for the last major share.
COCONUT GROVE went along in the second flight to the far turn, moved out four wide floating TAKE TEN out past the quarter-pole, and flattened out into
the lane. PASSIVE INVESTING bumped with TAKE TEN at the start, and was never prominent. BEAM OF LIGHT raced two wide early, saved ground
around the far turn, and lacked the needed response. AMADORA bumped with TAKE TEN at the start, set the pace inside for six furlongs, and tired. EXTRA
EFFORT raced three wide, moved to contention after six furlongs, but was empty into the lane. GOOD LIFE CIDER was forwardly placed for a half-mile,
and dropped back steadily through run around the far turn.

MEXICAN WONDER BOY set a rated pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. VIOLENT CITY stalked the winner in the three path, lightly bumped
with EVERFAST in upper stretch, battled outside of that foe for the place through the lane and prevailed in that duel while unable to make an impression on
the winner. EVERFAST was in range in the two path, lightly bumped in upper stretch, vied inside for second through the lane and was outfinished. GARTER
AND TIE saved ground off the pace and lacked the needed rally. FAMISHED failed to menace while racing two wide. YOUCANTCATCHCURLIN chased
the pace three and four wide and was one-paced in the lane. SOLDADO had some early speed three wide, dropped back nearing the turn, raced three wide
around the bend and never threatened.

Footnotes
LAVI pressed the pace between horses, took over from TALKTHETALK after six furlongs, drove well clear through upper stretch and widened unthreatened.
CAT'S J N J was outrun early, swung five wide approaching the stretch, and rallied outside to be along for the place. DONT GET SMART was never far
back, moved off the rail approaching the stretch, and lacked the needed bid. VUYELWA followed behind the leaders two then three wide around the far turn,
had aim at the top of the stretch but weakened. MIDNIGHT GEM was outrun early, came four wide into the lane, and posed no threat. TALKTHETALK vied
inside for six furlongs, and gave way. KARENINA vied for command early, stayed close around the far turn three then four wide, and had nothing left in the
stretch. SOOTHING was finished early three wide. QUEEN FIELD retired early.
