Footnotes
MARKET DEVELOPMENT settled off the pace outside, raced three wide around the turn, reached even terms in midstretch, drew clear leaving the
sixteenth pole then switched back to the left lead and lugged in late. TODAYSTHEDAY chased the pace two wide, came four wide into the lane and rallied
for the place. TWIRLING FIRE dueled along the rail past the eighth pole, weakened and held for the show. BIG RED STYLE dueled two wide to midstretch
and tired late. DEPUTY INDY lacked speed, raced two wide around the turn, made progress through upper stretch, swung out late and flattened out. BLACK
V. K. slammed the starting gate, raced two wide in midpack, swung widest in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. COMPILER (IRE) failed to menace
while racing three wide. ARTISTA chased the pace from the rail, steadied near the quarter pole and retreated. TIN ROOF RUSTY had her head turned at
the start, saved ground and made little impact. EVEN MORE ROYAL was reluctant to load, raced three wide and never threatened. MARKET ECONOMY
was rank at the start and trailed inside.

Footnotes
TOOK A CAB dueled inside PRINCE IGOR, edged away as the rider dropped the whip approaching the top of the stretch, and widened through the furlong
grounds under a hand drive. ENANO ASTRAY bumped with SALTO DEL SABIO early, was in a bit tight heading to the turn in the two-path, moved out four
wide advancing near the quarter-pole, got bumped in mid stretch by PRINCE IGOR, and cleared for the place. MAKINALEGACY was outrun early, swung
four wide into the lane and was along for the show. PRINCE IGOR dueled outside TOOK A CAB, got shaken off into the stretch while beginning to drift out,
bumped into ENANO ASTRAY a furlong out and continued to weaken. EXPRESS BOY raced four to five wide around the turn, and went by tired horses.
RICH'S RAGS tracked three wide for a half-mile, and tired. COMISKEY PARK faded three wide before reaching the stretch. GRAN PATRON broke a couple
lengths behind the others, raced three to four wide and never factored. EL GRAN PICHON showed early speed inside, and tired. DEBBIE'S ROAD stayed in
range early between horses, and faltered after a half. SALTO DEL SABIO (CHI) rushed up into tight quarters after breaking a step slow, bumped with
ENANO ASTRAY and hit the rail outside the five-eighths, and dropped far back leaving the turn. AN OBJECTION BY THE TRAINER OF PRINCE IGOR
AGAINST ENANO ASTRAY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS DISMISSED.

Footnotes
JOSEFA was bumped at the start, sped right to the front, set the pace along the rail, angled out a bit in upper stretch and held clear under a drive.
TAILADIOS broke out and bumped the winner at the start, stalked the pace from the rail, could not gain on the winner in the lane while finishing willingly
inside for the place. GALILEOS BALLERINA tracked the pace two wide around the first turn, edged closer three deep rounding the far turn and finished
evenly to maintain the show. ANTIGONE raced well off the pace two wide, went three wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly. CHEROKEE SOUND
was bumped soon after the start, saved ground throughout and lacked the needed rally. ZANDREA'S bumped with CHEROKEE SOUND soon after the
start, pressed the winner two wide and weakened in the lane. MISS OVER THERE failed to menace while racing three and four wide. CACTUS KITTEN hit
the starting and was away two lengths behind the field, trailed inside to upper stretch, swung out in upper stretch and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
TIO WIL contested the early pace outside ONE FAST and BON PRIX, took over midway on the turn and moved in a path, widened under a drive through
the stretch and was geared down the last 70 yards. STRONG ENDING was outrun early inside, came two wide beginning to pick it up after a half-mile, and
rallied past the rest while no threat to the winner. BON PRIX argued the pace between horses for most of the opening three furlongs, and weakened
approaching the stretch. DREAM D'ORO saved ground into the turn, shifted out four wide at the top of the stretch, and could not menace. UNCAPTURED
KING hit the right side of the gate at the start, was ridden along at the back on the turn, and had no response. ONE FAST grabbed the early lead inside, was
soon joined by BON PRIX and TIO WILL, and folded up into the stretch.

CAMELLIA GAL stalked the pace two wide, bid three deep midway around the far turn, seized command near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive.
TRULY saved ground in midpack early, advanced two wide between rivals rounding the far turn, moved into second in upper stretch, proved no match for
the winner and held for the place. PEARLESCENT saved ground well off the pace, steadied near the quarter pole, swung out turning for home and rallied
widest. SMIRKOTCH raced well back two wide, advanced five wide around the far turn to reach contention in upper stretch and was one-paced through the
lane. LOVE RANGER failed to menace while racing two wide. BABY GIRL was outrun while racing three and four wide. REMARKABLE SILVER tracked the
pace from the rail while racing just inside of the winner for the initial six furlongs, angled three wide nearing the lane, checked in upper stretch and was not
urged further. V K LEGACY raced two wide in midpack early, dropped back nearing the far turn, went four and five wide around the bend and never
threatened. TERRIBLE TARA chased the pace two wide for a half and faded three wide around the far turn. FINA pressed the pace two wide, briefly led
between rivals early on the far turn and retreated through the lane. REVVEDUPLIKEADEUCE set the pace along the rail and stopped around the far turn.

Footnotes
CUATE lagged well back for a half-mile four wide, kicked in through mid stretch on the far outside, and rolled past the leaders 50 yards out to win going
away. EXXTOP pressed the early pace outside SILVER DOLLAR CITY, rallied in tandem with LITTLE DUDE as they overtook the leader coming to the
quarter-pole, brushed with LITTLE DUDE battling shoulder to shoulder through the lane, and was overhauled late. LITTLE DUDE slipped through on the
fence to challenge for command late on the turn, dueled inside EXXTOP brushing with that one through the furlong grounds, and weakened late. CHUCKY
raced two to three wide gaining mildly after a half, but flattened out in the stretch. TRUE IDENTITY got clipped from behind by GLOBALTROUBLECOCO
midway on the turn, and dropped back steadily. SILVER DOLLAR CITY set the early pace in the two-path, was caught from both flanks approaching the
stretch, and gave way. PAINTED RAGS moved off the inside around the turn, and could not get close. NINJA raced four then three wide on the turn, and
was through after a half. GLOBALTROUBLECOCO ran up behind horses into the turn, clipped the heels of TRUE IDENTITY near the three-eighths and lost
the rider, was apprehended and escorted off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE TURN BEFORE THE RESULT WAS
MADE OFFICIAL.

LIGHT FURY stalked the pace two wide, seized command near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. SHINING THROUGH saved ground in midpack,
was shuffled back around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and finished well. KRAMDEN set the pace along the rail, was collared near the quarter
pole and stayed on well to hold third. SHARETHEBLAME saved ground off the pace, swung out turning for home and improved position. POWER (BRZ)
saved ground in range and weakened around the far turn. CARK chased the pace two wide for a half, angled four wide early on the far turn and lacked a
rally. CAN'T HAVE ENOUGH was outrun while racing two and three wide early, came four wide off the far turn and bumped with BARBIE'S KING at the top
of the stretch. SMALL REASON hopped at the start, advanced four wide around the first turn, chased for a half then faded two wide around the far turn.
BARBIE'S KING raced three wide throughout, and bumped with CAN'T HAVE ENOUGH at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S PRIDE hustled to the front soon after the start, rated along clear and slightly off the rail around the turn, and widened through the stretch under
steady pressure. TIGER raced three wide, was under a full drive outside the quarter-pole getting closest to WARRIOR'S PRIDE, could not keep pace with
the leader into the lane, and ran on with good courage to hold second. FAMOUS GENT trailed inside after breaking a step slow, moved out in upper stretch
and rallied mildly for the show. CARSON CITY KID pursued the winner two wide, and faded gradually leaving the turn. THE ICE BEAST broke in the air, and
failed to menace through an inside trip. PALADIO raced three wide around the turn, and tired outside through the stretch.

SILENCED set a clear pace along the inside and widened under a drive. AMERICAN PHENOM broke out and bumped MYAMANOI at the start, stalked the
winner two wide in the clear, could not gain on that foe and lasted for the place. JOLTING JOE saved ground well back, angled out in upper stretch,
appeared reluctant to go through a somewhat narrow hole in upper stretch, angled in nearing the eighth pole and rallied inside. THRESHOLD saved ground
off the pace, went three wide around the far turn, came widest into the lane and lacked the needed rally. RHYTHMIA raced two wide in midpack for a half,
was ridden along three wide around the far turn and lacked a closing bid. FLOWMOTION saved ground to no avail. MYAMANOI was bumped at the start,
chased the pace three wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
SOUPER JAGUAR saved ground with the leaders in view up the backstretch, moved out three wide responding readily into the far turn, wrested command
outside POSITIVE PHIL coming to the eighth-pole and moved clear under a drive. SMALL HOPE was outrun into the far turn moving out three then four
wide, shifted back in rallying between horses a sixteenth out and was just up for the place inside SPINNING KITTEN. The latter saved ground advancing
after six furlongs, tipped out three wide in upper stretch, rallied into second past the eighth-pole, then was overhauled for that spot at the wire. TIME FOR
TROUBLE bumped with BACANO and was crowded between that one and SPINNING KITTEN at the start, was outrun to the stretch, moved out and found
his best stride belatedly. BACANO bumped with TIME FOR TROUBLE at the start, cut the corner putting in a run turning for home, then flattened out past
the furlong marker. POSITIVE PHIL vied inside LETS PLAY HARDBALL early, got collared by the winner in upper stretch, and gave way. CAPTAIN D raced
two to three wide in range for six furlongs, and lacked a closing bid. MASON'S SONG was never prominent. TONS OF GOLD was no factor inside. LETS
PLAY HARDBALL broke slowly, moved up swiftly first time through the stretch, vied outside POSITIVE PHIL to the far turn, and folded up. MANOFFIRE
raced three wide and was through after six furlongs. BUDGET BUSTER steadied between POSITIVE PHIL and LETS PLAY HARDBALL heading to the first
turn, got out badly through the far turn dropping far back, was pulled up and walked off.
