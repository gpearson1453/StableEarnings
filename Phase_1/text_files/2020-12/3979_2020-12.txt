Footnotes
AHNAF was forced in at the start, showed rail speed while well rated, pressured to far turn and stayed game to edge clear in the final stages. PAINTSVILLE
raced outside throughout, with a bold effort into stretch with the winner but was held at bay while no match and best of the rest. STONECASTLE broke in
start bothering foes, raced evenly throughout, with no kick in the final furlong. TREATIES good position inside but no late kick when needed in the stretch.
COMBATING lagged back to backestretch, boxed into the far turn but nothing left and came up empty. REAL MAN bothered start, regrouped to stay with
winner to quarter pole and stopped readily. HEAD ON VIDEO NOT PROVIDED.

run. HIGLEY O'PRADO never a menace. ENHANCED EDITION never menaced. STAND AND DELIVER never close. DARBY DART five wide first turn,

the far turn, improved position late. YABA DABA DIVA race evenly with no late response when needed. PROFILED back to the stretch, made up a bit of
ground in the drive. ASPROPODIA never a menace. DEFENDER OF FAITH never untracked thoughout. EVIE well placed for three quarters, gave way
