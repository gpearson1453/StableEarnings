Footnotes
AIN'T NONE LUCKY in the five path dueling on the backstretch, moved closer to the rail on the far turn, shook loose leaving turn, held a long lead with a
furlong to run and won with speed to spare. YOURINDENIAL, between foes early, was left with rail, moved outside again on the turn and rallied, drawing
away from the others. WANNA BE REGAL broke slowly, saved ground, eased out three wide on the far turn and tired. LEFTATTHEALTAR broke slowly and
a bit awkwardly, raced between foes early, went inside on the turn and gave way. CONNOISSEUR racing outside winner, was finished leaving the turn.
MISS JASSER raced wide and showed little. ALMOST EVIL, three wide, failed to be a serious threat. PATTY'S TEMPLE saved ground, steadied in tight on
the far turn then dropped back. BELLA LUCIA, very wide, showed nothing. SHOT AT STARDOM had only brief speed.

TRUST FUND GIRL broke out bumping a rival at the start, raced three wide off the pace, bid three wide on the far turn, drew clear in upper stretch and held
well under urging. SONG OF HONOR raced off the pace inside, then two wide, went four wide past the quarter pole, rallied outside in the stretch run and
finished well. SPRITE'S LADY stalked the pace racing outside rivals, moved up inside on the far turn, angled out at the quarter pole and rallied mildly.
SPECIAL LOVE tracked inside and lacked a bid. BONNIES DREAM was bumped at the start, stalked between rivals, made a rail bid at the half mile marker,
dueled and weakened. BARN QUEEN raced three wide off the pace and did not factor. LA MAMA CHULA set the pace racing off the inside with a clear
early lead, dueled into the far turn and faded. EXTRA CRISPY raced off the pace between rivals, then three wide and did not factor.

STRONG BREEZE took the lead three wide racing into the first turn, dueled three then two wide, edged away in early stretch and widened to the wire.
SPRING EMPEROR was wide while outrun, drifted wider through stretch and was up for place. GAULTIER (FR) raced outside and failed to menace. FIST
OF THOR dueled for command between foes, was left with rail on the backstretch and tired. ASPHALT PAVING broke like a shot, dueled inside, was eased
back before a half, was moved to the outside and tired. ECLIPSED MOON showed nothing. FIVE MORE MINUTES raced in the four path chasing the
leaders and gave way. LOAN ME YOUR EAR was never a factor.

FINAL SHOT never had to leave the rail, engaged for the lead near mid stretch and slowly edged clear. THISCATCANJUMP between foes, was caught
behind a wall of horses racing under a snug hold, was angled out early stretch and gained place. DANCING BULL came out leaving the gate, dueled in four
path, allowed winner to rally inside, lost the lead leaving furlong grounds and weakened. BRILLIANT CHASE raced very wide and drifted wider through
stretch. SPLICETHEMAINBRACE challenged three wide on the backstretch and faded through the final furlong. LATE BREAKING NEWS didn't break
sharply, raced off the rail and didn't threaten. PATTY'S BOY broke slowly, was extremely wide into and through stretch.

Footnotes
ANGEL RAPHAEL was slowest from the gate but then was quickly sent up along the rail and joined for command, took the lead on the turn, edged clear
then held on. FOUR SEASONS GIRL, two wide early, swung very wide on the turn and through stretch and was gaining. RUNNING GIRL dueled for
command two wide and held on gamely. JULIET'S MUSIC came in and bumped LADY MISTRESS then bobbled leaving the gate, raced two wide and
finished willingly. STAY SALTY saved ground to mid stretch, was angled out and lacked a closing kick. OUR CLAIRE BEAR raced three wide and failed to
menace. TAYLOR'S BELLE saved ground to mid stretch, angled out deep stretch and came up empty. LADY MISTRESS, bumped leaving the gate, raced
between foes then tired. TOO MUCH DRAMA raced wide and showed little. DRIVER'S LICENSE raced wide and was no factor. LIGHT OF HOPE was wide
and just off the early pace then tired.
