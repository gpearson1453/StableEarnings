ALEX'S TURN dueled from the inside early, gained a clear margin up the backstretch, remained clear through the second turn, continued to show the way
at the eighth pole and held sway. FLASHING ANGELBABY chased the early pace from the inside, remained forward for the drive but could not keep pace
while gaining the place. THREE RUN HOMER chased the early pace inside, made a bid entering the drive and was up for the show. MUCH CLASS stalked
the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, made a bid but flattened out in the drive. GREELEY'S DEALER was no factor.
LUCKY INFERNO chased the early pace and tired. MR. GRACEFUL was never close.
