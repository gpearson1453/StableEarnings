Footnotes
TAYLER'S CHROME showed good early speed while racing in the two path down the backstretch, was asked nearing the eighth pole and drew off to be
well clear under strong handling. CLOSERTOTHEHEART was allowed to settle early on, raced along the inside around the far turn, angled four wide
through the drive and was no match for the winner. MOONSAFE pressed the leader from the inside to show good early speed and weakened the final
eighth of a mile. BABY MELISSA lunged at the break, raced towards the inside throughout and had no response. SALAMINA settled off the early pace,
raced four wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. DETERMINED HONOR stalked the pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch
and tired.

DAT DARES GOLD set all the pace along the inside, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure. I'M SO MUNNY pressed the pace while racing
between rivals and finished gamely to the wire. SPLENDOR GAL stalked the pace from the outside, raced four deep at the eighth pole and kept on to the
wire. CIAO LUNA was allowed to settle early, saved ground around the far turn into the stretch, angled five wide through the drive and had not enough late.
DRIVE IN was unhurried early, raced six wide at the eighth pole and had no late response. MY T TALK was slow early on, raced three deep in the stretch
and failed to respond. GOTTAFLATHAVEHER was forwardly placed early to stalk the pace and failed to sustain a bid.

LITTLE HUNTRESS was quick to begin to set all the pace, raced along the inside throughout, built a long lead through the stretch while never being asked
to be an easy winner. DOOR BUSTER stalked the pace, raced three wide nearing the eighth pole and was no match for the winner. SPEED LANE was slow
early, raced four deep at the three sixteenths pole and had no final bid in the drive. LONG DISTANCE LOVE settled off the early pace, raced five wide into
the upper stretch and never was a factor. FLAVA'S DREAM dropped back early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and failed to respond. BESTLA failed
to sustain a bid.

weakened the final eighth a mile. VICTORY GIVEN stalked the early pace, raced four deep through the stretch, raced in tight just past the sixteenth pole
and had no final bid. FIVE CARD DRAW stalked the pace, raced towards the inside throughout and had no response. SAVE ME PAULA dropped back
early, raced four wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. ROBBER BOB was unhurried early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never
threatened. SING A VERSE was bumped at the break, raced six wide at the eighth pole and had no response. SHUDDAWUDDACUDDA pressed the leader

ORIGINALY FROM DOT pressed the early pace, took command entering the far turn and built a long lead through the drive under steady handling. FANCY
PRINCESS was slow early on, moved up five wide at the three sixteenths pole and was no match for the winner. ROCKS THAT I GOT was unhurried early,
raced six wide nearing the eighth pole and made a mild late bid. HOT TO PARTY set all the pace from the inside and weakened in the drive. STEELY
BAND dropped back early, raced three wide in the stretch and never was a factor. TOP HAT BOSS stalked the pace, raced five deep at the three sixteenths
pole and had no response. GRACE N FAVOR raced six wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. EMPERADORA failed to respond. AWESOME
BUTTERFLY failed to sustain a bid.

GIMME'S GOLDENGIRL stalked the pace, raced five wide at the three sixteenths pole and finished well to get up under strong enouragement. MISS
MAJORETTE stalked the early pace, angled six wide through the stretch and closed in well late. SUNDOG was allowed to settle early on, moved up five
wide into the upper stretch and made a good late gain. GOLD FINCH showed good speed along the inside and weakened. RONA was off slowly, raced four
wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. GOLDEN LASSIE pressed the pace from the outside and tired. ASHARA went to his nose at the break, lost
a considerable amount of ground, raced four deep in the lane and never was a factor. LADY MAGNOLIA settled off the early pace, raced five wide in the
stretch and failed to respond.
