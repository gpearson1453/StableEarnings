Footnotes
MALRAUX set the pace along the inside, shook clear from a pressing rival in upper stretch, and held sway under driving pressure. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR
tracked from midpack along the inside while a path off of the rail, gained turning for home to split foes at the quarter pole as the leader kicked away, shifted
three wide in upper stretch and rallied to secure place. NO BANG NO BOOM (IRE) prompted the pace setter two wide, but failed to keep pace with that foe
turning for home, tired through the lane, but just held show. FRANCO'S TEAM lied far off of the pace three wide around the turn, swung five wide turning for
home, and rallied for a minor share. COOL HAND COOP tracked from midpack two wide early on, took the turn in the three path before shifting four wide
turning for home, and finished up evenly without threatening. CALAMITY KAT hopped a bit at the start, trailed the field in the three path into the turn, shifted
four wide in upper stretch where she split foes, and stayed on mildly thereafter. MOON PISTOL saved ground far off of the pace, split tiring foes in upper
stretch, and failed to factor. CONGRATS THAT chased under urging while just off the leaders early on, but faded turning for home. ANOTHER SOFTBALL
lied forwardly placed two wide and between horses, took the turn in the three path, but faltered in upper stretch. NO NAY MAYBE (IRE) failed to factor. SEA
TRIDENT tracked forwardly placed three wide, took the turn in the four path, but faltered after drifting to the five path turning for home. BAHAMIAN PRINCE
was eased early on by the rider, was distanced throughout, required outrider assistance in midstretch to be pulled up, then walked off.

Footnotes
GONE TO CABO absorbed a solid bump from SAMURAI FIGHTER at the start, tracked outside PRETZEL early, took over readily coming to the
five-sixteenths and steadily drew off under a mild drive. I'M A COCO PEBBLES bumped with BACKSTORY at the start, stayed close early inside the
leaders, shifted out three wide leaving the turn, and bested the others while no threat to the winner. SAMURAI FIGHTER stumbled at the start and
recovered inward bumping GONE TO CABO, moved inside around the turn, and rallied mildly to go clear of the remainder. TONALA was pushed in after the
start, saved ground outrun to the stretch, and passed tired horses. PRETZEL set the early pace inside, was powerless to fend off GONE TO CABO midway
on the turn, and gave way. HOLY SECRET broke slowly, and was no factor three then four wide. DANCE FOR THE SUN raced three wide and was through
after a half-mile. BACKSTORY broke in bumping I'M A COCO PEBBLES at the start, and was finished early.

FOSTER HOPE chased from the thee path into the turn, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, battled between horses turning for home as JOSHY JAK
ranged up along side, brushed his inner counterpart in upper stretch before drifting out through the final furlong on his left lead, but managed to fend off
JOSHY JAK to the wire. JOSHY JAK gained ground in the five path around the turn to bid for the lead outside of a pair of foes at the quarter pole, drifted out
through midstretch while trying to forge an advantage, but failed to do so through the late stages, and hung. SPEIGHT set the pace inside of a pressing foe
early on, met bids from FOSTER HOPE and then JOSHY JAK turning for home, was brushed by the prior in upper stretch, then yielded passing the furlong
pole. CONVERTER stalked along the inside, loomed in hand from just behind the leaders at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to produce a bid and chased
mildly through the lane. ZIGGY broke inwards and bumped a foe at the start, lied unhurried in the two path far off of the pace around the turn, then stayed
on mildly to improve through the lane. DROPPED ANCHOR shifted to the four path passing the three furlong pole while tracking from midpack, but came
under driving pressure after doing so, chased the leaders turning for home, then faded through the lane. NAVAJO CREED took the turn in the four path
while far off of the pace, and was outrun. TWELVE O ONE vied for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole, and stopped
thereafter. DOUBLE DAVID was outrun and showed little.

CAN'T BUY LOVE was allowed to settle early, swung four wide rallying into the stretch, and overhauled DANCING CRANE from outside in the last strides.
DANCING CRANE vied for command between MISSING LINK and FOOLISH HEART into the turn, spurted away through upper stretch, and was nailed
near the wire. HEART OF GOD was outsprinted to the head of the stretch in the two-path, and rallied mildly. PINK FIZZ was sent hard from the gate,
steadied inside the leaders unable to hold her position entering the turn, moved out three wide making a run into the stretch, was tardy changing leads and
weakened. SPECIAL INCLUSION angled four wide coming off the turn, and made no headway. FOOLISH HEART contested the early pace outside rivals,
got shaken off by DANCING CRANE soon after going three-eighths of a mile, and faded steadily. MISSING LINK led early under pressure from both flanks,
moved inside getting outpaced around the turn, lacked room and steadied on the rail giving way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
R ADIOS JERSEY brushed the gate but quickly established an advantage, drew clear in the two to three path around the turn, then widened through the
lane despite hanging on her left lead. QUEEN STREET broke inwards, saved ground from midpack, then improved along the rail through the lane without
menacing the leader, and just held place from YEGUITA QUEEN on the wire. YEGUITA QUEEN stumbled a few steps after the gates opened, lied far off of
the pace in the four path around the turn, split foes in upper stretch while commencing a rally, altered course outside of foes in midstretch, and sustained her
bid late, but just missed reaching place. ELLIEREESEASTON shied inwards from an outer foe and bumped an inner rival at the start, raced far off of the
pace in the three to four path around the turn, then stayed on through the lane, but was outfinished by foes for minor placings. FIOR DI LATTE took bumps
from rivals on both sides at the start, rushed to stalk the pace from the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, then weakened
between horses in the late stages. PLAYERA broke outwards and caused a rival to be pinched at the start, chased two wide early on, but weakened through
the lane. DISPENSE got pinched back at the start, saved ground far off of the pace, but never got involved. BEAUTY BOSS trailed the field in the six path
around the turn, and showed little. BRITISH EDGE was off a step slowly, tracked from midpack, inched forward on the leaders from the three path around
the turn, but drifted to the five path as the rider lacked effort turning for home, and was eased passing the quarter pole.

CHESS'S DREAM moved inside unhurried around the first turn and up the backstretch, began moving after a half-mile and angled out four wide
approaching the stretch, reached the front from outside coming to the eighth-pole and drove clear decisively. TRIPLE JEOPARDY saved ground through the
turns well out of it, moved out in the stretch and finished willingly. TORETTO had difficulty cornering while a bit unsettled into the first turn, put in a
three-wide bid midway on the far turn and into upper stretch, weakened late and salvaged the show. MAGICAL ADVENTURE was outrun early three wide,
moved in a path to the far turn, rallied mildly and just missed third. FRENCH AFFAIR broke alertly despite brushing the left side of the gate, set the pace
inside for a half-mile, yielded to challengers nearing the stretch and gave way. QUINTO SOL was no factor four wide most of the way. LOYAL LOUIE
prompted the pace outside FRENCH AFFAIR for a half, and tired. SOSOSUBTLE had an inside trip, and faded through the drive. BORKAN settled in the
middle of the field early, got out-moved as the winner cut in front of him past the quarter-pole four wide, and was empty from there. CHIPSHAPE raced three
wide and tired.

Footnotes
BABY BROTHER lied off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, rallied four wide through the lane, and sustained his grind to just get up at the
wire. DIAMONDS ENJOY broke inwards, dueled for the lead between horses early on, then only inside of CHILI HAZE into the turn, shook clear in upper
stretch, held a margin until late, but was nailed on the wire by an outer oncharging foe. VALIANT APPEAL stalked three wide, inched closer to bid for the
lead turning for home, but was outfinished by an outer foe in the late stages while also failing to catch the leader. ROAD TO PEACE was pinched back at
the start and trailed the field around the turn, then swung six wide turning for home, and rallied willingly for a minor share. EL ZEUS lied off of the pace two
to three wide, and failed to factor. IT'S A RISK vied for the lead inside of a pair of foes early on, but failed to keep pace with them after a quarter mile,
chased into the turn, but faded around it, then passed tired foes late. CHILL HAZE dueled for the lead three to two wide early on, vied between horses
turning for home, but weakened in upper stretch. BAHAMIAN BEAT bumped an outer foe at the start, advanced mildly four to five wide around the turn, but
weakened in upper stretch and failed to factor. CAPITAN FOFO was bumped between horses at the start, tracked forwardly placed two wide and between
horses into the turn, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole.

LENZI'S LUCKY LADY sprinted clear after the start, set a brisk pace in the two-path to the stretch, and responded to pressure to preserve the decision.
LAGERTHA (CHI) pursued outside LENZI'S LUCKY LADY from the outset, stayed on well and was edging closer at the finish. SPUN GLASS saved ground
just off the leaders to the stretch, and could not gain with an even finish. ROMAN D'ORO gained some ground on the turn three then four wide, but could not
sustain the bid. SWEET YARE N DIRA raced two wide to the lane, and ran on evenly between horses. MISS DEPLORABLE chased four then three wide to
the top of the stretch, and lacked a closing response. SOMETHING MAGICAL broke two to three lengths behind the field, and trailed inside.

Footnotes
FROSTED GRACE lied off of the pace along the inside after breaking outwards just a bid, tracked from behind the leaders and in range of the pace in the
two path around the turn, shifted four wide turning for home to split foes at the three sixteenths pole, then forged an advantage approaching the furlong
marker, and held while hanging on his left lead. WITH VERVE broke outwards carrying an outer foe with him, settled off of the pace three wide, faltered to
trail the field passing the half mile pole, then took the turn in the four to five path before shifting six wide turning for home, and rallied through the lane but
failed to reach the leader. CAJUN BROTHER stalked along the inside, surged through a rail opening to bid for the lead inside of multiple foes at the quarter
pole, forged a narrow advantage turning for home, but was headed approaching the furlong marker, then kept on. AS SEEN ON TV prompted the pace
setter while being kept in the three path by that foe, inched closer to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, shifted down a bit turning for home while
between horses as other foes ranged up along side, then weakened in upper stretch. TAKE COMMAND lied off of the pace two wide, advanced in the four
path around the turn to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but was floated five wide by the eventual winner at the three sixteenths pole, and faltered.
RUNNING FOR RIZ set the pace while staying a path off of the rail, met bids from rivals on both sides at the quarter pole, got headed by those foes and put
to tight quarters by them at the three sixteenths marker, then weakened thereafter.

Footnotes
MOROCCO was forced out a bit by SNIPER KITTEN and bumped lightly with STIRLING DRIVE after the start, saved ground unhurried off a torrid early
pace, took closer order waiting behind horses midway on the far turn, maneuvered out four wide coming clear into the stretch, closed steadily between
horses and was along in the last 70 yards. DUROCHER bumped with ARTREMUS BRIDGE at the start, trailed far back for a half-mile, got closer while
swinging four wide approaching the stretch, and finished well on the far outside. STIRLING DRIVE made some contact with MOROCCO after the start,
raced inside well back for a half-mile, came four wide off the far turn to loom a threat outside SNIPER KITTEN, but was outkicked. SNIPER KITTEN broke
outward, moved to contention rapidly two then three wide after six furlongs, took over outside MAX K. O. leaving the far turn, moved in going clear through
upper stretch, and was overrun through the final stages. ARTEMUS BRIDGE bumped with DUROCHER at the start, lagged far back early, moved out three
wide approaching the stretch, and passed tired horses. TROUBLING MOON raced two to three wide, and was never prominent. FOREVER MO broke slow
and was three wide early near the tail of the field, fanned five wide into the lane and made no progress. KING'S HONOR (IRE) eyed the breakaway leaders
up the backstretch, and began to give way inside before completing six furlongs. MAX K. O. was four paths off the rail being hounded from outside by SIR
SEAMUS entering the first turn, carved out a breakneck pace for six furlongs, and had nothing left. SIR SEAMUS pressed MAX K. O. through demanding
fractions for six furlongs, and was used up soon after that.

Footnotes
PHANTOM VISION stalked two wide, ranged up to the leader with five sixteenths to run, responded when called upon in upper stretch, and drew off.
REINAGOL stalked along the inside, glided out three wide turning for home to produce a bid, but failed to keep pace with an inner foe in upper stretch,
veered out passing the furlong pole into SPILL THE TEA's path, then just held place from that rival. SPILL THE TEA took bumps from rivals on both sides at
the start, rated off of the pace in the two path into the turn, shifted three wide turning for home, then five wide in upper stretch, commenced a rally, but shied
outwards a bit when REINAGOT veered across her path at the furlong pole, the sustained her charge, but just failed to reach that foe for place. CANDY JAR
bumped the gate at the start, lied far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, then stayed on in the four path through the lane. DIVINE
ENCOUNTER was off a step slowly, saved ground in midpack around the turn, tipped two wide in upper stretch, and stayed on. VIVA LA RED was off
slowly, saved ground at the rear of the pace around the turn, and produced a mild rally. THIRD TIME AROUND stalked from the two to three path, got
floated four wide turning for home, but was outkicked by inner foes in upper stretch, and faded. EMUNAH bumped an inner foe at the start, trailed two wide,
and failed to factor. KAY'S PROJECT bumped an outer foe at the start, tracked from midpack in the three to four path around the turn, and weakened in
upper stretch. CLASSIC SECRET cleared into the turn, met the winner's bid at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened in upper stretch. Following the race,
the rider of SPILL THE TEA claimed foul against the rider of REINAGOL for interference in midstretch, which was allowed by the stewards. REINAGOL was
disqualified and placed third.
