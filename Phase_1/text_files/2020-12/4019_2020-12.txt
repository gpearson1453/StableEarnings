Footnotes
BOURBONIC six paths off the inside down the backstretch, advanced and tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun three wide for home, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, drew clear under a drive to prevail. BLU GROTTO broke in at the start and
was corrected, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from MAGNIFICENT CHROME to his inside early on, shook off that
pressure and tucked inside half a mile from home, remained patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was
collared just inside the eighth pole, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. SONO GRATO chased two to three wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced into the show honors and swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened while well clear of
the rest. BELLAGIO broke in at the start bumping MAGNIFICENT CHROME, chased along the inside down the backstretch, tipped out to be three to four
wide midway on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. SPEECHIN N TEACHIN four paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch,
tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. MAGNIFICENT CHROME bumped
at the start by BELLAGIO, who broke inwards, prompted the leader from the inside in the three path down the backstretch until shaken off nearing the half
mile pole, tucked inside at that station, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. LEND AMERICA coaxed
from the gate, chased five then four wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, faltered and was eased through the
final furlong.

Footnotes
PENDOLINO pressed the issue from path two, bid into the lane, took charge during the ensuing furlong, felt the presence of the runner up in the final
stages, dug in to stay in the clear. CHOOSE HAPPINESS bumped at the start, pursued the pace two wide, altered course into the four path in midstretch,
closed in belatedly, fell short. QUEENDOM departed the backstretch from the three path, was in the same one heading home, failed to make any headway
during the stretch run. FOLEY SQUARE came out, bumping with and then carrying out FIRST DAWN, assumed a prominent position, was off the inside
contending for the top, cut over to the rail as the half was being rattled off, showed the way, tailed by the eventual winner from the outside, got put to the test
turning into the stretch, yielded, weakened in the final furlong. FIRST DAWN pushed out by an incoming FOLEY SQUARE, made some contact with
CHOOSE HAPPINESS afterwards as well, chased the pace from off the rail, went about the turn from path tour, commenced the stretch one path farther off
the rail, failed to fire. PRINCESS IN CHARGE forwardly placed along the inside route, faltered. MAD FOR FAME two wide on the turn, had no rally.
STRETCHTHESTORY rode the rail to no avail.

HARDCORE FOLKLORE six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got
brushed when REAL DAN attempted to make a seam for himself nearing the quarter pole and denied the move, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive angling out near the eighth pole as PLAYWRIGHT drifted in front, rallied to latch on that rival and was brushed at the sixteenth marker as that
rival came out under a near sided stick, had the rider get his whip momentarily stuck under the boot of PLAYWRIGHT'S jock before extracting it then used
the stick in the final jumps between foes in a trio of taps on his leaning rival and was just up on the wire. PLAYWRIGHT five wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, drifted out just inside that station and
was corrected, got confronted nearing the sixteenth marker, dug in drifting out under near sided stick to brush his main rival at that station, got tapped three
times nearing the wire by his main foe and was nailed in the very last stride. REAL DAN four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, attempted to tip out and create a seam between HARDCORE FOLKLORE and SCARF IT DOWN and was denied the move being forced to
steady before swinging six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. HERO'S HOPE chased four then three wide under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, continued three to four wide for home and weakened in the late stages. DEEP SEA chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile
from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. HOORAY FOR HARVEY spurted
away early on three wide, tucked to the two path into the turn, got set down continuing just off the inside for home, got collared nearing the eighth pole and
weakened. SCARF IT DOWN coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and
tired. HONORABLE HERO chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. There was a
Jockey's Objection by the rider of REAL DAN alleging interference against HARDCORE FOLKLORE at the quarter pole. After review, the objection was
dismissed and the result was allowed to stand before being declared official.

Footnotes
BERENICE off the inside, pursued the pace three wide on the turn, swung into the lane and took off in earnest after the ones to catch, grabbed the
advantage travelling her way through the furlong grounds, edged clear, then held well to fend off the late bid coming from SEASIDE RETREAT. SEASIDE
RETREAT took up the chase from path two, between rivals for a good portion of the opening three-quarters pole, commenced the stretch run slightly farther
off the rail, gained ground in a steadfast manner, split rivals in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole en route for the place. HALO CITY content to bring up the
back of the pack on the backstretch, departed the backstretch from path four, advanced towards the front runners, tipped into path five for the stretch, drive,
stayed on in the final furlong to earn the show. DOVIMA chased the pace three to four wide, fanned out into the six path from upper to midstretch, made no
headway late. DANCE FOR THE GOLD remained forwardly placed after an alert getaway, vied for the top from the two path, came under a ride heading
home, saw the winner claim the top during the ensuing furlong, backed away herself leaving the eighth pole. LUCKY GIRL in hand settling for a pocket trip
exiting the chute, tracked the front runners continuing to save ground for six furlongs, angled approximately four wide at the three-sixteenths pole, gave way.
AUNT KAT spotted two wide at the top of the turn, failed to menace. ALEMIA vied for the top from along the inside for three-quarters, folded.

command nearing the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to prevail. OPT six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place
honors. SIX PERCENT chased three then two wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages.
PATEGORY ONE three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took narrow and brief command at the
five-sixteenths before being displaced by the eventual winner nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going.
KLICKITAT chased three to four wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. BLUGRASCAT'S
SMILE four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for
home and tired. NOT THAT BRADY hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths under pressure, yielded the front with five-sixteenths remaining, cornered just off the inside for home, tired and was not
persevered with through the final furlong.

Footnotes
LAOBANONAPRAYER settled into a prominent position after the field had been sent off and running, kept watch three to four wide on the front runners
under a confident ride on the turn, crept up when ready nearing the quarter pole, had already grabbed away the advantage when called upon for more in the
general area of the three-sixteenths marker, drew off, kept to a light drive. JILL'S A HOT MESS vied for command from along the inside route, tipped
towards path two when challenged by the winner settling onto the top of the lane, proved no match while comfortably clear of the others for the place.
SHANES PRETTY LADY pursued the pace three wide on the turn, got sent out five wide upper to midstretch, finished well enough to get up for the show.
POP THE BUBBLY took up position in midpack after stumbling at the start, chased the pace three wide on the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wider,
lost out on third. PAZZION saved ground until the end of the bend, was gradually worked into the three path during the first half of the stretch run, made no
headway. MS WICKED two wide onto the turn, swung out three wide exiting it, had no offering. GRAY DESTINY broke about the two lengths the tardiest,
never made her presence felt off the ground-saving journey that followed. VIVE LA LIBERTY sighted three wide on the top of the turn, got spotted in path
four at the top of the lane, gave way. FLOWER'S FORTUNE the widest of three contending for the lead during the initial stages, went at it matched up with
JILL'S A HOT MESS afterwards from the two path, was called upon for more shortly after entering the turn, shifted to the rail in the vicinity of the
five-sixteenths pole, cut the corner and backed away. ATHENA DANCER three wide in pursuit of the front runners on the bend, wandered out towards path
seven heading onto the top of the lane on empty. U SHOULD B DANCING pulling while vying between foes early, dropped back, travelled two wide on the
turn, went five wide into the lane, backed away, then bore out in the last eighth.

Footnotes
HONOR WAY four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the
final furlong, took over command inside the final sixteenth and inched away to the finish to prevail. HONEY I'M GOOD coaxed from the gate, showed the
way in hand three then two wide, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive coming under threat inside the final eighth and was
collared inside the sixteenth marker, ran on to preserve the place honors. PACIFIC GALE bumped at the break by BRIDLEWOOD CAT who broke
outwards, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, spun three wide for home, dug in keeping on to
the finish to secure the show honors clear of the rest. SAGUARO ROW chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. BRIDLEWOOD CAT broke out at the start bumping PACIFIC
GALE, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn put to coaxing three furlongs out, swung four wide
for home and weakened. LADY NINJA inside briefly, tipped out to chased three then two wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into
upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
HOLD THE SALSA stalked the pace three wide, inched up towards the ones to catch during the run around the bend, got roused swinging into the four path
heading home being, closed in resolutely on the leader, struck the front end in deep stretch, then dug in to preserve the decision. IT'S GRAVY took up the
chase from path two, was worked into the fifth one from upper to midstretch, closed in with willingness, came up short. MARKET ALERT vied for command
towards path two during the initial stages, was more on the inside route coming into the stretch, gave in to the winner with under a sixteenth to go, stayed on
for the show. WINDY NATIONS came in losing his footing springing from the gate, travelled four wide on the turn, got sent out into path six from upper
stretch, gained well enough to earn the last major check. PROSPECT MOUNTAIN saved ground until the end of the bend, got maneuvered into path six
once in the stretch, made no impact. HORN OF PLENTY brushed at the start, settled into midpack, raced three wide on the turn, was put to urging spinning
about as wide into the stretch, lacked the necessary response. DREAMER'S DISEASE stumbled badly at the start, appeared keen while advancing
afterwards towards the front end, argued for command until midstretch, then gave way. THE KING CHEEK a forward factor from along the inside route,
faltered. NEW YORK ONE faltered off a ground-saving journey. JACOBA pinched at the start, left the backstretch from the two path, was never in it. JACKS
AMERICAN PIE two wide at the top of the turn, failed to contend.
