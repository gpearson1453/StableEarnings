Footnotes
HATTIES JEWEL dueled from the outside early, remained engaged up the backstretch, fought through the second turn, shook loose entering the drive and
was well clear late while under steady urging. STARSHIP ZEUS stalked the early pace from the outside, advanced through the second turn, responded
entering the drive but could not reach the winner. CHAOSMOS well placed early from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded when
asked and was just up for the show. MAGNANIMUS MAN chased the early pace outside, dueled up the backstretch but had nothing for the drive. BET
AGAIN dueled from between foes and tired. DREWSIZZLE was no factor. SI FAMILIA was no threat. THAT'S D 'CAT dueled from the outside and faded.
ALPHA TO OMEGA dueled from the inside and gave way. LOOKIE LOO trailed throughout.

READS LANDING broke sharp from between foes to quickly gain the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, continued to show the way through
the second turn, widen the effort at the eighth pole and was well clear while under steady urging. VICKSLINCOLNLAWYER well placed from the outside,
advanced through the second turn, responded when sat down for the drive and was just up for the place. MACHO MARK outrun early, steadily advanced
outside through the second turn, responded but just missed the place. WHEELS TURNING unhurried early from the outside, inched closer entering the
second turn, responded and had a late gain. WAYPOINT forced the early pace outside but came up empty in the drive. VELVET RIDGE chased the early
pace outside and tired. OUT MAKING TREBLE was no factor. VALENZANO was no threat. MY BLARNEY STONE was finished after going a half. First
quarter split time unavailable due to a timer malfunction.

ACADEMY BAY the final furlong. ACADEMY BAY chased the early pace from the outside, crept closer entering the second turn, responded to gain a clear
margin at the eighth pole but could not last. WHY GOD unhurried early from the inside, advanced through the second turn, responded to pressure and
closed with a rush for the show. STEPPIN' OUTONHER forced the early pace outside but had nothing for the drive. BLAME THE THIEF went evenly. GONE
PREACHIN was no factor. ONEHOLYLION broke sharp from between foes, gained a clear early margin, remained clear up the backstretch then faded in

Footnotes
ASHLEY'S NEW SHOES stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, responded to duel through the second turn,
remained engaged through the drive, responded and inched clear late. AURA unhurried early from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch,
inched closer entering the second turn, responded when sat down for the drive but could not reach the winner. SEVEN JEWELS dueled from the outside
early, battled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the second turn but could not keep pace in the drive. FLATOYA dueled from the inside early,
remained engaged up the backstretch, held a forward position for the drive but tired. THE AURELIA FACTOR was steadied into the first turn when in tight
then went evenly. BELLA MOON was steadied into the first turn when in tight and no factor. HERO OF GOLD was no threat. NAUGHTY JUSTICE was
forced out into the first turn and no menace. LUCKY LITTLE LADY had a steady fade. JEWELED CROWN drifted out into the first turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
LEO DEL REO dueled from between foes early, battled through the turn, gained a clear margin at the eighth pole and held sway. RISKEY TRICKEY dueled
from the inside early, remained engaged through the turn but could not match strides in the drive. GOLDEN TIGER up close early from the outside, dueled
through the turn, remained forward but just lasted for the show. CHITTO outrun early, advanced inside through the turn, responded and rallied but too late.
CUSTOM READY went evenly. BRAVE RIFLE was no factor. OUACHITA was no menace. KENSLEY'S HIPPIE chased the early pace and faded in the
drive.
