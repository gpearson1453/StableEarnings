Footnotes
COMMISSIONER DAVE, off slow, was three wide early and then two wide on the final turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed and was just up.
GALLIC WAR set the pace inside, drifted out through stretch and just failed. SMART PROSPECT stalked two wide, also drifted out through stretch and held
on gamely. RAILROAD BILL, two wide early, challenged three wide near stretch, loomed boldly but then hung. PREFONTAINE saved ground in second
flight then tired. SHILOH LANE saved ground early, eased out and tired. SLAM BANG, between foes, had only brief speed. MAKEANENTRANCE was
never a factor.

PRESS MY BETS set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way on the turn, responded when roused at the top of the lane and held well under
urging. MOUNT TRAVERS tracked along the inside, advanced on the turn, rallied into the stretch, closed well but second best. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY hit
the gate and bumped with COZY LOVER at the start, then stalked three wide, chased on the turn and finished evenly. COZY LOVER was bumped at the
start and off slowly, raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. WENTZ stumbled at the start, chased two wide, chased on the turn
and tired. FRANK'SGUNISLOADED walked out of the gate, was pulled up and walked off. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, the race was declared
official.

Footnotes
GRAND OASIS angled to the rail entering the first turn, was between foes on the backstretch, swung very wide into stretch, closed and was along in time.
KNOKKE BY THE SEA was outrun racing outside, was very wide on final turn into stretch took the lead in deep stretch but was outfinished. JUPI'S
LIGHTNING, three wide and just off pace, challenged four wide into stretch, took the lead with a furlong to run then gave way grudgingly. SYNERGIZED
racing just off the rail setting the pace, was two wide on the final turn, bumped with LOUIE'S WISH entering the stretch and held on well. LOUIE'S WISH
was between rivals early, then was left with the rail, bumped with SYNERGIZED entering the stretch then faded. BILL'S MAFIA stalked two wide early,
moved out three wide into stretch and dropped back late. SURFER BOY GEORGE raced between rivals and failed to menace. SACRIFICING IT ALL, two
wide, was not a serious threat. PROUD AND FURIOUS broke slowly, was very rank early and showed nothing. OVERBOLD saved ground just off the early
pace then tired. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF KNOKKE BY THE SEA AGAINST GRAND OASIS FOR ALLEDGED INTERFERENCE INTO THE
FIRST TURN WAS QUICKLY DISMISSED.
