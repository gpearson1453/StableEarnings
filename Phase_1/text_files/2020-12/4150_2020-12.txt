Footnotes
CALL BROS broke outwardly and pushed REALTOR DANNY D into JUPITER BLUES, pressed the pace two wide, seized command near the quarter pole,
drew clear in upper stretch and held firm under a drive. JEALOUS EYES raced off the pace while going five around the first turn, remained in midpack while
just three deep around the far turn, angled further out in upper stretch and finished strongly. TREASURE RUN saved ground in range, angled out near the
quarter pole, bid in midstretch but was outkicked. BIG PERM raced four wide in midpack, angled in nearing the lane and was one-paced through the stretch.
REALTOR DANNY D was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. SIERRA CAT failed to menace while racing three and
four wide. REY DE LIGAS (CHI) set the pace along the rail, gave way near the quarter pole and was vanned off. FUTURE PRINCE was outrun inside.
JUPITER BLUES was bumped at the start, fought the bit through the opening half, raced three wide and made little impact. CAPTURE THE CROWN saved
ground and was through after a half.

Footnotes
SAY ADIOS pressed MS BIG SPRING from outside, took over with little difficulty five-sixteenths out, entered the stretch in the three-path and steadily drew
off under mild hand urging. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA raced two to three wide around the turn, and went clear late for second while never a threat to the
winner. BLESSED BEAST moved out five wide past the quarter-pole, and was along for the show outside. MS BIG SPRING set the pace inside, could not
match strides with the winner after a half-mile, and gave way. TALE OF V K broke out brushing PLAY THAT TONE, stayed close inside early, but faded
after a half. ITSENOUGH was outrun early three then four wide to the head of the lane, and made no headway on the far outside. PLAY THAT TONE
brushed with TALE OF V K at the start, and was outrun inside. MYFIRSTEXWIFE stayed in range three then four wide for a half, and faltered into the
stretch.

saved ground off the pace and stayed on to gain the show. SIDARTH raced off the pace two wide and passed tiring rivals. MASTER OF DISASTER was in
range five wide and lacked the needed rally. LITTLE DUDE dueled in the three path and tired in the stretch. EXXTOP raced in midpack two wide between
rivals, clipped heels near the five-sixteenths pole and had no further bids. GLOBALTROUBLECOCO was outrun while racing five wide. ROYAL MEETING
failed to menace while racing four wide. TRUE IDENTITY was outrun inside. CAPTAIN KIRK pressed the pace four wide, bolted in upper stretch, was pulled
up and walked off.

COWARDLY ACT bumped lightly with EL AFORTUNADO while away alertly, rated along on the lead inside, and was kept busy through the stretch.
HOUDINI'S AWESOME lacked room behind HAPPY CHAMP at the start, saved ground far back early, moved out four wide past the quarter-pole, and
rallied outside to get up for the place while attempting to lug in. EL AFORTUNADO was bumped between horses at the start, alternated between the rail and
the two-path much of the way, and finished evenly. MISTA DONZELLA broke out into HARD GAME, went along in the three-path much of the way, and
lacked a solid late response. PARTY OF NO prompted the pace outside the winner to the stretch, and tired. HARD GAME got bumped by MISTA
DONZELLA at the start, raced four wide into the first turn before moving in a bit, and played no part. SETTE STELLE broke out bumping EL AFORTUNADO
into COWARDLY ACT, saved ground and failed to menace. HAPPY CHAMP got herded out by UNIMPEACHED at the start, steadied first time through the
stretch, and was outrun three wide. THE ZIP FACTOR was never prominent. FEAR THE BROW broke slowly and was always far back. UNIMPEACHED
broke out causing crowding, steadied lacking room between horses into the first turn, and tired around the far turn three then four wide. CONFUCIO was
strung out five wide into the first turn, and stayed close for a half-mile before retreating on the far turn. This race was hand timed, fractional times
unavailable.

INCLUDE THE BEAST pressed the pace in the three path, asserted command turning for home and drew off under a drive. LIGHTS ON GIRL saved ground
behind the leaders and rallied inside of the pacesetter to gain the place late. SHE'S CLASSY set the pace in the two path under pressure from the winner,
could not keep pace from the quarter pole and lost second late. GREENWOOD DRIVE broke in and bumped MAK HERO at the start, chased the pace four
wide and lacked a rally. MISS ITALY never threatened while racing four wide. TEXAS REWARD chased the pace inside and faded after a half. MAK HERO
was soundly bumped at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DILLON ROCKS settled in the second flight early, swung five wide leaving the far turn, caught MEMORABLE from outside past the furlong marker and
drove clear. MEMORABLE was unhurried to the far turn, moved out three wide advancing into the stretch, briefly reached the front outside HERO UP near
the eighth-pole, could not withstand the winner and ran on clear of the rest. CONFORTO saved ground outrun for a half-mile, began to get going two wide
through upper stretch, rallied through between horses a sixteenth out and was up for the show. PRETENDANT raced two to three wide well back to the far
turn, and improved position without threatening. SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE tracked outside the leaders to the far turn, loomed three wide with a quarter-mile
remaining, but gave way through the late stages. SMELL OF ROSES was four wide early, remained out in the course coming off the far turn, and had no
response. HERO UP set the pace inside, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. EMBATTLED broke out bumping AYCAPOTE, prompted the pace
between horses, and was finished approaching the stretch. AYCAPOTE got bumped by EMBATTLED and steadied back at the start, and remained well in
arrears. MR. CESCO showed nothing at the back throughout.

Footnotes
GREYES CREEK stayed in range unhurried for six furlongs, was guided out four wide approaching the stretch, collared CLEAR DESTINATION from outside
under hand urging past the furlong marker, and edged clear late under a mild drive. CLEAR DESTINATION prompted the pace outside INVENTING
BLAME, took over after six furlongs and edged away, could not resist the winner into the last furlong but stayed on well. SCRAPS saved ground to the far
turn, moved out four wide at the top of the stretch, and rallied willingly between horses to take a multi-horse show photo. DREAM LINER (BRZ) steadied
behind KINGMEISTER first time through the stretch, trailed for six furlongs near the inside, angled widest into the lane and gained gradually.
SUCCEEDANDSURPASS (IRE) settled near the three-path in the second flight, shifted out five wide leaving the far turn and finished one-paced.
KINGMEISTER ranged up three wide to loom a threat on the far turn, but flattened out through the late stages. GRAND JOURNEY was three wide near the
back to the stretch, and failed to respond. SAND DANCER was forwardly placed inside to the stretch, and weakened. ARMY SCOUT was never prominent.
INVENTING BLAME cleared to the early lead inside, relinquished command to CLEAR DESTINATION on the far turn, and retreated.

Footnotes
ALWAYS SHOPPING tracked the pace three wide, seized command near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. GREAT ISLAND settled off the pace
while racing three wide around both turns, made progress in upper stretch, came out under left-handed urging in midstretch and shut off CAP DE CREUS,
straightened out soon after and stayed on evenly to maintain the place. CAP DE CREUS was bumped at the start, was unhurried inside, angled out nearing
the quarter pole, began to rally in upper stretch, was forced to check and alter out in midstretch, regained some momentum and gained third late.
TRAIPSING set a firmly rated pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. KELSEY'S CROSS bumped with CAP DE CREUS at the start, hugged the rail
well back, swung out in upper stretch and improved position. CAMBELIZA raced off the pace two wide early, went three wide around the far turn, swung
widest in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. COURT RETURN never threatened while racing two wide. GUN SOCIETY saved ground in range and
came up empty in the lane. LADY PANDA prompted the pace two wide and tired in the drive. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF CAP
DE CREUS, GREAT ISLAND WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD FOR INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH.

Footnotes
SLEEPY EYES TODD saved ground advancing a bit midway on the turn, moved out to take a run at WIND OF CHANGE through the furlong grounds, came
away with the lead a sixteenth out, and held off FIRENZE FIRE under good handling. FIRENZE FIRE was allowed to settle early two then three wide, rallied
gamely outside SLEEPY EYES TODD in deep stretch but could not get by. MIND CONTROL broke alertly and secured striking position outside, came four
wide rallying into the lane, but was outkicked outside the top two. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) dashed clear after the start, rambled along setting a brisk pace
to the stretch, and yielded on the rail through the last furlong. COOL ARROW chased the pacesetter two to three wide, and weakened coming to mid
stretch. HAIKAL broke out bumping MAJESTIC DUNHILL, lagged well back to the stretch, and improved on the far outside. LASTING LEGACY was ridden
along up the backstretch, steadied slightly past the half-mile marker, moved out five wide at the top of the stretch, and could not gain. LAST JUDGMENT
bumped with MAJESTIC DUNHILL at the start, and was outrun inside. DIAMOND OOPS raced three to four wide, and had no apparent mishaps.
MAJESTIC DUNHILL got bounced around between HAIKAL and LAST JUDGMENT at the break, moved out five wide approaching the stretch and could not
gain. EBBEN moved inside early, and showed little. ZENDEN raced two to three wide, and was through before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY PHAROAH set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. HE'SPUREGOLD saved ground in midpack,
went two wide around the far turn and finished willingly to gain the place without threatening the winner. COURAGEOUSLY prompted the winner two wide,
could not keep pace in upper stretch and held well enough for the show. GIRL DAD tracked the pace from the rail and lacked a rally. ADVANCED
PLACEMENT was bumped hard between foes early, raced far back two wide, angled out nearing the lane and had a belated rally. MUNQAD stalked the
pace three wide and weakened in the lane. PUBLIC INFORMATION raced two wide in midpack for a half, made some progress four wide around the far
turn but faded in the stretch. NOT STORMY was bumped hard soon after the start, saved ground off the early pace, went three wide around the far turn and
made little impact. VAN DUSEN (GB) was bumped early, raced two wide around both turns and never threatened. ULTIMATE GIFT was fractious in the
starting gate, stumbled a few strides out of the gate, came out and caused a chain reaction of bumping, saved ground and played no further factor. This
race was hand timed.
