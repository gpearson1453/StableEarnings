Footnotes
COWORTH PARK was allowed to settle in midpack early, swung five wide getting in gear past the quarter-pole, collared the leaders from outside entering
the final furlong and drew off under a mild drive. CRYSTAL COAST tucked in behind the early leaders, moved off the inside leaving the far turn, bid between
horses through the furlong grounds, could not kick on with the winner but finished well to best the others. SWEET FELICIA prompted the early pace
between horses, challenged outside NINJA KITTEN on the far turn, weakened past the eighth-pole and had enough to save the show. GREY CHARLOTTE
raced three then four wide for six furlongs, and offered a mild response for the last major share. TAMI'S ORCHID bumped with WILD WALKOFF at the start,
raced near the two-path much of the way, and improved position without menacing. HARDLY SOCIAL raced in range three wide to the far turn, loomed a
threat into the lane but flattened out with a furlong remaining. NINJA KITTEN was nursed along on a short lead inside rivals for six furlongs, and gave way
through the last eighth of a mile. LUCI BREEZE raced near the back two wide to the far turn, moved inside into the stretch and had no response. WILD
WALKOFF bumped with TAMI'S ORCHID at the start and was last away, and was outrun three wide. LEARNT tired inside after six furlongs. METAFORA
was strung out four wide throughout, and had nothing left into the stretch. PATRONUS prompted the pace three wide to the far turn, and retreated.

Footnotes
BAILEY stalked three wide early on, vied outside of only NO COMMISSION around the turn, assumed command from that foe passing the three sixteenths
pole, and drew off through the final furlong under driving pressure. NO COMMISSION rushed to set the pace along the inside after a bit of a flat footed start,
showed the way inside of the eventual winner around the turn, dug in to resist that foe turning for home, but gave way passing the furlong marker.
CONVERTER chased along the inside while under steady urging, saved ground around the turn, but proved no match for leading foes turning for home, and
was the best of the rest of the group. LAST MINUTE DEAL saved ground off of the pace while under urging, but failed to threaten. PRINCE TRITON
pressed the pace setter two wide and between horses early on, but failed to keep pace with those foes passing the half mile pole, chased them from the
three path around the turn, then tired through the lane. YOUNG FLINT brushed the gate at the start, lied far off of the pace in the three to two path around
the turn, and failed to make an impact. FULL SEND raced far off of the pace two wide and between horses into the turn, and never got involved. POLITICAL
RIOT was caught five wide around the turn while far off of the pace, and failed to factor. MONEY SONG tracked from midpack in the four path around the
turn, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
BELLA CIAO was unhurried early inside, angled to the four-path coming off the turn, was forced out wider challenging for command outside HIGH ON GIN
near the eighth-pole, brushed with that rival and prevailed after a stiff drive. HIGH ON GIN veered out sharply at the break, moved up inside through the run
up the backstretch, waited behind the leaders on the turn before being guided out three wide, drifted out and brushed with BELLA CIAO as they rallied in
tandem a furlong out, and battled gamely to the finish. ELUSIVE MOLLY pressed the pace outside YES FACTOR, challenged for command approaching the
stretch, then gave way inside the top two finishers past the eighth-pole. INEDATEQUILA raced two then three wide around the turn, and lacked the needed
late response. YES FACTOR set a pressured pace inside for six furlongs, and weakened through the stretch. BAYDAR tracked outside the early leaders,
and drifted wide faltering after six furlongs.

Footnotes
CHEERLEADER BARB stalked along the inside, loomed in hand from the pocket around the far turn, smoothly tipped two wide turning for home, bid for the
lead inside of the furlong pole, and drew clear. IRAZU hopped a bit at the start, lied far off of the pace in the two path, shied a bit from ISLA BONITA's
incident around the first turn, advanced while holding the two path around the far turn, glided five wide through upper stretch, and rallied for place. UNION
PARK GAL (IRE) stalked along the inside, inherited an advantage down the backstretch as the leader was restrained back, showed the way around the far
turn, scooted clear briefly in upper stretch, but had little resistance for the winner's bid inside of the furlong marker, and tired. TAP TAP BIRDIE lied off of the
pace along the inside, then from the two to three path around the far turn before floating five wide in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly for a minor share.
PANOTTI stalked the clear leader from the four to three path around the first turn, moved inside of that foe down the backstretch and prompted UNION
PARK GAL (IRE) from the outside around the far turn, but appeared to shy out a path turning for home causing her to brush JULIE BIRD (IRE) at the three
sixteenths pole, and gave way in upper stretch. JULIE BIRD (IRE) lied forwardly placed two to three wide around the turns, but was brushed to the four path
by an inner foe while attempting a bid turning for home, then lacked a kick and faltered through the lane. KETCHIKAN lied off of the pace while caught in the
four path around the first turn, tucked to the rail into the far turn, saved ground around that bend allowing for improvement, but failed to menace through the
lane. SHAKEM tracked from midpack in the three to four paths, got floated six wide in upper stretch, and lacked a rally. OKALANI rated far off of the pace in
the three path around the turns, and failed to factor. ISLA BONITA was off slowly, lied far off of the the pace along the inside, appeared to bump the rail
around the first turn causing him to loose action, then took the far turn in the three path and failed to factor. BABY LION was outrun. BROADWAY DIVA
pulled clear in the three path while very headstrong around the first turn, was guided to the six path into the backstretch to attempt to settle, but was
restrained back, then stayed wide while faltering around the far turn and was done early.

Footnotes
AKOR saved ground in striking range for three furlongs, moved to the two-path drawing a bead on SWEETSWEETSWEET in upper stretch, forged past
from outside a sixteenth out and edged away hand urged and shown the whip. SHIKAKA broke out bumping MO ME MO MY at the break, then bumped
with BELLA BIONDA a stride after that, hugged the rail near the back to the stretch, slid out to the four-path with a furlong to run and finished with good
energy outside rivals. SWEETSWEETSWEET sprinted clear early, relinquished command to the winner in deep stretch and had enough to salvage third.
MO ME MO MY got bumped by SHIKAKA at the start, saved ground advancing into the stretch, but could not sustain the rally. CLASSY BEAST stayed in
range early between horses two then three wide, and finished one-paced. DRYNACHAN steadied and lost position four then three wide midway on the turn,
moved in through upper stretch and lacked a response. QUEEN ABARRIO raced two wide and failed to menace. ZIP IT JESS pressed the pace outside
SWEETSWEETSWEET, lodged a mild bid at the top of the stretch, and faded. CAFFEINE RUSH tired four wide after three-eighths of a mile. BELLA
BIONDA hit the left side of the gate coming out, then bumped with SHIKAKA, and never got close. YELLEN pursued the leaders three wide, and was
finished leaving the turn.

Footnotes
BRASSTOWN set the pace along the inside, widened his advantage approaching the five sixteenths pole, and was kept to steady driving pressure to the
wire to seal the deal. TURN ON THE MAGIC was off slowly and raced far off of the pace, then rallied in the four path through the lane to achieve place late.
BENEFACTOR stalked along the inside, forged place turning for home while proving no match for the winner, but was worn down for that position in the late
stages. SKYSCANNER trailed early on, then passed tired foes without threatening. OUTSHINE was never involved. HAN SENSE pressed two wide early
on, but failed to keep pace with the leader approaching the five sixteenths pole, stopped while being eased through the lane, and walked across the wire.

Footnotes
COLONEL TOM saved ground in the second flight for three furlongs, tipped smoothly to the two-path coming to the eighth-pole, caught EARTH from outside
and forged clear late. OAK BLUFFS was outsprinted early, swung four wide leaving the turn, and finished well outside. EARTH sprinted clear early, could
not withstand the winner a sixteenth out and gave way on the rail. APACHE BRAVE broke a step slow and was well back early, rallied in traffic between
horses through mid stretch, and bumped with DISCRETIONARY MARQ late. DISCRETIONARY MARQ tracked outside the leaders four wide to the stretch,
lacked a solid closing response and bumped with APACHE BRAVE about 70 yards out. GRAN MALBEC settled in midpack three wide to the stretch, and
checked in heavy traffic past the furlong marker. MARCELINO raced four to five wide at the back to the stretch, and gained without threatening.
ARCHIVERO lacked the needed response two wide. MAR VISTA MIGUEL chased the pacesetter two wide between horses to the stretch, and faded.
OHANZEE was no factor three to four wide. LIKE WHAT I SEE chased the leaders three wide to the top of the stretch, and had nothing left. SMOKE 'N'
GLOAT was outrun inside.

Footnotes
RECODED dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes early on, dug in turning for home as HEIRESSINDY made a menacing bid, but dueled gamely through
the lane while maintaining a margin, and held resolute. HEIRESSINDY hopped a bit at the start, stalked two wide, split foes turning for home to make a bid
for the lead at the quarter pole outside of RECODED, dueled with that foe through the lane while trying to reach even terms, but was denied. GLOBAL
AMBITION stalked along the inside, tipped three wide while just behind the leading duelers passing the three sixteenths pole, but did not have enough to
produce a bid and only chased them home. ALIZEE was off a bit awkwardly and trailed the field three wide into the turn, rallied five wide turning for home,
but leveled off before threatening. PERSPIRE prompted the leading duelers four wide, but failed to keep pace with them passing the three furlong pole,
chased them four wide turning for home, but faltered. PUPPET MASTER saved ground off of the pace, shifted six wide through upper stretch, but failed to
get involved. SAMMIE SUNSHINE dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened turning for home. ABILENE TRAIL lied far off of the
pace two wide, but failed to factor before being eased through the lane. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED, THE SEVEN
FURLONG FRACTION IS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
SHAMROCKET was under a firm hold on the first turn behind and between foes, advanced four wide after six furlongs, kicked in rallying outside the leaders
past the eighth-pole and edged away late. MY POINT EXACTLY prompted KROY from outside, challenged for command on the far turn, battled between
horses through the lane and stayed on stubbornly. FREEDOM MATTERS raced three wide, loomed a threat a quarter-mile out, fought on to deep stretch
and was outfinished. KROY established an easy pace inside for six furlongs, and was overrun through the late stages. SOUPER WATSON saved ground
forwardly placed to the stretch, and finished one-paced. GEARHEAD was outrun early inside, moved out four then five wide on the far turn, and improved
without making an impact. MONY raced two to three wide in range for six furlongs, but made no headway through the lane. TOTONO was no factor inside.
CERRADO raced three wide and posed no threat. MOZO BELLO raced two wide on the turns, and lacked a solid response.

Footnotes
WEEKEND DREAMER set the pace outside of MONTE NE early on, cleared off from that rival and shifted down to the rail into the turn, then determinedly
held off that foe's rebid through the late stages. MONTE NE vied inside of the eventual winner early on, allowed that foe to clear into the turn, stalked him
from the two path around the bend, then chased him through the lane while grinding away at his advantage, but did not have enough to catch him late.
SURPRISE FACTOR chased four wide around the turn, got floated five wide turning for home, then prevailed for show under a long drive without
threatening the leaders. CAPITAN FOFO lied forwardly placed along the inside, swung three wide straightening into the lane, vied for show thereafter while
not progressing on the leaders, drifted inwards and across WILD ONE FOREVER's path approaching the sixteenth pole, causing other foes to steady as
well in the process, then got outfinished for that position. FRENCH REEF (IRE) was taken up in hand early on while among traffic, scooted through to track
from midpack two wide and between horses into the turn, awaited racing room turning for home before committing to the two path to vie for show in upper
stretch between rivals, but hung on his left lead through the lane and flattened out. MR NAPPY stalked from the three path around the turn, got floated four
wide turning for home, but hung on his left lead through the lane and faded. ALL INCLUSIVE saved ground off of the pace, advanced turning for home by
hugging the fence to vie for show in upper stretch, but flattened out under light urging through the late stages. WILD ONE FOREVER lied far off of the pace
in the two path before shifting to the four path turning for home, tipped inwards a bit passing the furlong marker to attempt a rally inside of CAPITAN FOFO,
but steadied when that foe drifted across his path approaching the sixteenth pole, shied inwards and across other rivals' lanes due to the incident, and was
protected thereafter. COLD WARRIOR trailed two wide around the turn, came into the lane in the three path, then failed to produce a bid before being taken
in hand at the sixteenth pole when WILD ONE FOREVER shied across his path. MISTER KELLY tracked from midpack while caught five wide around the
turn, and faltered through the lane. CAPTAIN DUKE saved ground at the rear of the field, shifted off of the fence to attempt a rally in upper stretch, but
steadied when WILD ONE FOREVER shied almost into his path at the sixteenth pole. SAGE CANYON hesitated at the start, lied far off of the pace in the
four path around the turn, and never got involved.
