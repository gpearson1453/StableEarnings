Footnotes
KITE SURFER rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, then
dug in under steady stretch encouragement to just last. BOP MARLEY saved ground off the pace the first turn then eased out entering the backstretch, bid
nearing the three eighths pole and raced four wide on the far turn, dug in to steady stretch encouragement, finished well and just missed. LUCKY PENGUIN
settled just off the pace and off the rail, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, eased five wide into the
stretch and got up for third later yards. CHAMPAGNE JAM raced off the pace about the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and angled to the seven path on the far turn but could only improve his position. BE BE BOP raced in the four path the first turn, challenged
toward the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms three wide on the far turn, but dropped back into the stretch and weakened. RIDING CLOUD
NINE rounded the opening turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole but showed little
response. FAPPIANO ROCKET stalked the pace off the rail, challenged from the seven sixteenths pole and dueled between horses through the
backstretch, but dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened.

AUBURN MILL set a pressured pace toward the inside, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, dueled clear into the stretch and was steadily
handled to hold on well. WEAVE IT QUIXOTE closed to the heels of Auburn Mill and raced hemmed in past the three eighths pole, recovered stride past the
quarter, was carried to the five path toward the top of the stretch, closed for second mid-stretch and finished well. BECOMING SMITTY pressured the pace
through the backstretch and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, but, drifted out toward the head of the lane and flattened stride the
final sixteenth. OFFICER UNBRIDLED chased the pace, rounded the turn in the six path and closed the gap through the lane. ASK ME HOW IKNOW gave
chase, raced at the rail on the turn then weakened. COCKY WINCHILL was slow into stride, never factored and rounded the turn about the four path.
MEDAL GENIUS was slow getting into stride then saved ground.

LIKE SEGAL was hustled to the lead and set a pressured pace, widened on the turn and proved much the best. MACY'S BOY chased the pace toward the
inside, angled to the four path approaching the head of the lane then dug in to take second inside the sixteenth pole. HEATED chased the pace and
rounded the turn just off the rail, then yielded second mid-stretch. WICKED PRANKSTER pressured the pace, raced at the rail on the turn then weakened.
BOSEY came away a step slow then saved ground. DUNN DEAL chased the pace inside then veered wide to get around Beat Navy midway on the turn.
LAST PARTY broke a step slow and saved ground. Racing without front shoes, BEAT NAVY gave chase through the backstretch but pulled up lame
midway on the turn and was vanned off.

Footnotes
FIREBIRD chased the early pace toward the inside, raced at the rail rounding the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, dug in for the lead later yards and
raced clear nearing the wire. DASHIELL chased the pace and dueled close three wide on the turn, took the lead past the eighth pole and raced briefly clear,
but was caught mid-stretch and relented later yards. READY TO RUN pressured the pace inside and raced at the rail on the turn, angled three wide leaving
the turn and finished evenly. WINDSOR CALLING chased outside and raced in the six path of the turn, then finished evenly outside. MUSTA NEVER MET
U hesitated at the break then picked up the chase leaving the chute, rounded the turn just off the rail and finished evenly. FROSTY'S MAJESTY chased
from the outside, rounded the turn about the five path then flattened later yards. CARTHAGE dropped back soon after the start. I'M ABLE took the lead
nearing the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the turn, was caught past the eighth pole and gave way.

Footnotes
SCHLOSSER took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, raced at the rail on the far turn, came under pressure
into the stretch but finished the final sixteenth with a hand ride. RELENTLESS STRIKE drafted the winner through the first turn then picked up the chase
approaching the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and dug in through the lane to hold on for second. IHEARUKNOCKIN settled off the
pace about the three path, eased out with a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five path, finished evenly and was gaining
on the runner-up. PRINCE OF WINDSOR rounded the first turn in the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid approaching the three
eighths pole, continued in the four path of the far turn then flattened out the final sixteenth. DEDICATED raced off the pace and off the rail the opening turn,
left the turn toward the outside and showed little response. CENT COMM was off slowly and raced well back. LOOKS GOOD stalked the early pace about
the three path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but gave way at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
OCEAN LILLY stalked the pace from the two and three paths, challenged toward the three eighths pole and dueled at even terms from that point, took the
nod at the five sixteenths and drew clear of Technique Only past the quarter, then steadily increased her margin. DEVILISH BEAUTY came away a step
slow and raced in the five path the opening turn, settled close into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
in the three path then dueled through the stretch for second. LADY MADISON raced boxed at the rail the first turn and settled close into the backstretch,
gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. MABEL settled off the pace
and off the rail, bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn, angled to the five path into the lane and finished evenly.
TECHNIQUE ONLY rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths and dueled at even terms from that point, gave up the nod
nearing the five sixteenths, dropped back at the rail past the quarter then weakened. IT'SMYINTENSION saved ground the first turn and showed little
response through the backstretch. NORTHERN HEAT rounded the first turn in the six and seven paths and showed little response. HOT POSSEBILITY
saved early ground and was not a factor. BEYOND PRETTY rounded the opening turn in the six path, raced outside into the backstretch and was through
after a half mile.

Footnotes
ESTHER'S FORTUNE stalked from the three path then bid past the half mile pole, steadily progressed to take over two deep midway on the far turn and
was steadily handled to hold on well. OLD LINE MAGIC angled to the inside to rate a slim lead, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole and
dueled clear of CONGA IN PARIS approaching the quarter, but was caught midway through the far turn and had to settle for second; while the latter raced
with the pace two deep and challenged toward the three eighths pole, dropped back approaching the quarter and weakened the final furlong.
UNEXPECTEDLY saved ground the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three
path of the far turn and showed little further. FLICKER'S PRINCESS saved ground the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. J C
THE DESTROYER raced off the early pace in the two and three paths and showed little response down the backstretch. LANGLEY GIRL raced well off the
pace.
