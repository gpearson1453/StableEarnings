Footnotes
REASSURED was unhurried early on, raced towards the inside down the backstretch, moved up four wide at the quarter pole and finished well to be well
clear under an energetic hand ride. STEADY EDDIE tracked the early leader while racing two wide, continued to raced just off the in the inside in the stretch
and was no match for the winner in the drive. ALOYSIUS LUCK stalked the pace along the inside, moved up three wide through the lane and had not
enough. FEROCIOUS STORM was quick to begin to set all the pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile. LIGHTNING ROD was slow early on, raced
three wide at the eighth pole and failed to have a response. DANDY YANKEE settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside and never was a factor.
SAM IN STYLE raced four wide into the upper stretch and showed little.

MAKIN' OUT stalked the pace, raced four wide nearing the eighth pole and drew off in the final stages under strong encouragement. PETION LASS was
allowed to settle early, moved up along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and was no match for the winner in the drive. BRING ME
ANSWERS was unhurried early, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and finished well to be closing in late. FOLK MAGIC showed good early speed to
set all the pace, raced off the inside through the stretch and weakened. OWESAYCANYOUSEE was forwardly placed early on, raced five deep through the
stretch and tired. LIFE IN FLASH settled off the early pace, raced three wide at the eighth pole and had no response. DANCINGWITHPAYNTER dropped
back early, saved ground and never threatened.

DIXIE DRAWL was ridden along down the backstretch while racing two wide, pressed the leader entering the far turn, raced in the four path through the
stretch and held gamely under strong encouragement. PLOT THE DOTS stalked the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and finished second best.
TATTOOED was allowed to settle early, saved ground around the far turn, angled off the rail into the upper stretch, tried to split rivals just past the the
sixteenths pole, was blocked and finished willingly to the wire. COLONEL JUAN was slow early, raced five wide at the eighth pole and had not enough in the
drive. BEYOND THE VICTORY set all the pace and weakened a bit while racing along the inside. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY dropped back early, saved ground
and never threatened.

stretch and slowly closed in on the latter stages. ESCAPE, off slow after stumbling, was unhurried early on, raced five wide in the lane and had not enough
in the drive. TASTES LIKE PLAID was slow early, raced six wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. PYSER'S ORB, checked early, dropped back
some around the turn and failed to respond. TAUBER settled towards the back early, raced five wide at the three sixteenths pole and had no response. NO

PAY THE KID stalked the early pace, found room along the inside near the upper stretch and finished well to be clear under strong urging. BURGESS was
unhurried early, raced along the inside around the turn through the stretch and finished second best. FAVOR MAKER dropped back early, angled six wide
into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. MAXIMO STRONG was bumped at the break, set all the pace down the backstretch and gave way in the
drive. IMAGINETHEJOY was bumped at the break, raced four wide at the quarter pole and had no final bid. DON CICCIO stalked the pace near the inside
and faded. NEVERFOLD settled off the early pace, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. JUSTACALLAWAY was shuffled back at
the break, saved ground and had no response. ORBONTHEBAYOU raced up close early while racing three deep and failed to sustain a bid. KING PACAY
raced seven wide at the three sixteenths pole and never menaced.

Footnotes
MISS LESLIE was allowed to settle early on, moved up strongly around the far turn, raced six deep at the quarter pole, jockey lost his whip nearing the
eighth pole and drew off to be well clear under an energetic hand ride. BREEZE OFF THE BAY stalked the early pace, awaited room into the lane, found
room just inside the upper stretch but was no match for the winner in the drive. ADELAIDE MISS stalked the pace, raced five wide at the quarter pole and
had no final winning bid. MIT MAZEL was slow early, raced five wide past the eighth pole and never was a factor. PROPER ATTIRE was quick to begin to
set all the pace and gave way. MISS WILD stalked the pace, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and failed to sustain a bid. LAZARETTE raced up
close early and tired readily.
