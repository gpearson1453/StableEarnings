Footnotes
SOUND CHECKERS chased clear leader two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, eased out into the three path in the stretch, responded to
urging and proved best late. PETER ALAN cleared rivals on the backstretch, entered turn clear, took turn much better tonight and entered stretch clear,
responded to urging and led past the 1/16, could not hold off the rallying outside rival and gave way late. TRES CHIFLADOS chased leader along the inside
on backstretch entered turn near rail and found room at top of the stretch along the rail, outkicked by top two in deep stretch to finish a well clear third.
ZINZAN hit outside part of the gate and came out very slow, stayed along the inside throughout and never launched a bid. AUTISMONEFORTYFIVE lacked
any speed early and quickly fell far off the pace, never threatened thereafter. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED
