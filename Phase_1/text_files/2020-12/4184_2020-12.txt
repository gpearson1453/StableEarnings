Footnotes
AREYOUINABAND broke sharp from between foes, quickly gained the early margin, remained clear through the turn, widen the effort at the eighth pole and
was well clear while lightly roused. HERE COMES LINDA squeezed at the start, chased the early pace from the inside, made a bid entering the turn but was
no match late while holding the place. RARE ONE forced the early pace from the inside but could not keep pace in the drive. IAM DAKOTA hopped at the
start, was outrun early, advanced outside through the turn but was too late. KATHLEEN'S DAY went evenly. QUEEZER could only pass tired ones.
BLESSED VILLANA was no factor. STRAWBERRY SUMMER was no threat. TOGAROCK was no menace. WHY NOT DANA flashed early speed and
faded.

Footnotes
SILENT FORCE dueled from the inside early, dropped back entering the first turn, inched closer entering the second turn, angled outside, responded and
wore down DEBONNAIRE DUDE the final furlong. DEBONNAIRE DUDE unhurried early from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, responded
entering the drive, gained a clear margin at the eighth pole but could not last. VALIANT DEFENDER forced the early pace from the inside, inched closer
entering the second turn but could only hold position. FAST DUDE dueled from the outside early, remained engaged up the backstretch but had nothing left.
DRAX could only improve position. RACIN ROCKS could only pass tired ones. CHARMING BULLET was no factor. DATA CENTRAL was no threat.
IT'SUPTOYOUPAL pressed the early pace outside and faded. DON'T LOOK dueled from between rivals and gave way.

Footnotes
MR LEO dueled from the inside early, remained engaged up the backstretch, shook loose entering the second turn, opened a clear margin at the eighth
pole and was clear late while kept to task. OBSTRUCTED VIEW dueled from the outside early, battled up the backstretch, remained forward for the drive
but was no match for the winner while clearly second best. LIGHTNING HARBOUR pressed the early pace outside, made a bid entering the second turn,
responded and was along for the show. TRAELEE forced the early pace outside but came up empty in the drive. DURITZ went evenly. CLEVER PRINCE
was off slow and no factor. CLASSIC EMMETT was never close. MORO PHAROAH was no menace. RICHARDS DREAM showed little.

APPLEWOOD stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a forward position entering the second turn, dueled
through the second turn, remained engaged for the drive and outfinished his rival late. HONOR MY SPEED broke sharp from the inside, gained a clear early
margin, remained clear up the backstretch, was engaged entering the second turn, dueled through the drive but was outfinished. SAVED AT SEA unhurried
early from the outside, steadily advanced through the second turn, responded and was just up for the show. PORT HUNTER pressed the early pace inside
but had nothing for the drive. CLEAR THE NILE could only improve position. MUCHO MARVIN chased the early pace and tired. GRAN RED was no real
factor. TONIGHTS STAR was never close. OPPORTUNITY COST forced the early pace inside and faded. EXPECT ICE had little interest.

Footnotes
DIVA'S RANSOM up close early from the inside, chased the early pace through the turn, responded entering the drive, dueled through the drive and was
just up the final strides. COOL SPRING chased the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, responded to duel through the drive but was
outfinished. CHARZEE BABY pressed the early pace from the outside, made a bid entering the turn and closed with a rush for the show. SUNSHINE
DEELITE chased the early pace outside but had nothing for the drive. HICLASS PRODUCTION was never close. LADY HOPPER broke sharp from the
outside, gained the early margin, remained clear through the turn, was engaged for the drive then gave way. SING THE SONG was never a factor.
