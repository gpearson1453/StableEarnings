Footnotes
EXCELLORATOR shook off some light contact with CENTAVO in the shadow of the starting gate to assume a forward position, was held in reserve stalking
the leader from the three path on the turn, inched up to the one to catch as the half was being completed, got revved up, confiscated the two path from
another in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, that opponent shortly thereafter to begin a steady retreat, struck the front narrowly coming up to the
eighth pole, edged away then held late to preserve the decision. RISKY WOODS sent over to the rail approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, fanned
out into path five from upper stretch, had a good finish down the center of the strip to garner the place. STIMULUS MAKER away the tardiest after
stutter-stepping its way out of the gate, travelled towards the three path during the run around the bend, got sent out six wide for the drive home, rallied for
third. SINASHACK rode the cover of the pacesetter for the majority of the opening half, cut the corner into the stretch, angled to be outside the tiring former
leader with approximately a sixteenth to go, went to earn the last major check. CENTAVO brushed at the start, pursued the front runners two to three wide
on the turn, got steered out into path four wide for the stretch run, rallied mildly. DOCTOR K established the top in short order, showed the way from the
inside route, well rated on a loosely-contested advantage, was turned loose for the stretch drive, relinquished deep into the furlong grounds, weakened.
ROCCO STRONG rode the rail for the initial half, tipped out into the two path stepping onto the head of the stretch, lacked the necessary response.
KENTUCKY KNIGHT moved into the two path on the backstretch, chased the pace from between foes for much of the journey leading up to the end of the
bend, lost position to the winner in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, backed away steadily almost immediately afterwards. PRODUCTION
CREDIT two wide entering the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, launched no bids. All riders carried an additional two pounds in
accordance with a weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
MAGNETIQUE three wide in pursuit, advanced on the front through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch
taking over command straightened away, edged clear under a drive to prevail. SECRET ZAR coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside down the
backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a
mild kick. PRINCESS PINKY prompted the leader from the two path under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in
the late stages. MORE MANGO chased three to four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position.
TUFF BIRD established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from PRINCESS PINKY to the outside, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths as the eventual winner ranged up three wide, swung three to four wide for home, yielded the front straightened away and tired.
GIRARDI chased two to three wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. BIG AL'S GAL brushed the off side
stall at the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
SADIE LADY away without apparent mishap, established control in short order, rated kind carving out the pace in the neighborhood of path two, was called
upon for more coming up to the three-sixteenths pole, extended the advantage to its largest the rest of the trip to the eighth pole, saw the runner up cut into
the deficit belatedly, remained in control and in front. CALL ON MISCHIEF cut over to the inside after making some light contact with MARYANORIGINGER
right after the start, tracked the winner until the end of the bend, was under a drive cutting the corner into the stretch, was quickly worked into the three path,
gained late. GYPSY JANIE sluggish on the backstretch, brought up the back of the pack two wide on the bend, fanned out into path six from upper to
midstretch, got up the show. MARYANORGINGER off the inside, pursued the pace three then four wide on the turn, was more the latter during the stretch
run, lacked the necessary response. OUR CIRCLE OF LOVE stalked the pace from path two in between rivals until the five-sixteenths pole, ventured out
four wide heading home, gave way. GONE GLIMMERING away last after losing her footing springing from the gate, departed the backstretch from the three
path, commenced the stretch one path wider, backed away. All riders carried an additional two pounds in accordance with a weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
SISTER ALEXA chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong, was under a near sided stick nearing the sixteenth marker latching on the runner up deploying an off
sided stick and had the whip batted from the rider's grip at that station, took over command inside that station and inched away to the finish to prevail.
LOVELY LADY LEXI six paths off the inside down the backstretch near the rear of the field, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing nearing
the quarter pole, swung five wide at that station, took over command straightened away, dug in under threat, got collared just after inadvertently batting his
main danger's whip from the rider's hand inside the sixteenth pole and was along clear of the rest and second best. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY chased three
then two wide coming under coaxing when taking command at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, got displaced from the front
straightened away and weakened in the late stages while along clear for the show honors. BEYOND DISCREET four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened.
CINDERVELLA bobbled at the break, raced forwardly placed five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, went six
wide into upper stretch and weakened. DUBLINORNOTHIN showed the way in hand from the two path under pressure, tucked inside at the half mile pole,
came under coaxing and was displaced from command five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE at a considerable distance from off the rail, pursued the pace four wide on the turn, swung about wide for the stretch run, gained
ground from upper to midlane, struck the front for good a short distance from the sixteenth pole, then barely hold off the second place finisher. SCARF IT
DOWN contently watched the front runners three wide for nearly three-quarters, fanned out into path seven from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest
of all, gained well, missed. PLAYWRIGHT cut over to the inside with the advantage, showed the way, feeling some pressure from the outside, came under
encouragement springing from the five-sixteenths pole as HERO'S HOPE increased its presence, surrendered for good a little shy of the sixteenth marker,
weakened into the show slot. AUTOSTRADE hung out five wide on the turn, was in path six by midstretch, stayed. HERO'S HOPE steadily advanced into
contention on the backstretch, departed it towards the two path, moved up issue a bid as the third fraction was being finalized, kept up its quest in earnest
until the eighth pole before weakening. OTHER THINGS EQUAL took up the chase four wide after stumbling at the start, commenced the stretch one wider,
made no impact. FRANKIE BARONE kept an eye on the pace from just off the rail, went four wide into the lane, lacked a response. REAL DAN pulled off
another after coming out slightly as the field was sent off and running, underwent a two to three wide journey, spun into the stretch and gave way. MILLS
saved ground for nearly three-quarters, tipped out two wide for the drive, had no offering. BOZZINI took the inside route, was under a ride after going a half,
folded. SUCCESSFUL SAINT forwardly placed two wide early, gave out. All riders carried an additional two pounds in accordance with a weather-related
safety initiative.

Footnotes
I'M FINE got squeezed between foes and was forced to steady as BELLA DOMENICA shut down her lane after the start, chased three to four paths off the
inside down the backstretch, got floated out five to six wide midway on the turn as STEPPIN' HAWK took the scenic route to her inside, angled in a path to
swing four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied angling to be just off the inside near the eighth pole, took over command a sixteenth from home and edged
clear to the finish to prevail. MUNNINGS MUSE prompted the pace from the two path coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive dueling with BEAUTIFUL KAREN to her inside through the stretch, got collared in tandem by the eventual winner and
kept on to prevail in the battle for the place honors. BEAUTIFUL KAREN showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under threat dueling through the stretch and was caught in concert with her main rival a sixteenth out, then
kept on but was just bested for the place honors. EQUANT four then three wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MASTEROF THE TUNES chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled
six wide into upper stretch and weakened. MOON SWEEPER broke in at the start, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off
the inside for home and tired. CALIDAD broke out at the start and was corrected, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three
wide for home and tired. STEPPIN' HAWK chased inside early on before tipping out two to three wide, angled out into the turn and floated out five wide
through that bend carrying I'M FINE to her outside out with her part of the way, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. BELLA DOMENICA squeezed
back I'M FINE after the start when tucking over, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
PINKY DUDE along the outside, sat reserved three wide during the run around the bend, swung into action by swinging six wide into the stretch,
straightened away and kicked into his best at the three-sixteenths pole, rolled by soon afterwards and drew clear. COHIBA GHOST brushed from between
opponents at the start, took up the chase four to five wide on the turn, shifted out eight wide for clearance once into the stretch, rallied down the outside to
get up for the place. COOLBOY settled in midpack after the field had been sent off and running, tracked the pace from just off the rail, angled about four
wide into the lane, finished well enough to be along for the show. PRINCIPAL DANCER brushed at the start, was two wide entering the turn, and tipped out
three wide exiting it, flattened out. MR. FIDGET taken hold right after the start, was slow to settle after climbing a bit during the opening phases, was sighted
towards path two at the top of the turn, got moved out into path five for the drive, went on to mostly improve position. CHARGE AHEAD kept watch on the
front runners from midpack two to three wide, angled five wide turning into the stretch, lacked the needed response. I SAW IT ALL got quickly spotted along
the rail after making light contact with another in the shadow of the starting, rode it for nearly three-quarters, tipped into the two path for the start of the
stretch run, came up empty. OUR AMERICAN STAR two to three wide in pursuit of the pace, got sent out seven wide into the lane to no avail. MACHO BOY
forwardly placed three wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path father off the rail, gave way. SHANDIAN vied for the lead from along the inside
route, steadied while tiring racing through the furlong grounds. INK SPLOTZ pressed the issue from path two, came under the pressure as the pressure late
on the turn, got overhauled, then steadily backed away. PRICING EXERCISE at or near the inside for three-quarters, failed to contend. RIDOLFO two wide
travelling on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, tired. All riders carried an additional two pounds in accordance with a weather-related safety initiative.

Footnotes
NICKY THE VEST responded to some coaxing on the chute to rush to the front end, was then held in reserve contending for the top with BLURT to the
outside, edged away from the opponent during the late stages of the run around the bend, got asked for more in the general area of the three-sixteenths
marker, responded, emerging at the eighth pole leading by his largest margin, saw the runner up closing in willingly, but had plenty left to remain nicely in
the clear. FULL MOON FEVER strung out three to four wide, got cued up spinning into the lane, altered course twice to elude weakening rivals during the
stretch run, secured the place, displaying good energy. BREW PUB two wide and being hand urged on the backstretch, was along the inside route in pursuit
of the winner on the turn, spun into the lane and got outfinished. JUDGE BERN bumped from both sides in the shadow of the starting gate, was sighted two
wide on the turn, got set down in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, commenced the stretch slightly wider, made no headway. BLURT vied from outside
the winner for nearly three-quarters and gave way. POLLARD'S DAY travelled three to four wide on the turn, got sent out into path five for the stretch run,
made no impact. TANNERS NECK LANE bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide, folded. SKIPPINGANDAJUMPIN tucked along the inside route,
was still on it when asked for more a sixteenth shy of the end of the bend, tipped out two wide stepping into the lane, backed away. RUSE light bumped at
the start, stalked the pace towards the three path on the turn, fanned out seven wide from upper to midstretch, had no rally. TALES OF SARATOGA made
some contact with each of his next stall neighbors at the start, cut over to the inside, rode the rail to the end of the bend and faltered. CELTIC HEART off the
inside throughout, departed the backstretch from path four, got spotted in the fifth one for the drive, gave way. HOLD THE IRISH brought up the rear, went
about the turn about three wide, wandered towards path eight heading for the top of the lane, wound up trailing throughout. All riders carried an additional
two pounds in accordance with a weather-related safety initiative.
