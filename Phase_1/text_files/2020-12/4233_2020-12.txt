Footnotes
DA GOLD ROOM was away alertly and went straight to the lead, angled in some early, moved clear when HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT was taken back near
the five-eighths, controlled the action while inside through the turn, responded well when shaken up in upper stretch and drew off under a brisk hand ride to
prove much the best. DUBLIN YINZ MONEY was coaxed along in third position, came under stronger encouragement while three wide on the turn, spun
four wide into the stretch under the whip and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT showed speed on the
inside of the winner then was taken back off the pace at the five-eighths, moved out then tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the turn
and tired while clear for the show. GOOD RIDE COWBOY was urged along on the outside, went around the turn in the three path and failed to threaten.
RANGE OF MOTION was hustled from the start then urged along while climbing into the kickback on the backstretch, moved to the far outside around the
half-mile pole, rounded the turn in the five path and was no factor. MAGA COUNTRY stumbled at the start and was off slow, spotted the front several
lengths, angled out at the rear at the five-eighths then angled back in again, saved ground under urging on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
JIMMY TWO TIMES disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, shook clear when asked for his best in upper stretch and drew off
under steady urging. SWOT ANALYSIS broke a half-step slow, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, brushed with a foe
inside the three-sixteenths, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong, lugged in late and safely secured the place. CREOLE CHARLIE broke a
step slow, settled outside under some restraint, angled in leaving the backstretch, was let out in the two path on the turn, chased behind the winner in upper
stretch, brushed with a foe inside the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. PERFECT PERIGEE broke in but was
away fast, contested the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.
BUNKIE'S SONG came inward at the start, was urged along at the rear, rounded the turn in the two path, lugged in briefly under a left-handed whip around
the furlong marker and was no factor. GUICE raced just off the pace while inside of a foe, chased in the three path while still inside that foe on the turn and
came up empty.

Footnotes
PHILLY WINS was hustled from the start, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear while roused into upper
stretch, extended the advantage under the whip into the final furlong, drew off under a drive into the final forty yards then was eased up in the final strides
while much the best. PLATINUM QUEEN was urged along off the pace, went five wide on the turn then was driven six wide into the stretch, drifted out some
near the three-sixteenths and earned the place while no match for the winner. STEPH'S SPIRIT chased the pace down the backstretch, drafted in the two
path for most of the turn then dropped the inside, was roused at the quarter-pole, chased under a drive in upper stretch and narrowly earned the show.
THETRUTHISTHETRUTH moved out early then was ridden along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response then just missed the trifecta. SHO NUFF chased the pace on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn, gained to make a
bid near the five-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner under a drive into upper stretch and tired. SPEEDY DUDETTE broke out at the start and was off near
the rear, raced on the outside towards the back under urging, lugged out eight wide into the turn, dropped to the five path before the three-eighths, came six
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. OPPS MY BAD broke a bit awkwardly and was last to commence, settled towards the rear, raced inside early on
the turn then moved to the two path, shifted four wide into the stretch, drifted about outside the furlong marker and came up empty. MERCEDES LADIES
was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond. SMITTYS
BARRACUDA was fractious in the gate but came away in good order, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, dropped
back into the stretch and faded.

FREE stalked the pace on the outside, engaged the leading duo in the four path on the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch, shook clear into the
final furlong and proved best under strong urging. AMERICAN LEGEND broke out and bumped with a foe, angled in while off the pace then was urged
along, went three then four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and finished willingly to just get the place. GIANNA'S GIFT broke very fast,
set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path while inside of two foes on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, bumped with an
opponent inside the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and was outfinished then narrowly lost the place but just held the show. BLACK
KAT TAPS hesitated at the start and was last to commence, chased the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, dropped in under
a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. LADY ANNA broke out at the start, pressed the pace on the outside of the
leader, vied in the three path while between horses on the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch, bumped with a foe inside the three-sixteenths,
dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. TIZ SUSAN ANN bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along at the rear, went four
then three wide on the turn and failed to respond.

dropped in behind the leading duo in upper stretch, made a bid inside those foes into the final furlong, gained the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then drew
clear under steady urging. JUSTINTHENICKOTIME went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch,
vied in the four path on the far turn, was carried six wide into the stretch then gained a short lead, battled outside of SPYCRAFT into the final furlong, got the
best of that foe into the final sixteenth but was outfinished by the winner while able to get the place. SPYCRAFT went to the front, rounded the first turn in
the two path, set the clear pace, was challenged leaving the backstretch, vied inside of a foe while in the three path on the far turn, floated five wide into the
stretch, battled inside of the runner-up into the final furlong then fought with two foes into the final sixteenth and weakened but was well clear for the show.

far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. PERFECT SENSE brushed with a foe after the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled
on the outside, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and came up empty. HE'S A LUCKY MAN was sent hard from the start, raced in the two path
on the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, came off the rail at the quarter-pole and failed to
respond. CHOPPA STYLE brushed with a rival after the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along passing the half-mile
pole, raced five wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. MATHESON went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear,

away, settled in third position, was roused four wide on the turn, floated five wide while gaining into the stretch then took the advantage, drifted in while
kicking clear inside the three-sixteenths, remained clear to the sixteenth-pole, swapped back to her inside lead at that point then shortened stride and was
overtaken but just held the place. MIA O MAYA was coaxed along off the pace, dropped back with a half-mile to run, raced inside early on the turn then

Footnotes
BARISTA bobbled at the start, raced in the two path early on the first turn then dropped to the rail, was reserved at the back, saved ground while moving
closer on the far turn, was given her cue near the five-sixteenths, cut the corner through a large opening into the stretch, rallied along the rail to make a bid
outside the sixteenth-pole, battled head to head with the runner-up to the wire and got her nose down to prevail in a head-bobbing finish. SYLVIA Q went to
the front, raced in the two to three path on the first turn, was well rated while setting the pace, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, floated four wide into the stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong, fought on when challenged by the winner outside the sixteenth-pole,
was guided in closer to that foe by the rider in the final sixteenth, fought on even terms to the wire and was out-nodded while clear for the place. ARM
CANDY went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, advanced four wide on the far turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, was carried five wide
into the stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. SUITE MADAM BLUE was hustled from the start
then taken in hand early, went three to four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, chased into
upper and came up empty. JOQULAR was fractious in the gate then broke a step slow, raced inside early on the first turn then moved to the two path, was
rated off the pace then let out around the five-eighths, dropped back midway down the backstretch, moved out around the half-mile pole, went five wide on
the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
SOUL STREIT showed good speed and set the clear pace, controlled the action while inside to the two path on the turn, extended the advantage when set
down in upper stretch, remained clear into the final sixteenth and held under steady urging. DEAN MARTINI was urged along off the pace, saved ground on
the turn, moved off the rail under a drive in upper stretch, angled out into the final furlong and closed determinedly but was too late while clear for the place.
TRINGALE was away alertly, chased the pace from second, went two to three wide on the turn and weakened but was clear for the show. OMEGA MOON
settled towards the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. LITTLE KANSAS was off slow and spotted
the front a few lengths, went three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. RED HOT DEVIL settled on the outside, was
urged three to four wide on the turn, dropped back under the whip in upper stretch and came up empty.
