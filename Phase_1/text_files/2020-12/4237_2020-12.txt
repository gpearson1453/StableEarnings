crossed over to the lead, cleared in the stretch but run down late. ARTEMU while clearly second best. ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS dueled to the turn but leveled
off in the stretch run. CERNAN rail trip to the turn with no late gain in the final furlong. CHASIN CHARLIE off slow while inside to turn, came widest past
quarter pole and improved late STRIKE APPEAL close up to the turn but gave way readily from that point. DARK OAK was pinched back at the start, raced
evenly to the stretch and faded in the drive. IL PRIMO SOLE (GB) was through after the half. HEAD ON VIDEO NOT PROVIDED TO EQUIBASE.

SET PIECE (GB) was bothered at the start, angled to rail steady run, five wide run past quarter pole and went clear while ridden out as much the best.
SIGNALMAN unhurried early, steady advance four wide with a late bid while no match for the winner in a good effort. VISITANT good position never far
back to far turn, bid stretch but faltered late while holding the show spot. RITZY A. P. no speed, split horses quarter pole and improved position from outside
in the stretch run. DABO raced evenly from inside but lacked a late response in the drive. HEMP HEMP HURRAY never untracked throughout while racing
back. SKYWIRE raced close up to the half but clould not go on and faded. BIG AGENDA chased leader to far turn but faded in the stretch run. SANDINO
RULER (ARG) good speed to quarter pole and gave way readily. MARZO stayed close to quarter pole, gave way from that point. SIBERIAN IRIS (IRE) was
never a factor with a wide trip. HEAD ON VIDEO NOT PROVIDED TO EQUIBASE.
