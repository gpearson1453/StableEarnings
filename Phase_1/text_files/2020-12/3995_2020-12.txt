Footnotes
DYN O MITE went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, responded well when asked under heavy threat at the quarter-pole, was
headed into upper stretch, dueled determinedly with the runner-up while rubbing saddles with that foe in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under
strong urging. T D DANCE broke a bit awkwardly, exchanged bumps with INDY TOURIST early then was taken up significantly between horses, moved
from the two path to the four path on the first turn, pulled hard on the bit under stout restraint onto the backstretch, dropped back near the three-quarter pole,
was rated under a snug hold, started the far turn in the two path, shifted four wide while roused at the quarter-pole, rallied outside to take a short lead into
upper stretch, dueled with the winner in the final furlong and just missed while clear for the place. INDY TOURIST exchanged bumps with T D DANCE early
then crowded between horses, went two to three wide under restraint on the first turn, settled more kindly on the backstretch, was asked while inside to the
two path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and weakened but just held the show. SPYGLASS came in and put rivals in tight early, went three to four
wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths, turned into the
stretch under a drive, dropped back between horses inside the furlong marker and tired. JOHNY'S FIREBALL bobbled awkwardly at the start, moved from
three to five wide on the first turn, tugged hard at the bit under restraint leaving the backstretch, settled outside with five furlongs to run, chased three wide
on the far turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
CATCAKE was well placed just off the pace, brushed with a foe around the nine-sixteenths, started the turn in the two path then shifted four wide at the
three-eighths, advanced to take the lead while dropping to the three path into the stretch, kicked clear under a drive in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths,
remained clear into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. HEY GRACE was hustled from the start, raced just off the pace, dropped back leaving
the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, gained passing the five-sixteenths, shifted to the two path and bumped with a foe at the quarter-pole, moved
further out at the three-sixteenths, chased the winner in the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. NINE LINE BIND settled towards the rear of the
field, went around the turn inside to the two path, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and improved position to just get the show. ZYDECO MUSIC
bumped with a rival early, settled towards the rear while inside of a foe, went four then five wide on the turn, was roused while six wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response then just missed the show. FOURSWEETNIECES broke a touch awkwardly, brushed with a rival early, settled off the pace,
brushed with a foe around the nine-sixteenths, was urged three to four wide on the turn and came up empty. SISTER CHLOE pressed the pace on the
outside, vied in the three path on the turn, was bumped while dropping back a bit into the stretch then steadied and had nothing left. LUCKY ARTIE set the
pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole and stopped. BLUE RIDGE HEAT bumped with a rival at
the start and was off a step slow, chased the pace on the outside then four wide early on the turn, lugged out six wide nearing the five-sixteenths, lugged out
badly to around the fifteen path in upper stretch and faltered. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA bumped with a rival at the start, bumped with another foe early, raced
well back on the outside, went six wide on the turn and also faltered.

Footnotes
APPLE DAPPLE was a bit eager under restraint in the two path early on the first turn, settled at the rear on the backstretch, started the far turn in the two
path, shifted four wide around the five-sixteenths, rallied outside into the stretch, made a bid at the three-sixteenths, battled outside of STROLLIN THE
BAYOU into the final furlong then edged clear under strong urging. SEBS PRINCESS broke in the air and was off slow, went three wide on the first turn,
settled off the pace, was roused while three wide on the far turn, chased into upper stretch, drifted out between the eighth-pole and the sixteenth-pole then
got up for the place. STROLLIN THE BAYOU went around the first turn in the three path, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far
turn, took the lead at the three-eighths then moved clear at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, led under the whip into the final
furlong and weakened. MARRAZANO went to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, set the pace with company to her outside, lost
the lead with three furlongs to run and stopped then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
FIRST CONTACT showed early speed, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths then moved out, went three to four wide on the turn, gained under a drive
into upper stretch, closed well to get the lead into the final furlong then edged clear under steady urging. HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT was coaxed along in
second position, went two to three wide on the turn, gained four wide into upper stretch, made a bid into the final furlong, lost touch with the winner into the
final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the place. DA GOLD ROOM settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the
two path, gained under a drive into the final furlong, held a good striking position at that point but flattened out and lacked the needed response while able to
get the show. CHASING ANNA was hustled from the start, angled in while opening up a sizable advantage, raced inside on the turn, came under the whip in
upper stretch, lost the lead into the final furlong and tired. TAINO HOUSE moved out then settled on the outside, was urged along while four to five wide on
the turn, raced on his inside lead in the stretch and came up empty. MY SUGAR TOWN broke out and a half-step slow, lagged well behind, dropped from
the two path to the rail on the turn and failed to threaten. RONNIE'S REASONING was forced out at the start and off a bit slow, dropped to the rail near the
half-mile pole, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path and was no factor.

Footnotes
CARAMEL LATTE bumped with a rival at the start, was hustled to the lead, contested the pace on the outside of a foe, vied in the two path while inside an
opponent early on the turn, dropped closer to the rail late on that bend, kicked clear when set down in upper stretch, remained clear under the whip into the
final sixteenth and was fully extended to last under strong urging. SPEAK TO ME was reluctant to load, bumped soundly with a rival at the start and was
taken up some, moved up to establish a good position just off the pace, was shuffled back behind SHANGHI DAISY leaving the backstretch, moved from
the rail to the two path shortly thereafter, shifted four wide around the five-sixteenths, dropped to three wide into the stretch, rallied into the final furlong and
closed strongly to just miss while narrowly able to get the place. DARLING JOANNA broke out then bumped with foes on both sides, settled just off the
pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and
closed well to just miss in a three-way photo but was well clear for the show. MY GIRL SWEET broke in and was off a step slow, moved up on the outside
then stalked the pace, made a bid in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. EXPLOSIVELY HOT showed some
early speed then dropped back, went four to five wide on the turn, gained passing the five-sixteenths, chased into the stretch and came up empty.
SHANGHI DAISY showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to her outside, dropped back at the seven-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn and
capitulated. MAGIC COY was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, settled on the outside, went five wide while roused on the turn, came six wide
into the stretch and failed to respond. FROIDEUR dropped back while ridden along, went around the turn in the two path and showed little.

five-sixteenths, came under the whip in upper stretch, drifted out under a left-handed whip passing the eighth-pole, responded well in the final furlong and
prevailed under steady urging. MAGIC VOW was well placed on the inside, moved off the rail early on the far turn, shifted three then four wide after being
roused around the five-sixteenths, rallied five wide into the stretch, gained to make a bid into the final furlong, battled with the winner into the final sixteenth
and missed while just able to get the place. BINDING tossed his head some when taken in hand early, went around the first turn in the two path, settled well
off the pace, was urged along while inside on the far turn, came out under a drive into upper stretch, moved in outside the sixteenth-pole and finished
willingly to just miss the place while narrowly able to get the show. SOCIAL MISFIT went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along
while moving from four to six wide on the far turn, gained into upper stretch, made a bid into the final furlong, battled into the final sixteenth and was
outfinished. LOOKING FOR BULL went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, raced three wide on the far turn, was asked at the
five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the whip, made a bid around the three-sixteenths, battled with multiple foes into the final furlong, dropped back
into the final sixteenth and weakened. BIG GIG went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear on the outside, was urged along while five wide
early on the far turn then dropped to the two path and lacked the needed response. CONFEDERATE YELL went three wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, was asked while four then five wide on the far turn and failed to respond. TWO DATE went five wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside,
made a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the two path on the far turn, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths and faded. HANSEN'S HOLIDAY steadied
against the rail nearing the first turn, saved ground on that bend, lagged at the rear, went three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and was
