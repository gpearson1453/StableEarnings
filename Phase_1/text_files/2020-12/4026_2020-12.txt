Footnotes
CLUB CAL stalked three deep up the backstretch, moved four wide into the stretch, collared rival inside the quarter pole, kicked clear and drew away.
LEMON DROP SHOT pressed the pace from outside, shifted in and bumped rival early on the backstretch, vied between around the far turn, took a short
lead into the stretch, could not match strides with the winner but was clearly second best. EQUIVOCATOR chased inside, dropped back past the halfway
point, traveled three wide into the lane, then came back on mildly to pass tired rivals for the show. BROKEN FINGER went three wide around the first turn,
tugged his way to the front outside the top pair, dropped back into a stalking position, challenged three deep again around the far turn and into the stretch,
then weakened in the lane. HE BE DANGEROUS sped to the front and crossed over to the inside, set the pace under pressure, bumped early on the
backstretch, vied with a pair of rivals around the far turn and into the lane, then gave way. CRASH CORRIGAN off slow to begin, pulled early, went between
rivals on the backstretch, chased two wide leaving the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
CA DREAMER drifted inward in the early stages, chased inside the leader then angled to the outside, bid alongside rival and dueled around the turn,
cleared foe in upper stretch and remained strong to the wire under right-handed urging. PURDUE away quickly from inside, set the pace off the inside then
angled inward, met the challenge from CA DREAMER and dueled from inside through the turn, lost contact with that rival in upper stretch but stayed on and
held the place. JUST GRACE chased the speed early, saved ground from inside, came out in upper stretch and missed the place. JENPIRESTRIKESBACK
trailed the field early, entered the turn two wide then exited a bit off the rail, finished willingly and passed tired rivals. COALINGA HILLS tracked outside a
pair, went five wide into the turn then angled into the four path and lacked a rally. C C THE BARTENDER tracked outside a rival, took the turn four then
three wide and weakened. TAKES A VILLAGE stalked off the inside, traveled three then two wide around the turn and also weakened.

PAINT ME AGAIN sped clear while rider was trying to ration the early speed, led two wide then three wide into the stretch and remained clear to the wire.
ATLANTIC STRIKE broke out and bumped rival, chased three deep early, three to four wide around the turn and whittled the gap on the winner in the final
sixteenth. AS REQUIRED traveled mid-pack early while off the inside, took the turn four wide then moved five wide entering the stretch, closed furlong
grounds but flattened out a bit late but got up for the show. DARING CAT chased the pace from inside and went evenly through the final furlong. TEQUILA
DIVA bumped leaving the gate, shuffled back early, traveled three wide on the turn then got floated out five wide by inner rival, drifted in a bit in upper
stretch and kept on through the late stages. WINTER STAR raced two wide into the turn then went between rivals around the bend, angled out leaving the
turn and failed to find more in the final furlong. TAKE HER TEMP tracked off the rail, went four wide into the turn, floated six wide by rivals entering the
stretch and proved no menace. BEST LADY saved ground around the turn, tipped out into the lane, lacked room upper stretch, moved out and could not
rally. PINK PHLOX bumped both sides at the start then steadied briefly early, settled off the pace, two wide around the turn, shifted in upper stretch and
weakened. CLARE'S IRISH EYES chased between rivals, dropped back on the turn and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
MEADWAY bumped leaving the gate, unhurried in the beginning, went three to four wide around the first turn, closed in around the far turn and entered the
stretch five wide, reeled in the leader in the final furlong and edged away late. TWIRLING DERBY broke out and bumped rival at the start, entered the first
turn six wide then angled into the four path, stayed off the rail up the backstretch, bid four deep around the far turn, took command past the three-eighths
pole, cleared into the stretch, caught in the final sixteenth and took an awkward step late while proving second best. FORT DODGE tracked two wide early,
off the rail on the backstretch, four wide into the lane, came out upper stretch and bested the rest. CLASSIC PRESENCE went four then two wide around
the first turn, chased off the rail, challenged between rivals around the far turn and into the stretch but proved no match in the late stages while keeping on
for a minor award. AFLEETING LIFE tucked inside on the first turn, saved ground to the stretch, lacked room in upper stretch, angled out then back inside
and improved position. FLOYD MONEYMAKER sped to the front and took control early, led up the backstretch then vied for command around the far turn
from inside and weakened in the lane. BARHOPSKY traveled four then three wide around the first turn, angled in on the backstretch, chased two wide into
the lane and never rallied. GAMBINI angled in on the first turn, went five wide into the stretch and was never a factor. MAGICAL ILLUSION went five wide
into the first turn then angled into the three path, chased outside a rival then vied three deep around the far turn, chased into the lane and weakened. HERE
I GO INDY traveled five then three wide around the clubhouse turn, trailed the field through the early stages, went two wide into the lane and never got
involved.

Footnotes
PROUD EMMA settled off the pace, loomed four wide into the stretch, rallied outside the leader, drifted in and brushed MESSAGE near the eighth pole,
then dug in late to edge the runner-up. MESSAGE forwardly place off the inside, bid outside the leader approaching the three-eighths, took over in upper
stretch, brushed by PROUD EMMA at the eighth pole, fought back from inside but could not hold off the winner. STELLAR SOUND came away last at the
start, went four wide around the first turn then surged to the front into the backstretch, cleared inside rival and showed the way to the far turn, challenged
near the three-eighths pole, fought back into the lane and weakened to third. MISS STORMY D showed early speed along the inside, was overtaken early
on the backstretch then chased the speed from inside, saved ground and cut the corner into the stretch, moved out at the eighth pole and weakened. BLUE
DIVA traveled a bit off the rail early, went outside a rival on the far turn, angled out into the stretch and lacked a rally. DONUT GIRL tucked inside on the first
turn, remained inside into the second bend then moved out into the two path into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN SCOTTY sped clear from the far outside, angled into the two path, led three wide into the lane, responded when challenged in upper stretch and
held gamely to the wire. THANKS MR. EIDSON stalked three deep, bid outside the leader in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick to get by.
LINCOLN CITY sat off the pace early, angled out on the turn, split foes late and got up for the show. FANTASTIC DAY trailed the field early, went two wide
into the turn, angled six wide leaving the turn and was edged for the show. JAMMING EDDY away quickly, chased the lone speed from between foes, exited
the bend two wide, drifted out in the stretch and finished evenly. SIGALERT went three to four wide around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and could
not rally. PASSIONATE REWARD tracked well off the rail early between a pair of foes, angled inward then came three wide into the stretch and failed to
response when called upon. HOLLYWOOD HEAT chased from inside, dropped back into the turn, saved ground into the stretch, tipped out and was never a
factor. TILTED TOWERS chased widest early while outside a pair of rivals, went four wide into the lane and weakened. DARNQUICK chased the speed
from inside, lost ground around the turn, cut the corner into the stretch and weakened.

the inside, spun four wide off the turn and finished willingly. SECRET SQUARE traveled off the pace up the backstretch, angled five wide into the turn and
showed a mild response to improve position while outfinished for a minor award. DON'T STOP LOOKIN dropped back early, went two wide into the lane,
moved out in the stretch and improved position. QUEEN OF THE TRACK stumbled leaving the gate, recovered quickly to show early speed, chased from
inside then a bit off the rail into the stretch, moved out in the lane and weakened. OLE SILVER bumped with inside rival at the start, traveled near the back
of the pack, angled six wide into the stretch and had little left. SUGAR PICKEL raced off the rail, three wide into the turn, angled out upper stretch and made
