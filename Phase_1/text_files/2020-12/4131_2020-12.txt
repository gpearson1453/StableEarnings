GINORMOUS never far back while four wide turn, angled to rail past the three sixteenth pole with a late rush to get up in time. TRIP THE QUEEN broke
slow, raced back to the turn, four wide late run for place. PARKING TICKET had an awkward start, trailed to the quarter pole with a widest late run for the
show spot. TIZ RED WINE sharp to the lead, stayed well to deep stretch and stayed determined late. HOLLY GO LIGHTLY never far back, rallied with a
three wide bid but outfinished through the final sixteenth. LITTLE SKIFF inside trip under heavy pressure to the turn with no late response in the stretch run.
SUMMER'S INDY tracked from outside to the turn but surrendered and dropped back readily. HEAD ON VIDEO NOT PROVIDED TO EQUIBASE.

QUEEN BRIDGET no speed from gate rated back to turn, circled field past quarter pole with a strong burst to be along in time on the wire. RICHIES NOBLE
GIRL unhurried to the turn, angled out for the place spot in a blanket finish. MADAME OVERSERVED speed from between horses to deep stretch but
outfinished late. LA CROIX VALMER battled along with the pace throughout but wore down in a blanket finish at wire. DIVINE QUALITY well off rail while
close up throughout and leveled off late. WELL SPENT never far back throughout and weakened in the stretch run. SHADILEE raced evenly with no late
kick when needed. ENVIED never far back to turn, got thru inside with a bid but faltered in the stretch run. SUPER PATRIOTIC never a real factor. HEAD
