Footnotes
MACH TRIAL racing in the four path while just off the pace, came in slightly at the head of the stretch and bumped with OFF DUTY, took the lead near mid
stretch and drew off. THOUSAND PERCENT came out and then steadied after the start, saved ground, drifted out out a bit entering the lane and was
bumped by OFF DUTY then was no match. OFF DUTY, four wide early, moved in a bit while drawing clear on the turn, drifted out contributing to the
bumping with MACH TRIAL then bumped THOUSAND PERCENT then dropped back. INKY DINKY DO raced three wide while dueling for the lead then
faded. JAMMIN JIMTOWN raced very wide, no factor. IRONBOUND between rivals and just off the pace, tired. The stewards posted the inquiry sign and
the rider of OFF DUTY lodged a claim against MACH TRIAL for interference entering the stretch but the result was unchanged.

Footnotes
LOUIE'S WISH, in the four path, went after leader on his own, took over near stretch, drifted out and drew off. KNOKKE BY THE SEA saved ground to
stretch, split foes and gained place. MAMAIGOTTHIS saved ground while outrun, rallied too late. BIG BAD BUD, well off the rail, drifted wider and tired.
SURFER BOY GEORGE was wide and failed to menace. DIZZY SIGHT set the pace in the three path, lost the lead near stretch then tired. REDNECK
COWBOY was never a factor.

SENSATIONAL ZIP ran freely in front, was never seriously challenged and won under mild handling. LUXURY SUITE, far back, split foes and gained place.
TOWN JAK raced two wide and tired. AHSAD saved ground early, drifted out and gave way. SPEED SYNDROME was never a factor.
BOBBYFROMTHEPALM, wide, failed to menace. KING'S GOLD chased from the four path then stopped.
