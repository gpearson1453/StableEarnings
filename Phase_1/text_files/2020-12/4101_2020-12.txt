DR. ANN squeezed through a small opening three wide rounding the first turn, dueled for the lead in that position, drifted out approaching stretch and then
was carried wider in early stretch, took the lead near furlong grounds, edged away a bit deep stretch and then held on. GALILEO'S AFFAIR, just off rail and
unhurried, continued inside rallying through stretch and was getting to winner. CAT GIUMARELLO came in leaving the gate, saved ground to final turn, split
foes into stretch and closed. LITTLEBITALILY saved ground disputing the pace, drifted out entering the stretch and weakened late. CHEVY TO THE LEVY,
in a bit tight rounding the first turn, vied two wide then tired. TOP HAT TIZZY raced wide and then drifted wider through stretch. HOLA PRINCESS broke
slowly then showed nothing. CHANCEE, four wide in top flight, stopped.

Footnotes
JENNA THE BOSS stumbled breaking sharply, dueled for command pace between foes, shook loose on the turn and held on under strong handling.
GABBY'SGOLDENVOICE broke slowly, saved ground early, split rivals through stretch and was getting to winner. SQUEALER broke slowly, saved ground
early, swung very wide in early stretch but was no real threat. INCANDESCENT saved ground in second flight and then tired. CLASSY ESCORT raced wide
and bid on the turn then flattened out. HOT NAIL, very wide, failed to menace. SWEET SAVAGE, between foes and just off pace, swung out entering the
stretch and tired. CAPE COD SALLY raced wide and failed to menace. PAMALWAYSGETSEVEN was never a factor. GAME ON GIRL was outside and just
off the pace, she lost action before leaving the backstretch, bolted and unseated her rider on the turn, continued on and ran into the outside fence and fell at
the top of the stretch.

out and split foes in the stretch and gained place. GOOD GOOD was outside winner early, looped the field on the turn and raced very wide into stretch and
through stretch. FRAN'S WORRIER set the pace between foes, edged clear mid stretch but then faded. E J'S REVENGE raced between rivals while well
placed then came up empty. TACTICAL PLAN raced wide while well placed, drifted wider leaving the turn and gave way. SPIN CYCLE split rivals on the
turn, was bumped by DENNIS' DIAMOND at the head of the stretch and was put in tight quarters. DENNIS' DIAMOND, three wide and just off the pace, was
