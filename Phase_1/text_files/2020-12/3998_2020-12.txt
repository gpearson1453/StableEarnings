TRIPLE DIGIT stalked the early pace, saved ground around the far turn, made a good rail bid and got up under strong encouragement. MIKEY'S JEWEL
was off a step slow, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. FLYIN IT was allowed to settle early, raced four wide into the
stretch, angled in late and had not enough. MAGIC ELECTION unseated her jockey behind the starting gate, ran off approximately one furlong prerace, was
quick to begin to set all the pace and weakened late while racing just off the inside. NICOLAR pressed the pace and gave way while racing in the four path.
PERFECTA STORM stalked the early pace, tired readily and was eased up on in the stretch.

Footnotes
PHANTOM RO pressed the early leader, gained command entering the far turn and held gamely in the drive under strong urging. ODDS ON stalked the
pace, moved up four wide into the lane and finished second best. NOVA BOY was slow in the early stages, raced along the inside around the far turn,
angled six wide through the stretch drive and gained ground willingly late. BALLIVOR was allowed to settle off the pace, raced five wide into the upper
stretch and never was a factor. BULL SHARK showed good speed along the inside and gave way. TALE OF E DUBAI stalked the pace while racing three
deep down the backstretch and failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
CREATIVE ALIBI tracked the leader while racing two wide, gained command into the lane and held gamely to the wire under steady handling. THE BOSS
OF YOU set all the pace along the inside and couldn't match strides with the winner through the drive to finish second best. EMBRACE A NEW DAY stalked
the pace, saved ground around the far turn, moved up four wide at the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. LADY MACHO was allowed to settle off the
early pace, raced in the six path through the drive and had no late bid. HAPPYCREST stalked the pace, raced five wide at the eighth pole and had no
response. CASSEY'S GIRL was unhurried early, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. WHY NOT YOU was slow early on, saved
ground around the far turn, experience traffic nearing the eighth pole, angled in and never was a serious threat. RED HOT KITTEN failed to sustain a bid.
