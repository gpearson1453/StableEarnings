wide into the stretch, angled out under a drive around the three-sixteenths then was carried further out, rallied outside while still on his inside lead in the final
furlong and closed well in the center of the track to get up late. AMAZING AMERICAN was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn,
gained into upper stretch, took the advantage into the final furlong, led under a drive into the final seventy yards but was caught while able to get the place.
GRAND LITTLE MAN was ridden along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, gained under the whip into the final furlong, moved out around the
sixteenth-pole and got up for the show. FIRST METAL COUNT chased the pace from third, went around the turn in the three path, gained to make a bid
under a drive outside the furlong marker, battled into the final sixteenth and was outfinished then lost the show. DOUG'S BUG raced off the pace under
urging, saved ground on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, drifted out significantly in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed
response. TOO MUCH BOURBON dropped well off the pace under urging, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. KING'S PRAYER

Footnotes
LADY OF LUXURY broke a half-step slow, moved up to stalk the pace on the outside of the leader, made an outside bid in the three path on the turn, took
the advantage in the five path into upper stretch, kicked clear outside the furlong marker, drew away under a drive while still on her inside lead into the final
sixteenth then was eased up late while much the best. NUN OF OURS was away alertly, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied inside of the
winner under urging in the two path on the turn, lost the lead in the three path into upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. SHE'S ALL
SKEET angled in while settling off the pace, saved ground on the turn, cut the corner in striking range into the stretch, dropped back under a drive into the
final furlong, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response while well clear for the show. RAGATAGTAG tracked the pace on the
outside, chased in the four path on the turn then came six wide into the stretch, dropped back while still on her inside lead into the final furlong and tired.
WEDDING DANCE broke a step slow, was coaxed along on the outside, came under stronger encouragement in the five path on the turn, floated seven
wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF THE LANE went straight to the front, contested the pace along the rail while inside of the runner-up, responded well when set down into upper
stretch then kicked clear, drew off under the whip until outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride to the wire while much the best.
CREATIVE LEGACY was away awkwardly then hustled, moved out behind the winner on the initial straightaway, contested the pace on the outside in the
two path, was asked near the five-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match while well clear for second.
ANNIE'S SHENANIGAN was off slow and spotted the front a couple lengths, dropped to the inside early on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged
along while inside to the two path on the far turn and came up empty. I GOT WINGS came outward early, went three wide on the first turn, was rated on the
outside, came under urging before the half-mile pole, dropped back three wide on the far turn and faltered.

NO EXAGGERATION was asked leaving the gate then taken up nearing the first turn, went four then three wide on that bend, settled off the pace, was
urged along while three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch under the whip, rallied outside while still on his inside lead into the final furlong
and closed well to get up late. MANGO TREE went three wide on the first turn, tracked the leading duo on the outside, went three wide on the far turn, was
given his cue outside the quarter-pole, took the lead in the four path into the stretch, drifted in outside the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth but was
caught while clear for the place. OXWOOD was reluctant to load but came away in front, angled in while moving clear early, rounded the first turn in the two
path, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, battled into the final sixteenth and
weakened while able to hold the show. CHARITY FOR ALL bumped with a rival at the start, went four then three wide on the first turn, contested the pace
on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, dropped back passing the three-sixteenths and tired. BOLD DELIVERY
was off slow and spotted the front a couple of lengths, raced inside on the first turn, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, rounded the far turn in the
two path, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ROLL TYLER saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while
inside on the far turn and came up empty. PRETTY CREATIVE hit the inside of the gate at the start, was off a bit slow then bumped solidly by a rival and
taken up while pushed over the heels of PRETTY CREATIVE, spotted the front around three lengths, went three wide on the turns and failed to respond.
PAPA MOLLY went five wide on the first turn, dropped back onto the backstretch, lagged at the rear, went two to three wide on the far turn and was no
factor.

Footnotes
CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT brushed with a foe at the start, saved ground while falling well behind the other two on the first turn, settled well behind those foes,
moved closer with a half-mile to run, rallied while shifting from the rail to three wide on the far turn, closed strongly to get the lead outside the quarter-pole,
moved clear in the four path into the stretch, drew away under one tap of a down-turned whip inside the three-sixteenths then widened under a mild hand
ride. POPULIST brushed with a rival at the start, went to the front, contested the pace in the two path, moved clear leaving the backstretch, was asked
under heavy threat from the winner coming to the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to that rival outside the quarter-pole and proved no match while well
clear for second. HIGH CRUISE went around the first turn in the five path, contested the pace on the outside, chased four then five wide on the far turn,
dropped back in the seven path into the stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
ADINA showed speed between horses and disputed the pace, vied in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, extended the advantage
into the final furlong and held under strong urging. GILDED APPLE showed early speed between horses then dropped back, shifted from the two path to the
four path nearing the three-eighths, dropped inward in upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. LIL BAD LIL
BOUJEE was taken up while in tight at the start, raced off the pace under urging, started the turn along the rail, shifted four wide before the five-sixteenths
then came five wide into the stretch and was best of the rest. MAGIC COY broke a half-step slow, chased the pace on the outside, went four then three wide
on the turn, made a bid in the process, spun five wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. DIVIDED broke through the front of the
gate then was brought back around and reloaded, was eased back between horses early then dropped back around the half-mile pole, went four wide on
the turn, came six wide into the stretch and capitulated. SHARP BUZZ showed speed on the inside of rivals while along the rail, dropped back coming to the
five-sixteenths, moved out in upper stretch and faded. MY GIRL EM broke in at the start, was urged along near the back on the outside, went six then five
wide on the turn, dropped to four wide under a strong drive approaching the quarter-pole and failed to threaten. HOLY WAR broke a step slow, was ridden
along towards the back, went five wide early on the turn, dropped to the three then two path later on that bend and failed to respond. HAUTE CUISINE
brushed the inside of the gate at the start, was urged at the back, went four to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor.
STANG'S GALAXY disputed the pace on the outside of rivals, dropped back between horses leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and
retreated.
