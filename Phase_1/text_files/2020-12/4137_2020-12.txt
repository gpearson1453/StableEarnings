Footnotes
SOCIAL CHIC stalked the early pace two deep then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled to the front past the quarter, drew clear
mid-stretch and drew away the final sixteenth. UNCLE FUNKY rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dug in
to the challenge of the winner from that point, gave up the edge into the far turn but remained a close factor through the upper stretch before giving way.
JUBA DID IT settled close inside the first turn, eased out with a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole and raced close three wide on the far turn, though,
flattened inside the sixteenth pole. JUST GETS BETTER rounded the first turn about the four path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and saved ground on
the far turn, to no avail. SPURN rounded the opening turn about the five path and showed little response from the three eighths pole.

Footnotes
CHUCK'S DREAM angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and put Viper away through the far turn, then
dug in under steady handling to hold on well. MERRY MERRY MOJO settled off the pace inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn
just off the rail, then dug in to take second later yards. VIPER stalked the winner two deep then picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, but
drifted toward the head of the lane and flattened out the final furlong. DOOLEY settled off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase from the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little more. DEPUTY DREW raced off the pace in the two and three paths and showed little
response through the backstretch. MARCH TO MY TUNE rounded the opening turn about the four path, settled off the pace into the front stretch and
showed little down the backstretch. NORTH DUBAI dropped well back early on.

Footnotes
MINISTRY OF MAGIC rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole and was kept alert to extend his lead down the lane.
STRIDE ON BY settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved to take second at the rail midway on the
far turn, but proved no match in the stretch. RETURN TO ME raced in the three and four paths the first turn then bid into the backstretch, raced in the four
and five paths on the far turn and was along to take third mid-stretch. JUBA EARLY rounded the opening turn in the six path and raced outside into the
backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, continued in the six path of the far turn and passed rivals in the stretch. TWENTYTWENTY
saved ground off the pace, gave chase toward the three eighths pole but flattened stride at the rail on the far turn. IN THE GOSPEL stalked the pace two
deep then challenged nearing the three eighths pole, but dropped back toward the quarter and weakened on the far turn. STRINGFELLA raced just off the
pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole but weakened off the rail rounding the far turn. EMPEROR PENGUIN raced off the pace and
off the rail and showed little response through the backstretch. ALLOVERBUTTHECRYIN was not a factor. JIMMYTHEPACO rounded the opening turn
about the seven path and never factored.

Footnotes
ZIRCON ZLOTY chased the pace and took the lead nearing the quarter pole, raced clear two deep midway on the turn and was steadily handled to hold on
well. UNKISS ME gave chase and raced three wide on the turn, took over second inside the eighth pole but couldn't gain in the stretch. MEEMAW'S HEART
was slow into stride but picked up the chase past the half mile pole, rounded the turn at the rail, angled five wide into the stretch and got up to take third later
yards, while gaining on second. LADY REBEL chased the pace inside, raced at the rail on the turn, came off the rail into the stretch and ran evenly to late
stretch before flattening stride. NO STONE UNTURNED chased the early pace inside, was roughed off the inside flank of Zircon Zloty nearing the five
sixteenths pole, quickly recovered stride and raced five wide on the turn, drifted into the stretch and showed little more. VIBRANT GINGER chased the pace
outside, rounded the turn about the six path, was carried wider into the stretch and showed little more. FLOWERS VALE surged clear and angled in to set
the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, was caught at the pole, dropped back at the rail midway on the turn and showed no further
response.

Footnotes
ASTRO RIDER stalked the pace two deep then challenged nearing the three eighths pole, contested the far turn at a close disadvantage while two deep,
dug in for the lead mid-stretch and inched clear approaching the wire. PROTA took over nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the
pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn but was caught mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded
the final yards. BYEBYE BYEBYE settled off the pace inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, but flattened stride
inside the sixteenth pole. WINNING SCHOLAR settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the
far turn in the three path, eased out into the lane but showed little more. SUNBRIDLED steadied lightly at the start and settled off the pace in the three path
the first turn, then showed little response past the three eighths pole. GATTOSING rated close inside then gave way nearing the five sixteenths pole.
EXPLOITATION settled off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn, eased out into the backstretch but showed little response. KOPP CAT raced in
the four path the opening turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FREEDOM IS RINGING stalked the early pace two deep, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced close in the two and three paths of
the turn, dug in for the lead later yards and was inching ahead approaching the wire. CASTLE FIVE rated the early pace inside, was pressured from the five
sixteenths pole and rounded the turn at the rail, gave up the lead in later yards and grudgingly yielded nearing the wire. YOU GO BOY steadied on the chute
and angled toward the outside to give chase, raced in the six path of the turn and finished well to take over third the final strides. RING THE BELLA chased
the pace outside, rounded the turn about the five path and was nipped from third the final strides. SEA LOVER chased the pace inside, rounded the turn at
the rail then flattened stride leaving the eighth pole. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND gave chase and raced three wide on the turn, then weakened. WE SHOULD
TALK chased the pace outside and rounded the turn about the six path. SHACKLED rated close to the early pace then faded off the rail on the turn.

Genesis G G then picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, steadied approaching the quarter pole, raced hemmed in toward the head of the lane but
dug in past the eighth pole and finished well. IRON HENRY steadied behind a narrowing opening in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, picked up the
chase at the rail past the quarter and rounded the turn at the rail, then angled out into the lane and passed a rival. OCHO set a pressured pace inside but
was caught at the rail approaching the quarter pole, dropped back into the stretch and flattened stride the final furlong. THREE PUNCH gave chase outside
and rounded the turn about the five path. MY FINAL NINJA broke awkwardly and hopped leaving the gate then raced in the six path of the turn. SPRING
