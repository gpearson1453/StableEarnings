BINGHAM'S FLASH raced in mid pack early, raced six wide into the turn, was closing, took control at the eighth pole and edged clear. FIGHT ME was
allowed to settle early, advanced along the inside, was no match and finished second best. LODESTONE set a pressured early pace from off the rail, drifted
out late and weakened. CHAMPION DEPUTY was void of any speed, saved ground throughout and offered a mild late rally. SQUALLSGHOSTMOVER was
squeezed at the start, was unhurried early, raced between rivals and never fired. ENGAGEMENT RING broke out at the start, was rushed into the turn,
angled out and faded. SASSY KITTY was not far back early, went five wide and tired. PAPER ROSES tracked the early pace, went six wide and was empty.

the second turn and never fired. DAWOOD was taken back, went five wide into the second turn and was finished early. INCLUDE HOO was void of any
speed and was never a factor. ENROUTE pressed the early pace from between rivals and faded.

Footnotes
ESTEEMED tracked the early pace, went five wide into the second turn, made a bid, dueled with METEORIC to late stretch and prevailed for the win.
METEORIC pressed the early pace from between rivals, met the bid of the winner, couldn't sustain and finished second best. GOLDEN MERGER was
outrun early, circled eight wide out of the second turn and offered a mild late rally. GO TOWER GO was void of any speed, raced six wide into the second
turn, drifted in and finished belatedly. TOSS THE FLAG was allowed to settle early, raced between rivals into the final turn and never fired. PAIN FOR GAIN
stalked the early pace from the inside, took a brief lead and weakened. ELUSIVE ACCOUNTING raced in mid pack early, advanced along the inside into the
home turn and gave way. FLY WITH PRIDE set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail and faded.

Footnotes
IMPEACHING pressed the early pace, went three wide into the turn, opened up and held. CEDE'S DREAM was allowed to settle early, raced along the
inside, angled out, was closing late and finished second best. OUR NATIVE ANGEL was up close early, went five wide and gave way. RUN'N DOWN A
DREAM was unhurried early, advanced between rivals and never fired. POLAR ROUTE tracked the early pace, went six wide into the turn and was empty
late. DIAMANTE APPEAL was taken back, angled in and passed tired rivals. SUCCESFUL SKY set a pressured early pace from the inside and weakened.
THOUGHT I'DMISSYOU was void of any early speed, circled nine wide and offered no rally. MOLLY DENALI raced in mid pack early, advanced seven wide
and flattened out. GRAMMYSPERFECTSTAR was outrun early, advanced eight wide and had no impact. HOT N PERTY was not far back early, raced
along the inside and faded.
