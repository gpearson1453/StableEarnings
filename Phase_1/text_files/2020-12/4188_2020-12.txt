TOMASCO dueled two wide, shook clear mid stretch then held on. NAUGHTY PRINCE saved ground, eased out through stretch and was gaining on his
stablemate. YOUR AWESOME BOSS, in the four path and just off pace, drifted out and had no rally. SARGEANT DRIVE broke slowly then saved ground
and wasn't a serious threat. G DADDY stalked along the rail, drifted out and tired. VENTUS was never a serious threat. DOUGIE broke slowly, saved
ground and was outrun. MAYNOOTH broke slow and was never a factor. INDIGO YANKEE raced wide and wasn't a factor. MY DANZIG PARTNER, two
wide and just off the pace, stopped.

Footnotes
POSSEINEFFECTTOO raced outside, moved wider into stretch, closed strongly and won going away. FOUR SEASONS GIRL, two wide early, swung very
wide into stretch and was up for place. JAFFLE set the pace in the three path, drifted out stretch and held on well. STAY SALTY got to the rail by the far
turn, was well placed but had no rally. MADELYN'S DANCER broke slowly, saved ground, steadied on the far turn and finished in a dead heat with TOO
MUCH DRAMA. TOO MUCH DRAMA, far back early, advanced along the rail and finished on even terms wtih MADELYN'S DANCER. COME AND GET IT
was two wide prompting the early pace then gave way. MRS. PHELPS, far off the rail and just off the pace, tired. I'AM A UNICORN had only brief speed.
JULIET'S MUSIC, three wide and just off the pace, also tired. BETTER BEGIN was never a factor. ROCKFORD GIRL saved ground and stopped.

the pace two wide, took over and was clear mid stretch but was outfinished. FLAT OUT FLASHY, in the three path, rallied between rivals in early stretch,
was eased back and tried to move outside but unable. DONNIE BRASCO saved ground early, moved out three wide on far turn, challenged then faded late.

FIRST CITIZEN set the pace well off the rail, drifted wider through stretch and edged away. SHOOGER RAY TOO, just off the rail, eased out in early stretch
then angled back to the rail and gained. MITHRA broke slowly, raced in the five path, offered a nice run on the final turn then flattened out. BABY BULL,
wide early, moved in then tired. HOLD MY CALL was three wide, challenged on the final turn then gave way. PERFECT DAYDREAM, between foes early,
was left with the rail and came up empty. MONGOLIAN HERO was never a threat. BARINGER SPRING, very wide early, showed little.
MAGICALLYDELICIOUS saved ground and stopped.
