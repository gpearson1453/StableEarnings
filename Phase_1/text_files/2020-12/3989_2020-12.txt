unhurried early then rallied on the far turn while five wide making a bid then flattened out in the drive. FAKE SOLUTION was unhurried early then made a
mild rally and was no threat. SMACK ATTACK stalked the pace while three wide on the backstretch, rallied on the far turn then flattened out in the drive.
