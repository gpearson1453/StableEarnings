Footnotes
TIGER ON YOUR SIX stalked contested pace off the rail in the two path, entered turn off the rail and loomed boldly midway through the turn splitting foes,
and came out at the eighth pole, put to a strong drive in the lane and drove past rivals in deep stretch. PAPA CABALLERO pressed contested pace three
deep in between rivals on the backstretch, entered turn three wide and late in the turn two wide, entered stretch in the lead and battled gamely in the stretch
and overtaken late by outside closing rival. EDDIE EAGLE pressed leaders in between rivals on the backstretch, entered turn three wide, went to rail late in
the turn, kept bidding for lead in stretch, no match for top two but well clear of nearest pursuer. BADGER pressed leader four deep on the backstretch,
lacked room entering the turn and steadied shortly thereafter, re-bid three wide on the turn and bested rest in the stretch. HOSS CARTWRIGHT led a
contested pace along the inside, entered turn in the lead along the rail, steadily faded through the turn and came up empty in the stretch. RUN HEAT
pressed leader in hotly contested pace five wide on the backstretch, entered turn four wide and steadily faded while never threatening thereafter.
