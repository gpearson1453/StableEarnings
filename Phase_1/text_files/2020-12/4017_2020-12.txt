Footnotes
FORMAL TREASURE, held up off the second flight between foes racing to the first turn, was taken up avoiding some traffic entering the backstretch while
shifting outwards into the path of MISSION BRIEF, was righted while angling to the inside racing into the far turn, steadily gained position splitting rivals just
off the inside racing through the stretch and rallied to the front in time under firm right handed pressure. UNIDENTIFIED MAN gained terms with the
pacesetter three deep racing to the first turn attending the pace, continued outside the leader through the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn to
go clear in late stages but couldn't fend off the winner. MISSION BRIEF tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the first turn, was carried out
entering the backstretch while steadying slightly, angled inwards racing into the far turn, then split foes just off the inside in the closing stages to prevail for a
share. SOULONG settled last racing to the backstretch, angled six wide entering upper stretch and made some belated progress. GRAY GILDING
exchanged bumps at the start, was reserved between foes to the backstretch, then continued evenly while shifting to the three path entering the lane.
DYNAMORE, urged between foes dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing into the first turn, angled to the inside nearing the backstretch, conceded the
lead while shifting off the inside racing through the backstretch and soon gave way. MAGIC SOLUTION, held up in close quarters along the inside tracking
just off the leaders to the first turn, was prompted to make a sharp advance to gain the advantage when presented an opening midway through the
backstretch, dueled for command on the far turn into the lane and gave out leaving the furlong marker. DELAWARE DESTROYER exchanged bumps with
GRAY GLIDING at the start, was caught four wide to the backstretch, and steadily faded in that path into the lane. MILITARY COMMANDER, bumped at the
start, was reserved between foes, then prompted in pursuit of the leaders into the backstretch but gave way early. BEDAZZLING, forwardly placed along the
rail prompting the pace to the first turn, switched out entering the backstretch and abruptly gave out. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF MISSION
BRIEF LODGED A CLAIM OF AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ON THE BACKSTRETCH WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
ARROGANT MAN, urged between foes from the outset disputing the pace, dueled outside a rival racing into the turn, then edged clear in the closing stages
under firm right handed pressure. BIZ NOW tracked just off the first flight along the rail racing into the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and continued
willingly between rivals to prevail for the place honors. BEACH BANDIT, a bit outpaced in early stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn, saved
ground to upper stretch and steadily improved position. GRAB THE CHANCE, forwardly placed three deep between foes in the opening stages, was eased
back racing into the turn and continued evenly between foes into the lane. HESALITTLE SHADY was urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace
racing into the turn, then gave way entering the stretch. TURPIAL, caught five wide between foes in the second flight racing through the backstretch, shifted
in on the turn to lodge a brief, three wide bid between foes nearing the lane but soon flattened out. DEVILISH TAIL flashed brief pace four wide between
foes racing through the backstretch but emptied out early. HERE FOR BEER settled between foes and failed to menace. IAMMAJESTICRED proved no
factor. UPRISE tracked just off the second flight between foes racing to the turn but offered no rally. DREAM OF ANFIELD, caught six wide racing through
the backstretch, made some brief progress four wide on the turn but soon gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
POPPY'S PRIDE sprinted clear along the inside soon after the break, set the pace on a comfortable margin racing into the turn, shifted out racing into upper
stretch while turning back a rival's challenge and went clear through the stretch under brisk handling. AL HEYBAY tracked off the second flight racing four
wide in early stages, angled inwards entering the turn, then split rivals entering the stretch to prevail for the place honors inside foes nearing the wire.
THEALLIGATORHUNTER broke sharply, tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight racing into the turn, then continued willingly outside
foes to prevail for a share nearing the wire. GATSBY, bumped at the start, was quickly righted, then urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the
turn, lodged a brief bid nearing upper stretch but flattened out in late stages. ARREST ME RED broke out bumping GATSBY lightly at the start, was
collected to track the pacesetter inside foes racing into the turn and faded along the rail in late stages. TAPSASIONAL was slow into stride, angled inwards
while racing under light reserve racing into the turn but had no further response.

Footnotes
BEAUTY GENIUS broke readily to gain the advantage, dictated the pace on a narrow margin nearest the inside to the backstretch, kicked clear racing into
upper stretch and was kept to firm encouragement. PRINCESS NINA tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening half, steadily advanced outside a
rival to challenge the leader nearing upper stretch but proved no match. BEAUTIFUL TIZ angled inwards racing through the chute to gain terms with the
leader attending the pace under light reserve, continued between foes into the backstretch, was prompted to press the issue nearing the far turn but
weakened while shifting to three path racing into the lane. DIXIELAND DARLING broke inwards brushing the gate, then was taken up out of tight quarters at
the start, settled last to the far turn, then steadily advanced racing five wide into the lane to gain position to the end. TAP SOLO tracked off the first flight
along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing through the lane but had no closing bid. MARLEE, held up avoiding close quarters in the
opening stages, pulled against firm restraint inside foes tracking off the second flight racing to the far turn but offered no closing bid. ALEX'S FIRST, urged
to a forward placing three wide racing to the backstretch, gave way early. REAWAKEN, caught in traffic while held up between foes in the last flight racing
through the chute, failed to menace thereafter. INDY FRONT exchanged bumps while racing through the chute, then was shuffled back early, settled
outside foes in the opening half and proved no threat. CHICHI RIVICHE exchanged bumps racing through the chute while being held up three deep to the
first turn, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
MELANCHOLY BLUES broke readily, was rated tracking off the first flight racing five wide through the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path
racing into the turn, shifted inwards moving to challenge the pacesetter nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage from that foe and went clear under
firm handling. LEGANT LAOBAN tracked the leaders from out of striking distance along the inside racing to the turn, steadily gained momentum splitting
foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to prove best of the others. CHERRY ROCK BRIDGE, caught in close quarters at the
start, settled last early, angled out six wide racing into the turn and continued willingly in that path to late stages gaining position to the end. AGELESS
ARTIST settled outside foes in the last flight early, was prompted to advance racing into the turn, angled inside nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed
final kick. THE LITTLE KITTY veered out sharply at the break, was righted, then urged to regain terms with the first flight racing seven wide through the
backstretch, advanced four wide on the turn to challenge for command, shifted inwards nearing upper stretch crossing rivals path and gave out once headed
by the winner. CHARLITA angled to the inside pursuing the first flight racing into the turn and came up empty entering the stretch. STEPPIN ON OUT vied
with the first flight five wide between foes racing through the backstretch but soon faded. LITTLE MISS HODOR settled between foes early and failed to
menace. REALLYGOODTIMES, restless while being saddled in the paddock, proved no threat. DREAMS STILL WILD, urged three wide between foes
pressing the pace through the backstretch, was taken up avoiding tight quarters leaving the midway point of the turn and quickly gave way. ELUSIVE EYES
shifted inwards pressing the pace between foes through the backstretch into the turn and was through after a half. MARIA'S MIRAGE angled to the rail in
the opening stages disputing the pace, pressed the issue into the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
DOMAIN EXPERTISE broke readily, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace into the first turn, gained a narrow advantage racing through the backstretch,
shook clear racing into upper stretch and was gathered up nearing the wire. REINA DEL SOL tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half,
angled out four wide racing through the stretch and proved best of the others. LISHEEN tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch,
continued under patient handling along the inside on the far turn, then angled five wide in the closing stages to edge rivals for a share. DOUBLE BLESSED
was rated off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. LADY BLAKENEY tracked just off the first flight along
the inside racing to the backstretch, gained position inside foes entering the lane but flattened out late. RIGHT ROUND settled outside foes in early stages,
made some brief progress between foes racing into upper stretch but had no late kick. MAKE A SCENE, urged between foes prompting the pace racing into
the first turn, pressed the issue outside the winner to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. ROSSENARRA joined the pace three wide early, pressed
the issue in that path to the far turn, then gave way into the lane. VOW SAVER off slowly, settled along the inside early and never menaced thereafter.
DANCIN AT THE RITZ settled between foes early and never mounted a serious challenge.

MI CLEOPATRA AND I was prompted to gain a forward placing tracking just off the first flight along the inside racing through the backstretch, shifted out
three deep nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to just edge the leaders in time under firm handling. R GOODTIME CHARLIE
broke out bumping at the start, was quickly righted, then urged between foes to gain terms with the first flight, pressed the issue between foes into the turn,
angled to the rail nearing upper stretch continuing grudgingly inside a rival to late stages and finished on even terms with that foe while failing to contain the
winner. PELUCHIN CHIN tracked off the first flight four wide in early stages, advanced racing into the turn to press the issue three deep, then outside a rival
into the lane and continued willingly contesting the issue to the end to share the place honors. EXIT RIGHT settled last racing to the turn, split foes, then
angled four wide racing into upper stretch but continued with an effort to improve position. OSPREY tracked off the second flight along the inside racing into
the turn and continued evenly. FREELANCE, restless in the gate, was urged between rivals prompting the pace in the opening stages but gave way early.
VALIANT THOR was hustled to the lead while angling to the inside, dueled for command into the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. MIDNIGHT
TRAVELER, bumped at the start, dropped out early.

Footnotes
NIGHT THINGS, in touch tracking just off pacesetter racing to the first turn, inherited the lead entering the backstretch, dictated the pace outside a rival on a
narrow margin to the far turn, then kicked away through the stretch under firm handling. HABITUS, bumped at the start, clipped heels racing through the
chute while angling to the inside, tracked off first flight inside foes, shifted out on the far turn to split foes three wide and continued willingly to close the gap.
BROTHER IN ARMS, reserved along the inside in the opening half, saved ground on the far turn, then shifted out to split foes just off the inside and
continued well enough to prevail for a share. KAYAKER settled between foes in the last flight early, was prompted to advance outside foes while being
fanned five wide into the stretch and continued with a mild bid. DYNABLUE tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, raced in close
quarters between foes through the far turn to upper stretch and had no rally. VAN settled last early, swung out six wide racing into upper stretch but made
no impact. FILIGREE tracked off the first flight three wide racing to the backstretch, was prompted to make brief progress four wide entering the far turn and
faded into the lane. COMPLY, forwardly placed along the rail tracking just off the pacesetter, continued inside foes to the second bend and gave way into
upper stretch. PLEASANT VALUE, urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, bore out entering the backstretch, was pulled up on
the far turn and walked off under his own power. PRIVATE CODE drifted out racing into the first turn, raced wide into the backstretch, was pulled up nearing
the far turn but walked off the course under his own power.

Footnotes
FEELING MISCHIEF was prompted to a forward placing while conceding the lead to a rival in the opening furlong, tracked just off that rival racing into the
turn, continued with a steady advance to bid for command racing into upper stretch, took over midstretch and went clear under firm handling. GULF COAST
reserved outside foes while caught five wide on the backstretch, was prompted to make a steady, four wide advance racing through the turn into the lane
and proved best of the others. LITTLE NESSO tracked off the first flight between foes, then along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out entering the lane
and continued willingly while no match for the top pair. BRIELLA was hustled clear of the field while angling sharply to the rail, set the pace on a clear
margin into the turn, briefly dueled inside the eventual winner in upper stretch but gave way leaving the furlong marker. BATTLE CRY tracked the leaders
four wide as part of the second flight and continued evenly three deep between foes on the turn, then into the lane. SPECIAL PRINCESS tracked off the
second flight along the inside racing into the turn and continued evenly inside foes into the stretch. WHOLEBODEMEISTER ducked at the start, was settled
between foes in the last flight, angled out racing into upper stretch but had no rally. YOU NEVER CALL broke awkwardly, was settled last near the inside
and never menaced thereafter. STRIKING CHROME retreated early. MOLLY'S ANGEL was settled between foes in early stages and offered no rally.
HARA, urged to gain a forward placing three deep tracking the pacesetter outside the eventual winner, shifted inwards racing into the turn and soon gave
way.

Footnotes
FROST POINT, off last, raced unhurried while shifting out on the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide into the turn, continued with a sustained
response shifting inwards racing into upper stretch and wrested a clear advantage late under firm left handed pressure. MOANAS POWER broke readily,
was urged prompting the pace outside a rival in the four path racing through the backstretch, shifted inwards entering the turn pressing the issue, gained a
narrow advantage midstretch but couldn't contain the winner. NORA RADD, urged from the break disputing the pace in the three path racing through the
backstretch, angled inwards dueling for command through the turn to upper stretch but gave out late. GRAPEVINE tracked off the second flight between
foes in early stages, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position. RANSOMS REWARD tracked off the
second flight inside foes, shifted out racing into upper stretch and finished evenly between foes late. SOUTH HOUSE was prompted to a forward placing
three wide early, tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing into the turn, angled in entering the stretch and steadily faded. BABY GUNDIN
settled between foes in early stages and never gained contention. MONEY AND HONEY angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing to the turn
and faded into upper stretch. SPARKLING PLENTY dropped out early. BLAZING ZENNA proved no factor. PRETTY PRINCESS made brief pursuit of the
leaders four wide through the backstretch and gave way racing into the turn.
