Footnotes
KOTTONCANDY KISSES grabbed the lead heading into the first turn, continued to set the pace near the inside down the backstretch, held firm over
pursers around the far turn, was shaken up at the top of the lane, responded willingly and widened to a commanding lead. MAUI JANE tracked up close
racing near the inside through early stages, hustled along the rail around the far turn, sustained a steady bid through the stretch run and held off foe to take
place. WILD PROSPECT was off a step slow at the start and raced in the back of the pack into the first turn, remained unhurried to the far turn then roused
for more turning for home, steadily gathered momentum along the outside and got up for a share. ORATORY GLORY settled nicely while positioned in
range of the early leaders, launched a three wide bid mid-way around the far turn, sustained bid into upper stretch then flattened out in the final furlong.
CLAY'S QUARTZ was forwardly placed around the first turn and continued up close just off the pacesetter to the far turn, launched a two wide bid and
hustled along into upper stretch then failed to keep pace past the furlong marker and gave way. MIGHTY HEIDI was unhurried through early stages, saved
ground around the far turn and lacked a needed rally in the lane. RIVER LIBERTY stalked in close contention down the backstretch then failed to advance
when called upon on the final turn.

CREDIT CARD FRAUD was away in good order then settled into tracking position through early stages, picked up the pace three wide near the quarter pole
then swept by in upper stretch, pulled away under a strong hand ride then finished in hand. EXCETERA raced in the last flight and hustled up along the rail
around the turn, angled out top of the lane, gathered momentum under steady encouragement and closed with response to finish second best. SATIN
FINISH was forwardly placed from the get-go and chased after the leader into the turn, raced in striking distance two to three wide at the quarter pole then
continued a steady bid for a share. SWEET SMOKIN GAL tracked the pace along the inside through early stages, slipped through along the rail entering top
of lane and given cue but lacked the needed response for serious impact. GOSPEL TIZ JOY raced in the last flight then six wide entering top stretch and
failed to kick on. TRULY CLASSIC raced off the top two flights with three furlongs left to run then raced five wide into the lane and failed to move on. EURO
BELLE led the way in the early going, raced under pressure around the turn then got collared entering top stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
GREEN EYED BELLE raced in tracking mode just off the top pair through the early going, remained confidently handled still in hand at the quarter pole,
edged up three wide top of the lane, dug in under pressure and edged by to take a slim lead, battled on two wide with a narrow advantage over stubborn
EKATI'S HIT in final stages and held firm under a driving finish. EKATI'S HIT raced off the early leaders, saved ground along the rail around the turn, cut the
corner and advanced into close contention, raced in striking distance of GREEN EYED BELLE while along the rail, stayed on stubbornly but could not get
by. LONG GONE OKIE was reserved in the back, hustled along six wide into the lane, found more under steady pressure and closed with response to gain
shaow. MISS TWENTY set a pressured pace through early going, continued with a narrow lead around the turn, got headed by eventual winner near the
eighth pole and gave way. HAPPYGOBUCKY chased the pace into the turn, stayed under pressure three to four wide turning for home but failed to move
on. PRINCESSOFCHITOWN raced near midpack after opening stages, urged five wide top stretch and no late kick. ANXIOLYTICS applied pace pressure
to the leaded in opening stages, stayed after rival to the quarter pole the failed to sustain bid. MORE IS MORE saved ground around the turn and lacked a
needed rally. BEBOP BABY was not far back in the opening quarter then failed to advance on the turn and had no late response.

APPLE COUNTY raced four to five wide entering the first turn, continued along the outside and settled nicely while rated off the early pace, remained
confidently piloted around the far turn then swung into action turning for home, responded under right-handed pressure, rallied along the far outside and got
up in time. BETTY JEAN raced in range down the backstretch and continued in contention around the far turn, was put to a drive five wide top of the lane,
steadily edged up closer to the lead then got denied when winner got up head up in final stride. MADISON'S QUARTERS was unhurried and saved ground
into the backstretch, launched a four wide bid in upper stretch, steadily moved up closer, was getting to the lead in final stages then got outfinished when
outside pair swept by. RARE POPPY stalked behind the leader to the far turn, launched a three wide bid and roused forward to take a slim lead in the final
furlong then lacked closing response to hold on. BERYL'S FLIGHT set the pace and held firm around the final turn, got collared for the lead upper stretch
and gave way. YANKEE PRIDE tracked the pace along the inside, came under a ride along the rail around the far turn, failed to advance then weakened in
the lane. WHEW raced in or near the back and failed to move into contention. BESTOW dropped back entering the far turn and jogged in.

Footnotes
WELDER moved up shortly after the start to challenge SHARE THE UPSIDE for the lead, continued on equal terms around the turn, shook the reins and
roused for more turning for home, picked up on cue and gained a slim advantage, remained determined along the inside under steady pressure and refused
to let SHARE THE UPSIDE get by. SHARE THE UPSIDE was away in good order and vied for the lead while racing along the outside of WELDER, battled
for the lead around the turn and continued to put in a good effort through the lane but could not get by the game winner. DIRECT DIAL hustled along near
the inside and saved ground around the turn, sustained a steady bid and prevailed for share. D' RAPPER chased the top pair through early stages, hustled
along three wide around the turn then flattened out and lost show. TIZ ALLUPTOME NOW raced off the early pace and lacked a needed rally. AMERICAN
DUBAI was a step slow at the start, raced in the back and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
MAYFAIR HEIGHTS was away in good order and moved in closer from the outside position heading into the first turn, stalked the pressured duo down the
backstretch, launched a three to four wide bid on then far turn, sustained response into the lane, continued to inch up closer on the late leader and got up in
time. FOXY ACE raced off the pace down the backstretch, hustled up mid-way around the far turn, stayed on with response along the outside through the
lane, steadily edged up closer in deep stretch and just missed. EXCALIBUR RIDGE was unhurried and raced in the back then swung wide entering top
stretch, responded when given cue, rallied along the far outside and gained a share. HEPUTTHEACEINRACE vied for the lead around the first turn and
continued to duel for command to the far turn, battled on into upper stretch, dug in and shook free, continued to put in a good effort but got wore down in
deep stretch. MY TRUE REWARD raced in range through early stages, hustled up three wide around the far turn, remained in contention at the furlong
marker then failed to keep pace. CHARGIN TEXAN vied for the lead around the first turn, continued to battle on around the far turn the tired in stretch run.
LISBON raced off the pace, saved ground around the far turn and lacked a needed rally. FROGGY showed brief response then retreated.
