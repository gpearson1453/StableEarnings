Footnotes
GOLDEN BET dueled from the outside early, remained engaged through the turn, shook loose entering the drive and steadily drew clear. FIERY FLASH
dueled from between rivals early, battled through the turn, was steadied at the eighth pole when in tight, recovered, responded and rallied late for the place.
I'M ALL MIXED UP dueled from the inside early, battled through the turn, remained forward but could not keep pace in the drive. QUEEN GIGI chased the
early pace outside, made a bid entering the drive but was too late. CHEROKEE BLESS forced the early pace inside but came up empty in the drive.
PRIMARY FIRST was no factor. BLISS LA VIE was no threat. GABY'S PROMISE was never close.

show. MISS BILLIE K chased the early pace from the inside, advanced through the turn, responded and had a late rally. PROMISE TENDER forced the
early pace inside but had nothing left. COSTA SUGAR was no factor. FANCY PANTS JEN was never close. TAP CITY BABY dueled from the outside and

Footnotes
EXTRA DOUGH dueled from the outside early, remained engaged up the backstretch, shook loose entering the drive, opened a clear margin then just
lasted late. SABER RUN stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the second turn, responded entering the drive but just missed.
FAR OUT TIME unhurried early from the inside, steadily advanced through the second turn, responded but could only gain the show. POPPI IS SMILING
was no factor. APPROVED bobbled at the start, rushed up inside to duel for the early margin, remained engaged up the backstretch then faded. D'YETI
MAN dueled from between foes and tired. SMOOTH GALLOP was never close.
