Footnotes
FLAT ROSE stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn, dueled with
TRIBUTE GALAXY through the second turn, responded and steadily drew clear. TRIBUTE GALAXY chased the early pace from the outside, dueled through
the second turn but could not match strides while holding position. DEVASTATING BEAUTY pressed the early pace from the inside, advanced through the
second turn but could not keep pace in the drive. OVERLY SWEET unhurried early from the outside, advanced through the second turn, responded but was
too late. ST MARIA could only improve position. BEAR TOOTH PASS allowed to settle early, steadily advanced up the backstretch, responded entering the
drive but flattened out. AUNT JANA was no factor. TOSHITA FOREVER was no threat. TAP THE CAT forced the early pace outside and faded. SASSY
SAPPHIRE broke sharp from the outside, gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch then gave way.

Footnotes
TWN PALMYSDESTINY stalked the early pace from the inside, dropped back slightly entering the second turn, awaited room on the second turn, got
through along the rail entering the drive, dueled through the drive and was along in time. MISS MABELEE unhurried early from the outside, steadily
advanced up the backstretch, dueled through the drive but could not match strides. ULTIMATE CHALLENGE well placed from the inside, advanced through
the second turn, dueled through the drive but could not keep pace. SWEET MILAGROS chased the early pace from the outside, remained forward but had
nothing for the drive. INSEPARABLE forced the early pace from the inside, dropped back up the backstretch, responded entering the drive but could only
improve position. WIND ZEE broke sharp from the inside, quickly gain the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, continued to show the way
through the second turn but came up empty in the drive. G G HAS A SHOT was no factor. PADDY O'BELLE was no threat. REDDING WELL forced the
early pace inside and faded. FLASH ANNIE showed little.
