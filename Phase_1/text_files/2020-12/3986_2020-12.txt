Footnotes
SERENADE A KITTEN broke to the lead despite bobbling a stride out, established an easy pace rating along inside, and stayed clear under pressure.
SMART SPENDING lunged at the start, lagged well back two wide for six furlongs, split horses rallying through mid stretch and finished well.
CHEERLEADER BARB saved ground on the turns, and offered a mild late response. SUM NATION tossed her head at the break, advanced three then four
wide approaching the stretch, brushed with BLUE EYE KITTEN into the lane, and rallied for the last major share. OKALANI was forwardly placed toward the
inside to the stretch, and weakened. NOT TONIGHT BOBBY broke outward, prompted the pace three then two wide to the head of the lane, and tired. TEN
PIN ALLY was four wide into the first turn, gained through the middle stages, then flattened out in the three-path. BLUE EYE KITTEN raced two wide in
midpack to the far turn, moved out a couple paths brushing SUM NATION at the top of the stretch, and continued to move further out in the course. SILVER
SKY SMOOTH raced three wide, and tired before reaching the stretch. SHINE A LIGHT prompted the pace outside to the far turn, and gave way.

MUSTANG CAT set a pressured pace along the rail and drove clear in the final sixteenth. BENEFACTOR tracked the pace from the rail, angled three wide
nearing the three-sixteenths pole, was unable to seriously gain on the winner through the lane but gained second in the late yards. SOUTH SEA pressed the
winner two wide and weakened in the final furlong. CANDY CRUSHEM was off slow, raced four wide and lacked a rally. RESIDENT was perched in range
three wide and came up empty in the lane. POWERFUL ALLY stumbled at the start, raced off the pace three and four wide and was eased through the lane.

SHANG'S SISTER saved ground to the far turn, moved out to challenge BROADWAY DIVA from outside after six furlongs, took over in upper stretch and
drove clear. IRAZU was forced out by LA PINTA at the start, dropped inside at the back soon after that, shifted out three wide approaching the stretch,
rallied through the late stages and brushed with JULIE BIRD while moving past that one into second. JULIE BIRD (IRE) clipped heels behind ISLA BONITA
approaching the first turn, moved off the inside beginning to advance leaving the far turn, and brushed with IRAZU as that one went past for the place late.
BROADWAY DIVA set the pace inside, and yielded to the winner coming off the far turn. SHAKEM passed tired horses. METAFORA saved ground to no
avail. V K STAR prompted the pace two wide, and tired after six furlongs. ISLA BONITA steadied in tight, moved out and was clipped behind by JULIE BIRD
going to the first turn, and dropped far back after six furlongs. SUPERIOR DRAMA tracked outside the leaders three wide to the far turn, and tired. LA
PINTA broke outward, raced four wide early, and was through after a half. SANGFROID was keyed up hard to handle on the first turn three to four wide, and
faltered before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
HARTLING pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead near the seven-sixteenths marker, drew clear approaching the quarter pole, opened up in
upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging through the lane and just lasted. GRACE'S DRAMA settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled five
wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and just missed. ASSUME CONTROL raced off the duel in the three path, was one-paced in the lane and gained
the show. PAYNTER FEST set a pressured pace in the two path inside of the winner and tired in the drive. POSTINO'S CHAMPION stumbled at the start,
saved ground off the pace, tipped out nearing the lane and passed tiring rivals. GRAN ETIQUETA failed to menace while racing three wide. LA TRES JOLIE
was outrun outside. LIL MISS HOTSHOT chased the pace inside and faded.

Footnotes
OUR LITTLE DEVIL sprinted right to the front, rated along clear in the two-path widening into the stretch, and was hand urged home never in jeopardy. LA
CARA BONITA raced two to three wide around the turn, rallied into second through the furlong grounds and proved best of the others. EFFIEMEISTER
saved ground into the turn before moving to the two-path, shifted out further in upper stretch and got up for the show. YELLEN chased the winner two wide
to the stretch, and was outfinished for third. LALALI raced four to five wide around the turn, and improved position through the stretch without threatening.
QUEEN ABARRIO was no factor inside. TRUE ATKA was never prominent. DINNER AT FIVE broke a step slow, and was always outrun. CAPELINE raced
in the second flight and lacked a solid response. REITERATE broke awkwardly at the back, and was outrun inside. TWINKIESANDTURNIPS chased inside
for three furlongs, and faded steadily. ROYAL MISTRESS raced three to four wide, and was through after three furlongs.

RED CRESCENT pressed the pace in the three path for five furlongs, drifted about five wide into the lane, soon reached about the ten path in upper stretch,
closed under right-handed urging and was up late. WEST WILL POWER settled off the early pace along the inside, angled to the three path nearing the
quarter pole, bid outside of the pacesetter nearing the eighth pole, took the lead leaving that marker but was outkicked late. EVERFAST raced up close

Footnotes
UNCLE FUN took the worst of a bump with THE CAPTURED STAR at the break, raced well back for six furlongs, came three wide into the stretch, and
finished determinedly to overhaul PUGIN from outside in time. PUGIN raced three wide on the turns, rallied to contention through upper stretch, reached the
front in deep stretch, but could not hold off the top one. HE AIN'T NO SAINT checked between horses approaching the backstretch, raced two wide in
striking range to the stretch, rallied to a short lead approaching the eighth-pole, but was outkicked from there. THE CAPTURED STAR bumped with UNCLE
FUN at the start, lost position inside through the middle stages, cut the corner rallying off the far turn, moved out a couple paths and finished willingly. LORD
FLINTSHIRE raced three to four wide in the second flight to the head of the stretch, and gained mildly without threatening. WESTERLY WIND raced well
back to the stretch two wide, and went by tired or troubled foes. I AM THE GREY was forwardly place inside to the stretch, and tired. BIG CITY RED broke
out at the start, got bumped and herded out by TURLOUGH at the top of the stretch, and ran on evenly. THE BEST DISTANCE set the pace inside for six
furlongs, bore out badly brushing SWEENEY'S CAT and carrying that rival out extremely wide at the top of the stretch, and dropped back. TURLOUGH got
pushed out by BIG CITY RED at the start, raced in striking range two to three wide for six furlongs, drifted out bumping into BIG CITY RED coming off the
far turn, and dropped back. SWEENEY'S CAT moved up five wide leaving the first turn, stayed in contention outside until being brushed and carried out
extremely wide by THE BEST DISTANCE at the top of the stretch, then was cautiously handled as BIG CITY RED and TURLOUGH came his way as well.
CAN'T BE BROKEN was four wide early, moved up through the middle stages outside, then gave way abruptly into the far turn. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENTS AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

BEASTER settled off the pace outside, went four wide around the turn, closed outside, took the lead leaving the sixteenth pole, switched back to the left
lead late and laid in a bit late and edged ahead under a drive. ENSIGN PARKER set a clear pace in the two path, drifted out under left handed urging in the
lane and yielded late. BRACCIO DI FERRO was off slow, raced well back in the four path and rallied widest to gain the show. TOP BOSS chased the pace
from the rail and had a mild stretch gain inside. ONEMORETIMEAROUND chased the runaway pacesetter in the three path in the clear around the turn,
continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a closing bid. CARAMEL CHIP was outrun inside. EMIT played no factor while racing two wide. SWAGGY
GEORGE hopped at the start, raced three and four wide and never threatened.

Footnotes
SEMPER FI prompted the pace three wide around the first turn, bid two wide into the far turn, took the lead midway around that bend, powered clear in
upper stretch and held clear under left-handed urging. THENORTHREMEMBERS was pinched back at the start, saved ground off the pace, made progress
inside around the far turn and finished willingly to gain the place. TROUBLE COFFEE was bumped at the start, raced two wide in midpack, angled three
wide nearing the lane, had aim in upper stretch but was one-paced through the lane. SOUTH POINTE DRIVE was pinched back at the start, raced well back
two wide early, made progress at the rail rounding the far turn, steadied off heels nearing the eighth pole, altered out soon after and finished with some
interest. ALL GOOD was squeezed back to the last at the start, trailed inside early, circled five wide around the far turn and passed tiring rivals widest in the
lane. MAVERICK KITTEN failed to menace while racing three and four wide. BURLY BOY never threatened while racing two and three wide. EMOJI GUY
was outrun while racing three and four wide. MR. AXEL chased the pace four wide and came up empty. ROUGH ENTRY set the pace inside and retreated
through the lane. EL PILLO was strung out five wide around the first turn and was through after a half. LOUIS LE GRANDE was in range inside, checked
while tiring midway around the far turn and offered no further response.
