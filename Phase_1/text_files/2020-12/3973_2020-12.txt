Footnotes
BETTER THAN PEARLS was allowed to settle on the inside,, rallied in the stretch in the two path with a quick burst and drew off late. DUNWOODY had
good position early, rallied at the quarter pole and drew even, was no match late for the winner but was second best. YOURS TRULY was unhurried early,
had a mild bid on the inside while no threat. GLITTER GIRL set the pace until mid stretch, then weakened late. IRISH THUNDER was allowed to settle and
failed to menace. KEE SHE tracked three wide and had no rally. CINS BOSS pressed the pace on the inside and faded. MS GIO POINT steadied at the
start and was outrun. SAMTASTIK flashed brief foot and was through after a half.
