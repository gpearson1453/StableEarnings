Footnotes
MY MISS MIRACLE steadily advanced from off of the pace down the backstretch to be in range of the lead four wide around the far turn, shifted six wide in
upper stretch, sustained his grind to get up approaching the wire before drifting out a bit, but just held off an inner bidding foe. LULLULA advanced to loom
just behind the pace setters two wide around the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch before splitting foes at the furlong pole, produced an inside bid late, but
just missed. KATIESDREAMGIRL stalked along the inside early on, but was restrained back into the backstretch, found traffic in upper stretch while
attempting a rerally, altered course outwards and produced a solid late kick. HONORARY GUEST was reluctant to load, prompted the pace three to two
wide, forged a narrow margin in upper stretch while drifting a bit outwards, then tired in the final sixteenth. SHORT CIRCUIT gained ground mildly five wide
around the far turn before sustaining a late rally for a minor share. GOODBYE CAROLINA prompted the pace two wide and between horses around the first
turn, took back to stalk, then came under a tight hold around the far turn when put to tight quarters as LULLULA rallied along side, saved ground before
making a bid inside of that foe inside the final furlong, but was outfinished. DREAMING OF AUDREY took up along the inside into the first turn, saved
ground from midpack, and chased through the stretch. ROUWAY bumped the gate slightly at the start, rated far off of the pace three wide, and stayed on
late. TEQUA lied forwardly placed four to three wide, vied around the far turn, but weakened through the final furlong. SMARTY QUEEN lied forwardly
placed two wide and between horses, but was done early. LA DAME set the pace inside a group of rivals, and weakened in upper stretch. SIP'N DIP
hopped a bit at the start, saved ground far off of the pace around the first turn, then five wide around the far turn, and failed to factor. Due to a timer
malfunction, this race was hand timed and internal fractions are unavailable

Footnotes
I GOT A SECRET took control after the start, rated along in the two-path clear to the stretch, drifted out while well in command through the furlong grounds
and was never in jeopardy. METEORITO bumped with ULTRACONFIDENT leaving the gate, swung five wide coming off the turn, and rallied outside to best
the others. ULTRACONFIDENT bobbled at the break and bumped with METEORITO a stride later, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and
finished evenly. EXPRESS BOY broke outward, saved ground in striking range for six furlongs, and lacked the needed late response. OLD MAIN dropped
back on the turn toward the inside, and tired. MAJORITY RULES was outrun three then four wide. LIQUID LOUIE pursued I GOT A SECRET from outside
for six furlongs, and tired. ELBRUS was urged up the backstretch with no response, and dropped far back into the stretch well out in the track.

Footnotes
SLIPPIN JIMMY tracked from off of the pace two wide and between horses, tipped four wide to be outside of the leading trio turning for home, blew past
those foes passing the furlong marker, then safely held SCOTTY BROWN's bid at bay. SCOTTY BROWN saved ground from midpack, tipped five wide at
the furlong pole after SLIPPIN JIMMY made first run, then rallied, but was only second best. CALIBRATOR stalked three wide, but was outkicked by the
eventual winner while attempting a bid at the furlong pole, then held place between rivals. RICKI TICKI TAFFI trailed, came into the lane the four path, and
stayed on to miss show. HUSHED HIJINKS chased the leader two wide while inside of a foe, produced a bid approaching the furlong pole as the leader
started to be pulled up, but was outkicked by the eventual winner passing that marker, then got outfinished by outer foes for minor rewards. SECRET
BOYFRIEND set the pace along the inside, scooted a bit clear turning for home, but took a bad step when changing leads and pulled up in upper stretch,
was untacked around the clubhouse turn, and vanned off. CRACK SHOT was off a step slow and taken in hand at the start, tracked from off of the pace in
the four path around the turn, but failed to respond to shoulder tap from the rider around the five sixteenths pole before being eased turning for home.

Footnotes
MAGICGIRL lost ground inside through the middle stages, got roused approaching the stretch while swinging out six wide, caught the leaders from outside
entering the final furlong and drew off. AUBURN was never far back, moved out four wide rallying past the quarter-pole, reached a short lead outside
JEANIE'S ANGEL in mid stretch, but was no match for the winner late. NATIONALIST took closer order after six furlongs, came five wide into the lane to
loom a threat, but could not sustain the rally. JEANIE'S ANGEL set the pace removed from the rail, drifted out and yielded to challengers coming to the
eighth-pole. MARIALUISA raced two to three wide on the turn, and could not reach contention. TWILIGHT GALAXY prompted the pace outside JEANIE'S
ANGEL for five furlongs, and tired approaching the stretch. SURPRISE ARRIVAL lunged outward at the break and was off a couple lengths slow, raced
three to four wide and was through early.

Footnotes
EXCHANGE DAY cleared early on before feeling pressure from ZAMFIR into and around the turn, then shook free from that foe in upper stretch, and held
sway under driving pressure. ZAMFIR rushed to press the clear leader from the outside into the turn, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch as
that rival scooted away, but kept on and chased well to rebid, but did not have enough to catch him. HEAVENLY BLESSING saved ground while stalking the
leaders around the turn, but failed to produce a bid before tiring late, and just held show. CARSON CITY KID pressed the pace two wide and between
horses, but faltered and lost position around the turn, then regained stride and kept on between horses through the lane, but missed reachieving show. MR
TINGLES tracked from midpack two wide, shifted three wide turning for home, then stayed on outside of foes, but missed show. C. P. A. GENIUS saved
ground while off of the pace, but to no avail. KING TARZAN lied off of the pace three wide around the turn, and failed to factor. FROZEN FUNDS was
jostled between horses a few steps out of the gate, got caught five wide while far off of the pace around the turn, and failed to make an impact.
COMMUNICATION FAIL took a bump to his hind quarters soon after the start, chased while well off of the pace four wide around the turn, and was outrun.

FIGHTRESS pressed the pace outside PINS AND NEEDLES from the outset, reached the front in mid stretch and edged clear, and was all out to stave off
PROPER MANNERS. The latter raced two wide to the stretch, bid outside the winner through the closing yards and just missed. TONY'S ROSE was
outsprinted four wide to the stretch, held her ground outside MRS. MAISEL getting bumped near the eighth-pole, kept that rival in and was up for the show.
PINS AND NEEDLES bumped with HY DOLLFACE at the start, emerged with the lead between horses approaching the turn, stayed on to the furlong
grounds and gave way inside. MRS. MAISEL steadied on the rail up the backstretch, attempted to move out and bumped TON'Y'S ROSE with an eighth of a
mile remaining, and ran on evenly in close quarters between horses. ROYAL JEWEL broke awkwardly behind the field, and was outrun. SILVER TUNES led
early inside, yielded to PINS AND NEEDLES into the turn, and weakened through deep stretch. HY DOLLFACE bumped with PINS AND NEEDLES at the
start, raced three wide into the turn, moved in a path approaching the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
WELL DONE WEST set the pace inside of a pair of foes down the backstretch, drew clear from those foes in hand at the three furlong pole, then widened
under driving pressure turning for home, and was ridden out under a vigorous hand urging late. NO MORE BUSINESS rated far off of the pace along the
inside, advanced while saving ground around the turn, shifted three wide to surpass chasing foes turning for home, and proved second best while hanging
on his left lead. EMPERADOR prompted the pace setter two wide and between horses, but was put to an all out drive while failing to keep pace with his
inner counterpart at the three furlong pole, sustained his chase turning for home, but tired through the lane. NOBLE EMPIRE pressed three wide, but failed
to keep pace with his innermost counterpart at the three furlong pole, weakened while drifting four wide turning for home, and was eased through the lane.
EMPEROR OFTHE NILE was outrun and showed little.

Footnotes
HONORABLE pressed the pace outside THINKABOUTIT, poked a head in front after six furlongs, edged away a sixteenth out, and was all out to hold off a
pair of onrushing rivals. SWEET PEARL fought rating going to the first turn, settled down in easy striking range up the backstretch, shifted out for the drive
and finished gamely to just miss between horses. CHAO settled in the middle of the field for six furlongs, moved out three wide coming off the far turn, went
a bit further out through the last sixteenth of a mile and just missed outside the top two. VIBURNUM bumped with TANTALIZING GAL at the start, saved
ground on the turns near the back, gained inside the top trio but did not have enough.. HADLEY was slowest away, raced two wide trailing to the stretch,
and posed no threat. THINKABOUTIT cleared to the early lead inside, fought back when headed by HONORABLE on the far turn, and stayed on to the
eighth-pole before giving way. STORMING LION raced three then four wide for six furlongs, had the rider drop the whip at the top of the stretch, and faded
away. TANTALIZING GAL bumped with VIBURNUM at the start, raced three wide and was finished after six furlongs.

Footnotes
SISTER HANAN saved ground from midpack around both turns, smoothly guided five wide turning for home, rallied outside of foes through the lane, and
reached the leader on the wire to dead heat for the win. BIENVILLE STREET stalked along the inside, then from the pocket around the far turn, effortlessly
tipped outside of the leader passing the three sixteenths pole, bid for the lead at the furlong marker, cleared off, but was worn down by an outer oncharging
foe on the wire and dead heated for the win. MARIAFOOT (FR) shied a bit between rivals after breaking a step slowly, tracked from midpack five to four
wide around the first turn but pulled forward under snug restraint into the backstretch, reached the lead at the half mile pole and cleared to the rail, showed
the way around the far turn and into the lane, but was headed by foes passing the furlong marker, then held show. STONE TORNADO (GB) saved ground
at the rear of the pack around both turns, rallied inside of foes through the lane, but failed to catch the tiring pace setter for show. DON'T BLAME JUDY took
up off of heels into the first turn, saved ground off of the pace thereafter before tipping to the five path in midstretch, then stayed on. JEZEBEL'S KITTEN
lied forwardly placed two to three wide, rallied four wide around the far turn to bid at the three sixteenths pole, but flattened out in upper stretch. LOVELY
LUVY rated far off of the pace two wide around both turns, and failed to factor. GOLDEN CURL bobbled a bit at the start, rated off of the pace two to three
wide around the turns, but was floated seven wide turning for home, and failed to factor. STARSHIP NALA cleared off into the first turn, but was headed by
a pulling MARIAFOOT (FR) at the half mile pole, allowed that foe to clear off and stalked her two wide around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch.
STARSHIP MALLOMAR stalked two wide, but weakened around the far turn, and was eased through the lane. This race was hand-timed, fractions are
unavailable.

Footnotes
BIRD MAP tracked from close range inside, moved out to go after GITANA approaching the stretch, collared that rival from outside a furlong out and drove
clear. GITANA grabbed the lead with an alert start, showed the way inside to upper stretch, could not withstand the winner and remained well clear of the
rest. EFFIEMEISTER bumped lightly with GALIT JAK at the start, swung four wide leaving the turn, and finished evenly to secure the show. CREATE A
STORY was forced out sharply at the break by LEO'S DIAMOND, went along a long way last early, moved inside entering the turn, came back out offering a
mild response in upper stretch and was along for the last major share. KATNISS KAN moved out five wide approaching the stretch, and could not reach
contention. GALIT JAK bumped lightly with EFFIEMEISTER at the start, chased early outside GITANA, and moved inside tiring late on the turn.
SHELLPHONE was finished early three wide. LEO'S DIAMOND veered out sharply at the start, was corrected and chased three wide, and was through
after a half-mile.
