SCHIFF'S CORNER broke sharp from the outside, quickly gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, widen the effort at the eighth pole
and held sway. TIZ ONE FEE chased the pace inside, steadily advanced through the second turn, responded but could only gain the place. MY LITTLE JEN
forced the early pace inside, remained forward but could not keep pace. LONE STAR DIVA pressed the early pace inside but could only improve position.
GIRL THIRSTY was no factor. DA DUE RUN RUN was no threat. DOUBLE RED pressed the early pace and faded.
