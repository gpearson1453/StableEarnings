stride in time. SCAMPERING GRAYCE broke sharp from the inside, gained the early margin, remained clear through the turn, held a clear margin at the
eighth pole but was caught the final stride. T J'S SUNSHINE forced the early pace outside, remained forward but could not keep pace in the drive. KIMMY
chased the early pace inside, responded entering the drive and had a late rally. BACK INTHAT ACTION pressed the early pace outside but came up empty
in the drive. STAR FASHION could only pass tired ones. GRACE'S GAL was no factor. MISCHIEF GIRL was no threat. CAROLS CUPCAKE was never
close. LIL BEAU PETE showed little.

Footnotes
INTERACTIF MOMENT broke in at the start, bumped with HOMELAND MESSA, then dueled from the inside for the early margin, battled up the
backstretch, gained a clear margin at the eighth pole then was all out late to last. HOMELAND MESSA was bumped at the start, close up from the outside,
inched closer entering the second turn, responded entering the drive, split rivals mid stretch but just missed. KURTS RAIDER forced the early pace from the
outside, dueled up the backstretch but could not keep pace in the drive. MINE INSPECTOR chased the early pace from the inside, remained forward but
had no late response. DUBNATION could only improve position. ZENS SECRET could only pass tired ones. GRAN RED was no factor. KYE'S ADDYCAT
dueled from the outside and tired. FLASH ME BACK was never a threat. LITTLE RED KID showed little.
