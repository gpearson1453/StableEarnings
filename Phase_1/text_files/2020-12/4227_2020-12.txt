split rivals on the turn and failed to menace. EPIGRAMMATIST saved ground and tired. HEATED BATTLE failed to menace. DUCK DUCKY GOOSE was
never a serious threat. THE BEAST AND I dueled inside then stopped.

UNBRIDLEDADVENTURE, between rivals early, moved to the rail, took the lead near mid stretch, drew off driving. ANISSA just off the rail, eased out far
turn, no match. GOBI raced two wide and passed faders. HOLA PRINCESS three wide and just off the pace, tired. DEEP CANYON was clear inside then
tired. CANOOCHEE saved ground and showed little. SILVER EXCESS between foes and just off the pace, tired.
