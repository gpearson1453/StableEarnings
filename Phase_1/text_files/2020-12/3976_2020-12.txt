Footnotes
HEATHER'S GOLD ducked in leaving the gate, bumped with SUPER STRIKE, stayed out from the rail while making the pace, edged clear on the turn and
widened under urging. SCOTTY SILVER broke slowly, advanced between horses, steadied in tight nearing the end of the backstretch and into the turn,
angled to the outside entering the final furlong and was eased up through the final sixteenth. BAVARIA was slow early, raced two wide around the turn and
made up ground inside horses through the lane. CHART CALLER broke in the air while slow from the gate, was slow early, stayed outside around the turn
and outfinished tired ones in an even effort. ONLY ONE WAY BACK ducked out, bumped with SPRITZER leaving the gate, stalked outside the winner to the
stretch and was tiring when steadied leaving the furlong grounds. An objection by Hernandez against the second finisher was not allowed. MISTER
ARANGUIZ was outrun. SPRITZER ducked in leaving the gate, bumped with ONLY ONE WAY BACK, wasn't far back in the three path to the stretch then
stopped. TRIAL BALANCE wasn't far back outside to the turn then stopped. SUPER STRIKE ducked out leaving the gate, bumped with the winner, was

Footnotes
CABBAGE PATCH sped to a clear lead just after the break, stayed out from the inside and was clearly best under urging. COURTING JENNY wasn't far
back outside, was bumped while in the three path entering the turn then weakened. OCEAN CONQUEST rallied the rail around the turn, steadied
approaching the lane while bearing out, came out between rivals in early stretch and continued evenly. DON'T FIGHT broke slowly, made a run in the four
path around the turn then flattened out in the drive. VANESSA'S SECRET advanced inside early, came out into COURTING JENNY nearing the turn,
stayed out from the rail into the stretch and weakened. DOCUMENTED didn't break sharply, raced the three path and failed to matter. FINDER ANGEL R V
F moved up between rivals early then tired. TROLL CROSSING was no factor. HOOF HOOF AWAY couldn't keep up.

unhurried early, raced the four path around the turn and gained through the lane. ART FORM lagged after a slow break, made a run three wide between
rivals around the turn then closed willingly. UNEMOTIONAL broke in the air, was slow early, raced the five path around the turn and closed well out into the
track. PINK rallied the rail around the turn then flattened out. DAMISELA stayed out from the rail while chasing the winner to the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
TANYA'S GEM wasn't far back inside early, came out into the three path on the turn while moving, took over in midstretch and drew out under mild urging.
LADY VALENTINA moved two wide to command early on the turn, edged clear before a half then gave way in the drive. LOOKIN KINDA CRAZY wasn't far
back in the two path to the stretch and lacked the needed rally. HILL VALLEY raced the three path and lacked a closing. MOON CHANT made the pace
along the rail into the turn then stopped in the lane. LADY A. G. was outrun. PREMIUM MOTION trailed after a slow break.

Footnotes
WICKED T broke in the air, was slow early, rallied three wide around the final turn, and was bumped while closing a gap in the final yards to get up. HOSS
KITTEN pressed two wide outside the early leader, moved to the front midway on the final turn, held a clear lead into late stretch, drifted late and bumped
the winner. An objection by Gonzalez against the winner was not allowed. KAY SYRAH SYRAH moved to a clear lead on the first turn, angled to the rail the
weakened in the lane. HEAVENLY HATTIE was slow early then found best stride too late. WITH ME WITHOUT ME was slow early, raced two wide around
the final turn and gained mildly. SUNSHINE BAY was close up early then stopped. LAST GREAT was no factor. POSITIVELY MINE showed speed then
stopped.
