Footnotes
TIZ JOHNNIE rated close toward the inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and improved at the rail rounding the far turn, eased just outside Sherwood
Lady in the upper stretch and dug in to take over the final yards. COUNTRY MAGIC stalked the pace from the two and three paths, picked up the chase
leaving the three eighths pole and raced five wide on the far turn, dug in to take second the final yards but was outfinished for the win. LONGSTORYLUCY
settled back off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn and finished well to take third. SHERWOOD LADY
rated a slim lead inside, was met into the backstretch and turned back Alpine Moon from that point, dueled clear of that one midway on the far turn, dug in
with the lead under steady stretch encouragement but was caught flattening stride the final yards. SO RED THE ROSE rounded the first turn about the four
path and settled close into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn then weakened. ALPINE
MOON entered the first turn in the five path and closed to contention to meet the pace-setter at even terms into the backstretch, engaged in close chase
from that point but dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened. SCOTTISH DENIS saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole but showed little response.

SINGLE MOM rated close to the early pace, gave chase from the three eighths pole and raced in range four wide on the turn, dug in from the head of the
lane to take the lead later yards and drew away. PRINCESS KOKACHIN angled to the inside and was hustled to the front nearing the three eighths pole,
came under pressure past the quarter, dug in under steady stretch handling but was caught in later yards. GREAT CAUSE chased the early pace toward
the outside, rounded the turn at the rail and dug in through the lane to finish well. PACIFIC GOLD set a pressured pace most of the opening three sixteenths
of a mile and gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the turn three wide and flattened stride the final furlong. LINEAGE pressured the early
pace and raced close at the rail on the turn before flattening stride. STOP TALKING chased the leaders from the outside and rounded the turn about the six

Footnotes
B J'S BIG BOY took a slim lead nearing the three eighths pole and was rated from that point, came under pressure leaving the turn and dug in under steady
encouragement to just last. RATLTRAP gave chase racing well off the pace, circled rivals six wide on the turn and dug in widest through the stretch to take
second the final jump while gaining on the winner. GRECIAN ADMIRAL set a pressured pace the opening three sixteenths of a mile then gave chase from
the three eighths pole, rounded the turn about the four path, finished well at the outside girth of B J's Big Boy but was nipped from second under the wire.
FAPPIANO ROCKET chased the pace inside, rounded the turn at the rail and raced evenly through the lane. MINI BOLT gave chase and rounded the turn
at the rail, though, showed little further. ISLAND CADGER engaged in close early chase then faded through the turn. LUC D'VERMONT broke a step slow
and was not a factor.

RIGHTEOUS MAN dropped back from early contention while saving ground, eased out with a bid into the backstretch and circled horses five wide on the far
turn, was carried a bit wider by Jacob T entering the stretch but dug in for the lead later yards and raced clear under the wire. TWOBITSARIDE settled off
the early pace in the three and four paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, angled three wide into the stretch,
dueled to the front mid-stretch but ceded in later yards. JACOB T saved ground off the pace then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn in the four path, drifted toward the head of the lane and finished evenly. WISH IN THE CASTLE settled off the pace and off the rail the
first turn, bid leaving the half mile pole, angled seven wide on the far turn and finished well; outside. CHESTNUT LIME saved ground off the pace, picked up
the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. PAGAN SMART rated a clear pace
inside, came under pressure toward the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was caught
mid-stretch and weakened. BRILLIANT IDEAS raced well back in the three path the opening turn and showed little response. MELDON rated off the pace
about the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then faded through the far turn.

leaving the turn but gave up the lead in the final strides. STOLEN BIZ broke in to make contact with Cristiano Boy then hustled to the front to set a
pressured pace, was caught approaching the quarter pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn then flattened inside the eighth pole.

INTOXICOLOGIST settled off the pace toward the inside the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the
lead at the five sixteenths, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in under steady encouragement to edge clear later yards.
SINGINDOWNTHELANE saved ground through the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and
contested at near even terms rounding the far turn, but drifted and dropped slightly back approaching the head of the lane and relented the final sixteenth.
MACKENZIE'S STAR settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and closed to the heels of Catherines Warrior
approaching the quarter pole, recovered stride to come around that one on the far turn then flattened out a distant third. FRENCH NOUGET raced with the
early pace, was headed at the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase from the seven sixteenths then flattened stride about the three path of the far turn. MANDY
rated off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole then flattened out in the four path of the far
turn. SECRETARIATS HONOR broke awkwardly and saved early ground. LADY ROZINA was not a factor. CATHERINES WARRIOR raced with the early
pace two deep and took the lead at the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, was caught into the far turn and weakened at
the rail through the turn.

FINAL SAY rated off the pace in the two and three paths, challenged three wide nearing the three eighths pole, took the nod past the quarter and dug in
determinedly to inch ahead of BROTHER CORBIN, who stalked the pace from the three path, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and raced close two
deep while between horses on the far turn, dug in gamely through the stretch but grudgingly ceded the final yards. CHARITABLE SPENNY rated a slim lead
inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, contested at even terms nearest the rail rounding the far turn, ceded the nod midway through
the turn and weakened leaving the eighth pole. WALL settled back off the rail the first turn, eased outward into the backstretch and started an outside bid
toward the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and showed little more. SASSY KING raced off the pace in the three and four paths then
showed little response through the backstretch. BACOLI settled well off the pace and off the rail, then showed little response through the backstretch.
SOUTHERN SAVIOUR stalked the pace inside, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
PUT POSITION stalked the pace from the three path, challenged leaving the half mile pole and contested the turn two deep while at a close disadvantage,
drifted a bit into the lane but took over past the eighth pole and was steadily handled to hold on well. CATTY KRYS rated off the pace about the three path
the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and finished well to take second later yards. EARNED THE
SHOT settled off the pace about the four path the opening turn, raced outside into the backstretch and picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn in the five path and dug in to take third the final strides. I AM I WILL settled back about the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three
eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened stride through later yards. SHEZA DANDY R F rated a slim lead and moved to the rail into the
first turn, came under pressure from the half mile pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, but dropped back past the eighth pole and
weakened the final sixteenth. GLORIOUS MYSTERY steadied off the heels of Sheza Dandy R F into the first turn then stalked that one two deep,
challenged leaving the half mile pole and dueled close through the backstretch, but dropped back toward the quarter pole and faded at the rail on the far
turn. SWEET LADY SUE was not a factor. SWEET TWEET showed no response through the backstretch and was eased.

STAR OF NIGHT stalked the pace two deep, challenged toward the five sixteenths pole and contested the far turn at a close disadvantage, but dug in under
determined stretch handling to take the nod the final strides. BRIDGING THE GAP rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths
pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was caught in the final strides. SEE YA
MANANA saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and finished evenly; a distant third. CAMERON

before flattening stride. SHE FIGURES settled back in the three and four paths, eased out into the backstretch and bid toward the three eighths pole,
rounded the turn in the four path and showed little more. DUBAI WAS LIT raced well off the pace in the four and five paths, bid mildly past the five
sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the five path. AZZURRA settled back off the rail and showed little response through the backstretch. B'S WILD
