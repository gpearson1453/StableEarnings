Footnotes
RAG TOP was taken back after the break, came well out into the track while content to lag, rallied five wide around the final turn, closed a gap in deep
stretch and was up. PRINCESS PALOMAR settled inside, moved to vie two wide midway on the final turn, drew out approaching the lane, remained clear
into deep stretch, gave way late then was vanned off after the finish. ATTENTIVELY steadied while not far back between rivals nearing the end of the
backstretch, came out four wide on the final turn, improved position into the stretch then lacked a closing response. ITSGOTTABEMYWAY was unhurried,
steadied in tight along the rail in early stretch then passed tired ones. LYDIA SWEETIE was caught wide around the first turn, raced four wide around the
final turn then stopped in the lane. UNPARALLELED moved clear soon after the break, made the pace in the two path for just over three-quarters, stopped
and was eased up. STRAIGHT MADNESS chased the early leader, stopped after six furlongs and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
ALLISON K stumbled badly leaving the gate, lagged early, rallied the rail around the turn, came out between rivals in early stretch and ran clear late. L. A.
HOUSE wasn't far back, raced two wide around the turn, drifted out some in midstretch then gained the place in the final yards. ROCKIN RUTH broke
sharply to make the early pace outside, pressed in the three path around the turn, regained a clear lead in early stretch then weakened late. NO QUESTION
was slow early, made a run four wide around the turn, steadied slightly in midstretch and continued evenly. An objection by Gonzalez against the second
finisher was not allowed. IL MIO AMORE showed speed inside for about a half then tired. STEADY ROCK found best stride too late. LADY A. G. was close
up outside early, raced five wide around the turn and tired. JUDGEMENT FREE broke through the gate before the start, was reloaded then was outrun.
FIRST FOREVER steadied in tight between rivals early on the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and stopped. OCEAN CONQUEST steadied in
tight between rivals early on the backstretch, was hustled between foes to a short lead before a quarter, remained out from the rail while in command to the
stretch then stopped.
