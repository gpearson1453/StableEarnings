KIMBERLEY DREAM stalked the pace, rallied three wide on the far turn, steadied a bit nearing the quarter pole, made the lead in upper stretch and drew off
under a hand ride. LITTLE MATILDA chased the pace into the far turn, made the lead, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was no match for the
winner. HIGH FIRE trailed near the inside, checked behind the tiring pacesetter midway on the second turn, shifted out to the seven path then closed a gap
late. BEST OF YOU chased the early pace and was through after a half. GRADY'S LADY sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace for six
furlongs then was used up.

off. JACK VAN BERG made the lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch and gamely held on for second. FAHRENHEIT stalked the pace
and finished with good courage in the seven path. DIGITAL STAR trailed into the stretch while racing widest and had a mild late rally near mid track.

Footnotes
ARTAVIA prompted the pace three wide, dug in under right handed urging and proved best in a stretch long drive. AMIGO'S AFFAIR broke in front, set a
pressured pace until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. EARLY DELIGH stalked the pace into the stretch and finished determinedly four wide.
GREAT PLAN was no threat. FLIGHT MISSION was no factor. JOSIE'S RIDDLE had speed along the inside into the stretch and faded late.

to settle, rallied determinedly in the four path through the stretch and got up for second. ADMIRAL GLEN dropped back after the start, advanced in the
seven path into the stretch then leveled off. DIAL MR PROSPECTOR failed to menace. BIG PERFORMER chased the winner into the stretch and
weakened along the inside. BRILLIANTBENNY had good early speed then faded. CALL ME QUICK was outrun. I'M THE NAVIGATOR raced wide and
trailed.
