Footnotes
SNOOP waited for room while behind the first flight for much of the backstretch and final turn, angled three wide nearing the stretch, drew even on the front
leaving the furlong grounds and was narrowly best. FINANCIAL FREEDOM was fractious in the gate, raced two wide with the pace and was outfinished in a
game effort. VOUCH made the early pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. HEART OF A WARRIOR bore out while with the pace around the first
turn, remained prominent three wide into the far turn then tired. KICHIRO tired. NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY trailed after a slow break.

reloaded, chased the pace along the rail into the turn then stopped. SKY GAZER R V F showed speed two wide into the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
CACTUS JACK had early position inside, came out three wide on the turn to vie, ran clear in early stretch and widened under urging. BIG DAVE was
shuffled back from between horses leaving the gate, lagged into the stretch then split horses in late stretch with a rally. CHITOWN swung out leaving the
turn and gained mildly outside. RIO ABAJO angled to the rail on the backstretch while pressing inside the early leader then weakened in the lane. MORGAN
S. made the pace two wide to the stretch then weakened. DOWNHILL RACER came out four wide on the turn while not far back then tired. TEN HUT came
wide into the stretch while outrun. THAT L D K IS MINE broke slowly, moved up inside then stopped. CHAMPAGNE CHILLS briefly showed speed.

opened a clear lead before going a furlong, angled to the inside then gave way in the drive. KULP improved position three wide on the turn then lacked a
further response. JEANMILLIE SCORESE made a run along the rail on the turn then flattened out. MISTER ARANGUIZ stayed inside around the turn and
failed to matter. AZZARRO broke slowly then was outrun. CHART CALLER was outrun. ZIA ADELIA was outrun. SPRITZER was fractious in the gate,
ducked in leaving there and was finished early.

PUMPKIN STAR was sent clear before going a furlong, stayed out from the rail while making all the pace and held. AIN'T MISBEHAVIN chased, came out
into the three path on the final turn and gained slowly through the lane. COASTAL HIGHWAY stayed inside, gave his best along the rail through the lane but
wasn't enough. MAIN COOL CAT was slow early, raced wide into the stretch and passed tired ones. THE BEST CANDY brushed with MCLEAN HOUSE
while not far back between on the backstretch then tired. HONOR MISSION was outrun inside. MCLEAN HOUSE brushed with THE BEST CANDY on the
backstretch then stopped.

rallied four wide between horses around the turn, gave his best between horses into the final furlong then flattened out. LUNAR IMAGE showed speed
outside, moved closer three wide on the turn then faded between horses in the lane. MOOCHIE MAN was reluctant to load, made up ground too late.
FUDGE was slow from the gate then made up ground outside. GOLDEN VIPER was no factor. NO SENSE steadily bore out under left hand whip through
the lane. GIVETHEMAN A CIGAR tired three wide. RACEHORSEINARED made the pace two wide between horses to the stretch then stopped.

Footnotes
JENNYANYSPOT stalked outside, moved clear into the far turn and widened under urging. MOUSE CAT checked along the rail after moving into tight
quarters into the first turn, wasn't far back in the three path around the final turn then weakened. An objection by Chiappe against the winner was not
allowed. NOT MY MONEY raced three wide around the final turn and lacked a rally. SHOW MAID improved position along the rail through the lane.
PRINGIPESSA was no factor. FAVORITE DOLL made a wide run around the final turn then tired. TRIBAL PRINCESS made the early pace along the rail
then stopped. CYBERSPACE was outrun. CHECKING THE MARK stopped and fell far back.
