UTTERLY ENCHANTING stalked the pace, saved ground throughout and finished well to get up late under strong encouragement. ADABEL pressed the
pace, gained command nearing the eighth pole, raced in the five path through the stretch and finished second best. SCARLET TANAGER set all the pace,
raced three wide through the lane and weakened a bit in the final stages. COUGAR VISION was allowed to settle early, raced five wide at the three
sixteenths pole and had no late response. EXPECT TALK was unhurried early, saved ground down the backstretch, raced five wide at the eighth pole and
never was a factor. TRADING CENTS dropped back early, raced six deep into the upper stretch and never threatened.

SO DIALED IN sprinted clearly early on, raced along the inside throughout and was well clear through the lane while racing in hand to be much the best.
END ALL GET ALL was allowed to settle early, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and was no match for the winner. MANKLIN CREEK stalked the
pace from the outside, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and had no final bid in the drive. GOLDIE'S BOY stalked the pace, saved ground and
had no response. DOUBLBARRELBOURBON was slow early, raced four wide through the lane and never was a factor. STRICTLY BUSINESS broke to the
inside, bumped with rival, raced four wide past the eighth pole and never threatened. LUXERO was bumped at the break and never menaced.

Footnotes
UNBEKNOWNST TO ME stalked the early pace, moved up two wide to challenge the leader into the upper stretch and prevailed in a long drive under
strong handling. DESPITE ODDS showed good early speed, raced along the inside and just missed in a long drive with the winner. JOHNG settled off the
early pace, awaited room nearing the three eighths pole, raced three wide in the lane and had not enough. BLUE SKY PAINTER stalked the pace, saved
ground and had no late response. SUPER HOUDINI dropped back early, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. MCQUEEN'S
BULLITT was unhurried early on, raced five deep into the upper stretch and never threatened. ROOF TOP BAR was off a step slow, steadied around the
first turn, raced back early on and never menaced. MO AMERICAN stalked the pace from the outside and failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
BOSS LOGIC showed good speed along the inside and drew off to be well clear under steady handling. INDIAN LAKE pressed the leader, raced two wide
and was no match for the winner in the drive. BRIBERY settled off the early pace, saved ground around the far turn through the lane and had not enough.
SILVER SUN was squeezed back at the break, stalked the leaders while racing three wide and had no final bid in the drive. THEDUKE OF HAZZARD raced
three wide past the eighth pole and failed to respond. PASSAGE OF LINES was slow early, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.
JUST NOD AND SMILE dropped back early, was fanned seven wide into the stretch and never was a serious threat. LITTLE LION failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
INVEST showed good early speed from the inside, built a clear lead into the upper stretch and held gamely under strong handling. DASHING LOU stalked
the pace, was steadied briefly nearing the five eighths pole, raced towards the inside through the far turn through the stretch and was no match for the
winner. IN HIM WITH HIM pressed the leader while racing two wide and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. WOODBURY was unhurried early on,
raced five wide at the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive. WILD ABOUT DEB stalked the pace along the inside and tired the final quarter
of a mile while racing three deep. IRISHTOWN settled off the early pace and failed to respond. MOTI trailed throughout.

Footnotes
IMAGINE VICTORY was allowed to settle off the early going, moved up five wide nearing the eighth pole, surge late and got up in his final stride under left
handed urging. ALONG THE WAY stalked the pace, gained command around the far turn, raced four deep at the three sixteenths pole, led late and was
caught on the wire to just miss in a game effort. MISS PHILLY DILLY stalked the pace, raced six wide in the lane and had not enough in the drive. STEELY
BAND was off a step slow, dropped back off the early pace, was steadied at the half mile pole while racing along the inside and had no response in the
stretch. MALICEINTHEPALACE was slow early, saved ground around the far turn into the stretch, came out four wide briefly through the upper stretch,
angled back in to race towards the inside and never was a serious threat. RUNNING ON ENTRY dropped back early, raced six wide into the upper stretch
and never threatened. NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE set all the pace and gave way while racing off the inside in the stretch. ZOLA B pressed the leader,
steadied at the quarter pole and tired in the drive.
