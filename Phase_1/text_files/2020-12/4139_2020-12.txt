foes entering the stretch and finished very strong to win going away. NOVA vied in between rivals for the lead on the backstretch, entered turn two wide,
shook clear at the top of the stretch, gamely kept to task in the three path, overtaken late while clearly second best. ASKIN' FOR TROUBLE broke out and
bumped rival at the start, tracked leaders in between rivals on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, eased out widest in the stretch and rallied up for third
late. MELCHIOR vied for lead along the rail in a three horse duel, entered turn along the inside and had to steady out of position on the turn, re-engaged
and entered the stretch along the inside, kept on well through the stretch and edged out late for third. MYSTIC GREY bumped solidly at the start and had to
steady sharply, asked early to move into contention and tracked leaders along the inside, stayed along the inside into the stretch and kept on in the stretch
finishing evenly. ZACHIAN vied for contested lead three wide on the backstretch, entered turn three wide and into the stretch in the four path, kept to task in
the stretch and gave way in deep stretch. IF I HAD A NICKEL tracked leaders in between rivals on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and faded when
asked in stretch. FANCY TERRACE broke in and bumped MYSTIC GREY at the start, tracked leaders four wide on backstretch and three wide on the turn,
came up empty when asked in the stretch. REIGN ON (GB) lacked speed early and fell far back quickly at the start, settled well off the rail in the backstretch
and into the turn and never involved therafter.
