inside rival around the turn and into the stretch, put away that rival nearing the eighth pole while also drifting to the inside, met the late challenge from the
winner and yielded in the closing moments. WRITE ME A SONG chased off the inside, three to four wide into the stretch and got up for the show. ROYAL
SEEKER stalked the pace in the two path into the drive, angled out in upper stretch and got edged for the show. PROUDTOBESICILIAN vied for the lead
from inside, dueled around the turn and into the lane, fought back to the eighth pole then weakened late. QUALITY LINE trailed the field early, angled in
nearing the turn, exited two wide then moved to the inside in the stretch and passed tired rivals. LADIES MAN tracked off the rail, three to four wide into the

Footnotes
MINOSO stalked the pace early the gained command past the half-mile pole, met the challenge of NO PARKING HERE around the turn and into the stretch,
cleared that rival at the three-sixteenths pole, drew away under urging and geared down near the wire. BOB'S SNIPER away quickly then chased from off
the inside, came four wide into the stretch, angled out and rallied for the place. NO PARKING HERE stalked from outside, bid alongside MINOSO on the
turn, could not go on with the winner in the late stages and lost the place. TROMADOR chased outside a rival, three to four wide into the stretch, summoned
a mild rally and showed late interest between foes late. GALLOPING MISCHIEF showed early speed then chased outside a rival, entered the lane three
wide and flattened out. LEPRINO tracked off the inside, four wide around the turn and weakened. BARBIERE had early speed from inside then chased the
top pair into the turn, raced a bit off the rail leaving the bend and weakened. SUANCES SECRET raced three wide into the stretch, angled out and never
threatened. CALDER VALE chased off the inside then four wide exiting the turn, came in some in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
WESTERN RULE tracked off the inside, ranged up four wide turn, led into the stretch, kicked clear near the three-sixteenths pole and held late. PIZZA
CHARLIE settled off the pace, raced four wide into the stretch then angled out, put in a late bid outside the winner but was not enough. BIG ENDEAVOR
closest to the leader while outside, bid between rivals around the turn, vied three to four wide into the stretch, could not match the top pair late but stayed on
to secure the show. MY CHILD SBUD stalked the pace up the backstretch, inside through the turn, in range in the drive but lacked the necessary late
punch. PRESTO BENCH chased four to five wide around the turn and kept on in the late stages. CALL SIGN LUCKY sped to the front and angled in, vied
with a pair of rivals around the turn and into the stretch then gave way. RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT chased outside a rival, three wide into the lane and never
rallied. FLASH OF GLORY saved ground chasing the pace and was never a factor. FLACTEM LEGACY traveled two wide into the lane and had little left for
the drive. RAISE A HALLELUJAH steadied at the start and never got involved.

Footnotes
BIG BAD GARY stalked the speed off the inside, raced three wide around the turn then came out into the stretch, rallied from outside and headed the leader
at the eighth pole and drew clear under a drive. CAPTAIN N. BARRON brushed from outside at the start, dueled for the lead then vied between through the
turn and into the stretch, battled down the lane but was overtaken by the winner. D K'S CROWN dueled from inside then vied for command around the turn
and into the lane, could keep pace in upper stretch but stayed on and came back to earn the show honors. RINESHAFT chased five wide through the turn
and finished willingly for a minor award. LUCKY ROMANO vied four deep into and around the turn, fought outside pair of rivals in the lane and weakened
late. SHAKE N FRIES shifted in at the start, vied three deep then between rivals in the lane and also weakened late. CRYIN' CHUCK bothered from outside
rival at the start, unhurried in the beginning, traveled two to three wide around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and never responded to urging. EARLE
GRAY saved ground from off the pace and proved no menace. SHOW BUSINESS lacked early speed from outside, angled in on the turn then angled out at
the top of the lane and was never a factor. DARK AND DANDY broke in and brushed rival leaving the gate, saved ground into the lane, came a bit off the
rail in the drive then angled back to the rail at the three-sixteenths and weakened.

TRUE MISCHIEF off alertly from the outside, went outside a pair of rivals into the turn, stalked the top pair three deep on the backstretch, closed in four
wide around the far turn, took over past the quarter pole, drifted out then back in then drew off. SLEW'S SCREEN STAR dueled outside a rival for
command, lost a bit of ground on the backstretch then re-bid at the seven-sixteenths pole, led past the three-eighths, lost command inside the quarter pole,
could not match the winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. MOREAVINO settled off the inside, came out into the stretch and finished a clear
third. GOTTA BE LUCKY raced off the pace from inside, angled out on the second turn and closed mildly for a minor award. ZAGRAH (GB) came away
awkwardly at the start, stalked along the inside then two wide into the stretch, angled out and failed to rally. ROCKETANN sped to the front and angled over
to the rail, dueled into the backstretch then inched away from outside rival, challenged again into the far turn, lost command past the three-eighths, chased
two wide into the stretch and faded. ELEGANT SILK stalked two to three wide then between foes into the backstretch, three wide into the lane and
weakened. TURKISH ANGEL off a bit slow and broke out leaving the gate, traveled two wide around the first turn, along the rail on the second and was
never a factor. MIRA LOMA MADAM tucked inside on the first turn, two wide into the stretch and was always outrun. ICE ANGEL went three wide into the
stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
FRATELLI prompted the pace from outside, headed rival at the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, took the lead near the three-sixteenths pole,
cleared inside rival, drifted in late and inched away. WINE AND WHISKY tracked three wide then swung out into the stretch, rallied through the drive and
earned the place honors. LET'S REJOYCE set the pace under pressure from the outside, got headed at the five-sixteenths pole, maintained a short lead in
upper stretch, lost command at the three-sixteenths pole and held the show. BRONN stalked outside the top pair, went four to five wide around the bend
and kept on through the final furlong. NATURAL HISTORY raced near the back of the pace, was along the rail into the turn, came a bit off the fence into the
drive and improved position. TIZHOTNDUSTY stalked the pace early and angled over to the inside, traveled a bit off the rail leaving the turn and flattened
out in the late stages. ZORICH unhurried in the beginning, exited the bend five wide and failed to respond to urging. NONNO'S POLARIS threw head and
shuffled back at the start, traveled two to three wide and failed to threaten. BAM BAM AGAIN went three wide into the turn, angled out and entered drive six
wide and was never a factor.

late stages. LA AGUILILLA chased five then six wide around the turn and bested the rest. SHYLOCK EDDIE settled off the pace from the far outside went
five wide around the turn, finished willingly and earned the show. FELONY ONE pressed the pace from outside, could not match the winner around the turn
and chased four wide into the drive and weakened. EYE ON TIGER checked between early, angled to the two path, raced outside a rival then three wide
into the stretch, angled out in the lane and improved position. MIDNIGHT SUNRISE showed early speed between foes, bumped with outside rival early,
chased leaving the backstretch, traveled two wide into the lane and weakened. WISHFUL had early speed three deep then chased into the turn, angled in
around the bend and weakened. HOT ON THE TRAIL stalked the pace from inside and never threatened. BLACK DROP stalked the speed in the early

WITH DUE CAUSE up close outside the leader, bid outside at the five-sixteenths pole, lost contact with rival mid-stretch, came back in the final sixteenth
and nailed foe at the wire. GOV FROM ABOVE set the pace inside rivals, moved clear at the seven-sixteenths pole, challenged from outside in the lane and
drew clear again nearing the furlong grounds, challenged again in the closing moments and was nailed by the winner. LUCKY RYAN SEVEN showed early
speed and traveled five deep early on, chased four to five into the lane, drifted inward in the stretch and edged SEIZETHEDAY REXY for the show.
SEIZETHEDAY REXY attended the pace four deep, chased three to four wide around the turn, drifted inward in the stretch and got outkicked for third. MR.
CLUTCH traveled off the pace then steered to the inside, traveled two wide into the stretch then finished evenly along the inside. NOBLE PURSUIT chased
two wide on the turn then angled to entering the stretch and lacked a rally. RUN MANNY RUN up close three deep early, dropped back three wide around
the turn and weakened. LUNADEMIEL saved ground around the bend and was never a factor.
