Footnotes
NITRO TIME cleared off in hand, managed a loose lead around the turn, widened under mild shoulder taps in upper stretch, and was wrapped up through
the final furlong. TODAYSTHEDAY saved ground while forwardly placed, claimed place inside of rivals in upper stretch while proving no match for the
leader, and was second best. RUB MY BELLY lied forwardly placed three wide, shifted down from the four path to the three path around the five sixteenths
pole which put BLAME CHARLIE into tight quarters, then stayed on to just catch TWIRLING FIRE for show on the wire. TWIRLING FIRE chased along the
inside early on, shifted to the two path into the turn to attempt a mild bid outside of the clear leader turning for home, but failed to keep pace with that foe in
upper stretch, weakened, and was nailed on the wire for show. DEPUTY INDY tracked from off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, then
stayed on to vie for a minor share through the lane, but drifted out through the final furlong, and hung for show. MINDSHIP Q lied far off of the pace two
wide around the turn, and failed to threaten. FORTY FLASH was bumped by rivals on both sides at the start, raced far off of the pace three wide, and was
no factor. VALEROSO bumped an outer rival at the start, raced far off of the pace inside of horses, and did not make an impact. BLAME CHARLIE broke
inwards, pressed the pace two wide while under urging, began to falter into the turn, then steadied when put to tight quarters by an outer foe around the five
sixteenths pole, and was done early. OLD MAN MAC hesitated at the start then shied mildly right after, took the turn in the four path well off of the pace, and
never got involved. V. I. P. WHO broke in and bumped a foe at the start, and was outrun.

Footnotes
IT'S A RISK tracked the pace between rivals down the backstretch, angled out nearing the lane, was driven along three wide from the half-mile pole, grinded
away outside through the lane, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. HARPER GO LUCKY settled off the pace two wide, angled four wide
near the quarter pole and rallied for the place. SENZAZIONE lacked early speed while saving ground, tipped out near the quarter pole and rallied between
rivals. YES FOR LESS lacked speed, raced three wide around the turn, came five wide into the lane and had a mild gain. NIMBLE BEAST stalked the pace
two wide, seized command nearing the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch and tired nearing the sixteenth pole. MIDNIGHT WHISKEY sprinted clear soon
after the start, set the pace along the rail and caved in the lane. PRICEY VICTORY chased the pace outside, got out around the turn and retreated in about
the twelve path in the lane. REVOLVING STAR was outrun while racing four wide. MIGHTY FAST chased the pace inside and was through after a half.

Footnotes
NO QUE NO hopped a bit at the start, rushed reach the lead soon after, set the pace along the inside around the turn while feeling pressure from
ROCKSTAR RO, shook clear of that foe in upper stretch, and held sway through the lane. LUCKY LAW (IRE) lied off of the pace in the two path around the
turn, swung four wide turning for home, and rallied to just reach place at the wire. ROCKSTAR RO prompted the eventual winner from the outside around
the turn, but failed to match strides with that foe in upper stretch, chased him through the lane, but was nailed on the wire for place while under mild flagging
in the late stages. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA stalked three wide, but failed to produce a bid before getting outkicked in midstretch, and chased the leaders home.
SHAFTESBURY lied off of the pace in the three path around the turn, got floated five wide turning for home, but lacked a rally. SANCTIFIED lagged behind
the field around the turn, and passed tired foes through the lane. MUTARAAFEQ stalked two wide and between horses, but weakened on his left lead
through the lane. CHIEFICIA lied close up along the inside early on, but weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
COMP'D set the pace along the rail, drew off in upper stretch and widened under mild urging. YOU'RE THE BEST made a three wide gain around the far
turn, bid nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the winner in the lane and stayed on for the place. GOOD SHABBOS chased the pace three wide, came
four wide into the lane and was one-paced through the stretch. UPTOWN QUEEN stalked the pace two wide and faded in the lane. ADDI saved ground to
no avail. GILDED LADY was bumped between rivals at the start, chased inside and tired in the lane. CHATTIN WITH JENNY played no factor while racing
three wide. WATER WIZARD broke out and bumped GILDED LADY outward, saved ground and played no further factor. THEYCALLMEPRINCESS was
bumped at the start and was outrun while racing three wide. MISS UNCAPTURED was bumped between rivals at the start and made little impact inside.

ORENCIA tucked in into the first turn, saved ground from midpack before rallying two wide around the far turn, bid outside of the leaders passing the furlong
pole, and drove clear in the late stages. MY LIPS ARE SEALED cleared the field and shifted down to the rail into the first turn, felt stern pressure from
CENTSLESS DRAMA down the backstretch causing them to open up a margin, dueled inside of that foe around the far turn before repelling him in upper
stretch, but offered little resistance to ORENCIA passing the furlong pole. CENTSLESS DRAMA prompted the pace two wide, applied heavy pressure to the
pace setter down the backstretch causing them to open up a margin on the rest of the field, sustained the duel around the far turn, but was repelled by her
inner counterpart in upper stretch. INDICIA saved ground around both turns, and rallied along the rail through the lane for a minor share. BABYBEL broke
inwards and bumped a foe at the start, settled far off of the pace two wide, and failed to factor. SPIN YOUR PARTNER stalked three wide around the first
turn, allowed her inner rivals to open up down the backstretch, tucked to the rail into the far turn, but weakened thereafter. TOPO GRIGIO tracked from
midpack two to three wide around the turns, and tired through the lane.

Footnotes
DIGITAL FOOTPRINT tracked the pace from the rail for six furlongs, tipped out in upper stretch, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and just lasted. BEE
CATCHER raced in range while hung out four wide throughout, closed determinedly, reached even terms late and lost the bob. SHINING THROUGH
bumped with PROSPECT PROJECT at the start, raced off the pace two and rallied between rivals. SHARETHEBLAME saved ground off the pace, went two
wide between foes around the far turn and rallied belatedly. ONE EYED JACK prompted the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. DILIGENT set the
pace along the rail to the sixteenth pole and weakened. BAD BOY E. J. failed to menace while racing two wide. MAVERICK KITTEN broke inwardly, raced
three wide between foes and lacked a rally. GUESS FIRST was in tight at the start, raced three wide and made little impact. TIZ LIGHT THE WAY stalked
the pace three wide and came up empty. POWER (BRZ) was in range two wide but was through after a half. PROSPECT PROJECT was pinched back at
the start, raced four wide throughout and was never a threat. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
ZAAJEL shifted out from behind kickback through the early stages, perched four wide in pursuit of the pace setters, inched forward while shifting down three
wide, then two wide into the turn, vied outside of MAIL ORDER around the bend before assuming command approaching the quarter pole, then drew off and
widened willingly under driving pressure through midstretch. UNBRIDLED D'ORO lied far off of the pace in the five path around the turn, and rallied through
the lane to claim place passing the sixteenth pole. TAYET stalked along the inside around the turn, shifted three wide turning for home to surpass the early
pace setter for place in midstretch, but was worn down by another foe for that position a sixteenth out. MAKE ME LAUGH had his back legs slip from
underneath him at the start, saved ground off of the pace, and improved along the rail through the lane. CAJOLE advanced from off of the pace in the three
path around the turn, shifted inwards in upper stretch before drifting back out through midstretch, but leveled off before threatening. MAIL ORDER set the
pace along the inside, vied inside of the eventual winner around the turn, but proved no match for that rival approaching the quarter pole, and weakened.
SHANNON chased three to two wide and between horses early on, but weakened passing the three furlon gpole. BONNIE'S THE BEST tracked from
midpack along the inside, but was through after a half mile. MISSION UP lied off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and was done early.
BREEHAZEL had his head turned a bit to the inside when the gate opened and was off a step slowly, tracked from midpack in the five to four path, but
stopped and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
SCAR prompted the pace three wide early on, forged an advantage passing the half mile pole, managed a lead two wide and between horses around the
turn before meeting his inner counterpart's rebid turning for home, dug in gamely as that foe inched a very narrow margin, battled on while exchanging
brushes, and achieved victory via a photo. NACHO PAPA leaned against the inner part of the gate when the stalls opened, rushed to grab a lead leaving the
cute, vied inside of a pair of foes around the turn before rebidding for the lead turning for home, dueled gamely through the lane inside of SCAR while
exchanging brushes with that rival, but lost the photo on the wire. GREEN MANSIONS lied close up along the inside, stalked into the turn before being put
to an all out drive at the quarter pole, shifted three wide in midstretch, and sustained a rally to make a late bid outside of the dueling leaders, but did not
have enough to catch them. STARSHIP APOLLO stalked two wide, ranged up three wide turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch before
weakening passing the furlong pole. CHARLIE THE GREEK advanced from off of the pace to lie in range four wide around the turn, but failed to produce a
bid and chased evenly through the lane. DARDANELLOS trailed early on, took the turn in the four to five path, and was outrun. FIRST AND THREE was
done early.

THE VIRGINIAN set a pressured pace along the rail, drifted out under left handed urging late and just lasted. STATION ROCK settled off the pace while
racing two wide between foes, rallied through the lane and just missed. KYLE pressed the winner two wide, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, fought on
widest, was forced out by the winner late and was narrowly outfinished. TALE OF KANTHAROS saved ground in range and went evenly. NICHOLAS ROSE
stalked the duel three wide and was one-paced in the lane. DECKOLOGY saved ground to no avail. RAY'SWARRIOR was outrun while racing three and
four wide. DIDNT DO IT played no factor while racing three and four wide.

MR. TIP stalked two to three wide around the turns, bid for the lead in upper stretch, and drew off through the final furlong. MAX'S CAUSEWAY tracked
from midpack in the two path around the turns, tipped three wide in upper stretch, and rallied to reach place in the final sixteenth. BODIE CODY stalked
along the inside, inched forward to vie for the lead two wide and between horses at the half mile pole, forged an advantage and showed the way around the
far turn while outside of a foe, but was headed by the eventual winner passing the furlong marker, then held show. MR. WHO rushed to vie for the lead two
wide into the first turn, pulled and was steered out to the six path into the backstretch to settle, sustained stalking position while shifting down to the four
path around the far turn, then chased evenly thereafter. YADI settled off of the pace while caught in the four path around both turns, then chased the leaders
home from the five path. CAN'T HAVE ENOUGH lied far off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, shifted to the four, then five, path around the
far turn, and improved. EL SOLITARIO tracked from midpack in the three path around both turns, and failed to menace. JEGOS FIRE hopped at the start
and was off poorly, tugged while far off of the pace in the two path, and was no factor. BIG TREASURE lied off of the pace in the two path around both
turns, and never got involved. CHURCHILLS VICTORY set the pace along the inside early on, vied inside of a foe aorund the far turn, but weakened at the
quarter pole, and caved through the lane. RIGGINS was off a step slow and bumped an inner foe at the start, took the turns in the three to five paths while
well off of the pace, and failed to rally. MR TITO'S saved ground off of the pace, then steadied behind an early pace setter in midstretch and was protected
thereafter.
