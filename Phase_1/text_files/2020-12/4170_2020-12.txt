BUSHIDO SAMURAI stalked the early going from the inside, advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn, altered
outside, dueled through the second turn and was along in time. SOUTHPINE GIFT dueled from the outside early, battled up the backstretch, remained
engaged through the second turn but could not match strides with the winner. KING ZIPPY dueled from the inside early, fought up the backstretch,
remained forward but could not keep pace. CANYON FIRE chased the early pace outside but had nothing for the drive. SUNNYONASTORMYDAY was
never a factor. GUILTY AGAIN had little interest.

MASTERLY dueled from the outside early, gained a clear margin up the backstretch, remained clear through the second turn, widen the effort at the eighth
pole and held sway. GENTRIFIED outrun early, steadily advanced outside, reached a striking position entering the drive, responded but could not reach the
winner. TABIA pressed the early pace from the outside, remained forward but could not keep pace in the drive. BROADWAY ICE chased the early pace
inside, dropped back up the backstretch, responded and rallied late. BUXTERHOOTER went evenly. HALFMOON REEF dueled from the inside early and
tired. REDDY TO BET was never close. BLENDED LUTE had a steady fade.

gained the margin at the eighth pole and was well clear while kept to task. LANEYS LOVE forced the early pace from the outside, remained forward entering
the drive but was no match for the winner while holding the place. WENEEDTOTALK unhurried early from the inside, dropped back entering the second
turn, altered outside for the drive and closed with a rush for the show. AMELIA MADELYN broke out at the start, chased the early pace from the outside,
inched closer entering the second turn, responded and had a late gain. MISS NEKO went evenly. LOVE AND LEMONS was off a step slow, forced the early
pace outside but came up empty in the drive. ANGEL CAT could only pass tired ones. ALL FORE KICKS was never close. HARLANS WARRIOR dueled
