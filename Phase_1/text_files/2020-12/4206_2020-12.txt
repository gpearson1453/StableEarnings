G'S DEADLINE saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer while urged in the two path on the far turn, found room into upper stretch,
made a bid inside the leader at the eighth-pole, shook clear into the final sixteenth and drew away under steady urging. KRAFT'S RATE went three wide on
the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the two to three path on the far turn, took the lead at the
quarter-pole, turned into the stretch under the whip, led into the final furlong then was headed by the winner and proved no match while able to get the
place. JUANANDORA went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four to five wide on the far turn and lacked the needed
kick while able to get the show. SUPERSPORT SALLY went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, moved closer while urged along the
rail on the far turn, steadied while blocked at the three-sixteenths, found room before the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. DORI'S BIRDIES
went three wide on the first turn, was urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the far turn, moved off the rail under a drive in upper stretch, shifted
further out around the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten then stumbled and fell past the wire before regaining her feet then being subsequently vanned
off. TEARS FOR PAULA went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the front on the outside, moved out while roused late on the backstretch, chased
three to four wide on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and came up empty. ALL IN BRONSON broke out then hit the gate and was last
away, went four to five wide on the turns and was no factor. WASNT JOKING was away alertly and went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path,
set the pace through tepid fractions, was asked while inside on the far turn, lost the lead near the quarter-pole and capitulated. MEG AND CLAIR went five
wide on the first turn, was urged along well back on the outside, went two to three wide on the far turn and failed to respond.

HIGHLAND CREEK bumped with a rival at the start, went four then three wide on the first turn, contested the pace on the outside, vied two to three wide on
the far turn, shook clear at the quarter-pole, drew off into the final furlong and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. BALLINONABUDJET went
four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, dropped in near the
three-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. MR. UNIVERSE lunged outward at the start and was off slow, spotted the
front several lengths, went five to six wide on the turns, rallied outside in upper stretch, drifted in outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage
to just miss the place while able to get the show. YOUR TIME'S COMING went four wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace, was urged three wide on
the far turn, lacked room in traffic into upper stretch, found room around the three-sixteenths, steadied when MR. UNIVERSE drifted in front outside the
sixteenth-pole then moved out and finished willingly. KANSAS KING broke in and bumped with a foe, raced inside early on the first turn then shifted three
wide, settled near the middle of the field, jostled with a foe around the half-mile pole, was urged four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and
gained late but missed the superfecta. KAMARA VISION went around the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace, chased inside on the far turn, pursued
the leader under a drive into upper stretch, moved out in the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. A STAR IS BORN NOW went six wide on the first turn,
was rated on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn and tired. KASENS TRAIN went five wide early on the first turn then dropped to three wide,
settled off the pace, jostled with a foe while under urging around the half-mile pole then dropped in, saved ground on the far turn and failed to threaten.
GUILTY AS CHARGED lugged out three wide into the first turn then dropped to the rail, contested the pace, vied inside under urging on the far turn and
gave way. WILLIAMS SHINE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced inside to the two path on the turns, angled out significantly in upper
stretch and was no factor. ONE CAR FUNERAL was off slow then checked sharply to avoid the fallen rider, went three wide on the turns and never reached
contention. CAPTAIN ZIGGY bolted to the outside fence on the first turn and was eased but walked off. JUSTIN'SMEMORIES was bumped at the start then
bobbled hard and unseated the rider. (Rail at 7 Feet) SEVEN-EIGHTHS FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

VERIFIED showed good speed and set the clear pace, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch and
held under strong urging. ANOTHER HERO bumped with a rival after the start, was coaxed along off the pace, came under stronger encouragement while
three to four wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly to just get the place. GOLD DOUBLE was forced out at
the start, established a good position just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused in the three path into the stretch, pursued the winner in the
drive and finished with good courage to just miss the place while well clear for the show. GRAVES MILL ROAD was urged along on the outside, dropped
back five to six wide on the turn and failed to threaten. SCHMOOZIN bumped hard with foes on both sides after the start, tracked the pace, chased four
wide on the turn and came up empty. CONFESS bumped with a rival after the start, drifted out badly at the five-eighths then dropped back, went four to five
wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. WINDCHILL ZAR came outward at the start, chased the pace, raced in the three path on
the turn and retreated.

the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside and closed strongly to get up late. CARAMEL ANGEL went three then two wide on the first
turn, set the pace, vied inside on the far turn, lost the lead into upper stretch, fought on gamely into the final furlong, regained the lead coming to the
sixteenth-pole but was caught while able to get the place. COPPER FIDDLE went four wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the outside,
ranged up three wide on the far turn, took the lead into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong, lost the advantage nearing the sixteenth-pole
and was outfinished while just able to get the show. COMEDIAN restless in the gate, was hard held while keen into the first turn, went three wide on that
bend, was reserved towards the back, went four wide under urging on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved position. CHA VEZ went four
wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, drafted in the two path under restraint on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a
drive in upper stretch, chased into the final sixteenth, steadied off heels late and missed the superfecta. NEW EAGLE settled on the inside, was roused on
the far turn, swung out into upper stretch and finished willingly but missed the superfecta. MOM SAID YES went four wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, traveled around the far turn in the two path, came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. SIMPLY went five wide on the
first turn, settled well back in the field, went three then four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

reserved off the pace, went around the far turn in the two path, was asked for his best in upper stretch and failed to rally. MORHAWK was taken in hand
early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole and came up

Footnotes
ELUSIVE D'ORO settled off the pace, moved closer in the two path on the turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, made a bid between horses at the
three-sixteenths then took the advantage, kicked clear outside the furlong marker and drew away under steady urging. ON YOUR MARK raced well back in
the field, went around the turn in the two path then came three wide into the stretch, angled out near the three-sixteenths and finished willingly for the place.
SMART CALL was hard ridden on the inside, drafted inside on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, lacked sufficient room while trying to squeeze
through a tight rail opening in upper stretch, found clear space before the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick while just up for the show. GALLANT
PLUNGER settled off the pace, chased three then four wide on the turn, made a five wide bid at the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened then lost the show. FIRST CONTACT showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped
back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. OSO NEGRO broke a bit slow then was taken up, raced at the rear, went around the turn in the two path,
moved out near the sixteenth-pole then drifted out and was no factor. HAMAZING WISDOM settled under some urging, went three wide early on the turn
then dropped to the rail, shifted three wide into the stretch and also was no factor. JAZZ IT UP disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on
the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated. CAN IMAGINE was fractious in the gate, broke awkwardly and was off slow, moved out near the
half-mile pole, went three then four wide on the turn and failed to respond. TWILIGHT FANTASY chased the pace on the outside, went four to five wide on
the turn, dropped back six wide into the stretch and faded.

while able to get the show. CATINANDSCATIN dropped back at the start, settled well off the pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, dropped back
leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, bumped with a rival at the five-sixteenths and improved position. NOSY BANKER pressed the pace on
the outside of the leader, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. WICKED ALEX settled towards
the rear, was urged while inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, bumped with a foe at the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response.
