MACHISMO stalked the pace into the turn, rallied three wide to make the lead before the quarter pole, set the balance of the pace and proved best under a
strong hand ride. MORE THAN GOOD never far back, had a mild late rally three wide and finished second best. HE'S NO BULL pressed the pace into the
turn, loomed boldly between horses two wide, battled until deep stretch and was outfinished in the final yards. DR. ZARNETT trailed into the stretch and
closed ground late two wide. STORM ADVISORY well placed, failed to respond. SMOKIN NITRO broke in front, set the pace along the inside through the
turn then gave way.

Footnotes
ZEKE THE STREAK broke in full stride to set all the pace and maintained his advantage under right handed urging. POZNAN never far back, advanced in
the five path into the stretch and finished clearly second best. BLAZING DESIRE pressed the pace three wide into the stretch then was outfinished. NETAS
failed to menace. LOVEATTURKEYCLUB was bumped at the start, trailed until deep stretch then passed tiring rivals. I AM IRON MAN also bumped at the
start, was no factor. ELI'S COMING had brief speed. MR. TOP FLEET bore in at the start bumping rivals, stumbled and was through after a half. TEMPLE
MOUNT pressed the pace from the inside and was through early.

Footnotes
MAXIMIZER made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and prevailed under left handed urging. PICKFORD pressured the winner two and three
wide and just missed in a determined effort. WINCREDIBLE STAR allowed to settle, was gaining ground late in the four path. EVEN KEELED stalked the
pace along the rail, loomed boldly near the quarter pole, kept pressure until deep stretch then weakened and jumped tracks near the wire. HEZA HANDFUL
well placed, offered a mild bid into the stretch then came up empty. OAKS HONEY was outrun. DOT'S VISION had speed for a half then wilted. DEER
CREEK ROAD was bounced around between horses and squeezed entering the first turn then trailed.

KING DADDIO had speed from the start, waited behind a wall of horses through the turn and into the stretch, bulled his way through three wide past the
furlong marker and won under strong handling. TEAM RIBOT disputed the pace four wide and gained second by the narrowest of margins. LOCK ON
matched strides for the lead three wide and finished with good courage. ASTRO JAK made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace until deep
stretch then was outfinished. AWESOME SIGHT stalked the pace five wide into the stretch and faded late. PAXOS failed to menace. WILLY I AM with the
second flight inside, lacked the needed response. KEYED ON TOP battled for the lead two wide into the stretch then weakened. SALT MINE was no threat.

Footnotes
IRISH THUNDER never far back, closed willingly in the five path through the stretch under right handed urging and got up in the final strides. MOR BREEZE
broke in front, set all the pace and just missed handing on. MISS ROSS unhurried early, circled rivals outside on the far turn then leveled off. LET'S GO
LUNA chased the pace into the stretch then weakened. STRIKING RED broke awkwardly then failed to menace. MS FIFTH AVENUE passed tiring rivals.
WROTE'S GIFT was through after a half. YOURS TRULY moved up two wide before a half then came up empty. BETTER VIBES had brief speed.
