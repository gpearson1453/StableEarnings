FLASH IT broke outwards bumping JUST LIKE DUNCAN, was quickly righted to gain terms with the pacesetter prompting the pace between foes, pressed
the issue on the turn to gain the advantage nearing upper stretch, went clear along the inside, then shifted out under left handed pressure nearing the wire
to make some contact with JUSTLYREWARDED but held that foe to the end. The latter tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, angled
to the inside entering the turn, shifted out splitting foes entering the lane to advance on the leader, the was bumped by that foe nearing the wire while failing
to gain even terms. SILVER CONNECTION, forwardly placed three deep in the opening stages, was urged to press the issue between foes in that path on
the turn, couldn't match terms with the top pair but edged rivals for a share. TOMMY TUESDAY angled to the rail in early stages dropping off the second
flight, shifted out entering the lane and gained some position between foes. STERLING ICE, urged to the lead along the inside from the break, dueled for
command racing into the turn and gave way in the drive. THREE HOMBRES tracked off the first flight four wide in the opening quarter, advanced to lodge a
brief bid in that path on the turn but flattened out in upper stretch. MORO DRAMA settled between foes in the last flight early and failed to menace
thereafter. JUST LIKE DUNCAN, off a step slowly, then bumped at the start, trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF JUSTLY
REWARDED LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
CAMPAIGN SPY, in touch with the leaders three deep attending the pace under light reserve racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue in that path
leaving the far turn, shifted inwards entering the stretch while gaining the advantage and narrowly prevailed under firm handling. OUT OF PATIENCE was
urged to the lead along the rail racing to the first turn dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, dueled for command after a half inside foes to the second
bend and grudgingly resisted the winner to the end. GRIMGRINNIN' GHOST tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out
four wide nearing the lane and continued with an effort to close the gap on the top pair. PAINTER'S PRIDE angled to the inside tracking off the first flight
racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, shifted out midstretch but faded late. WILD ABOUT YOU settled last racing to the backstretch
and failed to menace. J S BACH, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
RICOCHET broke readily to gain a position racing just off the pacesetter attending that rival's tempo under light rating to the backstretch, steadily moved to
terms nearing the second bend on his own courage, pressed the issue midway through the far turn to go clear racing into upper stretch under pressure, then
was taken in hand nearing the wire once the issue was decided. LAST INVESTMENT angled inwards in the opening stages to take up a position between
foes in second flight, was firmly rated between foes to the far turn, shifted outwards racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for
the place honors. DREAMING OF GERRY broke outwards brushing NEW DAWN at the start, was urged to the lead along the rail while a bit rank against
restraint racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, dueled inside the eventual winner on the far turn and gave
way in the drive. NEW DAWN, brushed at the start, was slow to gather stride, settled last to the far turn and passed only tiring rivals. WILTON tracked off
the first flight three depe racing to the backstretch, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and came up empty in the drive. FIGHTING HEART angled to
the inside tracking off the first flight in the opening half, was prompted to make brief progress inside foes nearing the far turn but quickly emptied out nearing
upper stretch.

Footnotes
HOLY DIVER came under brisk pressure in the opening stages to gain terms with the pacesetter, prompted that rival into the turn, was fanned four wide in
upper stretch but continued with a steady effort to late stages to narrowly prevail under firm encouragement. POSTINO'S CHAMPION angled inwards to
track off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, split rivals just off the inside to bid inside the pacesetter midstretch and just missed. ANIMAUXSELLE,
off last, settled three deep between foes, split foes rivals nearing upper stretch, then angled five wide entering the lane and continued willingly to close the
gap while prevailing for a share. APRIL FOG sped to the lead from the break racing a bit off the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the turn, dueled
inside the eventual winner while shifting to the three path in upper stretch and just failed to sustain that momentum in the final furlong while being taken in
hand at the wire. BABIE MONSTER angled to the inside in early tracking just off the first flight, saved ground on the turn, then bid inside the leaders in
tandem with several rivals entering upper stretch but was outkicked. TURING MACHINE tracked off the second flight along the inside and continued evenly
inside rivals late. EXTRA GORGEOUS settled between foes in the last flight early and failed to menace. QUIET NO MORE tracked off the first flight racing
four wide to the turn, was fanned five wide nearing upper stretch and soon gave way. J'S TWOSTEP BEAUTY, forwardly placed three deep prompting the
pace through the backstretch, gave way nearing upper stretch.

PRIZED WARRIOR broke readily to dispute the lead inside foes racing to the backstretch, dueled into the far turn, kicked clear while angling in nearing
upper stretch, shifted out under left handed pressure in late stages furlong but held WICKED STRONG ALEX on a narrow margin to the end under firm
handling. The latter tracked the leaders three deep in second flight racing to the far turn, angled inwards nearing upper stretch advancing to contention just
outside the eventual winner, altered course to challenge inside that foe leaving the sixteenth marker but was outkicked. TALON joined the pace three wide
in the opening stages, shifted inwards midway through the backstretch pressing the issue, dueled through the far turn to upper stretch but weakened late.
IRISH MAIL tracked off the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into the lane and continued with an effort to improve position.
PAPA RALPH J, urged between foes prompting the pace into the first turn, was held up, then shifted three deep midway through the backstretch, continued
in brief pursuit to the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. DR. SAMADI dropped well off the field racing to the backstretch and failed to menace
thereafter. IGOTSUNSHINE broke a bit awkwardly, was settled along the inside to the backstretch but offered no rally. HE HAD A SECRET tracked the
leaders inside foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, made steady progress racing into the far turn but quickly came up empty nearing upper stretch.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF WICKED STRONG ALEX LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH

CLASSY WOMAN broke readily to gain a position stalking just outside the pacesetter under light reserve racing to the backstretch, prompted that foe racing
into the far turn, moved to challenge entering upper stretch, was carried out in the closing stages but wrested the advantage in time under firm handling.
BACI sped to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, was urged to maintain the advantage
racing into upper stretch, drifted out in the last furlong while resisting the winner's bid but couldn't contain that foe. CHICK'S SHADOW tracked just off the
pacesetter along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, angled out racing into the stretch and was floated to the five path in the
closing stages while moving to close the gap. PLAYIN DISCO, held up just off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground
on the far turn gaining some position, then angled to the five path in late while finishing evenly. TWILA MAE tracked off the second flight between foes
racing to the first turn, was urged to advance three deep between foes after a half, was fanned six wide into the lane and had no final response. RED
CURLS was settled last along the inside in the opening half, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. JUST A BIT SASSY tracked just off the
first flight three wide in the opening half but retreated early. QUEEN FIELD, caught in tight quarters at the start, switched outside foes to race four wide
through the first turn, continued widest through the backstretch and emptied out racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
D'URBAN PARK raced unhurried dropping off the second flight in the opening stages, angled to the rail nearing the turn, steadily gathered momentum after
a half, shifted out three wide in upper stretch to split foes and wrested the advantage in time under firm handling. DOUBLE DEEP, urged inside foes
disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, dueled past midstretch gaining a narrow advantage but was collared nearing the wire. PURIMETER
was rated off the first flight in the opening three furlong, steadily advanced four wide on the turn to upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair.
GETTININTOMISCHIEF joined the pace three wide in the opening quarter, shifted inwards nearing the lane pressing the issue between foes but weakened
nearing the wire. HARD WEST settled outside a rival in the last flight on the backstretch, raced five wide into the turn while being prompted to advance and
continued to improve position in that path late. TWIN VALOR, held up when shuffled out of tight quarters at the start, shifted three wide into the turn gaining
position between foes, angled to the rail racing into upper stretch, then was taken in hand when lacking a path in the final sixteenth. COMBAT
CONTROLLER, urged between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way nearing the lane. FOURTH DESIGN tracked off the
first flight five wide in the opening quarter but dropped out nearing the turn. AQUAMARINE tracked off the second flight while angling to the rail in the
opening stages but retreated early.

Footnotes
SETHAMEE STREET was settled last near the inside in the opening quarter, swung out six wide entering the stretch, then produced a stout rally to wrest
the advantage and go clear in time under firm handling. BUCKY'S DRAMA broke readily, angled inwards forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the turn,
shifted to the rail once gaining the advantage leaving the turn, went clear into upper stretch but was collared late. BONITA ANNIE, bumped at the start, was
righted to track off the first flight racing four wide into the turn, advanced in that path to challenge nearing the lane but continued evenly in late stages.
THINKIN COWTOWN broke outwards bumping BONITA ANNIE, was settled off the second flight racing to the turn, angled five wide entering the lane and
finished with interest while missing for a share. ALEXANDRA KAY was rated off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn, steadied leaving the
midway point of the turn avoiding some traffic, shifted out racing into the lane but offered no rally. BAND SWEETHEART tracked just off the first flight three
wide racing to the turn, briefly gained on the pacesetter between foes in that path nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. SOME SAY SO was
hustled up the rail disputing the pace, was taken up when racing in tight quarters entering the turn, steadied repeatedly nearing upper stretch and gave way
in the drive.

Footnotes
FOXGLOVE tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half while under light reserve, shifted out three deep on the far turn while advancing
on the leaders, was fanned four deep entering the lane but produced a steady late response to wrest command and go clear under firm encouragement.
DREAMER'S GETAWAY, off last, was settled outside foes to the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued willingly between
foes to prevail for the place honors. SUNNYMEDE DREAM angled to the rail early tracking just off pacesetter racing to the far turn, shifted out in upper
stretch and continued in close quarters between foes to gain even terms with a rival for a share. MOMS LOVE settled off the second flight outside foes
racing to the backstretch, was prompted to make a sharp advance four wide racing into the far turn to gain terms with the leaders nearing upper stretch,
pressed the issue between foes three deep in the lane and just lasted for a share. GET BACK HOME settled near the inside in early stages, angled out five
wide racing through the far turn and continued in that path to improve position. HEPZIBAH was rated off the second flight along the inside, saved ground
through the far turn, gained some position inside foes entering upper stretch, was caught in close quarters late and had no final response. CLOVER BEACH
tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening half and came up empty racing through the far turn. CANTERBURY GOLD pulled her way to the
lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second bend, faded entering upper stretch, then was taken up avoiding tight quarters
leaving the sixteenth marker. TOO MUCH SMOKE, urged to gain a position three deep in the second flight, was urged to make a brief bid between foes on
the far turn but came up empty entering the lane. MEANASASNAKE was urged to gain a forward placing between foes prompting the pacesetter in the
opening half but gave way abruptly racing into the second bend.
