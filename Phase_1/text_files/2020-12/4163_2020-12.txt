Footnotes
R MARIE led the field from the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and dug in gamely in the stretch to hold her lead to the wire. MORA
VALLEY was reluctant to load, stalked the leader on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and chased the winner
home to finish well. ORDAINED KISS raced off the pace early, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid approaching the three sixteenths pole
and gained ground quickly on the outside in late stretch. TINDERELLA brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the
pack up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and improved position in the stretch. DUSTY MILLER hit the
gate and then bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, recovered to run in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, raced in the two path around
the turn and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. LADY EXPRESS raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile,
saved ground around the turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. HEY HEY chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the turn and faded in the stretch. LEISHLANICK brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to settle just off the pace for the run
up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and weakened from there. VEGAN GOES BEST veered out slightly leaving the gate, was straightened out
and pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch and into the turn, entered the stretch in the three path and tired from there. CHLOBEE bumped with
the horse to her outside and was squeezed back at the break, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, drifted out extremely wide around the turn
and finished in the middle of the track while never being a factor.

Footnotes
ANDREAS set the pace inside, took pressure from ZANFORCE from the thirteen sixteenths to the eleven sixteenths, cleared again, continued on a clear
pace while saving ground through the far turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, drifted out despite right handed urging, and held. BEHIND ENEMY LINES
tracked the leading pair inside of MUSIAL early, settled behind that foe for the backstretch run, kept tabs on the leading pair while driven in the two path on
the turn, swung out to the six path for the stretch run, rallied under a drive, and just missed. ZANFORCE tracked the leader early, advanced to press outside
him from the thirteen sixteenths to the eleven sixteenths, settled back to track him for the rest of the backstretch run, continued to track in the three path on
the turn, proved no match for the pacesetter into the lane, but kept on best of the rest. SATURDAYS HANGOVER settled in second last, inched forward to
chase inside of HIDE THE EVIDENCE into the backstretch, inched up to midfield past the five eighths, chased in the two path on the far turn, was driven for
a rally in the three to four path in upper stretch, improved mildly, flattened out late but held a minor award. SWITHERAL settled at the rear, improved
position in the four to five path on the far turn, and ran evenly under a drive in the seven path in the lane. HIDE THE EVIDENCE chased midpack early,
settled back second last past the five eighths, was outpaced in the four path on the far turn and had no rally in the lane. MUSIAL tracked the leading pair
outside of BEHIND ENEMY LINES on the clubhouse turn, continued in range down the backstretch, began to weaken under a drive in the four path on the
far turn, and proved empty in the lane.

Footnotes
FIXICO was sent for speed, set a pressured pace early, cleared approaching the turn, raced in the two path around the bend, and remained well clear
toward the inside down the lane while kept to the task. LASTFORTINOFAMILY tracked the leading trio, was urged in the four path on the turn, went to a
drive between horses in the lane, and was urged in measured fashion while still between horses to get up for the place late. DEORA STORE tracked the
leading pair outside of MOON FLASH early, tracked the pacesetter in the three path on the turn, went to a drive two wide in upper stretch, proved no match
for the leader, and lost the place inside of LASTFORTINOFAMILY late. COCO BRAVADO chased midpack down the backstretch and in the five path on the
turn, was driven in the six path in upper stretch, ran on with continued interest but was ultimately outfinished for the place outside of LASTFORTINOFAMILY
and DEORA STORE. EDISON FIRE settled at the rear, raced in the seven path on the turn, swung out to the eight to nine path in upper stretch, and rallied
mildly under a drive. BIRD KEY settled in second last, angled out three deep into the turn, improved between horses in the four path on the turn, went to a
drive in the four to five path in upper stretch, was outpaced by the leading group into the lane, and weakened. COLIDA chased midpack, was pushed along
in the six path on the turn, and had no kick while still in the six path in the lane. A HINT OF GRAY grazed the gate on the way out, settled near the rear
outside early, came in approaching the three eighths, continued near the rear in the two to three path around the rest of the bend, and had no rally in the
lane. MOON FLASH prompted inside of FIXICO early, tracked behind him from the half, lost position while saving ground through the turn, and was no
further factor in the lane. FELIXNITETRAINCOLE settled near the rear, steadied approaching the three eighths when put in tight between A HINT OF GRAY
and the rail, and weakened.

backstretch, continued to race off the pace on the inside, started to move up from the three path around the turn, dueled for the lead down the lane and
eventually got up for the win while drifting out mildly in the final sixteenth. Z U SOON bore in and bumped with TRES GENERACIONES headed into the first
turn, dueled for the lead from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved into save ground around the far turn and dueled gamely down
the stretch, giving way late. ROAR OF THE LION trailed the field while saving ground through the opening half mile, began to move up from the rail around
the turn, swung out entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside in the final furlong while never threatening the top two. MAXIMUS IMAGE saved
ground around the first turn, pressed the pace from the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, dueled for the lead briefly in
upper stretch and weakened while drifting out in the final furlong. CONSPICUOUS BOX chased the leaders from the two path around the first turn and up
the backstretch, swung out to began a mild bid from the four path approaching the quarter pole and flattened out in the stretch. TORNADO BOY was
fractious in the gate, bobbled at the break, navigated the first turn from the three path, settled in between horses just behind the leaders for the run up the
backstretch, moved in to save ground around the far turn and had no kick. MAJESTIC HERO raced in the four path around the first turn, chased the
frontrunners on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and was empty from there. DRIVER DAN hit the gate and brushed
with the horse to his inside at the break, raced between the four and the five path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the
outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and was never involved. TRES GENERACIONES was bumped and forced to steady when Z U SOON bore
into his lane headed into the first turn, angled out to find room and press the pace from the two path through the next half mile, began to drop back while
racing in the two path around the far turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
FOLLOW THE SIGNS chased the leading pair early, tracked in the four path on the turn, turned for home in the four to five path, improved under a drive, got
on even terms with the leader past the furlong pole, and drove clear in the final sixteenth. WAKE UP JOE was placed on the lead, saved ground through the
turn, was confronted by HALO HUNTER near the three eighths, held that foe at bay, dug in when confronted by FOLLOW THE SIGNS approaching the
furlong mark, tried gamely but could not go with that foe in the final sixteenth. HALO HUNTER tracked outside of WAKE UP JOE down the backstretch and
into the turn, loomed past the three eighths, could not get past WAKE UP JOE, weakened in the final furlong but salvaged the show. NYOMAN settled
behind the chasing flight early, came in on ROAD GAME while advancing three wide between horses past the half mile mark, chased in the three path
around the bend, was driven in the five path in the lane, kept on with interest but missed the show. LONG STATION broke sharply, settled three wide to
chase the leading pair, continued to chase in the five path on the turn, and kept on in the six path in the lane while no match for the to four. LITTLE MIGHTY
MAN bobbled into stride, was taken to the rear, raced in the two to three path on the turn, and passed inside of tiring horses in the lane. PRESIDENT
ELECT settled in second last, raced in the five path on the turn, swung into the lane in the eight path, and had no rally under a drive. RIO SECO settled
outside of NYOMAN behind the chasing flight early, took closer order in the five to six path on the turn, and came up empty in the drive. ROAD GAME raced
between horses in the chasing flight early, checked hard past the half when NYOMAN came in, weakened in the two path on the turn and was empty for the
drive.

Footnotes
EXEMPLAR saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far turn from the two
path, launched a surging bid between horses with a furlong to go and dug in to pull clear in late stretch. PENALTY SHOT saved ground around the fist turn,
led the field under a hold up the backstretch, maintained his advantage while saving ground around the far turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was
caught in the final furlong while finishing well. RUFFOLO chased the leader from the two path through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around
the far turn, moved up to challenge entering the stretch and could not go with the winner but finished well, just missing second. LEMON BLITZ raced in the
three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, saved ground around the far turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and
was outkicked to the wire while finishing evenly. NOT VERY GENTLE trailed the field in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, inched up
on the field from the three path around the far turn, continued to gain ground mildly on the outside in the stretch, but was never a threat. COWBOYS
DREAM raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the
three path and faded in the final furlong. YOU SPLIT TENS raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in behind the leaders for the run up the
backstretch, began a bid from the three path approaching the three eighths pole and tired badly in the stretch.

Footnotes
VERRAZANO FIRST was placed on the lead, took mild early pressure from ARCHIEMYBOY, cleared in the two path on the turn, and was never challenged
in the lane while kept to the task. DEFENDER was anxious in the gate, settled toward the rear inside, improved position while hugging the rail on the turn,
got boxed in by traffic in upper stretch, split horses near the furlong mark, and got up for the place. ARCHIEMYBOY tracked outside of VERRAZANO FIRST
down the backstretch, was pushed along in the three path on the turn to try to keep up with the pacesetter, turned for home under a drive, kept on three
wide while no match for the winner, and lost the place late. GOING WITH STYLE settled three wide early, bid when urged in the five path on the turn, was
driven four wide into the lane, continued willingly but was outkicked for the place. ARRIVAL chased the leading trio two wide, continued to chase in the two
path on the turn, was driven in upper stretch, taken four wide near midstretch, and was outfinished. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER chased the leading trio inside
of ARRIVAL, bid along the rail around the turn, loomed inside in upper stretch, proved no match for VERRAZANO FIRST, and weakened in the final furlong.
IWILLPERSEVERE was slow into stride, settled along the rail, saved ground around the bend, began to rally mildly into the lane, angled out in midstretch,
and ran evenly late. WILD WES was anxious in the gate, stumbled in the opening strides, settled between horses, continued toward the rear in the three to
four path on the turn, was taken six wide under a drive in upper stretch, and mustered no rally. EXPROMPT (FR) settled in second last, raced two wide in
the rear flight on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, and offered no rally. COUSIN DARIO was reluctant to load, broke outward, tracked outside the
leading pair, raced in range in the four path on the turn, came into the lane three wide between horses and faded.

Footnotes
BODEMAX sprinted to the early lead, saved ground around the turn and extended his winning margin while being ridden out to the wire. WILDWOOD
MAGGIE raced at the back of the pack early, began a bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole and gained ground on the outside throughout
the stretch, the best of the rest. HENRYS GIRL chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, launched a bid
passing the three eighths pole and finished evenly while no match for the top two. LOGI settled on the inside in the middle of the pack for the run up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn, offered a mild bid entering the stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. TEMRIK hopped up slightly leaving
the gate, trailed the field on the outside through the opening three furlongs, began to move up from the two path around the turn and continued a mild gain
in late stretch. RARE ACTION ATTACK broke slowly, trailed the field on the inside through the opening half mile, raced in the two and three paths around
the turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. AMAZING ANNIE raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three
path and made no bid while racing between horses in the stretch. TALLY UP chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn,
entered the stretch from the three path and faded in the final furlong. POLAR'S GRACE stalked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, began to
drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and continued to tire from there. I SAW HER FIRST reared in the gate, hopped up at the actual break,
recovered to race in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch. OZETTE raced off the pace on the inside
early, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.
