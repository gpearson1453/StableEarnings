Footnotes
FLAMING INDY, forwardly placed along the rail in the opening stages, switched outside the leader racing into the turn while steadily moving to terms with
that rival, took over after a half and held sway on a clear margin to the end while under firm encouragement. DIVA DANA tracked just off the leaders in the
opening stages, shifted out three deep nearing the lane and proved best of the others. DON'T MAKE ME BEG broke slowly, tracked the leaders from out of
striking distance racing four wide into the turn, then continued in that path to improve her position while prevailing for a share. BONSAI BENNY was rated
near the rail in early stages, saved ground through the turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch and continued to make mild progress between foes late. LA
WAPA, unhurried three wide between foes racing to the turn, continued evenly in that path. LASTING JOY settled last on the backstretch, angled five wide
in upper stretch but failed to menace. MISS MARGARET ANN broke readily, was urged to gain the lead while angling to the inside in the opening quarter
but gave way after a half.

Footnotes
SMART WARRIOR was rated off the second flight while angling inwards racing through the backstretch into the turn, shifted out entering the lane, split foes
four wide leaving the furlong marker advancing on the leaders and narrowly prevailed in time under firm encouragement. FREE FLAYME broke readily to
gain the advantage just off the inside racing through the opening furlong, disputed the lead inside a rival into the turn, dueled for command past midstretch
but was collared nearing the wire. SOUR KICKS, urged forcing the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, dueled between foes to late
stages but was outkicked by the top pair. FIRST DEGREE tracked the leaders between foes in the second flight, shifted four wide entering the lane, was
fanned five wide leaving midstretch and lacked the needed final kick. DON H tracked off the first flight along the rail, saved ground through the turn to upper
stretch but faded late. SHAKEM N BREAKEM, slow into stride, tracked off the second flight outside a rival, angled out nearing the stretch but offered no
rally. SPINNING JOEY tracked the leaders three deep as part of the second flight racing into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. HACIENDA BLVD
was outpaced early.

advantage to the end under firm left handed encouragement. CARROBIO tracked the leaders three deep in the opening stages, dropped off the second

a rival for the place honors late. VILLAGE PREACHER tracked off the first flight inside the eventual winner racing to the turn, was steadied out of tight
quarters midway through the turn, shifted out to gain position three deep between foes in the final quarter but was outkicked by the top pair. DREAM

clear on the turn, held sway to midstretch but gave out in the last furlong. MONITOR MILLS broke slowly, was settled off the second flight well off the inside
early and offered no rally. ALKI BEACH was outpaced early. MEMOLOTSAMISCHIEF was urged to the lead inside foes in the opening furlong, shifted off
the rail dictating the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, bore out leaving the three furlong marker, was gathered up while losing contact with
the field nearing the stretch but walked off the course under his own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER AND THE TRAINER OF VILLAGE

Footnotes
JEHA, bumped at the start, was rated between foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide leaving the midway point of
the far turn while being prompted to challenge for command, wrested the advantage leaving midstretch and edged clear under firm left handed pressure.
VAN, unhurried outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled inwards after a half, was prompted to split foes just off the inside racing into
upper stretch to challenge inside the eventual winner leaving midstretch and continued willingly while failing to match that rival. MAGIC SOLUTION broke
outwards bumping the eventual winner, was reserved off the second flight along the inside racing into the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper
stretch and found his best stride late to close the gap while prevailing for a share. INDY LYON, forwardly placed stalking a rival's pace in the opening half,
advanced on that foe to press the issue on the far turn, dueled between foes into upper stretch and yielded late. PRIVATE CODE settled last racing to the
first turn, switched outside foes entering the backstretch gaining position, advanced four wide into upper stretch but was outkicked for a placing. MISSION
BRIEF, reserved well off the leaders along the inside racing to the far turn, was fanned six wide entering upper stretch and made some mild progress.
UNCLE CHARMING sped to the lead from the break, dictated the pace on a clear margin to the far turn, briefly dueled for command through the second
bend and gave way nearing midstretch. UNIDENTIFIED MAN tracked off the first flight, three, then four wide through the backstretch, continued three deep
into the far turn and faded into upper stretch. THE CAPTURED STAR angled to the inside early tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight and gave
way after a half.

Footnotes
CONSILIUM tracked off the second flight three wide in the opening stages, shifted to the four path on the turn while being prompted to advance, lost some
ground to SECRET MAGICIAN nearing upper stretch but continued with a steady late response to reel in that foe and wrest a narrow advantage in time
under a few left handed prompts and firm hand urging. The late tracked well off the first flight in the three path racing through the backstretch, steadily
gained on those rivals in that path on the turn, wrested the advantage to go clear late but couldn't fend off the winner. ELUSIVE ROAD settled inside foes
tracking off the second flight racing to the turn, shifted off the inside to gain position three deep between rivals in the lane and narrowly prevailed for a share.
LITTLE LATER switched to the outside in the opening quarter tracking off the second flight three deep between foes, was fanned four wide into the stretch
and continued with an effort to improve position between foes while missing for a share. STOPIT broke readily, disputed the pace inside a rival through the
backstretch into the turn and gave way into the lane. PACHI angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn and
emptied out once headed in upper stretch. WILD ENOUGH, reserved off the second flight racing four wide through the backstretch, was fanned five, then
six wide into the lane and failed to menace. NOBLE KING, unhurried inside foes in the second flight, dropped back after the opening quarter, swung out to
the eight path entering the lane but proved no threat. BIBLICAL QUOTES, off slowly, trailed throughout.

reserved off the second flight saving ground to the backstretch, shifted off the inside racing into the far turn, angled out five wide nearing upper stretch while
being prompted to advance between foes and edged a rival for a share while no match for the top pair. SKOL CHANT tracked the leaders four deep, then

ALWAYS SPECIAL, forwardly placed between rivals tracking just off the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, advanced on the turn to press the issue
into upper stretch and responded to firm left handed pressure to wrest a narrow advantage in time. GOOD BOY ROY broke sharply, angled to the rail
setting the pace on a comfortable advantage through the backstretch, grudgingly resisted the winner's bid racing through the stretch but came up second
best nearing the wire. BIZ NOW tracked the pacesetter within striking distance three deep between foes racing into the turn and continued willingly in that
path to close the gap mildly in late stages. ATWATER, bumped from both sides, then squeezed back at the start, was righted quickly to track off the first
flight three deep to the turn and continued evenly between foes in that path to improve position late. RIOJA PALACE broke inwards bumping ATWATER at
the start, was righted to gain a forward placing four deep tracking the pacesetter, advanced in that path on the turn to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch
but flattened out in the drive. BODACIOUS BLEND tracked off the first flight while angling to the inside racing into the turn and continued evenly late.
BEACH BANDIT broke out bumping ATWATER at the start, was collected to track off the first flight between foes racing to the turn but faded into upper
stretch. CHARGE INTO WAR proved no threat. HIPPIE COCO was outpaced early.

Footnotes
NICENO, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position inside foes nearing the far turn, came around a tiring rival on the far
turn to bid nearest the rail racing into upper stretch, shifted out under pressure in the closing stages but wrested a narrow advantage and held RED LIGHT
RACER to the end under brisk handling. The latter, reserved outside the eventual winner racing to the first turn, shifted out four wide on the backstretch
while being prompted to advance, moved to challenge for command three deep racing into upper stretch, was floated in late stages and couldn't quite match
the winner. SHEDANCESFORFATE tracked off the second flight near the inside in the opening half, tipped out entering the second bend advancing to
challenge, gained a narrow advantage holding sway just off the inside racing into upper stretch but proved no match for the top pair late. ECLECTIC SOUL
drifted out four wide racing through the first turn dropping off the second flight, angled to the inside nearing the far turn, then angled out to the four path
entering the lane to gain some position. CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE, off slowly, then bumped from both sides at the start, settled last to the backstretch and
passed inside some tiring rivals entering the lane. GAELIC TALES, broke out bumping JEANIE VEE, was righted to track off the second flight outside a rival
racing to the backstretch but steadily faded on the far turn. TWISTED TREASURE, pulled a bit in early stages tracking the pacesetter as part of the second
flight to the backstretch and emptied out racing into the far turn. FAIRY DIVA (GB) exchanged light contact at the start, was prompted to go well clear of the
field along the inside racing to the backstretch and gave out once headed entering the far turn. JEANIE VEE, bumped at the start, angled inside to track the
pacesetter as part of the second flight in the opening half but soon gave way.

MAKE A SCENE was prompted to a position racing just off the first flight between foes on the backstretch, came under some pressure to advance on the
turn, split foes just off the inside to bid inside the pacesetter nearing midstretch and kicked clear late under brisk right handed pressure. LADY
CLEMENTINE gained a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, readily advanced to press that rival entering the turn
to gain a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid past midstretch but couldn't contain that foe. EAST WING switched out four wide
early while being prompted to position in second flight nearing the turn, then continued in that path while finishing evenly in late stages while prevailing for a
share. MISS ALEX angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing into the turn, then angled out five wide in the closing stages while making some
belated progress. MOANAS POWER sped clear of the field leaving the chute while angling to the rail, set the pace to the turn, dueled for command inside a
rival on the bend to upper stretch and gave way late. RANSOMS REWARD angled to the inside in the opening quarter tracking the leaders as part of the
second flight but faded into upper stretch. MOLLIFY settled well off the leaders near the inside early and failed to menace. NABRUZZI proved no factor.
BETTY GRABLE tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the turn but soon dropped out.

Footnotes
FOX ROX tracked just off the leaders inside rivals in the opening quarter, advanced along the rail on the turn, shifted out three wide to bid for command
racing through the stretch and just edged FAIR CATCH on the wire under firm handling. The latter shifted inwards while being urged to terms prompting a
rival's pace racing into the turn, pressed the issue past midstretch to gain a narrow advantage between calls late and just missed. CHESS MASTER, urged
inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, dueled past midstretch but weakened nearing the wire. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE, restless in the
gate before the start, was off a step slowly, settled outside foes, then angled out five wide racing into the stretch to improve position late. HE'S SMOKIN
NOW tracked off the second flight while shifting inwards to split foes just off the inside racing into the turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch but had no final
kick. RATTLESNAKE RIDGE, urged to a forward placing between foes tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn, was fanned four wide into upper
stretch and gave way. SIMMARDSTRIKE tracked off the second flight between rivals in early stages, angled to the inside on the turn but lacked a rally.
WAPITI WAY tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn but offered no rally. WITHJUSTASPLASH dropped out early. IMA WILDCAT,
urged along three wide early pursuing the leaders as part of the second flight, emptied out racing into the turn.
