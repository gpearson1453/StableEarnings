Footnotes
CALL CURT set the pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the lane and held clear under a drive. SOUPER
ENERGIZER tracked the early pace two wide, bid three deep nearing the lane, was no match for the winner but in between rivals to secure the place.
GUNMAN was pushed inward at the start, raced off the pace three wide, came four wide into the lane and was one-paced late. TEMPLET stalked the pace
inside and finished evenly to just miss the minor awards. SHANANIES PAYNTER was firmly in hand inside through the opening half and lacked a rally.
FEELING DANGEROUS was bumped at the start, raced well back inside, swung widest in upper stretch and never threatened. JOE BENJAMIN broke
inwardly, pressed the pace outside of the winner and faded in the lane. GEORGIA PINES saved ground off the pace, was urged along down the
backstretch, went two wide around the far turn, swung five wide turning for home and lacked a bid. ELUSIVE JESTER was bumped at the start and was
always outrun while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
MIDTOWN ROSE vied early outside UNCAPTURED RUBY, got the best of that dispute on the turn while being overtaken by BACCARAT FASHION, got
joined from outside by IMA DAREDEVIL after a half-mile, exchanged brushes dueling with the latter through the lane and prevailed late. IMA DAREDEVIL
advanced to contention with ample room between BACCARAT FASHION and MIDTOWN ROSE late on the turn, lugged in brushing with the latter through
deep stretch, had to be pulled off and yielded through the closing yards. SENSE A MILLION saved ground outsprinted entering the turn, moved out three
wide approaching the stretch, and rallied mildly to best the remainder. SAYONARA BABY raced three then four wide around the turn, stayed on her left lead
through the drive and gained some ground without threatening. WORTH AVENUE was a step slow from the gate, trailed for a half-mile, advanced through
upper stretch and ran on evenly inside. BACCARAT FASHION tracked outside the early leaders, took over and went clear coming to the five-sixteenths,
commenced bearing out several paths shortly thereafter and dropped back into the stretch. UNCAPTURED RUBY dueled early inside MIDTOWN ROSE,
and folded up on the turn.

APACHE tracked the pace two wide, angled out in upper stretch, bumped with FIVE OF HEARTS near the three-sixteenths pole, closed between rivals,
took the lead near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under right-handed urging. FIVE OF HEARTS stalked the pace three wide, bumped with the winner
in upper stretch, battled on four wide and was second best late. GEMO pressed the pace two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, battled between to
the sixteenth marker and was outfinished. DREAM D'ORO set the pace along the rail to the sixteenth pole and weakened. ROAD TO PEACE lagged well
back inside, swung widest in upper stretch and narrowed the gap while still trailing. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUN
THROUGH THE STRETCH BUT FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
THISSMYTIME grabbed the early lead inside, shook off CHOOSE JOY and SKY CHASER around the turn, drifted out under left-hand pressure in deep
stretch and remained clear. MOVIE MOXY was taken widest leaving the chute, advanced four wide after six furlongs, had aim outside the winner but could
not reach her while drifting out. MAEDEAN was outsprinted to the stretch, rallied mildly between tired horses a sixteenth out and was along for the show.
VICTORY CRUSADE saved ground outrun to the turn, moved out three wide nearing the stretch, and made no headway through the last eighth of a mile.
SKY CHASER broke out hitting the right side of the gate, pursued the eventual winner three wide to the stretch, and tired. CHOOSE JOY pressed
THISISMYTIME two wide to the end of the turn, and gave way.

Footnotes
CAMELLIA GAL broke awkwardly, rushed up to clear nearing the first turn, set the pace along the rail, dug in gamely and lasted. SHE FLED THE SCENE
raced off the pace two wide, made a four wide move around the far turn to reach second in upper stretch, drifted out in midstretch, straightened out soon
after, switched back to the left lead near the sixteenth marker, rallied between and missed. MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT steadied off heels early, raced well back
inside, swung four wide near the five-sixteenths pole, closed widest and was finishing fastest of all. TRISH THE DISH tracked the pace four wide around the
first turn, chased three deep rounding the far turn and was one-paced through the stretch. TAILADIOS was in range inside and lacked a rally. MERCY
MERCY pressed the winner three wide around the first turn, two wide around the far turn and weakened in the drive. NOBLE MARIA failed to menace while
racing two wide around the turns and swinging out in upper stretch. ROONEY was outrun inside. TRUE ATKA played no factor while saving ground early
and going three wide around the far turn.

Footnotes
INFATUATING bumped with NAVAL WAVE at the start, tracked outside the early leaders, took over with a four-wide run coming to the quarter-pole, drew
clear through upper stretch, drifted out and was geared down the last 70 yards. STARSHIP NEBULA pressed the pace between horses, could not match
strides with the winner turning for home, and ran on to hold the place. NAVAL WAVE bumped with INFATUATING at the start, contested the pace between
horses into the turn, battled inside STARSHIP NEBULA through the lane and was edged for the runner-up spot while best of the remainder. MANUELA
advanced two wide after a half-mile, moved inside for the drive and made no further gains on her left lead. STEPPING FORWARD was no factor two then
three wide. PISCES was outsprinted to the stretch, and passed tired horses. RUBYSA was no factor inside. SERENGETI SUNSHINE raced three then four
wide around the turn, and tired into the stretch. MALICIOSA raced two to three wide, and was never in contention. GONE DREAMING set a pressured early
pace inside rivals, and gave way on the turn. POTTSYLVANIA lost contact with the field early, and jogged in far behind.

Footnotes
JABUTICABA set the pace along the rail, drifted out under incessant left-handed urging leaving the eighth pole, forcing out ZODIAC PRINCESS, angled
back in soon after, drifted out again late and lasted. ZODIAC PRINCESS prompted the pace two wide, was forced out leaving the eighth pole, switched back
to the left lead in the process, continued on gamely to narrow most the gap late. VITAEMI saved ground in midpack, went two wide around the far turn,
angled four wide in upper stretch and rallied between rivals. ROSA STAR was in range inside, had a bid in midstretch but was outkicked. MISS JEN saved
ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn, swung wider in upper stretch and rallied outside. LUCY'S TOWN was forced out at the start,
checked nearing the first turn, trailed inside for six furlongs, rallied strongly between rivals through the lane and checked when running up on heels nearing
the wire. JOST SAYIN saved ground off the pace and rallied belatedly inside. CHARGE ACCOUNT raced well back two wide, angled widest in upper stretch
and showed some late interest. MARIES MELODY broke outwardly, raced three wide around both turns and lacked a rally. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND
AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF ZODIAC PRINCESS, JABUTICABA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
BLESSED JOURNEY stayed close early outside, joined the leaders with a three-wide run soon after completing a half-mile, took over into the stretch, and
was driving to 70 yards out before being wrapped up. TAAMER set a pressured pace inside, could not resist the winner turning for home, but ran on with
good courage to hold second. HANDSOME PRINCE shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, and lacked a solid closing response. FRIENDLY FELLA
pressed the pace outside TAAMER, challenged for command between that one and BLESSED JOURNEY midway on the turn, then gave way through the
stretch on his left lead. MOON PISTOL raced three wide pursuing the early leaders, and gave way around the turn. SAINT BENEVOLENCE broke two
lengths behind the field, and was outrun inside. CAPTAIN D was outsprinted early inside, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and came up empty.

RICHIES GREAT GIRL saved ground in midpack, angled out in midstretch, brushed DOUBLE MEDAL near the sixteenth pole, closed between foes and
was up on the wire. WAR STAR was forced to check off heels entering the turn, chased two wide around the bend, took the lead leaving the eighth pole and
led until the final stride. DOUBLE MEDAL advanced four wide around the turn, was brushed near the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. BRIGHT
VENEZUELAN saved ground off the pace and rallied through the lane. GOT GLEE vied inside of SWEETHEART DEAL down the backstretch, inherited a
clear lead when that foe bore out early on the turn, led past the eighth pole and weakened. SONG RIVER was bumped at the start, showed speed three
wide, was taken at least eight wide by a bearing out rival early on the turn, extricated from that position and angled to the four path nearing the lane and still
had a bit of a rally outside. TRUE HEIRESS was bumped at the start, raced two wide and played no further factor. FOLLOW ME MOM advanced three wide
around the turn to reach contention but came up empty in the lane. SPEED STAR was outrun inside. SWEETHEART DEAL led early, bore out entering the

Footnotes
DEALER'S GIRL dashed clear early inside, set a sharp pace and responded late to hold off SWEETLY MAID. The latter bumped with SUBSIDIARY at the
start, settled in the middle of the field two wide early, moved out for the drive and rallied with good energy outside. MISS MIAMI pursued outside DEALER'S
GIRL to the stretch, and was outfinished for second. DANCING DOLL saved ground behind the leaders for three furlongs, and finished evenly in the
two-path. DAHLONEGA bumped with I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT at the start, lagged well back three wide to the stretch, and gained without menacing. I'M
PRAYINGFORTHAT bumped with DAHLONEGA at the start, and was no factor three wide. DIXIE PRINCESS was no factor inside. NOTHINS FREE was
outrun inside. PROSPECTIVE DIVA broke a couple lengths slow, and was never close. SUBSIDIARY bumped with SWEETLY MAID at the start, showed
speed three wide to the quarter-pole, and gave way.
