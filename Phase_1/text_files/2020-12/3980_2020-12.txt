Footnotes
LORELEI'S WARRIOR was void of any early speed, loomed seven wide through the second turn, took control at the eighth pole, drifted in and was best.
MO CERVEZA set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail, lost the lead into the home turn, re-rallied and finished second best. TOSS THE FLAG tracked
the early pace from between rivals and was empty late. ESTEEMED was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside into the home turn and never fired.
GO TOWER GO raced in mid pack early, advanced six wide into the second turn and offered no rally. BINGHAM'S FLASH pressed the early pace, went five
wide into the second turn and tired. PAIN FOR GAIN stalked the early pace from the inside and faded. WAGON A FIRE was outrun early, was eased and
vanned off. THE RIDER OF NUMBER SEVEN CALLED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE NUMBER ONE IN LATE STRETCH BUT NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.
