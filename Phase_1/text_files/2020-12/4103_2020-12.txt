Footnotes
SELL BABY SELL stalked the early pace from the inside, angled out and was up in time. IROQUOIS HEART set a pressured early pace from between
rivals, angled in and tired. GOOD FOR NOW tracked the early pace, went six wide into the turn, took a brief lead and was empty late. ROYAL QUEEN was
reserved, angled out in early stretch and finished with a mild rally. CONNIE'S LINDA was unhurried early, raced between rivals and finished belatedly.
TSURUOKA was not far back early, went six wide and flattened out. ISLE BE GABBY was taken back early, raced between rivals and never fired. RAMA
WHO was void of speed, raced along the inside and passed tired rivals. NAVARONES LEGEND was never a factor. BETWEEN THE BUOYS was reserved
early, went seven wide and weakened. TOWER WAGON was allowed to settle early, went four wide into the turn and gave way. COWGIRL DOM pressed
the early pace, went six wide and faded.
