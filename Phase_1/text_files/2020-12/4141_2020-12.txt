threat. DANCING WILLARD was unhurried early and passed tiring rivals. ROLLIN MY OWN contended until the top of the stretch, then gave way. BOOT
LEGGER raced mid pack and was no threat. CELTIC LINE wide early, was no menace. CAPTAIN RILEY was never far back and gave way on the far turn.
EIGHTTHEHARDWAY was well placed on the inside and dropped back after five eights.
