Footnotes
ASPEN ROSE stalked the early pace, made a strong move around the far turn, raced four wide into the upper stretch, gained command nearing the eighth
pole and prevailed late under strong encouragement. PROMENADE PRINCESS was allowed to settle early, moved up five wide at the quarter pole and
closed in willingly on the leader late to just miss. WORSTBESTIDEAEVER was slow in the early stages, raced six deep in the drive and showed good late
interest. ELOQUENT LADY was unhurried early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. SEVILLA SANGRIA pressed the early leader
while racing two wide and gave way the final quarter of a mile. ALPHARDINI stalked the early pace, raced towards the inside around the turn through the
stretch and failed to sustain a bid. MS. HAITI was a bit fractious behind the starting gate, set all the pace along the inside and tired readily in the drive.

Footnotes
TRIPLE TITOS was quick to begin from the inside to set all the pace and held gamely in the drive under strong handling. PORTAL ONE stalked the the top
pair early on, moved up two wide in the lane and could not get by the leader to be clearly second best. SWING YOUR SWORD was forwardly placed, racing
outside a rival, shifted out and raced four wide in upper stretch then continued on with effort while unable to threaten the top pair. UNCLE CECIL stalked the
pace, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no late response. LUCIAN settled off the early pace, raced four wide past the
eighth pole and had no late rally. KID CAN RUN dropped back early, saved ground and never threatened. COUNT THE SHELLS raced five deep into the
lane and never was a serious threat. DON'T THROW STONES was slow early, raced far back and never was involved.

ADHWAA stalked the early pace, moved up along the inside around the far turn, raced in the three path through the stretch, challenged the leader nearing
the eighth pole and got up in his final strides under strong handling in a determined effort. BOURBON WILDCAT was quick to begin to set all the pace, dug
in at the sixteenth pole and just missed in a game effort. GIMME'S GOLDENGIRL settled off the early pace, raced five wide just past the eighth pole and
showed good late interest. GOLD FINCH was unhurried early, saved ground through the far turn into the stretch and had no late response. HOT TO PARTY
dropped back early, raced four wide in the stretch and failed to respond. MISS OLD BAY pressed the early leader, raced four deep at the quarter pole and
faded. LUCETTA'S ON FIRE stalked the pace from the outside, raced five wide into the upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MY GOOD MAN stalked the early pace, raced three wide into the upper stretch, came out to the six path under left handed urging, drifted back in deep
stretch, bothered Automate while bumping rival. A jockey objection was filed by Automate and stewards ruled My Good Man to be disqualified for
interference in the stretch run and placed second. AUTOMATE was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide in the stretch, was bumped, bothered deep
stretch and finished gamely to the wire. BELLARMINE HALL set all the pace from the inside, was checked sharply deep stretch and finished willingly to the
wire. JAMMIN STILL went to his nose at the break, settled off the early pace, checked nearing the three eighths pole, raced towards the inside around the
far turn through the stretch and had not enough late. ENGLISH TAVERN dropped back early and failed to have a response. AMEN CORNER was allowed
to settle early, raced six deep into the upper stretch and never threatened. TEAM EFFORT pressed the early pace, faded in the stretch, lost his iron nearing
the sixteenth pole and unseated his rider.

Footnotes
ALWAYS FORGIVEN was allowed to settle early, moved up five wide into the upper stretch, dug in nearing the sixteenth pole and prevailed under strong
encouragement. HOT N SPICY LOVE settled towards the back early on, made a good six wide bid through the stretch and finished gamely to the wire.
CHARGING LION stalked the pace, raced four wide at the quarter pole and finished willingly to the wire. HE'S ZIPPIN ON BY stalked the pace while racing
between horses, raced along the inside in the drive and had not enough late. INDIAN GHOST pressed the pace while racing two wide and gave way.
SHOTMASTER was slow early, raced five deep in the stretch and never was a factor. AMERICANO was off slow, rushed from the inside to set all the pace
along the inside, raced in tight quarters nearing the quarter pole and tired in the drive.
