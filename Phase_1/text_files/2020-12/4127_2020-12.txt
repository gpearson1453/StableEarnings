Footnotes
PRETTY RACHEL stalked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide near the five-sixteenths pole, seized command turning for home and drew off under a
drive. BOURMA set the pace along the rail, was collared entering the lane, proved no match for the winner but held well to preserve the place. WE BLESS
LUCK saved ground off the pace, lacked a rally and bested the rest. ONE NIGHT STAND went evenly while racing three wide. PEACHY QUEEN prompted
the pace two wide, was pushed three wide by the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole and faded. LADY JAE steadily faded three wide. LADY TAPATIA
hopped at the start and trailed inside.

Footnotes
WORDS OF DEVINE trailed early on, advanced four wide around the turn, then sustained her rally through the lane while on her left lead, worn down the
leader at the sixteenth pole, and cleared off. DOMINEER sprinted off with mild encouragement from the rider early on, opened up a wide lead, began to tire
while shifting off of the rail passing the three sixteenths pole, stayed clear through midstretch, but was worn down a sixteenth out. REGGAE REVOLUTION
rated off of the pace in the three path around the turn, but was outkicked by the eventual winner turning for home, then stayed on for a minor share.
GASPARILLA BLAST settled off of the pace, but failed to mount a rally. SAMMY'S TOWN broke outwards a bit, stalked the clear leader from the two path
around the turn, but was outmoved by outer foes turning for home, then chased through upper stretch before tiring. Due to a timer malfunction, this race was
hand-timed.

PRINCESS CORO set the pace along the rail and held clear under a drive. SHOUG settled off the pace inside, angled three wide nearing the quarter pole
and rallied outside. SASSY CAT stalked the pace two wide, bid nearing the lane, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch, chased between
rivals, was in tight late and checked in very deep stretch. EMPEROR'S SONG saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and had a mild rally
between. PRINCESS MERIDA failed to menace while racing two wide. DRAWNTOMUNNY veered out at the start, had speed three wide and tired in the
lane. MCALLENS MUSIC broke awkwardly, raced well back in the two path and had some belated interest. IMHAVINAVERYGOODAY was never involved.

Footnotes
PATTY H set the pace along the inside, shook clear from the pressing EXACT passing the three furlong pole, widened her advantage under driving
pressure straightening into the lane, then was wrapped up approaching the sixteenth pole. AIR CAVALRY chased the early pace setters from along the
inside, saved ground around the turn while inching a bit a closer, but proved no match for the clear leader while surpassing a tiring foe for place at the three
sixteenths pole, then gamely fended off SNACKSTER's bid for that position through the final sixteenth. SNACKSTER brushed the gate slightly at the start,
trailed the field in the two path around the turn, split foes in upper stretch to produce a bid for place at the sixteenth pole, but was denied that position by an

Footnotes
GHOSTLYPRINCE broke out and bumped RAULITO at the start, steadied into the first turn, was pulling while racing three wide around that bend, surged
forward four wide around the far turn, seized command nearing the eight pole, powered clear soon after and held firm under a drive. GOLOVKIN raced in
range two wide between foes for five furlongs, came three wide into the lane, was bumped in upper stretch then finished strongly inside of the winner.
RAULITO was bumped by the winner at the start, raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide turning for home and rallied outside. SWEENEY'S CAT
prompted the pace three wide, took the lead near the quarter pole but succumbed soon after. CONGRATS AGAIN saved ground in range, angled out in
upper stretch, bumped GOLOVKIN near the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly from there. ANDRES EDUARDO saved ground and failed to menace.
CHAMPION UP set a pressured pace along the pace along the rail and gave way near the quarter pole. KATHERN'S JOY unseated the rider and briefly ran
loose pre-race, raced three wide and never threatened. TRINNI SUMMER dueled between foes and tired nearing the lane.

Footnotes
PRINCESS BETTY tracked from midpack three wide, inched closer into the turn to bid at the seven sixteenths pole, vied outside of a pair of rivals around
the bend before assuming command while shifting down a path passing the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, and held sway under driving pressure.
DIZZY pursued from off of the pace two wide and between horses, advanced to lie in range of, and just behind, the trio of leaders in to the turn, tipped three
wide turning for home, and sustained a rally through the lane, but failed to reach the leader. TIZ ENOUGH stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail
turning for home, vied for place between horses in upper stretch while chasing the clear leader, shifted inwards approaching the sixteenth pole after her
inner counterpart weakened, but was outfinished for place by her outer foe. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL set the pace along the inside, felt pressure from a pair of
foes into and around the turn, but was headed at the quarter pole, then gave way in upper stretch. CAPTIVANT took the turn four wide while off of the pace,
and failed to factor. BIMINI pressed the pace setter two wide, vied between horses into the turn as the eventual winner ranged up along side, but weakened
approaching the quarter pole. CARISMATICA was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
BIG DRINK OF WATER got a bit antsy in the gate before it opened, rushed after a flatfooted start to set the pace along the inside, shook clear from a
pressing foe straightening into the lane, and edged further away under driving pressure. KOBE FIFTY TWO tracked from midpack two wide and between
horses, but steadied while getting shuffled back behind TANACITY ZIP into the turn, shifted inwards around the five sixteenths marker, then rallied along the
rail through the lane to secure place. BAD BEAT BRIAN lied far off of the pace two wide and between horses, commenced a rally turning for home, but
failed to split foes three wide in upper stretch, shifted inwards and attempted to split foes two wide passing the furlong pole, but again found a non-existent
hole. then kept on for a minor share in the late stages under mild urging. COOP TRIES HARDER rated off of the pace three wide early on, came into the
bend four wide before shifting down to be two wide turning for home, and rallied mildly through traffic through the lane. ALLEGEDLY PERFECT prompted
the pace three wide early on, then only outside of the eventual winner around the turn, but failed to keep pace with that foe passing the three sixteenths
grounds, and weakened through the late stages. PAGLIACCI got antsy in the gate before it opened, chased from midpack along the inside, tipped three
wide turning for home while attempting a rally, but falttened out in upper stretch. TENACITY ZIP pressed the pace two wide and between horses early on,
but failed to keep pace with those rivals into the turn, then chased around the bend before drifting four wide turning for home, and weakened.
UNPRECEDENTED tracked from midpack three to four wide around the turn, and failed to factor before fading. FIXED POINT trailed the field along the
inside early on, slightly steadied when getting too close to KOBE FIFTY TWO into the turn, then saved ground around the bend, but was outrun.

Footnotes
YAMATO settled off the pace while racing two wide, made progress two and three wide around the far turn, seized command nearing the eighth pole and
drew clear under moderate urging. MORNING STRIDE stalked the duel in the clear inside, briefly moved out to pass the pacesetters nearing the far turn,
took the lead near the three-eighths pole, quickly angled back in, led to midstretch but proved no match for the winner in the final furlong. PRINCE OF
ARABIA saved ground in midpack, went two wide around the far turn, could not quicken with the winner but outfinished a foe for the show. NOTSOSUBTLE
steadied incessantly while bottled up behind rivals inside through the opening mile, made progress around the final turn, steadied again off heels nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, angled out near the quarter pole and was outfinished for third. CAN'T TRUMP KITTEN played no factor while racing two and three
wide. STARSHIP ARAMIS set a pressured pace along the rail and tired around the far turn. QUEENS EMPIRE (IRE) failed to menace while racing two
wide. COWBOY'S HERO was outrun while racing two and three wide. SON OF OAHU dueled outside a foe a in the three path and retreated around the far
turn. The 10 furlong time was unavailable.

QUASAR MOON took a bump from an inner foe at the start, raced far off of the pace two wide, shifted five wide at the five sixteenths pole to commence a
rally, continued that gain while getting floated six wide turning for home, and sustained his charge to get up at the sixteenth pole before clearing off. SAINT
LARNED hopped at the start and settled far off of the pace three wide, improved into the turn before rallying five wide and between horses turning for home,
sustained his charge through the lane while hanging on his left lead inside of QUASAR MOON, but was outfinished by that foe in the final sixteenth.
PURECRAZIDUDE stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail turning for home to bid outside of the clear leader in upper stretch, but was outkicked by
outer foes passing the furlong pole. LETS PLAY HARDBALL vied three wide and between horses early on, drew clear passing the three furlong pole, stayed
clear around the turn, but tired in upper stretch, and was overhauled by outer foes approaching the sixteenth pole. RAGS FOR BRITCHES took a bump
from an inner rival at the start, causing him to bump an outer foe soon after, tracked from midpack four wide around the turn, but was outkicked by outer
foes turning for home before staying on for a minor placing. TONS OF GOLD saved ground from midpack, failed to shift outside of the leader and bid
through a large opening in upper stretch, finally did so in midstretch, but that hole was shut off approaching the sixteenth pole, causing him to steady. RED
FOG vied two wide and between horses leaving the chute, backed off and chased the clear leader from the three path around the turn, but was outkicked by
outer foes turning for home, and faded. SUPERHIGHWAY saved ground off of the pace, failed to respond to rider's urging to shift off of the rail in upper
stretch, and did not play a factor. BACANO vied four wide early on, two wide into the turn, but weakened passing the three furlong pole. ATAKAN broke
outwards bumping a foe into another, lied forwardly placed three wide leaving the cute, but was done early.
