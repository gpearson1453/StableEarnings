Footnotes
WELLING showed good early speed, set all the pace while racing along the inside and held gamely under strong encouragement. AND SEEK pressed the
early leader, raced four wide at the eighth pole and kept on to the wire. FAST CASH stalked the pace along the inside, moved up five wide nearing the three
sixteenths pole and finished willingly to the wire. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN was allowed to settle early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no
response. ROYAL THUNDER was hard rated down the backstretch, raced three wide around the far turn and failed to respond. TOE CURLIN' KISS
dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper lane and never was a factor.

Footnotes
LECTRIC CHOKE was allowed to settle in the early stages, raced towards the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch, angled four wide through the
lane, finished well and just got up under strong handling. INSTIGATED showed good early from the outside to set all the pace, dug in late and just missed in
a game effort. THE QUANTICO KID tracked the early leader while racing two deep and had not enough in the drive. EGO TRIP dropped back early, raced
four wide around the firs turn, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and made a mile late gain. BOSTON LIGHT stalked the early pace, raced four wide
at the three sixteenths pole and had no response. MUHLENBERG was unhurried early on, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.
AUDACIOUS QUALITY stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, raced four deep in the stretch and failed to respond. START FROM
SCRATCH raced far back, was eased up on the final eighth of a mile and walked off.

Footnotes
BANANAS ON FIRE bobbled at the break, tracked the leader while racing two deep down the backstretch, raced off the inside through the stretch and drew
off to be well clear under steady handling. SIR LENNY stalked the pace, moved up two wide into the upper stretch and was no match for the winner in the
drive. WHAT THE FLASH stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no late response. GREY GIANT broke a bit
awkward, moved up four wide nearing the eighth pole to improve his position but was never a serious threat. KID CAN RUN settled off the early going,
raced five wide at the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. SPANISH D'ORO dropped back early, raced six deep into the lane and never menaced.
GABRIELLA SUNSHINE bumped a foe when bearing in at the start, set all the pace and gave way while racing along the inside. RIP IT, bumped by
GABRIELLA SUNSHINE at the start, failed to respond.

CATCH THE SKY was allowed to settle early, moved up seven wide nearing the eighth pole and finished well to be clear under strong handling.
ELOQUENT LADY stalked the early pace, raced in the six path through the stretch and finished second best. PROMENADE PRINCESS settled off the early
going, angled six wide through the stretch and closed in late. BOURBON GAL dropped back early, improved her position through the drive but had not
enough while racing near the inside. A TOAST TO KAY stalked the pace, raced four deep nearing the eighth pole and had no late response. SEVILLA
SANGRIA stalked the pace and weakened while racing four deep. ANSELMI failed to respond. KEEPER IN SPITE set all the pace from the outside and
gave way. STEP BY STEP pressed early and tired. MS. HAITI stumbled at the break and never menaced.

Footnotes
OXIDE was forwardly positioned in opening stages and continued just off the leader to the turn, launched a two wide bid for IN THE LOOP nearing the
quarter pole, remained determined and continued to edge up closer to the lead, reached IN THE LOOP with a sixteenth left to run and forged clear under a
driving finish. IN THE LOOP led the way out of the gate and remained the leader through the backstretch, held firm around the turn then roused for more
entering top of the lane, fought back gamely when challenged by OXIDE in late stages but failed to hold on. ROYAL CRUSADER settled in range through
early stages, hustled up along the rail around the turn, tipped out a couple paths in upper stretch and cotninued a steady bid for a share. ABUELO PAPS
raced near midpack through the early going, picked up the pace four wide around the turn, hustled along five to six wide into the lane and needed more for
serious impact. DOOBIEDOOBIEDOOBIE was unhurried down the backstretch, swung to the outside and hustled along into the stretch and gained position
without threatening. UNEQUIVOCAL settled through early stages then coaxed four wide around the turn, swung out wider for the drive and failed to move
on. RUSSELDOINGTHINGS tracked the pace down the backstretch, loomed a threat racing three wide at the quarter pole then failed to sustain bid into the
lane. ORDER FOR PORKY raced in tracking mode not far off the early leader then had no response when called upon in the turn. MOOSE LODGE raced
near the back then urged two wide around the turn and lacked a needed rally. MCCAIN gained a couple spots leaving the backstretch then flattened back
out.

SEIZE THE DAY advanced strides out of the gate and gained a clear advantage, held firm over pursuers around the turn, tapped a few times nearing the
eighth pole, stayed sharp in response and coasted clear. GALLINIPPER raced behind the pacesetter in opening stages and tracked rival into the turn,
launched a bid for command racing two to three wide near the five-sixteenths pole, remained in steady pursuit while solid in response but was no match for
sharp winner. EXCHANGE FEVER hustled along entering the turn and advanced into closer contention near the quarter pole then sustained a steady bid
and raced along for a share. LITTLE BAY raced in range through early stages, hustled along two wide around the turn, tipped out wider for the drive and
flattened out. AMAZING CAT raced in contention and chased the pace along the rail around the turn then gave way. OVERPOWER was slow into stride out
of the gate, remained off the pace and never got going. WONDERMEISTER dropped to last after the opening quarter and had no response.
