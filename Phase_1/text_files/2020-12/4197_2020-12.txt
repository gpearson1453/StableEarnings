Footnotes
GINNY B went around the first turn in the five path, settled near the back on the outside, circled four then five wide on the far turn, rallied to the lead lead
into the upper stretch then drifted in while kicking clear, drew off under a strong hand ride into the final sixteenth then was eased up in the final forty yards. I
HEAR YOU went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear of the field, moved closer in the two path on the far turn, was blocked at the
quarter-pole at the same time as the winner made an outside move, steadied while remaining blocked to the three-sixteenths then altered course to the
outside and finished with good energy for the place. ARTISTIC JEWLER broke out at the start, was taken in hand early then moved in before the first turn,
settled on the inside, moved closer late on the backstretch, drafted along the rail on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, brushed with a foe while
squeezing through along the rail at the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. PRINCESA BLANCA was away
quickly, rounded the first turn in the four path, settled on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, was urged three then four wide on the far turn,
spun just a bit further out into the stretch and came up empty. NATIVE LION was taken in hand while showing early speed then carried out into the first turn,
raced in the four path on that bend, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip,
brushed with a rival while dropping back near the three-sixteenths and tired. PSEUDONYM was taken in hand while showing early speed, had the rider fall
back in the saddle while lugging out three wide into the first turn then dropped to the two path, set the pace through moderate fractions, vied in the two path
on the far turn, lost the lead into upper stretch, dropped back between horses while brushing with foes at the three-sixteenths and capitulated. (Rail at 7

clear at the five-sixteenths, extended the advantage under a drive into the final furlong and held under strong urging. DARLING JOANNA moved in while
urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, moved out inside the three-sixteenths, drifted out around the sixteenth-pole and finished with
good energy for the place. SPEAK TO ME was reluctant to load then last away, bumped hard with a foe just after the start then was taken up sharply,
spotted the front many lengths, moved up with a half-mile to run, started the turn in the two path, gained while shifting three then four wide later on that
bend, lugged inward while still on her inside lead in upper stretch, switched to the proper lead coming to the furlong marker and flattened out while clear for
the show. AMERICAN REBEL was carried out at the start, raced well back in the field, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide at the quarter-pole,
angled out in upper stretch and improved position. OUR MARDI GRAS hit the inside of the gate at the start, settled on the outside, was urged four then five
wide on the turn and failed to rally. GLORY TO ME bumped hard with a rival just after the start then dropped back, fell well behind under strong urging,
rounded the turn in the two path, turned into the stretch under the whip and gained good ground but failed to threaten. MY GIRL SWEET bumped with a rival
at the start then came outward, moved up to duel for the lead on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, dropped back at
the five-sixteenths and tired. G'S MINE broke out at the start, was well spotted behind the dueling leaders, went three then four wide on the turn, came five
wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
SALVAJE drifted out early, chased the pace on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, shook clear inside the
furlong marker, remained clear under a drive into the final sixteenth and was kept to the task while drifting out late to prevail. FAIRCHILD broke in and a bit
slow, spotted the front a few lengths then dropped back, settled at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and
finished fast for the place but was too late then galloped out in front. PIE KILLER was coaxed along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, pursued the
winner in the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. JACQUELYN D'ORO exchanged bumps with a foe at the start, angled in while
rated just off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, made a bid while put to a drive in upper stretch, battled inside of the winner into the final furlong
and was outfinished then missed the trifecta. OFFICE PARTY was quickly snatched with the left-rein at the start, bumped with a foe early, was urged off the
pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths, drifted in outside the
sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. PAYTONSATTHEPLATE settled well back on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came seven wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. EUPHORIC exchanged bumps with a foe at the start, was urged along on the outside, went four then five wide on the
turn and failed to rally. HOODWINK was hustled to the lead and set the clear pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, lost the advantage in upper
stretch and gave way. GATHERED FLOWERS was away well then carried out early, settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and came up
empty. TIZ FOR REAL came in at the start, bumped with a foe early, settled off the pace, checked while lugging out five wide into the turn, dropped to the
four path shortly thereafter, moved to the three then two path late on that bend and was no factor. (Rail at 7 Feet)

the backstretch, engaged the leader in the three path on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker and drew
away under steady urging. BEAUTIFUL TRAUMA was hustled to the lead, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the pace through solid fractions, was

wide into upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. LONGPANTS REQUIRED saved ground on the first turn,

MONEY WELL SPENT showed good speed, set the clear pace on the inside, responded well when set down in upper stretch and drew off under a solid
hand ride to win ridden out. DANCE AWAY was urged along on the outside, went four to five wide on the turn, paused when a neighboring foe went wrong
at the five-sixteenths and earned the place while no match for the winner. FOR REAL ALICE was coaxed along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, hit a
fallen foe at the five-sixteenths and checked, saved ground into the stretch and got up for the show. STAR PRADO chased the pace on the outside, went
two to three wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. BALOOK broke very fast, tracked the pace down the
backstretch, was asked in the two path midway through the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, moved out under a drive at the three-sixteenths and
lacked the needed response. MANDOLINE STAR broke a step slow, settled off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went four wide early on the
turn, steadied and swerved five wide to avoid the spill at the five-sixteenths and came up empty. SUCKERFORAGREY dropped back while urged along,
went three to four wide early on the turn, checked sharply while going over a fallen foe at the five-sixteenths then was eased in the stretch but walked off.
KEHRON'S CREED settled off the pace, was urged in the two path on the turn, struck the fallen foe at the five-sixteenths and fell hard then returned to her
feet and was walked off after the race. CARAMEL LATTE was urged along off the pace, raced three wide on the turn, went wrong at the five-sixteenths and
fell. Following a stewards' inquiry into the incident at the five-sixteenths, no change was made to the order of finish

CLUB SODA bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed then moved clear near the half-mile pole, drew off in the two path on the turn, responded well
when shaken up in upper stretch and proved much the best under steady urging. FLASH ATTACK was urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the
turn, turned into the stretch under a drive, moved out near the furlong marker and just got up for the place. BAJAN CASH was urged along well back in the
field, went two to three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and just missed the place while able to get the show. GO FOR MOONSHINE
bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed response. FAMILIAR RHYTHM was urged
along near the back, went three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BEAUTY BOY brushed with a foe at the start,
was hard ridden towards the front of the spread-out field, went three wide on the turn and came up empty. KASILOF was urged along on the outside, went
four wide on the turn and had nothing left. KID SLIPPER showed speed on the inside of the winner then chased the pace, dropped further behind that foe in
the two path on the turn and tired. NINTH STREET brushed with a rival at the start then dropped back, went three to four wide for most of the turn then
shifted five wide and failed to respond.

Footnotes
JOEMO was sent hard from the start, took an awkward stride against the rail into the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the inside, saved ground
through the far turn, was roused in the two path into the stretch, chased the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong, gained the lead outside the
sixteenth-pole, battled outside of the runner-up to the wire and prevailed under strong handling. IN CHARGE HALO broke out a bit then went to the front,
rounded the first turn in the two path, set the pace through sensible fractions, vied inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths,
came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead outside the sixteenth-pole, fought on with the winner to the wire and just missed while well clear for the
place. SOCIAL MISFIT broke out at the start, went three to four wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, went three wide on the far turn, moved out
