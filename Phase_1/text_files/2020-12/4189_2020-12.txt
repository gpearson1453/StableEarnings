FUNNY bumped with SUNNY HILL BOBBIE while two wide between rivals into the turn then gained to the end. ALL ABOUT REYANA had position three
wide to the stretch then tired. UNEMOTIONAL broke in the air while slow from the gate, raced two wide around the turn and gained late. INSPIRED GEM
made the pace along the rail for just over a half then tired. SASSY AND HOT was outrun. DAMISELA stopped inside after a half. SUNNY HILL BOBBIE
bumped with TRULY FUNNY and hit the rail entering the turn then stopped. An objection by Lloyd against the fourth finisher was not allowed.

MOJAC KAT pressed outside the early leader, moved two wide to the front midway on the turn, responded when challenged in early stretch and drew out
late. R RAJUN BULL settled, rallied three wide around the turn, loomed boldly outside the winner into the final furlong then flattened out late. BUSCH
LATTE was slow early, stayed inside and lacked a strong closing. GOLDFORTHENEWYEAR had his head turned to the inside when the doors opened, left
several lengths behind the field and was outrun three wide. QUICKER took command at once, made the pace along the rail into the turn then stopped.
EMBEED briefly showed speed, stopped and was vanned off after the finish.
