MEMPHISINMAY away alertly, set all the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best under a brisk hand ride. DARKNSTORMYTIME
allowed to settle, had a mild late rally inside and got up for second. PIRATE'S TREASURE chased the winner three wide then was outfinished for second.
NANTAN stalked the pace through the far turn then wilted. REPLAY was no factor. CLYDE PARK chased the early pace near the inside and was through
after a half.

MONSTER HUNTER stalked the early pace, rallied three wide to make the lead near the furlong marker and proved best in a game effort. TIDE RISING
stalked the pace for a half, loomed boldly four wide in upper stretch and finished second best. KETTLE KING pressed the pace two wide into the stretch,
checked when in a bit tight at the eighth poke and dropped out of it. MA MOOS WARRIOR made the lead soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch,
drifted out a bit and weakened. VOLUME OF TRUST was never close, and veered out in upper stretch when struck with a left handed whip. DEVINE PRIDE
inside, had brief speed. TRIGGER POWER was through early. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
LAKE NIMROD never far back, rallied two wide and proved best in a long drive. EAGLES PALACE dueled for the lead two wide then along the inside, led
late then couldn't handle the winner. BRISKY angled out to the six path soon after the start, was in tight behind a rivals near the seven sixteenths pole,
closed into the stretch and finished with good courage. AXIS stalked the pace into the stretch then faded. PANAMANIAN TEASER dueled for the early lead
along the inside then gave way in the stretch. AMERICAN SOLUTION had speed into the turn then faded. MARSEILLE'SCOWTOWN was outrun. PRIVATE
DANCER was no factor. THE TRAINER OF BRISKY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE AT THE THREE FURLONG MARKER, AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
