GEMINATOR stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a forward position entering the drive, dueled through
the drive and inched clear late. MY HARVEY outrun early, steadily advanced outside, reached a striking position entering the drive, responded when asked
and closed with a rush for the place. NATE'S FURY was off a step slow, rushed up outside to duel for the early margin, remained engaged up the
backstretch, remained forward but had nothing left. ONE SMOOTH KATCH forced the early pace outside, inched closer entering the second turn, dueled
through the drive but could not keep pace. CLASSY'S FAST ROY went evenly. PRICED RIGHT dueled from the inside and tired. ZIPPIT ZIPPY was no
factor. MINISTER MICKEY was five wide into the first turn and no threat. K FOR KOHEN was never close. ESCAPE THE GALAXY vied from the inside and
faded.

Footnotes
MUCH CLASS stalked the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a forward position entering the second turn, angled
outside for the drive, responded and was just up the final stride. DECEMBER SEVEN dueled from the outside early, gained a clear margin up the
backstretch, remained clear through the second turn, continued to show the way at the eighth pole but could not last. FORGOTTEN COAST outrun early,
advanced inside through the second turn, responded and rallied late for the show. KRAFTY BOY forced the early pace outside, made a bid entering the
second turn and had a late gain. EXTON was never a factor. ALWAYS A CATCH was no threat. NATEALYZE forced the early pace inside and tired.
DIPLOMATIC SHAFT was finished after going a half.

Footnotes
REACH THE CIRCLE stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded to duel through the drive and was just up the
final strides. SPENDAHOLIC bobbled at the start, was up close from the outside, dueled through the turn, remained engaged through the drive and was
outfinished. LENAPE DRIVE dueled from between foes early, battled through the turn, remained engaged for the drive but could not keep pace. BAPTISM
dueled from the inside early, battled through the turn but had nothing for the drive. D'ROCK was never a factor. DERBY DOG was no threat. MY PERFECT
GRAYDAR was never close. HAUS dueled from the inside and gave way. Due to a timer malfunction this race was hand timed.

Footnotes
POPS LEGACY well placed from the inside early, inched closer up the backstretch, reached a forward position entering the second turn, gained the margin
entering the drive and was well clear while kept to task. YEOWZER outrun early, advanced outside through the second turn, responded when asked and
closed with a surge for the place. KING OF THE TESTO unhurried early from the outside, advanced through the second turn, responded entering the drive
but could only hold position. WEKNEWUWERETROUBLE chased the early pace outside but could not keep pace. VALLEY OF THE HIDE forced the early
pace inside then tired in the drive. FROM NOW ON was no factor. INDIUM had a steady fade. WHEN I DO broke sharp from the outside, gained the early
margin, remained clear up the backstretch then faded in the drive. PINE GROVE ROAD broke out at the start, chased the early pace and tired. PER
RULING #24198 FROM THE LOUISIANA RACING COMMISSION, POPS LEGACY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE
TEST.
