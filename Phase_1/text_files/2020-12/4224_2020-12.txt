I WANT A PICTURE well placed from the inside early, dueled through the turn, remained engaged through the drive, responded to pressure and inched
clear late. HALFMOON REEF bobbled at the start, was outrun early, steadily advanced through the turn, came five wide into the drive and was up for the
place. MAN CAMP dueled from the outside early, remained engaged through the turn but could not keep pace in the drive. AW SHUCKS broke awkward
from between foes, chased the early pace inside, responded entering the drive and had a late gain. COLONEL PIKE went evenly. ROYAL REALITY dueled
from the inside and tired. STORMATION was never close. BOSTON REPO had a steady fade.

Footnotes
ZUGERSEE unhurried early from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn, angled outside for
the drive, responded and was just up the final stride. QUEEN GIGI dueled from the outside early, battled up the backstretch, fought through the second turn,
remained engaged for the drive but was outfinished. WILL B LATE chased the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a
forward position entering the second turn, altered outside for the drive and was just up for the show. SPLASHDOWN well placed from the inside, inched
closer entering the second turn, made a bid entering the drive, drifted in mid stretch then weakened late. HEATHER DIVINE could only improve position.
SALT LIFE ANGEL dueled from the inside and tired. BULLETSANDBOURBON was no factor. GOLDEN EXPRESSO had a steady fade. MY LITTLE
GARDNER was never close.

Footnotes
BINDING stalked the early pace from the outside, advanced up the backstretch, dueled through the second turn, gained the margin entering the drive and
steadily drew away. BAUDETTE BLIZZARD dueled from the outside early, gained a clear margin up the backstretch, was engaged by the winner entering
the second turn, dueled with that one through the drive but was no match late while second best. LIAM SKYE unhurried early from the outside, steadily
advanced up the backstretch, made a bid entering the drive but could only hold position. MISTER INTUITION pressed the early pace from the inside, inched
closer entering the second turn but could not keep pace. PURIM KING could only improve position. HIGH RIDGE went evenly. CLASSIC GREELEY was
five wide into the first turn and no factor. SMOOTH CURRENT broke out at the start, hit the gate, was rank early and no threat. MEDITATE dueled from the
inside early, chased the pace up the backstretch then gave way. DOUBLE COOL was six wide into the first turn and never close. PER RULING #24199
FROM THE LOUISIANA RACING COMMISSION, BINDING WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
