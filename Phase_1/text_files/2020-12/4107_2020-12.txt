KAREN'S GEM dueled inside for the early lead, battled with AUSSIE MIST on the turn, dug in gamely inside of that rival in a prolonged stretch duel and
inched away nearing the wire. AUSSIE MIST dueled two wide for the lead, battled with the winner throughout, dug in gamely outside in the stretch run and
was outfinished late. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up entering the stretch and rallied late on the rail. KNOCK OUT KID
raced off the pace between rivals, saved ground on the turn, angled out and finished evenly. IMPERIAL LADY chased three wide, raced two wide on the
turn, came three wide into the lane and had no rally. SALLY O'PRADO was outrun early, raced three wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane and
failed to threaten. FACTORING raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

Footnotes
G DADDY set the pace in four path and drew clear under a drive. INDIRECTLY broke slowly, moved up three wide, took an awkward step near mid stretch
and was no match. JUMP SHOT came out and bumped with BRIDLECREST leaving the gate, steadied trying to split rivals near the quarter pole.
BRIDLECREST came in and bumped with JUMP SHOT leaving the gate, saved ground and never threatened. JAMES CIRO saved ground just off the pace
then tired. JUST ENOUGH, four wide in second flight, was finished after a half. CAUSE I SAID SO, five wide, gave way near the stretch. ALWAYS FREE
raced very wide throughout. RODEO RED was two wide in top flight, stopped suddenly when bleeding from the nostrils.

handling and was in hand the final yards. VALERIE FIRST raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn, went four wide past the quarter pole,
rallied and came up second best. WITH ME WITHOUT ME raced off the pace inside, moved up at the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane and rallied
mildly outside for third. PAOLLA'S HEART stalked outside through the early stages, made a three wide bid on the far turn, could not go with the winner, then
weakened. VALIANT SPIRIT stalked outside, chased the leaders on the far turn and tired. DON'TTOUCHMYSTUFF veered in at the break, vied inside for
the lead, dueled on the far turn and tired. GEORGIA BONNET was outrun.

OCEANO ROSSO vied outside for the lead, set the pace on the backside, dueled on the far turn, drifted out wide passing the quarter pole, responded to
right handed urging and was kept clear for the win. TWO CARAT stalked between rivals, then three wide, raced three wide on the far turn, closed well late
and was along for the place spot. BANGLE GAL raced five wide early, then stalked three wide, bid four wide on the far turn, rallied in the stretch run and
was outkicked. FLORENCIA raced four wide early, then settled off the pace while saving ground, waited for room along the rail on the far turn, then finished
evenly. HAY BUCK tracked along the inside, then two wide, chased on the far turn and lacked a winning bid. MIJA BELLA raced off the rail, off the pace,
came four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. PARTY IN THE SAND raced off the pace inside and did not factor. TIZ A DATE vied inside for
command, dueled with the winner on the far turn and faded.
