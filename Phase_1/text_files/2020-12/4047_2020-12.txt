Footnotes
TOWN JAK saved ground early, moved up after a half, went three wide racing into the stretch, took over and opened a long lead with a furlong to run and
maintained under pressure. SINCERE MAN, racing just off the rail, moved out four wide into stretch, took up chase but had no late bid. BIG BAD BUD
stumbled leaving the gate then came out and bumped HEART OF A DREAMER, raced wide and passed tiring foes. SURFER BOY GEORGE raced wide,
drifted out entering the stretch, drifted in through deep stretch. DIZZY SIGHT broke sharply as the field left the starting gate six minutes past scheduled post
time, saved ground disputing the pace, drifted out through deep stretch and tired. ABDAA broke slowly, raced outside, changed course when in a bit tight
deep stretch. HEART OF A DREAMER, bumped leaving the gate, was wide on the first turn, split rivals on the final turn then tired. IT'S PAZIBLE, unruly
loading, ducked out leaving the gate, dueled inside then tired. BILL'S MAFIA raced outside and showed only brief speed. QUALITY SPECIAL failed to
menace with an inside trip. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF ADBAA AGAINST DIZZY SIGHT IN THE STRETCH WAS DISMISSED.

Footnotes
CHAMPERS, in the four path but inside top flight, fought back gamely after losing the lead near mid stretch then slowly inched away. CHUB ON DA RUN
was lapped on winner, stuck his head in front near furlong grounds but was unable to match strides late. DON'T RECALL saved ground throughout and had
no rally. REBEL TRAVELLER, just off the rail and never far back, came up empty. GHOST FIGHTER raced wide and was well placed but faded through the
stretch. CASPER JOE, in the four path and just off the path, tired late. TRIBULATION raced wide and failed to menace. PRINCE CHAMP was very wide
and showed little. GRANDFIRE dueled for command three wide, drifted out near quarter pole and then fell back. FACTUM LOVE STYLE was wide and
showed nothing. PREFONTAINE stumbled leaving the gate then was outrun.

Footnotes
SPIRIT WOLF tracked close up on the inside, saved ground on the turn, waited for room nearing the quarter pole, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied
outside of MR GAZZO, gained command in deep stretch and drew clear. MR GAZZO set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way on the turn, dug
in gamely on the rail in the final furlong and yielded grudgingly. HOLLYWOOD JET was bumped at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace, bid three wide
on the turn, weakened in the lane and held third. BE YOURSELF stumbled at the start, raced two wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn and
rallied mildly. COBBLE ROAD stumbled at the start, raced off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, gained mildly and bested the others. MAC AND
BREEZE chased between rivals and weakened. VOY A TI stalked two wide, chased on the turn and tired. IMMINENT DANGER chased inside and tired.
ORACABESSA broke in bumped rivals at the start, chased three wide and tired. SMART TEE raced off the pace inside and was outrun. GO SKIPPY GO
was bumped at the start and steadied, then outrun. MISSED THE BUS was bumped at the start, raced inside and did not factor.
