Footnotes
IRISH HOKIE dropped back at the start, settled comfortably off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, rallied through a
clear rail opening into upper stretch, closed well to get the lead inside the three-sixteenths, shook clear into the final furlong and held under strong urging.
TAKAFUMI (BRZ) was off slow and spotted the front a couple lengths, settled towards the rear, started the turn in the three path, shifted four wide while
roused near the five-sixteenths, came seven wide into upper stretch, steadied briefly off heels at the three-sixteenths, gained outside in the final furlong and
earned the place. DISCREET TIGER moved while going to the font, showed the way down the backstretch, vied along the rail for most of the turn, lugged
out three wide outside the quarter-pole, came under the whip after turning into the stretch, lost the advantage inside the three-sixteenths, dropped back into
the final furlong and weakened but held the show. DREW'S SHOT was eased back off the pace then moved out, chased the leader on the outside, went
three then four wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch and tired. D TWO tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch,
went five wide on the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and faltered. HEAD-ON REPLAY NOT AVAILABLE

the stretch, angled out while roused near the three-sixteenths, was given one tap of a down-turned whip at that point, closed fast on the outside under a
hand ride, cruised to the front outside the sixteenth-pole then widened under a mild hand ride to win ridden out. UNITEDANDRESOLUTE dueled on the
outside of DEVIL'S FIRE, opened up a gigantic advantage in tandem with that foe, vied in the two path on the turn then spun three wide into the stretch,
edged clear while drifting out a bit inside the three-sixteenths, was collared by the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and tired while just able to hold the
place. LEROY JENKINS broke awkwardly and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, was urged along at the back, rounded the turn in the two path,
angled out inside the furlong marker and finished with good energy just miss the place. DEVIL'S FIRE dueled on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on
the turn, spun into the stretch in the two path, dropped back past the three-sixteenths and capitulated. BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL was ridden along in third

Footnotes
PURE VALOR broke out at the start, settled off the pace, went around most of the turn in the two path, waited behind horses passing the five-sixteenths,
shifted three wide outside the quarter-pole then was roused while swinging five wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed strongly to get the lead
outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. CAEUS IN PASADENA settled off the pace, dropped in to save ground on the turn,
moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole but was outfinished while clear for the place. CHAMBLISS was
bumped at the start and forced into another foe then taken up while pinched back, settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn and improved position to get
the show. FAREWELL TIME was hustled to the lead then quickly moved clear, extended the advantage in the two to three path on the turn, was guided with
extra left-rein pressure, came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened. FLEET RUN tracked the pace on
the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, steadied outside the furlong marker then altered in a few paths and lacked the
needed kick. ALMA DERBY was forced out at the start then bumped with a rival, settled off the pace, went four wide under urging on the turn and came up
empty. RICHARD RONALD bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the outside, was ridden along while four wide on the turn and failed to rally. IPIDATE
bumped with foes on both sides at the start, settled on the outside, was urged along while moving from three to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the
stretch and failed to respond. Following an objection by the rider of FLEET RUN against CAEUS IN PASADENA, the stewards' disqualified CAEUS IN
PASADENA from second and placed him fifth for interference in upper stretch.

Footnotes
LADY KAZA went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace in the two path, extended the lead while asked on the far turn, drew off under the whip
into the final furlong then was placed under a hand ride to the wire while much the best. COLD HEARTED WENCH went around the first turn in the two
path, was well spotted while rated just off the pace, chased two then three wide on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and safely secured
the place while no match for the winner. ORB'S SOUL broke through the gate prior to the start but remained in the stall, went three wide on the first turn,
was reserved towards the back, started the far turn in the four path, dropped to the two path around the three-eighths and lacked the needed response while
best of the rest. MISS COMMISH went four to six wide on the turns and failed to threaten. SUMMER EXPRESS dropped back at the start, went two to three
wide on the turns and was no factor. TALE OF MONA bumped with a rival at the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled in the middle of the
spread-out field, saved ground on the far turn and failed to respond. SNEAKY DIANNE bumped with a rival at the start, went four to five wide on the turns
and also failed to respond. RUNAWAY DREAM was fractious in the gate, went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was urged three
then four wide on the far turn and retreated. CAZADORA broke out and bumped with a foe, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, came
under urging outside the half-mile pole, retreated in the three path on the far turn and was eased in the final furlong but walked off. GOTTABEGOLDEN
bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground on the first turn, tugged at the bit under restraint early on the backstretch, was through after a half-mile and
faltered then was eased in the final furlong but also walked off.

furlong, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. NUNC PRO TUNC tracked
the pace on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, gained to make a bid at the quarter-pole then took the lead in upper stretch, led to the
sixteenth-pole, battled very gamely with the winner to the wire and was denied while clear for the place. SAINTSGOTROBBED was reluctant to load but

Footnotes
ZANESVILLE went around the first turn in the two path, settled on the inside of a rival, moved closer with a half-mile to run, drafted in the two path on the far
turn, waited patiently behind horses from the quarter-pole to the three-sixteenths, moved out while roused outside the eighth-pole, accelerated into the final
furlong, gained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and drew away under strong urging. TREYS MIDNITE MOON went three wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, moved closer with a half-mile to run, ranged up three to four wide on the far turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole then took the lead in
upper stretch, was headed by the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and proved no match while clear for the place. CHOP CHOP CHARLIE was away
alertly, went four wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the far turn, was asked late on that bend then
came under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and tired. CAYMANS COBRA set the pace on the
inside, was asked on the far turn, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and capitulated. CARBONATED reared at the start and stayed in the gate,
came out about eight lengths behind the field, saved ground on the turns and was no factor. RIVER EVANGELIST was slow into stride, went five wide on
the turns and faltered.

Footnotes
C'MON VE angled in while speeding clear, dictated terms along the rail on the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch and maintained a safe
advantage under strong urging. FREE INDEED settled off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, came out into upper stretch and
finished with good energy for the place. WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG settled towards the front, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch
and finished willingly but missed the place while clear for the show. BOOTH ROAD SHINE settled in the front half of the field, was urged along while two
then three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. WABASH CANNONBALL dropped back while urged
along, raced inside to the two path on the turn and improved position. SEELEY was carried out at the start, raced off the pace under urging, went four to five
wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. EIGHTS WILD was last to commence, went three wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch, moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths, dropped in outside the sixteenth-pole and was no factor. PHILLY tracked the pace on
the outside, went three to four wide on the turn and came up empty. SPRING VALUE raced well back in the field, moved from four to six wide on the turn,
came seven wide into the stretch and also was no factor. INSPECTOR EDDIE settled off the early pace while amongst rivals then came under urging, went
around the turn in the two to three path, was driven four wide into the stretch and also failed to respond. JAKE THE BAND MAN broke out at the start, was
urged along on the outside, moved from three to five wide on the turn and capitulated.
