Footnotes
UNMASKED dueled for the lead from outside, three wide into the stretch, kicked clear from rivals while drifting out and was kept to task to the wire. ED
GATTY well placed behind the top trio, went three wide into the turn, angled out into the stretch, finished well and earned the place. HALLOWED GIFT
attended the pace three deep into and around the turn, chased the winner in the lane, angled in upper stretch and finished evenly. BARHOPSKY sat off the
pace early, went between rivals then five wide into the stretch, responded mildly in the late stages and edged rival for a small award. SHOULD BE ILLEGAL
dueled from inside to the stretch and weakened late. BELHAM traveled off the rail then angled in nearing the turn, saved ground into the stretch and could
not rally. LORD VADER went three wide into the turn, five wide into the drive, gradually moved to the rail in the stretch and was not a threat. MOONSHINE
MOMENT went four to six wide around the bend and proved no menace. THE THIRD RING chased the speed from inside, two wide leaving the turn and
faded.

Footnotes
LEPRINO off slow and broke out a bit, advanced from the outside, ranged up five to six wide into the stretch, dueled with BABY GRONK in the final furlong
and was all out to edged rival. BABY GRONK stalked four deep early, asked four wide around the turn, took a short lead mid-stretch, dueled with LEPRINO
late and got outkicked. SQUALOTORO settled off the pace, went two to three wide around the turn, angled out upper stretch, closed well and kept gaining
to the wire. KINCAID PARK came in and bumped rival early, pressed from outside, lost a bit of ground leaving the backstretch, re-bid three wide around the
turn, proved no match for the top pair and lost the show late. ROSSMAN set the pace under pressure, inched away from rival nearing the turn, challenged
again around the turn and weakened in the drive. ETTERBAY UCKLAY tracked off the inside, went four wide through the turn and failed to rally.
NIETZSCHE in range of the speed near the inside, saved ground into the drive and flattened out in the final furlong. SURFSIDE SUNSET off a bit slow to
begin, angled to the inside, tipped out a bit on the turn, angled inside rival in upper stretch and never made an impact. KING PARKER chased between
rivals up the backstretch, two wide around the turn, angled out a bit in the lane and lacked further response. DOHENY BEACH bumped by outside rival
early, chased between foes then angled in on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
AS TIME GOES BY settled off the pace, went outside a rival then three deep into the turn, range up four wide, took control in upper stretch, kicked clear and
drew off under right-handed urging. EYES OPEN well placed behind the speed from inside, exited the bend two wide, bid between foes in upper stretch,
could not match the winner in the late stages but held the place. MY HAPPY GIRL trailed the field early, entered the three wide then exited five wide, rallied
late but could not get up for the place honors. MISS MO' LICIOUS off alertly then dropped back to track the top pair, asked three wide around the turn,
tipped out in the stretch and kept on through the final furlong. FIERCE FOR SUL brushed inside rival at the start, pressed from outside then challenged
around the turn, vied between into the stretch then gave way. BAY WITCH set a pressured pace, vied with rivals around the turn and into the stretch, then
faded out of contention. WILD RIDE brushed at the start, angled in on the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MOONLIGHT D'ORO went four then three wide around the clubhouse turn, stalked outside a rival, bid three wide around the far turn, headed rival at the
quarter pole, took over shortly after, cleared rival at the three-sixteenths pole and drew away. FROSTERIA sped to the front, set the pace in the two path,
met bid around the final turn, relinquished the lead past the quarter pole, could not go on with the winner past the three-sixteenths pole but was clearly
second best. MORAZ stalked off the rail, roused around the second bend, entered the stretch three to four wide, drifted to the inside, steadily through the
stretch and held the show. MADE IN KAROO went four then three wide around the first turn, exited the far turn two to three wide and failed to rally.
MISCHIEF FREE trailed the field early, saved ground into the drive and passed tired rivals. SCARRAZANO up close along the inside, lost ground leaving
the backstretch, dropped back around the far turn and faded. FULL OF LAUGHS traveled five then four wide around the first turn, tracked the pace from
outside, went three wide into the lane and tired.

NEXT FLIGHT chased from outside, four then three wide around the turn, stayed within range in the lane then summoned a late bid and got up in time.
LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH had early speed outside a pair of rivals, dueled outside a rival around the turn, cleared foe near the three-sixteenths marker,
remained clear to the sixteenth pole then got caught on the line. CHICO BABY off the pace early on, traveled two wide into the turn, angled out into the
stretch, rallied and closed the gap on the top pair. MINOSO tracked outside a rival, bumped with that one into the turn, spun four wide off the turn and
lacked a bid. TORPEDO AWAY raced between foes early then outside a rival, angled five wide into the stretch and never made an impact. UNCAPTURED
HERO sent for the lead and went up between rivals, dueled for command from inside through the turn then weakened in the drive. SHOOTIN MONEY vied
for the lead from inside, chased the top pair around the turn and also weakened. CONTINENTAL UNION chased off the rail, bumped with outside rival at the
seven-sixteenths pole, went two to three wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
SYNTHESIS pressed from outside, collared rival around the far turn, dueled down the stretch and proved best in the late stages. TRUTH SEEKER stalked
outside a rival then between foes at the halfway point, came three wide into the stretch, angled out then rallied and edged SHORTLIST for second.
SHORTLIST settled off the pace, went two wide around the far turn, angled out in the stretch, rallied through the final furlong and missed the place.
OUTLAW set the pace inside, dueled around the second turn and down the lane, the yielded in deep stretch. BRONZE WARRIOR went three deep around
the first turn, chased four to five wide around the far turn and failed to respond when needed. LIONITE tucked inside early, saved ground into the lane and
flattened. WILSHIRE DUDE chased four deep through the first turn, outside a rival on the backstretch, four deep into the far turn then five wide into the lane
and weakened. RESPECT THE HUSTLE went four wide into the lane and was always outrun. MO BOB (IRE) raced outside a rival well off the pace, angled
to the rail on the backstretch, moved back out into the three path entering the stretch and was never a factor.

BECCA TAYLOR stalked from outside, raced four then three wide around the turn, rallied outside the leader, drew alongside with a sixteenth to go and
nailed rival at the wire. OMG IT'S JESSICA sped to the front from inside, led clear to the eighth pole, challenged inside the sixteenth pole and got nailed on
the line. ANOTHER EDDIE off a bit slow to begin, traveled mid-pack up the backstretch, entered the turn two wide then angled four wide leaving the bend,
kept to task in the drive and earned the show. OKOYE in range early outside the leader, chased two wide into the lane, lacked the needed late kick and lost
the show. SHANGHAI SUNRISE chased the pace from inside, came out into the drive and never rallied. STRAWBERRYONTOP chased off the rail, two to
three wide around the turn and weakened. MS MICHELLE lacked early speed, went two to three wide around the turn and made no impact. MISTY CAT off
a bit slow to begin, traveled four to five wide around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and was never a factor. SHOUT IT OUT raced mid-pack early on,
spun five wide off the turn and proved no menace. TESS'S WILD CAT stalked two wide leaving the backstretch, angled to the rail around the turn and
weakened.
