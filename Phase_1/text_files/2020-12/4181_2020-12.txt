Footnotes
PRINCESS ASYA broke sharp from the outside position then prompted the pace in the opening quarter, matched strides for the lead entering the turn,
gained the advantage approaching the three eighths pole, hustled up three wide into stretch run, stayed sharp in response and finished going away. GP'S
AMAZING GRACE was allowed to settle off the early speed through the backstretch then picked up the pace around the turn, was shaken up five wide for
the drive, showed response under pressure and steadily edged up closer to gain second best. TIC TOC TOCCET raced in the back through early stages
and continued reserved into the turn, hustled up along the outside into stretch run, sustained a steady six wide bid and prevailed for a share. DIAMOND
LEGACY hopped at the start then raced in tracking mode off the top trio, coaxed three wide past the quarter pole then evened out in the lane and got edged
late for show. I'MTHEBOSSRIGHTNOW held a slim lead through early going then raced on equal terms with the winner leaving the backstretch, got collared
for the lead three furlongs from home and steadily weakened. FASHION ROSE was forwardly placed from the get-go, was hustled up two wide around the
turn but could not advance and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
SALACIOUSACUSATION was allowed to settle in opening stages and raced five wide not too far off the early pace, given cue to advance and crept up
closer leaving the turn, swept by the pacesetter turning for home, quickly gained a clear advantage, drifted in briefly then straightened under left-handed
pressure and continued to pull away. GREATER GLORY raced four wide in range past the half mile marker, hustled along three wide around the turn,
sustained a steady bid into the lane and finished second best. UNEXPECTED STORM hopped at the start then sprinted out to the lead, continued to hold
firm still unasked at the quarter pole then got headed by the winner entering top stretch and steadily weakened. LYONAISSE raced three just off the second
flight nearing the half mild marker, was ridden along around the turn then chased on five wide in the lane but lacked the needed response for impact.
GOING RUNNING TOO positioned outside a foe a tracked the pacesetter to the turn, hustled up for response but failed to move on then faded. OKIE ZIPIT
chased the pace along the inside into stretch and had no late response. EATON'S BOOGIE lunged at the break, came away slowly, lost a lot of ground on
the field and failed to catch up.

Footnotes
SYKED UP was well placed sitting off the dueling duo through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid turning for home, gathered momentum under
steady pressure and kicked clear past the eighth pole. LADY ABIGAIL was away on top then quickly took on the challenge from IRISH CAPITAL, dueled
outside rival around the turn, dug in and took a slight edge in upper stretch then failed to be a match when the winner kicked by but stayed on with effort to
take place. IRISH CAPITAL quickly advanced after initial strides to challenge LADY ABIGAIL for the lead, dueled inside of rival around the turn, could not
maintain e2qaul terms for the top spot but stayed on with response and got edged late for place. ON THE BRIDGE raced near mid-range through early
stages, hustled along four wide around the turn then sustained a steady even bid through the lane but needed more for impact. POPFLY TWO SIX raced off
the early speed then hustled up along the rail around the turn, tipped out two to three wide in upper stretch but failed to move on. MUSTANG EDDIE raced
in the last, failed to advance when called upon leaving the backstretch then raced six wide through the lane and failed to factor.

Footnotes
COAL TRUTH raced two to three wide around the first turn then was allowed to settle down the backstretch, picked up the pace and headed in pursuit
around the far turn, swung five wide into stretch run, sustained a strong bid along the outside and kicked by late. ST. LOUIE GUY took over the lead
heading into the first turn and set the pace down the backstretch, continued to hold firm over challengers around the far turn, cut the corner entering the
lane, dueled for the lead with DON'T FORGET in the final furlong, fought back gamely along the rail then got edged out when the winner drove by late.
DON'T FORGET was unhurried through early stages then launched a two wide bid on the final turn, advanced to challenge ST. LOUIE GUY for the lead in
upper stretch, battled on two wide into final stages then lacked a closing kick. OFF SIXES raced three wide on the first turn then stalked down the
backstretch, lost position while unasked around the final turn, shifted out wider and given cue top of the lane, finished with interest but was too late for
impact. UNITED PATRIOT stalked the pace down the backstretch, hustled along three wide on the final turn then gave way in the lane.
CHOCOLATEICECREAM raced in range along the outside, loomed a threat at the quarter pole then failed to sustain bid into the lane.

Footnotes
CATSKILL GHOST vied for the lead racing inside of CONGRATS GIRL through the backstretch, began to edge away from rival while coming under attack
from WHATEVER COMES, roused for more and shook free to a clear advantage in upper stretch and stayed sharp under steady encouragement.
WHATEVER COMES rated through early stages then loomed three wide near the quarter pole, continued to put in a solid effort for the winner but could not
catch rival but finished clearly second best. IAMINTERESTING raced in the second flight between foes nearing the half mile marker, hustled up around the
turn then sustained a steady outside bid through the lane. BLUEGRASS DIXIE raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn then tipped out two to
three wide and lacked a needed rally. SAVE THE DAY raced off the pace,. saved ground and hustled along two wide but failed to threaten. HOME EARLY
SHIRLEY tracked the pace down the backstretch, hustled along for response around the turn but failed to move on. CONGRATS GIRL dueled along the
outside of the eventual winner to the three eighths pole then came up tired. NANA FAITH GLORY hopped awkwardly and got left at the start, trailed the field
and never got going. ROOMANTICS CHA CHA was not too far back in the opening quarter then steadily retreated.

STRUM M B was forwardly positioned around the first turn then stalked the leader down the backstretch, coaxed along the rail nearing the quarter pole, took
over the lead from NATIVE RIVER entering top stretch and drew off under steady encouragement. NATIVE RIVER led the way on the first turn and set the
pace down the backstretch, continued on top over edging up STRUM MB near the quarter pole, got collared by the winner turning for home but ran on to
clear second best. POPPY'S OATS settled nicely while rated off the pace through early stages, hustled along four to five wide into the stretch run and
continued a steady even effort to best the rest. OKLAHOMA LINE stalked the leader down the backstretch, hustled along three wide around the far turn but
had no kick left in reserve and gave way. REAL EASY raced off the pace but was not too far back through early stages then came empty entering the far
turn and steadily retreated.

TOUCHING RAINBOWS took over the lead after initial strides and set a sharp opening quarter, continued to lead the way while still unleashed going by the
quarter pole, roused for more at the top of the lane, stayed on two wide under strong handling then held on late over fast-charging SENOR BLAIR. SENOR
BLAIR settled through early stages while not too far back then only showed mild response while ridden along around the turn, swung into action along the
outside entering the top of the lane, gathered sharp momentum under steady pressure, surged to the wire and just missed. LARCH raced off the early pace
then given cue turning for home, came under a left-handed drive, found more in reserve and rallied up tp take a share. U S SPECIAL FORCES was
forwardly placed out of the gate and chased after the quick pacesetter into the turn, dropped to the inside and cut the corner entering top stretch then
evened out in the final furlong. FOXRUN reared in the air at the start and lost a lot of ground, trailed far back in early stages, saved ground and showed
response along the rail in stretch but could not overcome poor start. BARRY LEE tracked in good position in range of the early lead, headed in pursuit of the
leader mid-way around the turn, ran on into stretch then flattened in the final furlong. TALE OF A STORM raced in contention and chased along the inside
into the turn then failed to keep pace and faded.

Footnotes
DIXIE MO was forwardly placed around the first turn then settled in good position and stalked the pacesetter to the far turn, moved up to challenge
UPGRADE ME nearing the quarter pole, was put to a drive turning for home, took over the lead in upper stretch and kept clear. DUTCH TREAT was
allowed to settle out of the gate and raced two to three wide heading into the first turn, raced off the top flight through early stages then picked up the pace
around the far turn, sustained a steady effort through the lane and got up late for second best. COME ON SWEET PEA saved ground near the inside
around the first turn then tracked the pace to the far turn, continued unleashed racing in hand going by the quarter pole then tipped out a couple paths wider
and headed in pursuit entering top stretch, sustained a steady bid through the lane and prevailed for a share. UPGRADE ME hustled up out of the gate and
led the way around the first turn, remained near the inside and set the pace to the far turn, roused for more when challenged by the winner near the quarter
pole, got collared for the lead entering top stretch then gave way. BEAUTY DAY was forwardly positioned through early stages then failed to sustain bid
after the half mile marker and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
SHWEET PERSUASION broke on top and lead the way on the first turn and remained clear and nicely settled on top through the backstretch, held firm over
pursuers around the far turn then roused for more entering the lane, drifted out wider under right-handed encouragement and had enough left in reserve to
hold firm. HUMOR CONTROLLER raced four wide around the first turn then settled off the second flight through the backstretch, picked up the pace and
hustled along two wide into the drive and sustained a steady effort through the lane and edged out foe for place. DAK DA MAN stalked the pacesetter
through early stages, launched a bid along the rail; on the far turn, cut the corner into the drive, fought back for position along the rail and narrowly missed
second best. SOMETHING SUPER raced in early contention and tracked the pacesetter to the far turn, headed in pursuit and edged up closer on the
quarter pole, stayed on three wide into the lane then evened out in the final furlong. RYDER ROCKET raced in range along the outside through the
backstretch, continued in contention around the far turn then failed to sustain bid in the lane.
