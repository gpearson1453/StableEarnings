Footnotes
LANG'S FIR DOLL dueled from the inside early, gained a clear margin through the turn, widen the effort at the eighth pole and was well clear while under
steady urging. WICKED FITZ well placed from the outside, advanced through the turn, remained forward but was no match for the winner while lasting for
the place. JOE DIVER chased the early pace from the outside, responded entering the drive and closed with a rush for the show. SNOWBLIND forced the
early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded but just missed the show. UNDERDOG forced the early pace outside but had
nothing left. MAIL MAN JOHNNY pressed the early pace inside but came up empty in the drive. BREGMAN chased the early pace and faded. BASSETT
was never a factor. SPEEDY LUIS was never close. PICTURE PAYNTER had a steady fade.

COULD YOU broke sharp from between foes to quickly gain the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the
second turn, continued to be clear at the eighth pole and held sway. LAURIEANN chased the early pace from the outside, inched closer entering the turn,
responded when asked and was getting to the winner late. BELLA FALAYA pressed the early pace from the inside, remained forward for the drive but could
only hold position. HOYAM forced the early pace outside, remained forward but had nothing for the drive. JET SWEEP went evenly. PANTERITA could only
pass tired ones. SANTA ANA WINDS was no factor. HURRICANE TIZWAY had a steady fade. SEASIDE SURPRISE was always outrun.
