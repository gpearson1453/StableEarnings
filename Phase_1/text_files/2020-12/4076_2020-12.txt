the pacesetter, stepped onto the far, was still being held in reserve moving to the front end when ready somewhere midway on the far turn, settled into
upper stretch and was given its cue. held on well to stay in the clear. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME bumped at the start, was mostly three wide in pursuit of the
front runners, kept pace on the second bend after being let out a notch at the half mile pole, spun into the stretch under much stronger handling, got staved
off. THEITALIANAMERICAN chased the pace three wide, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, went on to secure the show. LORENZEN
along the inside, never made his presence felt. TIZME BOBBY MCGEE established the top by the end of the homestretch despite being bumped from
between foes at the start, was well rated showing the way early on an open lead, proved no match when challenged by the winner in the general area of the
three-eighths pole, did a steady fade after relinquishing. UNCLE NED rode the rail, failed to respond when asked to pick it up at the half mile pole. HEIGHT
bumped at the start, had no rally after undergoing a two wide until the quarter pole. ACROSS THE CHANNEL took up the chase two wide until the quarter
pole, tired. VRIODINI strung out three until the top of the lane, failed to contend. Fog blurred the viewing of the race.

Footnotes
Through a brief lifting of the fog, SCUTTLEBUZZ got bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way, chased three then four wide from near the
rear of the field coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out eight wide into upper stretch, offered up a good kick to close stoutly through the final
furlong and was up in the final jump to score. FRAT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside down the backstretch and then from the
two path through the turn shaking away nearing the quarter pole, got roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to the
eighth pole, dug in under growing lone threat and was nailed in the very last jump to the wire. TERCERO broke out at the start bumping SCUTTLEBUZZ in
concert with BRICCO who came inwards, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a
mild kick to secure the show honors. FREUDIAN ANALYST chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild bid passing tired rivals through to the finish. PERFECT BANKER chased just off the inside from just off the pace coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, weakened in the stretch. BRICCO got brushed at the start when OBSESSION'S EMPIRE broke
inwards and in turn bumped SCUTTLEBUZZ, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. HAY
LAD led briefly after the start before chasing two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into
upper stretch and tired. OBSESSION'S EMPIRE broke in at the start brushing BRICCO, chased four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five
to six wide into upper stretch and tired. HERE COMES MEG chased along the inside forwardly placed, came under a ride five-sixteenths from home, cut the
corner into upper stretch and faltered. MICROGOLDEN chased just off the inside from the tail of the field, tucked to the rail at the half mile pole, got coaxed
along at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed.

way, attended by the winner from the outside, was set down turning into the stretch, engaged the top one from midstretch to final seventy yards, weakened
into the show slot. SCILLY CAY strung out three to four wide on the turn, fanned out into path five from upper to midlane, venturing onward as the widest of
all, lacked the needed headway. WOW BROWN underwent a three wide pursuit, had no stretch response. BRONX BOMBER taken hold after stumbling
badly at the start, took the inside route on the turn, swung out three wide into the lane, failed to gain. CALL ME HARRY gathered after breaking slightly to
the outside, got guided over to the rail, went on to save ground to no avail.

Footnotes
Through thick fog, LIDO KEY raced two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, took over command a furlong from home, dug in tussling with GIGGLE
FACTORY to the finish gamely and prevailed on the wire. GIGGLE FACTORY coaxed from the gate, tracked along the inside, dug in under a drive in
contention through the final furlong fighting on to the finish but was ultimately repelled. MIRABELL MEI just off the inside near the rear of the field, closed
well to secure the show honors. KEMBA just off the pace two to three wide in pursuit, weakened in the late stages. APPRECIATE saved ground in pursuit
from mid pack, improved position through the stretch. R V TREASURE saved ground near the rear of the field and passed tired rivals. MARQUET LEGACY
saved ground in pursuit from near the rear of the field and offered no response. TRADEABLE showed the way along the inside, yielded the front in upper
stretch approaching the eighth pole and weakened. ALLEY TO CALVARY chased just off the pace two to three wide, tired. MINIT MAUS coaxed from the
gate, raced three then two wide in closest aim of the leader and tired. SYZYGY three wide near the rear of the field, made no impact.

Footnotes
BOWING SNOWMAN sparred for command from the two path, inched up to the leader as the second split was being finalized, was put to a drive, emerged
as the eighth pole as the new leader, dug in well to hold sway. WHAT'S MY CATEGORY tracked the pacesetter from the inside route, slipped to the outside
crossing midpoint on the turn, was under a ride angling three wide into the stretch, failed to lasso in the winner, stayed on for the place. WRITER'S
REGRET maintained the advantage after getting away to a sharp beginning, was along the rail carving out the pace, with the winner in accompaniment from
the outside, got roused being put to the test by the aforementioned foe, relinquished then weakened into the show slot. OLIVER'S FORTUNE saved ground
for nearly a half, stepped into the lane and went on to finish a non-threatening fouirth. BOO WHO took up the chase three wide on the turn, commenced the
stretch one path farther off the rail, got outfinished. GIRAMONTE sighted two wide in midpack on the turn, had no rally. REUNION TOUR two wide onto the
turn, came up empty. POLPIS spotted along the rail by the turn, launched no bids. STONE CRAZED stepped into the turn from path two, never made its
presence felt. OUT OF TUNE displayed no speed. SCOTTO saved ground on the turn to no avail, Dense fog covered the track, blurring the viewing of the
race.

kept to task to prevail. PIER FORTY got squeezed back between foes after the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths advancing
through the latter portion of the turn, went six wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. DOUBLE SHOT bumped at the start by WILD
BANKER who broke outwards, chased three then two wide from near the rear, spun just off the inside for home and kept on for the show honors. WILD
BANKER broke out at the start bumping DOUBLE SHOT, saved ground near the rear of the field, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild
kick. LIAM'S FIRE crossed to the two path and showed the way, angled three wide into upper stretch, yielded the front and weakened in the late stages.
BETA four wide in aim of the front, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened. ELUSIVE RULER bobbled at the start, raced four wide forwardly placed,
continued four wide for home and tired. DUBLIN GREEN chased just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, continued just off the inside into upper stretch
and tired. GENERALONAMISSION chased along the inside, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
OUR LAST BUCK sparred for command from the two path, got cued up issuing a challenge turning into the lane, emerged by the eighth pole as the new
leader, dug in late to preserve the decision. WILL SING FOR WINE appeared one-paced bringing up the back of the pack while taking the inside route, cut
the corner into the stretch, tipped to the outside, gradually getting worked into path four by the sixteenth pole, took off with strong energy to garner the place.
STRIKING SPEED sat within striking distance two wide, swung out slightly wider for the drive home, finished with willingness for third. TWELTH MAN saved
ground early, angled out springing from the five-sixteenths pole, narrowed in for the last major check. VILLAINOUS three wide onto the turn, lacked the
necessary response. SINGAPORE TRADER disputed the pace towards the inside route until upper stretch, faltered. DUDLEY SQUARE forwardly placed
four wide, gave way. HEIRLOOM KITTEN loosely pocketed, came up empty. FAMILY BIZ sighted two wide at the top of the turn, had no rally. BLINDWILLIE
MCTELL stalked the pace three wide, stepped into the lane and folded. AMERICAN RULE three wide departing the backstretch, launched no bids.
VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD hung out four wide on the turn, was under a ride going one wider into the stretch, backed away. Dense fog obscured the viewing
of the race.

BANKIT three then two wide in pursuit, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, edged clear
under a drive to prevail. MR. BUFF got bumped at the start by CITY MAN and was pinched back against DANNY CALIFORNIA, came under light coaxing
and advanced three wide through the first turn, dueled in hand three to four paths off the inside with SEA FOAM to his inside, tucked to the two path through
the far turn taking narrow command inside the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home roused for the drive, dug in and was collared nearing the
eighth pole, kept on clear of the rest for the place honors. YANKEE DIVISION chased two to three wide coming under urging at the seven-sixteenths, swung
three to four wide into upper stretch, improved position for the show honors. SEA FOAM led early on along the inside before dueling in hand from the two
path with MR. BUFF to his outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing seven-sixteenths from home, got headed inside the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. DANNY CALIFORNIA hustled from the gate, raced four then three wide through the first turn

start and was reloaded, broke out at the start bumping and pinching back MR. BUFF, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED JOHN nailed down the advantage after the break, cut over to the inside early on the backstretch, showed the way, attended by RINGGOOD
from the outside, arrived at the three-sixteenths pole and had the pilot go to work, shook off the previously-mentioned foe's tepid bid, then held late to
preserve the decision. TRUE PALACE loped along two to three wide for nearly three-quarters, got sent to the outside entering the stretch, completed the
maneuver in the neighborhood of the six path, gained ground in a steadfast manner en route for the place. Z'FINALE bumped with PRINCE HALO shortly
after the start, recovered and went on to take up the chase from the two path, got set down approaching the five-sixteenths pole, angled five wide into the
lane, chipped away at the deficit earning the show award. RINGGOOD prompted the winner from the two path, put together an abbreviated bid in the vicinity
of the three-sixteenths pole, saw it fizzle out, weakened late. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE bobbled as the field was sent off and running, took up position in
midpack, departed the backstretch towards the two path, angled four wide for the stretch, made no headway in the final furlong. LIQUOR three wide onto
the turn, was in the same path spinning into the stretch, backed away. DAITHI off the inside, travelled three wide on the turn, was gradually worked into path
six down the lane to no avail. BRICKYARD chased the pace primarily from the two path, slithered over to the rail in time to cut the corner into the stretch,
faltered. STORM ALFEET sighted in path two near the rear of the field, got moved out five wide for the stretch run, never made its presence felt. OLIVER
WITHA TWIST strung out four wide on the turn, was in the same path coming into the stretch, had no rally. BIELEFELD three wide leaving the three-eighths
pole, was never in it. APEX PREDATOR tracked the pace from just off the rail, was in path two for the stretch drive, tired. YOUSAIDHELLO rode the rail
until the quarter pole, never reached a contending position. PRINCE HALO made contact with Z'FINALE a few strides into the contest, was guided onto the
inside route, took it until the end of the bend, tipped out two wide entering the stretch, gave out.
