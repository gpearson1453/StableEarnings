Footnotes
CANDYGRAMFORMONGO stalked the early pace, moved up around the far turn to challenge the leaders, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and
finished well to get up under strong handling. TO THE FRONT showed good early speed from the inside, dug in nearing the sixteenth pole but couldn't
match strides with the winner late to finish second best. FEDERALE stalked the pace, saved ground through the far turn into the lane, angled four wide
through the drive and finished willingly to the wire. EXTRA MEDIUM settled off the early pace, raced four wide nearing the eighth pole and gained ground in
the latter stages. BACKWOODS BOOGIE was slow early, raced six wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. BRIDOLOGIST settled to the middle of
pack down the backstretch, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. D C FIREMAN pressed the pace while racing between rivals and
tired.

Footnotes
TOM TERRIFIC tracked the leader down the backstretch while racing two wide, gained command through the far turn and held gamely in the drive while
racing just off the inside under strong pressure. MARTINI LANE was unhurried early, moved up five wide at the eighth pole and closed in well in the final
stages. FUGITIVE stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, moved up four wide at the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive.
CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY was slow early, raced four wide through the stretch and had no late rally. OFF THE RECORD was quick to begin to set all the
pace and gave way. TWINSTINCT stumbled badly at the break raced towards the back of the pack and failed to have a response. KABOB stalked the pace,
was pulled up entering the upper stretch after being injured and had to be vanned off.

MALIBU BEAUTY stalked the early pace, moved up five wide nearing the eighth pole and finished well to get up under strong encouragement. NOT ON MY
WATCH stalked early on, moved up four wide at the three sixteenths pole, led late but couldn't hold off the winner to finished second best.
KEEPYOURSKATESON was unhurried early, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and showed late interest. FEARLESS LASSIE broke in, bumped
with rival, raced towards the back of the pack early, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and never was a serious threat. SICK PACK SARA set all the
pace from the outside and gave way in the drive. CHARGINA was bumped at the break, raced four deep through the lane and had no response. IN VAIN
stalked the pace along the inside and faded. SEE THAT GIRL dropped back early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DESBORDES set all the pace, raced just off the inside down the backstretch and prevailed late under all out pressure. ORTINOLA was allowed to settle
early, angled four wide through the stretch, surged late and just missed. CAIRO QUEEN stalked the pace, raced along the inside down the backstretch,
moved up five wide at the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire. COMPLETE SURPRISE pressed the pace from the inside and weakened late.
BROAD STORM was slow early on, moved up seven wide into the upper stretch and had not enough late. MY QUEEN MICHELLE bobbled break, stalked
the pace, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. ONE SLICK CHICK was off slowly, raced five deep at the eighth pole and
never threatened. VIBRANCY failed to sustain a bid.
