nearing the quarter pole and gained ground mildly on the outside while drifting out some in the stretch. MIND TRAPPE raced in the middle of the pack on
the outside, navigated the turn from the two path and finished evenly but was outkicked late. STORMY PACIFIC raced off the pace up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. IOWA NATIVE chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and faded in the stretch. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY trailed the field up the backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch from the two

Footnotes
SHE'S MY RIDE tracked the leading line, saved ground through the turn, continued to race behind the leading flight in upper stretch, was taken three wide
approaching midstretch, joined the leading flight past the eighth pole, and took over in the final sixteenth. DOUBLE DAWN broke slightly outward and
bumped THUNDER ISLAND in the opening strides, pressed the pace between horses, dueled outside of RUBY ROUND HERE from the three eighths to the
furlong mark, continued to fight inside of SHE'S MY RIDE to the sixteenth, and proved no match from there. CREAL SUGAR veered almost all the way to
the outside fence in the opening strides, soon trailed, advanced three wide into the turn, rallied three wide around the bend, and sustained that rally seven to
eight wide in the lane. RUBY ROUND HERE set a pressured pace early, dueled inside of DOUBLE DAWN from the three eighths to the furlong mark, and
weakened in the final furlong. ABBMAR attended the pace three wide, was pushed along three wide into the turn to keep pace, came four wide into the lane,
and flattened out. SHE'S WANDAFUL hopped at the start, chased three wide on the backstretch, continued in the three to four path on the turn, chased on
four to five wide in the lane but lacked the needed kick. LINDALOUIMAGE bobbled out of the gate, settled at the rear of the main group early, raced in the
three path between horses toward the rear on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, and proved no threat. BULU chased between horses, began to
flatten in the three path from near the three eighths, and came up empty in the lane. UNIVERSIADE settled near the rear, trailed in the two to three path on
the turn, swung out into the lane, and had no rally seven wide. THUNDER ISLAND was lightly bumped by DOUBLE DAWN in the opening strides, settled
inside, was driven in the two path on the turn, and weakened in the two path in the lane.

EASTER MUSIC hit the gate and brushed with the horse to his outside at the break, settled in to race in the middle of the pack on the outside up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, began an outside bid approaching the three sixteenths pole and continued to gain ground on the
outside to pull ahead late. ONE WAY HOME brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, chased the leader on the outside up what remained of the
backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, moved up to duel for the lead the length of the stretch and was caught late. DOM THE BOMB bobbled
slightly leaving the gate, was hustled to an early lead, saved ground around the turn, dueled for the lead from the rail down the lane and was caught late.
BIG SPORT raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, made a mild bid entering the stretch and finished
evenly while showing no real kick. STORMINSIDE was reluctant to load, raced off the pace early, navigated the turn from the two path and improved
position on the outside in late stretch. ELUSIVE FORCE dropped back to trail the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, and drifted out
while gaining some ground in late stretch. GREELEYS ICE chased the leader between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around
the turn and weakened in the stretch. RIPE ATTACK pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, moved up to
launch a bid passing the five sixteenths pole and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
GAMBLER'S FALLACY settled near the rear inside, steered out approaching the turn into the backstretch to avoid an injured foe, remained well settled
down the backstretch, began to improve inside approaching the far turn, rallied between horses on the far turn, came four wide into upper stretch, was
forced further out by IHADADREAM in upper stretch, nonetheless found his best in the final furlong and got up in time. IHADADREAM chased the leading
trio inside of MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH through the clubhouse turn, chased the leading pair down the backstretch, came three wide into the far turn as the field
condensed, bid outside of HURRICANE JAKE near the three eighths, drove to the lead in upper stretch while drifting out, opened up a defined lead to
midstretch, but was caught late. GALINDO settled at the rear on the first turn, improved position into the backstretch, drew closer past the nine sixteenths,
was taken inside into the far turn and improved further, was urged for a rally inside of HURRICANE JAKE in upper stretch, found himself outkicked by
IHADADREAM, kept on willingly but was ultimately outfinished. HURRICANE JAKE was sent for pace, cleared to secure the inside leading spot into the
clubhouse turn, took pressure around that turn, cleared again into the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, was confronted near the three eighths,
vied into the lane, but weakened approaching midstretch. TORNADO BOY chased toward the rear on the far turn, settled in the rear flight down the
backstretch, was relegated to the rear near the nine sixteenths, went to a drive in the three to four path on the second turn, and passed tiring horses. B
SALTY prompted the pace three wide on the first turn, tracked the leader down the backstretch, race into the far turn between horses in the tracking flight as
the field took closer order, began to flatten two wide near the three eighths and continued to weaken in the lane. MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH chased the leading
trio outside of IHADADREAM through the clubhouse turn, steered outside to avoid an injured horse near the thirteen sixteenths, continued to chase down
the backstretch, began to weaken four wide on the far turn and had nothing further for the drive. AND HE'S LOOSE raced keen into the first turn, pulled
ahead to press the pace between horses, took a bad step past the seven eighths, pulled up, and was humanely euthanized on track.

Footnotes
COLONEL KLINK chased outside of AMERICAN HERITAGE early, was pushed along and responded with a rally in the four path on the turn, was taken out
into upper stretch, continued his improvement five to six wide in the lane, and got up in the final fifty yards. BUTTERED NOODLES prompted the pace three
wide past the five eighths, continued to press in the three path on the turn, sustained his pursuit of the leader into the lane despite losing some ground on
him in upper stretch, encroached again past midstretch but did not get past him until the final strides, after COLONEL KLINK had passed them both. HURTS
SO GOOD broke sharply, took pace pressure past the five eighths, saved ground while setting a pressured pace around the turn, inched to a better defined
lead in upper stretch, dug in when challenged past midstretch, was headed by COLONEL KLINK near fifty yards out and lost the place in the final strides.
MIAS MOONBEAM settled at the rear, trailed in the three to four path on the turn, swung out seven wide into upper stretch while driven, found his best in
the final sixteenth and rallied belatedly. EL ASESINO raced midpack early, was pushed along near the five eighths to press the pace between horses could
not keep up with the leading pair past the seven sixteenths, tracked in the two path around the rest of the bend, was outkicked by the leading flight into the
lane, but kept on willingly inside foes. TRAPPE VALLEY settled inside behind the leading trio, tracked them in the three path on the turn, was driven three
wide in upper stretch, loomed near the furlong marker, and flattened out late. MEXICO MEMORIES settled near the rear outside of STALLONE, chased
three wide on the turn, was driven from near the five sixteenths, and took mildly closer order late. STALLONE settled near the rear inside of MEXICO
MEMORIES, raced toward the rear between horses in the three to four path on the turn, took mildly closer order in upper stretch and ran evenly late.
AMERICAN HERITAGE chased inside of COLONEL KLINK early, began to flatten out in the two path on the turn, and proved empty in the three path in the
stretch.

Footnotes
BAROQUE saved ground around the first turn, chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail passing the three eighths pole,
kicked clear entering the stretch and continued to draw off under a drive down the lane. HAMAZING VISION hit the gate leaving it, raced in the two path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, angled in to save ground around the far turn and gained ground in late stretch.
PENTIMENTO saved ground around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, continued to save ground around the far
turn and chased the eventual winner home the best of the rest. SPLASH FOR GOLD raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the frontrunners
on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path around the far turn and finished evenly on the rail. SERTOMAN raced around
the first turn in the four path, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began to move up headed into the far turn, entered the
stretch from the three path, and was outkicked while drifting out in late stretch. DOMIKATE raced off the pace in the two path through the opening half mile,
began to move up from the two path around the far turn and continued to pass tiring horses in the stretch. PLEASANT MOON dueled for the lead from the
three path around the first turn, moved up to lead outright for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and weakened in the final
furlong. ANTRIM'S GIANT raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch between horses in the middle of the back, came around
the far turn in the two path and flattened out in the stretch. BAHNKE raced in the three path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of
the pack, entered the stretch from the five path and was empty from there. BEST YOU EVER SEEN dueled for the lead from the two path around the first
turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back around the far turn and continued to tire from there. CHIEF OAKIE DOKIE raced in the two path around the
first turn, dropped back to trail the field up the backstretch and around the far turn, entered the stretch from the three path and was never a factor.

JETS A GINNIN was sent for pace, raced clear in the two path on the turn, went to a drive near the three sixteenths, kept on clear in the two path past
midstretch, and held. FULL OF GRACE came out in the opening strides and grazed GHAALEB THE GREAT, settled midpack down the backstretch and in
the two to three path on the turn, was taken five wide into upper stretch and driven, responded with a rally, gradually drifted in while continuing to improve,
and missed. GHAALEB THE GREAT broke awkwardly and was then bumped between horses in the opening strides, regained touch with the pack near the
five eighths, kept on toward the rear in the three path on the turn, was taken five wide in upper stretch, and rallied under a drive. SENSE OF SELF settled
toward the rear early, was relegate to a lone last past the five eighths, lost further ground into the turn, began to take closer order in the four path past the
three eighths, was taken seven wide into the lane, and rallied past tiring horses. MEEKA attended the pace inside of JETS A GINNIN in the opening furlong,
tracked the pace inside of HAMMERED from there, continued at the inside of the tracking flight while hugging the rail on the turn, went to a drive two wide in
upper stretch, and weakened. COWGIRL KIMMIE broke slightly inward and bumped GHAALEB THE GREAT, settled toward the rear three wide, was
pushed along in the five path on the turn, and mustered no rally. SHE'S DIVINE chased outside of HAMMERED on the backstretch, improved to race three
wide in the tracking flight on the turn, came four wide into upper stretch, and weakened. HAMMERED was fractious in the gate, tracked the leading pair
early, raced between horses in the tracking flight on the turn, was driven three wide between horses in upper stretch and emptied out.
