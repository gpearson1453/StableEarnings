Footnotes
SHE'S A DIME unhurried in the opening stages, angled four wide into the stretch, flew late and inhaled rival to get up in time. CA DREAMER sped clear
from outside, drew away around the turn, carried a comfortable lead to the eighth pole, led through the final sixteenth and got nailed in the final moments.
SWEET RAFAELA tracked off the inside, went three wide around the turn, lacked a serious bid and stayed on to secure the show. DR WYSONG raced near
the inside, moved out into the two path around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch, angled inside approaching the furlong grounds and showed a mild rally.
ETERNAL ENDEAVOUR (GB) trailed the field into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the lane and improved position. UNO TROUBLE MAKER
stalked the pace from inside, two wide into the stretch and flattened out. SHEZA FACTOR unhurried in the beginning, angled to the inside, saved ground to
the stretch and failed to respond when asked. PREMIERE LADY chased outside a rival, two to three wide around the turn, tired in the stretch, eased late
and walked off.

Footnotes
BEDROCK came away awkwardly, raced up close in the two path into the turn, bid three deep around the bend, vied with a pair of rivals down the stretch
and proved best late. CARPE VICTORIAM stumbled leaving the gate, sent for the lead, vied between rivals leaving the turn and into the stretch, battled into
the furlong grounds and yielded grudgingly to the winner. SEE THROUGH IT stumbled and was pinballed at the start, recovered quickly and went for the
front, vied for command into the stretch and down the lane and got outfinished by the top pair. HIDDEN PROMISE tracked off the inside, two to three wide
around the turn and finished well. HYDROGEN stumbled a bit and got bumped at the start, dropped back early and was never a factor. VEGAS MOON
bumped both sides leaving the gate, raced along the inside into the turn, angled out around the bend and never threatened. ACTIVE PASS broke in and
bumped rival at the start, took the turn three wide and lacked a rally. STAY LEGENDARY attended the pace from outside, cut inside at the five-sixteenths
pole then faded out of contention.

four wide around the bend, rallied and got up for the show. BOB DANIELS chased three wide then two wide on the turn and went evenly through the final
furlong. PROUD MUSKET stalked off the inside, angled to the fence around the turn and could not rally. PLAYING HARDBALL broke in and bumped rival at
the start, set the pace with rival to the outside, headed at the three-eighths pole, fought back inside to upper stretch and weakened. GALLANT GUY trailed
the field early, went three wide around the turn and was always outrun. HABANERO KID chased four wide to the stretch and weakened. BRAVESTONE
bumped leaving the gate, took the turn two to three wide and had little left for the late stages.

Footnotes
SPIELBERG stalked off the rail through the early stages, took closer order leaving the backstretch, chased two to three wide into the stretch, put in a late bid
outside THE GREAT ONE, dug in and won the head bob at the wire. THE GREAT ONE sped to the front to set the pace, pressured from the outside
seven-sixteenths, kicked away around the far turn, remained clear to the sixteenth pole, challenged by the winner in the closing moments and got
outnodded. PETRUCHIO tucked inside on the first turn, tracked two wide then angled out around the final bend and kept on to gain the show. RED FLAG
stalked the pace from inside, angled out into the stretch and weakened. WESTON broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, showed a mild bid at the
seven-sixteenths, dropped back around the far turn and tired. POSITIVITY stumbled and got bumped leaving the gate, raced off the pace and off the inside,
went three wide into the lane and never threatened. HALF-MILE FRACTION HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
RESPECTFULLY dueled with DECORATE to the turn, cleared rival around the bend, showed the way three wide into the stretch and widened in the final
furlong. KATE BOSS tracked three deep early, roused two wide around the turn, moved into second at the top of the lane but could not make an impact on
the winner. BEST OF SHOW unhurried in the early going, advanced four to five wide around the turn and churned on for a clear third. FELICIDAD LEGADA
off slow and veered in at the start, chased along the inside then two wide into the stretch and never threatened. NURSE HARDBODY tracked three wide
around the turn and never rallied. MESA STAR up close early behind the top pair, chased outside a rival around the bend, angled four wide into the stretch
and faded. OLBIA chased between rivals early, outside a foe or two wide into the turn, three wide into the stretch and had little left. DECORATE dueled for
the lead up the backstretch and into the turn, could not match the leader around the turn, chased into the drive and tired. BIG HOOCHIE MAMA shuffled
back at the start, saved ground and was never a factor.

Footnotes
GOV FROM ABOVE broke in and bumped rival at the start, settled off the pace, went four wide into the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch, rallied
through the lane then lugged in past mid-stretch and drew clear. TIGER'S SONG raced off the pace, angled five wide into the stretch, came out further at
the top of the lane, rallied and earned the place honors. MOOGIE CAT dueled outside a rival for the lead, cleared into the stretch, drew away in the lane
then flattened in the final furlong and could not offer resistance to the top pair. ARRIVEDERCI ROMA stalked outside the top pair, angled to the two path
into the turn, floated out by rival leaving the turn and entered the stretch five wide, stayed in range through the drive, bothered by the winner past the eighth
pole and kept on for a minor award. WILD CAT CANYON tracked three wide into the turn, floated six wide into the lane, angled inside a rival in upper stretch
and failed to find more. LUCKY RYAN SEVEN bumped at the start, stalked the pace from inside, drifted out into the stretch and flattened late. MR. CLUTCH
turned head and was off slow to begin, went two wide into the stretch and proved no menace. BATTLING GERVINHO dueled for the lead from inside into
and around the turn then gave way in the stretch. LUGIA off slow to begin, saved ground into the lane and was never a factor. THE RIDER ABOARD
ARRIVEDERCI ROMA LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST EVENTUAL WINNER GOV FROM ABOVE, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE PAST THE
EIGHTH POLE. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THE INCIDENT BETWEEN THE RUNNERS WAS MINOR AND HAD NO BEARING ON
THE OUTCOME OF THE RACE AND WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER FINISH. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
YELLOW DRESS up close just outside the leader then dropped back into a stalking position, angled to the rail entering the turn, stayed inside then swung
out into the stretch, closed in outside REIGN OF FIRE and wore down the runner-up in deep stretch. REIGN OF FIRE broke out and bumped rival, chased
from outside, challenged three wide around the turn and into the stretch, took control at the top of the lane, cleared at the three-sixteenths pole but got
outfinished in the final sixteenth. DANCING DANA settled early, went three wide into the turn, angled five wide into the stretch, finished willingly but lacked
the needed late punch. RISEN LADY tracked the pace from inside, angled out on the turn then further out entering the stretch, then summoned a mid rally to
earn a minor award. DO YOU HEAR THAT stalked the leader up the backstretch, bid outside into the turn, vied between rivals to the stretch, relinquished
the lead at the top of the lane and weakened. RUTHIES RACER bumped at the start, saved ground into the stretch and failed to rally. BIG MAMA SUE
lacked early speed, traveled four to five wide around the turn then angled in at the top of the lane and passed tired rivals. EXCHANGE VOWS bumped at
the start, took the turn four wide and weakened. MALIBU MISTRESS bumped both sides at the start, traveled outside a rival, two to three wide around the
turn and never threatened. PAINT ME AGAIN broke in and bumped rival, sped to the front and set the pace up the backstretch, vied for command through
the turn and into the stretch, then gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MASTER RECOVERY bumped twice leaving the gate, chased two wide around the first turn, went up to take command early on the backstretch then
cleared inside rival, showed the way along the inside then in the two path entering the stretch and drew off. TWIRLING DERBY went five deep around the
first turn, raced off the rail in range on the backstretch, two wide leaving the far turn, tipped out and went outside a pair of rivals in the stretch and bested the
rest. SEICHE raced three deep around the first turn, chased off the inside then angled to the rail entering the far turn, saved ground into the stretch, asked in
the drive, could not summon the needed late kick and held the show. QUESTION AUTHORITY raced four deep around the first turn, chased outside a rival
or two wide into the stretch and flattened in the final furlong. GAMBINI tracked the pace from inside, angled out and went three wide into the drive and
weakened. NOBLE PURSUIT tucked inside on the first turn, stayed inside then angled around weakening rival entering the far turn, exited that bend three
wide and never made an impact. FORT DODGE raced three wide into the first turn, four wide into the stretch and was never a factor. MY LUCKY BID off
slow, broke out and bumped rival at the start, was hard to ride into the first turn, steered off the inside and remained off the rail into the stretch and came up
empty. ASSET hard to load prior to the start, broke out, went six deep into the first turn then angled in some leaving the bend, tracked two wide into the
stretch and faded. EL MAS PODEROSO broke out and bumped rival at the start and recovered quickly to take control, led through the first turn then lost
command early on the backstretch, chased rival then dropped back leaving the backstretch, eased around the far turn and down the stretch, eventually
crossed the wire and walked off.
