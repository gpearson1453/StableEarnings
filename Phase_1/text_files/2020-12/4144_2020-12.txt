Footnotes
STRIKE THE TOP vied for command between foes from the outset, edged clear leaving the three furlong marker, held sway into upper stretch while being
kept to pressure widening the advantage and was taken in hand approaching the wire. HE'S ROYALTY joined the pace four wide in the opening stages,
continued in pursuit of the winner in that path to upper stretch but faded late while lasting for the place honors. TINKER'S PAL, off last, was settled along the
inside on the backstretch, gathered some momentum leaving the turn to split foes three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to gain
position to the end. FLORIDA TWO STEP was rated outside the first flight from just out of striking distance on the backstretch, was prompted to advance
while being fanned five wide racing into the lane and continued with an even effort. HIMELSTEIN bobbled at the start, then dropped out of close quarters
early to track off the first flight, was prompted between foes racing into the turn to briefly gain position nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. DENY,
urged three wide between foes prompting the pace, steadily faded nearing the lane. EXCELLENT MARK, urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the
backstretch into the turn, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
FOXY MISCHIEF came through close quarters at the break to track off the first flight while angling to the inside, shifted out three wide racing into the bend
to bid for command between rivals, was floated wide in the stretch by ITALIAN JUSTICE while disputing the issue but wrested the advantage from that rival
in time under firm right handed pressure. The latter broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival through the backstretch, edged forward to a narrow
advantage racing into the turn, shifted out resisting the winner's bid grudgingly through the stretch but couldn't contain that foe late. FIELD LETTERS,
unhurried along the inside racing to the turn, gained momentum splitting rivals just off the inside racing into upper stretch and continued willingly nearest the
rail to close the gap while just outkicked by the top pair. TEE EM EYE settled last racing well off the inside to the turn, angled five wide racing into upper
stretch and continued to make some mild progress. STARSHIP REINA tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening three furlongs, was prompted
to advance in tandem with the eventual winner while being fanned four wide nearing upper stretch and gave way racing into the lane.
FIFTYSHADESOGRAYCE, urged from the break along the inside disputing the pace to the turn, gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
MAGICAL TALE, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, was prompted to advance on that rival to challenge entering upper
stretch, wrested a narrow advantage leaving the furlong marker and just lasted while drifting out under pressure in the closing stages. WELD shifted off the
inside early tracking off the second flight between rivals, split foes nearing the lane, then shifted four wide entering the stretch to steadily gain on the
leaders, moved to challenge the winner while drifting inwards under pressure nearing the wire and was just outfinished. INDY RIDE came through close
quarters in early stages to track the pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight, was prompted to advance in that path racing into upper stretch,
gained striking distance leaving the furlong marker and was taken up nearing the wire to avoid tight quarters while edging a rival for a share.
RATTLESNAKE RIDGE ducked inwards just after the start bumping SUCCESSFUL ROMAN, was quickly righted, then hustled to the lead from between
foes, angled sharply to the rail setting the pace into the turn, held sway to upper stretch but yielded once headed by the winner late. FOGGY FLIGHT
tracked the leaders along the rail racing to the turn, angled out five wide entering the stretch and continued evenly. SUCCESSFUL ROMAN, bumped then
steadied just after the start, was urged to contend between foes in the opening quarter, angled sharply to the inside nearing the turn but was spent early.
ANDREW THE BULL, held up avoiding some traffic just after the start, raced five wide behind the second flight racing to the turn and steadily faded.
COASTLINE SERMON was settled outside foes in the opening stages and dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF INDY RIDE
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER AND RUNNER UP WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY BUT NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
GREYZER, bobbled at the start while ducking inwards bumping MOONLIGHT GRAHAM, was collected off that rival to track the leaders along the rail
through the backstretch, shifted off the rail racing into the turn gathering momentum, angled four wide nearing upper stretch advancing to challenge, wrested
the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under pressure. HAIL SOUTHERN broke readily, angled inwards to press the pace three wide
through the backstretch into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, briefly resisted the winner's bid but proved no match late.
MOONLIGHT GRAHAM, bumped at the start losing some position to the leaders, was urged inside foes to gain terms with the first flight, disputed the pace
into the turn, dueled to upper stretch and gave way late. FRANKIE Z was urged between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn and
gave way entering the lane. BASTIEN LE BROWN was settled between foes, then dropped out last after the opening quarter, shifted out five wide racing
into the turn, gained some position in that path racing into upper stretch but made no real impression. UPRISE, off last, was prompted to make some brief
progress gaining position three wide between foes into the turn but came up empty nearing the lane. VET'S GIFT tracked off the first flight four wide in early
stages and steadily faded after a half. VANDRING tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening quarter but retreated early. MIKI DORA was
prompted to a contending position while angling sharply to the inside in the opening quarter but dropped out early.

Footnotes
MY COWBOY gained a forward placing attending a rival's pace racing to the first turn, pressed the issue on the backstretch to gain a clear advantage after
a half, held sway on the far turn, shifted to the three path nearing upper stretch while being prompted to resist a rival's challenge then disputed the issue in a
game effort to narrowly prevail under firm left handed pressure. PLATO was urged to a forward placing racing just off the leaders three deep to the
backstretch, moved to challenge nearing upper stretch while angling inside the eventual winner, bid for command nearest the rail in the stretch but was just
outkicked. SPIRIT MISSION tracked off the first flight a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing through the far turn and
continued in that path to gain a share while lacking the needed final bid. THANK YOU settled off the second flight along the inside racing to the first turn,
then gained position inside foes, then between rivals racing into upper stretch while never menacing the top pair. KITTEN STREET was urged to the lead
from the break while angling to the rail, dueled for command inside a rival to the backstretch, continued in pursuit along the inside on the far turn and gave
way into upper stretch. BOXER BOY tracked the leaders from out of striking distance racing four wide in second flight to the backstretch and continued
evenly between foes to late stages. IRISH MAJOR was settled last to the backstretch, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch but made no impact.
SECRET LIFE STYLE, held up avoiding close quarters just after the start, angled inside foes racing into the far turn but offered no rally. DAHOG tracked the
leaders three wide between foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded into the lane. ENTERTAINER angled to the inside
early tracking the leaders as part of the second flight but steadily retreated after a half.

Footnotes
HIFALUTIN broke readily, dictated the pace near the inside to the turn, held sway on a comfortable margin racing to upper stretch and maintained a safe
advantage to the end under pressure. MS. GENUINE tracked off the second flight near the inside early, shifted out splitting rivals leaving the midway point
of the turn and continued willingly to late stages to close the gap. SNIPER SIS, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the
turn, continued evenly in late stages. LUSCIOUS LINDA settled between foes dropping off the leaders, angled five wide in upper stretch and continued with
an effort to improve position. STAMINA PRINCESS tracked off the second flight outside foes, was caught five wide nearing upper stretch and offered no
rally. BIG BOSS LADY tracked off the second flight outside a rival through the backstretch, raced four wide through the turn and steadily faded into the lane.
PRINCES DYNAMITE, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter, angled to the inside entering the turn and gave way nearing upper
stretch. LADY AND ME proved no factor. J R SUPERSTAR showed little.

Footnotes
CLASSICAL MAGIC broke readily to join the pace outside foes racing through the chute, angled to the rail nearing the first turn to gain a clear advantage,
dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the second bend and continued grudgingly through the stretch to fend off rivals under firm right handed
pressure. MORGAN'S Z VA tracked just off the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing to the far turn, shifted three wide entering the lane and
continued willingly to close the gap while edging a rival for the place honors. CLASSY OF COURSE, forwardly placed along the rail leaving the chute,
steadied off the winner nearing the first turn while conceding the lead, switched outside that foe nearing the backstretch to prompt the pace, pressed the
issue on the far turn to upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. WANNA HAVE FUN settled off the third flight while angling to the inside racing to the
backstretch, gained some position inside foes racing to the far turn, swung out five wide entering the lane and was making steady progress late. BELLA
PIERINA tracked off the second flight early while angling to the inside, shifted out four wide in upper stretch but offered no rally. ELUSIVE RYDER settled
outside a rival in the last flight, angled in entering the far turn and continued with an effort to improve position. ANTALYA tracked off the second flight three
wide between foes racing into the backstretch and came up empty in the drive. FUN PADDY settled along the inside early but offered no rally. SHES
DYNOMITE, caught four wide tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, faded after a half. MIZZEN AIR angled to the inside while pulling a bit
against rating in the opening half, tracked just off the pacesetter along the rail racing into the far turn and emptied out racing through the lane.

Footnotes
BRANCO MARIA came through close quarters at the break, was prompted to a contending position while angling to the inside on the backstretch tracking
just off the first flight, shifted out three deep nearing the lane while being prompted to advance, then took over leaving midstretch to prove best under
pressure. PINSON tracked off the first flight racing four wide through the backstretch, continued in that path between foes racing into upper stretch and
prevailed narrowly for the place honors. BOW AND ARROW settled out of striking distance along the inside, shifted out racing into upper stretch and made
steady late progress three deep between foes to gain position to the end. UNCORK THE BOTTLE, forwardly placed three wide in early stages attending the
pace, shifted inwards racing into the turn to press the issue between foes into upper stretch but weakened late. FORWARD MOTION, urged inside foes
from the break to dictate the pace on a narrow margin to the turn, dueled for command inside foes to midstretch and gave out late. EXPENSIVE STYLE
tracked off the second flight outside foes racing through the backstretch, was fanned six wide into the lane but had no rally. SOARING BIRD tracked off the
second flight between foes racing to the turn, angled out to race five wide between rivals nearing the lane but quickly came up empty. FIRE MARSHALL
BILL settled between foes in the last flight early and offered no rally. ACTION WARRIOR urged between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch
into the turn, gave way after a half. LIBERTARIAN was settled outside foes early and never mounted a serious challenge.

Footnotes
ZANDREA'S, reluctant to load, then restless in the gate prior to the start, was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out
nearing upper stretch steadily pulling her way to contention, was fanned four wide entering the lane but produced a steady late response under left handed
pressure to prevail in time. SLEWYS CHOSEN ONE tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched out after a half, was
prompted to advance between foes into the second bend, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly between foes while just
outkicked by the winner. BROADWAY PEGGY, pulled her way to the lead along the rail in the opening stages to dictate the pace on a narrow margin,
dueled for command into the far turn to upper stretch, edged forward to a narrow advantage late but was collared by the top pair. PASSIONFORTREASURE
angled inwards to prompt the pacesetter between foes to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn to midstretch and gave out late. CAN'T KATZ
HER settled off the second flight while angling nearer the inside racing to the backstretch, then continued near the inside to make some mild progress into
the stretch. MOON EYES was rated between foes tracking off the first flight, then steadily faded into the lane. BIZ MAKER settled along the inside early but
failed to menace. LITTLE MS BROADWAY proved no factor. ONE SLICK FACT, forwardly placed three wide attending the pace racing to the backstretch,
lodged a brief bid on the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. WILD NORTH was held up along the inside racing to the first turn, switched outside foes
to race four wide on the backstretch and soon emptied out.
