STRAWBERRY WHISKY tracked the early pace, went six wide into the turn, took control at the eighth pole and edged clear. HENNESSY'S SQUIRT raced
in mid pack early, found room along the inside, took a brief lead, couldn't sustain, was no match late and finished second best. COMET CAUSEY was
unhurried early, advanced six wide, was gaining late and needed more ground. ELLIOT was allowed to settle early, saved ground and finished with a mild
late rally. MASTERCLASS was void of speed, circled seven wide and never fired. MR GOLD MAN set a pressured pace from off the rail and weakened.
FLYING PHANTOM was taken back early, advanced five wide and offered no rally. F S POSITRACK pressed the early pace from between rivals and faded.

Footnotes
DELIGHTFUL HIPS raced in mid pack early, circled eight wide into the turn, was closing late and was up in time. LAUGHAROO tracked the early pace,
raced seven wide and offered a mild late rally. STEVE'S BABE DOLL set a clear early pace, raced off the rail, opened up and weakened late. ROYAL
QUEEN was reserved early, advanced nine wide and finished belatedly. CONNIE'S LINDA was void of speed, raced far wide and never fired.
ESCAPABULL chased the early pace from between rivals and tired. DIXIE CHIP was taken back and was no threat. BETWEEN THE BUOYS was outrun
early from between rivals and was no factor. MCMISSY was allowed to settle early from the inside and faded.
