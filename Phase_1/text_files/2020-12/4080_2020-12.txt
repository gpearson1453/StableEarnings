Footnotes
SWING WEST tracked from midpack along the inside, slipped inside of foes turning for home to bid at the quarter pole, forged advantage from MEADE at
the three sixteenths marker, dueled inside of that foe through the lane, and tenaciously prevailed. MEADE prompted the pace five wide, then three wide into
the turn, took over from inner rivals at the five sixteenths pole, but met SWING WEST's rail bid at the quarter pole, was headed passing the three sixteenths
pole,battled on gamely, but failed to regain even terms. ICONIC lied far off of the pace two to three wide around the turn, spit foes four wide turning for
home, but was bumped by an outer rival when HARD WEST cut over in upper stretch, then recovered to stay on for a minor share. JANUARY WON lied far
off of the pace three to four wide around the turn before being put to tight quarters turning for home, swung out seven wide in upper stretch, and rallied.
DOCTOR D J saved ground far off of the pace, and rallied along the rail. HARD WEST rallied six wide turning for home, but shifted inwards in upper stretch,
bothered multiple foes, and leveled off. SMASH stalked two wide and between horses, but failed to produce a bid before weakening. THREE DEEP stalked
three to four wide, but weakened. FRANK FIRST chased the pace from the five path around the turn, but steadied when put to tight quarters in upper
stretch, and faded. ICE TEA vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but wilted through the field passing the five sixteenths pole. MONMOUTH DR
was off slowly and failed to factor. SO LONG CHUCK set a pressured pace along the inside, but was headed at the five sixteenths pole, and was eased
thereafter.

Footnotes
PRIME FACTOR pressed the pace two wide, cruised to the front in hand nearing the five-sixteenths pole, drew off under mild hand urging in upper stretch
and was wrapped up the last sixteenth of a mile. BRACKEN was off a bit slow, was shuffled back early, steadied into the turn, advanced two wide early on
the bend, was bumped near the five-sixteenths pole, split rivals four wide near the quarter pole and finished willingly to gain the place. DR. DUKE set the
pace inside of the winner, was no match for that foe nearing the lane and lost second late. BROADWAY saved ground off the pace early, angled out and
bumped BRACKEN nearing the five-sixteenths pole, came three wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally. SEMPER FIDELIS chased the pace inside
and came up empty in the lane. READTHETRANSCRIPT had some speed three wide and retreated after a half. SHOOTING was very reluctant to load,
raced four wide and was through early. COMPASS CAY was outrun outside. JULIUS THE GREAT was fractious in the gate, raced two wide and made little
impact.

Footnotes
CON LIMA led the short field through a moderate and lightly pressured pace, kicked clear in upper stretch when put to driving pressure, and was kept to
task to the wire. RUNAWAY ROCKETTE stalked the pace from the two path around the first turn, loomed just behind the leader around the far turn, but
failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and proved second best. TETE A TETE was off a step slow and taken in hand due to being a bit crowded between
horses at the start, trailed the field in the two path into the far turn, took that bend in the three path before shifting to the four path turning for home, and
stayed on to reach show. HAPPY CONSTITUTION stalked along the inside around the first turn before tipping outside of the pace setter into the
backstretch, applied mild pressure to that foe's flank down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with that foe turning for home, and faded through the
lane. MASHUGANA saved ground around both turns while far off of the pace, and failed to factor. GAMBLING CAT tracked from midpack along the inside,
but failed to produce a bid before weakening turning for home. FUNWHILEITLASTED lied off of the pace while shifting from the four path to the three path
around the first turn, inched closer in the two path around the far turn, shifted inwards turning for home, but shied inwards when the rider switched his whip
to his right hand approaching the furlong pole, bumped and fell into the inner railing, then walked off.

LETRUSKA set a rated pace inside, kicked clear in upper stretch, drifted out mildly and drew off under right-handed urging. DREAM MARIE tracked the
pace three wide, could not keep pace with the winner in the lane but finished willingly. BAJAN GIRL pressed the winner two wide, continued on her left lead
in the lane and lasted for the show. GOOD CREDENCE stalked the pace two wide between foes, was unable to quicken in upper stretch, brushed with
CRUMB BUN nearing the sixteenth pole, angled out soon after and weakened further. SALLY'S CURLIN failed to menace while racing four and five wide.
CRUMB BUN stalked the pace from the rail, weakened in the lane and brushed with GOOD CREDENCE near the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
WHAT A BEAUT stalked along the inside, smoothly tipped outside of the clear leader passing the three sixteenths pole, edged up to bid in midstretch,
battled as her inner counterpart dug in, and prevailed over that foe in the late stages. DADDY'S JOY set the pace along the inside, inched clear turning for
home in hand before being roused passing the three sixteenths pole with WHAT A BEAUT in pursuit, dug in inside of that foe in midstretch, dueled gamely,
but was bested. FIERCE SCARLETT was slow into stride, saved ground far off of the pace along the inside, shifted from the three path to the five path while
rallying through traffic turning for home, then sustained a grinding charge, but failed to have enough to catch the leaders. OUR LITTLE JEWEL steadied
along inside through much of the second quarter-mile, remained bottled up behind horses around the far turn, cut the corner after being out-moved by outer
foes turning for home, and stayed on evenly through the lane to reach a minor share. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN steadied along in traffic between horses on the
first turn, rallied four wide around the far turn to striking position turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch. PASSION PLUS lied far off of the pace
two wide, took the far turn in the four to six path as FIERCE SCARLETT floated her out, then failed to produce a bid while hanging on her left lead through
the lane. YOLANDA'S PRIDE lied forwardly placed two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but was outmoved by outer foes turning for
home, and failed to factor. NAPA RULES pressed the pace two wide, vied into the backstretch, began to falter around the far turn before being outmoved by
outer foes turning for home, and was eased through the lane. GHOSTLY BEAUTY gained three wide around the first turn to a stalking position into the
backstretch, but weakened between horses around the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
LADY'S ISLAND sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace a bit off the rail, held clear past the sixteenth pole, drifted out a bit late and just lasted under
right-handed urging. BRONX BEAUTY ranged in range three wide, came four wide into the lane, closed widest and just missed. CINNABUNNY settled off
the pace along the inside, angled out in midstretch, closed between rivals under left-handed urging, came out and bumped SOUND MACHINE twice late,
switched leads and was outkicked. SOUND MACHINE chased the winner from the rail, angled two wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole, rallied between
rivals in the lane, was bumped twice by CINNABUNNY in deep stretch and checked approaching the wire. AUNT NADINE never threatened while racing
three and four wide. GOLDEN AMI had early speed two wide, was put in tight by SOUND MACHINE nearing the five-sixteenths pole, dropped back and
lacked a further response. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF CINNABUNNY AGAINST THE WINNER
FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH BUT THE STEWARDS FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
DONEGAL BAY set the pace along the inside, shook clear from pressing foes when let out a notch at the quarter pole, drew off and shifted ground outwards
in upper stretch, widened under driving pressure at the furlong pole, and continued to edge away while being kept to task. SIMOVITCH prompted the
eventual winner two wide and from between horses, but failed to keep pace with that foe turning for home, battled for place outside of a pair of foes through
upper stretch, and held that position to the wire. AMERICAN LAW trailed early on, advanced along the inside into the turn, tipped two wide around the bend,
split foes passing the three sixteenths pole as the leader kicked away, dueled between horses for place through midstretch, but failed to catch his outer
counterpart. MIDLANER lied forwardly placed, tracked while saving ground, failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, but sustained a duel for
place inside of a pair of foes through midstretch before yielding late. SIGRUN FAST BOY pressed the pace three wide, but weakened turning for home, and
hung on his left lead through the lane. ALEXANDER VALLEY lied off of the pace two wide, got outmoved and faltered to trail the field at the half mile pole,
then took the turn in the five to four path, and failed to factor. FLAMINGO HAWK chased from midpack four wide around the turn, and weakened.
TOSCANITO lied off of the pace five wide, took the turn in the four to five path, and failed to factor. WILL TAKE CONTROL was off slow and broke a bit
inwards, lied off of the pace along the inside, took the turn two to three wide, and was done early.

TAX set the pace in hand while inside of a pair of pressing foes, shook free from those rivals with five sixteenths to run, widened handily turning for home,
and stayed strong under a statuesque rider through the lane. EYE OF A JEDI lied far off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the two to three
path while rallying inside of MATH WIZARD, held that path turning for home and split foes three wide in upper stretch, then reached place in the late stages.
PHAT MAN stalked the trio of leaders from the inside around the first turn, then from the four path around the far turn, forged place turning for home as TAX
glided away, but was outfinished by an inner rallying rival for that position in the late stages. MATH WIZARD lied far off of the pace two wide, gained in the
five path around the far turn along with EYE OF A JEDI, attempted a place bid in upper stretch, but leveled off and failed to make late headway.
IDENTIFIER lied off of the pace three wide, then from the four to six path around the far turn, and failed to factor. TATWEEJ prompted the pace three wide,
but failed to keep pace with his innermost counterpart with five sixteenths to run, and faltered. ROYAL URN pressed the eventual winner two wide and from

LARGENT settled off the pace while racing two wide around the first turn, saved ground rounding most of the far turn, swung out approaching the stretch,
made a quick bid outside to seized command in midstretch and drove clear. DOSWELL was bumped at the start, saved ground in midpack, steadied off
heels near the quarter pole, got through inside in upper stretch and rallied for the place. BREAKING THE RULES bumped with DOSWELL at the start,
saved ground off the pace, advanced four wide around the far turn, bid inside of the winner in upper stretch but was outkicked. SPOOKY CHANNEL raced
well back two and three wide and improved position in the lane. CHANNEL CAT saved ground well back, angled out in upper stretch, made good progress
between rivals in upper stretch and flattened out a bit late. TIDE OF THE SEA was very rank at the start, checked not long after, raced well back two and
three wide and never threatened. HALLADAY set the pace along the rail for a mile and weakened. FACTOR THIS prompted the pace two wide and tired in
the drive. SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN tracked the pace in the clear and had no response. DELAWARE (GB) failed to menace while racing two and three
wide.

Footnotes
MIRA MISSION was off a step slowly, tucked down from the four to the two path around the first turn, held that path into the far turn before shifting back four
wide at the five sixteenths pole, rallied to bid for the lead turning for home, swept past the leader straightening into the lane, and drew off thereafter. WORLD
CRUISER took a bump from an inner foe at the start, tucked to the rail while trailing into the first turn, advanced while saving ground around the far turn
before tipping three wide turning for home, bumped with MILLEAN in midstretch while rallying on his left lead, then prevailed over that foe for place.
MILLEAN stalked along the inside, saved ground before shifting two wide turning for home, chased then drawing of leader through upper stretch as WORLD
CRUISER ranged up along side, exchanged a bump with that foe at the furlong grounds, and was outfinished by him for place. THE BEST DISTANCE set
the pace along the inside, but was headed turning for home, and tired. DEMON tracked from midpack in the two path around the first turn, shifted three to
four wide turning for home while attempting a rally, but only produced a mild grind. LEASE saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, shifted to the
four path into the far turn, gained mildly outside of DEMON turning for home, but failed to sustain a bid. DAISY'S DOC was unhurried at the rear of the field
two wide, took the far turn in the four path, but failed to keep pace with an inner foe approaching the quarter pole, which allowed him to shift inwards turning
for home, then stayed on through the lane, but failed to menace. GANDOLFO lied far off of the pace early on, took the far turn in the three to four path while
amongst traffic, and failed to factor. EXPONENTIAL settled off of the pace two wide, got caught in the five path around the far turn, and failed to make an
impact. DASSULT MIRAGE broke outwards and bumped a foe at the start, recovered to be forwardly placed in the three to two path around the first turn,
took the far turn three wide while trying to mount a challenge, but weakened turning for home. FIGO stalked two wide, but wilted through the field turning for
home.
