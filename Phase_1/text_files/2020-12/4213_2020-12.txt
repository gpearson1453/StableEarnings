Footnotes
AIN'T WASTING TIME broke readily, prompted a rival's pace through the backstretch into the turn, shook clear racing into the lane and widened in a ridden
out effort. CHINOMADITO broke outwards bumping SILENT MISCHIEF, was settled off the second flight, was held up off rivals when boxed in traffic leaving
the midway point of the turn, split foes four wide in upper stretch and proved best of the others while failing to menace the winner. HE HAD A SECRET,
urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, dueled for command inside the eventual winner racing into the turn and gave way. BIG CITY
RALPH angled inwards tracking off the first flight racing to the turn and came up empty in the drive. SILENT MISCHIEF, bumped at the start, recovered
quickly to track off the first flight four wide racing into the turn but faded nearing upper stretch. OLLYSILVEREXPRESS settled last while angling inside and
failed to menace thereafter. RICKY RUN, pulling hard between foes in the opening, raced three deep between foes into the turn and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
ASTRONAUT OSCAR broke sharply, shifted off the inside setting the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, conceded the lead entering the turn
to attend KALU'S pace through the bend, was prompted to challenge that foe racing into upper stretch and edged that foe in a prolonged drive under brisk
handling. KALU, forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, advanced inside the pacesetter to press the issue racing into the turn, maintained a
narrow advantage to upper stretch and gamely contested the issue to the end in a protracted skirmish to just miss. NATIVE HAWK tracked the leaders
between foes in second flight racing to the turn and continued evenly in late stages to prevail for a share. PERFETTO, forwardly placed three deep between
foes tracking just off the leaders racing into the turn, faded into upper stretch. MR LIGHTNING BOY settled last early and passed only tiring rivals. DON'S
MARSH, caught four wide tracking the leaders in second flight racing to the turn, steadily faded nearing the lane. NOTACATBUTACARD tracked the leaders
along the inside as part of the second flight and steadily faded in late stages.

Footnotes
DRILL'S VALENTINE, in touch with the pacesetter between foes attending the pace racing through the backstretch, pressed the pacesetter racing through
the turn to upper stretch, shook away leaving the furlong marker to open a clear advantage between calls and maintained a safe margin under firm right
handed pressure. SUGAR BRITCHES tracked off the second flight along the inside racing through the backstretch, shifted out entering the lane to advance
in the four path, came through close quarters splitting rivals midstretch and proved best of the others while moving to close the gap. INDY PRINCESS
KOKO tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted out gathering momentum nearing upper stretch while being fanned to the six
path, was bumped by CAPTUREMENOW leaving the furlong marker, then exchanged repeated contact with that foe but continued with interest to prevail for
a share. CAPTUREMENOW tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening quarter, shifted out to the five path racing into upper stretch, drifted out
making contact with INDY PRINCESS KOKO leaving midstretch, then exchanged repeated contact in the closing stages while being outkicked for a share.
TETON THAI broke sharply, set the pace on a narrow margin while angling to the rail, dueled for command into upper stretch but came up empty leaving
the furlong marker. I AM A. LURING, in touch with the first flight three wide prompting the pace to the turn, gave way nearing upper stretch.
BOOTSCOOTINSHUFFLE angled to the inside early tracking off the first flight and steadily faded nearing the lane. TURBOTIGER stumbled badly at the
start and trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN LATE STRETCH BUT
TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
UNION APPRECIATION was settled off the second flight in the opening stages, angled to the rail racing past the half mile marker, saved ground on the turn,
briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then drove through inside the leaders leaving the furlong marker to gain the advantage under firm right
handed pressure. STRUM AND PLUCK, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace in the opening quarter, pressed the issue nearing upper stretch to gain the
advantage late but was outkicked by the winner. HE'S ROYALTY, urged along the inside setting the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the bend,
dueled for command into the lane and weakened between the top pair late. ROGUE RAGE, three deep between foes in second flight in the opening stages,
was held up dropping back off those rivals in the second furlong, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. TINKER'S
PAL tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. TARQUIN broke outwards bumping SYNDAR'S ANGEL at the
start, was righted quickly to track just off the leaders as part of the second flight while angling to the inside, saved ground on the turn, shifted off the rail
nearing upper stretch and quickly came up empty. ROCK N RALLY, caught four wide in the opening quarter tracking the leaders as part of the second flight,
gave way racing into the turn. SYNDAR'S ANGEL, bumped soundly at the start, trailed throughout.

DIXIELAND DARLING, bumped at the start, dropped out last leaving the chute, pulled her way against firm restraint into the backstretch, split foes gaining
some position racing into the far turn, was prompted to advance between rivals nearing upper stretch, swung out four wide entering the lane, was carried out
slightly midstretch but wrested the advantage and went clear under some right handed encouragement. SPIN CLASS, reserved outside a rival tracking just
off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while caught four wide racing into the far turn, circled rivals in that path racing into
upper stretch to gain the advantage, shifted out into the winner's path nearing midstretch but soon proved no match. LADY DOMINANCE angled to the rail
in early stages, was reserved off the second flight along the inside racing to the far turn, swung out five wide entering the lane and made some belated
progress. BEACH CHICK broke out bumping the eventual winner, angled to the inside leaving the chute tracking just off the pacesetter, came around that
foe racing into upper stretch but had no closing response. STORMY WAGER, forwardly placed three deep stalking the pacesetter to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance in tandem with several rivals racing into the far turn but quickly gave way nearing upper stretch. SOCIAL DISCUSSION, forwardly
placed along the rail in the opening stages, shifted out on the first turn to race between foes attending a rival's pace, pressed the issue on the far turn into
the lane but emptied out leaving the furlong marker. VAN KHOZAN sped to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a
narrow margin to the far turn and gave way racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
SACRAMENTO Q took up a position tracking off the first flight while angling to the rail leaving the half mile marker, steadily advanced inside foes on the
turn, came through to challenge for command when presented an opening inside the pacesetter in upper stretch, disputed the issue in a protracted skirmish
to late stages but edged ahead under firm left handed pressure. RIDE INTO THE SKY sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow
margin racing into the turn, shifted off the inside entering the lane, then grudgingly resisted the winner's challenge through the final three sixteenths in a
game effort to just miss. ELLAS MY LOVE tracked off the first flight four wide racing through the backstretch, was urged to advance on the leader in that
path entering the turn to gain striking distance after a half but lacked the needed closing bid. MULLED WINE settled off the second flight while shifting
inwards in the opening quarter, angled to the rail entering the turn and continued evenly inside foes to late stages. THE GREAT LOUDINI, slow to gather
stride, dropped out last on the backstretch but continued with interest to gain some position three deep between foes entering the lane. EXECUTIVE
DECREE, forwardly placed three deep racing just off the leaders, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter in that path racing into the turn and gave way. TALE
OF A SONG ducked at the start, was righted to track off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, but offered no rally. R HOT TWENTY'S was off
slowly and failed to menace thereafter. BACK PAGE, in touch prompting the pacesetter in the opening quarter, gave way after three furlongs.

Footnotes
BACANO shifted inwards racing through the chute while being rated off the leaders, continued under light reserve tracking off the second flight to the
backstretch, commenced a steady advance outside rivals when prompted nearing the far turn, took over racing into upper stretch and made the balance of
the pace under firm handling. KODIAK BROWN was rated out of striking distance along the inside in the opening half, shifted out to split foes advancing to
contention entering the far turn, shifted three wide racing into upper stretch while being roused to close the gap on the winner but proved only second best.
VINTNER, held up off the first flight inside foes racing to the first turn, shifted off the inside racing into the backstretch, angled out four wide nearing the lane
and continued with an effort to improve position. MAYRHOFEN, off a step slowly, was settled last along the inside in the opening half, shifted out splitting
foes leaving the far turn and continued with an effort to improve position. TEXAS GIANT settled well off the leaders near the inside racing to the backstretch
and passed only tiring rivals. BOURBON TAN raced five wide through the chute prompting the pace outside foes, shifted inwards racing into the first turn,
sped clear into the backstretch, held sway to the fa turn but gave out once headed by the winner entering upper stretch. MY BROTHERSLEDGE, forwardly
placed between foes racing to the first turn, tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight for a half and steadily faded. IGOTSUNSHINE,
urged to forward placing inside foes leaving the chute, tracked the leaders along the inside in second flight racing to the backstretch and emptied out
abruptly after a half. CHAOS KID, urged to prompt the pace four wide between foes through the chute, angled to the inside racing into the first turn while
continuing in pursuit of the pacesetter but gave way early.

Footnotes
LORD BARNA, urged to a forward placing while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, tracked the pacesetter from just out of striking distance through
the backstretch, readily advanced on that foe while shifting out to bid for command nearing upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage from that foe racing
through the stretch and grudgingly held ATONE to the end under firm handling. The latter angled inwards a bit racing to the first turn to track the leaders
between foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance nearing upper stretch while shifing out three wide, moved to
challenge in that path leaving midstretch and gained even terms on the wire under pressure to share the win. MO HAWK broke readily, dictated the pace on
a comfortable margin while in hand racing into the backstretch, held sway into the far turn, briefly resisted when challenged racing past midstretch but
yielded to the top pair late. BIRD'S EYE VIEW was rated off the second flight along the inside, conceded some position after a half, gained position inside
foes on the far turn, swung out four wide racing into the lane and continued with a mild bid. THE SINNER IS YOU, reserved off the second flight outside foes
racing to the backstretch, continued evenly between foes into the stretch. FLY THE W worked his way to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the
second flight in the opening half, saved ground to the lane but had no closing bid. J BERESFORD TIPTON, reserved outside foes in the last flight to the
backstretch, raced four wide between foes on the far turn into upper stretch but offered no rally. DAZZLING TRUTHS, held up in close quarters near the
inside early, settled in the last flight, switched out after a half, was caught five wide racing through the far turn but had no rally. ARCADIA CALLS, urged to a
forward placing tracking the leaders from out of striking distance, steadily faded after a half.

Footnotes
LAKOTA PRINCESS broke readily to gain a forward placing between foes, was held up avoiding tight quarters after the opening three sixteenth to track off
the first flight outside foes, was urged four wide on the turn to bid for command nearing upper stretch, shifted in sharply once gaining the advantage to
dispute the issue outside MERMAID KISSES racing through the stretch and edged that foe in time under firm handling. The latter angled inwards while
being urged pursuing the leaders into the turn, split foes just off the inside when presented an opening racing into upper stretch to challenge for command
along the inside and contested the issue grudgingly to the end. FOGGY FLIGHT settled off the second flight in early stages, advanced five, then six wide
racing into the lane but continued to improve position. FOOT RUB LOVE tracked off the second flight between foes to the turn and improved position four
wide between foes late. THE OTHER CAT angled in sharply to gain terms with the pacesetter prompting that foe three wide into the bend, drifted while
racing in close quarters nearing the lane and gave way entering the stretch. PLAY THE MAX broke sharply, vied for command between foes into the turn,
then upper stretch but gave way late. RISEN CHANGE bobbled at the start while breaking slowly and never gained contention. MARDI GRAS GIRL tracked
off the second flight four wide between foes racing to the turn and faded early. GIPSEY SORCERESS worked her way to the inside tracking off the second
flight and steadily faded. TREASURED INFO, urged inside foes disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way after a half.
BROWNSTONEPRINCESS proved no factor.
