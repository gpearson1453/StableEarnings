COIN THE PHRASE tracked the runaway pacesetter from the rail in the clear, tipped out in upper stretch, advanced two wide, seized command near the
sixteenth pole and powered clear while ridden out. MIAHSOLOMIAH sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail, led to the sixteenth pole
and held for the place. ALLURING RUMBA raced off the pace two wide to upper stretch and had a mild rally outside. MYSTIC MOON broke awkwardly,
raced well back three wide and rallied belatedly. ST. LOUIE ARCH lacked speed, saved ground throughout and never threatened. WATER WIZARD saved
ground to no avail. FLAT OUT COOL was outrun while racing two wide. MIRANDA SOFIA played no factor while racing four wide. BETTIN ONNA KITTEN
made little impact while racing two and three wide.

PLEASE SIT DOWN settled off the pace outside, made strong progress three wide around the turn, seized command approaching the eighth pole and drew
off under a drive. MIGHTY FAST vied two wide through the opening quarter, settled back into a stalking position midway down the backstretch, re-bid two
wide nearing the quarter pole, drew clear leaving that marker, led to midstretch but was no match for the winner from there. EXCALIBUR chased the pace
outside, lacked a rally and bested the rest. MONEY HOUSE failed to menace while racing two wide. ARMANDO'S TEAM broke outwardly and slowly,
lagged inside, angled five wide turning for home and never threatened. MALETTA set the pace along the rail and retreated through the lane. SLIPPY had
brief speed two wide and was easing through the lane. TRIBUTE FLAG was pulled up nearing the half-mile pole and vanned off. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
GRAN SAMAN stalked the three-ply duel inside, lacked room in upper stretch, got clear three wide nearing the eighth pole and drove clear.
DISCRETIONARY MARQ dueled two wide between rivals and stayed on gamely to best the pace rivals while unable to hold off the winner. EARTH set the
pace along the rail, dueled inside of two rivals around the turn and through much of the lane and was outfinished. ROYAL ASSET saved ground off the pace
early, angled four wide nearing the lane, made some progress outside, switched back to the left lead late and flattened out. TENACITY ZIP pressed the
pace three wide and weakened through the lane. OHANZEE raced off the pace two wide, angled five wide nearing the lane and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
OMNIA set the pace along the rail, drew off around the turn and widened while in hand through the lane. CALLMESENORITA lacked early speed, moved up
three wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and moved into a clear second. NATIONALIST chased the winner two wide and lacked a
closing bid. MARIALUISA was soundly bumped multiple times at the start, raced off the pace two wide and passed tiring rivals. MAGICGIRL had some early
speed inside, bumped near the nine-sixteenths marker and steadily faded inside. BEASAICHI chased the pace three wide and faded through the lane.
AMBER PRINCESS had early speed outside, bumped near the nine-sixteenth pole and retreated. SIMPLE STORY broke outwardly and repeatedly bumped
MARIALUISA at the start, had the rider lose the irons in the scrum, never recovered the irons, was pulled up and walked off. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND RULED THAT SIMPLE STORY CAUSED HER OWN TROUBLE.

Footnotes
BREAK BEAT prompted the pace two wide, was shuffled back a bit nearing the quarter pole, shifted four wide in upper stretch, rallied gamely between rivals
and was up in the final strides. ROCHAMBEAU stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide in upper stretch, rallied between foes and just missed. THE
ANGRY MAN settled off the early pace two wide, raced three wide around the far turn, came five wide into the lane and rallied widest. EAGERLY stalked
the pace three wide, took the lead three deep nearing the quarter pole, angled into the two path soon after, led through much of the lane and was swallowed
up late. LIGHT CRUISER set the pace along the rail, was collared near the quarter pole, vied to deep stretch and was outfinished. JOE BENJAMIN raced off
the pace inside and lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
PINE LEAF was prominent from the outset three wide, got closest to SECRET MISTRESS around the turn, finished determinedly and was up outside that
rival in the closing yards. SECRET MISTRESS sprinted clear early, showed the way inside to deep stretch, but could not withstand the top one near the
finish. PIPER vied briefly inside SECRET MISTRESS before being outsprinted, saved ground to the stretch and ran on to best the remainder. DANCE FOR
THE SUN bumped with BRODY'S HONOR at the start, raced well back to the head of the stretch, and improved position without threatening. PITUFINA
raced three wide, and lacked a solid response. BRODY'S HONOR bumped with DANCE FOR THE SUN at the start, shifted out five wide past the
quarter-pole, and made no impact. TRASHTHETRAILER was no factor three to four wide. CAT DIVA became unsettled in the gate prior to the start, came
away in good order and chased between horses to the turn, and tired after three-eighths of a mile. BAILA MORENA hit the right side of the gate at the start,
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TOWA broke outward but was away alertly, eased back letting DIENDA and MY MASTERPIECE go on the first turn, saved ground just off those two to the
far turn, shifted out two wide and wrested command outside DIENDA at the top of the stretch, dug in as LITTLE BIT GOOD challenged through the furlong
grounds, and gamely prevailed in a head bob. LITTLE BIT GOOD went along in the middle of the pack to the far turn, maneuvered out three wide with aim
at the leaders past the quarter-pole, bid outside TOWA through the lane and just missed. STEFANIE ON FLEEK was shut off behind TOWA at the start,
saved ground in the second flight for six furlongs, came two wide into the stretch, and rallied to go clear of the remainder. LOVELY BROWN raced in the
second flight to the stretch, and posed no serious threat with an even finish. JUST A BIT SASSY improved position three wide after six furlongs, but could
not sustain the bid. HELENA BEAT bumped with MY MASTERPIECE at the start, took closer order three wide approaching the stretch, but flattened out.
DIENDA took over on the first turn, showed the way inside for six furlongs, and gave way. OUR FANTASY broke outward, raced three wide and was never
in it. MY MASTERPIECE bumped with HELENA BEAT at the start, prompted the pace outside DIENDA for six furlongs, and faltered.

speed between horses into the turn, and weakened approaching the quarter-pole. TRAPPEZOID was bumped between horses at the start, raced two to
three wide, and tired after a half. MIDNIGHT WHISKEY bumped with TRAPPEZOID at the start, and was finished early inside. This race was hand timed.

TRACY ANN'S LEGACY took command soon after the start and moved inside, shook off LADY BOSS into the stretch and was driving to remain well clear.
CATCH A THRILL raced two to three wide around the turn, and rallied outside to get up for the place. SANITY bumped with LADY BOSS at the start, saved
ground throughout, and was up for the show. LADY BOSS bumped with SANITY at the start, took a run at TRACY ANN'S LEGACY from outside around the
turn, but weakened through the drive. OVER GATORS saved ground around the turn, and lacked a solid closing bid. DEFY EXPECTATIONS was forwardly
placed inside early, and faded in the stretch. NIKEE KAN was no factor two wide. MAJIC FLASH trailed two wide.

Footnotes
KING OF ROCK chased outside FRENCH REEF from the outset, exchanged bumps with that rival through the drive, and took a hard-fought decision.
FRENCH REEF (IRE) crossed over inside with a clear early lead, responded when hooked by KING OF ROCK, exchanged bumps through the lane and just
missed. SURPRISE FACTOR broke outward brushing into SOPE for several strides and contributing to crowding, moved off the inside approaching the
stretch, and finished willingly outside. MISTER KELLY moved out three wide leaving the turn, and gained mildly for the last major share. VALID EXCHANGE
chased two wide to the stretch, and could not gain through the late stages. WHERE YA GOIN OWEN moved in while racing in the second flight, and never
factored. SOPE was leaned on by SURPRISE FACTOR and crowded and steadied between horses at the start, and saved ground to no avail. MUKULWITZ
came in at the start leaning on COLD WARRIOR for several strides and contributing to crowding, and was outrun two to three wide. MR. WHO was slow into
stride after bumping with XMASINTHECITY at the break, got out steadily around the turn, and never got close. XMASINTHECITY bumped with MR. WHO at
the start, raced three wide and tired after three furlongs. SOUL REFLECTION was crowded and steadied between horses at the start, and was always far
back. COLD WARRIOR was crowded and steadied between horses at the start, and trailed inside.
