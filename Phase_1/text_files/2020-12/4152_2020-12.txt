Footnotes
MR. VECCHIO rated the pace well off the rail, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, then dug in
under an all out drive to hold on. INDUS VALLEY MAN chased the pace and rounded the turn about the three path, then dug in leaving the eighth pole to
take second the final strides. READY TO RUN was a bit reluctant to load and engaged in close chase through the backstretch, contested at a slim
disadvantage two deep on the turn but drifted into the stretch and was nipped from second under the wire. ORACLE OF OMAHA chased the pace about the
three path, drifted to the five path approaching the top of the stretch and had a strong finish outside. FROSTY'S MAJESTY chased the pace inside, raced at
the rail on the turn and raced evenly to late stretch, but lugged in and was steadied approaching the wire. WINDSOR CALLING gave chase through the
backstretch, rounded the turn at the rail but showed little more. MANNA FROM HANNAH chased the pace, raced at the rail on the turn and proved empty in
the lane. TRUTH SERUM came out of the gate rank which resulted in the rider losing his left iron, then raced well back leaving the chute.

Footnotes
ADIOS SEE YA chased the pace through the backstretch and raced at the rail on the turn, took the lead in the upper stretch and was steadily handled to
hold on well. JUST GO WITH IT set a pressured pace from the three eighths pole and drew clear at the rail midway on the turn, but, gave up the lead in the
upper stretch; while finishing evenly. THE FRANCHISE chased the pace inside, raced at the rail on the turn, angled to the three path toward the head of the
lane and finished evenly. TRINNI ENERGY chased the pace outside, raced in the five path of the turn then flattened stride later yards. THE BOOK OF ROD
was a bit sluggish getting into stride then saved ground. WHAT ABOUT SHORTY was not a factor. HER ZEALOUS was hustled along with the lead the
opening three sixteenths of a mile, gave chase from the three eighths pole and raced in the four path of the turn, but weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
PYRRHIC VICTORY rated a short lead inside, came under pressure past the quarter pole and raced at the rail through the far turn, then widened under
vigorous stretch urging. MORALITY CLAUSE was bumped outward and into Mnemosyne then checked off the heels of Charitable Any into the first turn,
settled off the pace leaving the turn though bid leaving the three eighths pole, took over second two deep midway on the far turn but was no match in the
stretch. CALLINGHERCOLLINS broke outward and rounded the opening turn about the five path, raced close into the backstretch and picked up the chase
leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail but flattened stride inside the eighth pole. CASTLE REVIEW rated close to the early pace
inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn just off the rail, then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. ANSHI saved ground
off the pace, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and showed little more. MNEMOSYNE broke inward to
make contact with Morality Clause, picked up the chase from the half mile pole but showed little response. HER JUSTICE raced well back. CHARITABLE
ANY was reluctant to load, entered the first turn about the four path but angled in across the path of Morality Clause and stalked through the turn, then faded
past the three eighths pole. GOT ANY raced in the six and seven paths the first turn and was through early.

Footnotes
LETTS GO TO DIXIES tapered to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, kept the advantage nearest the rail on the
far turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold off SHERWOOD LADY, who stalked the winner off the rail and picked up the chase toward the
three eighths pole, raced close off the rail through the far turn, then couldn't gain in the stretch. SKYLAR'S TRICK saved ground off the pace the first turn
and rated close into the backstretch, started a bid at the rail midway on the far turn, but dropped back into the lane and flattened stride the final sixteenth.
IMAGOODCHATTERBUG settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced in
the six path of the far turn and passed a rival down the lane. MABEL rounded the opening turn in the four and five paths, started a bid leaving the three
eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and showed little more. SCOTTISH DENIS broke a step slow and raced in the three and four paths the
first turn, left the turn outside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but showed little response. BUFF N stalked the early pace from the three
path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened approaching the far turn.

Footnotes
P J'S EGO chased the pace off the rail and raced close two deep on the turn, dug in under determined handling to take the nod later yards and was inching
further ahead nearing the wire. BEST TO BE ME tapered in to rate the pace and contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, dug in gamely to the
winners' challenge leaving the eighth pole but reluctantly yielded to that one later yards. AT THE HALF was bumped at the break then picked up the chase
through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and finished well. HOUSE OF LOVE gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the four path of the
turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. CANDYFORACAUSE gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the six path, then passed a rival
down the lane. SPRING LASS chased the pace inside, raced at the rail on the turn and finished evenly. SUDDEN BRILLIANCE came in at the break to
make contact with Doves Out, picked up the chase inside, rounded the turn in the two and three paths and showed little further. WHOA BLACK BETTY
saved ground on the turn. DOVES OUT was bumped inward and into At The Half leaving the gate, gave only distant chase then drifted wide on the turn.

Footnotes
SOUND OFF raced well back inside the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and improved steadily in
the six path of the far turn, raced outside entering the stretch and dug in to take the nod through the final yards. SHAMROCK KID stalked the pace about the
three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn, drifted into the stretch, dug in for a slim lead
mid-stretch but was caught in the final strides. HOBE SOUND stalked the early pace from the three and four paths, gave chase leaving the three eighths
pole and raced in the four path of the far turn then dug in to take third the final strides. LION LORD stalked the pace two deep, picked up the chase nearing
the five sixteenths pole and raced at even terms while two deep and between horses through the far turn, was caught inside the sixteenth pole and flattened
stride later yards. KING MAURO raced well back about the four path the first turn and left the turn outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn in the six path and finished well. SINGANOTHERSONG rated the pace inside, came under pressure past the three eighths pole and was met at
even terms nearest the rail midway on the far turn, contested the edge through the upper stretch, but weakened inside the sixteenth pole. GIO DUDE saved
ground and bid only mildly leaving the seven sixteenths pole. THE WAYNE FACTOR was not a factor. SCHLOSSER checked from tight quarters early and
raced in the five path the first turn, then showed little response after the opening half mile.

Footnotes
CREEKMORE stalked the pace in the three path, rallied to the lead three wide approaching the quarter pole, drew away from the middle of the far turn and
held well under steady handling. WIDGET FACTORY raced with the early pace inside and took over nearing the three eighths pole, turned back Alphastest
from that point but was caught at the rail nearing the quarter pole and had to settle for second best. COOL MAN CLETUS stalked the pace toward the
inside, picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail, lost some ground leaving the turn but finished evenly. BIZ
NASTY saved ground well off the pace the first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch and improved in the five path of the far turn, but flattened
stride inside the sixteenth pole. COMPOUND INTEREST raced in the five path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path but flattened inside the eighth pole. JUST CHILL OUT rounded the opening turn in the two and
three paths and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the four path and
showed little in the lane. BLIMEY LIMEY rated off the early pace while saving ground, bid mildly from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the
rail then weakened. BEAU TRACE raced in the four path the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. AY CARUMBA raced well
back. ALPHASTEST was hustled along with the pace two deep and gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, but dropped back from the five sixteenths
and weakened. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Creekmore, lodged by the rider of Widget Factory, though found no infraction.
