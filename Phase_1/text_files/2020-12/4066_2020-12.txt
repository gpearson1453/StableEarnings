Footnotes
MONTE NE bumped with FUTURE PRINCE at the start, vied early between REACTION TIME and CHAMBERLAIN, took over turning for home, and
responded to keep GRAND UNION at bay late. GRAND UNION eyed the leaders from easy striking range for three furlongs, came three wide into the lane
to loom a threat outside MONTE NE, but could not reach that one while clearly second best. WHO IS JARETT raced three to four wide around the turn,
finished evenly outside and was up for the show. VICMAR was reserved near the inside to the quarter-pole, gained mildly through upper stretch but needed
more and lost third near the finish. REACTION TIME bumped with MATCH RUNNER after the start, set a pressured pace inside rivals for three furlongs,
and gave way. GLACIER PARK bumped lightly with FUTURE PRINCE at the start, and was outrun inside. FUTURE PRINCE got bumped between horses
at the start, and was never close. MATCH RUNNER broke out bumping REACTION TIME just after the start, moved out three wide and was outrun.
CHAMBERLAIN showed early speed three wide, and was through on the turn.

Footnotes
RESERVENOTATTAINED dueled inside of SHOSHONE BRAVE in the two path for a half, drifted out in upper stretch, straightened out under right-handed
urging soon after and drew off. WICKSTERS DREAM prompted the pace four wide to upper stretch and was no match for the winner in the lane while
holding clear for the place. BOLD ENVOY saved ground in range, lacked a rally and bested the rest. GEMO had some speed between foes, lightly steadied
near the five-eighths pole, dropped back two wide around the turn and lacked a rally. SHOSHONE BRAVE dueled outside of the winner in the three path
and tired in the lane. OUTSHINE trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
MAKISUPA (GB) went along perched outside CAT LADY for six furlongs, had an initial bid repelled coming off the far turn, stayed on task and gained the
upper hand through the last sixteenth of a mile. CAT LADY took command after the start, rated along through an even pace inside, dug in when challenged
after six furlongs, and yielded grudgingly late. A LOOKER bumped with ZOOLOGY at the start, saved ground throughout, and was going well at the finish.
ZOOLOGY bumped with A LOOKER at the start, was keyed up resisting restraint through much of the first quarter-mile, shifted out three wide roused
leaving the far turn, but came up empty. FEARLESS GIRL broke a step slowly, went into the first turn three wide, and never factored. COPPER became
fractious unseating the rider behind the gate, came away in good order, stayed in range three wide to the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
ROMANTICAL NOTE saved ground off the pace, was shuffled back at the rail from the five-sixteenths marker to the quarter pole, angled three wide nearing
the lane, split rivals in upper stretch, closed and was up and clear late. SKYFLY was urged along four wide, dropped back a bit while still four deep around
the turn but stayed on to gain the place late. UNCAPTURED HEART dueled at the rail for three furlongs, kicked clear nearing the lane, widened in upper
stretch and weakened late. JADE EMPRESS vied two wide between rivals down the backstretch, could not match strides around the turn, chased inside
around that bend and lacked a closing bid. THINK IT THRU disputed the pace three wide between foes and came up empty in the lane. KHOSEA trailed
well off the rail.

Footnotes
BATTALION broke a step slow, crept closer to the leaders after six furlongs while swinging out four wide, collared MAJESTIC RO from outside leaving the
furlong grounds and edged clear. PLEASECALLMEBACK trailed early inside, moved to the far outside approaching the stretch, and finished well to go clear
of the rest. MAJESTIC RO grabbed the lead with an alert beginning, shook off bids from PALACE KITTEN and TROUBLE COFFEE coming off the far turn,
but was overhauled through the late stages. PALACE KITTEN prompted the pace from the outset, challenged between horses around the far turn, and
weakened through the stretch. TROUBLE COFFEE advanced three wide with a bid for the lead after six furlongs, but gave way after straightening away for
the drive. HARDREDCANDY found himself hemmed in and forced to steady along leaving the first turn and up the backstretch, found a seam in the
two-path looking poised to pounce on MAJESTIC RO in upper stretch, shortened stride while late changing leads and dropped back past the furlong marker.
HARD LIGHTING came under a ride inside on the far turn, and had no response.

Footnotes
UNCAPTURED SOLDIER dueled two wide between rivals early, angled to the rail and continued to knock heads with TRY ME from the three-eighths pole
to midstretch then drew off under a drive. TRY ME vied outside of the winner three wide early, two wide from the three-eighths pole and was no match
through the final furlong. CON PERMISO lacked early speed while racing two wide, angled three wide turning for home and was along for the show.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT disputed the pace inside of the top two finishers early, steadied nearing the three-eighths pole and faded inside. MASTER Q chased
the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. DREAMING THOUSAND never threatened while racing four wide. UNCAPTURED PULSE failed to
menace while racing three wide. FRATELLI A. A. broke slowly, raced four wide and was always outrun. ASTERISCO veered in at the start, saved ground
and made little impact. SUPER TRIPLE broke a beat slow and steadied off heels soon after the start and played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
WICKED MERCURY steadied between DE PURA SANGRE and SUNSET PROMISE approaching the wire for the first time, moved out three wide and
tracked the leaders around the first turn and up the backstretch, wrested command outside SUNSET PROMISE after six furlongs, and responded to hold
KITTEN'S FINEST safe. The latter moved out to the three-path leaving the first turn, stayed out in the course advancing around the far turn, had aim outside
the winner through the lane but did not have enough. TRISH THE DISH bumped with GYPSY WIFE at the start, went along near the two-path taking closer
order through the middle stages, came three wide off the far turn, moved in through the drive and finished evenly. GYPSY WIFE bumped with TRISH THE
DISH at the start, saved ground at the back early, moved out three then four wide on the far turn, and could not gain past the eighth-pole. SUNSET
PROMISE vied outside JIMMYSSMOKEDCARROT for a half-mile, reached a short lead entering the far turn, could not withstand WICKED MERCURY
coming to the quarter-pole and gave way. MERCY MERCY stepped back on her hind legs at the break and lunged coming out two or three lengths slow,
recovered and raced in striking range while reserved through the middle stages, but came up empty when roused. DE PURA SANGRE was forwardly
placed early inside, and tired soon after completing a half. JIMMYSSMOKEDCARROT set a pressured early pace inside, and retreated around the far turn.

MY LITTLE ROSE was off a step slow, tracked the pace from the rail, got through inside in upper stretch, slowly gained inside, struck the front near the
sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. GRAVEL GERTIE bumped with BEAUTIFUL ROSIE at the start, advanced three wide around the turn, had
aim outside in upper stretch but was outkicked. MYSTIC COMIN HOME set the a pressured pace along the rail, drifted slightly into the two path turning for
home, led past the eighth pole but yielded on both sides in the latter yards. HARTS N FLOWERS raced off the pace three and four wide, continued on the
left lead in the lane and never threatened. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE pressed the pace two wide and weakened in the lane. BEAUTIFUL ROSIE was bumped
at the start, raced two wide and played no factor.

Footnotes
TARANTINO became agitated and unseated the rider in the gate, bumped with WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN at the start, pursued HALCYON DIGEST from a
distance for a half-mile, ranged up outside that rival after six furlongs, took over in mid stretch and edged away. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN bumped with
TARANTINO at the start, advanced after a half-mile but wound up boxed in behind the leaders midway on the far turn, altered course to the two-path and
finished willingly inside the winner. HALCYON DIGEST tugged along building a lengthy lead through the early stages, fought back when challenged by
TARANTINO around the far turn and into upper stretch, but weakened on the rail through the last eighth of a mile. RISK MANAGER got riled up and
dislodged his rider in the gate, took closer order three wide approaching the stretch, but made no further gains. MAJOR FRONTIER was placed under a firm
hold as HALCYON DIGEST cleared to the early lead, moved off the inside leaving the far turn, had the three-path in upper stretch and weakened on his left
lead. SIR ROBERTO was a step slow at the start, and never reached contention. MISTER LEONARDO hit the right side of the gate and came out slowest,
gained mildly after six furlongs three then four wide, but faded through the lane.

Footnotes
QUARKY had early speed inside, rated back nearing the turn, saved ground in range around the bend, had a clear path inside through the lane, seized
command leaving the eighth pole and drew clear under a drive. PAY ANY PRICE disputed the pace between rivals down the backstretch, angled to the rail
early on the turn, dueled inside of FAIR CATCH around the turn, came into the lane in the two path, kicked away from the pace rival in upper stretch, was
collared from the inside by the winner near the eighth pole but stayed on willingly to hold second. KAUFY BEAN bumped with STORM BOARDER at the
start, raced well back inside then finished well at the rail to gain the show. LAST OPPORTUNITY (IRE) saved ground off the pace, swung out turning for
home, split rivals near the eighth pole, rallied and just missed third. SEVEN GEMS advanced three wide around the turn to bid nearing the quarter pole and
flattened out in the drive. CRYOGENIC raced two wide in midpack, swung out in upper stretch and was one-paced through the lane. FAIR CATCH dueled
outside of PAY ANY PRICE to upper stretch and weakened. STORM BOARDER (CHI) bumped then steadied at the start, raced two wide and failed to
menace. MR. TIP never threatened while racing three wide. SHARED LEGACY was outrun while racing three wide. CASH NOW chased the pace four wide
and retreated through the lane. VINNIE VAN GO played no factor while racing five wide.
