Footnotes
MY MAXAMILLION tucked in behind the leaders for six furlongs, slipped through on the rail to reach the front a furlong out and kicked clear under good
handling. LORD FLINTSHIRE got bumped between CHIPSHAPE and MILITARY COMMANDER and checked first time under the wire, saved ground
throughout and finished well. GOLDEN FIDDLE was squeezed back between horses at the break, trailed early inside, came three wide off the far turn and
finished willingly outside. WEIGHT OF GLORY prompted the pace outside I AM THE GREY to the stretch, and weakened in the late stages. CHIPSHAPE
bumped with LORD FLINTSHIRE and steadied going under the wire the first time, raced well back for six furlongs, and moved up through deep stretch
between horses. HE AIN'T NO SAINT raced three wide, steadied a quarter-mile out, and lacked a solid closing response. I AM THE GREY set the pace
inside to the stretch, gave way a furlong from home, pulled up in distress past the finish and was vanned off. QUINTO SOL moved out three then four wide
approaching the stretch, and could not gain. MARLON B was slowest to begin, and failed to make an impact. WESTERLY WIND broke outward, advanced
mildly four then five wide nearing the stretch, but could not sustain the rally. MILITARY COMMANDER exchanged bumps with LORD FLINTSHIRE early,
stayed in range to the stretch while shifting out three wide, and tired late. PARMENIDES was never prominent.

Footnotes
FLORIDA ENDEAVOUR bumped with WITHOUT PASSPORT and came away from the gate two lengths slow, advanced early inside, moved out three wide
joining the leaders at the top of the stretch, took over coming to the eighth-pole and drove clear. CON PERMISO moved off the inside around the turn,
challenged for command between horses after a half-mile, could not match strides with the winner past the furlong marker and ran on best of the others.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT dashed clear after an alert beginning, came under attack from two rivals approaching the stretch, and gave way inside. MASTER OF
DISASTER failed to threaten through a three-wide trip. VALEROSO showed early speed, but tired three wide before reaching the stretch. WITHOUT
PASSPORT bumped with FLORIDA ENDEAVOUR at the break and came out slowly, moved inside trailing on the turn and never got close.

Footnotes
ANTIGONE stalked the pace three wide, seized command nearing the three-eighths marker and drew off under a drive. ROYAL MISTRESS stalked the
early pace inside, made a rail bid nearing the half-mile pole, briefly led early on the turn, chased the winner inside from the three-eighths pole and held well
to be clearly second best. CALLMESENORITA trailed inside, moved up at the rail rounding the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed
rally. LA GATA NEGRA failed to menace while racing three wide. GREATER PLAN chased the pace two wide and was through after a half. WICKED
SPIRIT set the pace in the two path down the backstretch and retreated nearing the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
EMPIRE EXPRESS saved ground unhurried to the far turn, shifted out smoothly rallying between horses three wide at the top of the stretch, battled outside
PALACE KITTEN through the last eighth of a mile and proved narrowly best. PALACE KITTEN took control at the start, rated along inside for six furlongs,
repelled a challenge from ALL GOOD turning for home, dug in along the rail and fought gamely to the finish. RELIABILITY raced near the two-path at the
back early, moved out four wide with aim outside the leaders at the head of the stretch, but lacked a solid closing response. STRONG HEADED saved
ground to the far turn, went out three wide past the quarter-pole, and ran on evenly. SOUTH POINTE DRIVE stayed in range for six furlongs, and steadied
unable to hold his position leaving the far turn. ALL GOOD prompted the pace outside PALACE KITTEN, got shaken off by that one after straightening away
for the drive, and faded. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

WHISPERING PINES broke through the starting gate but did not get loose, was forced to steady off heels near the half-mile pole, was in range between
down the backstretch, angled out nearing the turn, advanced three wide around the bend, steadily gained outside in the stretch, seized command nearing
the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. EMMA ROSE reared in the gate and unseated the rider in apparent reaction to the winner breaking
through, had early speed two wide, dropped back around the turn, angled in near the three-eighths pole and re-rallied along the rail. MY ASHLEIGH set the
pace in the two path, led past the eighth pole and weakened late. TOURING EGYPT failed to menace while racing two wide. INTO CANDY stalked the pace
three wide, bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole and came up empty in the lane. AQAAREB trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SERENADE A KITTEN saved ground in range for six furlongs, came off the rail with a late bid between horses, and was up in the final strides. GLITTER
BAY grabbed the lead after the start, rated along clear to 70 yards out, and was nailed nearing the wire. COFFEE BUZZ BUZZ prompted the pace outside
GLITTER BAY, got shaken off turning for home, then stayed on with good courage outside the top two. PRETTY LIDDIE saved ground for six furlongs,
moved out leaving the far turn, and lacked the needed response. PHAROAH'S GOLD got bumped by KENTUCKY PRIDE at the start, lagged well back
inside for six furlongs, and gained mildly without becoming a factor. KENTUCKY PRIDE was bumped into PHAROAH'S GOLD by DARLA at the start, and
was never in the hunt. PANDORICA was never close, and tired before reaching the stretch. DARLA was bumped between horses at the start, and dropped
well back after a half-mile. SPECIAL INCLUSION broke in bumping DARLA into KENTUCKY PRIDE, stayed in range early three wide, and tired.

Footnotes
SMALL HOPE saved ground off the pace, smoothly angled out in upper stretch, rallied between foes, seized command near the sixteenth pole and held firm
under a drive. AUSTRIAN settled off the pace while racing two wide, went three wide around the far turn and finished well outside. IDLE TIME saved ground
in midpack, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied between rivals to gain the show. POSITIVE PHIL disputed the early pace inside, angled two wide early on
the backstretch as a foe cleared off, re-bid two wide around the far turn, dueled to the sixteenth pole and was swallowed up by closers. CAJUN EMBERS
set the pace well off the rail through the early stages, cleared off early on the backstretch, angled in nearing the far turn, dueled inside of POSITIVE PHIL to
midstretch and weakened. SPINNING KITTEN went evenly while racing three wide. CONVICT PIKE was bumped at the start, steadied incessantly while on
heels between rivals through the opening seven furlongs and never threatened. BABY BROTHER had early speed, rated back two wide and lacked a
closing bid. SAINT LARNED was bumped at the start, raced four wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
DANVILLE advanced inside after a half-mile, split horses and poked a head in front outside CREATE AGAIN coming to the quarter-pole, and edged away
through the stretch under pressure. CREATE AGAIN vied early inside INCUBATOR, got collared by DANVILLE shortly before completing six furlongs, and
had enough to save the place. WALKOFF raced three then four wide getting a bit closer to the leaders after six furlongs, but lacked a solid closing bid. IL
FARAONE lagged far back early inside, stayed inside putting in a run to upper stretch, but made no further gains. SNAP HOOK brushed with INCUBATOR
at the start, raced forwardly three wide to the top of the stretch, and faded. INCUBATOR volleyed for command outside CREATE AGAIN up the backstretch,
gave way around the turn, and had nothing left into the lane.

Footnotes
CANDACE O pressed the pace two wide, seized command near the quarter pole, vied outside of the pacesetter to midstretch, drew clear leaving the eighth
pole and dug in late to repel the runner-up. CADENCIA raced off the pace two wide for six furlongs, angled out in upper stretch, split rivals leaving the
three-sixteenths pole and finished strongly to erase most of the gap. CAUSINGAHULLBALOO stalked the pace three wide around both turns and finished
evenly to maintain the show. A THING OF BEAUTY was in range two wide early, went four wide around the far turn, stayed on between rivals through the
stretch but was outkicked. WOLFBANE hit the starting gate, raced well back two wide, circled five wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the
lane and flattened out a bit widest. ZIA'S SONG stalked the pace from the rail and lacked a rally. STUCK ON KITTEN set the pace inside of the winner and
weakened in the lane. CASH REFUND (GB) broke in a tangle, saved ground early, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. STARSHIP
NTERPRISE saved ground no avail. TALK RADIO played no factor while saving ground. SOUPER ALL STAR failed to menace while racing three and four
wide. HERE HERE checked early, saved ground well back and was never a threat.
