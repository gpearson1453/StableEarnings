Footnotes
WOOD NOT MIND raced off the pace in the two path through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn still in the two path, began a bid between
horses passing the quarter pole and gained ground quickly through the stretch to get up for the win in the final strides. PAULETTE led the field while saving
ground around the first turn, continued to show the way from the rail up the backstretch and around the far turn, opened up entering the stretch and was
caught in the final strides. LITTLE CHICK bobbled slightly leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch well off the
pace, began to improve position from the two path around the far turn and gained ground on the outside in late stretch. LION LOVE hopped up slightly
leaving the gate, raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, navigated the far turn from the two path
and finished evenly while never threatening the top three. DEVIL'S ROSE raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up
the backstretch and into the far turn, entered the stretch in the two path and faded in the final furlong. WILDWOOD SCAT trailed the field from the two path
around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and offered no bid. ANNIE TIME GIRL raced in the two path
around the first turn, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
KLONDIKE ANNIE was lightly bumped by HAL'S MISCHIEF in the opening strides, tracked well behind the leading pair down the backstretch and in the
three path on the turn, swung out four wide into upper stretch, rallied, led three wide at the sixteenth, and held sway. DON'T HOLD QUEENS settled at the
inside of the rear flight early, raced between horses in the rear flight into the turn, continued two wide around the bend, came into the lane between horses,
rallied three wide, altered four wide midstretch to get around KLONDIKE ANNIE, sustained her rally, and missed. AMERICAN HOLIDAY pressed the pace
outside of TRUE TO JEANINE until they were both overhauled by KLONDIKE ANNIE at the sixteenth mark, and chased on while no match late. TRUE TO
JEANINE sent for speed inside, set the pace to the sixteenth pole while pressured by AMERICAN HOLIDAY, was overhauled by the winner, and weakened
late. HAL'S MISCHIEF broke outward and bumped KLONDIKE ANNIE lightly in the opening strides, chased inside, settled back to the inside of the rear
flight into the turn, saved ground around the bend, improved under a drive in upper stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. CONSTANCIA broke slowly,
settled at the outside of the rear flight early, came three wide into the turn, found herself outpaced in the four path around the bend and offered no rally in
the lane. ICE ATTACK chased three wide early and in the four path on the turn, was driven three wide into the lane and emptied out.

HUEY ATTACK hit the gate at the break, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, began a bid while saving ground passing the three eighths
pole, took the lead on the rail with an eighth of a mile to go and held off a late closer to save the win. D' YANK raced in the middle of the pack between
horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, swung out in upper stretch to find racing room, and gained ground in late stretch while
drifting out mildly. CHANGE DIRECTION chased the leader up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid entering the stretch and
finished evenly, getting outkicked late. DAZZLING DIABLO sprinted to a clear early lead up the backstretch and into the turn, entered the stretch from the
two path, was caught with a furlong to go and continued to tire from there. COWBOY TUFF raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the
opening half mile, navigated the turn from the three path, began an outside bid approaching the quarter pole and flattened out in the stretch. MISTER
CHARMING trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. CLOUD TO GROUND trailed the field on the

Footnotes
NORTHERN ALLIANCE raced at the inside of the chasing flight, was pushed along while saving ground on the far turn, angled three wide in upper stretch,
rallied under a drive and took the lead just past the sixteenth pole. GOOD MONGOLIA sent to the lead, set a measured pace, went to a drive inside in upper
stretch, turned back CHLOBEE near midstretch, could not hold off NORTHERN ALLIANCE from just past the sixteenth but held the place. KINGSBURY
DREAM settled at the inside of the rear flight, continued in the two to three path with the rear flight on the far turn, was taken out to the eight path in upper
stretch, rallied under a drive, and gained all the way to the wire. ROMANTIC ATTACK chased midpack between horses, raced in the three path on the far
turn while still between horses, swung five wide into the lane, mustered a rally but was outkicked for the show. CHLOBEE tracked the pace, saved ground
behind the leader on the far turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, but weakened two wide in the final furlong. PRESENT OF HERO tracked the leading
pair two wide, was asked for a bid outside of GOOD MONGOLIA on the far turn, was driven four wide into the lane, proved no match for the pacesetter and
weakened in the final furlong. GO YEOWOMEN settled two wide in the rear flight, swung seven wide into upper stretch, and produced no rally.
TINDERELLA raced keenly into the first turn, chased three wide, began to flatten approaching the quarter pole, floated six wide into the lane and came up
empty.

Footnotes
GO FOR SHERRIE saved ground around the first turn, continued to duel for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn, kicked clear
in upper stretch and was kept to the task to the wire. MUSIAL raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack
on the outside, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole and gained ground on the outside in the stretch, the best of the rest. ANDREAS
pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn, continued to duel for the lead on the outside through the next half mile, entered the stretch in the
two path and weakened in the final sixteenth. SATURDAYS HANGOVER broke slowly, settled in to trail the field on the rail around the first turn and up the
backstretch, began to move up while saving ground around the far turn, made a mild bid entering the stretch and was outkicked from there. HIDE THE
EVIDENCE raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, came around the far turn still in the two path
and made no bid. FORGOT TO FORGET saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop
back while racing in the two path around the far turn and continued to tire in the stretch.

YOU'RE KILLIN ME was bumped by CAMPIONI in the opening strides, settled near the rear inside, was pushed along from the inside while still near the
rear on the far turn, swung six wide in upper stretch, rallied well under a drive, led approaching the sixteenth pole and ran clear. SPLASH FOR GOLD came
out slightly in the opening strides, chased behind and outside of YOU SPLIT TENS, bid three wide into the far turn, led three wide past the five sixteenths,
continued on a narrow lead past midstretch, was caught by YOU'RE KILLIN ME approaching the sixteenth but chased on a clear second best. YOU SPLIT
TENS tracked the leading pair, raced behind the leading line into the far turn, came three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top two but kept
on with enough interest to prove best of the rest. PLEASANT MOON set a pressured pace inside of PENALTY SHOT to the five sixteenths, was headed by
SPLASH FOR GOLD from there, kept on doggedly inside of the new leader to the furlong mark, and weakened inside. CAMPIONI broke in and bumped
YOU'RE KILLIN ME in the opening strides, was in tight between that foe and ZANFORCE, settled near the rear, began to improve three wide into the far
turn, swung out further and rallied six wide to midstretch, and flattened out late. SHELL FIRE broke slightly outward, settled near the rear between horses,
continued in the rear flight in the six path on the far turn, bid from the five sixteenths, came six wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick in the final
furlong. PENALTY SHOT hounded outside the leader until weakening near the five sixteenths. FORT RIDGE was put in tight between horses in the opening
strides, raced three wide through the first turn, continued to chase well off the rail down the backstretch, bid three wide into the far turn, and flattened out
three wide in the lane. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS was herded out in the opening strides, chased inside of DOLLAR BLUE. was driven inside into the far turn
and raced at the inside of the chasing flight through the bend, and weakened into the lane. DOLLAR BLUE chased midpack outside of
LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS, raced between horses into the far turn, and weakened in the three to four path around that bend. ZANFORCE broke inward,
settled near the rear early, raced three wide into the backstretch, continued in the five path between horses on the far turn and mustered no bid.

Footnotes
MIZ BLUE raced to a clear early lead up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and continued to draw away from her rivals down the lane, in
command throughout. COWGIRL KIMMIE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid between
horses passing the quarter pole and improved position in the stretch, while no match for the winner. RAGGEDY DOLL PEACH raced in the middle of the
pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path, swung wider still into the stretch and gained ground late on the outside.
AWESOME INDRA chased the leader between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn and finished evenly.
TIZALADYBUG chased the frontrunner on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, continued on in upper stretch and
weakened in the final sixteenth. AUNT DOROTHY chased the leader on the inside early, dropped back slightly while racing in the three path on the turn and
was outkicked from there. RACHELGOTSTEPHEN trailed the field in the opening stages on the outside, began a mild bid from the three path around the
turn and flattened out in the final furlong. WHITE LIES raced in the back of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn between horses in
the two path and never fired. POINT STREAK hopped up at the break, recovered to settle at the back of the pack on the inside for the run up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
VERRAZANO FIRST broke out and bumped BULLDOG OF BERGEN in the opening strides, tracked MEGAN'S HONOR in the opening furlong, advanced
to press outside him past the five eighths, dueled two wide through the turn and while driven into upper stretch, inherited the lead past the three sixteenths
when MEGAN'S HONOR went to a protective hold, and held sway. ARCHIEMYBOY chased outside of RICHIESGOTSWAGGER early, continued midpack
in the four path on the turn, came into the lane in the five path, and rallied under a drive while drifting out. IWILLPERSEVERE settled at the rear of the main
group, saved ground through the turn, began to rally past the three eighths, came into the lane in the two path, forced RICHIESGOTSWAGGER out in upper
stretch when coming out for room, kept on while proving no match for VERRAZANO FIRST, but was outkicked for the place. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER
tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, came into the lane in the three path, was forced out in upper stretch as
IWILLPERSEVERE was coming out for room, and was outfinished in the final furlong. PRESIDENT ELECT broke slowly, settled at the inside of the rear
flight trailing well behind the main group, remained in the trailing pair in the two path on the turn, and lacked the needed rally in the stretch. BULLDOG OF
BERGEN was bumped by VERRAZANO FIRST in the opening strides, settled outside of PRESIDENT ELECT in the rear flight far behind the main group,
continued in the trailing pair in the three to four path on the turn, and had no bid in the lane. MEGAN'S HONOR broke outward, was sent for speed inside,
took pressure from VERRAZANO FIRST past the five eighths, dueled inside of that foe around the turn and into the lane, was brushed by that foe in upper
stretch while being urged to keep up, was suddenly put to a protective hold just past the three sixteenths and allowed to fade inside, and walked off the
course under his own power.

bid between horses entering the stretch, and took over in the final furlong. GREAT SCAT raced between horses in the middle of the pack in the early
stages, navigated the turn from the three path and gained ground rapidly on the outside in the final furlong. DRAMA STAR stalked the leaders on the inside
up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began an outside bid nearing the quarter pole and chased the winner home. MUTAKDDIM ROAD
raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path and improved position in late stretch. OFFLEE
