Footnotes
PHILO never far back, held position on the two path through the second turn, angled out into the stretch to bid four wide, made a steady gain and drifted out
while driving clear in upper stretch. PAPA JOEL well placed and outside, held position three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the
lane, then lacked the late kick need and held the place. BRANDT allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest
into the lane, made a steady gain, then flattened. TIP SHEET stalked the early pace on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead into the second turn, then
weakened the final furlong and held a share. NICOLE MUNNINGS set the early pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the second turn, came
again to gain a short lead, then faded the final furlong. KELA BREW well placed, steadily lost ground. INSPIRATO (MEX) was never involved.

Footnotes
CHARGE IT ALL broke inwards bumping MARKETABILITY, was quickly righted to track the first flight from out of striking distance racing through the
backstretch, steadily advanced on the leader entering the turn, moved to challenge for command three wide nearing upper stretch, dispatched a rival's
challenge approaching the furlong marker and edged away under firm left handed pressure. SPECIAL PRINCESS, brushed at the start, was settled last
near the inside in the opening quarter, shifted out entering the turn steadily gaining momentum, angled to the four path entering the stretch and continued
with interest to close the gap while prevailing for the place honors. MARKETABILITY, bumped, then squeezed between rivals at the start losing some
position, was righted to steadily advance racing into the turn, gained position between rivals nearing upper stretch, bid for command along the rail entering
the lane but flattened out in the last furlong. SPLASH CASH, urged forcing the pace outside a rival from the outset into the turn, edged forward to a narrow
advantage midway through the turn but gave way once headed by the winner racing into upper stretch. MY GLORY broke outwards exchanging contact with
MARKETABILITY at the start, settled well off the leaders racing through the backstretch and failed to mount a rally. R AVERIE LYNN, reluctant to load in the
starting gate, broke inwards brushing SPECIAL PRINCESS, was righted, then urged disputing the pace inside a rival through the backstretch but emptied
out abruptly after three furlongs.

Footnotes
MADAME ROUGE broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing in the three path racing to the turn, shifted inwards on the bend edging away
to a clear advantage while remaining a bit off the rail, then held sway through the lane, widening under pressure. PURPLE PEOPLEEATER gained a
forward placing prompting the pacesetter in the four path, then the three path into the turn, couldn't match terms with that foe after a half but prevailed for
the place honors and was taken in hand nearing the wire once the issue was decided. TENERIFE MOON settled outside foes in the opening furlong, shifted
inwards leaving the midway point of the turn gaining momentum, angled inside the leaders entering upper stretch to lodge a bid along the rail but was
outkicked for the place honors. SHARON'S LAW was rated off the second flight in the opening stages, was prompted to advance while angling to the four
path nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. APOLLO U ANYWHERE tracked off the first flight three wide racing to the turn, angled inside the
leaders nearing upper stretch and quickly emptied out. LADY MIAH tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and steadily faded nearing the lane.
BLAZING DIVA was settled last after the opening furlong and failed to menace thereafter. TAYLOR'S FIRST angled to the inside in the opening stages
tracking just off the first flight but retreated early.

Footnotes
INITFORTHELOVE, urged between foes from the outset prompting the pace into the first turn, continued between foes to the far turn, pressed the issue
outside a rival racing into upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and went clear late under firm encouragement. SANTO angled inwards tracking off the
first flight between rivals just off the inside racing to the far turn, shifted out exchanging contact with SYMBOL AZTECA nearing upper stretch, then
continued to exchange contact repeatedly through the stretch but narrowly prevailed between foes for the place honors on the wire. SYMBOL AZTECA was
rated off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position three wide between entering the far turn, was bumped nearing
upper stretch, then shifted inwards exchanging repeated contact with SANTO through the final three sixteenths while being just outfinished for the place
honors. TIDES OF WAR, urged inside foes racing to the first turn disputing the pace, edged forward to a narrow advantage racing through the backstretch,
dueled for command leaving the far turn past midstretch but weakened in late stages. PARADE GRAND, shuffled back avoiding close quarters at the start,
settled along the rail to the backstretch, angled out six wide racing into upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. CURLEE FOX, urged
five wide between foes racing to the first turn, was taken back entering that band to race outside rivals to the backstretch, shifted inwards nearing the lane to
split foes just off the inside but had no late bid. DIVINE CONTROL, urged three wide between foes into the first turn pressing the pace, continued to prompt
the leaders in that path to the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. TWO STEP DANCE, caught six wide while being prompted to terms with the first flight
racing into the first turn, lost some ground to the leaders racing four deep to the backstretch, advanced that path to gain striking distance racing into the far
turn but emptied out nearing upper stretch. FACTOR MAN tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening half and steadily faded racing into the far
turn. KHOZANITO, urged four wide between foes to gain terms with the first flight racing into the first turn, dropped out early.

Footnotes
PREFERRED OUTCOME, in touch with the first flight between foes in the opening stages, was eased back after the opening furlong to track just off those
rivals, shifted out four wide on the turn steadily gaining on the leaders, then continued in that path producing a steady late response to wear down UNCLE
HAL in time under strong handling. UNCLE HAL broke readily, vied for command three wide between foes in the opening stages, pressed the issue
between foes on the turn, edged clear racing into upper stretch but was just collared nearing the wire. SILVER DEFENSE tracked off the first flight between
foes in early stages, gained position between rivals racing into upper stretch but had no final kick. ARAZI LIKE MOVE settled last racing to the turn, angled
outside foes entering the stretch and made some belated progress. MINES MADE UP, urged inside foes disputing the pace racing into the turn, gave way
into upper stretch. I'M CARDINAL joined the pace four wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue three deep racing through the turn to upper stretch and
gave way. WILD WIGGLIN JACK tracked off the first flight inside foes but offered no rally. SUSPECT A STORM tracked off the first flight racing five wide
into the turn and retreated into the lane.

Footnotes
COOL FRONT broke awkwardly, was settled last racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum switching outside rivals racing into the far turn, swung out
to the eight path in upper stretch and produced a stout rally to wrest the advantage and go clear in time under firm encouragement. C'EST PARTI tracked
just off the second flight between foes under light rating to the backstretch, continued under patient handling angling out on the far turn, shifted to the five
path entering the stretch, moved to challenge for command midstretch striking the front between calls late but couldn't match the winner's final kick. SOUTH
HOUSE joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival into the far turn, shifted to the inside disputing the issue inside
foes to midstretch but yielded late. TIZ HERSELF settled into stride off the inside racing into the backstretch, angled out entering upper stretch, then altered
course six wide midstretch avoiding some traffic to gain position to the end. CHARLITA tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing to the
backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch, steadied when losing her path to PRETTY PRINCESS nearing the furlong marker losing
momentum and was outkicked for a share. PRETTY PRINCESS was rated off the second flight in the opening half, shifted outside foes rallying smartly
three deep to challenge for command in upper stretch, drifted out under left handed pressure impeding CHARLITA leaving the furlong marker and quickly
flattened out. ESTILO DE MUJER, urged between foes from the outset pressing the pace to the backstretch, dueled inside a rival into the far turn and gave
way into upper stretch. RIO DEL ARMOUR settled near the inside in the opening half and offered no rally. BELLA SERENA, forwardly placed along the rail,
eased off the first flight midway through the first turn, was then urged to press the issue inside foes midway through the backstretch but was spent early.
LUSTROUS tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening half and steadily faded racing into the far turn. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER
OF CHARLITA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF C'EST PARTI ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM
WAS DISALLOWED.

PAPAJUDGY was urged inside foes from the outset disputing the pace, dueled for command into the stretch and edged away to a narrow advantage
nearing the wire to prevail after a prolonged drive. AIN'T WASTING TIME tracked just off the second flight racing through the backstretch, steadily advanced
to contention four wide nearing upper stretch, couldn't gain terms with the winner but edged a rival for second nearing the wire. FELON joined the pace
three wide in the opening quarter, pressed the issue in that path into upper stretch but yielded nearing the wire. CHINOMADITO broke a step slowly when it
appeared his head was turned at the start, settled outside foes racing well off the second flight, angled out five wide nearing the lane and steadily improved
position to the end. IMPERIAL IVOR was under pressure in early stages dropping off the second flight while angling inside on the backstretch, shifted out to
race three deep between foes entering the lane and improved position to the end. STORM RISK tracked off the second flight three wide between foes
racing to the turn, was fanned four wide between foes into the lane and continued evenly. FLUENT IN SARCASM, urged between foes from the outset
pressing the pace, dueled to upper stretch and gave out late. ANDRES ROMAN, off slowly, proved no factor. WHISKEY BENT tracked the leaders between
foes in second flight racing into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. BROADWAY PETE tracked off the first flight inside foes in the opening quarter,
saved ground on the turn and emptied out racing into upper stretch. KEYLARGO settled outside foes in the last flight and retreated early.

CURLY RUTH was rated just off the second flight between rivals, then near the inside in the opening five furlongs, angled out four wide racing into upper
stretch while being prompted to advance, came through tight quarters nearing the sixteenth marker to wrest the advantage and edged STORMY D under
firm encouragement. The latter was settled inside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum while swinging out five wide in upper
stretch, came around some traffic in the closing stages to challenge for command but proved only second best. PUGILIST broke readily, dictated the pace
on a narrow margin along the inside, maintained the advantage to midstretch, ducked out under pressure nearing the sixteenth marker shifting into the path
of THREE QUARTER TIME while forcing that rival into the path of CANDY FLOWER and yielded to the top pair late. THREE QUARTER TIME stalked the
pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight racing to the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing the lane, came through inside foes in upper
stretch, then shifted out to bid between foes leaving midstretch, was steadied sharply when shut off by the pacesetter nearing the sixteenth marker bumping
CANDY FLOWER and couldn't recover in time. CANDY FLOWER raced three deep as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced
in that path to challenge nearing midstretch, was, bumped, then squeezed while being forced to check out of tight quarters nearing the sixteenth marker and
lost all momentum. QUEEN OF CAUSE settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. RAIN DANCE, in touch between
foes attending the pace for six furlongs, gave way into upper stretch. TANAGER was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch but
dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN WHILE THE RIDER OF THREE
QUARTER TIME LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF PUGILIST. AFTER REVIEWING THE INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH, THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED PUGILIST FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM FIFTH.

Footnotes
REGAL SPEAKER shied outwards slightly at the start, recovered quickly to gain a position three deep in second flight racing to the backstretch, continued
under patient handling to the far turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch while being prompted to advance,. wrested the advantage and went clear under
firm encouragement. BUC'S INVESTMINT was rated off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, conceded some position saved ground into
the far turn, shifted off the inside entering upper stretch, angled five wide nearing the sixteenth marker and continued with a steady late response to prevail
for second. FLY NIGHTLY tracked off the second flight racing to the backstretch, gained position between foes after a half, angled to the rail nearing upper
stretch and continued to improve position to the closing stages while altering course avoiding traffic in late stages. VIOLATOR led the second flight into the
backstretch, steadily gained on the leaders three wide racing into the far turn, struck the front nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. BIG
TALL DAWG, pulled his way to the lead along the inside, dueled for command inside foes through the backstretch into the far turn, resisted a rival's
challenge entering upper stretch but gave out in the closing stages. SUN SQUALL, reserved along the inside early, shifted out on the backstretch to race
between foes but offered no rally. IMPERIAL GUARD angled inwards to prompt the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, pressed between foes through the
far turn and gave way nearing midstretch. WHATA PERFECT DAY, off a bit slowly, raced three wide between foes in the last flight into the backstretch and
faded into the lane. HELLFIRE BOB, caught four wide tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, drifted out to the six path racing into the lane
and quickly came up empty. VICTORY TOUR trailed throughout.
