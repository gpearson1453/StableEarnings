Footnotes
KANDY CHARGE never far back, closed willingly in the four path on the far turn and into the stretch, made the lead just past the furlong marker and drew off
under energetic left handed urging. BUCKEYE KITTEN made the lead on the clubhouse turn, set the pace along the inside to the furlong maker then was no
match for the winner. HEIDI'S SINATRA allowed to settle, drifted out to the seven path while moving closer under strong left handed urging entering the
stretch and finished with good courage. HIGH DOLLAR went evenly. OLE WATASHI chased the winner two wide into the stretch then weakened. POWERS
OUT stalked the pace along the inside for six furlongs then gave way. PRECIOUS JULES trailed.

Footnotes
CUTIE PIE prompted the pace three wide into the stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker and won under a strong hand ride. HOPES AND
PRAYERS close up four wide, dropped back on the turn, came on again through deep stretch and finished clear for second. DUE NORTH pressed the pace
four then three wide and finished with good courage. PRAIRIE CITIZEN with the second flight three wide, lacked the needed response. NATALIA'S
TEMPLE had speed along the rail from the start, also dropped back on the turn, altered course sharply to the three path near the furlong marker then
finished evenly. FACEYS FIRST slow early, swung wide and closed a gap late. SUMMER HOURS was hustled to the front two wide soon after the start, set
the pace to the top of the stretch then was used up.

Footnotes
JEDI TEMPLE had his head turned at the start, was on heels entering the clubhouse turn, shifted outside, rushed to the lead before a half, set the balance
of the pace and widened through the stretch under left handed urging to win as much the best. CONNORRSKIE never far back, rallied along the inside into
the stretch and finished second best. OUR PETITION well placed, finished with good courage three wide. ROAD OF DIAMONDS stalked pace the into the
stretch and faded in the final stages. MOBIL MAGIC had brief speed. EL CHEAPO was no factor. LETSGETITSEVENTEEN was unprepared for the start,
broke in a tangle, bore in and was outrun. PLAYERS HERO set the early pace, had speed for six furlongs then stopped.

and drew clear. NOBLE BEHAVIOR close up from the start, loomed boldly four wide into the stretch and finished second best. FIRST ANGEL settled just off
the dueling leaders into the turn, shifted out dive wide, rallied to make the lead in upper stretch then was outfinished. PRETTY STORMY stalked the pace
near the inside into the stretch, lacked racing room behind rivals before the furlong marker then finished evenly. ROTTEN SCOUNDREL failed to menace.
VAPOR POINT broke in front, battled for the lead three wide into the stretch and weakened late. TOTALLY was bounced around between horses at the
start, stumbled, rushed to contention between rivals two wide before a quarter, prompted the pace into the stretch then tired. TOWN DANCER bore out at
the start bumping rivals, rushed to the lead before a quarter, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was used up. JOSHUABULLIEVED trailed.

after a half. GRADY'S LADY away alertly, set the pace for four and one half furlongs then flattened out. HEAVEN SENT ANGEL suffered an injury shortly

Footnotes
IM NO SAINT never far back, closed willingly three wide through the stretch and drew clear under right handed urging. NO TREBLE dueled for the lead two
wide until upper stretch then finished clearly second best. TRINNI DANCER settled mid pack, began to rallied along the rail into the stretch, lacked racing
room a furlong out and lost momentum. CAPTAIN WES went evenly in the six path. MAGIC TRAIN dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch and
weakened late. PERFECT PAL failed to menace. EL SANGRU passed tiring rivals. FINALLY was no threat. L. L. B. STORM was no factor. TALK FAST
stalked the pace three wide into the stretch then faltered. ROARING OCEAN was outrun. RISING PRODIGY was through early and stopped in the stretch.
