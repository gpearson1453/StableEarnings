Footnotes
MAST COVE was rated stalking just off the first flight from between foes racing to the turn, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a
steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm right handed pressure. GLORY ROLL broke sharply, prompted the pace outside a rival
racing to the turn, pressed the issue on the bend to edge forward nearing midstretch but was collared by the winner in the final sixteenth. DO WHAT IT
TAKES tracked off the second flight between foes and continued with an effort to gain position to the end. MZ. FOO DO, urged to the lead from the break
while angling to the inside, dueled for command on the turn into upper stretch and weakened late. KWAINA settled last racing to the turn, angled out to the
five path in upper stretch but passed only tiring rivals. MOON OVER VICTORIA tracked off the first flight three wide between foes in the opening quarter but
faded nearing the stretch. TEE UP settled near the inside early, saved ground to the lane but lacked the needed late response. ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA
was a brief factor four wide early and faded into upper stretch.

Footnotes
BIONIC BOTTLE, in touch with the pacesetter three deep in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside that foe on the turn into upper stretch and went
well clear late under some right handed pressure. SHE'S AN ALPHA, forwardly placed along the inside stalking just off the first flight, shifted out three deep
racing into the lane and continued well enough to edge a rival for the place honors nearing the wire. WORKINONBEINSINGLE broke sharply, angled
inwards dictating the pace on a narrow advantage between foes through the backstretch, dueled for command inside the eventual winner on the turn to
upper stretch and gave way late. HYPERLOOP tracked just off the first flight four wide in early stages, shifted inwards on the bend, was fanned four wide
midstretch and faded in the closing stages. R D BLESSING settled along the inside early and never gained contention. DAWNDETTI shifted out four wide
racing to the turn tracking off the second flight but offered no rally.

Footnotes
FREELANCE raced four deep leaving the chute, angled inwards gaining terms with the pacesetter attending that rival's tempo under light rating racing to the
backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn, went clear racing into upper stretch shifting to the three path late but maintained a safe margin under
pressure. YOUNG THOMAS was rated between foes dropping off the second flight to the backstretch, angled outside foes nearing the lane, shifted inwards
in upper stretch to split foes bidding inside the winner leaving midstretch and prevailed for the place honors while moving to close the gap. FORMAL
TREASURE was settled last near the inside, switched out on the backstretch, rallied four wide through the far turn to briefly loom outside the eventual
winner but evened out in the closing stages. BEAUTY GENIUS was rated off the first flight along the inside, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch to
make brief progress between foes but flattened out in the drive. HANDSOME EFFORT settled near the inside early and never gained contention. EXIT
RIGHT, forwardly placed between foes racing to the first turn, was eased off the leaders to track those foes near the inside into the backstretch but faded
from contention early. MI CLEOPATRA AND I tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch but faded early. HEATHER'S GOLD, urged to
the lead along the rail racing to the first turn, dueled for command along the rail on the far turn and gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
WHISPERING ROSE was rated just off the second flight while between foes racing to the backstretch, angled out on the far turn while being prompted to
advance, was fanned five wide entering upper stretch but continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under firm right handed encouragement.
MARIALUISA tracked just off the pacesetter three deep in the opening half, steadily advanced in that path to challenge leaving the midway point of the far
turn, gained a narrow advantage, then resisted several challenges into the stretch but just failed to contain the winner. DREAMINOFDASIES settled last
near the inside after the opening quarter, shifted outside some tiring foes to split rivals just off the inside gaining position inside the top pair entering the
stretch and prevailed for a share. KAUFY FUTURES tracked the pacesetter along the rail in the opening half, switched outside foes entering the far turn to
lodge a brief, four wide bid nearing upper stretch, pressed the issue past midstretch but flattened out late. BIZ MAKER angled to the inside tracking off the
second flight racing to the backstretch but offered no closing bid. U S S LOIS, urged to the lead from between foes in the opening furlong, angled to the rail
setting the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch and gave way once headed on the far turn. BIG BOSS LADY settled outside foes in early stages,
raced four wide through the backstretch gaining some position after a half but lacked a closing response. THE ROVING KIND, pulling against restraint
between foes stalking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, prompted the pace between foes racing into the far turn and gave way abruptly into the lane.

Footnotes
DONYA'S MAGIC sped clear of the field while angling to the inside leaving the chute, held sway on a commanding advantage racing to the far turn, was
roused when challenged by a rival nearing upper stretch to regain a clear margin entering the lane, shifted out under left handed pressure in the closing
stages drifting momentarily into the path of GOLDEN OLDIE but held that rival on a safe margin under firm handling. The latter was rated inside rivals
tracking the pacesetter from out of striking distance as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, steadily close the gap shifting off the inside to bid
between foes nearing upper stretch, couldn't match the winner in the drive while being floated out late but proved best of the others. PATSY'S BIG GIRL,
caught in close quarters between foes, then forced out four wide racing into the first turn, steadily gained position three wide racing to the far turn, angled
nearer to the inside to advance inside the leaders entering the stretch and prevailed for a share. BEAUTIFUL TIZ, caught in close quarters, then a bit rank
between foes under restraint racing to the first turn shifting into the path of PATSY'S BIG GIRL, was righted to track off the second flight racing between
foes to the far turn and gained some position late in an even effort. BEE DANNA, held up along the rail when caught in tight quarters nearing the first turn,
continued inside foes under light rating to the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn while being prompted to advance three deep into the stretch but lacked
the needed late kick. EL VALOR settled outside foes in early stages, was fanned five wide into the stretch but offered no rally. ANGEL EMBRACE tracked
off the the second flight between foes, made brief progress three wide to lodge a brief bid racing into the far turn but emptied out nearing upper stretch.
SAETA tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight racing to the backstretch but dropped back early. INPENDING BREEZE tracked off the second
flight between foes to the backstretch but retreated early. GOLD COUNTRY tracked off the second flight along the inside but emptied out after a half.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
DIAMOND ORE was rated off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, steadily gained terms with the leaders three deep midway through the
far turn, moved to challenge for command in that path nearing upper stretch, contested the issue outside rivals in a prolonged drive past midstretch but
edged forward late to prevail under firm left handed encouragement. PURTIZ broke sharply, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin along the inside to
the backstretch, then grudgingly resisted when challenged on the far turn to late stages but proved only second best. FORBIDDEN DREAM stalked the
pacesetter outside a rival in the opening half, advanced readily to bid for command between foes nearing upper stretch, contested the issue in a protracted
skirmish past midstretch but weakened nearing the wire. BABY GUNDIN was rated stalking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, shifted sharply to the
inside after a half, continued under patient handling conceding some position racing into the far turn, shifted out four wide racing into the stretch and
continued with a mild bid to close the gap late. ZARELLA, firmly rated off the second flight nearest the inside racing to the backstretch, had no closing bid.
SCENIC OVERLOOK, unsettled in the gate prior to the start, broke in the air while losing position to the field, switched out widest racing to the backstretch
but never gained contention. J D'S VISTA, pulling against rating while going erratically between foes behind the second flight racing to the backstretch,
dropped out early.

Footnotes
KENDAMA was settled in the last flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, angled out racing into the far turn gathering momentum, advanced on the
leaders four wide nearing upper stretch, lugged inwards a bit in the closing stages but was corrected while continuing with a steady late response to
narrowly prevail in time under firm handling. MARKSMAN, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, pressed the
issue between foes entering the far turn to gain a narrow advantage, then resisted several challengers in sustained drive to the wire to just miss. DA
ALPHA, a bit unruly in the paddock, gained a forward placing three tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, advanced in that path to
challenge for command leaving the far turn, dueled between foes into the stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. MADE MY DAY (IRE) was rated
between foes in second flight in the opening half, drew into striking distance while awaiting an opening leaving the midway point of the far turn and lacked
the needed final kick. BATTLE CREEK hopped at the start, settled outside foes in the second flight and continued evenly between foes into the lane.
THAT'S BUCKBEAK broke sharply, angled to the rail setting the pace on a clear margin racing to the backstretch, briefly resisted when challenged but gave
way racing into the stretch. RECORDER tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening half and steadily faded racing into the far turn.
ALLGORILLA, firmly rated outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, offered no rally.

Footnotes
MOZANO was rated stalking just off the pacesetter into the backstretch, shifted out to wrest the advantage entering the far turn, went clear into the stretch
and widened late under mild urging. SUPER SHOES, urged to the lead near the inside racing to the backstretch, proved no match when confronted by the
winner on the far turn but continued with interest along the inside to prove best of the others. NO TIME TO YAWN tracked off the second flight three wide
racing to the backstretch, advanced in that path into the far turn, then four wide into the lane but continued evenly. SOLE SEEKER was rated off the second
flight along the inside, shifted out three wide racing into the far turn to split rivals but lacked the needed late bid. PRIVATE ASTRAY settled outside foes
racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. IFEELGOOD, fractious when being saddled in the paddock, was forwardly placed three wide tracking just off
the pacesetter in the opening stages, continued in second flight racing four, then five wide through the far turn and gave way into the lane. MY CHITU
tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch but emptied out early. JUST CALL ME HOMER proved no factor. ALL STARR RUNNER
dropped out early.

WITH REWARD was urged to the lead while angling inside leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a clear margin to the backstretch, continued inside foes
on a narrow advantage through the far turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch but maintained the advantage to the end under right handed
encouragement. DISCO'S BRIDGE stalked the pacesetter inside a rival as part of the second flight, came through to bid inside that foe racing into upper
stretch but proved only second best. RED HOOD tracked just off the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced to press the
issue between foes on the far turn but flattened out in the drive. KING ANDRES, reserved between foes to the backstretch, steadily gained position splitting
rivals racing into the far turn but finished evenly through the stretch. LORD BYRON tracked the leaders between rivals just off the second flight in the
opening half, advanced three wide racing into the far turn to lodge a brief bid but flattened out nearing the lane. EL FEFO switched out four wide racing into
the first turn and never gained contention. RECLINER settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, angled out five wide entering the lane but offered no
rally. COURAGEOUS CRAFT tracked off the second flight along the inside but steadily faded after a half. DRILL BIT proved no factor. EL SOLO UNO
tracked off the second flight racing three wide to the backstretch but soon retreated.
