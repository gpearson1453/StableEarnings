Footnotes
PONCHO SONG tracked the front runners from along the inside route, angled out springing from the five-sixteenths pole as a revved-up TRADEWAR was
in the first stages of a prolonged retreat, settled into the two path at the head of the stretch and was given her cue, wore down the leader inside the eighth
pole, edged clear. AMITY ISLAND took up the chase two wide on the turn, swung about wide into the stretch, rallied well enough to get up for the place in
the final few jumps. ROSIES SURPRISE stalked the pace towards the back of the pack from path two, got cued up for the drive home, drifted out down the
stretch while weakening into the show slot. ROSEY'S PEACH spar from path two for command, wrested away the advantage late on the bend, was put to a
drive for the drive, was reeled in inside the eighth pole, then steadily weakened. BELLAMY'SPARTYGIRL forwardly placed three wide, got outfinished after
stepping into the stretch. QUASHANA brushed with TRADEWAR shortly after the field had been sent on its way, raced two wide onto the turn, was worked
into path five from upper to midstretch, made no headway. GABBY'SGOLDENVOICE towards the three path at the top of the turn, gave way. QUARANTINA
quickly spotted along the inside route, was never heard from. WISH FOR MAGIC hung out four wide on the turn, gave way. TRADEWAR lost her footing
after making light contact with another in the shadow of the starting gate, cut over to the rail with the advantage, vied for control until right around the
five-sixteenths pole, went into the stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
PALLAS ATHENE settled unhurried at the tail of the field early on, saved ground through the opening bend before tipping out to the four path down the
backstretch racing in the clear, began to advance nearing the half mile pole, tucked three wide through the turn and advanced on the front under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, cornered three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to steadily wear down the leader through the final furlong taking
command in the last jumps to prevail on the wire. MY CANDY GIRL coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, remained patiently
handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under growing threat through the final eighth and was caught in the
final strides to the finish while clear of the rest for the place honors. MICROMILLION brushed the near side stall at the start when breaking inwards and
bumped lightly with FIVE ALARM ROBIN, went three wide through the first turn then raced three then two wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the late stages. BLAME THE GODS tracked the pace along the inside
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. FIVE ALARM ROBIN bumped lightly at the start by
MICROMILLION, who broke inwards, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home
and offered no rally. SKY KITTEN broke in at the start and was corrected, chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide
into upper stretch and weakened. PATRONA two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
LOVE AND LOVE sparred for command from the two path, challenged in earnest coming up to the three-sixteenths pole, wrested away the advantage,
steadily extended the winning margin, kept to the task at hand. SINGULAR SENSATION secured a forward position, pursued the pace from path three, was
asked to pick it up leaving the five-sixteenths marker, went into the stretch and got staved off. MY ROXY GIRL gained control after stumbling the start,
showed the way, prompted by the winner to her outside, succumbed when put to the test by that opponent in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole,
weakened into the show slot. PUFFERY eyed the pacesetter for three-quarters while taking the inside route, tipped into the two path for the drive, came up

Footnotes
TENDERFOOT three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive on the wrong lead unwilling
to switch or tip out as INVALUABLE drifted in front a furlong out, took to the inside of that rival and rallied to challenge for the front taking command seventy
yards from home, then inched away to the finish. INVALUABLE broke out a step at the start forcing BLOOD MOON to be taken in hand when in tight
between foes as OUR COUNTRY broke in at the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside patiently handled, swung three then two wide straightened
away into upper stretch, got roused nearing the eighth pole, dug in under a drive drifting out despite an off sided stick and was caught in the final seventy
yards to the finish while well clear of the rest for the place honors. OUR COUNTRY broke in at the start forcing BLOOD MOON to be taken in hand in
tandem with INVALUABLE who broke outwards, chased four paths off the inside briefly before tucking to the two path, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, offered up a bid swinging four wide into upper stretch, then flattened in the final furlong while along for the show honors. MIAMI MUMBLES
chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, weakened. ALBIE chased along the inside from near the
rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened to the finish while passing tired rivals. FRIED RICE
KING chased three then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired. TITAN'S WILL chased four then five wide
under a ride from the three-eighths, cornered four wide for home and tired. BLOOD MOON broke a beat slow and was steadied at the start when rivals each
broke his way, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, went four
wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DREAMS OF TOMORROW two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, advanced on the leader on tandem with MY BOY PADDY seven-sixteenths
from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole taking command when set down swinging four wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to
the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. BAY STREET MONEY tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied willingly to cut into the winner's margin while along clear of the rest and second best. ROYALE
four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors.
JOHNNYPUMP coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide until tucked inside three furlongs from home, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch
and offered up a mild bid. BAIL OUT four to five wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened.
HIGH TIDE just off the inside early on, tipped four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking back to the two path through the far turn, got
coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. AMERICAN PIPER established the front and showed the way in
hand along the inside, was in the midst of backing the pace down when displaced by a pair with seven-sixteenths to go, remained patiently handled inside
through the turn, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. MY BOY PADDY tracked just off the inside in closest aim of the leader,
advanced to take command seven-sixteenths from home, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, yielded the front
and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
BIG MOUNTAIN forwardly placed from off the rail from the get-go, sparred for the top from path two travelling on the turn, took control as three-quarters was
being completed, was given his cue, emerged at the eighth pole leading by its largest margin, squandered much of it, but held sway. DURKIN'S CALL
reserved towards the three path for nearly three-quarters, angled five wide into the lane, had a good finish down the center of the strip to garner the place.
HEAVY ROLLER took the inside route until the end of the bend, swung out three wide entering the stretch, rallied for the show. DIRECT ORDER loped
along taking up the chase from path two, got sent out into path six from upper to midlane, finished well, however belatedly. FLOWERS FOR LISA underwent
a two wide pursuit, went into the stretch, made no headway. AIR ATTACK off the rail, kept within striking distance of the front runners three wide, put in its
bid spinning into the lane, gave way. RUNABOUT sighted about three wide on the turn, came under a drive by the five-sixteenths pole, stepped into the
stretch and failed to fire appreciably. HAMMERIN AAMER saved ground until the quarter pole, was spotted into three path for the stretch run, had no rally.
SKYLER'S SCRAMJET disputed the pace from along the inside and faltered. KAMPAI set up the two path on the backstretch, was through by the half mile
pole.

Footnotes
ON THE COUCH chased just off the inside from mid pack, tucked inside through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch roused for the drive, tipped out to
the three path a furlong from home, and rallied to engage the top pair inside the final sixteenth taking over command in the last jumps to the wire to prevail.
DANFUSI three wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader, got set down continuing three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge
through the final furlong taking command near the sixteenth marker, dug in between foes late and was caught in the final strides. ROCKIN JO lightly coaxed
showing the way just off the inside, got let out spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and was collared nearing the sixteenth pole, fought
on inside the top pair to the finish to preserve the show honors. THREE OUTLAWS three then two wide in pursuit, got set down angled four wide into upper
stretch, ran on to miss for the show honors. RIVER KNIGHT chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper
stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish and was outkicked. JIMMY JAZZ hustled from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, went three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. NO MORE MIRACLES broke out at the start and was corrected,
chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
improved position. GLENN LIKES GIN five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made some headway to the finish. IMPAZIBLE ODDS chased three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and offered no response. TIERGAN chased four wide coaxed along from the five-sixteenths,
angled seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. OUR DESTINY four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide
into upper stretch and weakened. WILD WILLIAM got backed out prior to the start and reloaded, had the latch sprung immediately and tossed his head
unprepared for the start as the assistant starter barely got settled in, got away in a tangle conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased five wide coming
under coaxing just past the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened.

LOVE ME TOMORROW secured a prominent position after making solid contact with QUEENTIGUA at the start, prompted the pace towards the three path
during the run around the bend, crept up the half was being completed, challenged in earnest stepping onto the top of the lane, forged to the front end
during the run through the furlong grounds, extended the margin, kept to the task at hand. GRAPE THERAPY along the outside, was parked out four wide
on the turn, was as wide entering the stretch, rallied well enough to procure the place. WOMEN NOT EASY established the top well before arriving at the
conclusion of the backstretch, showed the way from the two path, shadowed by the winner from the outside, saw that opponent increase her presence as
the second fraction was being finalized, got set down, yielded a short distance from the eighth pole, weakened into the show slot. MIZZYS IMAGE put to
some encouragement after springing from the gate, pursued the front runners while taking the inside route, hand urged on the turn, cut the corner into the
stretch, lacked the necessary response. QUEENTIGUA made contact with the top one after coming out with her initial step, got sent over to the rail at the
half mile pole, rode it into the stretch, was gradually worked to the five path during the ensuing furlong, made no impact. REMOANE tracked the front
runners from the rail on the turn, came under a ride tipping out into the two path for entrance into the stretch, failed to fire. EXCITED FEELING chased the
pace from the three path on the turn, angled out six wide for the stretch run, launched no bids. ARRIETTY hustled from the gate, settled for position in
midpack, travelled two wide on the turn, swung out into path four heading onto the top of the lane, had no rally.
