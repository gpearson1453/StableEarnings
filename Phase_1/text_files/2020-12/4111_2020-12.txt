late for the place. WORLD PARTY pressed the early pace from the inside, remained forward but could not keep pace. MOPSICLE chased the early pace
from the outside, steadily advanced through the second turn but came up empty in the drive. RUNAWAY HENNY was no factor. FANCY GI GI was no

Footnotes
BREW CASA chased the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded when sat down for the drive and was along in time.
AMARDINE broke sharp from the outside, gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the second turn,
remained forward but could not match strides. MY HALF stalked the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced through the second turn, altered outside
and was just up for the show. WEAVEMEAWINR forced the early pace outside but had nothing for the drive. SALUTE ELLE pressed the early pace and
tired. COOL DEAL was no factor. IMAJIMMYCREED chased the early pace and faded. RUNNING ROSADO was never close.

chased the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced through the turn, altered outside for the drive, responded and rallied late for the show. AZTEC
DELITE forced the early pace outside but could not keep pace. HOLT COUNTY broke in a tangle at the start and finished belatedly. TOP CAT BOOGIE was
no factor. D'TUFF CAT REY forced the early pace inside and tired. CARSON CITY CAT was never close.

SILVER SIREN outrun early, inched forward up the backstretch, circled rivals on the second turn, responded when sat down for the drive and closed with a
rush to be in time. THIS IS MY PRAYER stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, responded entering the drive but
was no match for the winner while clearly second best. ITSNOTMYJOB well placed from the inside, chased the early pace up the backstretch, held a
forward position for the drive but could only hold the show. SHESTHECATSMEOW dueled from the inside early, battled up the backstretch, gained a clear
margin at the eighth pole but could not last. OLIVIA'S DUCHESS could only improve position. GEORGIA DAWN was no factor. CALAJA forced the early
pace and tired. TEMPLE OF ROSES was no threat. JOE G'S PAYBACK dueled from the outside and gave way.
