HUSH OF A STORM perfect spot to the half, swift move outside past the quarter pole to lead and ran away in the stretch run as much the best.
HOMETOWN HERO unhurried early, moved up steadily for the place spot while no match for the winner. COASTAL WATERS contended to deep stretch
but raced along for the show spot in the stretch run while no match for the top pair. FIVE DREAMS raced evenly with no response when called upon.
SABUDA chased pace from inside to the half, weakened from the turn. ALPHA PREDATOR never close to far turn, improved position in the stretch run.
CALL PAPA never factored. SHARTLE failed to menace. TEMPO RUBATO had anawkward start, checked sharply into the first turn with lno chance
thereafter. ROOKIE YEAR through after half and dropped far back. MASTER OF WAR never a real menace throughout. PATRIARCH ARTIE good speed to
the front for a half and gave way and dropped far back. NO HEAD ON VIDEO PROVIDED TO EQUIBASE

ENGLISH TIDE just off leaders to turn, split horses past quarter pole, angled in and rallied to stride clear in the late going. MACHO MADNESS chased to
half, dueled to the stretch but could not handle the winner late. STRIKE NOW threw head and reared at the break, no speed to the turn, rallied along for
show spot and returned bleeding from the nostrils. SONIC BURN unhurried to the turn, closed late ground in the stretch. OAK ROOM raced evenly with no
response when needed. SIR NUISANCE never a real factor. KOBE BEACH had a terrble start with no late kick in the stretch run. CUP GAME passed some
tired ones. SARDONIC SMILE pace to the half, gave way readily. DETECTIVE never close. FILIMONS QUEST tried to stay with leaders to half, gave way
willingly. RIVER STONES always trailed. HEAD ON VIDEO NO PROVIDED TO EQUIBASE
