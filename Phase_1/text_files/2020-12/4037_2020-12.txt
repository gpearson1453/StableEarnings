DON'T MAKE IT EASY was between rivals early and then was left with the rail, fought back after losing the lead with a furlong to run and won going away.
IRONBOUND was lapped on winner, took the lead briefly in mid stretch but was unable to match strides late. WINNING DRIVE saved ground, came out a
bit on the far turn, drifted out in early stretch and fought well to regain the show spot. TRUE WISDOM raced outside, came in slightly on the far turn,
continued wide and faded late. RUNS FOR LUCK saved ground and failed to be a serious threat. ASK CHUCK, between foes, steadied back on the far turn,
moved out near stretch and gave way. THOMAS KNIGHT failed to be a serious threat. BLINDING raced wide and failed to menace. JACKS A WARRIOR
was off the rail and between foes, failed to menace. CLAIMS OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF ASK CHUCK AGAINST BOTH WINNING DRIVE AND TRUE
WISDOM FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE THREE EIGHTHS POLE WERE BOTH DISMISSED.

Footnotes
MANAGING RISK broke slowly, moved up between foes, swung six wide into stretch and finished with a rush to be along in time. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD
broke alertly after yet another long gate load, joined for command outside, was clear mid stretch then just failed. HAPPYASCANB saved ground to stretch,
moved out and split foes but failed to sustain his bid. INDIRECTLY broke slowly, saved ground to the turn, angled out and then had no late kick. ALWAYS
FREE, between foes, moved out for the drive and couldn't gain. REFI raced very wide and passed tiring foes. CITY GUY, between rivals early, moved out
very wide and tired. MOUNTAIN TREE failed to menace. TRAFFIC TROUBLE was very wide and had only brief speed. LAWYER ROY, just off the pace
and just off the rail, tired. RULES was trying to bear out on the backstretch while dueling, remained a factor to near stretch then gave way. NO FLY ZONE,
between rivals early, swung wide and tired.
