ADVOCATING unhurried early, angled four wide into the stretch, responded well and cleared under stout handling. REARRANGE settled back to the turn,
angled in through stretch for the place spot while no match for the winner. KARAKONTIE FLYER sprinted clear outside to the stretch, led to the furlong pole
but proved no match for the top pair. SISTER'S GHOST in tight on rail and steadied back to turn, re-rallied in the stretch run. M IS FOR MAGIC bobbled at
the break, rushed between horses to turn, weakened. TAPS no speed to stretch, altered course twice, improved position. YES I'M LOOKING good position
from the rail throughout with no late response in the drive. EGALITE saved ground to deep stretch with nothing to offer thereafter. ANOTHER RACHEL good
position between horses to turn, gave way readily. THIS JUST IN well off rail trip throughout and never a menace. HEAD ON VIDEO NOT PROVIDED TO
