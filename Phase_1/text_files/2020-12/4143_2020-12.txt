Footnotes
DUST EM tracked in range along the outside through early stages, launched a four wide bid on the turn, continued to gather momentum entering stretch
run, steadily inched up closer along the outside and got up deep stretch. RIVER RULER vied for the early lead racing inside of SIDETOWN, continued to
match strides with rival around the turn, briefly shook away to a slim lead upper stretch, battled back gamely when the winner came on in the final sixteenth
then lacked a final kick in reserve to prevail. LUCKY PROMISE was well placed while settled behind the top pair through early stages, picked up the pace
three wide on the turn, roused forward to challenge for the lead near the furlong grounds then failed to sustain kick and flattened in final stages. STONE
CAFE was allowed to settle along the outside through the backstretch, hustled along five wide into the drive and lacked a needed rally. WACO KID was
unhurried in the back of the pack, roused two wide into stretch but never reached serious contention. BIZZY LEGS raced in range through early stages then
had no response when called upon on the turn and gave way in the lane. SIDETOWN vied for the early lead racing outside of RIVER RULER, continued to
match strides around the turn then came up tired upper stretch.

Footnotes
KIRK OF DIAMONDS was allowed to settle out of the gate then rated in range of the leaders down the backstretch, advanced while poised to strike three
wide with three furlongs left to run, took a slim lead then continued on top into stretch run and held clear under a driving finish. GOSPEL CARLO was
unhurried and raced well off the early pace, hustled up three wide entering top stretch, gathered momentum under steady pressure then shifted in to split
foes with a sixteenth left to run and produced a solid finish. GRAND ROYALE settled while rated through early stages, picked up the pace along the outside
around the final turn, roused four to five wide to race in striking distance in the final furlong but lacked the needed surge to move by. BIG GAME HUNTER
brushed with rival at the start then was unhurried, hustled along five wide upper stretch and gained position in the lane. STICKINWITHTHEGUYS led the
way into the backstretch, set a pressured pace then matched strides entering the far turn, got collared by the winner nearing the quarter pole then gave way
in the lane. LORD STRATTON bobbled at the start then stalked near the inside, roused along the rail into the stretch, raced in contention with a furlong left
to run then evened out. TOUCH 'EM UP bumped with rival at the start, lagged in the back then was ridden along entering top stretch and failed to pose a
threat. SEATTLE THUNDER pressed the pace through the backstretch, vied for the lead entering the far turn then tired in the lane. SLEWA RED was not to
far back early on then had no response when called upon and dropped back.

CAUSEWAY JONES was away alertly, quickly cleared on top and angled to the inside, continued with the clear advantage into stretch run, widened under
pressure then finished in hand while clearly best. JUNESANDRA chased in range and hustled along three wide near the quarter pole, stayed on with
response through the lane but was no match for the sharp winner. RUN FAST raced behind the leader and continued to chase after the winner near the
inside into stretch run and collared for place in the final sixteenth. SR. BI BI saved ground while hustled along the rail around the turn then failed to threaten
in the lane. BROTHER ROBERT raced widest into stretch run and lacked a needed rally. BEAUREGARD swerved in, bumped with foe and steadied at the
start, raced in range while moving out wider around the turn then gave way. CLASSY MELODY chased along the outside near mid-range in early stages
then had no response entering the lane. HUNKY DUNN hustled along the inside around the turn then lacked response in the lane. FITTS got bumped back
and steadied at the start then failed to move into contention. EASY SAM bumped with foe at the start, raced wide, lost contact with the field and eased up.

HEADLAND grabbled a slim lead out of the gate and set a pressured pace through early stages, continued to hold a narrow advantage over MT. BRAVE
around the turn, given cue entering top stretch, responded willingly and pulled away. MT. BRAVE applied pace pressure to HEADLAND down the
backstretch, sat poised to strike and lodged a bid for command leaving the turn, was no match for going away winner but stayed on with response for
second best. GIRLS A BULLET raced between rivals in the second flight leaving the backstretch, hustled along three wide entering upper stretch then took
the inside position and finished evenly for a share. YAK ATTACK bobbled at the start then raced in range along the outside, given cue to pick up the pace
nearing the quarter pole, hustled along four to five wide entering top stretch then failed to move on. STORMIEIS BLUE raced in range of the top pair down
the backstretch, continued in contention along the inside around then turn then gave way in the lane.

place. GAME LOADING raced up close tracking the early pace, launched a bid and vied three deep around the turn, could not move on for the lead near the
furlong grounds but stayed on for a share. GRAB THE MUNNY led the way in opening stages then came under attack for the lead leaving the backstretch,

foes at the quarter pole, continued without a clear path upper stretch and remained in traffic past the furlong marker, tipped out and got clear late, kicked in

quarter pole, tipped out a path and hustled up two wide near mid-stretch, dug in gamely, forged to the lead and held firm. POLLY TIZ vied for the lead racing
outside of SPECIAL TREASURE, continued to match strides around the far turn, stayed on gamely and dug in past the furlong marker then lacked a late
needed kick to hold off the winner. SHE'S ALL WOLFE raced near midpack down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the far turn, remained a
sharp contender three wide with a furlong left to run then failed to be a late match for the winner and got edged out for place. TIZTHEBOSS tracked the
pace down the backstretch, hustled up three to four wide on the far turn then continued a steady even effort through the lane. THE ONE FOR FUN settled
off the early pace, came under a ride around the far turn and lacked a needed rally in the lane. SPECIAL TREASURE vied for the lead along the inside of
POLLY TIZ, battled back into upper stretch the came up tired. JESSIE'S VALENTINE was unhurried and raced in the back, was put to a drive entering top

Footnotes
HUNKA BURNING LOVE broke on top and led the way around the first turn and continued to set the pace down the backstretch, repelled bids around the
far turn then responded willingly when roused for more and finished going away. SUMMER REVOLUTION settled through early stages then hustled up
leaving the far turn, hustled along four to five wide upper stretch and finished with response for second best. FAST BREAKIN CASH lagged behind in the
back then raced wide entering the lane, showed late response and improved position. PLAINSMAN stalked through the backstretch, given cue three wide
mid-way ion the far turn, remained in contention upper stretch then gave way. BOX SEAT raced off the early pace, hustled up on the far turn, raced six wide
top of the lane then failed to kick on. ROTATION raced off the pace, saved ground on the final turn and lacked a needed rally. POPULARITY stalked
through early stages, launched a two wide bid entering the far turn then gave way. VANGILDER raced off the pace then turned for home three wide and
lacked a needed rally. DRIFTING WEST raced in range, hustled along the fat turn then failed to sustain bid upper stretch.
