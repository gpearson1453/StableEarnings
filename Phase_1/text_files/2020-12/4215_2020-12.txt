Footnotes
CUSTOM BOBBY'S angled in quickly while going to the front and bothered foes badly to his inside, set the clear pace, went around the turn in the two path,
was headed in upper stretch, fought on well under a left-handed whip, regained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and narrowly prevailed under
strong handling. READY FOR LOVE tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole, took a short lead
while still on his inside lead in upper stretch, battled outside of the winner into the final furlong, lost the lead back to that foe outside the sixteenth-pole,
fought to the wire and just missed while able to get the place. MARTINIZED broke out and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, settled towards the
rear, rounded the turn in the two path, was put to a drive in upper stretch, gained into the final sixteenth, moved out late and finished with good energy to
just get the show. SARAH'S VISION bumped with RANCH BADGE while put in tight by CUSTOM BOBBY'S early then checked, settled in the middle of the
field, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then moved out while placed under a drive, gained into the final sixteenth and finished
willingly to just miss the show. STONECATCHER was off very slow and spotted the front many lengths, settled towards the back, went three wide on the
turn, spun four wide into the stretch then moved out further around the three-sixteenths and failed to rally. RANCH BADGE broke a step slow, bumped with
SARAH'S VISION while they were both put in tight by the winner early then steadied, angled to the outside, went four wide while asked on the turn, was
pulled in by the rider in order to get him to switch leads just after turning into the stretch, stumbled trying to complete that process and capitulated. APACHE
TEARS broke very slow and spotted the front many lengths, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. (Rail at 7 Feet)

Footnotes
CHELSEA BRIDGE was sent hard from the start, moved up to take the lead then set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail while inside
of a foe on the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and proved much the best under strong urging. SINGING N' PRAYING was bumped at the start then
bumped solidly with foes on both sides shortly thereafter, settled off the pace, was roused while three then two wide on the turn, moved into second position
outside the eighth-pole, drifted out into the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. LIBERATED STRIFE was ridden along on the far outside, went
five wide on the turn, came under the whip in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. CUSTOM FOR ALY broke in and bumped with a rival at the
start, bumped again with that foe shortly thereafter, was forwardly placed on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, drifted in briefly behind the
leading duo around the three-eighths, moved out after turning into the stretch and came up empty. DEBS PRAYER was away alertly, showed speed then
chased the pace, dropped back under urging while inside on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch and failed to respond. FUHR MEO bumped with a
rival after the start while hustled, pressed the winner on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. JULIA'S
CHANCE broke very slow and spotted the front many lengths, raced inside to the two path on the turn and was no factor.

and was outfinished while just able to get the place. APPLE DAPPLE was off about two lengths slow, rounded the first turn in the two path, was unhurried at
the rear, saved ground early on the far turn, angled three then four wide late on that bend then swung seven wide into the stretch, bumped with a foe while

pace on the inside, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the lead in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and gave way. CUBS WIN went around

Footnotes
KLAYTON'S KANDY bumped with a rival at the start, was hustled to the lead and set the pace, controlled the action while inside on the turn, responded well
when set down in upper stretch and held under strong urging. RUMPUS chased the pace, went three then two wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a
drive in the stretch and was out-kicked while clear for the place. SPARKLE OF HOPE settled at the rear of the field, rounded the turn in the two path, was
roused while swinging five wide into the stretch, moved further out around the three-sixteenths and finished willingly to just get the show. SOLAR
REFLECTION broke out at the start, settled on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went four to five wide on the turn, came seven wide into
the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the show. UNWANTED INPUT settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch
and lacked the needed response. BELL DAY bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, dropped back in the two path
into the stretch and came up empty. AUNT JOIE tracked the pace on the outside, was taken up briefly while lugging out a bit five wide into the turn then
dropped to four wide, came six wide into the stretch and capitulated. (Rail at 7 Feet)

Footnotes
FULL AUTHORITY was well placed just off the pace, drafted behind the leaders while two to three wide on the turn, was roused with clear room at the
quarter-pole, gained into the final furlong, rallied to the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear late under strong handling. VERB pressed the pace
on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, took the advantage outside the five-sixteenths, dropped closer to the two path nearing the quarter-pole,
was asked for his best in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while able to get the place. LAFITTE'S FLEET
settled just off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and finished willingly for
the show. SIR TRUEBADOUR tracked the pace down the backstretch, made a bid in the four path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, dropped
back into the final furlong and weakened. MISTER K was bumped at the start then forced hard into his stablemate, settled at the rear of the field, went
around the turn in the two path, moved out inside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. COLTONATOR was ridden along on the far outside, went six
then seven wide on the turn and failed to rally. GROVE DADDY bumped soundly with his stablemate at the start, settled at the rear, went around the turn in
the three path, angled out significantly in upper stretch then drifted out outside the furlong marker and was no factor. DESTINY WAY was forwardly placed
on the outside, made a bid in the five path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. NICE WORK broke in and bumped
with a foe, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead outside the five-sixteenths and tired. CHUBLICIOUS

Footnotes
OUTAMINE raced just off the pace on the outside, was asked while four to five wide on the turn, chased six wide into the stretch, made an outside bid into
the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. GEM OF CARLOS bumped with a rival at the start, raced just off the pace, dropped back leaving the
backstretch, saved ground on the turn, gained under a drive into the final furlong and finished with good courage to narrowly get the place. TOO MUCH
BOURBON settled towards the back, went three to four wide on the turn, swung six wide from behind horses into the stretch and finished with good energy
to just miss the place while able to get the show. KING'S PRAYER bumped with a foe at the start, showed good speed on the outside then moved clear
near the half-mile pole, raced inside to the two path on the turn, was asked once straightened for the drive then was put to the whip, led into the final furlong
but was overtaken then lost the show. AMAZING AMERICAN was away alertly, showed speed then tracked the pace, went two then three wide on the turn,
was asked a bit in upper stretch then roused for more inside the three-sixteenths, made a bid into the final furlong but was out-kicked. LIONS HOT MESS
broke a bit slow and spotted the front a few lengths, was ridden along while well behind, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path
and failed to threaten. IDE B A WINNER broke a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went two to three wide on the turn, was driven into upper
stretch and failed to respond. CHASING A SAINT showed speed then tracked the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, floated five wide into the
stretch and retreated.
