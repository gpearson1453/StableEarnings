MISS PACO LEMON stalked the pace early, took over command, was off the rail into the lane then drew off late in the stretch under a steady drive.
OSPREY COURT dwelt at the start, trailed early on, made a middle move along the backstretch, began a rally along the far turn, was in the five path into
the lane, made a bid in the stretch, was no match for the winner but was easily second best. PRADO AMORE hit the gate at the start, chased the pace
early, was in the three path into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the stretch run. SMILING GRACE set the pace early, was on the inside
into the lane and faded down the lane. TOUCH OF BLESSING raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive.
SWEET SAMURAI stalked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and was empty down the lane. IMNOTSMALL was through after a half.
JILLIANA was never a factor. LADY ELSA was done early. OHIO TIME was a bit slow at the start and through early on. ABBY'S LUCKY HEART had early
speed then folded up. HEAD ON VIDEO NOT PROVIDED TO EQUIBASE.

bid nearing the lane, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch. FRONT MAN raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane
while making a bid but faded late in the stretch. CRIMINAL DEFENSE was never a threat. CONTINENTAL CLASH set the pace with a very long lead then
