Footnotes
SPEND BENJAMINS stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out nearing the lane, took the lead between rivals turning for home an drove clear. KASIM was
bumped at the start, advanced three and four wide around the turn, reached near even terms entering the lane but was one-paced through the stretch.
MIDNIGHT TEQUILA raced off the early pace, advanced four wide around the turn, came widest into the lane and rallied outside. LORD OF WAR hesitated
at the start, raced well back inside, tipped two wide nearing the lane, raced greenly while trying to lug in through the lane and finished with interest. WORK
ETHIC stalked the pace two and three wide and faded. BERHANU broke outwardly and bumped KASIM at the start, saved ground and never threatened.
UNDER THE COUVERS set the pace along the rail, was collared turning for home and tired inside. PARMENIDES was outrun while racing two wide.
QUICK INDY dwelt and was never close. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND RULED THAT QUICK INDY CAUSED HIS
OWN TROUBLE. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
FLAMING HOT set a pressured early pace hounded by several pursuers, gave them the slip around the turn, and was driving to keep YES FOR LESS at
bay late. YES FOR LESS raced four to five wide around the turn, finished well outside and was clearly second best. COMPANY STORE was forwardly
placed inside for a half-mile, and lacked a closing response. PRICEY VICTORY raced four wide, and faded in the stretch. GROOVY LEMON PIE bumped
with CAPTAIN DUKE at the start, pressed the pace between horses two wide, and gave way through the lane. BLACK HOPE was no factor two wide.
CAPTAIN DUKE bumped with GROOVY LEMON PIE at the start, chased three wide early, and was finished after a half-mile. STARSHIP TAXI lost ground
to the leaders two then three wide around the turn, and faded away into the stretch. EXTREMELYEXCLUSIVE lacked room after the start, and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
AZIZA brushed with TAKE CHARGE RO at the start, settled in range two wide, angled three wide turning for home, drifted out under left-handed urging,
rallied down the center of the course, straightened out under right-handed pressure near the sixteenth pole, switched leads back and forth while gaining and
was up in the final strides. TAKE CHARGE RO brushed with the winner at the start, pressed the pace two wide, seized command near the quarter pole,
drifted out near the sixteenth pole and led until the final strides. BLACK MAGIC WOMAN saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn and
rallied for the show. L'INDISCRET veered in at the start, raced off the pace two wide, angled further out in upper stretch and had a mild gain. STEAL THE
STARS was rank early, appeared to lose a shoe nearing the first turn, set the pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. SUMMER RETURNS stumbled
at the start, tracked the pace from the rail and lacked a bid. LIPSLIKECHERRIES (GB) was outrun inside.

Footnotes
AWESOME ANNMARIE was a step slow to begin, shifted out five wide near the back coming off the turn, rallied determinedly on the far outside and got
past FLORADO in the last 50 yards. FLORADO outbroke the field but let BEND THE KNEE go on with it after the start, took over readily outside that one
and opened up coming to the quarter-pole, stayed clear to 70 yards out but could not withstand the winner. MADAME ROUGE had aim outside the leader
three wide into the stretch, stayed on her left lead and flattened out with a furlong remaining. TOASTNJAM bobbled slightly at the start, moved off the inside
around the turn, and could not gain. KAY'S DREAM lunged awkwardly at the start, moved inside around the turn, and never reached contention. BEND THE
KNEE went up to get the lead shortly after the start, got collared by FLORADO coming to the five-sixteenths, and retreated.

Footnotes
CAJUN EMBERS tucked in behind the leaders at the rail for seven furlongs, tipped two wide in upper stretch, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and
edged ahead under a drive. RELIABILITY was shuffled back soon after the start, raced well back three wide early, advanced four wide around the far turn
and finished willingly outside. VINTAGE KITTEN saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. ALASTOR set the pace
along the rail and yielded near the sixteenth marker. SIR HOSKI trailed inside for a half, went five wide around the far turn and improved position. NEW
YORK STYLE failed to menace while racing two wide early and four wide around the far turn. STRONG HEADED raced in range three wide and lacked a
closing bid. RED SORRELL played no factor while racing two wide. NINJA DUST prompted the pace two wide and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
MY BOY BLUE tracked outside BLOKE early, took over from outside under his own power midway on the far turn, and stayed clear under pressure through
the stretch. SEIZE THE HAY broke a couple lengths slow, advanced three wide after six furlongs, could not reach the winner but ran on best of the others.
BIG PERM bumped with TEACHABLE MOMENT at the start, saved ground to the far turn, moved out into the lane and rallied to go clear for the show. MR.
MAZZA hit the left side of the gate at the start, lagged well back for six furlongs, and improved past tired rivals for the last major share. SULEMAN bumped
solidly with NOTHINBUTABLUR at the start, raced four to five wide and well back to the stretch, and improved without threatening. TEACHABLE MOMENT
was bumped lightly between horses at the start, stayed in range to the stretch, and came up empty. PERFECT ENOUGH was no factor two then three wide
on the turns. BEYOND THE CALL bumped lightly with TEACHABLE MOMENT at the start, raced two wide on the turns, and tired. JEALOUS EYES went
along in range three wide early, and gave way before completing six furlongs. BLOKE set the pace inside, yielded to MY BOY BLUE on the far turn, and
retreated. NOTHINBUTABLUR bumped solidly with SULEMAN at the start, advanced four wide after six furlongs, but could not sustain the rally.

COMPETITIVE SPEED raced off the early pace outside, made good progress four wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, rallied
outside, took a short lead leaving the eighth pole, finally switched to the right lead nearing the sixteenth pole and quickly drew off under a drive. PINK FIZZ
set the pace in the two path, drew clear around the turn, led to midstretch and was no match for the winner in the final furlong. ROYAL HABIBI stalked the
pace three wide, bid nearing the lane and came up empty in the drive. SASSY BEAST had some early speed, retreated two wide around the turn, was
pulled up short, unsaddled on the turn and walked off. PANDORICA was outrun inside. GLITTER BAY had brief speed inside.

CHOATE BRIDGE saved ground covered up for six furlongs, moved out leaving the far turn, kicked in through the furlong grounds and overhauled BEAN
COUNTER from outside to win going away. CENTSLESS DRAMA broke to the lead, rated along clear inside to deep stretch, could not contain the winner
but held well for second. PARDON MY HEART was bumped between horses at the start, went along in the second flight for six furlongs inside, stayed on
the rail for the drive, and did not have enough. BEAN COUNTER saved ground on the turns, moved out to the three-path in upper stretch and was
outfinished. KELLEYCANRUN bumped with PARDON MY HEART at the start, raced inside to the far turn, came two wide into the stretch, and was in traffic
the last eighth of a mile. BARONESS VONTRAPPE prompted the pace outside CENTSLESS DRAMA for six furlongs, and faded in the stretch. GOOD LIFE
CIDER steadied on the first turn three wide, and tired after six furlongs. AMADORA broke in causing crowding, was steadied along unsettled into and
around the first turn, swung four wide nearing the stretch and could not gain. LADY PANDA was four wide into the first turn, and never reached contention.
SEA OF BLUE stayed in range for six furlongs three wide, and tired. ALL COME TRUE (FR) broke two lengths slow, was keyed up at the back going to the
first turn, moved out four wide on the far turn, and was empty. DYNATOWN got pushed into PARDON MY HEART by AMADORA at the break, and was
outrun three wide.

SOLDOLLIE dueled at the rail throughout and prevailed. KILLA DEE dueled three wide early then had a short lead outside of the winner for most of the final
three-eighths pole and just missed in a game try. KAREN'S COVE settled off the pace near the inside, angled out in upper stretch and rallied. STARSHIP
APOLLO raced four wide in midpack, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied late. DR HARLAN was not a threat while racing four and five wide.
YOUNG RAYMOND saved ground off the pace, angled out near the quarter pole and lacked a rally. BLACK PEPPER played no factor while racing five
wide. STEEL SHOT hit the starting gate, raced two wide and made little impact. NORTHERN dueled between the top two finishers for three furlongs then
retreated. STONE HANDS chased the pace two wide and came up empty. ESPRESSO CALIENTE trailed inside.

Footnotes
RULE YOURSELF saved ground to the far turn, waited behind horses past the quarter-pole while shifting out three wide, found a seam between horses
once straightened away at the head of the stretch, and kicked in to run past the battling leaders from outside in the closing yards. HONOLULU EXPRESS
vied inside rivals from the outset, dug in after being headed a quarter-mile out, and stayed on stubbornly. HERO TIGER lacked room after the start, raced
four wide throughout, bid outside the leaders with a run on the far turn, fought on gamely but was edged late. DEVOTED KITTEN was four then three wide
moving up after the opening quarter-mile, contested the pace outside HONOLULU EXPRESS and BATTLE OF BLENHEIM around the far turn and into the
lane, and was outfinished. PONT DU GARD raced two to three wide in range for six furlongs, had aim outside the front flight through mid stretch but did not
have enough. CASH CALL KITTEN bumped with JUST THE FACTS at the start, saved ground close up to the stretch, and was stymied in traffic through the
final furlong. BATTLE OF BLENHEIM vied two wide between horses to the stretch, and gave way past the eighth-pole. SURF SHACK raced two to three
wide on the turns, and posed no threat. TOUPHA raced three wide early, moved out to the four-path on the far turn, and could not gain. JUST THE FACTS
bumped with CASH CALL KITTEN at the start, stayed close two wide to the far turn, and had no rally. FIRST AND THREE was outrun inside.
