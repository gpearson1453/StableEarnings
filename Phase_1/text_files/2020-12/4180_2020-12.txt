CREATIVE STORY was never far back two wide, lacked room between and behind horses around the final turn, surged late and was in time. HOUSE
ARREST was sent clear soon after the break, regained a short lead leaving the furlong grounds but couldn't withstand the winner. MICKEY T pressed two
wide, moved to a short lead nearing the stretch then weakened in the drive. LE GROS BILL wasn't far back three wide, loomed a threat into the final furlong
and hung. LUCKY LOVER BOY raced in good position along the rail to the stretch then weakened. THE GREAT CASBY was caught in tight along the rail
into the first turn, swung out entering the stretch and gained mildly. CUTTER HELM raced three wide and tired. MCLEAN HOUSE was outrun. RANDOM
THOUGHTS was caught wide around the first turn then stopped. APPRAISED was outrun.

courage once displaced. DIGGERS DIAMOND was slow early, stayed inside and improved position through the lane. DOUBLE CHUBBLE raced the three
