Footnotes
NO CENTS , two wide on the turn, swung out turning for home, gained a short lead approaching the eighth pole then lugged in near the sixteenth pole.
KENNY HAD A NOTION saved ground on the turn, hugged the inner rail in the stretch and finished gamely to just miss. SINGLINO prompted the pace two
wide, challenged for the lead on the turn, remained prominent in the stretch and was steadied when put in tight quarters by NO CENTS near the sixteenths
pole. THE WOLFMAN bore in when breaking awkwardly, was lightly steadied along the inner rail leaving the backstretch then raced evenly. TIZ MANDATE ,
along the inner rail on the turn, failed to menace. BOSS LOGIC was not a factor. An objection by the rider of SINGLINO against NO CENTS for interference
in the stretch was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch run but no action was taken.

Footnotes
STREET LUTE broke sharp and dropped in to set a rated pace, handled outside pressure mid turn, entered the lane in the two path, opened up after being
roused past the three sixteenths, was mainly hand ridden through the final furlong and got the bob. FRAUDULENT CHARGE saved ground while not far
back, was urged along to maintain position mid turn, moved up to the inside of a rival leaving the eighth pole, altered out for a clear run soon after, closed
strongly and just missed. OUT OF SORTS settled outside a rival, moved up three to four wide into the lane, chased the leaders past the three sixteenths
then flattened out. WHISKEY AND RYE broke awkwardly and to the inside, corrected and edged up outside the winner, pressed that one to the quarter
pole, failed to go on under asking in upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MISS LESLIE stalked the pace under patient handling between horses down the backstretch, was taken to the four path leaving the far turn, closed
determinedly and was up between rivals approaching the finish. BUCKEY'S CHARM , three wide entering the first turn, moved up three deep on the far turn,
gained the lead in upper stretch, drifted out inside the eighth pole, drifted out late and just missed. THE GRASS IS BLUE bumped with ZEYARAAT leaving
the starting gate, trailed for six furlongs, floated to the five path entering the stretch and rallied outside. MALIBU BEAUTY sprinted clear on the first turn,
hugged the inner rail and gave way the final furlong. GUNS BLAZING raced in a striking position along the inner rail on both turns then gave way in the
stretch. TARGE prompted the pace two wide and gave way in the stretch. ZEYARAAT bumped with THE GRASS IS BLUE leaving the starting gate, circled
both turns four deep and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SHACKQUEENKING rated three wide early on while stalking the pace, dropped in a bit and bid outside the leader leaving the far turn, emerged in a duel
past the three eighths while still in hand, came under a ride near the three sixteenths, went nose to nose through the final seventy yards while under right
handed rousing and got up in the final jumps. AIN'T DA BEER COLD was sent clear early then dropped in to set the pace, dug in when collared around the
far turn, dueled under a drive from the five sixteenths to the wire and just missed in a sharp effort. ERAWAN saved ground in range and under some rating,
moved up to have aim on the embattled leaders, churned on willingly through the drive and earned the show. MARKET CAP rated behind foes leaving the
five eighths, steadied briefly past the half mile marker, angled out, circled into the lane, moved up a bit in mid stretch but lacked a serious follow through.
REASSURED , under a snug hold off the early pace, angled out leaving the far turn, circled into the stretch and had belated action. BRETT'S WORLD
stalked two wide between runners, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and retreated. TWITTY CITY broke a step slow, lost ground four wide, was used to
reach contention past the three quarter pole, chased into the far turn then gave way.

Footnotes
DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail while pressed around the turn, asserted herself through the stretch and drew out
while kept to her business. HIBISCUS PUNCH lacked speed, raced two wide on the turn, angled out to the three path in upper stretch and rallied between
horses. MALIBU MISCHIEF prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened the final furlong. CLUB CAR , three deep around the turn, was well
positioned in upper stretch and lacked the necessary late response. NEVER ENOUGH TIME , three wide on the turn, was never a factor. PARISIAN DIVA
hugged the inner rail on the turn and failed to rally. SHYZA raced in the two path on the turn while outrun. SUGGESTIVE HONOR (ARG) , three deep on the
turn, was outrun.

Footnotes
WHERESHETOLDMETOGO rated outside rivals and off of a contested pace, angled out and advanced four wide into the lane, leveled off under left handed
rousing, forged to command a sixteenth out and held firm while kept to task. TACO SUPREAM broke a step slow, recovered and settled off the pace while
saving ground, moved up past the three sixteenths, eased out to work his way between rivals then finished gamely to the inside of the winner. PENGUIN
POWER prompted the pace outside CHARGE TO VICTORY, moved to near even terms into the lane, spurted clear a furlong out then gave way grudgingly.
LAKI , between foes early, was urged along three wide heading towards the lane, steadied lacking room in upper stretch, shifted in and kept trying. LEBDA ,
in the clear and under coaxing tracking the duel, was in a bit close past the three sixteenths then finished evenly. CHARGE TO VICTORY set a pressured
pace inside, lost command past the three sixteenths, fought on to about mid stretch then faded. ONEMOREGREATTIME , three to four wide early, failed to
keep pace past the three furlong pole and faltered. An objection by the rider of LEBDA against TACO SUPREAM for alleged interference in the stretch was
not allowed

Footnotes
HARPERS FIRST RIDE stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the two path on the turn, bid for the lead entering the stretch, battled to mid
stretch then drew off under steady handling. FOREWARNED saved ground on both turns, raced in the two path turning for home and rallied nicely inside
horses. CORDMAKER , three wide down the backstretch, advanced three wide leaving the far turn, challenged the winner in upper stretch, tired in the drive
and drifted out near the sixteenth pole. AIR TOKEN , snugly rated around the first turn, moved up in the two path leaving the far turn and failed to sustain his
bid through the stretch. V. I. P. TICKET , four wide the first turn, raced in the two path on the far turn, swung to the four path with a mild advance entering
the stretch then weakened. SARATOGA JACK set the pace along the inner rail and tired after seven furlongs. HALL PASS , three wide the first turn, was
forwardly placed four deep on the far turn then gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
ERES TU , well in hand three wide stalking the pace, pulled her way forward and bid three deep nearing the far turn, vied outside rivals then was roused
clear into the lane, widened under a drive in mid stretch, remained on her left lead and held sway. WICKED AWESOME rated behind rivals while off the rail,
eased out and picked up steam three to four wide into the lane, straightened away, closed steadily and held down the place. ANOTHER BROAD rated
between rivals near the five eighths, dropped towards the rail leaving the far turn and was put to asking, came back out past the three sixteenths and rallied.
LANDING ZONE eased out early and stalked two wide, bid between foes after a half mile, dueled and gained a slim lead past the three eighths, fought on
into the lane, continued willingly to the furlong grounds then faded. NEEDS SUPERVISION pulled her way clear from the outside, angled in and set a rated
pace, was joined a pair of rivals near the half mile marker, sparred to the quarter pole, remained a presence to mid stretch then gave way. ICE PRINCESS
lost ground four wide stalking the pace, was ridden along past the three eighths but failed to seriously respond. ALITTLELESSTALK stumbled at the break,
dropped off the pace while saving some ground, raced two wide into the stretch but lacked a bid.

Footnotes
SWIRRLIE SHIRLIE sprinted to the early lead, set all the pace and was kept to her business in the drive. PETION LASS lacked speed, circled the turn four
deep and rallied. BLUE SKY VENEZUELA , shuffled back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and rallied inside horses.
GREASEDLIGHTNING lacked speed, swung to the five path entering the stretch and passed tired horses. JOYFUL NOISE saved ground on the turn and
weakened in the drive. OUR STAR chased the pace between horses around the turn then stumbled when apparently clipping heels approaching the eighth
pole. POLISHED GAL chased the pace three wide around the turn and gave way. MAJESTIC PIC was not a factor.
