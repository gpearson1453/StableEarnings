Footnotes
RIDGELYSREDHOT broke readily to race just behind the first flight under light reserve racing to the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn splitting foes
midway through that bend while being urged to challenge for command, moved away to a clear advantage racing into upper stretch and widened under
pressure. HIGHRHYTHMDIXIE, urged to join the pace nearest the rail prompting a rival into the backstretch, edged forward racing into the far turn, briefly
resisted the winner's bid but proved no match in the drive. DEESSE tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, was caught four wide racing
through the far turn while being prompted to advance, lost some ground to the leaders racing into upper stretch but continued with interest outside foes to
narrowly prevail for a share in time. KATIE FALOONA was settled out of striking distance along inside, saved ground throughout but offered no rally.
MERICATHEBEAUTIFUL ducked out at the start while breaking a bit slowly, settled outside a rival and never gained contention. VICE GRIP tracked off the
second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while shifting to the three path in upper stretch but flattened out in late
stages. BOOTSCOOTINSHUFFLE was urged from the break forcing the pace outside a rival to the backstretch, gave way three deep between foes nearing
upper stretch, was outdistanced entering the stretch, then was collected by her rider in the closing stages but walked off the course under her own power.

Footnotes
CONTRAFLOW broke readily, then was urged between foes to gain a narrow advantage racing into the first turn, dictated the pace in the two path into the
backstretch, shook clear leaving the far turn, held sway through the lane under left handed pressure and was taken in hand approaching the wire.
CENTRIFUGE, urged to a contending position three deep between foes racing to the first turn while in touch with the pacesetter, prompted that rival racing
to the far turn but proved no match in the drive while clearly best of the others. MOONSHINE STEVE, pulling against light restraint just inside the pacesetter
racing into the first turn, stalked just off that rival along the rail racing to the far turn but had no closing bid while continuing well enough to edge a rival for a
share late. ON THE LIPS was rated off the first flight between foes from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
while shifting to the four path in upper stretch but had no late bid. MAGICAL CAUSE settled inside foes in the last flight early and offered no rally. PRINCE
PHARAOH, caught four wide racing to the first turn while under some prompting to contend, settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch
and steadily retreated into the lane.

Footnotes
PURCHASING POWER, caught three wide racing to the first turn while being rated off the leaders, angled inwards to track off the leaders outside a rival into
the backstretch, shifted to the three path leaving the far turn while commencing a steady advance, moved to wrest the advantage in that path leaving
midstretch and edged clear in time under left handed pressure and firm hand urging. JACK B WINKLE broke readily to gain a forward placing conceding
some position to the leaders racing into the first turn, shifted out three wide on the first turn stalking just off the leaders into the backstretch, steadily
advanced to press the issue on the far turn, edged forward racing into upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner in the final sixteenth. SILENT MISCHIEF
tracked off the first flight inside the eventual winner racing to the backstretch, shifted out to the three path in the closing stages and edged a rival for a share
while failing to menace the top pair in the drive. SILVER EDGE, urged prompting a rival's pace racing to the first turn, edged forward midway through the
backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival racing into the far turn but emptied out in the last furlong. DUKE OF MONROE, urged inside rivals disputing
the pace from the outset into the backstretch, gave way racing into the far turn. MAYRHOFEN settled between foes in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch but offered no rally. MYSUREWINWILLIAMS settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never
gained contention. DEBDURITE settled inside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and dropped out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
WONDER BLONDY was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch while being
prompted to advance and wrested a clear advantage in time under firm handling. PRINCESS CORA tracked the pacesetter between foes as part of the
second flight while dropping well off that foe racing to the backstretch, shifted to the three path while steadily advancing on the leader nearing upper stretch,
gained a brief advantage midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner. STRICT VOW was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance four wide into the far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to edge rivals for a share. MI
KARLITA angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground into the far turn while dropping out last after six
furlongs, then continued with a solid second effort inside foes to regain position in the closing stages. KELCIE'S MANDATE, shuffled back at the start, was
settled between foes in the last flight racing to the far turn, then shifted out to split foes four wide in the closing stages to gain some position with a belated
effort. MAGDALENA, bumped at the start, switched out to track off the second flight outside foes racing to the far turn, then faded three deep between foes
in the closing stages. SPLENDOR BEACH broke through the gate before the start, tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight racing into
the far turn, then gave way nearing the lane. REAL WILD SOLUTION broke in bumping MAGDALENA at the start, settled between foes in the last flight and
failed to menace. ORNERY ANGEL tracked the pacesetter from out of striking distance inside foes in the second flight racing to the backstretch, saved
ground to upper stretch gaining brief contention but came up empty in the drive. DANGEROUS CURVES was sent clear racing into the first turn, held sway
on a commanding advantage to the far turn and gave out abruptly between foes in upper stretch.

inside that rival in the two path on the backstretch, was prompted to press the issue on the far turn, edged clear in upper stretch and widened the advantage
late under brisk left handed encouragement. THE CURT FOX (GB), unhurried between foes tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted
out four wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance and continued in that path into the lane to prove best of the others. WHISTLE ME
HOME, urged to a forward placing along the inside racing to the first turn, tracked just off the leaders along the inside to the far turn, was urged to advance
along the rail entering the lane and was outkicked for second. SANCOCHO (MEX), urged outside foes to gain terms with the first flight racing to the first
turn, pressed the issue between foes into the second bend and gave way in late stages. LITTLE MAZZY settled last to the backstretch, then passed inside
tiring rivals racing into the stretch. TOTAL TAP tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening half, angled out five wide entering the lane, had no
closing bid and was vanned off the course following the race. SILENT JET shifted out four wide racing to the backstretch to take up a stalking position racing
just off the first flight, was prompted to advance three deep between foes entering the far turn but faded between rivals into the lane. BOOTLEGGER (FR)

Footnotes
FEDERAL CASE broke readily to gain terms with the first flight, attended the pace between foes under light rating racing through the backstretch, pressed
the issue midway through the turn, then edged clear racing a bit off the rail entering the stretch and maintained a safe advantage to the end under firm
encouragement. TONY SMALL angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes racing into the turn, then shifted out three wide in the closing stages
to edge rivals for the place honors. FIRST DEGREE angled sharply to the inside in the opening stages gaining a position just behind the first flight, tracked
the leaders along the inside to the lane and finished evenly late while prevailing for a share. ROCK THE PARK tracked off the first flight four wide between
foes on the backstretch into the turn and continued evenly to late stages. SHAKEM N BREAKEM settled near the inside dropping well off the leaders racing
to the turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch and gained some position between foes while no real threat. SMART WARRIOR switched well to the outside in
the opening stages tracking off the second flight, raced four wide into the bend but lacked a rally. DON H, prominent between foes, angled to the inside in
the opening stages disputing the pace on a narrow advantage inside foes racing into the turn, then gave way between foes leaving midstretch.
SWINGSTAGE, off last, settled between foes and failed to menace. CPL. DIONICIO shifted out five wide tracking off the second flight leaving the chute,
was prompted in brief pursuit of the leaders in that path racing to the turn but emptied out after a half. SUNSHINES OUT settled between foes dropping off
the second flight in the opening quarter and steadily retreated. COGAN dropped out early.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S SPA tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted a bit off the rail nearing the far turn continuing
inside foes, shifted out when losing his path to OBIWAN nearing upper stretch, but continued with a steady effort in the two path racing through the stretch
to bid inside the pacesetter in the closing stages then wrest a narrow advantage in time under firm handling and some right handed pressure. OBIWAN was
held up just off the first flight shifting out three deep racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance,
switched outside the pacesetter entering the lane and continued willingly between foes to challenge for command in the closing stages but couldn't match
the winner while edging a rival for second. JUAN PABLO was rated off the second flight a bit off the inside in the opening half, switched out four wide on the
far turn while being prompted to advance and continued in that path to the end while steadily gaining position to the end. VALIANT VIRTUE, urged to
dispute the pace inside a rival racing just off the rail to the backstretch, shook clear racing into upper stretch but faltered in the final sixteenth. INDIAN BUZZ
was urged to force the pace outside a rival from the outset to the backstretch, couldn't match the leader after six furlongs and gave way between foes into
the stretch. BEE BY THE SEA, caught four wide racing to the backstretch while prompted to a position in the second flight, continued outside foes to the far
turn and faded three deep between rivals nearing the lane. KODIAK BROWN angled inwards to gain a position between foes tracking the leaders in second
flight for five furlongs and steadily faded nearing the lane. SWAGSATIONAL was outpaced along the inside racing to the backstretch and proved no threat.
NEAT STREET worked his way to the inside dropping off the second flight in the opening half and failed to produce a closing response. OUTSTANDING
DEBT, held up avoiding tight quarters at the start, proved no factor.

Footnotes
ALEX'S FIRST was prompted to a forward placing racing just off the leaders in the opening stages, stalked the pace in hand while angling to the inside
entering the bend, was urged to advance along the rail, then was held up avoiding tight quarters nearing upper stretch, altered course to race four wide into
upper stretch but continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under firm handling. KINKY FROLIC joined the pace three deep racing through the
backstretch, shifted inwards pressing the issue between foes on the turn, gained a brief advantage midstretch but couldn't contain the winner late. R
TENDERONI tracked just off the first flight four wide in the opening three furlongs, was prompted to advance on that path on the turn, then continued three
deep between foes into the stretch but had no final kick. BLAZING MISS JOJO, urged to the lead while angling to the inside in the opening stages, dueled
for command racing a bit off the rail through the turn to upper stretch and gave way inside foes late. PRAY FOR RAIN tracked off the second flight between
foes racing to the turn, then angled five wide entering the stretch while lacking a late bid. ONE LUCK GIRL settled between foes in the last flight, angled to
the inside entering the stretch and continued evenly. WILL TAKE ROSES tracked off the first flight three wide between foes racing to the turn and steadily
faded into the lane. PRETTY PRISCILLA settled inside foes in the last flight in the opening half, then angled six wide entering the lane but made no
impression. MAGESTAL BASTIDA switched well off the inside early but failed to menace. MAY BEAU tracked off the second flight racing five wide on the
backstretch and steadily retreated into the turn. D ORO GIRL dropped back early, was soon outdistanced but walked off under her own power.
