Footnotes
MAINTAINANCE MATT bobbled at the start and was off a bit slow, settled on the outside, ranged up three wide on the turn, made a bid outside the
five-sixteenths, took the lead at the quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew away under strong urging. DATA LOAD showed good speed and set
the pace, vied inside on the turn, was challenged outside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into the stretch, chased the winner while still on his inside
lead into the final furlong and proved no match while continuing on his inside lead but was clear for the place. GOFORTHEWINECOURSE tracked the pace
on the outside, chased in the two path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch under the whip and tired while clear for the show. JAIL HOUSE was
well placed just off the pace, came under urging while inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, was driven to the three path late on that bend,
turned into the stretch under the whip and came up empty. PASTOR VAN broke slow then bobbled and bumped with a rival, spotted the front several
lengths, was urged along at the rear, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. THE DEVILS
BACK broke awkwardly and was off about two lengths slow then bumped with a foe, settled on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, floated six
wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BARLEEWON was hustled to the lead, set the pace while well rated inside to the two path, extended the advantage on the far turn, responded well when set
down in upper stretch and maintained a safe advantage under a strong drive. HEALING had his stall door open slightly slower then the rest of the field and
was off a step slow, settled on the inside, came under some encouragement on the far turn, was roused into the stretch then moved out under a drive at the
three-sixteenths and finished with good courage to secure the place. COMEDIAN angled in on the initial straightaway, went around the first turn in the two
path, settled on the inside of a rival, was asked with three furlongs to run, chased in the two path on the far turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and
weakened but was clear for the show. MARSHALL LAW (IRE) was forced out early, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused
while two then three wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and came up empty. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY was rank under restraint
early, went four wide on the first turn, settled outside at the rear on the backstretch, was urged three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and
failed to threaten. STEADYTILLREADY was taken back early then became very rank under restraint, checked nearing the first turn then lugged out into that
bend, settled two to three wide near the back, was roused on the final turn and failed to respond. IMPEACHABLEOFFENSE moved out early, raced in the
four path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside under a tight hold, dropped back under urging while three then four wide on the far turn and
faltered. (Rail at 20 Feet) THREE-QUARTER FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

Footnotes
SIMPLY went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the front on the outside, was asked while three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch
under the whip then was carried further out, chased under a drive into the final furlong, made a bid at the sixteenth-pole, brushed with MAROON MANIAC
near that point, battled with two foes to the wire and narrowly prevailed under good handling. JUSTINTHENICKOTIME went to the front, set the pace in the
two path, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch, fought on very gamely in the final furlong and just missed
while able to get the place. MAROON MANIAC broke out at the start, went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the
three path on the far turn, floated five wide into the stretch then took the lead before the three-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth,
brushed with a foe at that point, fought between horses to the wire and missed but earned the show. CURLINGTON bumped soundly with a foe at the start,
rounded the first turn in the three path, dropped in a path entering the backstretch, settled towards the rear, raced inside early on the far turn, shifted to the
two then three path later on that bend, was roused outside the quarter-pole, swung five wide into the stretch, lugged in some while gaining in the stretch and
finished with good energy to get the last spot in the superfecta. DAY TRIP was well placed just off the pace on the inside, came under urging at the
five-sixteenths, shifted out over heels in upper stretch, pursued the vanguard in the final furlong and was out-kicked. EKATERINOSLAV went two then three
wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace, was asked in the two path on the far turn, dropped back three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. EAST LEX bumped soundly with a rival at the start, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged along while
dropping from the two path to the rail on the far turn and was no factor. MAX PANDOWDY broke out at the start, went five then four wide on the first turn,
settled towards the rear, went three to four wide on the far turn and failed to respond. Following the race, the rider of MAROON MANIAC claimed foul
against SIMPLY alleging interference in late stretch. After the stewards' view, no change was made to the order of finish. (Rail at 20 Feet)

backstretch, was coaxed along in the two path on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, was tossed in by the rider in an attempt to get her to switch
leads while behind horses coming to the three-sixteenths, shifted out from behind those foes shortly thereafter, rallied outside into the final furlong, gained
the lead nearing the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under good handling. CHICK BE QUICK bumped with a rival at the start then came outward, moved in
while going to the front, set the pace on the inside, drifted out under pressure in upper stretch, responded well while leading until near the sixteenth-pole but
was overtaken then finished with good courage to preserve the place. CLOUD TEN was taken under a tight hold early, saved ground on the first turn, settled
off the pace, moved out near the half-mile pole, dropped from three wide to the rail under urging on the far turn and improved position to get the show. SAIL
ON ELLEN was a bit keen under restraint nearing the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, was rated off the pace, came under urging in the two path
early on the far turn, shifted four wide while near the five-sixteenths, floated five wide into the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong and weakened.
CEANT went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid while asked in the two path on the far turn, dropped back under a drive
into the final furlong and tired. TAKE CHARGE PATTI was last to commence as her stall door opened slightly slower the the rest, moved out early, went
three wide on the first turn, settled nicely on the outside, was roused while three then four wide on the far turn, dropped back quickly late on that bend and
failed to respond. BEE HOUSE was taken back at the start, tossed her head while falling well behind, went two to three wide on the turns and trailed. (Rail

Footnotes
SARAH'S PASSION showed good speed and set the pace, vied inside under threat from the runner-up on the turn, responded well while battling that foe
under a drive in the stretch and held under strong urging. STRONG BEAUTY showed speed on the outside then dropped back and tracked the pace,
re-engaged the winner in the three path on the turn, battled outside that foe under a drive in the stretch and was outfinished while clear for the place. PLAY
UNIFIED settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was urged two then three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while able
to get the show. NEW YEAR'S PARTY settled on the far outside, brushed with a foe near the half-mile pole, was urged in the four path on the turn and
lacked the needed kick. KICK N KISS bumped with a rival at the start, angled in early, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path,
angled out around the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. MIA O MAYA tossed her head and reared at the start, was off very slowly, went three wide on
the turn, came five wide into the stretch then drifted further out and was no factor. EZEE ENOUGH bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, settled
under some urging, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn and failed to threaten. TENPINS TEMPO broke awkwardly while bumping with a
foe at the start, was urged along on the inside of a rival, went three then two wide on the turn, chased under a strong drive into upper stretch and came up
empty.

ITS A WRAP bumped with a rival at the start while off a half-step slow, was urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch
in the two path, moved out near the three-sixteenths, angled further out while gaining into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up in the final two
strides. A SONG FOR ARCH was coaxed along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, advanced to make an outside bid
while still on his inside lead into the final furlong, gained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole, led until the final two strides but was denied while able to
get the place. EDEN GREY'S KITTEN moved out while ridden along, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then moved
further out, rallied outside into the final furlong and got up for the show. SPECTROLITE showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe,
continued inside that foe while in the two path on the turn, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, lost the lead outside the sixteenth-pole
and was out-kicked then lost the show. O'L RED disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, battled
under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished. CHANNEL WON was well spotted just off the pace, chased in the three path on the turn, spun four
wide into the stretch, made a bid into the final furlong, battled into the final sixteenth and was also outfinished. RICHARD'S BOY was well placed just off the
pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused while cutting the corner into the stretch, made a rail bid under the whip at the three-sixteenths but was also
out-kicked. LYNCHBURG broke a half-step slow then was hustled, moved up while advancing down the backstretch, raced two path to the inside on the
turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, chased behind a wall of horses into the final sixteenth and lacked the needed kick. MISTER K bumped with a
foe while off a half-step slow, was urged along at the rear, rounded the turn in the two path and was no factor. (Rail at 20 Feet)

outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and was outfinished
while able to get the show. RARE STRAIN bobbled a stride from the start and was off slow, went around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into
the stretch under the whip and gained some but failed to menace. SHACKLE THE GOLD was urged along on the outside, went four then five wide on the
turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. TRUTH TELLER was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, raced inside early
on the turn then moved to the two path and was no factor. RIVERS RISING broke open the front of his stall door prior to the start, disputed the pace on the
inside of a foe, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths and stopped then was eased in the final furlong before being subsuquently vanned off.
