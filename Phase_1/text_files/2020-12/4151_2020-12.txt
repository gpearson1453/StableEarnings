Footnotes
BRAVO BRAVO prompted the pacesetter two wide, took over the lead past the half without being asked, set the pace in the two path on the far turn, opened
up into the lane, and drew off under a mild drive while proving much the best. Z U AT THE RACES raced between horses in the tracking flight through the
clubhouse turn, pulled to join the leading flight three wide approaching the three quarters, settled back to track the leading pair past the three quarters,
continued to track them in the three path through the far turn, went to a drive behind the leader in upper stretch but proved no match, though chased on well
clear of the others. WILDWOODS DREAM settled back two wide in the rear flight, was pushed along three wide into the far turn, improved position under a
drive in the five path around that bend, came five wide into the lane, proved no match for the top two but kept on to outfinish BIT O BODIE for the show. BIT
O BODIE settled at the rear inside of WILDWOODS DREAM, took closer order inside horses past the half mile mark, angled out and rallied in the four path
on the far turn, came into the lane four wide, and was outfinished for the show. MACHO CLASSIC raced at the inside of the tracking flight early, chased the
leading trio into the backstretch, inched inside of Z U AT THE RACES near the five eighths, chased the leading trio in the three path under urging on the far
turn, came into the lane three wide, and offered no kick for the stretch run. IRISH TUFF chased near the rear, was hard to settle into the backstretch, pulled
past TWO COOKIE RULE near the five eighths, was relegated to the rear near the seven sixteenths as others began their rallies, trailed in the two path on
the far turn, came into the lane two wide and lacked the needed rally. TWO COOKIE RULE was keen three wide in the tracking flight through the clubhouse
turn, chased the leading trio outside of IRISH TUFF on the backstretch, was urged in the three path on the far turn but offered no response. KING'S STORY
was keen to the lead inside, set a pressured pace inside of BRAVO BRAVO, could not go with that foe past the half mile mark, saved ground while chasing
the leader through the first part of the bend, and emptied out from the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
YOU'RE IN COREY led the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn, kicked clear
with three eighths of a mile to go and continued to extend his lead down the lane while being kept to the task. WELLFIELD saved ground around the first
turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, began a bid from the rail nearing the three eighths pole and chased the winner
home down the stretch, the best of the rest. DARK WOOD (IRE) bobbled slightly leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the
inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, launched a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground in late stretch while
never threatening the top two. MISTER CHARMING chased the leader from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the
far turn in the two and weakened in the final furlong. NEXT MONDAY raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and came up empty in the stretch. CLOUD TO GROUND raced in the two path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, made a mild bid from the three path near the three eighths pole and flattened out in the stretch.
RECKLESSNESS raced in the four path around the first turn, settled behind the leaders on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began to drop back
while racing in the two path around the far turn and continued to tire from there. SQUIRRELY MIKE raced in the four path around the first turn, tracked the
leaders from the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn, began to drop back from there and continued to fade in the
stretch.

IOWA NATIVE was hustled for speed, set the pace down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, cleared further in upper stretch, and remained
clear while drifting out under right handed urging. RUNNINGFROMTHEFEDS raced at the inside of the tracking flight, saved ground while continuing to
track the leader on the turn, proved no match for the pacesetter into the lane, but kept on with interest to the wire to prove a clear second best. OFFLEE
FUN chased three wide between horses early, raced midpack as the field strung out into the turn, angled in past the three eighths, rallied inside under a
drive into the lane, proved no match for the top pair but kept on best of the rest. YOUNG CORBETT raced between horses in the tracking flight early,
chased in the two path on the turn, came into the lane two wide, proved no match for the top two into the lane, and was outfinished for the show.
TIMINGISEVERYTHING chased between horses on the backstretch, continued in the five path inside of KYZAN on the turn, was driven five wide in upper
stretch, and kept on mildly. TWO PAIR settled in second last, rallied under urging in the two to three path on the turn, tried to sustain his rally but was
stymied in traffic from the three sixteenths past the furlong mark, and was outfinished in the final furlong. MR. LUV MAKER raced at the inside of the
chasing flight, was pushed along in the three to four path on the turn, swung out and raced under a drive five wide in upper stretch, and lacked the needed
kick. LEE'S LUCK broke sharply, tracked three wide early, continued to track the leader in the three path on the turn, was driven four wide in upper stretch,
and weakened. BUDDY BUD was anxious in the gate, settled at the rear of the main pack, continued toward the rear in the six path on the turn, floated into
the stretch eight wide, and made no rally in the lane. MIDNIGHT JOKER was void of early speed, trailed in the three path on the far turn, and mustered no
bid. KYZAN chased four deep down the backstretch, continued midpack in the six path on the turn, floated out nine wide into the lane, and came up empty.

SEMI CHARMED DAY veered in slightly and bumped with the horse his inside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, chased the leaders on
the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the turn, launched a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, kicked clear entering the
stretch and continued to draw away to win handily. PACKED HOUSE dueled for the lead from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch,
continued around the far turn still in the three path, could not go with the winner in the stretch but chased him home gamely to hold second. FINAL CALL
navigated the first turn from the four path, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn, began a bid
passing the three eighths pole, drifted out and bumped with BE YOUR OWN HERO at the three sixteenths pole, and had repeated mild contact with that
rival while gaining ground on the inside in the final furlong. SIN CITY SLICK bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the
first turn, settled in in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, swung wide on the far turn to find racing room, entered the stretch
in the four path and gained ground on the outside in the final furlong. BE YOUR OWN HERO raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leaders
between horses up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path, was bumped by FINAL CALL near the three sixteenths pole and then
raced in tight quarters with mild contact from that rival while being outkicked late. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled
for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path, raced between horses in close quarters in upper stretch and
weakened late. OFF TO THE BEACH raced in the five path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, moved in slightly
to run in the two path around the far turn, offered a mild bid near the quarter pole and faded from there. ZARMAE brushed with the horse to his outside
leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far turn from
the three path and was empty in the stretch. B'S TURNING POINT brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the
first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, improved position while saving ground around the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. BOOGY SOKS
reared up in the gate before the break, raced in the three path around the fist turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside,
navigated the far turn from the three path and made no bid. SILVER HIT navigated the first turn from the four path, stalked the frontrunners on the outside
up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn and faded in the stretch. TO THE BANK raced in the three path around the first turn, continued
up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, came around the far turn in the two path and tired from there.

Footnotes
PRESENT OF HERO chased behind the tracking flight, was pushed along and rallied up the rail around the far turn, sustained her rally inside of LAVERNS
LASS in upper stretch, led past the quarter, and drove clear. KURINGAI settled toward the rear inside of COUNTRY ASSETS through the first turn,
continued two wide toward the rear down the backstretch, was urged in the three path on the far turn, came into the lane under a drive inside foes in upper
stretch, rallied, proved no match for the winner but got up best of the rest. CLOSE TO ME chased midpack, was pushed along in the two to three path on
the far turn and responded with a rally, was driven four wide in upper stretch, continued to improve but was outkicked for the place. COUNTRY ASSETS
settled two wide toward the rear, raced between horses in the rear flight on the far turn, swung out and rallied four wide in the lane. CHOLLA tracked the
leader, raced keenly into the backstretch, tracked the leader in the three path on the far turn, encroached past the five sixteenths, came into the lane three
wide in the leading flight, proved no match for PRESENT OF HERO, and weakened in the final furlong. LITTLE CHICK settled at the inside of the rear flight,
began to take closer order past the eleven sixteenths, raced at the inside of the rear flight through the far turn, improved in upper stretch but could not
sustain her rally in the final furlong. LAVERNS LASS was sent for pace, took pressure briefly from LADY WARRIOR into the backstretch, continued to set
the pace in the two path on the far turn, was confronted by CHOLLA near the five sixteenths, came into the lane between horses, was headed past the
quarter pole, and weakened in the final furlong. TANNAH'BLU raced two wide in the rear flight through the first turn, trailed down the backstretch, was
pushed along three wide with the rear group on the far turn, and lacked the needed rally. KARA'S ANGEL chased two wide, continued midpack three wide
on the far turn, and was outpaced in the lane. LADY WARRIOR tracked the leader outside of CHOLLA, advanced to press the pace briefly into the
backstretch, settled back to track again shortly thereafter, was hard urged into the far turn, but weakened in the five path and was no further factor in the
stretch.

up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, launched a bid between horses with a furlong to go and continued to gain ground from there.
MELISSANI raced in tight quarters in the three path around the first turn, moved up to duel for the lead entering the backstretch, took over to lead outright
headed into the far turn, entered the stretch from the two path and gave way while drifting out mildly in the final furlong. EMILY BUG led the field from the

final furlong to finish evenly. MAGNITUDE TEN bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, came around the far turn in the four path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. DOGWOOD

far turn, tracked the leading pair in the three path around that bend, was driven three wide into the lane, chased while no match for PRETTI XTREME late,
and lost the place late. SISTER RULER was placed on the lead, took mild pressure from AUNT DOROTHY near the nine sixteenths, was challenged by
PRETTI XTREME to her outside from the seven sixteenths, vied inside of that foe to the furlong mark, and weakened. VIVA FOREVER was reluctant to

wide into the second turn, chased in the four to five path around that bend, raced into the lane in the six path, and kept on mildly to maintain position.

TAK dueled for the lead between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, was joined by a new challenger in upper stretch and dug
in gamely to maintain his lead to the wire. INDIAN SIGN pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, launched an
inside challenge passing the quarter pole, dueled in upper stretch and was outkicked to the wire, the best of the rest. JEFF THE LION raced in the middle of
the pack on the outside early, began to move up from the three path around the turn, and continued to gain ground on the outside down the lane. D' YANK
was away from the gate slowly, settled off the pace between horses for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, and gained ground
on the outside in late stretch. PRINCE ABUBU raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, began
a bid from the rail approaching the three sixteenths pole and finished evenly. TUFF ATTACK hit the gate leaving it, dropped back to trail the field up the
backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch from the two path and passed tiring horses while drifting out some in the stretch. COWBOY TUFF
pressed the pace from the outside up the backstretch, improved to duel for the lead from the three path around the turn and into the stretch and tired in the
final furlong. GIVIN UP NONE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the opening stages, launched a bid from the rail nearing the three eighths

Footnotes
PLAY TWENTY was reluctant to load, broke a step slowly, advanced quickly and a bit keenly through the field to join three deep in the tracking flight, bid on
the leader in the three path past the seven sixteenths, edged clear past the three eighths, increased her advantage in upper stretch, drift out late but
remained well clear under a drive. DRIVE LINE tracked the leading pair inside of SOULANDGRACE early, chased the leading trio in the three path on the
turn, was pushed along past the five sixteenths, saved ground to the stretch, was no match for the winner but chased on willingly to the wire. RONAN settled
near the rear early, rallied in the five path on the turn, went to a drive past the five sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, and continued with interest
while proving no match for the leading pair. APPLE VALLEY chased midpack while saving ground, went to a drive in upper stretch, was taken three wide
approaching the furlong mark, and rallied mildly. COOKIN ROSES set the pace while taking pressure from GOTTA B THE SALSA to her inside, raced
keenly on the lead into the turn, was caught by PLAY TWENTY past the seven sixteenths, proved no match for that foe, was driven two wide in upper
stretch, and weakened. GOTTA B THE SALSA was reluctant to load, attended the early pace inside of COOKIN ROSES, tracked the leading pair in the
three path on the turn, swung four wide in upper stretch, but weakened in the drive. SOUTHERN ATTACK chased three wide early, raced patiently in the
four path on the turn, was taken out seven wide into upper stretch, and improved mildly past tiring horses. THE MORE I BURN settled in second last, raced
in the three path on the turn, was taken three wide in upper stretch, and passed tired horses under a drive in the lane. SOULANDGRACE was awkwardly
into stride, tracked the leading pair two wide, began to flatten into the turn, chased while losing ground in the four path on the turn, and continued to weaken
in the lane. BLAZING RUBY chased two wide early, continued midfield in the three path on the turn, raced two wide into upper stretch, and weakened.
LOCASH settled at the rear, trailed through the turn, floated six wide into upper stretch, and lacked a rally. MIDNIGHT FROST was taken toward the rear
early, saved ground through the turn, and came up empty inside in the lane.
