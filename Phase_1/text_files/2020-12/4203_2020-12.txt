the stretch, moved a bit and split foes at the sixteenth pole and proved best of the trio. SASSYSERB settled along the inside, shifted two wide into the
stretch, bid outside the leader at the eighth pole, challenged through the final furlong and got outkicked by the winner. AUNT LUBIE sped clear, set the pace
from inside, met challenger at the eighth pole, fought back in the furlong grounds and yielded grudgingly. GO BIG BLUE NATION reserved in the early
going, traveled outside a rival, angled out around the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and finished willingly. HERMAPHRODITE (FR) floated out
leaving the gate, traveled three deep to the far turn, angled out a path around the bend and kept on willingly while outfinished for a minor award. SHANGHAI
TRUFFLES floated out soon after the start, tracked the speed two wide then three wide around the far turn, bid three wide in upper stretch but flattened out.
COVER VERSION bumped rival at the start, trailed the field early, angled out around the far turn and never threatened. KOOKIE GAL pulled early from
inside, tracked the pace then angled three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. TIZNO'S DILEMMA shifted out soon after the start, angled to the rail early,

Footnotes
ALVAARO chased the leader into the first turn then checked off heels sharply at the the seven-eighths pole, angled outside rival then went up to dueled for
command, battled with that rival to upper stretch then cleared at the eighth pole and widened to the wire. HAPI HAPI steadied into the first turn, tracked
between rivals then off the rail, went two to three wide around the far turn and rallied for the place. NEXT REVOLT chased outside a rival then two to three
wide around the second bend, lugged in at the sixteenth pole and lost the place. BAM BAM AGAIN away quickly from the outside, cleared the field and
angled to the inside, dueled with rival up the backstretch, around the far turn, and upper stretch, lost contact with rival at the eighth pole and weakened
inside. DEFENSE WINS stalked the pace from inside, came a bit off the rail in the stretch, angled out further at the eighth pole but flattened out. BODEGA
lacked early speed, saved ground into the stretch and passed tired rivals. TROMADOR raced off the pace, went three wide into the lane and could not rally.
ZORICH bobbled leaving the gate, stalked outside the top pair, dropped back on the far turn, eased in the stretch and crossed the wire, then walked off
following the race.

Footnotes
SMOOTH LIKE STRAIT up close outside the leader, applied pressure around the far turn, gained command in upper stretch and edged away from rival
under a drive. STORM THE COURT sped to the front and angled to the inside, showed the way along the rail to the far turn, asked when challenged around
the far turn, lost command in upper stretch but stayed on to prove a game second. WHISPER NOT (GB) pulled early from inside, remained along the fence
stalking the pace, lacked room into the stretch, tipped out in the lane and held the show. FIELD PASS broke in and bumped rival, stalked the pace in the two
path, exited the far turn three wide and missed the show. SCARTO went three deep into the first turn then traveled outside a rival, entered the far turn two
wide, angled out and came four wide into the stretch and missed the show. STRONGCONSTITUTION saved ground throughout and never rallied.
HEYWOODS BEACH traveled between foes into the first turn then eased back and to the inside, went two wide around the second bend and lacked further
response.

Footnotes
WARREN'S MEMORABLE raced off the rail while in range, angled in then back out around the turn, bid three wide upper stretch and kicked clear. HALF
HOPING chased three to four wide around the bend, drifted in a bit at the eighth pole and bested the rest. MEDUSA'S GAZE sent for the lead early, took
control then pressed outside a rival, headed that foe at the quarter pole, led into the stretch but proved no match in the late stages. BIG CHICK broke inward
then was sent for the front from inside, held a short lead up the backstretch, headed by rival at the quarter pole, lost command into the drive and weakened.
GREAT CURVES trailed the field early, went four wide into the lane, tipped out further in the stretch and lacked a rally. HERE COMES RALPHIE bumped
both sides leaving the gate, raced two wide then shifted in at the three-sixteenths pole and could not rally in the lane. GRAZEN ROAD traveled mid-pack,
angled to the inside on the turn and also lacked a rally. MS MICHELLE showed early speed then steadied between rivals, tracked off the inside and came
up empty. WATCHFUL EYE came in and bumped rival leaving the gate, showed early speed four deep then chased the top pair, raced four then three wide
around the turn, eased in the drive and walked off. MISS TATER TOT bumped and lost path at the start, stalked up the backstretch, saved ground into the
lane and faded.

outside a pair of rivals early, took the turn four then three wide and flattened out. RAYRAY traveled along the inside, two wide in upper stretch and could not
rally. CLUB ASPEN trailed the field early, swung out into the lane and improved position. PREACHING TRAINER chased off the inside, angled four wide
exiting the bend, came in during the stretch run and never rallied. WAYNE O chased off the rail, went three then two wide around the turn and faded.

FAIR MAIDEN sat off the pace early, raced three to four wide around the turn, rallied outside and collared rival mid-stretch then drove clear. GOLDEN
PRINCIPAL stalked five wide up the backstretch, chased four deep at the quarter pole, closed in and took over in upper stretch, challenged from outside
mid-stretch and could not match the winner late. MERNEITH chased from inside to the stretch and held the show. FINITE trailed the field into the turn, raced
two wide then angled out around the bend, entered the stretch four wide and finished willingly for a minor award. SECRET KEEPER up close three deep,
between rivals or two wide around the bend and failed to find the needed late kick. PROVOCATION unhurried in the beginning, traveled three wide into the
lane, crowded between rivals upper stretch, angled to the outside and showed late interest. HIMIKO chased between foes early, lost ground nearing the
turn, angled out in the lane and lacked room late. BIDDY DUKE set the pace in the two path to the stretch, lost command at the top of the lane and gave

Footnotes
DUOPOLY sped clear and established the front, took control of the rail position, set all the pace to the stretch and drew away under right-handed urging.
GOING TO VEGAS in range while outside a rival, went three wide around the far turn, stayed within striking distance in the drive but failed to threaten the
winner late and bested the rest. SHARING rated in the two path early, chased two wide through the far turn, could not summon the needed response but
saved the show. RED LARK (IRE) traveled along the inside the tipped out into the two path, went outside a rival into the lane, angled out and missed the
show. CAPITAL STRUCTURE (GB) settled off the pace, traveled two wide then a bit off the rail, angled to the inside late and finished well along the fence.
LUCK MONEY tracked three wide then angled out and raced five wide in upper stretch and could not rally. MISS ADDIE PRAY tracked the pace from
inside, saved ground into the lane and weakened. NEIGE BLANCHE (FR) stalked outside a rival, traveled two wide then tipped out at the three-sixteenths,
raced four wide in upper stretch and also weakened. CALIFORNIA KOOK off a bit slow to begin, went three wide through the first turn, remained off the rail
then angled five wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. GUITTY (FR) off a bit slowly, pulled early into the backstretch, swung six wide into the lane and was
never a factor.

CHARLATAN stalked the leader up the backstretch from outside, drew alongside and headed NASHVILLE at the quarter pole, quickly took over exiting the
turn, cleared rival and shifted inward in upper stretch, drew off under strong handling then ridden out in the final sixteenth. EXPRESS TRAIN settled early
while racing widest up the backstretch, took the turn three wide, could not make any impact on the winner in the late stages but stayed on to hold the place.
COLLUSION ILLUSION tracked the leader from inside to the lane, angled out in upper stretch and finished willingly. NASHVILLE sped clear and set the
pace up the backstretch, challenged by CHARLATAN approaching the quarter pole, relinquished control into the stretch and weakened. INDEPENDENCE
HALL chased outside a rival or two wide, angled out at the top of the lane and weakened. THOUSAND WORDS chased off the inside, dropped back in the
two path around the turn and came up empty in the lane.
