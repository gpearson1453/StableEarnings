four wide to upper stretch rallying past the others. CATLIKE chased through the turn weakening along the rail in upper stretch. PLAYFUL UNION slow early
would improve past tired ones on the inside. SMOKED PAPRIKA played no factor. THALIA'S SONG raced mid pack tiring in upper stretch. SI MAMACITA
was never involved. KIM'S KREW was always outrun.

WAR AT SUNRISE launched an inside bid on the final turn dueling from the rail down the stretch prevailing gamely. COUNTY COURT well rated rallied on
the far turn dueling three deep then abreast foe in the late stages being denied by a very game rival in the final yards. TUF INTENSITY rallied to lead on the
final turn then dueled between rivals in upper stretch being in a bit close after ceding to foes late. WORLD OF PROSPECTS slow early lost ground to upper
stretch finishing evenly seven wide. SUPER BEAU a factor early was done after a mile and a quarter. REVIVE AND RESURGE was always outrun. BEING
THERE hustled off early was used up after a mile. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF TUF INTENSITY AGAINST THE RIDER OF WAR AT SUNRISE
FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
PRADO'S TRUST slow early circled out to upper stretch bidding widest in the seven path clearing late. CARINA pressed on the backside dueling through
the far turn digging in from the three path down the stretch ceding grudgingly in the final yards. CALENDULA pressed on the backside dueling three deep on
the far turn extending into upper stretch coming up a bit short in the six path. ORIENTAL LADY raced mid pack rallying in upper stretch angling in to the four
path hanging late. GOT THE GIST tracked the pace chasing on the far turn weakening in upper stretch. LADY KIM set the pace dueling on the backside
through the far turn extending in upper stretch wearing out late at the rail. CHASING THE KITTY played no factor. COURTLY KITTY was never involved.
TICKET TO RICHES was always outrun.
