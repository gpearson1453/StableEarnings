Footnotes
CHLOE ROSE set all the pace along the inside and held gamely to be clear late under steady handling. OUR BELLA NICOLE was allowed to settle early,
raced three wide into the lane, moved up four wide nearing the eighth pole and finished well to be second best. SHOOTINFORTHEMOON stalked the pace,
raced along the inside through the stretch and had not enough in the drive. FACTOR IN was unhurried early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had
no late rally. EPHEMERAL stalked the pace and weakened along the inside. REGAL BILLEE dropped back early, raced in a bit tight past the quarter pole
along the inside and never threatened. Jockey filed an objection for interference past the quarter pole against Our Bella Nicole and stewards ruled no
change. MY MAGGIE MOO raced six wide at the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GULLEY was slow early, moved up four wide nearing the eighth pole and finished well to just get up under strong encouragement.
ESCAPABILITY was quick to begin to set all the pace, was well clear inside the eighth pole and just missed in a game effort. THE BIG K tracked the leader
while racing along the inside down the backstretch and kept on in the drive while continuing to race near the rail. INDEFATIGABLE stumbled at the break,
raced two deep and had not enough in the drive. EXTRASEXYBIGDADDEE was allowed to settle early on, raced two wide through the lane and had no
response. BROTHER SKYE failed to sustain a bid.

UNO TIGRESS raced up close and tracked the pacesetter through early stages, launched a two wide bid for EXCESS CAPACITY entering top stretch,
stayed on gamely under steady pressure through the stretch run and wore down foe to prevail in late stages. EXCESS CAPACITY established the lead in
opening stages and continued to hold firm around the turn, cut the corner entering top stretch while shaken up for the drive, remained determined along the
inside but could not hold off the winner late stretch. REMAIN ANONYMOUS settled along the inside and saved ground down the backstretch, shifted out
near the quarter pole and sustained a three to four wide run through the lane. SARAH'S TREASURE raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn, shifted
out turning for home, continued to move out wider while showing some interest. BLUEFIELD raced in range through early going, roused four to five wide into
stretch and needed more for impact. MAE SAI PRINCESS raced in range, hustled up on the turn but failed to advnace. PRINCESS ADIRA veered out at the
start, raced wide early and faltered.

Footnotes
FORTUNATE FRIENDS raced up close in opening stages then advanced four wide to take a clear advantage, continued on top around the turn then came
under attack from THE CAIRO KID top of the lane, briefly lost the lead then dug back in gamely from the inside, took back command and remained clear
under steady pressure. NOMO RON settled nicely while rated in hand off the early pace, continued patiently handled and saved ground around the turn, cut
the corner and launched a bid turning for home and stayed on with steady response to secure second best. THE CAIRO KID raced near equal terms for the
lead out of the gate then tracked up close along the inside, picked up the pace and edged past a duo then angled out and set sights on the leader,
advanced under pressure to take over a slim lead from eventual winner but could not sustain needed kick and weakened to show. TAP THE MARK raced
off the early pace, launched a three wide bid leaving the turn then failed to move on in the lane. LET'S PLAY NINE was forwardly positioned tracking three
wide through early stages, hustled up four wide turning for home then faded in the lane. LANIER raced off the pace, urged four wide entering top stretch but
lacked a needed rally. ABIDING STAR vied for the lead in the opening quarter then failed to keep pace and faded on the turn.

Footnotes
MCELMORE AVENUE matched strides briefly then established a clear lead down the backstretch, continued to hold firm on top around the turn, drifted out
wider while under strong right-handed pressure, continued to drift out but remained clear. BENANDJOE raced in stalking mode behind the leader in early
stages, saved ground and picked up the pace along the inside around the turn, lodged a bid for MCELMORE AVENUE top of the lane, continued a steady
effort but could not reach the winner. YOUNGEST OF FIVE tracked the pace down the backstretch then hustled up two wide on the turn, got in behind
drifting out winner near the furlong grounds then shifted in under right handed pressure and stayed on with interest. ACE NINE NINE rated off the early
pace, saved ground along the rail entering top stretch, tipped out a path and lacked a needed rally. TOY raced off the pace, hustled along four wide into
stretch but failed to gain a threatening position. PAUL THE WAITER urged five wide entering the top stretch and could not muster a needed rally. MARKET
MOVER rated through early stages, came under a ride two wide on the turn then gave way in the lane. STONE COURAGEOUS stumbled badly at the start,
trailed the field and raced wide into the lane while never moving into contention. The trainer of #3 YOUNGEST OF FIVE lodged a claim of foul against #9
MCELMORE AVENUE for interference in the stretch, after review stewards took no action

Footnotes
HALFINTHEWRAPPER took the lead out of the gate and held the clear advantage around the turn, shook off bids turning for home, opened up to clear
command, stayed sharp on top and finished going away while ridden out. SARATOGA BEAUTY raced in contention and tracked the leader through early
stages, made a move for HALFINTHEWRAPPER nearing the quarter pole, remianed in strong contention entering top stretch but could not go on with
strong winner and settled for second best. STAY OUT chased in range into the turn, hustled along up along the outside through the stretch run and stayed
on for a share. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY raced off the pace, steadily hustled along near the inside and lacked the needed response for serious impact.
PROUD MANDATE raced off the pace then moved into stretch run five wide, angled in a couple paths and failed to pose a threat. ALWAYS SOMETHING
chased in range, hustled along two to three wide into stretch run then gave way in the lane. GRAND SKYLARK got in tight between foes in early going then
got clear and failed to advance around the turn. TUNSTALL saved ground while not too far back early on the failed to keep pace and faded.
SPLASHERSTOWN broke out at the start, raced off the pace then along the outside into the lane and failed to move into contention.
