Footnotes
ALWAYS MISBEHAVING set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and widened under left-handed urging. CUY was bumped on both sides
at the start, raced off the pace four wide, made a four wide move nearing the lane and finished willingly to be clearly second best. TONE FEELIN saved
ground off the pace, angled out nearing the quarter pole and was along for the show. ISLE OF MAN was soundly bumped at the start, raced well back
inside, made progress at the rail around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and was one-paced in the lane. ALPERES bumped with OPTIMISTIC early,
saved ground in range and came up empty in the lane. TREASURE RUN stalked the pace three wide around the first turn, bid two wide nearing the far turn,
pressed the winner around that bend and tired in the lane. OPTIMISTIC was bumped early, chased the pace two and three wide and retreated through the
lane. SMARTY J AND B vied outside of the winner around the first turn and was through after a half. REINOANIMAUX came out and bumped hard at the
start and was outrun while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
MARKISTAN tracked from midpack along the inside under steady urging to sustain position, saved ground around the turn before shifting four wide in upper
stretch, then produced a rally in the final furlong, and just got up at the wire in a tight photo. BEAST OF WILDWOOD pressed the pace two wide and
between horses early on, took back to stalk those rivals from the inside around the turn, tipped outside of them at the quarter pole, sustained a bid to forge
an advantage passing the furlong pole, but was run down and nailed on the wire by an outer oncharging rival. SALSA RITA prompted the pace three wide,
then two wide into the turn, inched closer to forge an advantage passing the quarter pole, clung to a margin in upper stretch as BEAST OF WILDWOOD bid
alongside, but was headed by that foe passing the furlong marker, and gave way. BAHAMIAN GIRL broke a bit inwards and brushed the gate at the start,
recovered to set the pace while feeling stern pressure from an outer rival around the turn, but was headed by that foe and another rival in upper stretch, and
weakened. BABY ICE lied off of the pace in the three path around the turn, shifted to the four path turning for home, but lacked a kick to make a bid.
TAKECHARGE MIRELLA saved ground far off of the pace, but failed to factor. DIXIE PRINCESS hopped at the start and was off multiple lengths behind the
field, trailed the field while taking the turn in the five path, and never got involved.

Footnotes
WILLY BOI received a bump from an outer rival at the start, recovered to duel for the lead inside of a trio of foes, shook clear from those rivals while in hand
approaching the five sixteenths pole, was roused straightening into the lane as PROUD CONTENDER pursued, came under right handed driving pressure
passing the sixteenth pole as that foe inched closer, but safely held at the wire. PROUD CONTENDER stalked the quartet of duelers from along the inside
down the backstretch, progressed along the rail in the early half of the turn, shifted off of it at the five sixteenths pole to take aim on the clear leader, then
sustained a grinding bid through the lane under left handed pressure, but lugged in greenly approaching the wire causing the rider to give steadying
correction, and failed to reach the leader. THE RED MAN broke inwards and bumped the eventual winner at the start, dueled for the lead three wide and
between horses early on, but failed to keep pace passing the three furlong pole, sustained chasing position turning for home, then held show through the
lane. HAPPY CHAMP lied far off of the pace two wide around the turn, and stayed on through the lane for a minor share without threatening. SIGILOSO
was off a bit slowly without incident, was urged along while off of the pace, took the turn in the five path, and failed to factor. CAPTAIN shied from an outer
foe at the start, then saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. TALEOFTWOBROTHERS dueled for the lead four wide, but weakened at the three
furlong pole, and was done early. BELLA FUTURE dueled for the lead three wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner
approaching the five sixteenths pole, and weakened thereafter.

Footnotes
STAR SWEPT raced off the pace three wide for a half, made a quick four wide sweep to the front around the far turn, took the lead nearing the quarter pole,
quickly cleared and angled in, opened up through midstretch and held clear under a drive. SHE FLED THE SCENE saved ground off the pace, tipped two
wide nearing the quarter pole, waited for room until upper stretch, angled out and rallied on the left lead. STORMY DERBY DAY was bumped at the start,
saved ground well back for six furlongs, swung out leaving the quarter pole, came eight wide into the lane and rallied widest. MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT saved
ground in range and lacked a rally. NOBLE MARIA was bumped at the start, chased the two and three wide and was one-paced in the lane.
EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE set the pace in the two path around the first turn, angled in for the far turn, was collared nearing the quarter pole and tired through
the stretch. GLORIOUS GAL was bumped at the start, prompted the pace two wide and retreated through the final quarter. CACTUS KITTEN broke about
two lengths behind the field and was never a factor while racing two and three wide. RECESS had some speed three wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
ROYAL MEGHAN set the pace inside of a trio of hounding foes, shook clear turning for home, widened her advantage through midstretch under driving
pressure before being put to a hand ride late. BRAMBLE BERRY vied for the lead three to two wide around the turn, failed to keep pace with an inner foe
passing the five sixteenths pole, but sustained the chase of that foe through the lane, and proved second best while well clear of show. MISS PEPPINA
tracked from off of the pace three wide, shifted four wide into the turn, then to the five to six path in upper stretch while failing to keep pace with the leaders,
then passed tired foes for a minor share without threatening. WORTH AVENUE hopped at the start, trailed the field in the four to five path around the turn,
and improved. MANDAMUS vied for the lead four to three wide around the turn, but failed to keep pace with inner foes turning for home, and weakened
through the lane. JESSICA was a bit fractious in the gate before the start, stalked the quartet of leaders from along the inside, shifted to the three path
turning for home, but lacked a rally. NACHO MAMA tracked the pace two to three wide and between horses, but faded around the turn. UNCAPTURED
RUBY vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened into the turn and was done early.

Footnotes
WAR CANOE settled off the early pace while racing two wide, advanced four deep rounding the far turn, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, dueled inside
of I'M LISTENING from there and prevailed under stout left-handed urging. I'M LISTENING broke a bit awkwardly, raced well back two wide, advanced three
deep around the far turn, angled five wide into the lane, dueled outside of the winner under hand urging and just missed. CALENTITA (IRE) saved ground
off the pace, was blocked nearing the lane, got clear near the three-sixteenths pole, angled out and rallied between rivals. CODRINGTON lagged well back
inside, swung widest in upper stretch and had a mild rally. O. K. KAY tracked the pace two wide and lacked a rally. UNA LUNA prompted the pace two wide,
reached even terms midway around the far turn but weakened in the lane. SOOTHING stalked the pace three wide, checked near the five-sixteenths pole
and had no further bids. INTEREST set the pace along the rail and tired.

Footnotes
MOONLITE STRIKE vied for the lead through a quick pace inside of a pair of foes, forged an advantage approaching the half mile pole, managed it around
the turn before kicking clear passing the three sixteenths pole, tired through the final furlong as his stablemate produced a bid, drifted out a bit approaching
the wire, but just held. KIGER was brushed by an outer rival at the start, stalked the trio of duelers from the four path down the backstretch, came under
urging at the half mile pole to keep pace, then was put to an all out drive into the turn, still managed to sustain a left lead rally in pursuit of his tiring
stablemate through the lane, but just missed. HERCULES broke outwards hindering an outer rival, settled far off of the pace, took the turn in the two to three
path before tipping to the five path turning for home, and stayed on for a minor share. REAL TALK dueled for the lead two wide and between horses early
on, vied outside of the eventual winner around the bend, but failed to keep pace with that foe passing the three sixteenths pole, and weakened. ADVANCE
CASH dueled for the lead three wide, but failed to keep pace with inner foes passing the half mile pole, and faded. IRISH HONOR was bothered and forced
out by an inner foe at the start, saved ground around the turn far off of the pace, was outrun, eased through the final furlong, then pulled up distress
approaching the wire, but walked off.

GET REWARDED raced off the pace in the two path with his head cranked to the left around the first turn, angled four wide early on the far turn, surged to
the front in upper stretch and drew clear under a drive. BEAM OF LIGHT raced off the pace two wide early, bid three wide midway around the far turn, took
the lead nearing the quarter pole, was overhauled by the winner in upper stretch and stayed on willingly to be clearly second best. GOOD ON PAPER
lacked early speed while saving ground, moved up three wide around the far turn and was along for the show. OSAKA GIRL pressed the pace two wide,
briefly led midway around the far turn and weakened in the lane. HERA raced in range two and three wide and came up empty in the lane. O'MALLEY failed
to menace while racing three and four wide. MEADOW BEAUTY was pulling early, saved ground in range and tired. CLASSICAL MAGIC set the pace along
the rail and faltered around the far turn.

Footnotes
ALL ABOUT KATHERN lied forwardly placed three wide, vied outside of a pair of foes around the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch while hanging on her
left lead, and secured victory under driving pressure. LITTLE RED FROG tracked from midpack in the two to three path around the first turn, stalked the trio
of leaders around the far turn before tipping outside of them turning for home, but drifted out in upper stretch, proved no match for the eventual leader, then
stayed on to claim place. POSITIVE SKEW was taken back from a bit of tight quarters after the start, trailed the field into the far turn, split foes two wide
while commencing a rally turning for home, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and rallied for a minor share. ROONEY saved ground off of the pace
around the first turn before taking the far turn two wide, then shifted to the five path in upper stretch, stayed on through the lane, but was outfinished by an
outer foe for minor placings. DIVINE MARTHA stalked two wide, vied between horses around the far turn, but proved no match for her outer counterpart
approaching the furlong marker, and tired thereafter. JEANIE'S ANGEL broke out, moved forward to clear the field in the early part of the first turn, then vied
inside of a pair of foes around the far turn before weakening turning for home. BLUES SONGS lied far off of the pace two wide, trailed turning for home, and
never got involved. WICKED SPIRIT lied far off of the pace three wide around both turns, and did not play a factor. GREATER PLAN stalked along the
inside, but faded into the far turn, and was done early.
