FREERUNNING vied five deep early, four deep into the turn, dueled outside WALKING WITH DINO into the drive, put away that rival then met the
challenge of REST EASY TWO FOUR at the eighth pole and held gamely. REST EASY TWO FOUR stalked the speed from outside, went four then three
wide around the turn, tipped out in the stretch, collared rival with a furlong to go and could not get by. PRESTO BENCH brushed from outside at the start,
vied three deep then got squeezed back at the half-mile pole, angled to the rail, angled out around the turn, kept to task through the lane and held the show.
CHIEF JACKSON bumped leaving the gate, stalked off the inside, four to five wide leaving the turn and finished evenly. WALKING WITH DINO bumped at
the start, vied four deep then three deep on the turn, dueled inside the winner into the stretch then gave way. MR. ARTISTIC fractious in the gate, vied
between rivals to the turn, could not match strides leaving the bend and weakened. MY CHILD SBUD vied from inside, failed to keep up midway around the
turn, stayed inside to the stretch and also weakened. SARLAT off slow, traveled off the pace, angled in on the turn, came out some in the stretch and
proved no menace. U AINT RITE raced off the rail into the drive and was never a factor. HALF-MILE FRACTION HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
EMPIRE HOUSE prompted the pace from outside, floated out a bit into the drive, took control in upper stretch, cleared rival at the three-sixteenths pole and
held well in deep stretch. AADHANA traveled near the back of the pace, went four to five wide around the turn, closed outside the leader but needed to find
more in the final sixteenth. MIDNIGHT DIVA off a bit slow to begin, raced off the pace, traveled three wide into the stretch, angled out in the drive and was
closing fast late. DORITA'S HAPPY stalked off the rail, four wide leaving the turn and went one-paced through the final furlong. PHILLY LISHES went two to
three wide into the stretch, angled to the rail in the lane and lacked a bid. WHISTLER'S STYLE took the turn five wide and failed to threaten. DONNA
BELLA set the pace in the two path with company to the outside, held a short lead three wide into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened
through the late stages. BATHORY angled to the inside early, saved ground to the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
D K'S CROWN stalked off the rail, four wide into the lane, took over at the three-sixteenths pole and drew away. FIRE WHEN READY raced off the pace,
went two to three wide around the turn, angled out mid-stretch, rallied and proved second best. ROCKY'S SHOW sped clear from inside, remained
unchallenged into the drive, headed at the three-sixteenths pole, could not go on with the winner but stayed on to save the show. TIZ LOVE traveled
mid-pack early, raced three wide then angled out into the stretch and summoned a mild response. J T'S A. T. M. closest in pursuit early outside the leader,
stayed in range into the stretch, asked in the drive but lacked the needed late kick. ROYAL SEEKER saved ground into the drive and was never a factor.
CAPTAIN N. BARRON stalked the lone leader from inside, angled out on the turn and weakened. TRIBAL STORM traveled near the back of the field,
entered the turn two wide, exited four wide and was never a factor. DIZZY DANCER went three deep into the turn, drifted out around the bend and never
made an impact. CONVEX took the turn four to five wide and had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
HOWBEIT pressed the pace from inside, was in a bit tight at the three-eighths and lost some ground, remained inside to the stretch, rallied and took control
mid-stretch and drew clear. PROMISE NOTHING settled in the two path, steered out widest in the stretch, had the rider lose the whip at the eighth pole,
rallied and edged SILARDI for second. SILARDI set the pace under pressure, held a short lead at the three-sixteenth pole, overtaken soon after and lost
second at the wire. HANDSOME CAT chased two wide into the turn, angled out around the bend, then finished willingly in the final furlong. OCTOPUS
chased along the inside into the turn, angled three wide coming into the stretch, raced between rivals late and failed to find more. BRONN tracked off the
inside, bid three wide around the turn then flattened out in the final furlong. ALCOOLS went three deep into the turn, clipped rival and broke stride at the
three-eighths pole, had the rider lose the irons in the process, was eased into the stretch, pulled up and walked off. AFTER AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS
RULED THAT ALCOOLS CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS AT THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF
FINISH.

PRINCESS TALE forced out in the beginning, angled to the rail quickly, remained inside then moved off the rail and came three wide into the stretch, angled
out at the eighth pole flew late and inhaled rival. KEEP IT CLASSY came out at the start, raced four to three wide around the first turn, unhurried up the
backstretch, angled five wide into the lane, rallied and got up for the place. OUR BONNIE LASS sped clear and set all the pace to the stretch, led clear to
the sixteenth pole but could not stave off the the top pair. SLEW'S SCREEN STAR stalked off the inside, three wide into the stretch and failed to find more
in the late stages. ZAHRA bumped from inside rival at the start, took the first turn three to four wide, angled five wide into the stretch, put in a mild bid at the
eighth pole but flattened out in the final sixteenth. ANATOLIA went four then three wide around the first turn, closed in leaving the backstretch, asked three
then four wide around the far turn and flattened out in the drive. TURKISH ANGEL raced between foes around the first turn, steadied briefly off heels into
the backstretch, angled to the inside, steered out late and was never a factor. LITTLE MISS BELLE broke out and bumped rival, tracked two wide then
saved ground on the second turn and weakened in the lane. MAGICAL SMILE settled off the pace along the inside, saved ground to the stretch and faded.
