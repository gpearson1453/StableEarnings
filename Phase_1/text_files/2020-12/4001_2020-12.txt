Footnotes
SIR ROCKPORT was brushed while not far back entering the turn, raced the three path into the stretch, surged late and was up in time. CALCULATED
THINKIN wasn't far back in the three path, finished fastest and just missed. INTERCEPT set or forced the pace two wide, continued to duel for command
into the final yards and faltered. PETTINBERG dueled along the rail into the final yards and faltered. TEN HUT lagged into the stretch and failed to menace.
PICTOR broke in the air, was hustled inside, steadied in tight nearing the turn, came out into the winner entering the turn, was put to whip soon after,
stopped and was eased up through the lane.

LE GROS BILL was rated in good position along the rail, was sent to the front leaving the furlong grounds and edged clear under urging. SKYWRITING
sped clear soon after the break, stayed out from the rail while making the pace for seven furlongs and continued gamely once displaced. TOP HAT
TREASON steadied soon after ducking out leaving the gate, was slow to settle, angled to the rail on the final turn and gained mildly to the end. An objection
by Diaz against the second finisher was not allowed. MUNTAHEZ settled two wide, angled out nearing the stretch, bumped SHAZAM while moving through
tight quarters three wide between horses entering the stretch, moved closer entering the final furlong then flattened out. SHAZAM wasn't far back in the four
path around the first turn, remained wide around the final turn, was bumped entering the stretch and tired. SEEKING GLORY pressed in the three path to
the stretch then tired. FOURTEEN CARROT trailed.

lane. WE B JAMMIN made the pace in the two path to the stretch then faded from between the top two. FED FEVER was caught wide around the first turn,
gained ground three wide on the final turn then stopped. SO HOT quickly lost contact with the field and was eased up.

FOXY'S EDGE moved to the front before going a quarter, drew clear in the two path midway on the turn and held under brisk urging. ALL ABOUT REYANA
wasn't far back in the three path, vied outside the winner into the final furlong but wasn't enough. O LA LA lagged early then made a late run along the rail.
NEARLY MISSED raced three wide between rivals around the turn and lacked a strong closing. LOFTY REASON raced two wide between rivals in an even
effort. SANSA stayed inside and failed to matter. LISA MILA was outrun. SIX PACK GAL was urged along to make the early pace outside the winner and
was finished after a half. LONG STORY SHORT stopped and was eased up through the lane.

remained clear under urging. MONEYBAGS lagged early, began a run between horses early on the backstretch, raced two wide around the final turn,
moved closer in early stretch then lacked a further response. THE GREAT CASBY raced three wide around the final turn and weakened. CATTLE DRIVE
made a run along the rail around the final turn then flattened out. YO NO SE was no factor. SWITCHBLADE opened a clear lead soon after the break,
angled into the two path, made the pace into the far turn then stopped. BUSTIN THE BANK was outrun. AVAST MATEY chased the early leader for just
over a half then stopped.
