Footnotes
YES THIS TIME angled in early, was taken back between horses nearing the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, was well spotted while traveling
comfortably in third position down the backstretch, came under coaxing in the two path on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, split foes to take the
lead at the three-sixteenths, kicked clear under a right-handed whip into the final furlong, had the rider lose his whip outside the sixteenth-pole and
maintained a safe advantage under a strong hand ride. IMMORTAL was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went three wide on the first turn,
settled at the rear of the field, went two then three wide on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, swung seven wide into the stretch and finished
with good courage to get the place. S MAN broke a step slow then was hustled, moved up to take the lead on the initial straightaway, set the pace on the
inside with company to his outside, was asked while inside on the far turn, lost the advantage inside the quarter-pole then dropped back, kept on in the final
furlong and earned the show. HALF COCKED went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused while four wide on the far turn then driven
six wide into the stretch, held a good striking position between rivals into the final furlong but lacked the needed kick and missed the trifecta. TOUR THE
WORLD brushed with a foe into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled in second flight on the outside, was given his cue in the three path on the
far turn, swung five wide into the stretch under a drive, made a bid at the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. AMES
MISTER was taken up while put in tight against the rail early, settled on the inside, moved up significantly with a half-mile to run, saved ground on the far
turn, shifted to the two path under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. THIRTYMINUTEMASS angled in from the outside early,
traveled around the first turn in the three path, prompted the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, took a brief lead inside the
quarter-pole before losing the advantage to the winner and faltered. ROLL TYLER checked between horses early, was rank under tight restraint into the first
turn, brushed with a foe at that point, was reserved in the two path under a strong hold, went around the far turn in the two path while let out between
horses, shifted three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. (Rail at 8 Feet)

Footnotes
SET HUT broke very fast and left the gate a length in front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was headed at the
quarter-pole, dueled very gamely with the runner-up in the final three-sixteenths and determinedly prevailed. BOOTH ROAD SHINE moved up after the start
to press the pace, vied in the two path while between foes on the turn, took a short lead in the three path at the quarter-pole, dueled with the winner in the
final three-sixteenths and was denied while able to hold the place. SPRING VALUE settled on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, went three wide
on the turn, passed two foes at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed well to get the show.
EIGHTS WILD settled off the pace, was roused while inside on the turn, moved to the two path under a drive while still on his inside lead in upper stretch,
angled out approaching the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly while continuing on his inside lead to the wire. JAKE THE BAND MAN stalked the pace on
the outside, made a bid in the three path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, dropped back passing the three-sixteenths and tired. TEN BROWNIES
was urged along on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BENSON was hustled from the start, chased the leading duo while moving out, went three then four wide on the turn, pursued the leader under a
left-handed whip while still on her inside lead, gained into the final furlong, took the advantage at the sixteenth then moved clear while continuing on her
inside lead to the wire under strong urging. MAKING PROGRESS broke a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn,
angled out in under a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly to get the place. BLONDE ON TAP disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along
the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, shook clear under a hand ride in upper stretch, remained clear into the final furlong, was collared by the winner
into the final sixteenth and weakened then lost the place but was well clear for the show. IM COMING OVER disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the
two to three path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. WAVE OF GOODNESS broke in and a step slow, was ridden along at the rear,
rounded the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch under a drive and failed to threaten. TOUGH BAMA BELLE settled off the pace, was
urged along while inside on the turn, saved ground into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BURNING AMBITION was well placed just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind horses on the far turn, shifted to the two path at the quarter-pole but
lacked room, steadied while continuing to lack room outside the furlong marker then moved out, came between horses to make a bid outside the
sixteenth-pole then scooted clear under a hand ride to prevail. MAGNETISM went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved on the outside, went
three then four wide on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, made a bid into the final furlong, battled into the final sixteenth and was outfinished
while able to get the place. JOQULAR went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked while three wide on the far turn, made a four wide
bid into the stretch, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked then just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. KILLER
DRESS broke a touch awkwardly then was hustled, lugged out three wide into the first turn then dropped to the rail, set the pace through solid fractions, vied
inside on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong, lost the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and was also
out-kicked then just missed the trifecta. ARM CANDY saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging in the two path on the far
turn, was blocked from the quarter-pole to near the sixteenth-pole, steadied in the process, altered to the outside in the final sixteenth and lost any chance.
BLISSFUL CHANGE went around the first turn in the four path, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two path on the far turn, dropped back
under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. STAGE FRIGHT went three wide on the first turn, was reserved at the rear, went two then three wide on
the far turn, came four wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. (Rail at 8 Feet)

strongly to get up late. VERB chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole, drifted in while moving clear in

Footnotes
ELLE Z showed good speed and set the pace, vied inside on the turn, responded well when set down under heavy in upper stretch, disposed of PLAY ON
into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. INTO MYSTIC settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the
stretch and finished willingly for the place. WINNING ENVELOPE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced well back in the field, rounded
most of the turn in the two path then dropped to the rail, angled out near the furlong marker and finished with good energy on her inside lead to get the
show. PLAY ON tracked the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was asked in the three path at the quarter-pole, made a bid in upper
stretch, fought on even terms with the winner into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and was outfinished then just lost the trifecta. A BIT
OF BOTH chased the pace, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. CHANGE OF CONTROL settled off
the pace, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. DANCE RHYTHMS settled off the pace,
was urged three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed response. BEST KEPT SECRET was coaxed along while well
spotted just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and also lacked the needed kick. STERLING MISS broke a step
slow, raced well back in the field, went three wide on the turn, angled out outside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. XANTHIQUE settled outside
under some urging, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. MUCHO AMOR was reserved on the outside, went four to
five wide on the turn, was roused six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. ON PROBATION settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and
showed little. (Rail at 8 Feet)
