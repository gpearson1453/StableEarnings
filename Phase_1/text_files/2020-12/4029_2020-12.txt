DROP DEAD GORGEOUS was away alertly and quickly made the lead, was nicely rated on the front end, widened late under mild urging.
ALLOUTPATRICIA had good position on the inside, could not challenge the winner late but was second best. KITTY EXPRESS chased the winner and went
evenly late. CASPIAN TALE was allowed to settle and failed to menace. PRETTY PENNY slow early was no factor. DARING contended until the far turn
,then tired.

SCARED WARIOR was allowed to settle and saved ground, was no menace late. NANO raced three wide and was no threat. FOX ON THE RUN had good
position early and was through after a half.

A PENN LEGACY quickly set the pace with a clear lead, led throughout and remained well clear while being ridden out. AWESOME OX pressed the winner
early, finished willingly and was second best. MAKING ME CRAZY never far back early, went evenly late. DIAMOND PATRIOT was off slowly and rushed
up down the backside, steadied at the three eight pole and tired in the lane. DUKE OF DARKNESS tracked three wide and had no rally.
FOREVERONYOURSIDE was no factor. HARDLUCK walked out of the gate, trailed and was eased in the stretch to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF THE TILES was away alertly and quickly made the lead, was nicely rated on the front end, led throughout and lasted late. COWGIRL CHROME
had good position throughout, rallied in the stretch and was gaining late. AFLAXENDREAM was unhurried early, rallied in the stretch and was best of the
rest. CONCORDSDIFFERENCE chased the winner and weakened in the stretch. MOTOWN HARBOR was no threat. CRYPTO'S TWIN MILL allowed to
settle, failed to menace. RACEY WEEKEND contended for five eights, then tired on the far turn. VERTICAL TRAIL raced mid pack and gave way in the
stretch.
