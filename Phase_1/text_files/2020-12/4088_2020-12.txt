Footnotes
LADY BREANNA was urged to gain a forward placing prompting the pacesetter three deep racing through the backstretch, took over racing through the
turn, then gamely held several challengers into the stretch to narrowly prevail under firm right handed encouragement. EXCEED THE GOAL settled
between foes dropping off the second flight in early stages, angled four wide racing into the turn, then continued with a steady advance in that path to close
the gap on the winner nearing the wire. SIDEPOCKET BET, urged inside foes pressing the pace through the backstretch, dueled inside the eventual winner
to midstretch but weakened late. DO WHAT IT TAKES was held up off the first flight racing through the chute, then switched out four wide on the
backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path entering the turn to briefly menace the leader, shifted inwards entering the lane and faded late. KWAINA
tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn but offered no rally. TANAGER, reserved last early, failed to menace. MOON OVER VICTORIA
angled inwards while being urged to dictate the pace on a narrow margin between foes through the backstretch, briefly resisted the winner's bid entering the
turn but gave way after a half. CILINGA (MEX) was a brief factor between foes in the second flight but faded early.

Footnotes
STATED took up a position racing off the second flight along the rail through the backstretch, was prompted to advance while shifting out four wide leaving
the midway point of the turn, was carried out in the closing stages but continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage and kick clear in time
under firm right handed encouragement. PLAY THE MAX, a bit reluctant to load, sped clear of the field while angling inwards, dictated the pace on a
comfortable margin in the two path racing into the turn, drifted out while being urged to resist the winner's bid in the closing stages but couldn't fend off that
rival. BROWNSTONEPRINCESS switched out in early stages to track the pacesetter three deep in second flight racing into the turn, couldn't match terms
with the top pair but kept on evenly in the closing stages to prevail for a share. RISEN CHANGE was settled last, switched outside foes racing into the turn,
angled five wide racing into upper stretch and made some belated progress. MISS UNDERSTANDING hopped at the start, was settled inside foes racing to
the turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. CHIQUI THE GRAY angled inwards to track just off the pacesetter between foes racing
into the turn and faded inside rivals entering the lane. ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA, urged to a forward placing along the inside tracking the pacesetter in second
flight, faded after a half. MARDI GRAS GIRL was a brief factor four wide in second flight, but retreated early.

Footnotes
SHIVAREE angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing through the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch
to advance between rivals, moved to wrest the advantage racing past the sixteenth marker and went clear under firm encouragement. JACKSON broke
inwards bumping NOBLE DRAMA, was quickly righted to stalk just off the pacesetter three wide racing to the turn, was prompted to take over midway
through the turn, held sway on a clear margin into upper stretch but faltered in the closing stages while prevailing for the place honors. NOBLE DRAMA,
bumped at the start, was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the turn, angled five wide racing into upper stretch and found his best stride in late
stages to prevail for a share. OLD TIME REVIVAL tracked just off the pacesetter between foes racing into the turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper
stretch and faded in the closing stages. LEGAL DEAL tracked off the second flight just off the inside racing to the turn, angled four wide entering upper
stretch but had no rally. LORD BARNA ducked inwards at the start, was settled along the inside and failed to menace thereafter. MY BOY LENNY broke
sharply, set the pace on a narrow margin in the two path racing into the first turn, then gave way along the inside racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
PIONEER WOMAN broke in the air losing some position to the leaders, tracked off the second flight in early stages, steadily advanced in the three path
nearing upper stretch to wrest command and maintained a clear advantage under pressure. DUDES LAWYER tracked the pacesetter three deep in second
flight, advanced on the pacesetter between foes racing into the lane, shifted inside in late stages and just held for second. RACHEL'S WISH settled off the
second flight racing to the turn, angled four wide into the lane and continued with interest to improve position while just missing for second. BAHAMIAN
MOON tracked the leader inside rivals in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch, then came through very tight quarters in the furlong grounds while
finishing evenly late. WORKINONBEINSINGLE tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and gave way into the stretch. DAWNDETTI, restless prior
to loading, ducked inwards at the start and failed to menace. TRULY AMBITIOUS sprinted clear of the field while angling over racing to the turn, held sway
to upper stretch and abruptly gave out entering the lane. AWESOME VALENTINA broke awkwardly losing contact with the field and trailed to the stretch.

Footnotes
RICKY RUN was rated outside foes from just out of striking distance racing through the backstretch, responded when prompted to advance four wide on the
turn, shifted inwards while moving to wrest command leaving midstretch and just maintained the advantage to the end under firm encouragement.
CONSILIUM, reserved off the second flight while angling inside early, was prompted to advance entering the bend, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and
continued with a steady late response to close the gap while edging a rival for the place honors on the wire. MOZANO tracked just off the first flight inside
foes racing into the bend, shifted out nearing upper stretch to split foes three deep and continued willingly between the top pair while just missing for
second. LITTLE LATER, a bit restless on the parade to the gate, came through close quarters in the opening stages to force the pace outside a rival racing
through the backstretch, edged clear while angling to the inside racing into upper stretch but yielded once headed by the winner. FRENCH KISS ME tracked
off the second flight outside foes in the opening stages, raced five wide on the turn to upper stretch and lacked the needed late bid. WILD ENOUGH, urged
to a forward placing three wide tracking just off the leaders, lodged a brief bid in that path nearing upper stretch but flattened in the drive. NOBLE KING was
settled last racing in hand to the turn, angled six wide entering the lane but passed only tiring rivals. BERRY HILL, urged inside a rival disputing the pace
from the outset into the turn, gave way after a half. ROSE FOR A SAINT settled between foes in the last flight early, was fanned seven wide into the stretch
and had no rally. MUST BE A MONSTER tracked just off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, was prompted to make some brief progress
entering the turn but quickly came up empty. FUEGO proved no factor.

Footnotes
CANDY COVE was urged to join the pace outside foes racing into the first turn, moved clear entering the backstretch to dictate the pace off the rail, widened
the margin under a right handed tap racing into the stretch and drew well clear late in a handy effort. ONE STOP SHOP was urged inside the eventual
winner prompting the pace into the first turn, tracked just off that rival along the inside to the far turn conceding some position, couldn't regain terms with that
foe but continued with a grudging effort to edge a rival for second late. WILLIAM CROTTY, reluctant to load, broke readily, tracked just off the first flight
outside a rival racing to the first turn, shifted three wide after a half while being prompted in pursuit of the leader racing into the far turn but proved no match.
CHARLIES A CHARMER tracked just off the flight along the inside racing into the first turn, angled to the rail on the backstretch while being prompted to
make some brief progress but had no closing bid. UNLOCKTHEPOTENTIAL settled inside foes in the last flight racing to the first turn, shifted off the inside
on the backstretch but failed to menace. NED DEVINE settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the first turn, was caught fur wide after a half while
under some prompting to contend but faded early. UNSPOILED MOMENTS, reserved last to the while shifting out widest entering the backstretch, trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
HEIRESSALL was rated between rivals tracking the first flight from just out of striking distance in the opening three furlongs, readily advanced three wide
entering the turn to press the issue outside a rival leaving the midway point of the bend, wrested the advantage nearing the furlong marker and went clear
under firm encouragement. INDEPENDENT MISS was rated off the second flight racing through the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the turn gaining
some momentum, shifted out to the three path carrying out TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR in the closing stages but continued with interest to prevail for the place
honors late. THE GODDESS LYSSA, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival while angling to the inside leaving the chute, edged away to a clear advantage
racing into the turn, briefly resisted the winner's challenge through the turn to upper stretch but yielded late. TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR, urged to terms prompting
a rival's pace through the backstretch into the turn, lost ground to the leaders nearing upper stretch, then was carried out four wide in late stages while
steadily fading. REAGAN'S ROSE settled near the inside in early stages, angled four wide racing through the lane but offered no rally. CECI VALENTINA
tracked off the first flight four wide through the backstretch into the turn and gave way after a half. MAMA LONGLEGS was always outrun.

D'CRAZINESS, was held up avoiding close quarters along the inside leaving the chute, shifted out three wide racing through the backstretch while
continuing under patient handling, was prompted to advance splitting foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch and wrested a narrow advantage at the
wire under firm left handed pressure to prevail. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN, reluctant to load in the gate, was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to make an early advance to contention five wide racing past the half mile marker, gained a position just off the pacesetter
nearing upper stretch and contested the issue willingly between foes to the end to just miss. FADE AWAY, reserved while angling to the inside racing to the
backstretch, steadied momentarily avoiding tight quarters nearing the far turn, shifted out five wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance,
continued four deep into the stretch and was just outkicked by the top pair. TANGLED WEB, urged through close quarters just after the break to gain the
lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a clear margin to upper stretch but yielded to the top trio late. DON'S MARSH settled outside foes in the opening
stages, was prompted to advance four wide, then three wide between foes into the far turn, continued in that path to upper stretch but lacked the needed
late kick. EXCHEQUER settled between foes in the last flight, angled out three wide nearing upper stretch and continued evenly. GLAD ROCK (GER),
caught in tight quarters, then steadied leaving the chute, pulled against rating tracking off the leaders along the inside, was shuffled back avoiding close
quarters racing into the far turn and soon gave way. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY, urged to contend three wide between foes through the chute to the first
turn prompting the pace, gave way early. THAT'S BUCKBEAK, urged through close quarters between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the backstretch,
gave way abruptly after a half. MY COWBOY, caught five wide, then four wide leaving the chute racing to the first turn pursuing the pacesetter into the
backstretch, gave way between foes racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
CROWN AND SUGAR broke readily to gain a forward placing stalking just off the first flight under light rating in the opening half, moved readily to command
when given her cue racing into the far turn, shifted in holding sway on a clear margin past midstretch and was kept to firm encouragement. REPATRIATED
GEM (GB), off a bit slowly, was reserved out of contention racing three deep to the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path on the far turn,
shifted four wide racing through the lane but continued with a steady late response to prevail for the place honors. LUCKY JINGLE tracked off the first flight
between foes in the opening half, angled out three wide racing into upper stretch and was just outkicked for second. MAKEME DREAM tracked off the
second flight while angling inside early, shifted out racing through the stretch to advance five wide between foes but continued to improve position to the
end. KOURVOISIER (IRE), held up avoiding tight quarters leaving the chute, continued unhurried along the inside to the backstretch, switched out racing
through the far turn, was fanned six wide in the closing stages but continued with a mild bid. ZARINA, reserved along the inside racing to the far turn, angled
out seven wide in the stretch but had no rally. HERE COMES JACKIE angled to the inside early tracking just off the first flight racing to the far turn but
steadily faded nearing the lane. GARDENISTA, caught four wide in early stages tracking just off the first flight, advanced outside the eventual winner
nearing the far turn to lodge a brief bid but came up empty racing into upper stretch. STEELIN MAGNOLIAS, urged to dispute the pace inside rivals from the
outset to the far turn, gave way nearing the lane. CAUGHT UP IN YOU angled inwards while being urged between foes prompting the pace to the
backstretch, gave way abruptly entering the far turn.

Footnotes
TICKET TO ALASKA tracked just off the first flight along the rail through the backstretch, conceded some position nearing the turn, angled out on the turn to
race five wide entering the stretch but produced a stout rally to wrest the advantage in time to prevail in time under firm handling. LIL GREEN MACHINE
broke readily, was urged to gain a forward placing along the rail while conceding the lead after the opening furlong, was urged to press the issue inside foes
on the turn, came through to go well clear midstretch but just failed to contain the winner. WESTWARD LOOK, shuffled a bit avoiding close quarters at the
start, recovered to track outside rivals in the second flight racing to the turn, shifted four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance but
was outkicked by the top pair. MARKET was settled between foes dropping off the second flight, gained some position racing three deep into upper stretch,
then angled to the inside late finishing willingly in hand when racing in close quarters nearing the wire. GOOD BOY ROY, urged three wide prompting the
pace through the backstretch into the turn, pressed the issue to upper stretch and gave way. UNLONELY, urged to the lead between foes, dueled for
command to upper stretch and gave way. PRINCE HAWK, hopped at the start while breaking slowly and failed to menace thereafter. MAUREENS' STAR
tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn but gave way early. BOOM SAUCE proved no factor. BIG POLO retreated early.
