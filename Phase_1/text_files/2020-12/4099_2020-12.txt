under brisk handling to win as much the best. PASSALLTHECANDY stalked the pace three wide into the far turn, inched closer to the lead then was no
match for the winner. VELVET SAMI offered a mild bid two wide on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. DREAMINOFJUSTICE failed to menace.
SWEETALKINGJUSTICE passed tiring rivals. TRUEAMERICANBEAUTY had speed for six furlongs then gave way. SHINY SURPRISE vied for the lead
along the inside into the second turn then flattened out. IT'S SPRINGTIME made the lead soon after the start, set the pace for four and one half furlongs

Footnotes
MOUNTAIN MELODIES away alertly, set all the pace under pressure and wore down rivals in a game effort. AND I KNOW stalked the pace three wide,
engaged the winner two wide at the top of the stretch and just missed in a stretch long drive. BETTER THAN PEARLS allowed to settle, moved up three
wide on the far turn then leveled off. SAFFRON GIRL pressed the pace two wide to the top of the stretch then weakened. LIGHTNING MISS well placed,
lacked the needed response. FORWARD LOOK was through early. PABLO CREEK offered a mild bid along the rail into the stretch then came up empty.

Footnotes
HAKMAN was in tight, steadied at the five furlong pole, track the pace from the four path through the turn, shifted out to the six path for racing room, closed
fast and was along in time. TO WIN was fractious in the gate prior to the start, closed fast outside into the stretch, drifted out to the eight path when struck
with a left handed whip then dug in determinedly but finished second best. TALE OF LACEY stalked the pace three wide into the turn, loomed boldly nearing
the quarter pole, battled until deep stretch then was outfinished. SCORZA contested the lead two wide into the stretch and weakened late. BISCUITS AND
GRITS battled for the early lead along the inside and was through after a half. SUGAR MAC was a forward factor along the rail into the turn then faded.
ACCURATE was outrun. CAN'T CRASHMYPARTY was in tight at the five eighths pole then failed to menace. MOBIL BREEZE was never close. EL
MEZCALITO had speed into the turn then stopped.
