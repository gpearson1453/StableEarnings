Footnotes
IRON LILLY set the pace racing with a clear lead, moved well off the inside, dueled with RISQUE EXPRESS in the final furlong and dug in determinedly to
prevail. RISQUE EXPRESS was off slowly, tracked on the inside, raced between rivals at the quarter pole, dueled in the stretch drive and battled gamely to
the wire. BAAQEYA stalked outside, then chased outside and rallied mildly outside in the lane. FLEUR DE FORCE raced three wide off the pace and had
no rally. GIRL POWDER raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn and did not factor. DANCINGTHEHNYDAWAY raced between rivals, then
chased and faded.

AMERICAN ROMA stalked wide, took the lead mid backstretch, drew clear under mild handling. ACROSS THE AISLE went to the rail early, split foes final
turn and had no late gain. SALSA'S RETURN was never far back, went three wide on the final turn then tired. HIGH FLYING GUY saved ground and tired.
LEGACY'S PRINCE, very wide, failed to menace. NOBLE KENT was never a factor. MANTLE tried bear out on the first turn, dueled inside then stopped.

in the stretch run and yielded grudgingly. DIAMOND SETTER raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn and rallied mildly on the rail. IN EQUALITY
raced two wide off the pace, went three wide at the quarter pole and lacked a rally. NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ stalked outside, chased on the far turn, went four

faded. J J LOVES BILLY was never a threat. UP JUST IN TIME, well placed between foes, tired. GAMBIT'S GIRL dueled two wide, bore out leaving the turn
and tired. DEEP CANYON saved ground just off the pace then stopped.
