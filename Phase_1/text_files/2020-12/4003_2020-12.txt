Footnotes
LIGHTS DOWN LOW broke readily to gain terms with the pacesetter from the outset, prompted that foe racing into the turn, pressed the issue nearing upper
stretch to strike the front and narrowly prevailed in the closing stages under firm left handed pressure in a determined effort. GHOSTED broke out bumping
ADONAI BLESS at the start, was quickly righted, then urged to the lead along the rail in the opening stages setting the pace on a narrow margin, dueled for
command leaving the turn into upper stretch, resisted the winner to late stages but proved only second best. WANNA HAVE FUN tracked off the first flight in
the three path racing to the turn and continued willingly in that path through the stretch to close the gap on the top pair nearing the wire. MAST COVE
shifted off the inside tracking just off the first flight racing through the backstretch and continued evenly in the closing stages. HOLY DIVER settled between
foes in early stages dropping off the second flight, shifted four wide racing into the lane but offered no rally. MANCORA tracked off the second flight outside
foes, was fanned five wide entering the stretch but had no late bid. ADONAI BLESS, bumped at the start, was slow to gather stride, settled between foes in
the last flight and dropped out racing into the stretch.

Footnotes
SHOO SHINE, forwardly placed along the inside in early stages, was eased back while shifting out three wide racing into the turn, continued with a steady
bid to wrest command midstretch and went clear under firm right handed pressure. FLEETRIDGE settled off the second flight racing in the four path early,
gradually gathered momentum while angling five wide near midstretch and proved best of the others. FLIPPING FUN tracked just off the first flight racing in
the three path into the turn but had no closing bid while edging rivals for a share. HAIL SOUTHERN, urged between foes, then along the inside entering the
turn disputing the pace, dueled past midstretch but gave way late. ALL FOOLS DAY, prominent four wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards racing
through the backstretch to press the issue outside a rival on the turn but gave way midstretch. JEHA tracked off the first flight inside rivals racing to the turn
but offered no rally. UPPER SPEED DS dropped out early while angling to the inside.

ALOHA KITTEN bobbled at the break, was righted to track off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted three wide on the far turn
commencing a steady advance to gain terms with the leaders racing into upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. DREAMING OF PARIS,
urged to the lead forcing the pace inside foes into the first turn, dueled for command to midstretch but proved no match for the winner late. MOMS LOVE
settled along the inside in the opening half, switched outside foes racing into the far turn, angled four wide racing through the stretch and continued with
interest to gain some position. MISS WROTE, urged between foes prompting a rival's pace from the outset into the far turn, gave way nearing midstretch.
APOLLO U ANYWHERE tracked off the second flight along the inside, was urged to advance in some close quarters shifting a bit off the inside racing into
the far turn but,came up empty between foes in upper stretch. CLARIST, urged to a forward placing three wide racing to the first turn, angled to the inside to
track off the first flight racing to the far turn but gave way into the lane. BIG ANNIE, urged to gain a forward position outside a rival in the second flight in the
opening half, steadily faded between foes nearing the lane. PASTURE PRINCESS proved no factor. DREAMER'S GETAWAY trailed.

Footnotes
PURIMETER was prompted to gain a forward placing three deep racing just off the pacesetter between foes through the backstretch, advanced entering the
turn to press the issue, edged forward to a clear advantage racing into upper stretch continuing off the rail and held challenges from several rivals in the final
furlong to prevail under strong handling. BOOTLEGGER (FR) tracked just off the first flight between foes racing through the backstretch into the turn, angled
five wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to edge a rival for the place honors while failing to gain even terms with the
winner. SUSPECT A STORM, urged to a contending position racing four wide just off the first flight racing to the turn, advanced in that path to bid between
foes racing through the stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. PASSIONATE HACHI, forwardly placed along the rail in the opening stages, shifted out
racing into the turn tracking between foes, was urged to lodge a brief bid inside the eventual winner in upper stretch but quickly flattened out. PAPACHO
tracked the leaders from out of striking distance along the inside racing to the turn but faded early. SOUTHERN CAL settled outside foes in the last flight,
raced wide to the stretch and was vanned off the course after the race. WAR GIANT, urged between foes dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing to
the turn, gave way into upper stretch. THE GREAT LOUDINI proved no factor.

BIRD'S EYE VIEW broke readily to attend a rival's pace under light reserve racing to the backstretch, came under pressure nearing upper stretch to press
the issue, was fanned three deep between foes in the closing stages contesting the lead but narrowly prevailed on the wire under firm right handed
pressure. J BERESFORD TIPTON angled inwards in the opening stages to track off the first flight between foes while caught in close quarters racing into
the first turn, continued under light reserve to the second bend, shifted out three deep to bid between foes racing into upper stretch, was fanned four wide
leaving midstretch but continued willingly to the end to just miss. WINDRACER (IRE) was urged to lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow
margin while in hand racing to the backstretch, contested the issue while shifting off the inside racing into upper stretch resisting the winner's challenge but
was outkicked by the top pair. AND WON angled to the inside early to track off the first flight, saved ground to upper stretch to lodge a,brief bid inside the
leaders entering upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. SHENDAM (FR) settled last racing to the backstretch, angled out racing past midstretch
while being roused to advance but made no real impression. QUALITY STEP, caught four wide in the opening stages, was rated off the first flight racing
three deep into the backstretch, continued outside foes into the far turn and steadily faded racing into the lane. CAMMACK, forwardly placed three deep
stalking just off the leaders in the opening half, came under pressure to advance nearing upper stretch while being fanned four wide in upper stretch and
soon gave way.

out three deep while responding to pressure to challenge for command racing past the quarter mile marker, was fanned four wide into the lane but went well
clear under firm encouragement. PINSON tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening half, saved ground on the far turn, advanced along the
rail to challenge for command inside foes when presented an opening in upper stretch but couldn't match terms with the winner in the last furlong. THE
CURT FOX (GB) settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out entering the far turn gathering momentum, angled five wide in upper
stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position while prevailing for a share. ANANROAD, urged to a forward placing while angling to the inside
racing to the first turn, conceded the lead while switching outside the pacesetter racing into the backstretch, advanced racing into the far turn to press
between foes into upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. THE STIFLER, hustled to the lead outside a rival racing into the first turn, angled to the rail
once gaining a clear advantage, set the pace to the second bend, briefly contested the lead inside foes but emptied out nearing midstretch. DISCREET
HEAT tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, was caught four wide into the second bend and steadily faded. TY RAN A HOMER

Footnotes
POSEIDONS HEIR was rated along the inside in the opening stages taking up a position just off the second flight, continued under patient handling saving
some ground into the second bend, shifted out sharply in upper stretch to bid three deep between foes and just edged the pacesetter on the wire with a late
surge under firm right handed encouragement. SUNNYMEDE DREAM broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside racing to the
backstretch, edged clear midway through the far turn, held sway on a safe advantage past midstretch but just failed to contain the winner. GET BACK
HOME settled last near the inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes gathering momentum entering the far turn, advanced on the leaders four
wide racing into upper stretch to loom outside the top pair late but was just outkicked. TENERIFE MOON, reserved along the inside dropping well off the
second flight to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn to upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. A FOOLISH FANCY tracked
off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch and continued evenly three deep between foes in the closing stages while no real threat.
CAPTUREMENOW settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and never mounted a serious challenge. HYPERLOOP, urged to a forward
placing three deep racing to the first turn, continued outside a rival as part of the second flight for five furlongs and gave way racing into upper stretch.
WELLINGTONS ROSE, in touch with the pacesetter between rivals racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside stalking just off the pacesetter racing to
the far turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. TAYLOR'S FIRST urged to a contending position outside foes while caught very wide into the first turn,
retreated early.

Footnotes
TAP DANCE FEVER, bumped at the start, pulled her way between foes racing to the first turn to gain a narrow advantage, angled to the rail after the
opening quarter to dictate the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, forged clear racing into upper stretch, then widened the advantage under
firm hand urging while her rider flashed his whip right handed. ZARELLA, prompted to contend between foes from the break, was caught in close quarters
nearing the first turn, then held up off the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued under patient handling to the second bend, split foes three wide
racing into upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors. PAY GRADE settled along the inside dropping well off the second flight to the backstretch,
came under some prompting to advance racing into the far turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch and made some belated progress. SCENIC
OVERLOOK ducked inwards bumping the eventual winner at the start, was urged to prompt the pace outside foes racing to the first turn, continued
prompting the eventual winner through the backstretch into the far turn and gave way into the lane. MY LITTLE MINX, forwardly placed along the inside
racing to the first turn, tracked just off the first flight inside foes through the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked a closing response.
FORBIDDEN DREAM settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the first turn, shifted out five wide on the backstretch to make some brief progress after
a half but emptied out nearing upper stretch. PATSY'S BIG GIRL tracked off the second flight three deep between foes early, continued four wide between
foes on the backstretch and dropped out entering the far turn.

Footnotes
ROYAL COLLECTION was rated off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, was held up momentarily avoiding some tight quarters entering the
bend, shifted three wide on the turn advancing on the leaders, angled to the four path entering the stretch to challenge for command leaving the furlong
marker and held BONITA ANNIE safe under firm encouragement. The latter was off a step slowly, tracked off the second flight along the inside early, angled
out on the turn gradually gaining momentum, angled to the five path racing through upper stretch and produced a solid late response to close the gap on the
winner nearing the wire. CATSOUTOFTHEBAG tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, raced four wide into the bend, was fanned six wide in
upper stretch but continued with some mild interest to edge rivals for a share on the wire. FIGHTRESS joined the pace three wide in the opening stages,
angled sharply to the rail nearing the turn momentarily impeding several rivals, dueled for command along the inside into the stretch but gave out late.
BUCKY'S DRAMA, forwardly placed inside foes attending the pace in the opening stages, switched out of tight quarters racing into the turn to press the
leader through the bend, gained a brief advantage midstretch but failed to sustain that momentum. ALEXANDRA KAY was rated off the first flight inside foes
racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. BAND SWEETHEART, urged between foes in the opening stages pressing the
pace to the turn, gave way into upper stretch. CHICK'S SHADOW, slow into stride, raced wide leaving the turn while training the field.
