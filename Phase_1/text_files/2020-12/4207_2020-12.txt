Footnotes
SEIZE THE HAY took a bump from an inner foe into an outer rival at the start, rated far off of the pace two wide, produced a five wide sweeping move
commencing at the quarter pole, drifted in while bidding for the lead passing the furlong marker, and forged an advantage with a sixteenth to go. GUN OF
GLORY set the pace along the inside, built a clear margin into the far turn, maintained that advantage through upper stretch, but was headed and bested by
the winner passing the sixteenth pole. BEYOND THE CALL lied forwardly placed along the inside, inched closer into the far turn, saved ground around that
bend, then chased the leaders home evenly. SAFE AND SOUND lied off of the pace, took the far turn two wide and between horses, then surpassed foes
on both sides in the late stages to claim a minor award. SOUPER BEST BET stalked two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leaders turning for home,
then faltered further between horses in midstretch. FARM STRONG saved ground while off of the pace, but to no avail. MR. MAZZA rallied five wide around
the far turn before shifting down four wide passing the quarter pole, put TONE FEELIN into tight quarters in the process, then flattened out in upper stretch.
UNPOPULAR OPINION broke outwards and bumped a foe at the start, stalked three wide, but was outkicked by outer foes turning for home, then got
pinched back in a bit of tight quarters in midstretch. TONE FEELIN lied forwardly placed four wide into the first turn, got outmoved by MR MAZZA at the
quarter pole before getting put to tight quarters by that foe, faded, then angled off heels behind UNPOPULAR OPINION inside the furlong pole. GLACIER
PARK trailed two wide and never got involved. BELLAMY'S TREASURE saved ground at the rear, but was outrun and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
SIDARTH was five wide heading to the first turn before taking back and moving in a couple paths, took closer order after a half-mile, bid outside rivals on the
far turn, outdueled BIG FRANK through the stretch and edged away late. BIG FRANK was strung out six wide into the first turn, advanced with a bid
between horses entering the far turn, dueled inside SIDARTH past the quarter-pole and into the lane, steadied and altered off the rail late, and ran on clearly
second best. BELLAGIO got shuffled back between horses on the first turn, moved up through the middle stages toward the inside, could not quicken when
roused early on the far turn, and ran on a distant third. NONA RAC was close up early but steadily lost position up the backstretch and steadied approaching
the half-mile pole, went around four wide with a brief run on the far turn, and flattened out quickly. UNDER FIRE was skittish pre-race, moved in from the
five-path pressing the early pace, and gave way inside the top two finishers on the far turn. KEEPYOURGUARDUP checked sharply on the rail near the
seven-eighths pole, and retired after six furlongs. FRATELLI A. A. became fractious dislodging the rider in the gate, came away in good order and
outsprinted rivals for the lead, and folded up soon after completing a half. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, AND
OBJECTIONS AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER AND TRAINER OF BIG FRANK, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

SOCIALLY ASTRAY trailed down the backstretch, rallied four to five wide and outside of foes around the turn, drove past the leaders approaching the
sixteenth pole, and cleared off before being wrapped up approaching the wire. AUBURN took up between horses early on, lied far off of the pace three wide
into the turn, rallied four wide around the bend to bid for the lead at the furlong pole outside of the pair of leaders while SOCIALLY ASTRAY ranged up along
side, but was outkicked by that foe before securing place. LALALI set the pace along the inside, met GRAVEL GERTIE's bid at the five sixteenth pole, dug
in turning for home as that foe inched a narrow advantage, fought on as a pair of outer foes also made bids in midstretch, but gave way to those rivals
passing the sixteenth pole. GRAVEL GERTIE stalked three wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole and forged an advantage, but faltered between
horses approaching the sixteenth pole. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE lied far off of the pace along the inside and failed to factor. TOO STYLISH vied two wide,
but weakened between horses passing the five sixteenths pole. MY LITTLE JOHARA chased from midpack two wide, but was done early and eased
through the lane.

Footnotes
ULTRACONFIDENT broke alertly and was in range early outside, challenged outside PRINCE IGOR after a half-mile, gained the upper hand into the stretch
and edged away under pressure. PRINCE IGOR pressed the early pace outside COMISKEY PARK, reached a short lead just after completing a half,
battled inside ULTRACONFIDENT turning for home, stayed on his left lead and yielded with a furlong remaining. ENANO ASTRAY was forwardly placed
inside to the stretch, ran on evenly and clearly bested the remainder. HALO'S DANCE moved up mildly into the stretch, stayed on his left lead flattening out
through the furlong grounds, and shied out from left-hand pressure near the sixteenth-pole. SKY BRIDGE settled in the second flight three then four wide to
the stretch, and was making no headway when steadied lightly behind HALO'S DANCE in deep stretch. EXPRESS BOY was outrun for a half three wide,
and improved past tired horses. SIGNIFIED raced four to five wide around the turn, and tired. SMARTY J AND B showed some early speed, moved inside
around the turn, and dropped far back through the stretch. REINOANIMAUX was unsettled at the break and spotted the field three lengths or so, moved up
inside early, and was through after a half. COMISKEY PARK set the pace inside, and gave way after a half. MOON MAN WALKING moved out four wide
through the turn, and made no impact.

LIFECHANGINGEVENT bumped an inner foe at the start, dueled inside of TURN IT ON into and around the turn, shook clear of that foe in upper stretch,
but hung on his left lead through the lane, and just lasted from a group of oncoming rivals at the wire. ROYAL HABIBI got crowded and pinched back a few
strides out of the gate, lied far off of the pace two wide into the turn, swung five wide turning for home, rallied outside of foes through the lane, surged
approaching the wire as the leader tired, but just missed. FLASH TOWN saved ground far off of of the pace, then offered a late kick to split foes two wide
approaching the wire, but missed. SUNSHINE CITY lied forwardly placed two to three wide, chased as the leader kicked clear in upper stretch, but stayed
on to produce a late bid between horses at the leader tired, but got outfinished by multiple foes. TURN IT ON dueled for the lead outside of the eventual
winner, failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, sustained his chase inside the final sixteenth, but was outfinished late by multiple rivals. PINK FIZZ
broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, tracked from midpack along the inside, attempted to sneak inside of SAY CHEESE at the five sixteenths
pole, but had to tap on the breaks as the hole was non-existent, then tipped to the three path in upper stretch, but hung on his left lead and failed to produce
a bid. FAST LANI was off a step slow and got bumped by an inner foe at the start, tracked from off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide turning for home,
but failed to factor. SAY CHEESE stalked along the inside while a path off of the rail around the turn, but failed to produce a bid before weakening in upper
stretch. HEART OF GOD was bumped by an outer foe at the start, trailed the field three wide around the turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
A BEAUTIFUL DAY dropped inside following behind the leaders into the first turn, tracked patiently through the middle stages, came out to the two-path
turning for home, was shaken up coming to the eighth-pole to get past REAL DOOZIE, and edged clear under a mild drive. FEATURE CREATURE broke a
step slow and lagged well back early, swung four wide beginning to find stride at the top of the stretch, and finished with good energy to get up for the place.
REAL DOOZIE grabbed the lead with an alert start, rated along through manageable fractions, shook off AFFICIONADO after six furlongs, could not resist
the winner a furlong out, and was nailed late for second. SCATNAP raced three to four wide throughout, and lacked a solid closing response.
HOPONTHEBUSGUS settled in the middle of the field toward the inside for six furlongs, and could not make her presence felt in the lane. AGUAS
COLORADAS became unsettled early and moved out four wide on the first turn, and never reached contention. AFFICIONADO (FR) prompted the pace
outside REAL DOOZIE for six furlongs, and faded into the stretch. LA INCONDICIONAL had aim outside the leaders three wide midway on the far turn, and
was empty when roused. YAKO broke awkwardly a couple lengths behind the others, got floated out five wide outside AGUAS COLORADAS around the
first turn, and could not gain. FANTASTIC KINGDOM was no factor inside. INTEREST raced at or near the back in the two-path.

RESIDENT set the pace inside of a pressing foe, kicked clear passing the quarter pole, and held safely through the lane stages. AREYOUTALKINGTOME
lied off of the pace three to four wide, commenced a grinding rally passing the five sixteenths pole, forged place at the furlong marker, then cut the leaders
gap through the late stages. AEQUOR stalked three wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader and an outer rallying foe in upper stretch, and chased
them home. TOUPHA lied off of the pace four to five wide, followed AREYOUTALKINGTOME's gain turning for home, and leveled off through the lane
without threatening. ESPRESSO CALIENTE trailed in the two path around the turn, swung six wide in upper stretch, and improved past tiring foes. CAPPY
HOUR vied two wide, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole. FRANK FIRST bumped the gate slightly and was off slowly, tracked from midpack
along the inside, but weakened. SMASH had his head turned to the left when the gates opened and broke a step slowly, chased the pace two wide and from
between horses, and faded.

KISSING FROGS settled well within striking range two wide for six furlongs, overpowered MIMINA'S TEAM from outside through mid stretch and edged
clear. MIMINA'S TEAM prompted the pace inside, bid outside STREET OF DREAMS at the top of the stretch, could not withstand the winner a furlong out
but held on well. CAIRA lost position through the backstretch run, moved up inside entering the far turn, paused a quarter-mile out awaiting a clear path, and
did enough through the lane to get up inside SETTING THE MOOD for third. SETTING THE MOOD was strung out five wide around the first turn, remained
well out in the course turning for home, and finished evenly. MARGARET'S JOY lacked room between horses and steadied at the break, saved ground at
the back for six furlongs, cut the corner improving position into the lane, and stalled in traffic through the final furlong. LOVELY LA LA saved ground outrun
early, moved out three wide around the far turn, and made no significant progress. SANSA'S VOW broke slowly and never factored. PRINCESA CAROLINE
lodged a brief three-wide bid approaching the stretch, and flattened out quickly. STREET OF DREAMS set the pace inside, got overthauled by MIMINA'S
TEAM at the top of the stretch, and folded up. DECLARATIONWARRIOR saved ground early, raced between horses two wide into the far turn, and was
making no appreciable headway when steadied in mid stretch behind horses. MYLASTFIRSTKISS was four wide early, stopped approaching the far turn,
and jogged in far behind.

Footnotes
DR HARLAN tracked from midpack three wide, rallied four wide commencing at the five sixteenths pole to offer a menacing bid for the lead at the quarter
pole, forged a narrow advantage passing the furlong pole while hanging on his left lead as YOUNG RAYMOND rallied alongside, but managed to fend that
foe off to the wire. YOUNG RAYMOND stumbled at the start, lied far off of the pace in the five to six path around the turn, rallied five wide turning for home
after DR HARLAN made first run, then sustained his grinding charge after changing to his right lead inside the furlong grounds, but just missed at the wire.
VINCENT WILLIAM set the pace inside of RED HOT LOOKS early on, dug in to hold an advantage from a trio of rivals approaching the quarter pole, clung
to a minor margin at the furlong pole while hanging on his left lead, but yielded late. STONE HANDS bumped with an inner foe at the star, lied far off of the
pace in the three path around the turn before shifting to the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on for a minor share but failed to threaten. SALSA RITA
took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, recovered to stalk along the inside, attempted to tip four wide approaching the five sixteenths pole as DR
HARLAN rallied along side, but failed to achieve splitting position and got outmoved by that foe passing that marker, then chased the leaders through upper
stretch before fading. TRISOMIA was jostled between horses at the start, lied off of the pace in the three to two path around the turn before shifting out to
the four path in upper stretch, but failed to menace. DARK AGES bumped an outer foe at the start, saved ground while off of the pace, altered to the six
path in midstretch, and failed to factor. FORT KING was bothered by an outer foe and bumped an inner foe at the start, recovered to stalk two wide,
produced a bid three wide and between horses at the quarter pole while getting outmoved by the eventual winner, then weakened thereafter. RED HOT
LOOKS broke inwards and bothered FORT KING at the start, vied for the lead two wide, but caved between horses approaching the quarter pole.

Footnotes
MO READY saved ground in range to the far turn, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, caught DUNDALK from outside through the furlong
grounds and edged away, then held AFRICAN HERITAGE at a safe distance late. AFRICAN HERITAGE was unhurried for six furlongs, split horses rallying
past the eighth-pole, and finished with good energy outside the winner. DUNDALK set the pace inside, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile.
READY SOUL saved ground on the turns, cut the corner putting in a good run, but flattened out through the late stages. CHURN N BURN broke slowly,
raced three to four wide around the turns, and lacked a late kick. HARBOUR MASTER (GB) broke slowly and trailed inside for six furlongs, swung four wide
into the stretch and improved on the far outside. SASSY BUT SMART raced in the middle of the field two wide to the far turn, moved further out approaching
the stretch, and had no rally. GAUGUIN (GER) raced two wide and was never prominent. APRECIADO saved ground early, and never reached contention.
LOMU was forwardly placed three wide for six furlongs, and tired. TAPABILITY prompted the pace outside DUNDALK for six furlongs, and tired.
IKEISGREAT was outrun three to four wide.

MID DAY IMAGE set the pace along the inside, then inched clear of chasing pursuers in the final furlong, and held off IMPERIAL MISSION at the wire.
IMPERIAL MISSION stalked along the inside, shifted to the two then three path around the far turn to attempt a three wide bid, but only managed to chase
the leader home while grinding away at his margin. PROJECTED (GB) lied off of the pace two wide and between horses around the first turn, cut down and
saved ground while stalking around the far turn, then chased the leader evenly through the lane. BELGRANO prompted the eventual winner from the
outside, chased that foe through upper stretch, but tired late. MINISTER'S STRIKE lied unhurried two wide, shifted three wide in upper stretch, and
improved without menacing. ROCKET JOE COPPER was taken in hand at the start without incident, lied off of the pace while caught four wide, advanced
down the backstretch to stalk four wide around the far turn, but faded in midstretch. TIL THE END saved ground while trailing around the first turn, advanced
mildly three to five wide around the far turn, and improved without threatening. DEVOTED KITTEN saved ground while off of the pace, but to no avail.
ZIPPY lied far off of the pace along the inside, and never got involved. DOVER CLIFFS stalked forwardly placed in the three path, but faltered into the far
turn, and was done early. ROBINTAKINCHARGE stalked three wide, but weakened between horses passing the five sixteenths pole, and stopped through
the lane.
