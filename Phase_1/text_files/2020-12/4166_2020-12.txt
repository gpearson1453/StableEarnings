Footnotes
HOLDEN THE LUTE attended the pace outside a pair of rivals, challenged four wide around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew off. ME
MACHO content to lag behind early, settled along the inside, tipped out into the stretch, moved out a bit further in the lane and rallied for the place. TOP
GUNNER set the pace under pressure in the two path, met challengers around the turn and vied two wide into the lane, could not go on with the winner in
the late stages and was edged for the second in the closing moments. CRANKIN pressed from outside, vied between around the turn and into the stretch,
then flattened in the final furlong. PRINCE MAGICIAN chased the top trio from inside, saved ground to the stretch and lacked further response. FULL
DRAW off slow to begin, gave chased three to four wide around the turn and flattened out. MAGICAL ILLUSION chased the speed from outside, lost ground
into the turn, went three wide into the stretch and tired. FINAL TIME HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
CANADIAN GINGER stalked outside up the backstretch, bid four deep around the turn, took over at the top of the lane, drifted in upper stretch, then drew
clear of rivals and was geared down nearing the wire. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN raced off the pace, four wide through the turn, angled out upper, rallied and
nailed DON'T STOP LOOKIN for the place. DON'T STOP LOOKIN stalked off the inside, two then three wide around the turn, split foes at the
three-sixteenths pole, closed well but got edged for second. LADY ON ICE traveled outside a rival early off the pace, took closer order approaching the turn,
chased five then six wide around the bend, showed late effort but was outkicked by the top quartet. MISS KITNESS came away a bit awkwardly and
bumped inside rival, sent for the lead and set the pace with company to the outside, vied with rivals around the turn and into the stretch, then weakened in
the drive. STRADARI pressed from outside, vied between through the turn and also weakened. FLYING BUSINESS bumped at the start, stalked the pace
along the inside and never responded to urging. PEARL DRAGON in range early, bid three deep around the turn and vied into the stretch then faded.

Footnotes
PALM D'ORO set the pace up the backstretch, cleared rival into the turn, inched away around the bend then drew off in the final furlong. ROCKETANN
forwardly placed behind the top pair, went outside rival around the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was clearly second best. WATCH THE FED off
a bit slow and broke in leaving the gate, chased from inside to the stretch and gained the show. FLASHY PASS broke in and bumped rival, pressed from
outside, lost contact into the turn, chased three wide and flattened out in the drive. COCOA CENTS broke in, tracked off the inside, four wide around the
bend and lacked a rally. KISS OF CONGRATS angled into the two path nearing the turn, angled back out leaving the bend and never rallied. BANDON
COLLEEN tossed head and bumped with outside rival at the start, went two then three wide around the bend and weakened. SWEET TOPPER hesitated
and broke in to come away last, trailed the field early off the inside, forced in by rival at the quarter pole and was never a factor. JAYDANN BUS chased
three deep early, three wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch, shifted in at the quarter pole and faded.

Footnotes
CHOLLIMA off alertly and went for the front, set the pace with rival to the inside, cleared that foe then met the challenge from GO SMILEY GO, dueled along
the inside to the stretch, lost command in upper stretch, then dug in through the late stages and bested rival in the final furlong. GO SMILEY GO turned
head to be off slow at the start, went up to be well placed behind the top pair, angled outside those rivals, drew alongside CHOLLIMA on the turn, dueled
into the stretch, put a head in front in upper stretch then drifted out and relinquished the lead mid-stretch and stayed on gamely to the wire. BE LIFTED UP
raced outside a rival, four wide into the lane, angled out in the stretch and outfinished ALL TEA ALL SHADE for the show honors. ALL TEA ALL SHADE
went two to three wide around the turn, angled out in the lane, showed a mild late effort and got edged for the show. YOU WANNA EAR RIP chased two
wide through the turn and lacked a rally. TIM'S STREET GIRL stalked the speed from outside, raced four then three wide around the turn and weakened.
SEA GLASS pressed the pace from inside to the turn, dropped back around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
GIRONA broke in and bumped rival at the start, sped to the front, set the pace under pressure, cleared into stretch and held well under a drive. BACK
BEAUTY tracked from outside, went five wide around the turn, stayed within striking distance to the eighth pole but could not summon the needed late kick.
STAR SUNDAE pressed outside the leader, lost contact and chased four wide into the lane and held the show. SHARONA SUNSET bumped by the winner
at the start, chased along the inside, moved a bit off the rail in the drive and needed to find more. COALINGA HILLS went four wide into the turn, five wide
into the stretch and showed a mild response when called upon. MUSICALLY had early speed between rivals, outpaced leaving the backstretch, drifted out
early on the turn, corrected back to the two path and failed to rally. TAKES A VILLAGE angled to the rail nearing the turn, saved ground into the stretch,
angled out in the furlong grounds and also lacked a rally. SPECTACULAR STORM up close early, went four to five wide around the turn, angled in upper
stretch and faded. DURGA fractious in the gate, raced off the pace, five wide into the turn, six wide entering the drive and had little left. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
DARING CAT bumped by outside rival at the start, stalked off the rail, three wide into the stretch, took over mid-stretch, drew clear at the eighth pole and
inched away. RANGER MOLLY set the pace under pressure, lost command past the three-eighths pole, fought back along the inside in the drive, could not
match the winner late but held the place. SMART LOLA attended the pace three deep, gained the advantage past the three-eighths pole, lost command
mid-stretch, kept to task in the final furlong and was outkicked for second. DISKO FEVER off slow to begin, sent to be involved early and went up between
rivals, chased behind the leader into the turn, lacked room along the inside around the bend and again in upper stretch, angled out at the three-sixteenths
pole and continued willingly to the wire. DONTMESSWITHTESS chased four wide through the turn and weakened. BACKTOFLASH traveled three wide into
the turn, moved into the two path then back out three wide exiting the bend and improved position. BEKELE raced along the inside, angled out upper stretch
and lacked a rally. BEST LADY broke in and bumped rival, went four wide into the lane and never made an impact. NIGHT GAMES saved ground around
the bend then came out entering the stretch and was never a factor. REMEMBER TO BID pressed from outside, lost contact around the turn, angled to the
rail leaving the bend and tired.

Footnotes
PUBILIUS SYRUS broke in and bumped rival, reserved through the early stages, traveled two wide then rallied inside the leaders, drew clear approaching
the eighth pole and kept to task to the wire. CONQUEST COBRA closest in pursuit early, bid outside the leader at the half-mile, traveled two wide into the
far turn then four wide into the stretch, battled in the late stages and got outkicked by the winner. SLY stalked two wide then angled out on the far turn, came
five wide into the stretch and held the show. CAUSEIDIDITMYWAY broke in then sped to the front, set the pace in the two path around the first turn,
challenged from outside at the midway point, held a short lead through the far turn and into the stretch, lost command at the three-sixteenths pole, yielded in
the final furlong and got outfinished for the show honors. BIG HOOF DYNAMITE raced outside a rival while in range, went three then four wide around the
far turn and lacked further response. RACE HOME bumped leaving the gate, raced three wide around the first turn, four wide around the second and never
rallied. HONORING MAJOR tucked inside early, angled out around on the second turn and was always outrun.

GO tossed head and got bumped leaving the gate, unhurried through the early stages, raced three wide around the first turn, angled out into the stretch,
closed widest and could not get by the winner. MARGOT'S BOY showed early speed outside the leader then dropped back to stalk, raced between foes on
the backstretch, four wide leaving the turn, rallied in the final furlong but was outlclosed by the top pair. MYSTERY MAN sped to the front early, lost
command at the five-eighths pole, chased three wide into the stretch, re-bid three deep at the quarter pole and got outkicked in the final furlong.
VANTASTIC stalked in the two path then angled to the inside, saved ground into the lane, bid inside the leader at the quarter pole, took control at the
three-sixteenths marker then flattened out in the late stages. IRISH HEATWAVE up close early and pressed along the inside, gained command and the
five-eighths pole then cleared rival on the backstretch, showed the way into the stretch, challenged from both sides at the quarter pole, lost command at the
three-sixteenths and flattened out. SQUARE DEAL broke out and bumped rival at the start, went three to four wide around the first turn, traveled three deep
up the backstretch, angled into the two path, had nothing left for the stretch run and was eased late and walked off. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
PLAY CHICKEN tracked three wide, moved closer leaving the backstretch, chased three wide into the stretch, took command at the eighth pole and held
the runner-up at bay. MOVING FAST raced five then four wide around the first turn, angled in some nearing the far turn, advanced three to four wide around
that bend, tipped out in the stretch, rallied but could not enough. CLUB CAL traveled along the inside then angled out into the backstretch, went between
runners and moved up to the far turn, ranged up four wide around the final turn and finished well for the show. MISTER BOLD bumped leaving the gate, set
the pace, met bid from the outside, held a short lead through the far turn and into the stretch, lost command at the quarter pole and stayed on well through
the late stages. GOOD WITH PEOPLE up close early outside the leader, bid alongside rival past the half-mile pole, challenged through the far turn, put a
head in front at the quarter pole, relinquished the lead with a furlong to go and flattened in the late stages. TACOFLAVOREDKISSES stalked form inside,
angled out into the stretch and further out in the lane, summoned a mild rally but needed more. FROM THE GET GO broke out and bumped at the start,
raced off the rail, three wide into the stretch, angled out upper and lacked a rally. ASCOT STORM tracked off the inside, steadied at the five-sixteenths pole
and had nothing left for the drive. WEDDING GROOM pulled early, settled inside, steadied on the second turn, stayed inside to the stretch and weakened.
GOVENOR'S PARTY raced four to three wide around the first turn, remained off the rail throughout, came five wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MAMA SUPERIOR chased four wide through the first turn, went up to take command into the backstretch, vied outside a rival to the far turn, led through that
bend then cleared into the stretch then inched away under a drive. SIDEWAYS SUANCES broke out and bumped rival, raced a bit off the rail then moved
out, closed in leaving the backstretch, went four wide around the far turn, in range through the drive but could not summon the needed rally and held the
place. SIMMER DOWN broke out and bumped rival, raced three wide around the first turn, raced in range to the stretch, lacked the necessary late punch
and got outfinished for the place honors. SEE YOU AT THE TOP broke in and bumped twice at the start, raced five wide into the lane and flattened.
FICTIONAL lunged at the start, stalked in the two path through the first turn, went between runners into the backstretch, put in a mild bid between the
leaders entering the far turn, could not keep pace around the bend and flattened out in the late stages. REDEMPTION CODE sandwiched at the start,
tucked inside early, went three to four wide around the second turn and lacked a rally. COPPER WINGS pinballed at the start, raced five wide into the
stretch and never threatened. LADY MO sped clear around the first turn then was rated in hand into the leaving the bend, lost the lead and vied with outside
rival up the backstretch, dropped back inside on the far turn and gave way. BREWED BIG was always outrun. PRINCESS SADIE stumbled and bumped
both sides at the start and trailed throughout.
