and checked back, improved late. A THOUSAND REASONS good speed to the lead, collared at quarter pole and gave in readily. OUTBURST (GB) raced
evenly with no response from the quarter pole. NEW YORK GROOVE was off tardy and never factored. KRUNCH wasthrough after half, dropped back.

KING THEO staggered from gate, regrouped quickly with a steady run past the quarter pole to prevail. PERUVIAN BOY had a troubled trip from the start,
ralllied on wrong lead the entire stretch run and just missed in a game effort. KIERKEGAARD stalked leader to the stretch, hooked in a three way battle but
outfinished late. EQUAL JUSTICE just off leaders to the turn, blocked in the stretch with no kick when clear. UPHAM never far back to turn, improved
position late. HUG THE MUNNY good position to the stretch, roused with nothing left in the drive. THAT QUALITY speed to deep stretch, gave way final
sixteenth. CLEAR TO CLOSE never a menace. MUTAFAANY had a steady fade.HEAD ON VIDEO NOT PROVIDED
