APPOLINA set a well rated pace from the start, drew off in upper stretch and was kept to task in the end. FLEETA BELLE was stalking the pace while
saving ground on the turn then rallied along the inside in the stretch and was up for the place. WHEW was unhurried early then rallied and swung out to be
five wide in upper stretch and was gaining ground but was no menace. RAILROAD ROSIE chased the early pace while inside, made a bid in the stretch but
came up empty in late stretch. AMERICA'S DARLING stalked the pace while three wide into the turn and was no menace. MADISON'S QUARTERS chased
the early pace while two wide into the turn then faltered.
