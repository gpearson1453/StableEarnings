Footnotes
MY MAN ELVIS pressed the pace in the early stages, took over on the backside, shook free entering the far turn, dueled with BOSTON LIGHT turning for
home, battled back gamely inside of that rival past midstretch and prevailed determinedly. BOSTON LIGHT tracked along the inside, then two wide, bid two
wide on the far turn, dueled into the lane, put a head in front and then dug in gamely outside to the finish. SACRIFICING IT ALL stalked two wide, chased on
the far turn, came three wide into the lane and finished evenly. YONDERING was steadied at the start, raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn and
weakened. MANAGING RISK raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane and had no rally. PROUD AND FURIOUS raced a bit erratically while
pulling in the early stages, steadied, then outrun. BILL'S MAFIA set the pace on the inside, then chased and faded.

Footnotes
THREE POTATOE FOUR, just off rail, split rivals on the turn, moved back to the rail early stretch, split foes again mid stretch and got the nod. CLEVER
START set the pace in five path, was clear on the turn and through deep stretch but just failed. HEY DEWZPOTS, bumped leaving gate, moved up four path
and rallied too late. RISQUE'S JEWEL broke slowly then raced wide. OUR DIXIE BLUE, wide in closest pursuit, was eased up in final strides and was
nipped for fourth place monies. VISITING ANGEL, wide and just off the pace, tired. ELEGANTDREAM stumbled then came in and bumped HEY
DEWZPOSTS leaving the gate then was no factor. CORBALLY saved ground and stopped. TUDOX RUE MAJESTIC injured herself in the starting gate and
was ordered scratched on the advice of the veterinarian. A consolation daily double was paid, all other wagers on her were refunded.

Footnotes
SPLITZVILLE was bumped and off slowly, chased the pace, bid four wide at the quarter pole, rallied to a short lead, then dug in gamely to prevail. DON'T
RECALL raced off the pace between rivals, advanced midway on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch run and dug in gamely late to earn the place spot.
CHUB ON DA RUN raced close up on the inside, chased on the turn, bid at the quarter pole, was in tight between rivals entering the stretch, angled out for
a clear run, rallied and got third. GHOST FIGHTER raced off the pace inside, advanced on the turn, steadied behind rivals at the top of the lane, then rallied
between horses. STAR LUCK set the pace, showed the way on the turn, drifted out at the quarter pole in front of CHUBON DA RUN and weakened in the
lane. FRAY was bumped at the start, stalked outside, chased on the turn, lacked a bid and weakened. LYNARD was bumped at the start and steadied,
chased inside and tired. REBEL TRAVELLER raced off the pace between rivals and failed to threaten. CASPER JOE chased outside and faded. OUR
UNCLE DREW raced four wide and gave way. EXPENSIVE bobbled at the break, raced five wide and gave way. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of CHUB

Footnotes
JAYJAYDEE stalked two wide, took the lead leaving final turn and drew off fully extended. HAPPYASCANB, just off the rail, moved out entering the stretch
and was no match. CITY GUY set the pace along the rail then tired. AFLEET MELODY raced wide and gave way. DRUMMOND, three wide and just off the
pace, tired. INDIRECTLY, in the four path, was never a serious threat. HOSTILE WITNESS was just off the rail and never threatened. MIRROR MIRROR
came out at the start and bumped COMMISSIONER DAVE, saved ground under rating then tired. COMMISSIONER DAVE, bumped leaving the gate,
showed nothing. BETTS raced wide and failed to menace.
