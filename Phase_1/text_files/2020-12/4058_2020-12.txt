SHALL WE DANCE raced well back off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily gained three wide on the far turn, then dug in under
vigorous encouragement to get up the final yards. WEEKEND MADNESS settled off the pace while saving ground, started a bid past the seven sixteenths
pole, raced at a close disadvantage near the rail, though took a slim lead toward the head of the lane, drew clear past the eighth pole but was caught in the
final yards. DON'T FIGHT settled off the pace about the four path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead into the far turn, but drifted and
lost the lead toward the head of the lane and flattened stride. JET SETTIN LADY saved early ground well off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
improved her position in the three path of the far turn but showed little in the lane. JEAN GREY stalked the earlier pace inside then eased out into the
backstretch and showed little response. IRISH FIX took a slim lead three wide at the mile marker and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under
pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was caught past the quarter pole and weakened at the rail on the turn. SUNFLOWER ROSE stalked the early pace
two deep while between horses then settled close from the three quarter pole, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths but faded leaving the three
eighths pole.

far turn, then dug in under steady insistence to hold on well. SCOTTISH MAN saved ground off the pace the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole
and improved at the rail on the far turn, angled three wide into the stretch and dug in to take second mid-stretch, while gaining on the winner. ABSALOM
stalked the pace from the three path, challenged approaching the five sixteenths pole but dropped back through the far turn and flattened stride inside the
eighth pole. CHARITABLE VISIT eased out through the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn in the four path and entered the stretch outside, then passed a rival. FEISTY AND SASSY saved early ground and bid mildly from the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then weakened. CLASSY CROSSING raced off the early pace in the two and three paths then showed little

BAYOU BOUGIE took over nearing the half mile pole and rated the pace, came under pressure into the turn and raced at the rail through the turn then held
well under steady hand urging. CARSON CASTLE chased the pace, rounded the turn off the rail and dug in through the stretch, though, had to settle for
second. TUITION PLAN steadied on the chute then picked up the chase outside down the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, came
between horses mid-stretch and dueled for third. OUR BAD GIRL chased the early pace outside, rounded the turn four wide and was outfinished in the duel
for third. MISS GRANDSTANDER gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened stride later yards. LETTS GO TO DIXIES broke outward
and gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the five path and finished evenly. MARY'S LISTED NEXT chased the pace, raced off the rail on the turn
then weakened. LIL LINDER was not a factor.

Footnotes
ALL ABOUT TAP rated a short lead inside, dug in to the challenge of YESIKNOWWHOIAM from the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the
rail on the far turn, drew clear inside the eighth pole, lugged inward in the upper stretch and held on under steady encouragement, while the latter, stalked
the pace two deep and challenged from the seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage through the far turn, dropped back past the eighth
pole but dug in to retain second. MAN OF THE NIGHT settled off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path, angled inside the winner past the eighth pole but steadied off that one's heels in the upper stretch and was
outfinished in the later duel for second. ITSAHATTATACK broke a bit awkwardly and raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, then weakened. GHOST MINE saved ground off the pace then picked up the chase toward the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn close to the rail but drifted outward nearing the head of the lane and showed little further. COCKY WINCHILL settled
in the three path the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, but showed little response. COBAN entered the first turn about the five path then angled
to the rail midway through the turn and never factored. LIL SILVER FOX was not a factor. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of All
About Tap, lodged by the rider of Man Of The Night, for interference in the upper stretch, but took no action.

MY TIME IN COURT pressured the pace and took the nod toward the quarter pole, contested the advantage two deep on the turn, dug in determinedly to
put Majestic Seas away and raced clear under the wire. ROCKET APPEAL broke a bit awkwardly then picked up the chase off the rail, angled in nearing the
turn and raced off the rail through the turn, angled four wide into the lane and dug in to take second the final strides. COMMAND THE CAT chased the pace
off the rail, drifted to the five path on the turn and finished well to take third the final strides. MAJESTIC SEAS set a pressured pace inside, was headed
nearing the quarter pole, raced close at the rail on the turn and dueled gamely through the upper stretch before flattening stride. SHAMELESS RISK chased
the pace through the backstretch, was carried five wide on the turn, raced outside into the lane and could only close the gap. SCYTHE chased the pace
inside, checked at the rail past the five sixteenths pole, but ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. ORACLE OF OMAHA gave chase and rounded
the turn about the four path. BLAME IT ON HONEY gave chase outside then flattened stride about the five path of the turn.

Footnotes
ESTHER'S FORTUNE raced through the opening turn about the five path and was well off the pace leaving the turn, started a bid toward the seven
sixteenths pole, steadily progressed to take the lead in the five path toward the head of the lane, then drew off under steady encouragement. RAELYN'S
STAR raced off the pace in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and appeared a close factor three wide
midway on the far turn, but proved no match in the stretch and settled for second. DYNACASTLE settled off the pace inside, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, eased to the four path leaving the far turn and dug in to take third later yards. REVOLVING LOVE took the lead three wide approaching the
first turn then angled to the rail to rate the pace, was met at the seven sixteenths pole and came under pressure toward the five sixteenths, contested the
edge nearest the rail on the far turn but was caught toward the head of the lane and weakened inside the eighth pole. PAINT IT GREEN stalked the earlier
pace about the three path, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep most of the far turn but dropped back
past the eighth pole and weakened. ECLIPTICALS VISKI stalked the pace inside, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, raced at the rail on the far
turn then weakened. WHIZ PASS raced well off the pace about the three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. SHE'S
RIGHT rounded the opening turn about the five path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path of the far turn.
RUNNING PRAYERS showed little response while mostly saving ground. SINGINGINSTILETTOS was slow into stride and raced well back in the six path
the first turn.
