left handed urging and just lasted. COLORINCOLONEL allowed to settle, rallied determinedly three wide through the stretch and just missed getting up in
time. COSI MOMOSI stalked the pace into the far turn, split horses two wide nearing the quarter pole, prompted the balance of the pace, was in tight
nearing the wire and outfinished. STAGE FIVE CREEPER moved up three wide nearing the far turn then came up empty. WEDDING DAY KITTEN failed to
menace. RACINROSEMARY made the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside into the far turn then gradually weakened. PEGGY'S COVE

Footnotes
GRAY ROYALITY delayed the start while reluctant to load, steadied inside of a rival at the nine sixteenths pole, dropped inside on the turn, angled out to the
four path entering the stretch, rallied under strong urging and was along in time. STAR OF SHANGHAI trailed into the stretch, swung wide and closed fast.
MY DAMS ATITUDE stalked the pace and finished with good courage in the eight path. CEVICHE had a mild late rally in the four path. BIG WIN chased the
pace along the inside and faded in the stretch. LADY UNBRIDLED passed tiring rivals. TIZ INDEPENDENCE settled mid pack and lacked the needed
response. GO ESTRELLA broke in front, set the pace in the two path until deep stretch then gave way. AMARI S. failed to menace. GEMMAKER angled in
at the nine sixteenths pole, chased the pace into the turn then faltered.
