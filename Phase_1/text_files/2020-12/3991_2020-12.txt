Footnotes
LINCOLN COUNTY KID was void of any early speed, advanced from between rivals, was closing late and was up in time for the win. FRED was not far
back early, went four wide, angled out and finished second best. WHISKEY LAUGH CAT raced in mid pack, went eight wide and offered a mild rally.
ANXIOUS INDIAN was taken back early, went three wide and flattened out. BRIGHT WAY pressed the early pace from between rivals and weakened.
DIABOLICAL MIGHT tracked the early pace, went six wide into the turn and was empty late. FARMER FRED R F was outrun early from the inside and
never fired. KEY TO THE CITY forced the early pace from between rivals and faded. JOHNNY'S BANDIT set a pressured early pace from off the rail and
weakened. EL MAFIA was allowed to settle and was no threat. AMORCITO CORAZON was reserved early and was no factor.
