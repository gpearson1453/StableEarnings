Footnotes
KARAKATSIE was tugging along between rivals while racing in range two and three wide, angled further out nearing the quarter pole, closed outside under
hand urging, seized command leaving the eighth pole, switched back to the left lead near the sixteenth marker and outfinished the runner-up while trying to
lug in. QUEEN OF THE GREEN raced four wide in midpack around the first turn, advanced three deep rounding the far turn, bid between foes in midstretch
and finished willingly while outkicked inside of the winner late. UPTOWN FLIRT settled off the pace along the inside, went three wide around the far turn and
had a mild rally to gain the show late. PANGAEA PROXIMA set the pace along the rail to midstretch and weakened. PARTISAN KITTEN was not a threat
while racing three wide. TIME SENSITIVE tracked the pace three wide around the first turn, remained up close two wide around the far turn, and faded in
the drive. DANCE WITH DESTINY was bumped at the start, raced well back two wide, went four wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. MAP EM UP
saved ground in range, was shuffled back around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and lacked a closing bid. CARIBE BEAN MOKA broke out and
bumped DANCE WITH DESTINY at the start, pressed the pace two wide and was through after a half. SILKY WARRIOR (IRE) was sluggish at the start,
saved ground well back, went four wide around he the far turn and made little impact. FOXTROT SEVILLE was outrun while racing two and three wide.
TALK DIRTY was in tight at the start then trailed inside.

Footnotes
DESCENTE pressed the pace from the outset, bid between horses in the two-path midway on the turn, took over outside LIZA STAR after six furlongs, and
drew clear under a steady drive. DON'T GET KHOZY was outrun early inside, moved out in upper stretch and rallied willingly to get up for second. SKY
CHASER broke out bumping CHARGE ACCOUNT, raced in range three then four wide to the stretch, and was outfinished for second. CHARGE ACCOUNT
got bumped by SKY CHASER at the start, advanced in the two-path after six furlongs, then flattened out. LIZA STAR set a pressured early pace inside,
yielded to the winner approaching the quarter-pole, and gave way. DANA GRACE was no factor inside. BARGAINAIRE pressed the pace three wide, and
weakened near the end of the turn. VICTORY CRUSADE shifted out four wide around the turn, and was through into the lane. CHUBOFFTHEOLDBLOCK
was four wide into the turn, and could not keep up. SLINGIN SAMMY B backed off early four wide, and had nothing left on the turn.

start, raced three wide off the pace and finished with interest. SWEET YARE N DIRA raced well back two wide, swung out in upper stretch and rallied
belatedly down the center of the track. MY SARASOTA STAR was bumped at the start, set the pace along the rail and weakened in the final sixteenth.
CAT'S ASTRAY prompted the pace two wide and tired in the final furlong. PRECOCIOUS PEACH broke through the starting gate prior to the start, raced

Footnotes
JESUS' TEAM saved ground early in easy striking range, moved to the two-path getting roused to go after STORM RUNNER after six furlongs, idled being
scrubbed along turning for home, stayed on task getting brushed lightly past the eighth-pole, and forged past all out. STORM RUNNER grabbed the lead
with an alert beginning, rated along clear to the end of the far turn, dug in when challenged through the furlong grounds, drifted out and lightly brushed
JESUS' TEAM before getting pulled off that foe, and stayed on tenaciously. DACK JANIEL'S was never far back, took closer order lodging a three-wide bid
outside the leaders with five-sixteenths remaining, stayed on to mid stretch and was outfinished while clear of the rest. TREASURE TROVE brushed with
PRINCE OF ARABIA after the start, raced well back for six furlongs, came four wide off the far turn brushing lightly with TOUGHEST 'OMBRE, and
improved position without threatening. PRINCE OF ARABIA brushed with TREASURE TROVE after the start, put in a mild run in the two-path turning for
home, but flattened out. TOUGHEST 'OMBRE raced four to three wide in midpack, brushed lightly with TREASURE TROVE at the head of the stretch, and
tired. REBELDE moved in from the three-path around the first turn, worked over to the inside up the backstretch, and failed to menace. LEITONE (CHI)
prompted the pace outside, and faltered approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
HIGH NOON RIDER was bumped soon after the start, angled in to save some ground off the pace early on the first turn, raced at the rail around much of
the far turn, began angling out late on the turn, moved into the five path in upper stretch, closed strongly and was up late. TEMPLE was bumped nearing the
first turn, saved ground around that bend, advanced three wide around the far turn, took the lead leaving the eighth pole, led to deep stretch and held for a
share of second. MUGGSAMATIC raced off the pace two wide, went three wide around the far turn, angled widest in upper stretch and rallied outside.
ARTIE'S RUMOR steadied soon after the start, raced well back two wide, angled out in upper stretch, rallied between foes and lacked room through the
final sixteenth. HIEROGLYPHICS pressed the pace two wide, briefly led in midstretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. OVER THE CHANNEL bumped
the winner after the start, prompted the pace three wide, was hard held while pulling down the backstretch, continued three wide around the far turn, bid
nearing the eighth pole and was outkicked. RIJEKA (IRE) saved ground well back, went two wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly. TUSK set the
pace along the rail and tired in the lane. APRECIADO was bumped entering the first turn, saved ground in range and faded. SPEED FRANCO was bumped
entering the first turn, chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. KING OF SPADES was outrun inside. ZIPPY chased the pace four wide and
retreated around the far turn. THE RIDER OF ARTIE'S RUMOR CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH BUT THE STEWARDS FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
AVANT GARDE advanced inside after six furlongs, bid along the rail through the furlong grounds, stayed on his left lead and got up in the last 50 yards.
TOWN CLASSIC was unhurried for a half-mile, bid four wide turning for home, reached the front a furlong out, but was edged out in the closing stages.
LOOKIN AT ROSES was outrun early, swung five wide approaching the stretch, finished willingly and was up for the show. YODEL E. A. WHO pursued FIX
ME A SANDWICH from outside early, took over five-sixteenths out, got collared from outside by TOWN CLASSIC coming to the eighth-pole, and gave way.
JOE DI BAGGIO loomed a threat three wide a quarter-mile out, but lacked the needed final response. CREA'S BKLYN LAW lagged well back for a half-mile,
shifted out five wide to the lane, and passed tired horses. MILES AHEAD stayed close early inside, was roused late on the turn while moving out three wide,
and came up empty. T LOVES A FIGHT gained mildly inside to upper stretch, then shortened stride on his left lead. ALL AROUND was always outrun. I'M A
G SIX raced three to four wide, and tired after a half. EXAMINER raced forwardly up the backstretch, but had nothing left approaching the stretch. FIX ME A
SANDWICH set the early pace inside, yielded around the turn, drifted out and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
QUEENS EMBRACE settled off the early pace along the rail, advanced four wide around the far turn, reeled in the leader near the sixteenth pole and burst
clear under a drive. SUGAR FIX raced in range three wide through the opening half, made a quick move to the front early on the far turn, drew clear nearing
the lane, led to the sixteenth pole but had no answer for the winner late. BIENVILLE STREET saved ground in midpack, went three wide between foes
around the far turn, moved into third nearing the eighth pole, swerved out in deep stretch and was taken in hand to keep straight through the late stages.
IRONY OF REALITY broke awkwardly, lacked early speed while racing two wide, circled five wide around the far turn, stayed on evenly through the lane
and was forced out late. JOST SAYIN saved ground well back, advanced two and three wide around the far turn and passed tiring rivals in the lane. ROSA
STAR stalked the pace three wide around the first turn, bid two wide nearing the far turn, briefly led near the three-eighths pole and tired in the lane.
JABUTICABA stalked the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. AFFICIONADO (FR) was in range inside and faded two wide around the far turn.
ISADORABLE AIDA failed to menace while racing two and three wide. MARIES MELODY set the pace along the rail and stopped around the far turn.

Footnotes
FIYA hustled to the front after the start, rated along inside to the stretch, kept FULLY LOADED at bay with the rider sitting chilly and taking a peek back a
furlong out, and remained firmly in command under confident handling. FULLY LOADED pursued FIYA from outside from the outset, could not make an
impression under a drive at the head of the lane, and ran on willingly to secure the place. HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE was never far back while two then three
wide to the stretch, and ran on one-paced. TIGER BLOOD saved ground outsprinted for three furlongs, moved out and improved position late between
horses while never a threat. LEGENDARY PRINCE had an inside trip, and made no headway through the stretch under pressure. CITRUS BURST bumped
with FULLY LOADED at the start, raced two wide outrun to the stretch, and improved past tired horses. BELGRANO moved off the inside leaving the turn,
and lacked the needed response. UNMOORED was two wide on the turn, moved out in the lane and could not gain. LUSITANO was outrun inside.
MEMORABLE broke slowly and showed little. MUNN PASSAGE raced three wide and never got close. LIKE WHAT I SEE raced three to four wide, and
faded steadily after three-eighths of a mile.

Footnotes
FROST OR FRIPPERY was shut off and forced to check entering the first turn, raced two wide in midpack for a half, was shuffled back while still two wide
around the far turn, angled six wide in upper stretch, closed outside, took the lead with about seventy yards to go and just lasted. BOBBY G saved ground
well off the pace, went two wide between rivals around the far turn, swung to the extreme outside in upper stretch, closed with a rush and just missed. DEAL
DRIVEN stalked the pace two wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, led to deep stretch and yielded. O'KRAM was devoid of speed, circled five
wide around the far turn, loomed boldly in upper stretch and flattened out a bit in the final furlong. BUSINESS CYCLE raced in range two wide, dropped
back under some urging around the turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch, re-bid inside of foes but was outkicked. CHARLIE THE GREEK was strung out
four wide around the first turn, advanced outside down the backstretch, made a three wide bid around the far turn, vied between foes to midstretch and
weakened. SOUPER FLY OVER was bumped at the start, raced four wide around the first turn, moved four deep into contention around the far turn, battled
on between foes to midstretch and was outfinished. QUENANE failed to menace while racing four wide. BOLD PAYNTER raced off the pace three wide,
steadied near the seven-sixteenths marker and never threatened. SNAP HOOK chased the pace three wide and faded after a half. MEADE was bumped at
the start and made little impact while racing two wide. INCUBATOR set the pace along the rail and stopped.
