Footnotes
RUM BOBBY stalked the pace along the inside racing down the backstretch, moved up three wide between rivals nearing the quarter pole to challenge for
the lead, raced four wide nearing the eighth marker and held gamely to the wire under strong encouragement. GOTTAWAY stalked the early going, moved
up five wide past the quarter pole, dug in nearing the sixteenth pole but couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish second best. STAND MY
GROUND was unhurried early on, saved ground throughout, awaited room into the lane and showed good late interest. CHAMPAGNE'S ON ICE set all the
pace from the inside and weakened along the inside through the drive. EL ROJO dropped back early, raced three deep through the lane and failed to have a
response. ROCKIN RON stumbled at the break, settled off the early pace, raced five wide through the stretch and never was a factor. EXCHANGE FEVER
pressed the early leader and faded the final quarter of a mile.

ZABRACADABRA stalked early on, raced four wide around the first turn, moved up four wide nearing the quarter pole and finished well late to get up under
strong encouragement. GENTLEMAN JOE showed good early speed to sett all the pace along the inside down the backstretch, raced off the inside through
the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. CROUCHELLI was slow in the early stages, made a rail bid through the drive but had not enough. SEA GHOST
tracked the leader while racing two wide and weakened. SOCIETY'S TIGER was off a step slow, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a
factor.

while racing between rivals and tired. POLISH COOKIE stalked the pace, saved ground and had no response in the drive. BELLA COOLA dropped back

Footnotes
LUCRE was allowed to settle early on, raced towards the inside through the far turn, moved up five wide through the lane and finished well to be well clear
late under steady handling. SAND IN MY SHOES pressed the early pace, raced two wide and was no match for the winner in the drive. GRACE N FAVOR
vied for the early lead along the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. AWESOME BUTTERFLY stalked the pace, raced towards the inside and
had
no
response.
ALYS
GREAT
NOTION
settled
off
the
early
pace,
raced
four
wide
into
the
upper
stretch
and
never
was
a
factor.
NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE was slow early on, raced six wide into the upper lane and never threatened. CAPRICHOSA stalked the pace along the inside,
angled four wide through the lane and failed to respond. ALEXA G was slow early and trailed throughout.
