Footnotes
THE CRITICAL WAY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off under mild urging. FOX ROX
allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and closed well for the place. SIMMARDSTRIKE mid pack,
saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and evened out the final furlong. ARCADIA CALLS rated back, angled out
through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and got up for a share. RAOFTHESUN mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch and ran evenly. THE CONNECTOR mid pack, held position three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and weakened in
the drive. SOLITARY JACK tracked the pace, angled out into the turn to moved to position, bid outside the leader into the lane and had no stretch rally.
DISCO DEANO was a brief factor.
