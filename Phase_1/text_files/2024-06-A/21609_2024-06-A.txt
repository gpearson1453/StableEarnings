Footnotes
ATLANTIC STRIKE stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path around the turn, ranged up to bid entering the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch
and drew off through the final furlong. LITTLE BLAZE prompted outside of the leader after a quarter mile, vied in the three path around the turn, led narrowly
as an outer bidder joined the fray entering the lane, proved no match for that one in upper stretch, then secured place in the late stages. SUMMER OF
MISCHIEF was hustled forward to set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer prompter around the turn, got headed by that one and a wider bidder
entering the lane, then yielded yet lasted for show at the wire. SHIP IT pursued from the three path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and ran on
evenly to miss show at the wire. SWEET AMY broke slowly, raced off of the pace in the four path and failed to factor. RACEDAY ATTIRE tracked along the
inside, chased turning for home and failed to menace. HONEY RUN broke slowly, quickly became detached from the rest of the group in the early stages,
lagged behind before being eased and maneuvered to the outside part of the track entering the lane, and was outrun.

Footnotes
LOUISIANA JESS took light contact from an outer rival shortly after the start, prompted along the inside before stalking from the pocket around the turn,
searched for racing room shifting out entering the lane, yet tipped in to split foes two wide in upper stretch, took aim inside of the leader in the final furlong,
inched closer in the final sixteenth and edged past late. THE TONER prompted three deep before vying with only a single inner rival into the turn, remained
in the three path while forging an advantage around the bend, inched clear in upper stretch, held sway into the final sixteenth but was worn down by an
inner challenge in the closing stages. MUSIC MAN stalked in the four path, came under urging turning for home, then chased the top pair willingly through
the final furlong and was best of the rest. DBOOK chased while off of the pace along the inside around the turn, the improved between horse slate.
PROBATIONER bumped an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the four path, moved up late and missed fourth. SWEET MO B bumped an outer
rival at the start before brushing an inner rival in the aftermath, vied two wide and between horses before clearing his inner counterpart entering the turn, got
headed by his outer co-leader turning for home, then gave way leaving upper stretch. MIKA hopped slightly and broke a step slow, chased from midpack in
the three path, drifted out to the five to six path in upper stretch, then hung on his left lead and tired. PIERCE ELEVATED was pinched back between horses
at the start, lagged behind around the turn and got outrun.

Footnotes
SPURRIER broke well and prompted along the inside before backing off to stalk approaching the turn, pursued from the two path around the bend, tipped
outside of the top pair and to the four path entering the lane, ranged up in the final furlong, drove past at the sixteenth pole and inched clear. LEND IT
TEWMEY broke a bit outwardly, stalked five deep while inching closer outside of rivals, pressed in the four path into the turn, bid outside of the leader
tucking to the three path at the three furlong pole, forged an advantage turning for home, inched a subtly clear margin in upper stretch as an outer rival
loomed a danger, but was bested by that one with a sixteenth to go and held place. FLASH OF GENIUS advanced to the front after a furlong, showed the
way inside of an outer bidder entering the turn, got headed by that one nearing the five sixteenths pole, yet kept on through the lane and held show late.
NATORADE trailed in the three path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and stayed on willingly. CAMPTON saved ground off of the pace and ran on
mildly. LEAD FOOT lacked speed along the inside, shifted out from the four path to the six path in upper stretch and failed to factor. KING ME tracked three
to two wide, got roused to the four path at the three furlong pole, lacked a bid and faded. DON'T STOP chased forwardly four to three wide and between
horses, shifted to the five path pursuing at the three furlong pole and weakened between horses.

Footnotes
VIGGIEDAL showed the way along the inside around the turn, kicked away in upper stretch and drew off under hand urging. KIMCHI CAT eased back at the
half mile pole allowing an outer rival to set the pace, stalked along the inside around the turn, claimed place from an outer rival while taking aim outside of
the clearing leader in upper stretch, but was no match and second best. SOMETHINABOUTHER broke outwardly, tracked inching closer tucking to the four
path approaching the turn, but bore wide entering the bend, recovered to tuck to the four path while trailing turning for home, shifted back to the five path
entering the lane, then stayed on well to reach show late. LUCKY MAMA applied mild outside of the leader into the turn, but gave way after getting floated
three wide into upper stretch and lost show late. AURELIA'S MISCHIEF steadied while getting shuffled back briefly at the half mile pole, chased from the
two to three path around the bend and tired. DERRY GIRL raced off of the pace in the three path and failed to factor.

Footnotes
RELAMPAGO VERDE stalked along the inside, awaited racing room behind the leading trio nearing the lane, tipped outside of them entering it, flopped
back to his left lead while ranging up to the leader at the furlong grounds, sustained a bid and inched past in the closing stages. MY BOY TONY tracked two
wide, tipped to the three path entering the backstretch, ranged up to bid three deep entering the lane, struck the front in upper stretch, dug in to meet an
outer challenge in the final furlong but was bested late. HAWKS CREEK rated at the rear along the inside, advanced two wide and between horses around
the final furlong, then ran on to claim show with a sixteenth to go. EL MATADOR bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked outside of the leader, bid into the
final turn, vied as an outer rival joined the fray entering the lane, but was outkicked by that one entering upper stretch and yielded. MIKEALICIOUS lacked
speed in the two path early on, pulled strongly between horses and steadied hard among foes approaching the wire for the first time, pursued in the three
path and between horses around the second turn, was roused to the four path around the final bend and failed to menace. NUMERO DIX (GB) broke slowly,
raced at the rear in the two to three path, advanced in the four path approaching the wire for the first time, got hung four wide around the second turn, trailed
tucking to the two path around the final turn and improved between horses. SGT. PEPPER pursued from midpack two wide, steadied off heels with a mile to
go, took the second turn in the three path, came under urging around the final bend and faded. NOW AND LATER was bumped between horses at the start,
laid off of the pace along the inside, checked inside of troubled rivals approaching the wire for the first time, shifted out around the far turn and failed to
factor. MAXIMUM CAPACITY showed the way uncontested early on, felt pressure from an outer rival down the backstretch, vied with that bidder around the
final turn, but was headed by that one and a wider challenger entering teh lane and readily faltered. VIVA LA RED bumped an outer rival at the start, saved
ground in midpack and faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
DREAMGIRL pressed outside of the leader, bid entering the lane, sparred neck-and-neck through midstretch and inched clear in the final sixteenth.
PRAYING showed the way as an outer rival applied pressure into the turn, dug into resist that one's bid entering the lane, dueled hanging on her left lead
and was bested late. TROUBLER tracked along the inside, pursued from the two to three path around the turn, vied for show with an outer rival while
chasing the embattled leading pair through the final furlong, then lasted late and clung to that position. ONE HAPPY ISLAND chased forwardly in the three
to four path, vied for show with an inner rival through the lane and missed that position between horses at the wire. SPUN CANDY raced off of the pace in
the five path, then stayed on outside of foes while hanging on her left lead and missed show at the wire. FLIP FLOPS lacked speed in the three path and
stayed on mildly between horses in the final furlong. STELLAR ASSET chased from just a bit off of the fence and failed to menace. BOUTWELL TIME broke
a step slow, raced at the rear two wide and between horses and made little impact. TOODLE LOO broke a step slow, leaned inwardly and was last away,

Footnotes
MONEY RUN transferred light contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the start, set the pace inside of a sternly pressing rival around the turn, shook
free of that one in upper stretch and drew off. INFILTRATOR leaned in and brushed a rival at the start, lacked speed in the two path, stayed on shifting a
touch out in midstretch and sustained progress to edge place in the closing stages. AWESOME AARON prompted outside of the pace setter and eventual
winner around the turn, but proved no match for that one in upper stretch, yielded and lost place late. SOLIDIFY took an awkward stride and brushed the
inner railing at the eleven sixteenths pole, trailed along the inside, then ran on willingly for a minor share. GO WEST pursued from midpack in the three path,
floated out to the five path in upper stretch and gave way. ON YOUR MARK took a brush from an outer rival at the start, stalked closest to the top pair in the
two path into the turn, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch but weakened between horses.

Footnotes
JUST MIGHT brushed an inner rival while shifting in after the start, set a clear pace in the two path around the turn and held from pursuers late.
AMBIVALENT pursued from midpack in the two path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, rallied to gain place at the sixteenth pole and held from an
outer late rival. FRONT RUN THE FED laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the four path in upper stretch before tipping to the six to seven path in
the final furlong, and offered a belated kick to miss place. REMUDA was brushed by an outer rival as that one shifted across his path soon after the start,
tracked in the four path, gained place straightening for home, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the sixteenth pole and yielded. ANTARES stalked in the
three path, chased between horses turning for home and gave way. LET MY PEOPLE GO tracked along the inside, chased entering the lane and faded.
CONFIDENCE GAME lacked speed in the three path and made little impact. CONDEMN broke out at the start, trailed along the inside and got outrun.

Footnotes
LIL TOWN SIS stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leaders and to the five path entering upper stretch, sustained slow progress to bid passing the
sixteenth pole and forged a narrow advantage at the wire. CUMBERLAND FALLS stalked in the four path, bid three deep turning for home, led into upper
stretch, shifted out to meet an outer challenge at the sixteenth pole but got nailed at the wire. CORKAGE FEE broke in and bumped a rival at the start,
pressed outside of the leader, bid along with an outer rival turning for home, but was outkicked entering upper stretch and kept on. TRES CHIC (ARG)
pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted out while chasing in upper stretch and pursued evenly. TRANSPARENCY set the pace in the two path, got
headed by a pair of outer rivals at the five sixteenths pole and faded. UNSTABLE PRINCESS transferred contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the
start, pursued from midpack four wide, shifted to the six path into upper stretch and failed to menace between horses. MO SENSE broke a step slow, trailed
in the three path, swung to the seven path entering the lane and moved up. SHE'S MAGIC saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. CRYSTAL
SYMPHONY was bumped by an outer rival and put to crowded quarters between horses at the start, lacked speed in the three to four path and made little
impact. I GOTTA BOLT pursued from the three path and between horses, faded around the turn, checked among foes entering the lane and was not
persisted with thereafter.
