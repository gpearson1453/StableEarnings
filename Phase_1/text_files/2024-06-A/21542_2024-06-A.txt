Footnotes
TAPIT'S DIRECTION raced off the early going, made a four wide move through the far turn and finished well to edge away later under strong handling.
GOLDEN SOMBRERO was bumped, in a bit tight at the start, cleared off to an early lead just off the inside down the backstretch, collared inside the eighth
pole, dug in a game effort to narrowly hold the place position. IM STILL BRAVE prompt the early pace between rivals and kept on through the stretch drive
racing three deep in willing effort. BREATH DEEPLY was forwardly placed from the outside of rivals early on, raced three wide near the quarter pole and
weakened a bit through the drive. GINGERSNAP JACK dropped back early on, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no response.
UZZIAH stalked the pace along the inside and tired. HOLLYWOOD HERO was forced to check between soon after the start, trailed early on and never was
a factor. JADES JAY took up sharply at the start, lost ground to race far back and was outrun.

Footnotes
MISPRINT showed good early foot to set the early pace and drew off through the stretch run under a steady hand ride. SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL tracked the top
pair early on, had an inside run, kept on but was no match for the winner. RED HOT SPARK stalked the pace racing between rivals down the backstretch
through the far turn and had not enough in the drive racing four deep. MUSICAL JOURNEY dropped back near the back of the pack in the early going,
raced four wide into the upper stretch, shifted in through the drive and moved up to improve position. OUR FORTUNE COOKIE pressed two deep from the
outside of rival and weakened through the drive. CAJUN EXPECTATION raced in a bit tight at the break, raced four wide around the far turn and weakened
in the drive. POLA OF TROUBLE trailed early, angled in down the backstretch, was near the rail past the quarter pole and lacked a bid. COZYS PALACE

Footnotes
PRACTICALLY DARK stalked the pace three deep from the outside, asked through the far turn to challenge Zack's Mysterio and finished strongly to edge
clear under steady pressure. ZACK'S MYSTERIO showed good early foot along the inside but was no match for the winner through the drive. FATTOUSH
settled back early, ridden into the far turn, raced two wide near the quarter pole, shifted out four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough for the top
pair. FIVEEYESONSKYSTARS prompt the early leader two deep and weakened through the drive. BLAZE OF COLOR was bumped at the start, trailed
early on, swung six wide into the lane and never threatened.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GLIDER tracked the top pair down the backstretch, raced two wide near the quarter pole, shifted out five wide into the upper stretch and finished
well to draw clear under steady pressure. SANTOS TO WILSON pressed the early leader from the outside and was no match for the winner in the final
stages. THE SKIPPER TOO dropped back near the back early on, raced from the inside past the quarter pole, angled out and moved up late to improve
position. SCAR was bumped soundly at the start, settled off the pace setters, raced three wide near the quarter pole and was even in the drive with no
closing run. LIGHTNING TONES trailed early on, raced near the inside around the far turn, angled out through the upper stretch to race from the far outside
and never was a serious threat. EL ROJO VIVO broke to the outside, bumped rival, set an early pressured pace and weakened the final eighth of a mile.
HABERDASHERY raced mid pack early on, was four deep around the far turn and had no response. SECRET LOVER failed to respond.

Footnotes
QUIMICHIS raced at the back of the pack early on, hard ridden from the outside of foes around the far turn, fanned five wide into the upper stretch and
finished well to draw clear under steady pressure. TRUMPETS pressed the early leader two deep from the outside, dug in between and held the place
position. DEFLECTION was bumped both sides, shuffled back at the start, raced off the early going after poor break, moved up from the outside into the
stretch and made a good late rally. HOLY COFFEE showed good early speed, dueled through the far turn and faltered inside the eighth pole. THE DOVE
RULES raced two to three wide between rivals and had not enough in the drive. DEMAR'S LEGACY was bumped soundly at the start, raced near the inside
around the far turn through the stretch and never threatened. MISS SAYELY urged from the outside, raced three wide around the far turn and gave way.
STILETTO HEELS was bumped at the start, up close from the inside and faded.

ROMPING RUNNER chased the pace, moved up four to five wide into the upper stretch and finished well to kick clear late under strong encouragement.
MISTER COOPER was off slowly, urged three wide between around the far turn and kept on gamely to the wire. ZAINO was off slowly, moved up from the
inside around the far turn, angled out near the eighth pole and finished gamely to the wire. GOWOKEGOBROKE dueled two deep from the outside of rival
and weakened the final eighth of a mile. FIRST COAST STORM dueled near the rail and weakened through the drive. TREASURE FLAY stalked the pace
near the rail and faded in the drive. CAJUN'S CHOICE was off early pace, raced four wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. ARROW GHOST dropped
back to lost ground, raced far back and never threatened.
