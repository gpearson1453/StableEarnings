Footnotes
CATHAL (IRE) broke a step slow, settled three then two wide early, drew closer two then three wide on the far turn, mover out to take aim at the leaders,
surged late and overhauled the top pair to win clear. AMERICAN GLORY (GB) sat off the pace on the inside, angled out and launched a bid four deep at the
quarter pole, put a head in front outside MIDDLEBURG into the lane, lost command outside the eighth pole, battled back to regain command with a
sixteenth remaining but was overtaken by the winner late. MIDDLEBURG stalked the speed from inside, tipped out and bid three deep at the quarter pole,
put a head front past the eight pole but was overtaken by AMERICAN GLORY (GB) into the stretch, fought back and regained command near the eight pole
but got outkicked in deep stretch. ROSTOVSKY off slow in the beginning, chased four wide early on the first turn then moved down to the two path, raced
three deep on the backstretch, shifted to the two path then came back out into the stretch, rallied while drifting to the inside in deep stretch and closed the
gap late while earning a minor award. TRIBAL sent from inside and dueled into the first turn, chased the outer rival into the backstretch, bid two wide with
three furlongs remaining, took a brief lead at the quarter pole but was soon overtaken by outer rivals and weakened down the lane. FAUSTO unhurried and
taken to the inside at the back, drew closer while tipping two wide on the far turn, angled back inside in upper stretch and flattened in the final furlongs.
OMEY ISLAND tracked three deep, got moved out to the five path midway around the far turn, stayed wide to the stretch and weakened. GOODFELLA
(IRE) stalked in the two path, got floated out at the five-sixteenths pole, dropped back between rivals around the bend and got floated out again into the
stretch, then had little left for the drive. UNCLE MO'S GOLD dueled from outside briefly before taking control on the clubhouse turn, set the pace up the
backstretch, challenged at the three-eighths pole, lost command at the quarter pole and folded in the stretch.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE CAMIE stalked the top pair along the rail, brushed with rival late on the backstretch, waited behind the leader approaching the stretch, gained
an opening at the top of the stretch and challenged into the final furlong, inched ahead from the runner-up in midstretch and cleared in the final sixteenth to
win going away. CORPORAL VIOLETTE (IRE) pressed the pace from outside, took over in upper stretch, was no match for the winner in deep stretch and
stayed on to secure second. SWEET LAKER tracked off the rail then outside a rival, brushed with inner foe and ran on heels at the seven-sixteenths pole,
had to take hold briefly gain behind rival at the three-eighths pole, ran two wide through the turn, kept trying down the lane but could not get up for second.
BIG HOPES broke a step slow, trailed early on, went three deep between rivals early on the turn, remained three wide to the stretch and kept trying while
failing to threaten. FLYMETOTHEMOONBABY chased out of range off the rail, went four deep into the turn, drifted to the five path then moved in a few
paths to trail three wide into the drive and passed a tired rival in the closing moments. TOPOLINA bobbled leaving the gate, went up to take control while
under pressure from outer rival, showed the way along the inside around the bend, came off the rail at the top of the stretch, yielded at the eight pole and
tired.

SOUL OF MIDNIGHT away quickly then pressed the pace from between rivals, headed the pacesetter at the five-sixteenths pole, took over approaching the
quarter pole, cleared two wide into the stretch, continued clear into the final sixteenth and held safely under a drive. AMERICAN CAT bobbled twice leaving
the gate, stalked from inside then two wide around the bend, moved out in upper stretch, came with a late bid but was not enough. ROGUE SON trailed up
the backstretch went two wide into the turn then shifted to the inside, moved out in the lane and got outclosed for the place honors. MAN OVERBOARD
raced up close outside the top pair three deep into the turn, could not keep up and chased three wide around the bend, stayed within range entering the
final furlong but could not summon the needed late kick. ELECTOR broke inward then went up to take control while setting the pace under pressure, headed
at the five-sixteenths pole, relinquished the lead with a quarter mile remaining and weakened in the final furlong. CROWNING GOLD broke a step slow,
chased three deep into the turn, tipped four wide around the bend, moved out in upper stretch and weakened. EREBUS chased two wide into the turn,
dropped back around the bend and lacked further response. RES IPSA LOQUITUR stumbled a bit leaving the gate, chased widest up the backstretch,
rounded the bend four then three wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SIENNOIS (IRE) tucked inside off the pace, pulled the rider forward early on the backstretch, shifted to the two path around the far turn, split foes at the top
of the lane, surged late and overhauled IN SUSPENSE for the victory. ONE TIME MARK stalked two to three wide on the first turn, remained closest in
pursuit on the far turn, took aim two wide into the stretch, finished willingly late and regained the place honors. IN SUSPENSE sped clear two wide then
along the rail, set all the pace to the stretch, led clear into the final sixteenth and got reeled in by a pair of rivals late. BARTHOLDY tracked three wide into
the first turn, got floated four wide briefly then angled down to the two path on the clubhouse bend, chased between into the far turn, tipped three wide at the
quarter pole, moved out in upper stretch and finished evenly late. JOYRIDER broke a step slow, raced outside a rival at the back, moved out in upper
stretch and showed a mild response to improve down the lane. NITTI (IRE) off slow in the beginning, trailed along the rail inside a rival, hugged the rail to
the stretch, chased between rivals into the final sixteenth and improved position. NUCLEAR tracked in the two path, paused briefly in traffic at the quarter
pole while three wide and failed to menace in the stretch run. SIR MAXIMUS stalked from inside to the stretch and faded when called upon. BIG JUANITO
reserved in the three path outside a rival, moved into range three deep backstretch, stayed off the rail to the stretch and came up empty.

HAPPY JACK dueled inside TAHOE SUNRISE up the backstretch, carried a short lead into the turn, put away outer rival approaching the quarter pole, drew
away when asked right handed at the top of the lane, switched to the left hand at the eighth pole and drew off. DR. VENKMAN stalked behind the top pair,
ridden along from the rail midway around the bend, could not make any headway on the winner in the final furlong but stayed on to secure second. BIG
CITY LIGHTS pressed three deep to the turn, chased after the winner still outside a pair of rivals around the bend, came two wide into the stretch and got
outkicked for second. TAHOE SUNRISE dueled outside HAPPY JACK up the backstretch, kept the pressure on that rival to the five-sixteenths pole, lost
touch with the winner approaching the quarter pole and tired down the lane.

CIRCLE OF TRUST settled off the pace a bit off the rail, drew closer under a ride on the far turn, angled four wide into the stretch, took over outside the
eighth pole, kicked clear approaching deep stretch and held safely. SAKURA BLOSSOM took a bump from inside leaving the gate, traveled at the back on
the inside, trailed two wide into the far turn, swung out into the lane, finished well to gain the place but could not reach the winner. FAITH UNDERSTOOD
unhurried in the early going and moved inside, lacked room on the far turn and trailed a bit off the rail into the lane, went between rivals in upper stretch but
ran into traffic briefly at the eight pole, tipped out into the clear, then had to steady when losing her path near the sixteenth pole and kept on to gain third.
PINK WHITNEY broke out and bumped rival, raced two wide near the back, moved up three deep, bid three wide into the lane, fought to midstretch and
flattened in the last sixteenth. VISUALLY rated in the two path then stalked on the inside through the far turn, cut the corner into the lane, asked right
handed at the top of the stretch and weakened. SEA DANCER stepped to the front and moved inside, showed the way up the backstretch and far turn,
challenged from outside leaving the bend, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. SHILOH'S MISTRESS bobbled
leaving the gate, forwardly placed while racing keenly first time through the stretch, stalked three wide outside a rival around the first turn, ridden along two
wide on the second bend, got put in tight between the leaders and was forced to check at the top of the stretch, then faded past the eighth pole.

Footnotes
COACH CRONIN vied inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch, inched ahead into the turn, put away outer rival approaching the five-sixteenths pole then
met the bid from ARTIST POINT shortly after, cleared that rival and moved over to the rail entering the lane, found more when put to right handed urging in
the final furlong and drew off under strong handling. TEQUILA TALKIN brushed with outer rival leaving the gate, chased two wide then between rivals into
the turn, came under a ride two to three wide around the bend, was no match for the winner in the stretch run but stayed on to hold second. ARTIST POINT
chased along the inside, issued a challenge from the fence at the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up with the winner into the lane and was outfinished
for second. LAST CALL PAUL broke quickly from outside, chased the leaders from outside, navigated the turn five wide and weakened down the lane. BIG
BABY broke in and brushed, tracked off the pace two wide leaving the backstretch, ridden along on the turn, tipped four wide at the quarter pole and could
not rally after. CODY BOY stumbled badly in the beginning, trailed up the backstretch, altered out coming up behind a rival at the quarter pole, chased two
wide into the lane and improved position. CROWN PROSECUTOR traveled wide up the backstretch well off the pace, took the turn five to six wide and
failed to menace. PAY TRIBUTE broke slow and came in at the start, climbed early while a bit rank, went three wide into the turn, was still a bit rank on the
bend and angled out to the five path but was never a factor. S Y DREAM vied between rivals up the backstretch, failed to keep up with the top pair into the
turn, dropped back around the turn while angling to the inside and tired. WAR ON THE WEST vied three deep up the backstretch then pressed the leader
from outside into the turn, started to weaken around the bend and also tired in the drive.

Footnotes
REAL FIRE tracked four deep around the first turn, well placed outside the top pair in the middle stages, joined the fray three deep on the far turn, cleared in
upper stretch and drew away in a strong drive. MAHINA tracked three wide early, between foes at the half-mile pole, got boxed in three wide at the quarter
pole, shifted into the two path leaving the bend, rallied between rivals and got up for second. SIXTEEN ARCHES (IRE) stalked two wide then along the rail,
remained inside into the far turn, eased over to the two path again around that bend, tipped three wide into the lane and took aim at the winner but lacked
the needed late punch in deep stretch and lost the place honors. PASTICHE (GB) tracked two wide then moved inside, tipped out into the lane, summoned
a mild rally and missed third. RUGELACH pressed the pace from outside, moved up on even terms in the middle stages, fought between rivals past the
five-sixteenths pole, stayed on to upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BIG SUMMER settled inside, waited for room on the far turn, gained an
opening turning for home, tipped two wide in upper stretch, ran into traffic past the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker and was ridden out once in the clear.
BIG MAMA SUE raced two wide near the back, chased inside a pair of rivals at the halfway point, trailed into the second bend, swung widest leaving the far
turn and into the stretch and improved position. CAROLE LOMBARD traveled four then three wide around the clubhouse turn and dropped back off the
pace, climbed along early on the backstretch, raced three deep past half-mile pole, spun five wide into the lane, moved out further and failed to menace.
BELLE CHERIE showed good early foot to take control, showed the way along the inside under pressure, dueled up the backstretch, vied inside a pair of
rivals past the five-sixteenths pole, gave up the lead late on the far turn and tired down the lane. NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) brushed the gate and broke out a
bit, chased three deep into the first turn, went two wide into far turn, eased out and came four wide into the stretch but had little left for the drive. JAMIES
INHERITANCE stalked outside a pair of rivals into the first turn, chased two then three wide on the second bend and faded.
