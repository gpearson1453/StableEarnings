Footnotes
KING AND COUNTRY showed speed away from the start, contested the decent early pace outside of G G GILLEY, dueled that rival into the turn, took a
narrow lead while between runners at the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch, drew clear into the final sixteenth and was hand urged in the late
stages to prevail in a solid debut. LATER TAMARTATER was off slowly and spotted the field away from the gate, was unhurried in the early going, saved
ground into the turn, navigated traffic into the stretch, could not impact the winner in the final sixteenth and rallied for second in deep stretch. DRINKS AT
THE CLUB tracked the decent early pace from between rivals, chased three wide heading to the quarter pole, ran in pursuit to mid-stretch, was outfinished
for second in deep stretch and held safely in the end for third. NIGHTBIRDE IT'S OK stalked the decent early pace from the outside, was well placed into
the turn and chased three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and was outkicked in the final sixteenth. G G GILLEY
contested the decent early pace from the inside, disputed the pace with KING AND COUNTRY while inside of that rival along the turn, lost position into the
stretch and gave way. HOT GOBLIN forwardly placed away from the start, took back off of the decent early pace, tracked two wide to the quarter marker
and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
ANISETTE was hard to load prior to the start, prominent away from the gate, took back and tracked from the inside heading into the backstretch run, was
well placed at the half-mile pole, saved ground into the far turn then waited for racing room at the quarter marker, tipped three wide and loomed into upper
stretch, made a quick move to take command at the furlong marker, kicked clear into the final sixteenth, was geared down in deep stretch and held safely
for the win at the finish. CASTAGNA broke a step slow away from the start, recovered and stalked the early pace, attended to the decent pace through the
backstretch run, took a narrow lead two wide nearing the quarter marker and led into the stretch, was overtaken by ANISETTE nearing the furlong marker,
was able to close a bit into the winner' margin in deep stretch but was outfinished by ANISETTE and was well clear in the end for second. HANG ON broke
alertly and assumed early command, showed the way into the first turn, set a contested pace along the backstretch run and carved out a decent pace
heading to the half-mile, lost the lead into the far turn and chased the leading pair to mid-stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and just held for third at the
wire. ALMOST GOT LUCKY was forwardly placed in the early running, made a four wide move to challenge for the lead into the backstretch run, stalked the
decent pace while three deep at the half-mile pole, chased two to three wide into the far turn, gave way in the stretch and was outfinished for the show
honors. MISS PERU was unhurried in the early running, saved ground into the backstretch run, was content to trail nearing the half-mile marker, saved all of
the ground into the far turn and did not offer a late response. CARLSBADGAL tracked the early pace from a three wide path along the first turn, was well
placed along the backstretch run and tracked the decent pace nearing the half-mile marker, chased three to four wide into the far turn and lost position at
the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and weakened in the final stages.

Footnotes
TIGERIZE took back off of the early pace, was guided three wide into the first turn and tracked the moderate pace into the backstretch run, improved
position nearing the half-mile marker, chased two wide into the far turn and advanced nearing the quarter pole, angled three to four wide into upper stretch
and continued her steady gain at the furlong marker, rallied into the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch and got up in the final strides for a determined
win. SANGER STYLE was prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace from a two to three wide position into the far turn, attended to the moderate
pace through the backstretch run, advanced into the far turn and pressed RIVER MARKET nearing the quarter pole, drew to even terms with that rival into
upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker, gamely dueled into the final sixteenth, was tagged in the final strides by the oncoming TIGERIZE and won
the nod for second on the wire. RIVER MARKET showed good early speed and assumed command away from the start, set the pace into the first turn while
a bit off of the rail, was well rated through the backstretch run and set moderate fractions nearing the half-mile, set a contested pace into the far turn, battled
SANGER STYLE into the stretch, met that rival's bid past the furlong marker and dueled gamely into the final sixteenth, was outfinished in deep stretch and
just missed for second on the wire, while clear of the rest for third. ACHROMATIC hopped at the start and was away a bit slowly, was allowed to settle in the
early going, went three wide along the first turn, raced widest nearing the half-mile marker, improved position three wide into the far turn, swung four to five
into upper stretch, was gaining in the final sixteenth but could not impact the leaders at the finish. CALIGRAPHY tracked the early pace, was guided two
wide along the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace heading to the half-mile, saved ground into the far turn and
chased to the quarter pole, mounted an inside bid into the stretch, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and flattened out late. NO BEACHES
allowed to settle away from the start, saved ground into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run, got caught a bit in tight entering the far turn
and trailed to the quarter marker, improved position into the lane but needed more in the late stages. RIVER OF AMBITION broke alertly and was forwardly
placed in the early running, saved ground while tracking the pace along the first turn, lost position into the backstretch run, saved ground into the second
turn and was outrun approaching the quarter pole, could not muster a late response and did not threaten in the final stages.

Footnotes
YODERANDO broke best seized the early lead and set a measured pace two paths away from the rail, went in hand through the turn despite some pressure
from ROSES R BLUE just to the outside and TROJAN WAY another path out, held sway through the turn then responded when roused at the top of the
lane, opened up in upper stretch, then lost the lead inside the eighth pole then came back on under strong handling and intermittent urging to prevail.
ROSES R BLUE pressed the pace set by YODERANDO but allowed that one to set the tempo, went through moderate fractions to the turn, then moved up
to challenge in earnest from the five-sixteenths pole, bid three wide into the stretch and could not get by the rival at first then took a short lead in mid-stretch
but was outfinished in the final yards by the resurgent foe. TROJAN WAY stalked three wide to the turn, continued that path through the turn, bid for the lead
approaching the quarter pole, chased the top pair home but came up short in a good effort. MATCHLESS dropped far back early, started to run on from the
three-eighths pole, passed one but had too much ground to make up on the others. A BROKEN BREEZE was outrun early and chased the leading trio to
the turn, saved ground to no avail, lacked any rally and was never a factor.

Footnotes
THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) prominent away from the start, ceded the early lead to PRECEDENT LUKE and stalked the pace three wide into the first turn,
advanced into the backstretch run and prompted the moderate pace heading to the half-mile pole, battled PRECEDENT LUKE into the far turn and took a
narrow lead at the quarter pole, shook free into the stretch and was set down for the drive, was kept to task past mid-stretch and drew clear into the final
sixteenth, felt a bit of pressure from oncoming rivals in deep stretch and held safely for the win at the finish. ACERO was crowded a bit by a neighboring
rival and was away slowly, was unhurried in the early running, improved position two wide along the second turn, swung widest into the stretch, finished well
into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner into deep stretch and outfinished HARD MISSION to secure the place honors. HARD MISSION allowed
to settle in the early stages, raced widest along the first turn, improved position into the backstretch run, advanced three to four wide along the far turn, ran
evenly to mid-stretch, closed into the final sixteenth, was outkicked for second in the final strides and held for third at the finish. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE
settled just off of the early pace, was a bit keen into the first turn and tracked the leaders two to three wide into the backstretch run, was content to track the
moderate pace heading to the half-mile, maintained a two to three wide path into the far turn and chased to the quarter pole, was roused into the lane and
advanced at mid-stretch, ran in pursuit into the final sixteenth and was outfinished in deep stretch. RULER OF ANGELS was allowed to settle early on and
saved ground into the first turn, settled while not far back through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn, shifted two wide into the drive and
advanced at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and flattened out in deep stretch. BROTHER O' BRIEN settled in the
second flight leaving the start, raced in tight entering the second turn and checked off of heels at the the six-furlong marker, was unhurried through the
backstretch run, outrun into the far turn, improved position into the stretch but could not threaten the leaders in the late stages. PRECEDENT LUKE hard
sent leaving the start, assumed early command and set the pace into the first turn, set a prompted pace along the backstretch run and carved out moderate
fractions nearing the half-mile, battled THANKS MAGGIO into the far turn, lost position to that rival into upper stretch and chased to the furlong pole, could
not keep pace into the late stages and stopped in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
ROSE OF JERICHO broke well then alternately stalked and pressed UNION COACH through solid fractions, confidently ridden, went to bid for the lead at
the quarter pole but found a resurgent foe to the inside, battled on, gained the advantage inside the final furlong and pulled ahead in the final yards.
GREATFUL ATTITUDE raced between horses mid-pack to the turn, was looking for room through the turn then tipped out to the three path in the clear for
the stretch run, finished with a strong rally but came up a bit short in a solid effort. UNION COACH had a shoe repaired prior to the start, broke best and
went straight to the front with ROSE OF JERICHO always in close attendance, had something left turning into the stretch and fought off a bid by that foe to
mid-stretch then weakened a bit but held third well clear of the next horse. KEEPYOURPRANCEON raced between horses in the tracking group then
struggled to maintain position on the turn, lost some ground, then found a second gear passing the three furlong marker, launched a bid five wide into the
stretch and ran on some down the lane but was never a threat to the top three. POKER ALICE broke well but was not inclined to get involved in the early
pace battle, settled behind while holding the rail position, was roused at the quarter pole while still with a chance but did not quicken with the others and
finished evenly under pressure. DREWY took up shortly after the start, dropped to last then pulled under some restraint to be up near the leaders before the
turn, loomed a big threat passing the quarter pole then faltered in upper stretch.

LUNA LINDA sent leaving the start, engaged with LONGLIVECOWGIRLS in the early going and contested the solid pace with that rival heading to the
half-mile marker, shook free along the turn and led to the quarter marker, kicked clear into the stretch, was kept to task under moderate late urging and
maintained a clear lead to the finish to hold sway. ANN LOVES MARK prominent away from the start, took back off of the solid early pace and raced greenly
heading to the half-mile marker, slipped to the inside approaching the turn and improved position at the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the
stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, could not impact the winner into the final sixteenth and made a mild late rally for second. PURPLE MOUNTAIN
never far back in the early running, tracked the solid pace from the second flight approaching the turn, chased four wide nearing the quarter marker, raced
widest into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, rallied into the final sixteenth and missed for second, while holding safely for third.
LONGLIVECOWGIRLS was hustled away from the start, showed good early speed and contested the pace with LUNA LINDA approaching the half-mile
marker, pressed outside of LUNA LINDA into the turn, was outkicked at mid-stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for third.
INTRUSIVE settled just off of the solid early pace, tracked two wide approaching the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late response.
MAGGIE'S FAYE settled toward the rear in the early running, was hard to place while green entering the turn, maintained an inside path into the stretch,
could not impact the leaders in the final sixteenth but showed good late interest. BRONZE'S FLOWER took back off of the solid early pace, tracked from the
second flight heading to the turn, was guided two wide approaching the quarter marker and did not factor in the stretch. TOM'S TREASURE was forwardly
placed away from the start, chased the solid early pace while outside of the leading pair heading to the turn, lost position into the bend and went three wide
nearing the quarter marker, was outrun into the lane and tired in the final furlong. JEANNER broke out at the start and was off a bit awkwardly, lacked early
speed and settled off of the solid early pace, raced widest into the turn then lugged out nearing the top of the stretch, trailed to the furlong marker and did
not factor in the late stages. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
BIG DON'S SMILING got away in good order and tracked wide behind the pace, advanced forward on the turn while still racing wide, blew past the leaders
in upper stretch and drew away to a powerful win under steady handling. TITOS WITH A TWIST outrun from the break, was having to be ridden to keep up
but still dropped far behind, went into a stiff drive from the seven-eighths pole, sustained the rally three wide into the stretch, began to pick off horses one by
one down the stretch and managed to gain the place while never a serious threat to the winner. JERRY JEFF WALKER was under a drive from the break
but was unable to contest the pace, settled at the front of the tracking group the saved ground through the turn, finished well under steady handling up the
rail and gained third. HAVAKASH READY broke well, hustled to the lead but was overtaken for the lead before a furlong by STRETCH RUN, settled behind
then set off to challenge that one passing the five sixteenths marker, got to the front in the stretch for a brief moment then flattened out. STRETCH RUN
came away from the gate awkwardly then hustled to the front, seized the lead from HAVAKASH READY the opened up a couple of lengths on the field
heading into the turn, held the lead through the turn then came under pressure entering the stretch, started to weaken and was overtaken in mid-stretch.
CONTINENTAL UNION broke out a bit and was bothered without contact by STRETCH RUN, was not involved in the early pace battle, settled near the rear
of the field, came under a ride before the three-sixteenths marker but was struggling to keep up, was kept to task down the lane, switched to the outside and
came on a bit in the end but was unable to improve. LOADED MUSKET broke last then rushed up into contention racing a little erratically, stayed to the
inside, took up approaching the seven-sixteenths pole, lost momentum and was unable to recover, was kept to task to mid-stretch then eased when
hopelessly beaten.
