TONY SMALL unhurried, moved up on the two path through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear late. BEAR
CREEK never far back, gained position inside through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker,
then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. FIELDER vied for the early lead from between, gained a short lead on the two path through
the turn, then flattened the final furlong and held the show. LORD OF LEGENDS set the early pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged through the
turn, then faded the final furlong. FLAWLESS BOURBON well placed and outside, lost some ground three wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch.
BEACH HOLIDAY stumbled badly at the start and lost the rider, then walked off. AN INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE RESULTED IN NO

Footnotes
PHOBIA unhurried, looped to position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear late. HE'S A
LUCKY GUY allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and closed well for the place. ELEVATED
CAUSEWAY well placed and outside, gained a short lead on the two path through the second turn, then flattened the final furlong and held the show. SEA
URCHIN sprinted away from the field in the early going, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, came again in the lane, edged ahead, then
weakened late and held a share. ROUND ROBIN showed little. MR. IMPATIENT fractious in the gate, was a brief factor, fading down the backstretch.
