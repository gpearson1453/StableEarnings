leveled off. MY GIRL GABBY was in touch early and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. SEEDS OF

CHROME'S BIG BREAK set the pace, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch prevailed. FEW REGRETS was unhurried
early, moved up on the turn, switched outside in mid stretch and just missed. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY was well back, closed the gap on the turn and from
the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. SUPER MONEY tracked the leaders from the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the five
path at the top of the stretch evened out. GRADEVOLE was hustled early and forced the pace on the turn but came up empty. LEMONSANDDIAMONDS
was in touch but chased on the turn and had no impact.

alertly, dueled on the turn and was second best in a good effort. VICTORY MARCH was in range, saved ground on the turn and from the five path through
the stretch was up for show. FREE SQUARE was off slow and raced evenly on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick.
STRONG ENDING was in touch and hustled along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. MISTER BANJOMAN dueled early
and had a good position on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. KID FORESTER was off slow and roused on the turn but
from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. HALF TO RELOAD was off the pace, showed little and from the eight path at the top of the

BAJAN BULLET stumbled at the start, had the lead on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. BACK TO REALITY was up
close and a factor on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. M C JACKHAMMER was away alertly and hustled
along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. SPIRIT OF SEATTLE was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. BEYOND TALENTED was hustled early and raced evenly on the turn but had no rally.
MIGHTY PELE was well back and closed the gap on the turn but had no impact.

early leaders from the inside, was a factor on the far turn and had a bid in mid stretch but was second best. PAPERBACK HERO was off the pace, had a
mild gain on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for show. DOT'S VISION stalked the early leader but chased on the far turn
and from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. PALACE PRINCE was in range and raced evenly on the far turn but from the four path at the
top of the stretch needed more. THELONIOUS was unhurried early and saved ground on the far turn but was no real threat. SAME AGAIN DOC was well
back and showed little while outrun. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE was in touch early but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.

Footnotes
NATASHA'S BIZNIZ set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. MARY
MARGARET forced the pace and dueled on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. REMEMBEROLDTYMES was in range,
raced evenly on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held show. SWEET FINALE was in touch and hustled along on the turn but from
the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. DEVIL IN HER HEART tracked the early leaders from the inside and was roused on the turn but had
no response. A GAL FOR T J was off the pace, had a mild gain on the turn and from the seven path at then top of the stretch finished well. LOUEMMA was
unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but had no impact. EASY ACCESS reared at the start and moved up on the turn but dropped back through the
stretch.
