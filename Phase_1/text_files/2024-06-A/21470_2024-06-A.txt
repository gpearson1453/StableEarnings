BEACH READY rated along under a firm hold, ridden three wide near the quarter mile marker and finished strongly to edge clear under strong pressure.
PACIFIC PRINCESS prompt the early leader two deep from the outside, dropped back through the far turn, came again late from the outside and finished
gamely to the iwre. WORLDLY BEAUTY set a pressured early pace along the inside and weakened a bit in the final stages. ANDIE ONE settled off the early
pace, raced near the inside throughout and had no final winning bid. SALS DREAM GIRL raced three wide around the first turn, was off the early going,
raced five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. HARLAN'S LEGACY void of early speed, raced two deep near the quarter pole, shifted out six wide
and never was a factor.

bit inside the eighth pole. SOLOMONS GOLD stalked the pace, raced three wide near the quarter pole, raced five wide into the upper stretch and weakened
a bit through the stretch. GUILLAUME was unhurried early on, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. BIG BUCKSALOT

off the inside, raced between late and kept on willingly to the wire. DETROIT CITY raced mid pack early, saved ground through the far turn into the upper
stretch and had no late rally. FULL DISCLOSURE stumbled at the break, raced three wide through the far turn and never threatened. FEAST raced in a bit

Footnotes
SENTENZA raced four wide around the first turn, rated to race in hand down the backstretch, moved up three wide around the far turn, dug in late and
prevailed under all out pressure. DEVILMENT settled off the early pace setters, raced from the inside around the far turn, angled out finished gamely to just
miss. FAITH'S SPIRIT prompt the early leader from the rail, had a narrow lead into the upper stretch and gave way grudgingly late. ANNOINTED was
unhurried early, made a four to five wide bid through the stretch and had not enough for the top trio. OCONEE LIFE set a pressured early pace two deep
and weakened a bit through the drive. EXPERT WITNESS was off a bit slow, trailed early on and lacked a solid bid.
