slip through at the rail at various points for about a half mile, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened leaving the far turn. C R'S MANDATE

Footnotes
INTERCEPTION tapered in and stalked two deep, took the nod approaching the half mile pole and rated the pace from that point, came under pressure
toward the five sixteenths pole, widened through the far turn and was kept alert in the stretch. STATELY APRIL set the early pace inside, was met nearing
the half mile pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back toward the quarter pole and had to settle for second best. TIDBIT saved ground just off
the early pace, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. HERECOMESPUDD settled in the
three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and flattened stride. LOVE NOTION saved
ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. VALLEY STAR settled
in the four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. LADY FREE WILL was bumped leaving the
gate, raced in the five path the first turn and picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole but weakened in the three path on the far turn. HEY
MACARENA ducked in and made contact with Lady Free Will leaving the gate, rounded the opening turn about the three path, left the turn outside and
never factored. TIZ A TEMPEST broke through the gate prior the start then saved ground.

turn and held well with steady handling. RIVER MALBUMOONRVF stalked inside, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn
and ran evenly in the stretch. BRADLEY DO RIGHT stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn off the rail and dueled through the stretch for third. KAYLEE'S SPITFIRE settled in the four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. CHASE LIL ME broke awkwardly then saved ground on the first
turn, picked up the chase past the half mile pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. BAD LINEAGE raced off the rail the first turn,
moved to the outside into the backstretch and gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and weakened in the lane.

eighths pole but dropped back past the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened stride late. IHEARTRAINACOMN raced off the rail on

Footnotes

extend her lead. S S CASINO GIRL chased, raced off the rail on the turn and dug in leaving the turn, but flattened late while holding onto second. SPIRIT
ON THE WIND gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. BLUSHING BIP BOP chased through the backstretch, rounded
the turn about the three path and ran evenly in the stretch. MISS INTENSITY gave chase, raced in the five path on the turn and ran evenly in the stretch.
PALACIO gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path, left the turn outside and finished well. FROSTY RIA chased inside,
raced at the rail on the turn and flattened in the lane. ANOTHER FINE JUBA chased through the backstretch, raced in the four path on the turn and
weakened in the lane.
