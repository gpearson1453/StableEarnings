HANG THE MOON broke a step slow, tracked in the two path to the far turn, tipped out to the three path and launched a bid at the quarter pole, took over in
upper stretch, cleared a furlong out and held safely under urging. YERWANTHERE (IRE) broke a step slow, unhurried after and moved inside, drew closer
on the backstretch, eased over to the three path on the far turn, tipped out widest at the top of the stretch and rallied for second. LEISUREWEAR (IRE)
stalked the pace from inside through both turns, moved out a bit at the top of the stretch, finished well but got outkicked for second. ROSE MADDOX settled
inside, moved off the fence in the middle stages, was on the move four deep and challenged from outside at the quarter pole, fought to the eighth pole and
flattened out. LIBERAL LADY grabbed the early lead and moved inside, remained unchallenged to the five-sixteenths pole, tested from outer rivals a quarter
mile out, lost command in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. HIGHLANDS was closet in pursuit from the two path, chased between rivals at
the quarter pole, lost positions leaving the bend and tired down the lane.

SHES JUST FLUFFY broke out, pressed the pace from outside, took over and clear in upper stretch, then held well over the runner-up through the final
furlong. JUST IS broke a bit slow on the outside, stalked three deep to the turn, remained three wide through the far turn, took aim from outside entering the
final furlong but could not summon the needed late punch to reach the winner. SOLID TUNE chased outside a rival early, got put in a bit tight early on the
bend and dropped back, trailed two wide into the lane, steered out widest and kept on to whittle the gap while gaining third. SOUL OF A WARRIOR stalked
the pace from inside and was taken in hand when running up keenly behind the pacesetter, saved ground through the turn, moved out in the lane and
weakened. KEYCHAIN GIRL set the pace inside SHES JUST FLUFFY up the backstretch and around the turn, yielded to that rival in upper stretch and
folded.

HABEAS was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, closed in around the turn, took aim two wide entering the stretch, drew alongside the leader at the eighth
pole, fought on even terms into deep stretch, put a head in front shortly after and held over the late run from BARSABAS in the closing moments.
BARSABAS hit the gate then broke in and bumped, chased off the inside out of range, took the turn two wide, tipped out in the lane, finished well from
outside but was too late. JOHNNY DRAMA sped clear from outside, showed the way along the rail through the turn, confronted by HABEAS with a furlong
left to run, resisted to the sixteenth pole and was yielded late. KIMMER chased outside a rival at the back into the turn, got moved out to the three path
briefly then trailed two wide into the stretch, showed a mild response down the lane and improved position. JOHN DUNBAR sat off the pace on the inside,
ridden along through the turn, cut the corner into the stretch and lacked a bid. DR. SOULFIRE got bumped and crowded at the start, trailed early and moved
inside, tipped two wide late on the bend, moved out further in the stretch and failed to rally.

PETIT FILET dueled from inside, inched ahead early on the turn, put away outer rival at the quarter pole, put to right handed urging and drifted out a bit in
the lane but managed to hold safely. DORIE MILLER chased off the rail, moved into the two path early on the turn, tipped three wide into the lane, finished
gamely but lacked the needed late kick to pass the winner. SATELLITE HEART pressed three deep up the backstretch, chased the top pair three wide
around the turn, got moved out to the four path entering the lane and finished willingly for a clear third. WE'LL DO IT LIVE fought on even terms from outside
to the turn, pressed from outside to the five-sixteenths pole, could not kick on with the winner at the quarter pole and weakened in the furlong grounds.
DEFICIT MAJA chased within striking range from inside into the turn, dropped out of range around the bend, angled out into the lane and could not rally.

Footnotes
PACE LANE stalked three deep to the turn, challenged outside the the top pair at the quarter pole, battled down the lane and dug in late to get up at the
wire. DOUBLE BAY (IRE) dueled outside a rival in the early going, fought two wide through the turn, held a narrow lead between rivals down the stretch and
was overtaken at the wire. APPLE FEST dueled inside DOUBLE BAY (IRE) up the backstretch and around the turn, fought gamely along the fence inside
pair of rivals through the length of the stretch and came up just short. LA PEER raced outside a rival at the back, ridden along two then three wide on the
turn, tipped out into the lane, came with a late run and rounded out the superfecta. ANNIE'S HOPE chased outside a rival in the two path into the turn,
eased out and spun four wide into the stretch, finished well in the late stages but was edged for a minor award. DANGEROUS AFFAIR stalked the top pair
from inside, had to take hold behind the leader at the three-eighths pole then again at the five-sixteenths marker, tipped out leaving the turn and into the
stretch, chased willingly while needing to find room through the final furlong but failed to gain a clear path. IRISH ROSE sat off the pace, gained from inside
then two wide on the turn, steered back to the inside in upper stretch, looked to rally along the fence but was stymied at the sixteenth pole and never found
room. QUEEN BERKELEY trailed inside a rival to the turn, moved into the two path around the bend still at the back, swung out approaching the stretch and
never threatened. JAI HO stalked between rivals, rounded the bend in the two path still in an in between position, moved out in the lane and weakened.
SMOOTH AS BUTTER tracked the speed duel from inside, roused nearing the quarter pole and came up empty.

Footnotes
CALM SEA dueled down the hill then pressed from outside, fought on even terms around the far turn, took over past the quarter pole, cleared in upper
stretch, drifted over to the inside and held safely. DEAN MARTINI bobbled to the front, dueled down the hill from inside then took control first time through
the stretch, headed by CALM SEA around the far turn, yielded to the at rival with a furlong remaining and stayed on for second. LIVING LIFE got bumped
back at the start, traveled outside a rival at the back, angled out on the far turn and came five wide into the lane, showed late effort and gained the show
honors. MALTESE FALCON (IRE) raced outside a rival briefly then tucked inside, tracked along the rail off the pace to the far turn, saved ground to the
stretch, got boxed in upper stretch, tipped out in the furlong grounds and finished evenly. CROSBY BEACH was rank chasing behind the top pair down the
hill then started to pull first time through the lane on the inside, coaxed along two wide into the stretch, chased between rivals late and lacked a bid.
CARMELITA'S MAN got put in tight along the rail down the hill, traveled on the inside at the back, asked left handed trailing on the far turn, moved out in the
lane and could not threaten. HUDSON RIDGE bumped LIVING LIFE at the start, was rank early chasing off the rail, traveled two around the clubhouse turn,
moved closer up the backstretch, navigated the far turn three wide and could not find the needed response when called upon. MAN AMONG MEN stalked
two wide early, between foes in the middle staged, steadied into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the lane and could not rally.

Footnotes
PARENTING vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals early, pressed SCATIFY up the backstretch, headed that rival on the far turn and took over midway
around the bend, shook free when roused at the top of the lane, asked right handed at the eighth pole, continued to widen under hand urging in midstretch
and coasted in the last sixteenth. SCATIFY vied for the lead three deep around the clubhouse turn, inched ahead early on the backstretch, headed again by
PARENTING on the far turn and lost command at the five-sixteenths pole, fought back under urging to the lane, was no match for the winner in upper
stretch and churned on to hold second. CORNELL stalked the leaders from the rail, dropped back on the far turn, kept to task through the lane and gained
third. MC VAY broke a step slow, trailed two wide into the first turn then was taken out to the four path around the bend, moved into range from outside in
the middle stages, continued four wide on the second bend and lacked the needed response when called upon. MIRACLE MARK vied between rivals early,
took a stalking position on the backstretch, pushed on three wide through the far turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
BEE EYE GEE broke a step slow, stalked from inside, tipped two wide around the turn, moved out and bumped in upper stretch, challenged between rivals
into the final furlong, dug in late and proved best in the end. JUST A GRAZE forwardly placed up the backstretch off the rail, coaxed along two then three
wide on the turn, bumped with the winner in upper stretch, bid four deep at the eighth pole, fought three deep late and finished gamely to the wire. CAPITAL
OUTLAY showed the way early with company to the outside, dueled into and around the bend, resisted through the lane and yielded grudgingly late.
HIGHPLAINSDRIFTER settled off the pace outside rivals, went four deep into the turn, chased three deep at the quarter pole, produced a mild late bid but
could not reach the top trio. DESERT ROCKET was off slow to begin, climbed trailing early, moved to the inside, altered out nearing the turn, angled out and
bumped rival past the quarter pole, spun four wide into the lane and kept on down the lane. WASTING ACES came away slow, chased off the pace, ran up
on heels and checked past the seven-sixteenths pole, traveled along the rail on the turn, tipped out into the lane and improved position. TROTSKY broke a
step slow, raced near the back, lost his path and checked into the turn, went two to three wide around the bend and also improved position. KEEP IT
COMING sat off the pace while widest off all early, came in some leaving the backstretch, got bumped and forced five wide past the quarter pole and could
not make an impact. WESTERN GRIT chased for a bit then moved up to apply pressure from outside, dueled into and around the bend, fought between
rivals to midstretch and folded. DRIVE FOR SHOW settled in mid-pack off the rail, entered the turn three wide, moved into the two path around the bend,
steered out in the lane and weakened. SPLASHED IN GOLD chased while a bit rank up the backstretch, continued to fight the rider some around the bend
while saving ground, asked right handed into the lane and faded.
