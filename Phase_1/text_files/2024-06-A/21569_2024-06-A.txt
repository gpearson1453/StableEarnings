BEAUTY OF THE NILE vied in the three path, bid late to be clear and held off the closer under mild urging. RUBIA stalked the early pace inside, was
checked at the half-mile pole, raced well back, shifted to the four path at the eighth pole and rallied late and missed. PRISCILLA'S COVE vied between foes
and yielded late. TOURING WITH NETTA stalked the pace in the three path and lacked a late bid. RED WINE LADY broke inward, took back early and
improved position late inside. NO BODY LOVES ME vied inside before giving way at the eighth pole. CHIC N DA WADDA stalked the pace in the three path
but gave way in the stretch. SOLO PERFORMANCE bumped the start and then trailed.

Footnotes
HEAVENLY RICH stalked the pace inside, bid at the half-mile pole, angled out to the three path in the stretch, rallied and was going away under a strong
hand ride. HAZIEL stalked the pace in the three path, bid in early stretch and led briefly but couldn't hold off the winner. BEYOND JUSTICE settled inside
from the break, shifted four wide at the eighth pole and rallied belatedly. LADY ARTIST saved ground but had no late bid. SHIPSHEWANA saved ground,
angled four wide at the three-eighths pole and faded late. LILAH B led in the two path and gave way late. WHAT YOU WISHED raced in the four path, then
faded. UNAFRADE was not a factor and finished on even terms with TAMARAC LADY who pressed the early pace in the four path, stalked in the three
path, gave way on the far turn and was steadied at the eighth pole when a rival shifted out.

Footnotes
FOXTROTANNA stalked the pace in the three path, bid on the far turn, was clear and held off the closer under steady urging. SCOTTY'S ON EDGE saved
ground, was blocked at the quarter pole, angled four wide late, rallied and missed. IRISH HEARTBEAT bore out at the start, stalked the pace inside and
raced evenly. ALL JOKES ASIDE was bumped at the start, stalked the pace in the three path but had no late bid. NORWICH was bumped at the start, was
unrushed early, shifted to the four path at the eighth pole and improved late. SAMBALOVER saved ground and had no late bid. EXTRA HALO led in the two
path before giving way in the stretch. BERN N ASH trailed.
