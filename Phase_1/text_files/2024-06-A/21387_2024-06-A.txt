half mile marker, drew clear on the turn and then drew off leaving the turn to prove best under a drive. BEAR HUNT was five wide into the first turn, settled
on the outside, then moved in and advanced two wide by the quarter pole, angled out nearing the furlong marker and won the battle for the place award.
RENEGADE SERENADE was off slowly, then was five wide into the first turn, took back and angled in to the inside on the first turn, made a inside
advanced on the far turn, cut the corner leaving the turn and was out-kicked for the place award while clearly besting the rest. RUSSIAN HAMMER was four
wide into the first turn, rated on the outside, made a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole but could not sustain that bid and weakened. MELODY WIN was
allowed to settle early, dropped back by the half mile marker, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. GREAT CALL set the early pace while racing off

with the winner by the furlong marker and had a long drive but missed. OROCOVIX was allowed to settle early towards the inside, made a four wide bid
nearing the quarter pole but had no late kick while needing more late, clearly bested the rest. UNXPECTED TIGER was dwelt at the start and far back early,

ZAPRUDER was settled early towards the inside, then drafted behind horses two to three wide on the backstretch, moved out and came four wide into the
lane while in range, closed well to get up in time to prove best under a drive. COVERT KAT was rank into the first turn, then was settled under a hard hold
three wide, then was two wide on the far turn and made a bid off the bend, went on even terms approaching the furlong marker and then ducked in at the
gap for the chute, then was corrected and still led with a sixteenth to go but was denied on the wire to just fail. THE COLORA KID was rated along the
inside, then was two wide by the quarter pole and made a mild bid off the turn but needed more while besting the rest. SPLENDID SUMMER set the pace
on the inside and drew out on the backstretch to be clear, then was headed nearing the furlong marker and ducked in at the gap chute and weakened.
CARNIVORE tracked the pace two wide and to the inside on the far turn but weakened. HIGH DEFF (FR) was reserved early on the inside and lacked a
rally. NINTH OF APRIL was settled back early and had no response.

Footnotes
PRINCIPIA prompted the pace and made a three wide bid on the far turn to draw clear, then drew off leaving the bend and was given a couple pops right
handed with the crop, then was geared down the final hundred and twenty yards to prove much the best. ROWSIE EXPRESS set a pressured pace two
wide, then vied for command and fell back on the far turn then came again in the drive to gain the place award. YOU'RE THE ONE was rated along three to
four wide and then came four wide off the turn and finished willingly but was out-kicked for the place award. BELLA PALOMA was a allowed to settle early,
came two wide off the turn and had a mild late gain to just miss the show award, vanned off. BEACHGRASS was reserved early, came five wide into the
lane and had a mild late rally. THE HAUNTED ROOM was well placed early on the inside, made a early bid to set a pressured pace on the inside by the five
eights marker and then weakened on the far turn. KEEN LADY was rated along the inside and dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
SAGRADA RAY was well rated along the inside to the quarter pole, then eased out to make a three to four wide bid off the turn to take over and draw clear,
then remained clear to prove best under a drive. HOKU was off a step slow, reserved early, advanced on the turn and came five wide off the turn and
finished well. THE PENINSULA was settled early three wide, made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole but flattened out late, held show award.
CASTAGNO was off a step slow, settled back three wide, swung out eight wide leaving the turn and had a late rally to just miss the show award. SAMYAZA
was settled back early on the inside, came six wide into the lane and had a belated rally. BATTALION was settled on the inside and lacked the needed rally.
THE KING CHEEK prompted the early pace and then went up to duel three wide for command but weakened. U S CONSTITUTION tracked the pace three
to two wide and then tired in the lane. GUNSLINGER (IRE) set the pace on the inside and then dueled for command before tiring. GRAND PICK was
reserved early and failed to respond.

finished willingly for the place award. CARENTAN was reserved early on the inside, then was asked on the turn and came five wide off the turn, then lugged
in by the three sixteenths, then was given a pop left handed from the crop and was corrected and offered a belated rally to gain the show award. GAMBE
FORTE set the early pace while clear, then was headed leaving the turn and weakened in the final furlong. BEN'S HERO was settled early two wide, then
was four to three wide on the turn and had no rally. BIG TONE C was bumped at the start, chased the pace in between rivals, then moved to the outside on
the turn and was four wide by the quarter pole and came up empty in the drive. DOWNPATRICK broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, then

PAPER MANSION set the pace while clear on the inside, then was sent down leaving the three sixteenths, couple pops left handed with the crop, then
switched to the right handed crop to hold well to prove best. INANNA'S QUEST was rated along eafrly, made a four wide bid on the far turn nearing the
quarter pole, then was slowly gaining in the lane but could not get to the winner. CARROLL GIRL stalked the pace three wide and weakened while coming
back to gain the show award. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE was settled early on the outside, three wide on the far turn and had no rally. GOLD RUSH KIZZIE
tracked the pace on the inside and made a mild bid on the inside on the far turn but then weakened in the drive. SHE SO COOL was settled early on the
inside and lacked a rally. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO
ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

Footnotes
PEACH NECTAR effortless speed from the gate, tracked the leader from the two path, shook clear in upper stretch, and drew off from the furlong marker.
ETRETAT chased the pace from between rivals, bid just off the inside leaving the quarter pole, chased on through the wire, no match to winner. WOW
WISH was between rivals when rated back into the turn, put in a strong bid leaving the quarter pole, and finished willingly along the inside late. BAD HENRY
chased along the inside, angled off the rail around the turn, had momentum entering the stretch, and evened out late. JACK CLOUD clean start from the
outside, chased the pace from the five path, wide around the turn, was out kicked through the stretch. CITY HUMOR was a step slow leaving the gate,
rushed into position soon after the start, steadied between runners nearing the three eights pole, started to drift out very wide nearing the quarter pole, and
could not recover. LIMITED D'ORO slow away from the gate, raced well back and off the rail into the turn, and never threatened. WOOTDAREITIS hard
used early along the rail, had inside position into the turn, came under pressure around the bend, and faded steadily through the stretch.
