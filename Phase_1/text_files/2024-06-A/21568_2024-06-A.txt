INTO GOLDEN ROAD broke alertly and was quickly clear, roused at the half pole, then drew off under urging the final furlong. AMAZING ANGIE broke
inward, bumping HARLEY'SRUNAWAYKID, raced closest to the leader from just outside, angled inside INTO GOLDEN ROAD upper stretch, was no match
for that one the last eighth but held her position. MY MAMA SEZ bumped from the rear at the break, chased the top pair from outside and ran evenly
through the lane. MAN OF QUALITY chased from outside, angled in leaving the turn then closed the gap on AMAZING ANGIE and MY MAMA SEZ the final
furlong. HARLEY'SRUNAWAYKID bumped solidly at the start, was forced into MY MAMA SEZ, squeezed back and always outrun. This race had a timing
discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
DENNIS'S PRIDE gradually angled in as he vied for the early lead outside rivals, moved clear and gained the rail into the bend, lengthened command and
maintained control under steady handling in the lane. STANCE was a step slow then bumped shortly after the break, moved to the outside after two
furlongs, was in path four on the turn, angled in some for the stretch run, took over second, could not close the gap much on the leader the last eighth but
pulled away for the place. HE'S A FINE MAN pressed from between rivals, stayed in path three on the bend, also angled in some for the stretch run, was no
match for the top pair but held his position. SPAN hesitated at the start, was hustled up, saved ground taking the turn, gradually angled to the outside in the
stretch and passed a couple tired rivals. TRUIST chased from outside, advanced just off the rail on the turn, angled out midstretch but had no significant
response. RUN THE TABLE bumped STANCE shortly after the start, was prominent from inside but gave way on the bend.

SPICY DELIGHT stalked the early speed, went for the lead four wide on the bend, angled in some for the stretch run then gradually lugged in as she drew
off inside the last eighth under right-handed urging. GHALY POSSE hustled early, came into contention along the rail on the turn, loomed a serious threat
with a furlong to go, was no match for SPICY DELIGHT the final furlong. BIG SALLY vied for the lead inside rivals, was just off the rail through the turn,
began to drop back from close quarters midstretch, angled outside after entering the last eighth, fought for second but did not have enough left. SHINE
DOWN reared up at the break, trailed just off the inside, angled out on the bend, came widest into the lane and passed tired ones deep stretch. GOLDICAT
chased from outside and was never a threat. TENSE displayed early speed just outside BIG SALLY but gave way from between horses for the drive.

Footnotes
PADDY GAL broke inward, was rated on the front end from inside, moved ahead on the second turn when allowed, was roused leaving the quarter pole,
drifted out some entering the lane, gradually moved back toward the rail and shook off BACKSTAGE BAMBI under urging the last furlong. BACKSTAGE
BAMBI squeezed between horses at the break, was settled, gradually progressed from off the rail to threaten three wide on the second turn, angled in for a
clear path upper stretch, moved back outside PADDY GAL inside the final eighth, was no match for that one but proved easily second best. HER NAME
WAS LOLA also squeezed between rivals at the start, chased the early speed from inside, was a serious threat with a quarter mile left, leveled off for the
drive but was unchallenged for third. LUTION was soon far back and was never a factor. HIGHTAILING IT broke inward, crowding those inside her, shared
the lead outside PADDY GAL but began to fade before finishing six furlongs.

Footnotes
GRACEFUL SCARLETT rated behind the early speed, moved to the outside into the bend, took over three wide then drew off with little asking in the lane
and was much the best. CUPID'S HOPE progressed from path four on the turn, edged ahead for second as she gradually lugged in upper stretch, was no
match for GRACEFUL SCARLETT but pulled away for the place. HER SPEAKER'S ON broke alertly, was hustled along to vie for the lead outside rivals,
began to yield into the bend, came into the lane three wide, was gradually forced in upper stretch, angled back out as she moved clear for third inside the
last furlong then could only hold her position late. DIXIE RAG void of speed running widest, lost ground widest through the turn and passed outside tired
ones in the stretch. DERBY DAY GOLD trailed not far off the inside, fanned to path four for the drive, was blocked behind traffic inside the last furlong,
altered in abruptly with a sixteenth left and showed late interest between rivals. DON'T TELL ALYCE disputed the pace between horses on the backstretch,
yielded along the rail on the turn, was steadied while boxed in behind the fading RAIN ATTACK upper stretch, checked with a furlong to go and altered out.
NAUGHTY VISIONS was prominent from inside on the backstretch but faded with three furlongs left. RAIN ATTACK displayed early speed from inside, had
the lead early in the turn, did not stay with GRACEFUL SCARLETT going to the quarter pole and gave way for the drive. JUST AT MIDNIGHT stumbled
badly at the start and lost her rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into JUST AT MIDNIGHT'S start but no action was taken after their review.

Footnotes
KHOZAN'S VALENTINE reluctant to load, shared the lead outside FAST JACK once the race began, fanned out some entering stretch and caught the
weakening FAST JACK in the final strides. FAST JACK broke inward, bumping WILDWOOD SICILIAN, vied for the lead off the rail but inside KHOZAN'S
VALENTINE, moved ahead on the bend, drew off upper stretch, began to wear down inside the last furlong, drifted out the final sixteenth and was
outfinished. WILDWOOD SICILIAN bumped at the break, ran closest to the top pair while saving ground, angled outside FAST JACK upper stretch, rallied
belatedly inside the final eighth, angled inside the latter with a sixteenth to go, was too late but lasted for the show. BUREAU without early speed, saved
ground taking the turn, angled to the outside upper stretch, made a strong move but came up short. GO MADI GO saved ground and showed little.
STALLONE raced in the second flight from outside on the backstretch but faded two wide on the bend.

Footnotes
CREPE YARNS settled at the back running widest, gradually progressed from outside, was five wide taking the second turn, gained the advantage just
inside the sixteenth marker then drew off under a well-measured ride. TIZWOW raced in contention just off the inside from the early going, floated out to
path four entering the lane, vied for the lead between rivals deep stretch, was in tight quarters briefly with a sixteenth to go then edged ahead for second in
the waning yards. SMILE LIKE KYLE moved clear of the others on the first turn, took the rail, fanned out some into the stretch then gradually drifted out
under left-handed urging as he began to wear down inside the final furlong. MOVE IN SILENCE jostled with JUSTICEONEMORETIME going to the first
turn, was relaxed between horses on the backstretch, came into contention along the rail on the second turn, floated out some for the stretch run and
finished evenly. TAPINYOURBLUEJEANS also jostled with JUSTICEONEMORETIME going to the first bend, was settled just off the inside, angled out
three wide on the second turn, steadied briefly and altered to the rail when his path narrowed leaving that bend then made up minor ground along the rail
the last eighth. JUSTICEONEMORETIME jostled between rivals while in tight quarters going to the first turn, gradually progressed while toward the outside,
had a striking position 2 wide on the second bend, did not keep up leaving that turn, angled out to path four upper stretch and continued to gradually yield
between horses. UH OH IT'S MAGIC was checked behind traffic going to the first turn, prompted the pace from outside but gave way four wide on the
second bend. DRAGGING MAIN showed little in a ground-saving trip.
