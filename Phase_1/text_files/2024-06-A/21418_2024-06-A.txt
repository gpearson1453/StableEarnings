Footnotes
SHEZAFUNKYDRUMMER broke alertly to quickly open a clear lead, widened the advantage on the turn and continued on unchallenged through the lane
while well in hand. LIT MISS HAT TRICK stalked the pacesetter to the turn, was no match for that one and finished willingly as second best. COOLTHING
chased the top pair throughout , failed to gain on either and kept-on as best of the rest. OCEAN STAR went evenly without impact. J Z'S LAST SCHANCE
hesitated a step from the gate to drop back as the distant trailer and was never a threat. GOOD GOD reared at the start, rushed up while racing erratically
down the backside, taken in hand to be gathered together and was no factor from there.

RESOLUTION slow early to be the trailer turning for home, rallied through the lane finding her best stride to close with a rush and be up in time. PEGGY'S
WAY sped to the lead from the gate, opened a clear lead on the turn, held that advantage to mid-stretch, weakened late in the drive and was caught in the
final yards. TRIBEST (ARG) tracked the leaders through the bend and showed some mild late interest to be along for the show. SWEET SMILA stalked the
pace from the rail down the backstretch, was in tight against the rail nearing the three-eighths pole causing the rider to take up and finished evenly from
there. MAGGIE E pressed the pace for a half and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
BILL'S HONOR tracked the pace through the turn, steadily advanced down the lane and wore the pacesetter down in the final yards. STRANGE ARRANGE
set a well rated, well measured pace, opened a clear lead in upper stretch, responded when called upon and was caught in deep stretch in a good effort.
CLYDE'S GREEN GO unhurried early to be near the rear of the field and showed good late interest in the stretch to be up for the show. GOOD APPLE
broke a step slow, rushed up to a stalking position to be prominent turning for home and flattened out. BEEASY prompted the pace to the turn, ranged up on
the bend from three wide and weakened in the lane. MOONLIGHT ROAD circled up five wide with a middle move on the turn and faded in the stretch.
CHAMPAGNE MIKE was outrun.

SET THE PACE set a well rated pace on a comfortable lead, repelled a challenge on the turn to open up again while drifting out in upper stretch and pulled
away as much best. COMMAND POINT reserved off the pace and closed well through the lane to be up for the place. QUILTING PARTY tracked the
leaders to the turn and rallied in the lane to gain the show and just miss the place. SUMMER DAY tossed head entering the backside resisting the rider,
settled to stalk the pace, made a threateneing bid on the far turn to loom boldly and finsihed evenly, unable to sustain the rally. MORNING LINE NEWS
prompted the pace for the first half mile and faded coming home. LOTTA ROSES was outrun.

Footnotes
ROCKET HOTSHOT raced five wide through the first turn, settled to stalk down the bakside, worked way to rail, rallied inside turn, took lead in midstretch
and just held off the late closer. CANTSTEALMYTHUNDER settled off the pace for the first half mile, commenced a bid on the turn to rally six wide down the
stretch and closed well belatedly to just miss. UNIFIED WEEKEND unhurried for the first five-eighths, was set to a drive on the turn and made a steady
advance to gain the show. BLURT sped off to establish a clear lead ont the first turn, held that advantage down the backstretch, responded well when
challenged on the far turn and battled to mid-stretch weakening late in the lane. PARKER stalked the pace or three-quarters and lacked a closing response.
KRAMDEN tracked the leaders from the fence to the far turn and gave way on the bend. WICKED SUPRISE prompted the pace for a half mile, caame up
empty and galloped to the wire. WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR hopelessly outrun and was eased to the wire.

unchallenged to the wire a convincing winner. CATEGORY TEN tracked the leaders down the backstretch, rallied up the fence on the far turn and chased
the winner home as second best. CITY OF GOD stalked the pace throughout and kept-on to hold the show while failing to mount a closing rally. COMEDIC
TIMING rated in mid-pack, cut the corner turning for home and mounted a mild rally along the fence. CHICKS FOR FREE unhurried early and passed tiring
rivals in the lane. PATH TO SUCCESS hesitated at the start to be a step slow, clipped heels several jumps from the gate, bobbled severely and lost all
chance yards from the gate. REMEMBER THE MAINE was not a threat. MEATLOAF'S CHANCE bled and was vanned off. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE START OF PATH TO SUCCESS, UPON REVIEW THEY DETERMINED NO CHANGE SHOULD BE MADE. THE WINNING
