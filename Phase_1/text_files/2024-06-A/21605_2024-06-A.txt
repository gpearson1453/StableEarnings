Footnotes
HONORARY DEGREE broke out at the start and was corrected, chased four then three wide briefly before tucking to the inside at the nine-sixteenths, rode
the rail through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, came out slightly a furlong out brushing with
RIBBONS AND MEDALS, then dug in under a drive to issue a challenge and seize command seventy yards from the finish and prevailed by a neck over a
late charging rival. MOUNT TRAVERS coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered up his best stride late to close stoutly outside and miss by a
neck. FIRST DEPUTY coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick. STRIKING SPEED coaxed from the gate, vied briefly from the three path between foes before shaking away to sole command albeit
under pressure from RIBBONS AND MEDALS to the outside, tucked inside through the turn and widened away as a pair from the rest of the field, spun two
to three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat and was caught seventy yards from home and
weakened in the very late stages. RIBBONS AND MEDALS coaxed from the start, vied four to five wide outside a pair early on before prompting the pace
from the two path, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late going. MORNING CUP brushed the near side stall at the start, got
coaxed to be in front and vied briefly inside a pair of rivals from the two path before being shaken off, chased just off the inside through the turn coaxed
along from midway, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
COMPLEXION bobbled while breaking in front then angled in while speeding clear early, was challenged leaving the backstretch, vied in the two path on the
turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, drew off under one tap of a down-turned crop near the furlong marker and
widened under a solid hand-ride to win ridden out with her ears pricked. SILVER CIRCLE veered in at the start but broke in second position, chased the
pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and proved no match
while well clear for the place. BOSSY PANTS was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced towards the rear under urging, dropped from the five
path to the three path on the turn and just got up for the show. DOUBLE CAPPUCCINO came away in good order, was urged along on the outside, dropped
back late on the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and just missed the show. BOSSY DISH chased
the pace, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch, raced between foes into the final sixteenth and
missed the superfecta. IL SUO ORO broke a step slow, was urged along at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten. NANANANABOOBOO broke in and brushed the gate then was bumped and forced in, dropped back while trying to regain balance
and was slow into stride, raced towards the rear under urging, was taken in hand leaving the backstretch, came back under encouragement in the two path
on the turn, brushed with a rival outside the quarter-pole then was taken in hand again and came up empty. LUCKFORYOU chased the pace, saved ground
on on the turn, pursued the winner into upper stretch and tired. SHEER WILL was off a step slow, raced near the back under urging, was taken in hand
while tight against the rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, brushed with a foe outside the quarter-pole and steadied then failed to
respond.

Footnotes
RABAJA coaxed from the gate, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to prevail. DAKOTA COUNTRY hustled from the gate, tracked the pace along the
inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one, ran on to secure the place
honors. HARD PAR stumbled at the start to his knees and conceded four to five lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, crossed directly to
the inside soon after and saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and showed good
courage to rally up the inside and procure the show honors. KORU coaxed from the start, tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under
coaxing tipped two to three wide three furlongs from home, went seven wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. ENGLISH CASTLE grew
rank under restraint when RABAJA crossed to the inside in front into the first turn, remained pulling the bit rankly through the first turn before settling to track
from just off the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
MASTER FREUD three then two wide through the first turn, tracked the leader in closest aim just off the inside, came under encouragement at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. MY LIFE STORY three then two wide through the first turn, chased two
to three wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, offered up a bid five-sixteenths from home, swung six wide into upper stretch
and weakened. WITHIN VIEW coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled
five wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact. COPERNICUS chased two then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled four to
five wide into upper stretch and tired. BERNING BEAUTY just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun two

Footnotes
TWO FOR CHARGING was forced out at the start then brushed with a foe, raced between foes early then settled off the pace, drafted inside for most of the
turn then moved to the two path, waited behind horses into the stretch, was roused near the three-sixteenths pole, rallied into the final furlong and closed
well to get up in the final sixteenth and prevail. REFUAH was restless in the gate, brushed with a foe after the break, showed speed between horses then
chased the pace, went four then five wide on the turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear
for the place. SIN NOMBRE broke out then brushed with a foe, showed speed between horses then dropped back outside the half-mile pole, chased while
moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, pursued the runner-up in the drive and lacked the needed kick while
able to get the show. GIANT'S FIRE was bumped at the start and forced out, dropped back early then was urged along at the rear, went around most of the
turn in the two path, angled out late on the bend, reached the five path outside the quarter-pole then gained six wide into upper stretch, remained on his
inside lead in the drive and weakened then missed the show. SHOWDOWN KING broke out and hit the gate then was hustled, contested the pace on the
outside then in the three path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. IN A MINUTE was restless in the gate, came outward after the start and
bumped with a foe, contested the pace on the inside of rivals, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage at
the top of the stretch and faded.

MAURITIUS established the front past the stands the initial time and showed the way in hand along the inside through the first turn and then just off the
inside down the backstretch under pressure from UNION EXPRESS who knocked heads with him while in hand through sensible splits, tucked inside near
the three-eighths marker forcing ST. JOE LOUIS to take hold off his heels after having a clear rail momentarily just prior, remained patiently handled until set
down taking the inside route into upper stretch, drifted out slightly near the eighth pole while eding away to the finish kept to task. ST. JOE LOUIS (GB) got
bumped at the start by LA MAQUINA, who broke inwards, tracked the pace along the inside, got clearance along the rail near the seven-sixteenths and
advanced, then got forced to steady when MAURITIUS tucked inside near the three-eighths, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, ran on through to the
finish to willingly secure the place honors. UNION EXPRESS three wide through the first turn, attended the leader from the outside three then four wide
knocking heads while under light rating through sensible splits, tucked to the two path into the far turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
two to three wide into upper stretch, kept on to procure the show honors. BEARY FUNNY two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. GOLDEN PURCHASE coaxed from the start, raced just off the inside
through the first turn and then three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. LA MAQUINA broke in at the start bumping ST. JOE LOUIS, chased
long the inside patiently handled until set down spinning from the two path into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. NOBLE HUNTSMAN just off
the inside through the first turn, tracked three then two wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered
no response. VIN SANTO three wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
stretch and offered no rally. JUNGFRAU struck the near side stall at the start, raced a bit keen and pulling and was off the heels of KING FREUD seven
furlongs from home, went just off the inside through the first turn and was taken hold to move over the back heels of VIN SANTO into the backstretch when
wanting to head to the outside, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and tired. KING FREUD
bobbled at the break, raced three wide through the first turn then chased four then three wide, went four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SOLOSHOT settled in a good position just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was coaxed behind horses into upper stretch, tipped out for room while
roused for more inside the three-sixteenths pole, rallied to make a bid coming to the sixteenth-pole, reached even terms for the advantage while between
horses late and out-nodded the runner-up under strong handling. GEOPOLITICS went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the
action while inside on the turn, cruised into upper stretch under her own power, was asked coming to the furlong marker, came under stronger
encouragement under threat outside the furlong marker, fought on well with the winner to the finish and was denied in a head-bobbing finish. BEING BETTY
was hustled from the gate, showed speed then pressed the pace on the outside, was urged along in the two path on the turn, fought on determinedly in the
stretch, battled outside the top two late and just missed while able to get the show. SOHANA broke a half-step slow, settled at the rear, saved ground on the
turn, was roused near the quarter-pole, moved out in the final furlong and improved position with good courage. MY SHEA D LADY was urged along off the
pace, saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, came four wide into the stretch then tipped further out and lacked the
needed kick. NAUGHTY DESTINY broke a half-step slow, settled off the pace, moved in late on the backstretch, tucked into the two path on the turn, was
asked for her best in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. WAR TERMINATRIX settled towards the back, was roused while two to three wide on
the turn, came four wide into the stretch while behind horses then dropped in and failed to rally. FIND YOUR JOY stalked the pace on the outside, was
given her cue in the three then four path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch then floated to the six path, drifted out some more in the drive and
capitulated.

three-sixteenths and went clear under a drive, then got geared down in the very late stages. HE HAS IT ALL got bumped at the start by CONCORDE
SPIRIT, who broke inwards, raced five paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while along clear of the rest and second best.

through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish to secure the show honors. STORMY'S
DREAMING broke a half a beat slow and was forced to be taken in hand and altered out when IRISH TENOR took over his lane, chased just off the inside
and then along the inside under coaxing from midway, swung three wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. ROYAL BROWNE broke in at the start
bumping HEY TOBY, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired. IRISH TENOR got
carried out at the start by the breaking outwards YO BANANA BOY and in turn forced STORMY'S DREAMING to steady and alter in behind, chased along
the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. CLANCY FANCY chased five paths off the inside
down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six to seven wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
ANILEATE was moving around at the start and off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, settled towards the back on the inside, was urged along on the far
turn, came between foes in the two path into upper stretch, rallied to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, fought inside of her stablemate to the finish and
narrowly prevailed in a nice ride. MORE MANGO was hustled from the gate, saved ground on the first turn, angled out early on the backstretch, made a
middle move on the outside, gained to make a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the far turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole,
kicked clear while remaining no her inside lead in upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead outside the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth, fought on
gamely with her stablemate late and was denied while clear for the place. KANNON FIRE was reserved while two to three wide, came under urging on the
far turn, dropped in near the furlong marker and willingly earned the show. SILENT MELODY moved in early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was well
placed just off the pace, went around most of the far turn in the two path then shifted three wide while asked, pursued the runner-up in the stretch and
lacked the needed kick. MISS FASHIONISTA went two then three wide on the first turn, settled while given cover, was roused while moving from three to
five wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response. LA VITA SOFIA went three then two wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved from the
two path to the four path on the far turn and failed to rally. DIAMOND STATUS raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside,
made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied between foes in the two path on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. MISS KRISTY broke a step
slow, dropped well behind early, lagged at the rear while in the two path on the turns, came out into the stretch and was no factor. LADY JASMINE went to
the front, showed the way on the inside, was headed outside the quarter-pole and faded. THIRTEEN RED FLAGS went three wide on the first turn, settled
on the outside, dropped back three then four wide on far turn, moved in into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
BUNNY HONEY settled tracking the front just off the inside from mid pack, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, got set
down angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge inside the final furlong, dug in between foes taking command just inside the final
seventy yards to the finish and inched away in the last jumps to prevail. MISS CITY GIRL got brushed at the start by ADULT ENTERTAINER, who broke
outwards, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on
willingly battling with a pair of rivals through the final furlong to the finish and secured the place honors by a head on the wire. LUNA PATINA chased two to
three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, dug in under threat
and was collared with seventy yards to the finish and fought on inside a pair of foes to the end. ADDAGIRL ADDIE tracked the pace along the inside settled
in mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, rallied in tight at times along the rail to the inside of PAMPLONA
RED and improved position to secure the last major share over a quartet on the line. LU'S REDEMPTION coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the
inside, got let out spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. PAMPLONA RED coaxed from the start, showed the way in
hand along the inside under some pressure from LA FIERE to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole, weakened in the late going. SHE'S A NATURAL broke open her stall door prior to
the start, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the
finish. LAURANA settled just off the inside just off the pace, remained patiently handled and behind foes until let out spinning three then two wide into upper
stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. SAVANNAH DANCER saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing just off the inside three furlongs
from home, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ADULT ENTERTAINER broke out at the start brushing MISS CITY GIRL, chased two
to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and made no impact. LA FIERE three then two wide through the first
turn, prompted the leader from the outside three then two wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and
tired. NOBLE DISGUISE coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide through the first turn and down the backstretch, went four wide through the far turn
coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide at the top of the stretch and proved no factor.
