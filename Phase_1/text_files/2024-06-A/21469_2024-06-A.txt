Footnotes
COME BET dueled up front out of the chute, continued to alternate in the run up the backstretch and into the turn, gained a slightly larger advantage
entering the stretch and edged away through the lane under steady handling. NOISE COMPLAINT broke on top, set or forced the pace outside the winner,
gave ground grudgingly to that one through the stretch, remained well clear of the others. CAPTAIN DOZER broke outward and a bit awkward, moved up to
race closest to the dueling top two,. continued to pursue those two throughout, made little if any progress on that pair through the lane, remained clear of the
others. JEANO remained back in making little impact. GOSPEL DANDY was finished early while racing three wide. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING
DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

Footnotes
STARBURST with the pace past the wire the first time off the inside, fell back slightly to press the other speed up the backstretch, reengaged that one late in
the final turn, took over at will and steadily drew out through the stretch under a hand ride to win ridden out. MAJOR CONTENDER moved up to vie inside
the winner soon after the start, showed the way onto and up the backstretch, dueled again with that foe through much of the second bend, proved no match
in the drive, held sway for the second spot. MAJESTIC LOVER one paced toward the inside, improved position slightly into the stretch,slowly getting to the
runner up late. INCORRIGIBLE flashed brief speed three wide into the first turn, fell off the top pair before a half and tired the final quarter. MEGA BOND
last away, remained back in failing to threaten. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO
TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

Footnotes
DERBY DAY LASSIE broke sharp from along the inside, asked along through the turn and into the lane, held the next two comfortably safe under continued
steady handling without rider carrying a crop. STORMY BISONETTE back off the early pace while outside, continued to be outrun into the turn, dropped
inside when advancing into the stretch, up for the place late while not a threat to the winner. HOT TUB HOTTIE chased the winner while racing off the
inside, crept a bit closer turning for home then could do nothing further with that one, caught late for the place. HEY ROXY within striking distance in the
three path up the backstretch, came up empty when weakening in the stretch. HUSHED remained back in lacking a closing. TRIBAL QUEEN off a step
slow, raced back, failed to menace in trailing throughout. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING
VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

Footnotes
LAPIS LAZULI broke behind the leaders, moved out, prompted the first flight four wide through the first turn, challenged on the outside onto the backstretch,
put a head in front before a half and steadily increased that advantage without feeling the crop to win ridden out. SHADOWLESS last to leave, raced in the
second flight inside the winner past the wire the first time, got out into the first turn to be very wide, recovered onto the backstretch, moved inside for the
second turn, improved while saving ground through that bend, finished up willingly to be clear for the second spot. SPANISH HOMBRE broke with the
leaders, contested the pace inside, could not hang with the leader into and through the final turn, continued to chase into the stretch, caught for the place.
HUNTER QUICK with the early pace while between horses, had little left for the stretch run. DOCTOR TINK broke sharp, with the early pace three wide,
began to give way before a half inside the winner. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO

Footnotes
MR SEEKER broke in good order, took over onto the backstretch, set the pace while racing toward the inside, extended that advantage a bit into the stretch
then held the runner up at bay under firm handling. LEGEND'S JOURNEY broke sharp, relinquished the advantage soon after leaving the chute, chased the
winner off the inside, fell back a bit turning for home then crept back within striking distance. TAKING ENERGY raced in the second flight while well out in
the strip, came four wide for the drive, could not do much with the top two in the late stages, edged clear of the others. OLD TOBY went one paced
throughout while saving ground. C J'S LEGACY broke back, lacked a closing response. KHAN RUN broke a bit slowly and failed to menace. THIS RACE
HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE
TIME.

Footnotes
FRIDAYNIGHTSOLDIER unhurried early along the inside,moved out a bit into the first turn, advanced in the three path into contention took over and kicked
strongly clear. SLICK COUNTRY BOY vied three wide past the wire the first time, briefly shook clear into the far turn, offered little resistance to the winner
turning into the stretch, held the runner up position while kept to pressure. MONEY EXPRESS dueled with the runner up while getting out a bit into the first
turn, continued to race with that one onto the backstretch, fell back off that same rival with a quarter to run, withstood a challenge through the lane to save
the show. HERO TIME in the man group outside, floated out to be five wide into the far turn when the winner came out a bit, went evenly to the wire
thereafter in not having enough for the third spot. RING BEARER off the early pace inside, steered out first turn, put in a bit tight while three to four wide and
outside the winner as that one moved out a bit into the far bend, went one paced to the wire in coming up empty for the drive. JUST OKIE off a step slow,
remained back. GOSPEL BUZZ fell back to trail after the start, showed little. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS

Footnotes
WILD CHEROKEE broke alertly, cleared toward the inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, asked along late in the final turn, kicked well clear through
the lane in a sharp effort. BOSS ON THE RUN pressured the winner early under encouragement, fell back off that one onto the backstretch, chased in vain
thereafter to prove no match, held the place. FREELOADINGSISTAH in mid pack while racing toward the inside, closer into the far turn, lacked a further
response to finish up evenly. AMOUREUX in the main body outside, four wide into the far turn while being asked, went flat through the stretch to be
outkicked for the show spot. FLAT OUT FANCY carried very wide into the first turn, moved up to mid pack the second quarter while continuing outside,
flattened out in the drive. O S U BUDKE prompted the pace while racing three wide for three furlongs and began weaken. OPTIMISTIC WOMAN raced back
off the pace and lacked a closing response. UNBRIDLED KISSES in the second flight, began a steady retreat before a half. IMPUDENT raced back early,
bore out into the first turn carrying out FLAT OUT FANCY, continued to lack speed in trailing, never a threat. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY
OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

Footnotes
SHAWK'S LIL MIA close from the start, pressed the leader into and through the first turn, continued to hound that one in the run up the backstretch, took
over late in the final turn and kicked clear with authority. PAULA M broke with the leaders, set a pressured pace along the inside, held a narrow advantage
the middle three furlongs, proved no match for the winner through the stretch, clearly second best. REALITY CHECK forwardly placed while four wide first
turn, raced in the second flight up the backstretch while continuing outside, dueled to the wire for the show spot, determined for that position while not a
threat to the top pair. SHOOTIN RUN within striking distance toward the inside, long drive for show, outkicked for that position while also no match for the
top two. MISS LONG LEGS off slowly, raced back early, improved the middle part then failed to sustain that advance through the stretch. RAINBOW
SMILES also away slowly, trailed well back, began to pick it up into the far turn, traffic 3/16,stride late. SEATTLE WILDCAT raced back off the pace, went
evenly in lacking a closing response. CREES VALENTYME settled in pack early, had nothing for the drive. SPLITSECONDECISION raced in the main body
while off the inside, began to tire far turn. GOSPEL FAITH flashed brief speed along the inside and stopped. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY
OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

Footnotes
WILD WING broke sharply along the inside, vied early closest to the inside, clear before a half, cruised up the backstretch a second time and was not
threatened through the lane while being kept to pressure. COLE TRICKLE void of speed, began to advance late backstretch, came five wide into the lane,
continued in willing fashion to be up for the place late, not a threat to the winner. MR. KUNTATA with the early pace while between horses, fell back off the
winner before a half,shifted out a bit the middle three furlongs, chased that same foe through the final turn, could do little in the drive, nipped late for the
place. RIGHT CIDER checked up just after the start in traffic, dropped inside, continued to save ground while joining the second flight chasing the winner,
weakened a bit in the drive to lose a couple of positions. CLINTON QUARINTINO void of speed while racing outside, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after
the issue had been deiced. ABES DAY settled off the pace and the inside, continued off the rail and gave way in the drive to trail home. WHAT ABOUT
JIMMY came in after the start to tighten up RIGHT CIDER, contested the early pace three wide, began to fade after a half, continued to back up in the run to
the wire. E D'ORO four wide and under pressure through the second turn, gave way the final quarter. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR
MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.
