Footnotes
DREAM ON BABY prompted the pace in the early going, waited patiently on the fence behind the frontrunner around the bend, took closer order to bid
inside at the top of the lane and determinedly rallied on the rail at the furlong marker to hold for the win in deep stretch. FRAC RIGHT broke through the gate
prior to the break, was in tight, being squeezed by the outside horse after the start in the early part of the backstretch, was taken back nearing the half to
watch the top pair down the backside, moved in smartly two wide at the quarter pole, briefly poked his head in front in upper stretch but could not hold off
the winner who had something more to offer nearing the finish line. MR. MARSHALL broke inwards on the break, continued to lay in on the inside runners
after the start, edged away for the lead nearing the half, opened up on rivals entering the turn, was collared on both sides turning for home, was no match
for the top two down the stretch and managed to save third money at the finish line. MEKO MAKEE stalked behind the front trio after the start, saved ground
making no impression on the leaders throughout the turn, shifted out to be four wide in upper stretch, was in range for the show prize with a sixteenth to go
but needed more late to threaten for third at the wire. COMMANDER AT SEA was void of early speed to trail outside along the backstretch, offered a mild
rally three wide midturn until to the op the stretch in the four path but had little to show in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
TRIZZEL TRAZZEL stalked inside near the rear along the backstretch and throughout the turn, inched closer six wide straightening out for the drive, was full
of run, reaching for ground at the three sixteenths marker and wore down the leading rival in the final seventy yards for the score. VALLEY GIRL stalked
outside close to the back in the early stages, stared to pick up foes comfortably three wide outside horses at the half, bid five wide turning for home, drifted
in when urged right handed driving down the stretch nearing the furlong marker and was no match for the surging winner outside in deep stretch.
SYSTEMATIC pressed the pace with horses on either side five furlongs from the line, was throttled down to track the front two with three furlongs to go, was
in the mix battling up front in the four path between runners at the quarter pole, was pushed inwards, checking mildly on the rail nearing the eighth pole and
was not a threat to the top pair in the late stages. TEXT ME UP was unhurried to see the field down the backside, continued to trail around the bend, swung
out widest closing the gap smartly in lane seven at the top of the stretch and was gaining mildly to the wire while not switching leads. CEFALO had a good
spot behind the front trio along the backside, shifted out off the tiring early leader with five sixteenths left to run, was behind runners in the four path at the
top of the lane but failed to menace between rivals in the stretch. CRUMLIN BIRD forced the issue three deep outside five furlongs from home, assumed
command three eighths out, could not maintain the lead in the three path by upper stretch and wilted in the final furlong on the fence. SEATTLE SIGNAL
cleared to the lead on the rail by the five eighths marker, was headed outside with three furlongs remaining, offered no resistance and emptied out in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
BIG GINGER took control from the onset, was nursed along rationing out her speed through the turn, finally was set down for more at the eighth pole and
quickly spurted clear to win going away at the wire. HEKLA'S AURA stalked outside having only one foe beaten down the back straight, improved position
passing foes running inside at the quarter pole and finished up with good intent, bursting between runners with a sixteenth from home to close in and best
the rest. TAYLORMOON applied mild pressure to the front running winner along the backside, continued on the rail chasing the leader through the turn,
loomed the main threat on the fence straightening out for home, had nothing left in the tank by the furlong marker and faded to save the show award when
crossing the finish line. HELLUVA HOLIDAY was nudged on to stay interested while trailing the field with a half mile to run, saved ground but made little
headway around the turn, shifted outside closing in on rivals at the furlong marker but had to settle on the fringes in the end. PLUS POWER tracked the
leaders while travelling inside at the half, was scrubbed on three furlongs from home, rallied inside though the turn, battled in the stretch four wide with a
chance for a minor placing of some sort down the lane but gave way nearing the wire. TIS A PITY tracked outside in the second flight down the backstretch,
was roused for more three furlongs out, had little to offer around the oval and retreated outside in the five path at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
BLAMELESS GHOST settled in the back half of the field racing off the rail two to three deep into the turn, moved out while beginning to advance four wide
past the three-eighths, swung six deep turning for home, drifted in a bit in upper stretch, exchanged minor bumps with an outside foe while dueling with that
one, struck the lead a sixteenth out and edged clear under steady handling. TWISTED ROMANCE was in just a bit tight after the break, settled toward the
back inside, swung out seven wide turning for home, engaged the eventual winner from outside in upper stretch, dueled with that one in mid-stretch
exchanging incidental contact, was outfinished but second best. SAUCY NAME broke out a bit, chased the loose leader three to four wide into the turn
racing alone, moved closer to take the lead near the five-sixteenths, was clear in upper and mid-stretch but overtaken by the sixteenth pole while best of the
rest. VRANA (IRE) shifted in racing near the rail mid-pack into and on the turn, angled out five wide by upper stretch, fought on in the battle for the super to
win the minor award. GO GIFFEN settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, advanced inside a rival near the quarter pole, was angled out three wide
soon after, ran on and needed more. KID GIZMO was outpaced while outside runners at the back, went five to six wide on the turn swinging nine deep into
upper stretch, drifted in a bit in the lane, ran on evenly to split the field. ARYA'S QUEST broke a step slowly but made a steady early advance up the
backstretch and on the turn three to five wide, evened out in the stretch. MAIKEN THE VIKING lacked early speed, went four to five wide on the turn, swung
eight deep into upper stretch, ran on passing some foes. FULCRA chased from inside on or just off the rail, came up empty. WHISKEY N ICE got away well
and was quickly clear, set the pace inside, faltered and faded. OUR STELLA chased up close three to four wide and outside rivals, faded in the stretch. LA
GRIGIA was up close between runners early, began to drop back at the half, tired.

SECRET LOAD had an ideal set up watching the front trio engaging for the lead down the backstretch, was patiently handled settling on the fence, waiting
to move around the bend, lost her path trying to go through the four hole in upper stretch, quickly re-rallied, shifting in two wide at the furlong marker and
drew off in the late stages for the score. UNHEARD travelled in mid-pack between rivals in the beginning, split foes smartly in the three path with a quarter
to run, loomed boldly in the four path straightening out for the drive and tried valiantly to reel in the winner late but was second best on this day. MAGIC
MODIE forced the pace in the two path with runners on both sides, poked her head in front with five sixteenths from the wire, was clinging onto the lead with
an eighth remaining, could not go on with the top two in deep stretch but did stay for third money. ZIBIBBO shadowed the frontrunner three deep outside
foes along the backside, kept pace three wide on the turn, was in range if good enough between foes in the five path turning for home and won the duel for
the minors in the end. ALL FOR HONOR trailed the field inside in the early going, began to pass foes midway through the turn on the rail, dueled for a small
piece of the prize in the stretch, shifted out with a sixteenth to run and finished up willingly to the wire. NOYZEE GIRL travelled in midfield, three deep
outside of horses, closed in three wide through the turn, was fanned out gaining momentum six wide at the top of the lane, could not sustain the rally and
stalled at the furlong pole. PRINCESSONAMISSION had a slim advantage inside down the backstretch, continued to lead by a narrow margin three eighths
from home, ceded the lead on the fence by midturn, did battle stubbornly inside to the sixteenth pole but folded in deep stretch. MARDENE hopped on the
break, stalked outside having one rival beaten inside down the back straight, could see the field with five sixteenths to run, was asked right handed at the
quarter pole but made little impact driving to the finish line.

ALLISTON prompted the early pace then continued the pursuit two to three wide just off the leader and in the clear, steadily ground on in the stretch taking
the lead past the furlong marker then held a late challenge from MRS. C, who chased from outside foes three to four wide into the turn, came into upper
stretch about three deep needing more, was guided out past the furlong marker and finished strongly with aim on the leader but couldn't quite reach that one
while lugging in and out a bit. HALEY'S HONOR appeared to hit the gate lightly but was no worse off and quickly moved to the front to set the pace, faced
pressure by an outside rival early, moved clear of that one coming past the five-eighths, was challenged by mid-stretch and soon overtaken, fought on well
but was no match for the winner and outfinished for place. GOOD NEWS MONEY chased three wide floating out a couple paths coming out of the turn,
bumped with an outside foe in upper stretch, ran on for the minor award while no late threat to the top trio. PRINCESS JADE shifted in saving some ground
near the inside on the turn, came out five wide in mid-stretch and ran on. CATE'S CHARM lacked early speed at the rear off the rail, angled seven wide in
upper stretch and kicked on mildly. MAURYA tracked not too far off the leaders inside on or just off the rail, failed to rally. GET OUT THE VOTE dropped
back from between runners early while outpaced, was never near enough to threaten. ONDINE LADY was caught outside runners five to six wide through
the turn, made a mild advance coming into upper stretch, exchanged a bump at that juncture, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
QUIET MADDELENA had a nice journey all alone down the backside watching the front two contest at the half, shifted outside starting to close in at the
quarter pole, switched leads in upper stretch, finding another gear at the furlong marker, reaching for more ground and was going away convincingly when
crossing the finish line. SUMMER SNOW pressed the pace inside after the start, seized control on the rail by the half, opened up moving well with five
sixteenths left to go and just could not hold off a fast charging winner down the lane. BLAZING SKY hopped on the break having a slow start seeing the field
along the backside, swung out four wide turning for home outside horses and closed belatedly to the get up, surging at the wire to for the show award.
HIPNOTIZADA broke sharp to lead in the beginning, was relegated to a chasing role through the turn but could not reel in the pacesetter, began to weaken
with a furlong to go being separated from the top two and faded late to lose the show award in a photo at the wire. GOGO SHOES stalked inside down the
backstretch, shifted outside midway on the turn to pass runners, was one paced down the stretch and could not get involved in the driving to the wire. JILL
stalked outside in the early going, could not quicken with the leaders while travelling inside through the turn, began to shorten stride in upper stretch, had
little to give down the lane and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
GET MY DRIFT broke inwards on the start bumping a rival, had a nice set up by herself measuring the dueling leaders down the backside, took up the
chase with three furlongs to go, closing in throughout the turn, pounced three wide at the top of the stretch, under a vigorous ride started to pull away from
rivals at the furlong marker and won by a comfortable margin at the finish line. CHERRY GARDENS settled between runners in the third flight down the
backside, shifted out off a weakening challenger five sixteenths from the wire, closed in smartly while in hand around the turn, was a menacing presence
outside in the five path straightening out for the drive, could not match strides with the winner by the furlong pole and battled to the finish to dead heat for
second money. MO TWILIGHT took this field while hounded outside down the back straight, put away the early pace foe with three furlongs remaining, was
travelling well setting the fractions around the bend, was collared outside in upper stretch, could no longer fend off the winner by the eighth pole and did
show some grit to re-rally in deep stretch to dead heat for the place share at the wire. CEE'NCEESGREYTNESS was situated three deep in the third flight
down the backstretch, kept pace but lost positioning around the turn, continued to keep coming inside entering the stretch and ran to the wire to garner a
small piece of the prize in the end. LADIES RUM stalked inside near the rear in the beginning, made little headway three wide outside rivals on the turn,
shifted outside, six wide for the drive and finished up willingly, passing runners down the lane. SLOANS SKY stalked close to the back of the pack on the
outside in the early stages, had a brief turn of foot splitting runners three furlongs from the prize, angled out to the five path straightening out for home and
finished up evenly between foes in deep stretch. MOET MONET travelled on the inside in mid-division along the backside, shifted off the rail to be three
wide by the half, improved around horses making a good three wide run on the turn, battled for a minor role at the top of the lane, could not go on late and
faded in the last sixteenth. BLING D'MONEY HOME was bumped outside to trail in the beginning, continued in last not closing the gap on rivals through the
turn and passed a weary runner down the lane. GOLDEN SPRING forced the issue outside down the backstretch, gave way chasing the pacesetter three
eighths out, backed away through the field on the rail around the bend, had nothing left to offer down the stretch and galloped across the finish line.
