Footnotes
BROWN LIQUOR MAN was unrushed inside, angled three wide just past the quarter pole, rallied and was clear under a strong hand ride.
KARLWITHANARL stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the half-mile pole outside of the leader, then couldn't hold off the winner. FIREWATER JAKE
dueled early outside of a rival, bid near the eleven-sixteenths pole to be clear, then couldn't last in the drive. NIP N TUCK was unrushed early and found his
best stride late in the four path. CADET CORPS broke outward, then raced evenly in the four path. STORM DADDY dueled inside early, settled along the
rail and gave way in the stretch. HARD RYE GUY was squeezed back at the start, saved ground and lacked a late bid. CRONUS was not a factor.

Footnotes
BASSCOAT was unrushed in the two path, hugged the rail on the far turn to commence a bid, dueled through the stretch and prevailed under a strong hand
ride. CORONA GRANDE vied inside, dueled through the stretch but was outfinished. LOOKIN AT JUSTICE saved ground, bid in early stretch but was no
match for the top pair. SAKIC pressed the pace between before giving way at the quarter pole. TOUR THE MOON was off awkwardly, raced in the two path
and faded in the stretch. KILLER HOTROD pressed the pace in the three path before giving way at the quarter pole. KINGOFTHERAINBOW stalked the
pace in the four path, loomed five wide at the quarter pole but faltered. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
