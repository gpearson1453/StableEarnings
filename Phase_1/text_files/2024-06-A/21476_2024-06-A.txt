Footnotes
VALLEY VICTORY was hustled to seize command from the onset, set the pace unopposed down the backside, felt pressure from the threesome outside
closing in at the quarter pole, was asked for more in upper stretch to spurt away mildly by the furlong marker and under a well rationed ride just held on at
the wire for the score. COHERENCE brushed outside rival on the break, was then allowed to settle, trailing the field leaving the chute, waited patiently
behind the chasing trio mid-turn mapping out which path to take for the drive, took the overland route in the five path turning for home and was getting closer
with every stride but just missed in a tight photo at the finish line. WHERE IS ESSA had a rail trip tracking inside at the half, chased the pacesetter closing
the gap at the quarter pole, shifted out to the two path for the drive and stayed on willingly between runners to be a clear third at the wire. TOWN'S
WARRIOR tracked four deep outside horses down the backstretch, chased the frontrunner going three wide outside foes around the bend, loomed in the
four path at the top of the lane but lacked a finish and could not pose a threat in deep stretch. TREBUCHET trailed the field outside at the half, made no
headway saving ground around the oval and had little offer inside driving to the wire. AGILE DANCER was brushed inside on the start, tracked in the two
path between rivals along the backside, chased two wide throughout the turn, was still in the mix in the three path straightening out for home but faded at
the furlong marker. MOMENT OF PEACE tracked in the three path with runners on both sides down the backstretch, was shuffled back losing positions at
the half mile marker and could not make any impression afterwards.

Footnotes
WAR IN CHARGE got over to the rail to lead on the fence into the first turn, dictated terms unchallenged up front down the backside, opened up, increasing
the lead on the far turn and was kept to the task to hold on by a diminishing margin at the finish line. CHASING TROUBLE settled in mid-field on the rail,
relaxed in hand down the backstretch, rallied smartly passing rivals inside midway on the far turn, shifted out, gaining momentum two wide at the quarter
pole, posed the only threat down the lane and was closing in with each stride but could not get there in time. DARE TO BE KING travelled on the fence,
sitting behind the frontrunner on the first turn and throughout the backstretch, tried to keep pace with the winner around the final bend, shifted out to the
three path at the top of the lane and finished up willingly to be a distant third at the wire. BLONDINA'S BOY chased the leader in the early parts of the race,
was encouraged right-handed with five sixteenths from home to go after the loose pacesetter, could not close the gap on the final turn and faded inside at
the eighth pole to settle on the fringes in the end. MUCHO MAGNIFICO tracked four wide outside foes in the first turn, settled in mid-division three deep in
the back straight, was hard ridden making little headway on the leaders throughout the final bend but did finish up with intent to duel three wide outside for
the minor share at the wire. PARADISE PERFECT was restless in the stall prior to the start, had one foe beaten down the backstretch, saved ground
improving on the fence at the quarter pole and was one paced between horses in the stretch run. BIG SHOOTER stalked three wide on the first turn,
continued outside foes three deep in the backstretch near the back of the pack and could not find more to menace in the stretch drive. OH PEANUTS
tracked the top two on the outside in the second flight along the backside, could not make any impression around the far turn and wilted in the two path with
runners on either side at the furlong pole. BEER MOSA trailed the field into the first turn, could not gain on rivals down the back straight and had nothing to
show in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
LIVIN ON LUV settled nicely three wide watching the contesting duo into the turn, began to creep closer three wide at the top of the stretch, was
encouraged right-handed at the eighth pole, found more late to surge and get up in the final few strides for the tally. RETAIL THERAPIST battled for the
front on the outside in the early going, was content to shadow the frontrunner down the backstretch, seized control three furlongs out, opened up on the field
in upper stretch, began to get leg weary at the sixteenth pole and faded to the winner in the final seventy yards but did manage to just save the place share
at the wire. SWINGING MANDY co-led on the inside after the break, emerged with a clear lead entering the turn, was then relegated to a chasing role three
eighths from the wire, fought on determinedly inside down the lane, re-rallied, closing the gap and edging closer to the leaders in deep stretch. MICHELE M.
travelled in mid-pack between runners through the turn, shifted out to the three path behind the eventual winner at the top of the lane and could only finish
up evenly in the stretch for a small piece of the prize. TALK TO YA LATER had a good position on the rail sitting behind the leaders waiting to make a move
throughout the turn, was shuffled back to last at the top of the stretch inside and could only pass a tired rival driving to the finish line. ROYAL BLUSH had a
poor start to begin to trail after the break, settled near the rear three wide stalking on the outside of horses, shifted out to be in the four path straightening out
for the drive, had little left to offer and tired at the furlong pole. FRIENDS FOR LIFE broke outwards, bobbling on the start, was ahead of only the other poor
starter down the backside, could see the compact field in range on the fence through the turn, shifted out widest in the five path turning for home but had no
kick in the stretch running.

Footnotes
NORTHERN RUBY settled into stride under a light hold in the early going tracking in behind the leaders. KAVALA was forced in just a hair at the start,
stalked from outside well-positioned just off the leader, was mostly three to four deep, kept on strongly in late stretch but was simply outkicked. AMERICAN
GAMBLE broke alertly but inwardly just a bit, set the pace and shifted in nearer the rail, dictated terms up the backstretch racing just off the fence into upper
stretch, led till late but was outfinished. MORE SAVVY broke outwardly bumping a rival, stalked from mid-pack, went three wide on the turn, came out a bit
in the stretch, ran on evenly. WINYAH BAY settled off the pace, brought up the rear outside a foe midway on the turn, angled six to seven wide turning for
home, had mild late interest. WICKED MIAH was outpaced, saved ground on the turn, was never a threat. MI TORMENTA broke a step slowly, made a mild
early advance outside into the turn four then five wide, could not sustain the effort. CHARLOTTE'S SILVER was bumped at the start, lacked early speed
bringing up the rear outside, made a mild middle move from the five-sixteenths, fanned eight wide into upper stretch, flattened out.

Footnotes
VALYRIAN SKY shook clear for the outright lead down the backstretch, was going quite comfortably loose up front around the oval and had more in reserve
in the stretch to continue on for the score. CRIMINAL INTENT had a slim advantage after the start, tracked inside in the second flight by the half, chased the
winner in vain through the turn and in the stretch but never wavered and bested the rest for the place share at the finish line. POSTURING watched the front
two in the four path with rivals on each side in the backstretch, came under a ride between horses two wide through the turn, continued to battle on, turning
for home and won the duel for the show award with seventy yards to go. COOLER MAN was unhurried to trail inside after the break, shifted outside of
runners with five furlongs to go, made a sharp move circling foes three wide midway on the turn, loomed a presence in the five path straightening out for
home, could not continue the run and stalled in the final sixteenth for a minor role in the end. SHAMATEUR tracked outside horses in the five path in the
early going, took closer order at the half to watch the loose frontrunner outside, was shook up by the rider between foes at the quarter pole, offered little
response but did finish with some interest to stay on fighting between runners in the last sixteenth. PONTIAC watched the front two in the three path
between rivals down the back straight, settled in midfield on the inside at the half, was scrubbed on the fence at the quarter pole to be in range at the top of
the lane but had no finish to give in the last furlong. HATMAKER GIZMO stalked near the rear in the two path along the backside, saved ground but made
little impact on the rail through the turn, angled out five wide for the drive but was empty for the run to the wire.

Footnotes
TITO'S CALLING tracked from inside not too far off the leaders, came out passing the quarter pole, took aim on the leaders, struck the lead in mid-stretch
while starting to drift out, continued to drift while forging clear. MARKSMAN QUEEN (GB) was in tight heading to the first turn, took back and switched
outside the pacesetter and moved up on that one pressing from between foes still under a tight hold early up the backstretch, contended turning for home
taking the lead at the three-sixteenths, was overtaken past the furlong marker and outkicked. WICKENHEISER was bumped on both sides a few strides
after the start, settled at the back off the inside, raced mostly three to four wide, found room in mid-stretch and kept on for show honors. AMAZIN QUEEN
settled off the pace near the rail, advanced in upper stretch two to three wide reaching striking distance, evened out and needed more. TIME FOR AN
ANGEL bumped a rival just lightly after the start, settled mid-pack outside about four wide, continued four deep through the far turn before angling outside a
rival at the top of the stretch, ran on. ME AND MY SHADOW raced up close and outside three to four wide early, applied minor pressure briefly up the
backstretch, drifted five wide turning for home, weakened. FLYING BLACK bumped a rival a few strides out of the gate, moved to the lead and securing that

Footnotes
WAR PAINTER was travelling well in mid-pack entering the backstretch, began to inch closer with three eighths remaining, bid for the lead outside in the
three path straightening out for home and under a vigorous ride with left handed urging, wore down the frontrunner in deep stretch for the win. NOW IS A
BREEZE took command from the onset, set even fractions by the half up top, braced for the challenge from the eventual winner at the top of the lane, fought
on down the stretch on the fence but gave way grudgingly just before the wire. HOLIDAY IN JAIL was content to track behind the loose leader in the first
turn, chased the pacesetter down the backstretch, could not go on with the top two around the final turn but gamely never gave in to the wire and continued
to fight on keeping up in deep stretch for a clear third in the end. GREAT KATE settled near the rear, three wide into the first turn, stalked outside in the third
flight down the back straight, was asked, offering a mild run outside three wide at the quarter pole and evened out in the final furlong for a small piece of the
prize. DYNA'S FLATTER stalked inside on the first turn, made little progression running on the rail along the backside, could not quicken with others three
furlongs out and lacked any rally in the drive to the wire. MORAL TURPITUDE bore out at the start, trailed the field by many in the first turn, caught up to a
rival at the top of the stretch but by then had nothing left to give for the drive.

HIGH TREASON travelled alone in mid-pack with four furlongs left, burst between rivals making a menacing move at the quarter pole reaching for more
ground, shifted out, full of run in the four path straightening out for home, took command at the furlong marker, switched leads late and won going away at
the wire. SILENT PATSY settled on the rail near the rear in the early stages, was asked three eighths out, improved on the fence through the turn, had clear
running room inside at the top of the stretch, was no match for the winner but put in a game effort and easily bested the rest for the runners up share.
TEXENSIS tracked inside in the second flight with a half mile remaining, edged closer on the rail by mid-turn, lacked running room in the four path at the
quarter pole and rallied with an eighth left to run to be a solid third crossing the finish line. IMPECCABLE TIMING had a slim lead between rivals leaving the
chute, battled outside setting solid fractions at the half, was collared outside in upper stretch between runners, drifted through the lane and held on for a
minor share in the end. STORMY OCEAN hopped and broke inwards on the start, to be ahead of only one horse beaten down the backside, made a brief
run five wide around foes at the quarter pole, shifted out to the six path in range at the top of the lane and finished with some interest to the wire. ZODIAC
BEACH was void of early speed to trail in the beginning, started to go by runners inside three furlongs out and passed weary rivals in the stretch. SHES A
DARLING was unhurried, near the back of the pack outside runners, could see the field with three eighths remaining, angled out widest in the five path
straightening out for home but could not get into contention down the lane. CALM COOL forced the issue inside at the start, dueled on the rail, setting a
quick pace at the half, was engulfed on both sides at the top of the lane and stopped through the stretch. MRS. BENJAMIN veered out sharply on the break,
recovered quickly to press outside leaving the chute, was reined back to watch the contesting duo outside foes at the half, had no response when roused at
the three furlong marker and backed away through the field four wide by the quarter pole. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #4 TEXENSIS AGAINST #6 HIGH
TREASON IN UPPER STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED
