SPELLCAST tracked leaders to turn, rallied along in the stretch edged clear in the late going. THIS TIME dueled to the half, inched clear through the stretch
but caught on the wire. SHADOWY was a very reluctant load ,well placed from the gate to the far turn, ran on with a stretch bid but weakened in the final
furlong WHO DA BOSS no speed to far turn, ran on to improve in the late going. BLUE NOMORE raced along evenly, with no response when needed.
GUNNER GABRIEL never threatened throughout. GAPPER failed to menace throughout. C V DYNAMIC always outrun. FACT NOT FICTION speed to the
front, led to far turn and gave way readily. EKATI'S WAY through after half and gave way readily.
