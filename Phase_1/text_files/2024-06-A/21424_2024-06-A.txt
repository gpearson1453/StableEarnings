eighth pole, gained command past the sixteenth marker and edged away for the win. JOY AND PROSPERITY was off slowly, bumped and steadied, raced
off the pace, saved ground throughout, angled out entering the stretch and rallied outside for second. POSTINO'S PROPHECY raced two wide off the pace,
three wide at the half mile marker, bid two wide on the turn, dueled between rivals in the stretch run and was outkicked. SEA MAIDEN set the pace on the
inside, dueled on the far turn, dug in through the stretch drive and weakened late. SADIE BABY pulled on the inside and was steadied early on, settled off
the pace with an inside trip, waited for room at the quarter pole, then lacked a clear path in the stretch run. LASSIE'S NOTION was off a bit slow, bumped
and steadied, raced three wide off the pace and failed to threaten. PERSPICACIOUS stalked the pacesetter in the early stages, then chased and faded.

Footnotes
ON THE DOT tracked close up on the inside, made a rail bid at the quarter pole, quickly took over, drew clear and was kept to the task. TIMBAVATI stalked
close up two wide, bid three wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside in the stretch and proved second best. PLEASANT EMBRACE set the pace on the
inside, drifted out a bit midway on the turn, then weakened and just held on for third. WHATTA WORLD stalked three wide, chased on the turn, rallied mildly
outside in the lane and just missed for the show spot. MADNESS stalked between rivals early on, then chased inside on the turn and lacked a rally.
HARPER BE GOOD raced off the pace between rivals and failed to threaten. BUCCHERA raced off the pace inside and did not factor. PERMED raced
three wide off the pace and did not factor.

LLOYD stalked three wide, bid three wide on the turn, led into the stretch, pulled away under urging and coasted the final yards. MOTION TO STRIKE raced
three wide off the pace, chased outside on the turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied for second. MISTER MOORE trailed the field, moved up on the
turn, rallied mildly outside and was along for the show spot. HAPPY FARM stalked close up two wide, bid between rivals on the turn and weakened. JOKER
BOY raced off the pace between rivals, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. HE IS BONAFIDE set the pace racing with a clear early lead, dueled into the
stretch and gave way at the furlong marker. HIGH YIELD KITTEN raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
