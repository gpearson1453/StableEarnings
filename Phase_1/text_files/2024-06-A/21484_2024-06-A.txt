Footnotes
LUCY L prompted LAKER JET from along the outside, gained a slight lead nearing the eighth pole and gradually edged clear late. LAKER JET saved
ground setting the pace under pressure from LUCY L, responded when challenged by that one but wasn't quite good enough in a game effort. MERINO
WOOL was reserved off the early pace while saving ground, angled out slightly to split rivals on the backstretch then angled back in on the turn and finished
in a mild rally. OAT MILK LATTE was forwardly placed while racing three-wide but lacked a rally. SHES GOT THE POWER saved ground while racing in the
middle of the field and failed to seriously threaten. TIZ FOR REAL was allowed to settle while racing three-wide and failed to menace.

CLASSIC LEAH saved ground setting the pressured pace, responded when roused and was fully extended to prevail naorrowly. RED PANTY NIGHT
prompted the issue while racing three-wide, engaged the winner nearing the quarter pole, vied with that one from that point and finished strongly to just
miss. MISCHIEF MAMA was close-up from the beginning, angled out to be four-wide nearing the quarter pole, could not reach the top two but finished well
in a steady effort. HEAT SEEKING LETA was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and improved her position. CONFIDENCE BUILDER saved
ground while being allowed to settle, steadied nearing the quarter pole lacking racing room and finished willingly when clear. FOR YOU ONLY disputed the
early pace while racing between horses and tired.

CHUCKANUT BAY saved ground setting the pace and drew clear during the drive. EVER A REBEL prompted CHUCKANUT BAY from along the outside,
was no match for that one but held on well for second. PIRATE RED was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and finished well for the show in a steady
effort. LUCKY CODE was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide into the stretch then angled in nearing the eighth pole and rallied late. HALF
THROTTLE was allowed to settle early, angled out to be four-wide nearing the quarter pole but lacked a rally. FIREWALKER was unhurried early, came
five-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. RIMROCK LAKE chased the pace from along the inside for a half mile and gave way.

Footnotes
CREME DE MENTHE prompted SHE'S SO SHINY from along the outside, took the lead entering the stretch and gradually drew clear. SHE'S SO SHINY
saved ground setting the pace to the stretch and held on well for second when headed. JUST CLASSY was bumped at the start by EMERALD SEA then
dropped back while saving ground, slipped through during the drive and rallied late. OUR LYLA GRACE was off a step slow then moved up along the
outside on the turn, offered a mild bid leaving the quarter pole then flattened out during the drive. IN THE VAULT was close-up early while racing two-wide
and weakened during the drive. EMERALD SEA broke out to bump JUST CLASSY then settled in the middle of the field but was not a serious threat.

Footnotes
EXECUTIVE CHEF disputed the pace while racing three-wide, was four-wide entering the stretch then came in slightly in the final sixteenth and prevailed
narrowly. KO SAMUI (IRE) saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through entering the stretch then came out slightly in the final sixteenth and finished
fast to just miss. SMILING GOODBYE prompted the early pace set by CAPITAL EXPENSE from between horses, was three-wide entering then disputed the
pace to deep stretch before steadying slightly while in tight and held on well in a good effort. ITSALLABOUTTHERIDE was forwardly placed early while
four-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. CAPITAL EXPENSE saved ground setting the pressure pace, drifted out slightly nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and weakened. BOSS OF THEMOSS was allowed to settle while racing two-wide but lacked a rally when asked. DUTTON stumbled
at the start then dropped back and failed to menace. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE ACTIONS OF THE TOP THREE
FINISHERS BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.
