Footnotes
SHAME ON YOU set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and held safely under mild urging. ZAPPIN pressed the pace, fell back on the turn, was
steadied near the eighth pole and just lasted for place. MOTORING IN FRONT lagged early, rallied around the turn, went widest in the drive, closed well late
and was outnodded to just miss for second. K P BLAMENGAME bumped at the start, pressed the pace along the inside, fell back on the turn, shifted out,
bid and came up empty. GOGETEMGRACIE bobbled at the start, was in tight on the turn and lacked a bid. HAZHONI bumped at the start, was in tight on
the turn and lacked a response. MUSAITERS PRIDE showed speed to the turn and stopped.

second turn for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. HORNS N HALOS vied two across, fell back into the second turn, was no match late and all
out for place. GRIFTER rallied along the inside entering the second turn, angled out, bid willingly, shifted back inside, didn't have enough left and settled for
show. AX'S BOUNCY CAT set a pressured pace, tired into the second turn and stopped. KING BRYCE was through early, eased and walked off. CHARLIE

Footnotes
DANJERUS STORM raced in the second flight, rallied on the turn, challenged three across, dueled through the stretch and inched away late to prove best.
ATTILA'S ACE raced mid pack towards the outside, swung wide leaving the turn, closed willingly, was gaining late and got up near the wire for place. WALL
STREET LOGIC bumped at the start, pressed the pace, challenged on the turn, dueled through the stretch and yielded in the final strides. NOGAL
CANYON was slow early, raced outside, closed steadily and was gaining late. PLAYING FIELD bumped at the start, stalked the pace along the inside, bid
and hung. BORNINASMALLTOWN was sent to the front, set a pressured pace to the turn and flattened out. BEACH STORM was not a factor. SWAYEM
was outrun. MIST N SEVEN was vanned off.

Footnotes
LET HIM BE pressed the pace, assumed command on the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely uinder mild urging. STILL IN THE TRAP raced
close to the pace, swung wide entering the stretch, closed willingly and was no match for the winner. CORRINA CORRINA broke slowly, was taken outside,
advanced to the turn, angled in, bid and hung. HOLLYWOOD HENRY brushed at the start, set the pace to the turn, tired and gave way. DIABOLICAL FIRE
dropped inside, stalked the pace, bid and came up empty. RISKY REVENGE was not a factor. WHERES BRAYDEN broke out and brushed at the start,
saved ground and lacked a response. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO
TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.
