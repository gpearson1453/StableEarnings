Footnotes
MUCH BETTER slow early rallied out of the turn splitting horses along the inside drawing clear. SIR AGGRAVATOR pressed the pace dueling into upper
stretch extending between horses ceding to inside pressure. GENIUS chased the pace pressing on the turn wresting a short lead near mid track in upper
stretch weakening late. ONE EYED JACK raced evenly moving six wide down the lane putting in a mild bid. AWESOME OX pressed the pace dueling on
the turn weakening along the inside the final eighth. JOSHY JAK pressed the pace dueling on the turn weakening in upper stretch. MACHO SMOKE a step
slow early played no factor. FAHRENHEIT flashed early speed then faded on the turn. YOU ARE AWESOME was always outrun.
