pacesetters, drove four wide at the head of the lane, launched an all out bid but was unable to reach the eventual winner. SPEEDY PIEDY contested the
pace from between foes, chased in the final turn and came up empty in the stretch. MARINE MAGIC pressed the pace from the two path, and tired.
JOKERSRWILD AGAIN contended pace from rail and was done early.

HALLISAR contested the early pace leaving the chute, saved ground while showing the way, was kept under handling through the stretch and remained
clear. LAST OF WAR raced five wide entering the backstretch, stalked the pace while three to four wide, went in pursuit of the leader in the final turn, was all
out through the stretch but was unable to stall the winner. MOUNT LOKI trailed early, swung out at the head of the lane, and closed gradually. NIGHTFALL
raced in traffic leaving the backstretch, and passed a tiring foe in the stretch. RUN ROSSCO RUN sat just off the pace from the rail, lodged a mild bid
entering the lane and came up empty in the drive. STAY OUTA MY WAY tracked five wide, and was through early.

EXAMINER was reserved off the pace, sat in striking position then was roused at the quarter pole setting his sights on DON'T STOP DREAMIN, swept the
lead and won going away. DON'T STOP DREAMIN broke alertly to set the early pace while under a snug hold, was under attack into the stretch but was no
match for the winner. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS sat in striking range while three wide, and bid gradually late. JOKER MATT tracked the pace while four
wide, and faded gradually. DELIRIUM chased wide, and tired. BROWNING ISLAND raced five wide leaving the backstretch, and lacked a closing response.
FLASHIN ACES trailed throughout.

NIGHT FLYER sat in range while under a snug hold, swung out in the final turn, lodged a bid into the stretch, rallied under a strong hand ride and won
driving. EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE showed the way through the backstretch, responded to a challenge from HENRY'S GAMBLE, and gave way grudgingly
deep stretch. PRANCE sat mid pack while three wide, and was outkicked. TALKATIVE bid belatedly. HENRY'S GAMBLE stalked four wide, went in pursuit
of the leader, and came up empty in the drive. JOY IN GRACE trailed the field early, bid into the lane and faded. ADDYDIDIT tracked four wide, and tired
early. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SAXON SAGA set the pace from just off the rail, was under attack nearing the final turn, rallied inside of KEEN FLATTER, and just held on after a long hard
drive. KEEN FLATTER raced five wide leaving the opening turn, sat in striking range through the backstretch, challenged the front while three wide in the far
turn, rallied determinedly outside through the stretch, dug in, in the final yards but lost the bob. PARKING PERMIT was unhurried four wide through the
opening turn, was roused entering the stretch, closed gradually and was along in time for show honours. EL NOBLE hurried away, sat just outside the pace
from the three path, moved up between rivals in the final turn to challenge the front, battled into the stretch, and gave way grudgingly in the final yards. H K
RAPPER raced three wide into the first turn, shifted inside nearing the stretch, and lacked a rally. ATTENZIONE offered a late rally. A MAN'S MAN raced
wide, chased the pacesetters leaving the backstretch, and faded gradually. MOUNT ASGARD chased inside and finished evenly. AL REICHERT tracked
inside early, encountered traffic entering the stretch and faded. ALL RUN lost contact with the field early and was never involved.
