Footnotes
SILENT TRIBUTE closed in to bid between horses at the half, pulled her rider to the lead outside by the quarter pole, was set down at the furlong marker
and put away all rivals through the stretch drive. APRIL DE VELP tracked in the second flight with runners on both sides, waited behind the front trio around
the turn, smartly burst between horses in mid-stretch and ran on gamely to best the rest in the end. TIVALI was unhurried to trail down the backside,
continued to see the field going around the oval, started to extend her stride five wide turning for home, found more switching leads at the eighth pole and
closed in to capture third money at the wire. HOBBIE CLASS prompted three deep at the half, hounded the leaders three wide around the bend, was in the
mix up top in the four path at the top of the lane, could not find more late and was one paced to the wire. TIME TO WATCH had the lead early on, was
collared outside five sixteenths from the prize, fought on running inside until the furlong pole and yielded in deep stretch. MY ASSISTANT was situated three
deep outside foes in the second flight down the back straight, closed the gap four wide midturn while still in hand, lost its path coming up to the furlong
marker between rivals, was checked, switched outside but could not rally to threaten at the finish line. WAR'S END KISS was roused on the rail to improve
position down the backside, sat behind the pacesetter by the half, could not go on with others making a move at the three eighths marker and folded in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
FRIENDLY GHOST ran between horses in mid-pack down the backside, was nudged to go after the frontrunners at the quarter pole, split rivals smartly
going to the lead in the two path at the furlong marker and drew off in the late stages of the race. OSCARSSON travelled outside horses in midfield, was
forced out five wide going around the early leader who was having trouble navigating the turn at the five sixteenths marker, posed a threat in the five path at
the top of the lane and finished up a good second considering losing ground around the bend. SUMMER BUCK stalked near the rear on the outside, made a
good move closing the gap on the leaders at the quarter pole, loomed four wide in upper stretch, could not threaten the top two to the wire but did finish up
to close in and capture third money. BEE ME settled on the fence behind the pacesetter at the half, assumed the lead midturn slipping inside of the rival who
was getting out, was clinging onto the lead inside with rivals challenging at the furlong marker, could not go on and faded in the final seventy yards. RAPID
GREY pressed the pace outside in the early going, bid for the lead in the two path outside at the quarter pole, was checked when in tight between runners
driving to the wire nearing the eighth pole and was not persevered with to the finish line. AWMIK SIDE OF TOWN broke a step slow to begin, was allowed to
gather himself along the backside and around the bend, could not get involved down the lane but did pass the troubled foe in the stretch.
BACKONTHECHAINGANG took control from the onset leading down the back straight, started to bear out at the three furlong marker, continued to get out
throughout the turn to be in the seven path at the top of the lane and had nothing to show in the stretch running. STEWRADS INQUIRY REGARDING THE
#3 FRIENDLY GHOST AND #7 SUMMER BUCK IN THE STRETCH RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
YOU BE THE JUDGE tracked outside in the second flight, moved in to battle three wide outside foes midway around the bend, angled out to the four path
straightening out for home and tenaciously wore down the lead rival in the shadow of the wire for the win. CURRENT AFFAIR was content to track the loose
leader in the early stages of the race, bid for the lead with rivals on either side midpoint on the turn, had a slim advantage in the two path turning for home,
stubbornly fought on to the wire but just missed holding off the winner late. GENIUS OF LOVE travelled on the fence in mid-division, going comfortably
down the backstretch, waited to move while two wide behind the embattled trio at the quarter pole, shifted inwards to the rail for the stretch drive, posed a
threat in upper stretch but was out finished by the top two in deep stretch. SILENT AND SINFUL stalked outside foes near the rear down the back straight,
was roused with five sixteenths remaining making little advance, was in range of the leaders in the five path turning for home but finished up only evenly for
a minor share in the end. ZEENA SWIFT was void of early speed to trail along the backside, continued at the back of the pack through the turn and could
not get into contention driving to the finish line. TENTOMIDNIGHT seized the lead from the start, was headed outside by two rivals midway on the turn,
could not keep pace and emptied out on the fence at the top of the lane.

LIVE LUCKY settled stalking mid-pack off the rail, shifted in a bit on the turn saving some ground advancing inside near the rail about the five-sixteenths,
came once in upper stretch seeking room, took aim four wide, struck the lead in mid-stretch past the furlong marker and drove clear. READY TO COLLECT
had the early lead then was forced to vie inside a rival through the turn and into upper stretch, took a narrow lead briefly but was soon overtaken, had no
extra and lost place late. ITS JUST MONEY was forced in at the start then allowed to settle into stride bringing up the rear inside, advanced on the turn
saving ground, angled four wide coming to the quarter pole then swung out further to be seven deep in upper stretch, gained mildly to get up for show
honors. CLIVE CROSS settled outside a foe and off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, angled six wide in upper stretch, rallied between foes but
fell short. UNSTABLE STORM was taken back off the leading pair and switched outside those stalking into the turn and racing three to four wide, floated out
a bit further for the drive and within striking distance but could only kick on evenly late. SEHR SCHOEN prompted the pace from outside, weakened.
GOLDEN WIND broke inwardly, saved ground inside on the turn, failed to rally. PROFESORRIDESAGAIN settled off the leaders about mid-pack and racing
removed from the fence, was never near enough to threaten. SILVER PISTOL came in at the start bothering the inside rival, raced outside that one at the
back, floated wide turning for home, failed to rally.

Footnotes
STITCHES fought up front inside in the early going, was reined back at the half, closed in outside to re-engage for the lead by the quarter pole, fought up
top three wide in upper stretch, laid in even though encouraged left handed running on the wrong lead at the furlong marker, switched leads late with a
sixteenth to run and drew away on the rail when crossing the finish line. KOKOMO dueled for the lead outside at the start, improved the advantage by the
half, was headed outside by the winner at the quarter pole, battled on the rail down the lane, was steadied sharply at the sixteenth pole, angled outside late
and chased the winner home. LUCKY GUEST was reluctant to load prior to the start, stalked near the back four deep after the break, improved down the
backstretch to track the contesting duo three wide around the turn, took closer order to be in the thick of things up front in the four path straightening out for
home, could not match strides with the embattled leaders with a furlong to go and finished up a clear but non-threatening third. WAGSTAFF settled in
midfield on the backside, was urged right handed with five sixteenths from the wire, angled out to the five path turning for home, stayed on the wrong lead in
the stretch and mildly finished up to settle on the fringes in the end. WAR LEGEND tracked the top two inside in the beginning, had to be throttled down
losing positions on the rail at the half, was asked for more midway on the turn, offered little response and could not gain in the stretch travelling on the fence.
DROP YOUR GLOVES stalked near the rear between rivals in the early stages, made little improvement running through the turn and could not get involved
in the stretch drive. HUNDRED PERCENT was off a bit slow to begin, trailed runners down the backside and lost touch with the field around the turn.

Footnotes
LIFE IS HARD broke out just a bit, tucked in settling mid-pack along the inside, was encouraged along three furlongs from home still saving ground, angled
out four wide turning for home, took aim and after a prolonged drive took over seventy yards out and edged away. REPEAT THE HEAT got away well,
immediately moved clear and shifted in to about the two to three path heading to the first turn and was geared down under rating tactics and ceding the
lead, was content to lead the rest in pursuit of the new leader, gained on that one taking over past the five-sixteenths, was clear into upper stretch, collared
seventy yards out and second best. JIM'S HOPE was bumped lightly at the start, caught four wide through the first turn, made a mild advance outside
midway up the backstretch five to six wide, settled again thereafter but racing wide still through the far turn, kept on in the stretch but needed more. SILENT
SKY was three wide heading into the first turn then eased back content to stalk, continued in close pursuit on the far turn off the inside about four wide and
went evenly in the lane. MIGHTY SEA bumped a rival lightly at the start, was four wide between foes into the first turn and quickly sped clear from the
seven-eighths, set the pace up the backstretch, was overtaken midway on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. WINSTON BLUE was well-placed but
caught five wide into the first turn managing to shift in a bit later on that bend, stalked up the backstretch three or four deep, came out a bit for the stretch
run, failed to rally. ALWAYS A WAY settled well back inside, moved out off the rail, failed to threaten. CORNWALL was caught three to four wide on the first
turn, made a brief and mild early advance up the backstretch four to five wide, dropped back retreating to the back through the far turn, was not persevered
with in the stretch, walked off. WIN D'ORO was in a bit tight at the start, raced two to three wide early, pulled up on the far turn, was transported off of the
track via equine ambulance.

LAST AMERICAN EXIT was nestled on the rail watching the front three down the backstretch , shifted outside two to three wide measuring the contesting
pair through the turn, moved in to be a menacing presence in the four path turning for home and caught the softened up early leaders at the sixteenth pole
and drew clear for the score at the finish line. BOSTON TEA PARTY travelled in midfield outside horses along the backside, kept pace around the bend,
shifted out reaching for more ground five wide at the top of the lane and rallied smartly outside to garner the place share at the wire. SOCIETY'S THUNDER
stalked on the rail having a couple of runners beaten down the backside, maintained position on the turn, was encouraged right-handed in upper stretch,
weaved through traffic to the wire and with a solid effort closed in to be third at the line. JAZZ HANDS pressed the pace scenario outside four furlongs from
home, was outside dueling for the lead under quick fractions through the turn, put away the pace rival in the stretch but had nothing more to offer late and
faded at the seventy yard pole. LIGHT THE LAMP broke sharp to be up front early on, was then reined back off the speed duel by the half, tracked the
contesting pair all alone running around the bend, was asked left-handed in the three path at the top of the lane, had clear run but lacked a bid through the
stretch. AIM FOR THE SKY emerged between runners to have a narrow lead at the half, battled inside setting a brisk pace through the turn, could not find
more late and wilted in the final seventy yards. SOUPER WATSON stalked near the back of the pack in the early stages, made little headway on the oval
and was gaining while making only slight impact down the stretch. POSEIDON STEEL was allowed to gather himself trailing down the backside, continued
at the rear through the turn and did not improve position down the stretch but closed the gap considerably at the finish line.

MY BOY PRINCE broke outwardly crowding or lightly brushing a rival, recovered well and forced the pace from between runners moving soon definite
advantage after the opening quarter, began to edge away late on the turn, was asked for more at the top of the stretch and responded, spurted clear then
held safe while being kept to the task. ESSEX SERPENT broke awkwardly and slowly, settled at the rear near the inside, advanced two wide on the turn,
kept on inside in the stretch to get the nod for place over. NO MORE OPTIONS , who was forced out a bit at the start, settled off the leaders, went five then
six wide on the turn, ran on well widest but missed place. WESTERN WHIRL pressed briefly inside, eased back off the leaders and switched out, was ridden
along three wide on the turn, ran on in the lane but needed more. JUNIOR HOT SHOT raced off the early pace, advanced outside a rival four wide on the
turn, went evenly in the stretch. ROSCAR was outpaced early racing off the rail, passed tired foes. BABBO stalked then pressed the winner from outside
racing mostly three to four wide on the turn, came up empty in the stretch. HIGHLAND BLUE contended early pressing from between then inside, soon
dropped back and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
SPEEDY HANS was unhurried to trail along the backstretch, started to make a move circling three wide around horses three furlongs from the wire, bid five
wide at the top of the lane and finished up determinedly outside rivals to get up in deep stretch. BLACKTECA vied for the lead inside early on, put away the
other pace foe with five sixteenths left to run, opened up mildly in upper stretch but was ran down by the winner in the final seventy yards. DETERMINED
FURY had a good spot outside tracking the front duo, closed in three wide on the turn, bid three wide turning for home, drifted out slightly in upper stretch
when switching leads, dueled with the eventual winner to his outside at the eighth pole but was out finished to settle for third money. BLAME J D watched
the top pair between foes along the backside at the half, could not match strides with others around the turn to be shuffled back a few positions, angled out
five wide for the drive and finished up to garner a minor share in the end. TRUEBELIEVE pressed the pace outside down the back straight, could not stay
with the frontrunner by midturn, chased willingly inside down the stretch but faded late on the rail losing a placing. SHADY EMPIRE shifted in nearing the
half to improve position on the fence down the backstretch, made a brief run from the three eighths marker until the quarter pole and flattened out on the
fence in the final furlong. PERFECT MUNNINGS was checked when losing its path on the rail nearing the half, trailed afterwards, lost contact with the field
through the turn and galloped across the finish line. HALLIE'S HERO stalked near the back, having one foe beaten down the backside, improved inside
three furlongs out, shifted out four wide at the quarter pole, was in tight four wide in upper stretch, clipped heels, fell, dislodging the rider and was
transported off the track via equine ambulance.STEWARDS INQUIRY IN THE STRETCH INVOLVING #4 HALIES HERO AND #8 DETERMINED FURY
