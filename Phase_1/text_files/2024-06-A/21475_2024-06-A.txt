inside on the far turn, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, drew off under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, was given two pops of a
right-handed crop near the furlong marker, widened under a solid hand-ride into the final sixteenth then was eased up while much the best. PUJOL was
restless in the gate, bumped with a rival at the start then brushed with another foe, went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the front, came under

on the outside, chased in the two path on the far turn and tired. DANGEROUS DRIVER broke in at the start, was fanned out some into the first turn, went six
then five wide on that bend, moved up on the far outside early on the backstretch, was roused in the the two path on the final turn and came up empty.

along in the two path on the far turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. LCGOLUCKY brushed with a rival early, spun three wide into
the first turn then dropped to the rail, was rated towards the front, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was urged inside on the far turn, came out into the
stretch and weakened. COMANCHE PEAK (GB) broke a bit slow, lost his footing and stumbled some while fanned out into the first turn, dropped from the
eight path to the six path on that bend, moved up quickly early on the backstretch, raced towards the front, chased three wide on the far turn, came four
wide into the stretch and capitulated. HOURS IN A DAY bumped soundly with a rival at the start, was taken under tight restraint early, went two to three
wide on the turns and faltered then was not urged in the final furlong. BOOKWORM bumped with an opponent at the start, was taken in hand early, went

STUDLYDORIGHT bobbled at the break and recovered outwards forcing DEW to be taken hold of slightly, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out under a left handed crop from the three-sixteenths to the eighth pole, then got
corrected with a right handed crop while closing well to collar the leader inside the final seventy yards, then prevailed edging away at the end. TOUCHY
coaxed from the gate, vied among a quartet and then a trio from the four path before emerging with sole command inside the half mile pole, tucked three
wide at the seven-sixteenths forcing SHOOT THE NICKEL to be taken in hand briefly behind, tucked to the two path midway, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole and went seven to eighth wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat to the inside and got directed in by the left rein five paths to
nearly put the squeeze on THREE ECHOES near the sixteenth marker, then got caught in the late stages and forced to settle for the place honors when
running on to the end. THREE ECHOES broke in at the start bumping and squeezing back BRERETON'S BAYTOWN against DOMINICAN THUNDER,
vied from the two path among a quartet and then a trio before being shaken off at the half mile pole, chased two then three wide through the turn before
tipping four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive threatening a furlong out and was placed in tight near the sixteenth marker when TOUCHY
came in to look him in the eye, kept on to preserve the show honors on the wire. CLASSIC OF COURSE hustled from the gate, vied early and briefly from
the five path before chasing four wide into and through the turn, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and weakened. BRERETON'S BAYTOWN got
bumped at the start by THREE ECHOES and was squeezed out against DOMINICAN THUNDER, chased five then three wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild belated bid. DEW broke a half a beat slow and was taken in hand briefly
when STUDLYDORIGHT took over his lane, chased just off the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. DOMINICAN THUNDER got bumped at the start by BRERETON'S BAYTOWN due to pressure from THREE ECHOES, chased three then
two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and made no impact. SHOOT THE NICKEL hustled from the start, vied three wide
between foes among a quartet and then a trio, began to get shaken off at half a mile from home and was steadied at the seven-sixteenths when TOUCHY
tucked in front, retreated through the latter portion of the turn and took the inside route into upper stretch, then faltered in the drive. There was a Stewards'
Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on TOUCHY and THREE ECHOES near the sixteenth marker. After review, the result was allowed to stand prior to the
race being declared official.

Footnotes
CALDO CANDY showed speed and went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, shook clear along the rail early on the turn, responded well
when asked near the quarter-pole, drew off under a drive into the final sixteenth, shied out late and proved much the best under steady handling. TOSCANO
broke out at the start, pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and earned the place while no
match for the winner. SILVER SATIN broke out and hit the gate then bumped with a foe, angled in then raced just off the pace, was asked while three then
four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and also proved no match then missed the place
but earned the show. LAND D'ORO bumped with a rival at the start, bumped with foes on both sides early then checked and dropped back, moved from the
two path to the rail early on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and improved position. BRICK AMBUSH settled under some urging, moved from the two
path to the four path on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. STOP THE SPREAD was sent from the gate then well placed off the
pace, went around the the turn in the two path under urging and came up empty. B D SAINTS was jostled in the hindquarters early, raced on the outside
under urging, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond. CAMM' DUKE was bumped at the start and forced into another rival, bumped with a foe
early, was urged off the pace, dropped back four then five wide on the turn and faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
ALMOSTGONE ROCKET bobbled at the break, raced three wide in closest pursuit early on before advancing to knock heads briefly and then seizing
narrow command inside the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home, drew clear under a drive to prevail.
MANAMA GOLD got away a bit awkward and stumbled inwards at the start conceding two lengths to the front, chased four then three wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on despite drifting out two to three paths
through to the finish. GRAY LIGHTNING established the front from the get go and showed the way just off the inside in the early stages before coming
under challenge near the half mile pole, got headed inside that station and tucked inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the
inside route into upper stretch, remained prominent to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late going. BECKY'S JOKER chased along the inside under
coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, tired. DOROTHY'S DREAMS stumbled badly at the start conceding three to four
lengths to the front, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch detached at the tail of the field, tucked inside through the turn and came under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
STRICTLY TABOO was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, rallied along the rail to make a bid inside the furlong marker, gained the
advantage near the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under good handling. HEART OF THE NIGHT was hustled from the gate, chased the dueling leaders on
the outside then three wide on the turn, moved closer into upper stretch, made a bid inside the furlong marker, battled on near even terms for the advantage
into the final sixteenth but was outfinished while able to hold the place. SUMMER WHIRL bumped with a rival at the start then dropped back, was urged
along at the rear, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, angled inward in upper stretch and finished with good energy to just get the show.
BEAUTIFUL THIEF was hustled from the gate, dueled on the outside, vied in the three then four path on the turn, led from before the quarter-pole to near
the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken and just lost the show. CERRETTA was urged along on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, came five
wide into the stretch, held a good striking position into the final furlong but lacked the needed kick late. LONCHURA was urged along off the pace, came
under stronger encouragement while inside to the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SPIRIT OF ESTHER was
backed out of the gate then reloaded, bumped with a rival at the start, settled towards the rear, steadied some while in tight between horses leaving the
backstretch, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. IN THE END was hustled from the
gate, dueled on the inside of a foe, brushed with that rival leaving the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back into the final furlong and
tired. MAGNOLIA WIND was fractious in the gate, broke out at the start, settled towards the back, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and was
no factor. HARMONYVILLE was fractious in the gate, dropped back then was urged along near the rear, rounded the turn in the two path and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
WAYS AND MEANS broke awkwardly and lost her footing then bumped with a foe, was away with the rest of the field, settled on the outside, moved closer
near the nine-sixteenths, ranged up three wide on the turn, took over into the stretch then kicked clear under a solid hand ride, widened under a continued
solid hand-ride until about seventy yards from the finish then was eased up while much the best. STRIKER HAS DIAL was hustled to the front, went around
the first turn in the two path, dropped in entering the backstretch, vied inside while asked on the far turn, lost the advantage into the stretch and proved no
match for the winner while well clear for the place. MIZ SENSE broke a bit slow, saved ground on the first turn, settled under some urging, moved from the
rail to the three path on the far turn and earned the show while no threat to the top two. DO GOODER steadied some while tight against the rail early on the
first turn, checked later on that bend, was rated just off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths pole then driven three
wide into the stretch and came up empty. SARIR broke in and hit the gate, went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside under some
coaxing, chased in the two path on the far turn, dropped back late on that bend and had nothing left. BRODERIE went four wide on the first turn, settled
near the middle of the field, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. DOT MARIE bumped with foes
on both sides and was off a step slow, raced in the three path on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the final turn and
failed to respond. OBRIGADA bumped with a rival at the start, went six wide on the first turn, was urged along on the outside, dropped back four then five
wide on the turn and faltered.

WHATINTHELITERAL was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, dueled gamely while shoulder to
shoulder with the runner-up in the stretch and gamely prevailed. AORAKI pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, dueled outside of
the winner while rubbing saddles in the stretch and was denied while able to get the place. FRENCH HORN was urged along off the pace, raced inside for
most of the turn, moved to the two then three path late on that bend, pursued the top two while in good striking range in the stretch and willingly earned the
show. BAYTOWN BUTTERFLY broke awkwardly then bumped with foe, bumped with an opponent early then dropped back, angled in at the rear, saved
ground on the turn, hugged the rail into the stretch then moved out, bumped with a foe nearing the furlong marker and failed to threaten. WEST MEMORIAL
bumped with a rival early, was urged along between horses, went around the turn in the two path and tired. BISCUITWITHTHEBOSS bumped twice with
foes early then was taken in hand between horses, settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, raced three then four wide on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. THE QUEENS M G bumped with a rival at the start, bumped again with that foe early, was coaxed
along on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch, bumped with foes nearing the furlong marker and capitulated.

Footnotes
THE GREY WIZARD (IRE) settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, remained patiently handled through the first three turns, tipped out to be four
paths off the rail down the backstretch the final time before tucking back to the two path through the final turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
was set down spinning four to five wide into upper stretch, tipped out two paths as SIX MINUS did so to his inside and offered up a good finish to close
stoutly inside the final sixteenth to get up in the last jumps and prevail. CHAMPAGNE JUAN settled just off the inside tracking the front from mid pack, had
the field spread out the final time down the backstretch and advanced to inherit the front from the former leader, shook away to a safe lead into the turn
tucked inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat to the outside, bobbled twice
inside the final sixteenth and gamely fended off LIMITED LIABILITY to the finish but was nailed in the last strides to the wire and forced to settle for the
place honors, then got pulled up after the finish in the gallop out down the backstretch and was subsequently transported off of the track via equine
ambulance. LIMITED LIABILITY tracked just off the inside from just off the pace, tipped to the four path down the backstretch when the leader backed away
at the seven-sixteenths, tucked back to be two wide through the final turn, got let out swinging three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive threatening
through the final furlong between foes and missed at the end. REALLY GOOD saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. SIX MINUS two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear, bid at the
three-eights aided by the field condensing a bit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went four wide into upper stretch before tipping out two paths
straightened away and stayed on one paced to the finish. PIONEERING SPIRIT was off heels of SISKANY into the first turn and got taken hold of, chased
two to three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and stayed on one paced to the end. SISKANY (GB)
tracked the front from just off the pace two to three wide, came under a drive with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.
CIBOLIAN tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper stretch and faltered. LUCKY
CURLIN raced two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and faded, took the inside route into upper stretch,
folded and was eased home to the finish. SO HIGH (GB) cut the pace from the two path through swift splits under close company from the aforementioned
foe to the outside, succumbed on the front with seven-sixteenths to go and retreated through the final turn, went four wide into upper stretch and gave way,
then got eased home to the end. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and is utilizing GMAX timing to arrive at the most accurate times.
