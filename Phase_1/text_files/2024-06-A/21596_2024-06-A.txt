Footnotes
MIDNIGHT HALO was unhurried early, raced in the back towards the outside, rallied around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed willingly, got
up late and drew clear. TEMPLE OF PEACE raced mid pack, rallied around the turn, went eight wide entering the stretch, bid willingly to contend and was
outclosed to finish second best. MO CAN DO broke slowly, was never far back, angled in at the top of the stretch, bid off the rail, was in tight and exchanged
bumps and finished gamely to earn show. HUDSON'S DAY was getting out on the first turn, trailed the field while saving ground, went widest in the drive
and found his best stride late. JAYDE'S BANDIT was sent to the front to set the pace to mid stretch and was unable to sustain his bid. CAPTIVATING STAR
raced close to the pace towards the outside, rallied four wide into the second turn, bid and came up empty. SUNNY SASSICAIA pressed the pace, stopped
in the drive and was taken up. RUNNER RUNNER stalked the pace along the rail, was steadied entering the second turn, fell back, came again, was in
tight, bumped and checked mid stretch and dropped back. The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning possible interference in the stretch drive. No change
was made.

Footnotes
GOLD MERRITT set a pressured pace, drew clear leaving the turn and held safely while kept to task. SLITHER pressed the pace four wide to the turn, fell
back, continued willingly to the wire, narrowed the gap and held for place. MCLEAN was crowded and steadied at the start, rallied around the turn, bid
seven wide and closed well. OVERDELIVER saved ground to the turn, angled out for the drive and finished well. RISKTAKER pressed the pace, bid off the
rail and came up empty late. SUN SQUALL broke out, was never far off the pace in an outside trip and lacked a bid. HIS GIANT broke out, pressed the pace
along the rail, fell back and stopped.

Footnotes
WELCOMETOARKANSAS pressed the pace to the second turn, assumed command, drew off for a clear lead and held well in a driving finish. DYNAMIC
MOON was unhurried early, saved ground, rallied between horses into the second turn, closed willingly, shifted in late and was gaining ground. WATCH
THE COAST raced close to the pace, lacked the needed late response and held safely for show. BABY'S LAST DANCE ducked out at the start, raced close
to the pace, rallied five wide into the second turn, angled in, bid along the rail and came up empty late. MY UNCLE BILLY failed to threaten in an even effort.
ASTROLOGY WONOWON bumped and was crowded at the start, raced mid pack along the inside, angled out on the turn, went widest in the drive and
lacked a closing response. BLESSED BY CUPID hesitated, was shut off and steadied at the start and was not a factor. A G'S GEM bumped at the start, set
the pace while rank to the second turn, tired and stopped. PLENNIE LAFAYETTE broke slowly and was not a factor in an outside trip.

entering the turn, challenged for the lead along the rail, dueled to deep stretch, yielded and held for place. FREDDIE BY A NOSE was slow early, advanced
around the second turn, bid off the rail and finished well. KING OF CONTRABAND lagged early, angled out on the second turn, swung wide and found his
best stride late. RACY BILLE raced mid pack, rallied into the far turn to loom a threat, leveled off and fell back. LE MONSTRE RAPIDE raced close to the
pace along the inside, shifted out on the backstretch, was roused on the far turn, tired and gave way. GAME AND GORMLEY was off slowly and failed to
threaten in an even effort. BET AGAIN raced mid pack, was through early and outrun.
