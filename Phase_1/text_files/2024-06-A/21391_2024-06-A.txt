Footnotes
SMOKEN WICKED away in good order, pressed the winner from the outside, took over from that one into the stretch, kicked steadily clear in smart fashion
in a solid debut. RAYDEN AND REMI advanced to a forward position while three wide, closest late in the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive,
clearly second best. TAP THE TEQUILA void of early foot, stated a mild rally while off the inside, along for the show, no threat to the top two. LONE
WARRIOR back off the pace, lacked a closing response. LA CATRINA broke on top, set the early pace along the inside, gave way when headed by the
winner exiting the turn. MOMENT TO PREACH broke out, unseated rider.

Footnotes
COURTMAN in the second flight outside in the run up the backstretch, four wide through the turn, when moving a closer, challenged on the outside into the
lane, put a head in front when straightened for home and shook clear under firm handling. F T W SLAM also in the second group up the backstretch, three
wide and inside the winner into the turn, moved with that one to the fore entering the stretch, could not match strides upper stretch nor make up any ground
late, held sway for the place. CAJUN AMI last to leave, raced back, came five wide out of the turn, improved position a bit to annex the show. SEEHOSS in
the main body with the top two early, fell back before a quarter, raced back and three wide through the turn, shifted out widest nearing the furlong marker
and displayed some interest to improve position. REDDINGANDLEE in the second flight between rivals, fell back bit turn, angled in for the drive, went
evenly to the wire. STRONG PROSPECT void of early foot, four to five wide turning for home, lacked a closing kick. FAMILY CREED broke alertly, showed
the way up the backstretch in the three path, offered brief resistance when challenged into the lane, gave way from between foes approaching the furlong
marker. STEAUXLIT in the main body inside, squeezed through along the rail when moving closer late in the turn, gave way soon after.

SWEET ALEXIS with the pace while racing up the backstretch closest to the rail, showed the way into the lane while remaining off the inside, kicked well
clear the final furlong under steady handling. RED WHISTLE back off the pace while inside, continued to save ground when moving closer late in the turn,
chased the winner past the furlong, proved no match late, narrowly gained the nod for the place. STEPHANIE'S MARIA in the second group while off the
inside and outside for the runner, set down, long drive for the place, missed the nod. CUSTOM SUNSHINE prompted the early pace outside, five to six wide
through the turn, had little left for the stretch run. THE CALLING STONE vied early three wide and between horses, fell back off the winner while five wide
into the lane, continued to tire. MOLLI WAY fell back to trail after the start and never menaced. GEAUX MAW P vied up front while three wide, gave way in
the drive, was injured in the late going, unseated rider, vanned off.

OVA CHARGED broke with the leaders, pressed the issue up the backstretch three wide early, spurted quickly clear midway on the turn, maintained
daylight past the furlong marker, kept the next two at bay late under a firm hand ride. LUYV void of early foot, came five wide for the drive, finished with
good interest to be closing the gap on the winner late while remaining widest to the wire. NONEYA also lacked speed, came four wide and inside the runner
up into the lane, also was getting to the winner late, not enough for the place. CHARLIE T vied up front while between horses early, also lost contact with
the winner inside that one late in the turn, gradually weakened through the lane. BELEOUT chased the first flight up the backstretch and into the turn,
moved closer along the inside upper stretch, flattened out late to lose some position. FLASHY MEG broke alertly, raced with the pace closest to the inside,
began to weaken midway on the turn then stopped in the drive to trail home well back.

Footnotes
TDZSHININLUCKYSTAR settled off the pace in the early going off the inside, raced outside, swept up into contention four wide through the second turn,
engaged the leader into the lane, put that one away nearing the furlong marker, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. EL DINERO hopped
at the start to be off slowly, continued back, five wide into the lane when beginning to rally, finished willingly to annex the place. TAKE CHARGE J J void of
early foot, remained well back for six furlongs, came six wide into the stretch, lodged a belated rally to be up for the show late. SONOFASHIP dueled early
off the inside, shook clear onto the backstretch, came in a bit to put STRONG PROMISE in somewhat tight quarters into the far turn, responded when the
winner came alongside turning for home, proved no match for that one the final furlong, weakened. GAMER NATE void of early foot, fanned seven wide
turning for home, lacked a closing kick. STRONG PROMISE dueled early along the inside, allowed the leader to go early, fell back off that one onto the
backstretch, crept a bit closer along the rail into the far turn, put in tight by that same foe soon after, steadily weakened through the lane. GOOD AND
STOUT lacked speed for six furlongs, improved into the lane a bit, failed to make a significant impact late. SAINT GABRIEL settled off the pace, backed up
through the stretch. CARPIS in the second flight within striking distance while outside, gave way in the drive. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
REGARDING THE RUN INTO THE FAR TURN, SONOFASHIP WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED SEVENTH.

FOR HARPER far back early, advanced steadily while picking way through some traffic into the far turn, continued to come well wide, collared leader late,
best. NORAH G close from the start, took over from between horses in the second turn, responded when the winner came calling upper stretch, gave
ground grudgingly to that one the final furlong. WHOLELOTTAMO balked at loading, raced forwardly early off the inside, began to fade after five furlongs.
SIXTH ANNIVERSARY back off the early pace, moved into within striking distance with a three wide middle move into the far turn, weakened in the drive.
TENSAS CANDY settled off the pace inside, shuffled back along the inside far turn, improved position in the drive. BOX OF PICTURES popped stall doors
while restless in the gate, settled in the second flight outside, four wide in the second turn, had little left late. LUMINOUS FLIGHT away in good order, set
the pace along the inside, continued to show the way into the far turn, headed by the runner up soon after, gave way in the drive. SPIRITED BEAUTY in the
main body first turn in some traffic, once again encountered traffic late backstretch, moved out, failed to rally. FINAL QUEST in mid pack while racing off the
inside, had nothing left for the drive. FIRST I'VE SEEN back off the pace, fell back, always outrun.

Footnotes
LIGHTOFMAINE forwardly placed from the start, prompted the leader onto the backstretch, dueled into the far turn, disposed of that foe and held the runner
up safe through the stretch in determined fashion. TOMMIE G settled off the pace and the inside, moved closest to the winner into the stretch, could not get
to that rival despite firm handling. CLEARLY A TEST settled off the pace toward the inside, moved out, came four wide for the drive, failed to muster a late
bid. ISLAND GOLD broke out, raced four wide through the first turn when well back, continued to late, four wide again through the final turn, found best
stride too late while improving. EMILY'S BULLET went one paced throughout in lacking a winning kick. WONDERRAND lacked speed for six furlongs, came
five wide out of the final turn, displayed some mild interest down the middle of the strip to improve position somewhat. ACCOMMODATE EVA back off the
pace, moved a bit closer in the second turn then gave way in the drive. PIP SQUEEK showed the way into and through the first turn, dueled inside the
winner up the backstretch, first to blink into the far turn, continued to fade in the run to the wire.

WHO TOOK THE MONEY off a step slow, void of speed, angled out five turning for home, rallied while well out in the strip, finished full of run down the
middle of the strip to be up in time. COSMIC TRAIN allowed the pace to go early, stalked up the backstretch, outside bid, extended stretch duel, led late,
nailed by the winner in the final strides. BENOIT prompted the issue up front for five furlongs three wide, moved to challenge far turn, dueled into and
through much of the stretch, relented late, saved the show. HIGHLAND CREEK pressed the issue while off the inside, began to weaken from between
horses into the far turn, continued to fade in the drive. BLUE CHEESE void of speed, swung out to be six wide into the stretch, improved position with some
modest interest while out in the middle of the strip. BRIAN'S IRON MIKE pulled while in some traffic first turn, within striking distance middle half mile,
moved closer when asked three wide late in the final turn, weakened through the lane. WISE VERDICT rank into the first turn, continued to be slow to settle
when covered up late in that first bend, settled in the run up the backstretch, lacked a closing kick. BEHEMAH STAR raced inside while in traffic first turn,
continued to save ground up the backstretch, within striking distance into the far turn, fell back and encountered additional traffic with a quarter to run, had
little left for the drive. SONYA KNOWS BETTER showed the way along the inside, vied second turn, weakened through the stretch.

Footnotes
NOT ON HERB forwardly placed while between horses early, three wide when creeping closer late in the turn, kicked strongly clear the final furlong. CLEAR
AS A BELE off a step slow, raced back, began to advance through traffic turn, continued willingly to the finish to be up in time for the place. BERTIE'S
GALAXY behind the pace inside, got through along the inside turning for home, to improve position, nipped late for the place. SHARP CHARLIE moved up
along the inside to duel before a quarter, continued to vie far turn, could not keep up with the winner in the drive while getting out a bit, weakened a bit in the
late going to lose a couple of positions. MIKE J raced in mid pack and outside, asked along four wide midway on the turn, lacked the needed closing kick.
BLACK SWORD broke with the leaders, dueled up front in the two path, first to blink midway on the turn, continued to weaken gradually through the lane.
MANGUM void of early foot, showed some belated interest through some traffic to improve position while not a serious threat. AUTUMNS STRONG MAN
went one paced throughout in lacking a closing kick. CRAKEN JAX settled in mid pack, lacked response through the lane. WILD BERT void of speed
outside, raced six out to seven wide turning for home, remained back. HARPETH RIVER forwardly placed four three furlongs, four wide late in the turn,
stopped badly, jogged in.
