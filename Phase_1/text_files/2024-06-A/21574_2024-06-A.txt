furlong marker and edged up late. DOMINANT STRANGER unhurried, moved up three wide through the turn, angled widest into the stretch, made a steady

into the stretch, then flattened the final furlong and held a share. JULIETTE FALLS never far back, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three
wide into the stretch, drifted in and could not gain. TIZ BIZNESS well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, then faded four wide into
