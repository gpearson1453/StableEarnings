Footnotes
SHE'S A LINO sprinted clear early, was hooked on the turn then held on determinedly following a long stretch drive. RAICHU split rivals rallying on the turn,
loomed a stretch threat but could not get by the winner. BE LIKE BETH prompted the pace three wide and continued well to the finish. BOHEMIA BABE
saved ground off the pace and was always outrun. I'M NERVOUS NOW dropped back at the start and trailed losing contact with her field. A claim of foul by
the trainer of the second finisher against the winner for interference on the turn was dismissed.

HUMBLE JOE settled close up, angled out rallying into the stretch then surged clear late. PRINCE OF CHILL stalked three wide, bid to the front midway on
the turn then was outfinished in the final eighth. BIAGIO chased inside, faded on the turn then came again for the show. WHY STOP THERE led narrowly
inside, dueled through the turn and faltered. BRASI forced the pace outside then between rivals and gave way. MY BOY TULLIO dropped back outside and
was never a factor. GOLD BLING lacked speed and trailed throughout.

SALAGADOOLA settled close up inside, took over near the top of the stretch, drew clear and was being geared down late. SUMMARY JUDGMENT set
pace under rating hold in two path, was collared into the lane and tired. UNADULTERATED moved close up three wide, weakened then came again for the
show. AMATERASU reserved just off the pace between rivals and faltered. FAST MULE prompted the pace along the inside then began tiring on the final

early, was eased back after the first quarter, pursued the winner then came again just missing+-. JEEPER trailed early, swung wide on the final turn and
offered a steady late gain. BATTER UP BUD raced just off the pace, made a brief bid on the final turn then flattened out. BROOKLYN STRONG prompted
the pace three wide then faltered on the final turn. JEWELS IN THE BAY was put to urging before half a mile then gave way readily.

Footnotes
COUNTERSPY set the pace under rating, repelled challenge at the quarter pole then held on gamely under steady handling. IRISH CORK trailed for half
mile, advanced wide on the final turn and continued gamely to the finish. ADERO close up from the outset, went after the winner on the final turn then
weakened late. FAR MO POWER prompted the pace in the two path for five furlongs and faltered. MR. HUSTLE reserved off the pace, angled very wide on
the final turn and was no threat. BESTSUGARDADDYEVER saved ground close up to the final turn and faltered.

Footnotes
INSTINCTIVE reserved early, bid three wide on the final turn, took over into the stretch and drew off. MERCY MERCY was well placed behind dueling
leaders and continued willingly to hold place. CREME CARAMEL well back early, moved very wide into the stretch and closed strongly. TOMARIE prompted
the pace to the stretch and weakened slightly. ANGELIC GAL moved clear after the initial quarter then faltered in the stretch. KESTENNA (GB) trailed far
behind and was never a factor. LULINDA'S HEART gave way after the opening quarter losing contact with her field.
