FRIAR TUCK controlled the pace, repelled a challenge on the turn and remained clear in a steady drive. DIVINE MIRACLE pursued the winner throughout
and continued gamely to the finish. LIBERTY STAR saved ground off the pace, angled out in the stretch but could not gain. DATHOSS raced off the leaders
inside and proved empty in the stretch. HOTPOT chased three wide down the backstretch, made brief bid on the turn then faded. VIOLENT TURBULENCE
raced behind wall of rivals opening quarter and had no response. MY DEVILS CHILD lacked speed, swung very wide on the turn and was no factor. CHIP'S
FRIEND broke in a complete tangle losing any chance at the start. BOYS AND BULLETS raced off the pace outside and weakened steadily.
