Footnotes
BOURBON DELIGHT bumped with CAMARGO as those two vied for the lead going to the first bend, moved ahead while just off the inside on the
backstretch, drifted out badly through the lane but narrowly held on. COPPER CROSSING gradually progressed from inside, had every chance through the
stretch but did not have enough late. CHARM THE LADIES went for the lead three wide on the second turn, came into the stretch just behind BOURBON
DELIGHT, was gradually forced out as the latter came out, altered in with a sixteenth left and also came up short. KEEN RESPONSE well back early,
picked up his pace after a half mile, progressed just off the inside on the second turn, had a striking position with a furlong left but finished evenly.
LASTFORTINOFAMILY chased from outside, saved ground taking the second bend then flattened out the furlong. JOEY B crowded briefly at the break,
gradually progressed widest to reach contention four wide on the second turn but gave way for the drive. CAMARGO bumped with BOURBON DELIGHT
going to the first turn, vied for the lead briefly outside the latter but began to fade before finishing a half mile. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY
OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

Footnotes
LILY'S WOOFY shared the early lead between rivals, moved clear when allowed on the bend then widened command while drifting out the final eighth.
WAR COLORS forced in just after the break, saved ground taking the turn, rallied in the lane, altered out two wide inside the last furlong and got up for
second. A REAL HERO chased from just off the inside, lost time angling out widest upper stretch and showed a willingness to run late. ORNERY ANGEL
was just off the rail on the turn, rallied into the lane to gain second along the inside but leveled off deep stretch. LIFE OF SATURDAYS raced in contention
from inside, angled out three wide on the turn then weakened between rivals the final eighth. VIVA VIOLENCE forced COOKIN ROSES inward leaving the
chute, vied for the early lead from outside, did not stay with LILY'S WOOFY on the turn and flattened out four wide in the stretch. COOKIN ROSES made a
leap from the gate then was forced inward leaving the chute, quickly recovered to vie for the early lead inside LILY'S WOOFY, retreated from close quarters
into the bend and began to yield just off the inside with two furlongs to go. SWEET NELLIE was a factor from outside, five wide on the turn then gave way
for the drive. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE
MOST ACCURATE TIME.

Footnotes
PEYTONS HONOR bumped twice at the start, prompted the pace just off the inside, rallied in the lane and drew off inside the last furlong. AIR GERRI was
bumped then forced into another at the break, vied for the early lead, moved clear nearing the end of two furlongs, took the rail into the turn, did not have
enough left in the stretch but lasted for the place. HARPER BRIANA bumped leaving the chute, raced in contention between horses, angled out some into
the turn, lost ground four to six wide through the bend, had a striking position outside rivals with a furlong to go but could only catch HUCKLEBERRY
HUSTLE for third late. HUCKLEBERRY HUSTLE was away slowly, progressed just off the inside on the turn, altered out some for a clear path upper
stretch, took over third but could not sustain her bid in the waning yards. HER SPEAKER'S ON hustled early, was prominent from inside, retreated along the
rail on the turn, came again just off the inside upper stretch but leveled off the final eighth. SILVER EYES bobbled a couple strides from the gate, was an
early factor just off the rail, angled out some through the bend, was bumped and forced out some at the top of the lane and had no late bid. ZOEY ATTACK
somewhat slow at the break, as well, moved to the outside early on and was never a factor. HANABI bumped first with PEYTONS HONOR then HARPER
BRIANA, pressed the pace from outside, was three wide on the turn, drifted out entering the lane, bumped SILVER EYES, was corrected then steadily
faded between foes. SKIP TO BALI chased from well off the inside, angled in some leaving the turn and had little to offer for the drive.

Footnotes
BASEBALL POLITICS was rated on the front end just outside TROY OUNCE, put to urging upper stretch and proved much the best ridden out. TONYS
MORNING LINE without early speed, picked up his pace along the rail on the bend, swung out some entering the lane, altered outside ONE PUTT RICHIE
inside the last eighth and caught the latter for second in the waning yards. ONE PUTT RICHIE chased the early speed from outside, came into the lane from
path four, took over second inside the final furlong, was outfinished but clearly best of the others. TROY OUNCE displayed early speed from inside, could
not stay with BASEBALL POLITICS upper stretch and flattened out in the late going. BLAZEN ROAD hesitated at the break, stayed off the inside, was
widest entering the lane and had no late bid. MKAR THE FAST also hesitated at the start, soon well back and always outrun.

Footnotes
OSCAR NOMINEE stalked the early speed from just outside, floated out to path four into the lane, drifted out under left-handed pressured midstretch,
lugged in when switched to right-handed urging the final sixteenth but got up in time. LATE BLACKSMITH was quickly clear of the others, floated out to path
three for the stretch run, lengthened his lead but could not sustain his bid in the late going. WIN THE CUP was a step slow and a bit awkward at the start,
commenced his bid just off the inside on the turn, lost ground fanning five wide entering the lane, steadily advanced, angled in when OSCAR NOMINEE
came out midstretch then altered outside the top pair nearing the wire. HAND OVER MY HEART raced in contention from inside but lacked the extra
needed for the stretch run. BEST MAN SPEECH was just off the inside on the turn, angled out to the middle of the track upper stretch and showed late
interest. CRAZY HEART was an early factor running outside OSCAR NOMINEE, did not stay close entering the lane and only made up minor ground the
last eighth. DOUBLE DRIBBLE chased from just off the rail, had the rail through the bend, angled out for a clear path midstretch but had no late bid.
DRINKING TOUR well back early, saved ground taking the turn and had little to offer for the stretch run. C C RITHMS unruly in the gate, hesitated then
swiped the gate as he lunged outward once the race began and was always outrun.

MAPACHE G was a step slow at the break and settled inside, roused on the turn, angled out some for a clear path at the top of the lane, rallied and drew off
inside the final sixteenth. SPANISH DOUBLOON shared the lead from between rivals, floated out some into the stretch, gradually drifted out the last furlong
but lasted for the place. GRANDDADDYLONGLEGS vied for the lead from outside, was carried out some by SPANISH DOUBLOON leaving the turn and
gradually forced out as he fought for the lead then for second the final eighth. BLUE NORTHER raced in contention just off the inside on the backstretch,
angled out four wide into the bend, fanned out further for the drive and was forced to alter out some deep stretch as he closed in on second late. DRAMA
CRITIC moved to the outside early on, lost ground staying wide through the turn and flattened out for the stretch run. XPRESSIR displayed early speed from
inside but gave way for the drive.

FEROCITY prominent between rivals, was two wide on the turn, fanned out some entering the lane, rallied the last furlong, gradually angled out to stay clear
of MY LITTLE TIPSY inside the final furlong, took over with seventy yards to go and was drawing off nearing the wire. MY LITTLE TIPSY was sent to
contest the early pace, moved clear nearing the end of a quarter mile, saved ground and began to drift out as he wore down the last furlong. AVENGING
WARRIOR a step slow at the break, soon trailed, was just off the inside taking the bend, angled out five wide at the top of the lane, altered in for a clear path
nearing the eighth pole, rallied belatedly but edged ahead for third in time. NOT AGAIN JACKIE raced in midpack from outside, advanced four wide on the
turn, lost further ground swinging out to path six for the drive, fought for third as he closed the gap on the top pair deep stretch but did not have enough in
the waning yards. WINDIGO SPIRIT well placed inside on the backstretch, retreated on the bend and lacked a significant stretch response. STOSH chased
from outside, was widest through the turn and showed a willingness to run the last furlong. I'M YOUR VALENTINE hesitated at the start, chased from
between horses, was in path three on the turn, swung out seven wide for the stretch run and also showed belated interest in the late going. AFRICAN
WARRIOR prompted the pace from outside, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out.
