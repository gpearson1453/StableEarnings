TRAINER PLEASE was well placed early, made a two wide bid by the quarter pole and went on even terms leaving the turn and hit the front by the furlong
marker and was clear by the sixteenth marker and then held off his barn mate late under right handed crop urging. HARBOR OF GOLD was well rated early
on the insider, moved out and came three wide off the turn and closed well but could not get to the winner, too late. HYPER INFLATION was settled on the
inside, came two wide off the turn and had a mild late rally to gain the show award late. ONE TRUTH was bumped at the start and then went up to set the
pace on the inside, was headed leaving the turn and faded in the final furlong, lost show award late. CITIZEN MACK was settled early and eaced two to
three wide on the turn and had no rally. RAISEDAROOFCHARLIE was settled back early, came five wide off the bend and had no rally. BRADY was
reserved on the inside and failed to menace. ROCKIN THE BANK prompted the pace three wide and weakened.

away in the final furlong to prove much the best under a drive. MAJOR THOMAS set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid from LA PAZ on the turn and
was clear off the turn two wide, but proved to be no match for the winner late while clearly second best. SACHMO was settled on the inside and saved
ground on the turn, moved out in the lane and was along for the show award. T REX was four wide into the first turn, chased the pace on the outside and
was four wide by the quarter pole and had no kick. SILK WAR tracked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but flattened out. LA PAZ prompted
the pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to vie for the lead but weakened. CALL ON CLARA was taken back early, five wide by the quarter pole and
came eight wide into the lane and had no rally. KITTEN AROUND was settled two to three wide, between rivals leaving the turn but had no rally. WICKED
MAD was reserved early, three wide on the far turn and was not a threat. SUGAR'S LAST HOPE chased the early pace in between rivals and stopped on

Footnotes
THE FURMANATOR was settled early on the inside, moved out to the two path on the turn, came three wide off the bend and tipped out four wide for aim
and closed well to gwet up in time under a drive. IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN chased the early pace from the outside, then advanced three wide on the turn,
came three wide off the bend and made a bid to gain a short lead very late but was nailed on the wire to just miss. TRIXIE'S TIME dueled for the early lead
two wide, made a bid to draw clear on the turn, was still clear by the furlong marker and fought on but was caught late. MY MASTERPIECE chased the pace
and was two wide on the turn but had no kick in the drive, even effort. MS MERRABEL was reserved early, three wide on the turn and had no rally. LIL H
was away alertly and dropped back and never threatened. THUNDER BOSS rushed up the inside to duel for the lead on the inside and then checked hard
entering the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
FIRE DOWN BELOW pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to take over by the quarter pole, then drew out leaving the turn and
drew off to prove much the best under right handed crop urging. GET DOWN BROWN set a pressured pace on the inside and then was headed on the turn
and moved out off the turn and proved to be no match for the winner while staying on for the place award. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY was off a step slow,
trailed early on the insider, then steadied by the seven sixteenths, split rivals nearing the three eighths marker and advanced on the inside by the quarter
pole, then ran on to best the rest. SPOOKY ONE pressed the early pace in between rivals, then fell back on the turn and came four wide off the turn and
weakened. FEDERAL CASE chased the pace on the outside and was wide on the turn and weakened. NICK THE CARDSHARK chased the pace in
between rivals four wide on the turn and dropped back. ACT OF VALOR tracked the pace three wide and weakened. COAST TO COAST chased the early
pace on the inside, then checked by the three eighths marker and dropped out. JOCKEY OBJECTION NUMBER TWO COAST TO COAST AGAINST
NUMBER THREE SHANGHAI SUPERFLY for interference at the three eighths pole, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the objection was
disallowed and then race was made official as is.

FILTHY RICH tracked the early pace from the outside, made a three wide bid on the turn, took over off the turn and drew off to prove much the best under
right handed crop urging, wrapped up very late. PENTATONIC was away alertly to set the pace and move over to the inside, then was headed off the turn
and proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. HOPPERTULLIO was reserved early, saved ground on the turn and gained the show
award in the final furlong. TEN AND CHANGE stalked the early pace two wide, then fell back and was given a reminder by the seven sixteenth and moved
to the inside, then came three wide into the lane and weakened, bested rest. HOPPY TIME was settled early, two wide on the turn, came three wide into the
lane and angled out in the drive but never threatened. IT'S SAUL GOODMAN failed to menace. THIRD CITY tracked the early pace from between rivals,
chased the pace three wide on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
DEB'S GUNFIGHTER chased the early pace on the outside, made a four wide move on the turn and continued that move off the turn and kicked away in
the final furlong to prove best under a drive. AGAINST THE ODDS pressed the pace three wide and made a bid on the turn to vie for command and was
between rivals by the furlong marker but could not go with the winner while staying on to be second best. SCREEN STAR set a pressured pace on the
inside of rivals while in the two path, then faded in the final furlong, held show award. SANTO chased the pace on the inside, eased out on the turn, came
five wide off the turn and finished willingly to just miss the show award. MYSTIC POINT tracked the pace in between rivals early, then was two wide on the
turn and had no late kick. STAR WEAVER was close up early on the inside, then weakened in the drive. JETTIN OUT broke good and then dropped back
early and moved to the outside and was five wide on the turn and never threatened. MR. PETE chased thee arly pace in between rivals and fell back on the
turn, weakened.
