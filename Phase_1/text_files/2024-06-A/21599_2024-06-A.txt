pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. TIZAWINNER raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three

four path on the far turn and settled for second best. CAJUN JOE took the lead in the three path entering the first turn then moved to the inside to show the
way, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, gave up the lead past the quarter pole and flattened off the rail on the far turn. CUCHULAIN

FULL MOON LOVER took a quick lead and rated a slim lead through the backstretch, came under pressure while saving ground into the turn, drifted
entering the stretch, lugged in under right handed urging toward mid-stretch and held on. MANAROLA pressured the pace inside, checked in tight at the rail
midway on the turn, was shut off toward mid-stretch but recovered stride quickly and finished well. CEDAR'S WISH gave chase, rounded the turn about the
three path and finished evenly while gaining on the top two. ALPINE MOON chased, rounded the turn about the four path and ran evenly in the lane.
TIMETOGETUP chased through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn, angled to the outside entering the stretch and showed little more. GHOSTLY
SQUALL gave chase toward the inside, rounded the turn near the rail and weakened in the lane. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of
Full Moon Lover for interference nearing the sixteenth pole, lodged by the rider of Manarola, which resulted in the disqualification of the former to second
place, for impeding the latter nearing mid-stretch.

later yards. KRUG raced in the six path the opening turn then stalked off the rail the second turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested at
a close disadvantage two deep while between horses on the far turn but flattened stride later yards. JUMPSTER settled off the rail, gave chase past the half
mile pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. GRAND MANNER stalked inside, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole,

toward the three eighths pole then flattened in the three path on the far turn. MISTER WINSTON raced in the seven path the opening turn, came through the

Footnotes
CURB THAT TIGER steadied soon after the start then settled off the rail, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and improved steadily, raced in the five path on
the far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and widened later yards. CALLISTO'S BRIGADE stalked from the four path the first turn, dueled for the lead
three wide nearing the five sixteenths pole and contested the edge through the far turn, was steadily handled leaving the turn, gave up the lead mid-stretch
but dug in to retain second. STRIVE FOR STRIDE saved ground close to the pace on the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn about the four path, altered course toward the outside mid-stretch and dueled for third. SWISS LEGACY rated a slim lead inside, was
met at the seven sixteenths pole and dueled to recover the advantage nearing the five sixteenths pole, remained a factor nearest the rail on the far turn but
weakened inside the sixteenth pole. MONKEY WRENCH stalked two deep then took the nod at the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at mostly even terms from
that point and contested two deep while between horses on the far turn, but dropped back approaching the head of the lane and weakened in the stretch.
SUGAR LIPS settled in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, but flattened in the six path
on the far turn. ASTRAYAL was not a factor. LAST PARTY raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole and weakened at the
rail on the far turn. BOP ZAPPER showed little response through the backstretch.
