REAL GOOD VYBZ well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain, edged ahead, and
held while drifting out under steady left hand pressure. KAGERO fractious in the gate, was unhurried early, gained position on the two path through the turn,
fanned widest into the stretch, made a steady gain, then lacked the needed late kick. SUSIE'S SAVER allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide
through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, evened out, gaining the show. ORPHAN EXCHANGE set the pace on the inside, stayed on when
challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. ZORA well placed, moved up inside through the turn, came through inside into
the stretch and had no rally. SAWEETIE GIRL stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the stretch and weakened.

LOTSANDLOTSOFGOLD well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady
gain and drove clear late. MARY KATHERINE unhurried, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch,
angled in, made a steady gain, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. DREAMFUL sprinted to
a long lead through the first turn, held sway without challenge to the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. AWARD TOUR (IRE)

Footnotes
LEONARD'S LEGACY broke out at the start, bumping a rival, sprinted clear soon after, held sway without challenge, drew off in the stretch and was kept to
the task. LITTLE BIG well placed and inside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out and held
the place. LOUISIANIMAL bumped by both sides at the start, steadied along early for racing room, held position three wide through the turn, came four wide
into the stretch and edged up for the show. AESTHETICALLY allowed to settle, angled out through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, made a steady
gain and edged up for a share. LEGIO broke in at the start, bumping a rival, exchanged bumps with that one in the early going, settling well off the pace,
moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. FLOAT AWAY rated close up and outside, gained
position four wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted in and weakened. BLUEBERRY rated close up and inside, faded through the
turn. SAILOR'S SALUTE well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, then faded into the stretch. INNUENDO was no factor,
widest. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER OF LEGIO AGAINST THE RIDER OF AESTHETICALLY FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH
WAS NOT ALLOWED
