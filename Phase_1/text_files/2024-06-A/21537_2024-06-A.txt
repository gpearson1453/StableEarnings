Footnotes
ROSE RITA sparred for the lead two wide into the turn, forged an advantage turning for home and drove clear entering the final furlong. GRACE ON
GRACE battled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but was headed with five sixteenths to go, failed to sustain the duel in midstretch and was second
best. KISS CAM stalked outside of the embattled leading pair, but only managed to chase those rivals through the lane and held show. GLAMOURCENTS
tracked two wide and between horses, then only inside of a rival while remaining a path off of the inside turning for home, shifted out to the four path in
upper stretch, chased the leaders home and needed more to bid for show. THUNDER BERN chased along the inside, gave way and yielded position to
outer rivals around the turn, yet regained stride entering the lane and kept on mildly. SEVILLA broke a step slow, lacked speed while tucking to the inside
into the turn, shifted to the three path leaving upper stretch and improved position. VOODOO PRINCESS raced off of the pace in the three to three path into
the turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane before drifting wider in upper stretch, then failed to menace. LOVEBUG tracked from the four to three path,
got floated to the five path by an inner foe in upper stretch and gave way. BAYTOWN BOUJEE broke a step slow while last away, trailed in the two path and
never got involved. EMY pursued from off of the pace in the three path and tired.

Footnotes
CORNINGSTONE tracked in the three to four path and outside of foes around the first turn, ranged up to bid along with an inner rival with nine sixteenths to
go, dueled for the lead two wide around the far turn, drew clear entering the lane and held sway under a drive. SULTRY LASS stuttered a step and was
brushed by an outer rival at the start, pursued from the rear two wide, improved between horses at the five furlong pole, tracked behind the top pair and from
the two path around the far turn, inched between horses to bid for place entering the lane, brushed with her outer counterpart chasing the clear leader in
upper stretch and edged place passing the furlong grounds. SUNNY ISLE BEACH pursued from midpack in the four to five path around the first turn, tucked
three wide in pursuit with five furlongs to go, was scrubbed upon within striking range outside of the top pair around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with
the clearing leader while vying for place with an inner rival entering the lane, brushed with that foe in upper stretch and got outkicked at the furlong grounds.
GUANA CAY was slow into stride, laid off of the pace along the inside, then two wide around the far turn and failed to factor. MYSTIC PLEASURE prompted
inside of the leader before backing off to stalk entering the backstretch, shifted out before rebidding outside of the leader along with an outer rival with nine
sixteenths to go, disposed of her inner faltering counterpart approaching the far turn before dueling with her outer competitor around that bend, but gave
way entering the lane and weakened. LIL KINGS PRINCESS brushed an inner rival at the start, led narrowly two wide early on before inching clear entering
the backstretch, but was confronted by an outer pair of challengers at the nine sixteenths pole, faltered approaching the far turn, quickly weakened and was
eased through the final furlong.

SAVE THE TREES broke a step slow, pursued off of the pace four wide, tracked five wide inching closer around the turn, ranged up to the top pair to bid at
the furlong grounds and drove clear. AL AMEEQ vied two wide and between horses, forged an advantage in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer
bidder in the final furlong and was second best. FLOTATION STATION vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, got headed whlie dueling with just a solo
outer counter part in upper stretch, but was outkicked by a wider bidder at the furlong grounds, yielded yet held show. FOR SOME REASON tracked three
wide tugging behind the leading trio early on, stalked tipping four wide and between horses into the turn, inched closer turning for home, but was outkicked
by an outer competitor in upper stretch and kept on mildly. RUNAWAY JOKE bobbled subtly at the start, stalked two wide and between horses, chased
coming under urging turning for home and lacked a bid. SPANISH WELLS prompted three deep, pressed between horses as outer rivals inched closer
turning for home, chased the top pair into the lane and gave way between horses. COPPER ECHO stalked along the inside, chased approaching the lane
and yielded. SITKA broke slowly, raced at the rear two wide, entered the lane in the three path and failed to factor. CRAFTED raced at the rear along the
inside into the turn and got outrun.

Footnotes
EMERY broke out multiple paths at the start, tracked in the five path while widest and inching closer around the turn, ranged up to bid entering the lane,
gained command when moderately let out in upper stretch, then galloped away in cruise control through the final furlong. TAMBO stalked from the four path,
moved to press the top pair with three furlongs to go, bid along with an outer well-traveling rival entering the lane, but proved no match for that one in upper
stretch and was second best. LEGADEMA stalked two wide and between horses, crept closer to prompt the pace at the three furlong pole, vied turning for
home, but got outkicked by an outer pair in upper stretch and gave way. CHARLENE'S DREAM got fractious in the starting gate, tracked along the inside,
chased around the turn then surpassed a tiring rival and failed to threaten. MOONLIT LADY stuttered a step upon leaving the gates, showed the way in the
two path, felt pressure from an outer air into the turn, got headed while inside of a trio of foes entering the lane and readily weakened.

Footnotes
MIXOLOGIST broke inwardly at the start, settled well back two wide, launched progress in the three path turning for home, spun to the four path into upper
stretch, tipped out to the six path approaching midstretch, surged to range up to the new leader leaving the sixteenth pole and inched past under confident
handling. DEEP SATIN took bumps from an outer rival early on, settled off of the pace along the inside, gained fanning to the four then five path around the
far turn, sustained a rally to bid at the furlong grounds, drove past soon after, but was caught by an outer bidder in the final sixteenth. RACONTEUSE
tracked three wide, bid two wide around the far turn, forged an advantage in upper stretch, but was surpassed by an outer bidder leaving the furlong
grounds, lost place soon after and was clear of the rest. WHAPPEN brushed with an inner rival a stride after the start, stalked along the inside, but was
shuffled back behind a faltering foe into the far turn, shfited two wide turning for home, to the three path into the lane, moved out to the five path reaching
midstretch and ran on outside of foes to gain a minor share late. SHORE WAR brushed with an outer foe soon after the start, tracked two wide and between
horses, chased around the far turn, then stayed on among foes in the closing stages to miss fourth at the wire. SARANAC LAKE settled off of the pace two
wide, took closer order to track three wide around the far turn, but chased in the four path and between horses into the final furlong and failed to menace.
MYIYLA hopped slightly and broke a step slow before being bothered by an outer rival at the start, trailed in the two path, then moved up but failed to
threaten among foes late. BEDAZZLE 'EM pursued from midpack along teh inside, altered out to avoid getting shuffled leaving the three furlong pole,
launched progress in the three to four path and between horses turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer rival whlie flattening out in upper stretch
and faded between horses. SCENIC BEAUTY prompted outside of the leader, vied before disposing of that one entering the far turn, was confronted by an
outer rival turning for home, got headed in upper stretch and weakened. GUINEVERE bumped an inner rival multiple times while steadying and hard to
handle behind foes early on, raced off of the pace three wide, then in the four to five path around the far turn and failed to factor. ROYAL SUBJECT broke
slow and steadied at the start, got a bit keen behind rivals early on, lacked speed along the inside and got outrun. GRAPES FOR ELOISE showed the way
while tugging in the bit in the two path, tucked to the inside while vying with an outer rival at the five furlong pole, then faltered entering the far turn.

Footnotes
RECKER POINT took contact from an outer rival and leaned against him to maintain balance at the start, showed the way inside of a prompting rival while
remaining a path off of the inside, drew clear entering the lane, drifted out in upper stretch, straightened course and held sway from an inner pursuer through
the final furlong. SINGLE DOT YAHT tracked along the inside, pursued off of the rail around the far turn before tipping to the five path entering the lane,
gained place while shifting inside of the drifting leader at the furlong grounds, took aim but was only second best. SUN THUNDER rated at the rear two
wide, advanced between horses with a half mile remaining, then stayed on and edged show from outer rivals in the final sixteenth. ANTHEM KING snagged
the inner stall door upon leaving the gates, was slow into stride and took back from between horses shortly after the start, raced off of the pace in the four to
three path around the first turn, cut the corner entering the lane before tipping back to the three path in upper stretch, stayed on mildly to attempt a bid for
show at the sixteenth pole, but got outkicked by an inner rival. LIPS SAY BLISS stalked the top pair from the three to five path into the backstretch, ranged
up to them in the four path turning for home, but flattened out while chasing in upper stretch and yielded between horses. ELEPHANTS EAR pursued from
midpack three wide and between horses around the first turn, chased from further back along the inside around the far turn and gave way turning for home.
MIDNIGHT RAID took a graze from an inner rival soon after the start, lacked speed along the inside, then two wide around the far turn and failed to factor.
CARTUCHO made little impact four wide. UNLIMITEDPOTENTIAL prompted the leader from the four to three path, but weakened between horses entering
the lane, lugged in shortly after and was eased nearing midstretch. NATIVE SHAMAN leaned into an inner rival before being pinched back from tight
quarters between horses at the start, tugged to advance between horses before steadying entering the firs turn, pursued from midpack two wide and
between horses, but steadily faded approaching the far turn.

between horses at the furlong grounds, flopped back to his left lead while vying and drove clear in late stages. ALWAYS ANGELS pursued from midpack in
the four path, shifted to the seven path into upper stretch, rallied to bid along with inner rivals at the furlong grounds, vied but was only second best.
BACKYARD MONEY tracked in the three path, shifted out to the five path turning for home, bid along with rivals on either side at the furlong grounds, but
was outkicked by an outer pair and held show. BRU NA BOINNE was brushed by an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, pursued from the two
path around the turn, split foes in the three path to bid at the furlong grounds, but chased outer co-bidders home through the final furlong. SECRET
STATEMENT broke slowly, pursued from the three path, entered the lane in the five path before tipping wider in upper stretch, then ran on to miss fourth at

SOCIETY MAN broke a beat slow, saved ground off of the pace, progressed inside of rivals nearing the lane, smoothly tipped three wide to take aim in
upper stretch, bid at the furlong grounds and drove clear. WHO DEY stalked behind the lop pair and from the two path, split them to bid entering the
backstretch, led down the backstretch, moved to the inside approaching the far turn, but was headed by a pair of outer bidders leaving the three furlong
pole, fought on entering the lane, rebid approaching midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, kept on and narrowly saved
place. NEXT LEVEL was off half a step slow, pursued from midpack in the three path and between horses, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, ran
on willingly and missed reaching place. ROCKETEER tracked four wide, bid outside of the top pair and in the five path at the three furlong pole, gained an
advantage shortly after, led through upper stretch, but was headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and yielded between horses. WEST

Footnotes
SAHALAT stalked outside of the leader, gained an advantage in the three path turning for home and drew off under a drive. POINT CLEAR stumbled at the
start, trailed two wide, moved forward three wide entering the lane and rallied well between horses. BIG SALT LICK tracked in the three path, then ran on to
gain show late. RIVER RIDGE stalked two wide, gained place in upper stretch but tired. MAXWELL broke a step slow, raced off of the pace in the four to
five path and failed to factor. FORT SAM showed the way in the two path, got headed by the winner turning for home and weakened hanging on his left
lead. MISSION RIVER lacked speed along the inside and got outrun. LEVANTER tracked along the inside and weakened. BELLO stalked along the inside
and weakened.
