OLIVIAN stumbled at the start then quickly recovered to set the pace while saving ground and won drawing clear. DON'T TELL HYDEE prompted OLIVIAN
from along the outside, could no reach that one but finished well for second in a steady effort. RESERVOIR was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide
into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. MEAN SHARON saved ground chasing the leaders, drifted out slightly leaving the three-sixteenths pole and
lacked a rally. KERRYGOLD LADY saved ground while being allowed to settle but failed to be a serious factor. LUVAHAPPYENDING was unhurried early,
came three-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. PER RULING ECM2024-237 FROM HIWU, OLIVIAN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO
UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

MISS DYNAMIC opened a clear lead early then saved ground setting the pace and drew off to win with something left. YOU GO GIRL prompted MISS
DYNAMIC to the stretch, was unable to reach that one but continued on well for the place. SILVERY ORB was reserved off the pace while racing two-wide,
steadied nearing the quarter pole lacking room, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole to split rivals and closed strongly when clear. RUBY RAY was
prominently placed while racing four-wide and went evenly. ZIPPIN SEVENZ saved ground while being unhurried, lacked room nearing the quarter pole,
slipped through along the inside entering the stretch and finished willingly. ZAZEN saved ground while being allowed to settle, drifted out slightly nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and weakened. MISS BELLA hopped slightly at the start then was forwardly placed for a half mile while three-wide and tired.

MY SUNSHINE set the pressured pace while racing two-wide, opened a clear lead nearing the half mile pole, responded when challenged nearing the
quarter pole and prevailed un strong handling. HONKY TONK HERO saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out to be three-wide nearing the
eighth pole and closed strongly. UPPER ROOM prompted MY SUNSHINE early from along the inside, dropped back nearing the half mile pole then angled
out to be two-wide, offered a bid nearing the quarter pole but was unable to get by the winner in a game effort. HEY SEQUOIA was prominently placed while
racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. SUMMER SHANDEE was under early, rallied along the inside into the
stretch and improved his position. BABY FRANKIE was reserved off the pace while racing two-wide but lacked a rally. YOU KIDDING ME was forwardly
placed early while racing four-wide and tired.
