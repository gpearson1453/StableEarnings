EXCELLENT TIMING bumped with a rival after the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead in upper stretch,
shook clear into the final furlong and drew away under steady urging. MARKET ALERT bumped with a rival after the start then dropped back, was ridden
along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch, drifted out inside the furlong marker then was straightened by the rider and
finished with late energy well out in the track to just get the place. POPPY'S PRIDE was ridden along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive, chased into the final furlong and just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. DANGEROUS RIDE was hustled
from the gate then chased the pace on the outside, went five wide on the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and just missed the trifecta. EMERALD
FOREST lacked early speed, went two then three wide on the turn, gained into upper stretch but flattened out and lacked the needed response. FUNNY
JOKE went to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage near the three-sixteenths pole,
dropped back into the final furlong and tired. NOLO CONTESTO was ridden along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and failed to rally.
SAGAMORE MISCHIEF was urged along on the inside, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond.

through the turn and upped the pressure through the bend taking over command at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear
under a drive kept to task. GRAND OPENING got bumped at the start by THAT'S MONEY, who broke in a step, chased along the inside and then just off
the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. ELYSIAN MEADOWS three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, offered up a bid and continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and kept on to
secure the show honors. THAT'S MONEY broke in a step at the start and bumped GRAND OPENING, established the front and showed the way lightly
coaxed on the pace, came under pressure from DOC SULLIVAN five furlongs from home and clung to command until displaced at the three-eighths, took
the inside route into upper stretch now behind that rival and tired. MISCHIEF JOKE coaxed from the start, raced three then two wide in pursuit coming under

Footnotes
SPEIGHTFUL LILY broke out and bumped with a foe, quickly sped clear then showed the way, cruised around the turn in the two then three path,
responded well when asked five wide into upper stretch then came under a right-handed crop, remained on her inside lead into the final furlong, swapped to
the proper lead after getting one pop of a left-handed crop approaching the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best while placed under a hand-ride to the
finish. MEL'S BABY SISTER was hustled from the gate, moved out while urged along off the pace, chased three then four wide on the turn, was driven six
wide into upper stretch and earned the place while no match for the winner. MYSARIA was urged along on the outside, dropped back leaving the
backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, remained on her inside lead in the stretch and tired while just able to get the show.
MOMMASGOTTAGUN was bumped at the start and off a step slow, raced on the outside under urging, went four then five wide on the turn, shifted six wide
at the quarter-pole then dropped in and failed to rally. THIRTEEN RED FLAGS was hustled from the gate then settled on the inside, dropped back late on
the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
AZ U CHASE ME two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near
the eighth pole, drew clear under a drive to prevail. BIG EGO vied early between foes from the two path through the first turn before settling three to four
paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of KID KREESA who held sole command inside six furlongs to run, advanced three wide into the
turn and took over the front with seven-sixteenths remaining, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under
threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole, proved no match for the top one late while running on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. WO
HOP chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
and kept on to procure the show honors. DUNEDIN CAUSEWAY chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five to
six wide into upper stretch offering up a bid, then improved position to the finish kept to task. KID KREESA vied along the inside of a pair of rivals through
the first turn before taking sole command just inside six furlongs to go, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home and
had BIG EGO advance outside and yielded the front at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung just off the inside into upper
stretch and weakened. FOUR EYES got bumped after the start by AWESOME FORCE, then got steadied along the rail seven and a half furlongs out,
chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and tired. UNAUDITED coaxed from the gate, vied three wide
outside a pair through the first turn before chasing five then four wide, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and
tired. AWESOME FORCE got coaxed from the start and came outwards bumping FOUR EYES, chased along the inside through the turn and then four to
five wide down the backstretch, tucked briefly two to three wide at the half mile pole before heading four wide through the far turn, went five wide for home
and tired. CHARMING JIM broke a half a beat slow and lost his lane to BIG EGO, chased four wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, continued four
wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MAMA'S MIDDIE chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six to seven wide
into upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
DRAKE'S PASSAGE went to the front, raced inside on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, inched away in the two path on the far turn,
responded well when asked near the quarter-pole and drew off under a strong hand-ride. DONEGAL SURGES stalked the pace on the outside in the three
path, was asked on the far turn, chased the winner into upper stretch and proved no match while well clear for the place. WHITTINGTON PARK traveled
three wide around the opening bend, settled off the pace, was roused late on the backstretch, moved from three to five wide on the turn, angled out near the
furlong marker and got up for the show. DR ARDITO raced in the two path on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along with five furlongs to run,
moved from three to five wide on the far turn and came up empty. SHERIFF BIANCO stumbled badly at the start and nearly unseated the rider, had the rider
recover from having both legs over the left side of his mount, remarkably regained balance in the saddle while out of his right iron, reached down to adjust
the iron near the mile-marker, regained footing shortly thereafter, saved ground while settling off the pace, was put to urging near the half-mile pole, raced
inside on the far turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole and had nothing left. UNION FLEET dropped from the two path to the rail early on the
first turn, settled at the rear, saved ground under urging on the far turn and failed to respond.

RAININGATTHEBEACH coaxed from the gate, raced two to three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and slipped away in
concert with that rival from the rest of the field through the latter portion of the turn, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and
collared the front outside the eighth pole, drew clear under a drive to prevail. TOUR JETE chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one, kept on to duel with SENDERA and was along to secure the place
honors. SENDERA hustled from the start, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top one and fought head to head with the aforementioned foe to the finish but was bested for the place honors while safe for the show. THE
SPLENDID ONE hustled from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside and then just off the inside coming under pressure from
RAININGATTHEBEACH through the turn, got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths and widened away from the rest of the field as a pair, continued just
off the inside for home, dug in under threat and relented just outside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. LUCKY AND GORGEOUS just off
the inside through the first turn, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the far turn under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, went four wide for home and weakened. STARTS NOW chased along the inside throughout under coaxing from three furlongs out and
tired in the stretch. TONE OF SILENCE showed brief speed four then three wide, came under coaxing in retreat at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide
into upper stretch and faltered. HOLDER CLOSE chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued two to three wide for home and
folded. ROZAY SUMMER chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cornered two to three wide into

Footnotes
VENTI VALENTINE was restless in the gate but broke very fast, saved ground on the first turn, settled comfortably off the pace, was roused while moving
from the two path to the four path early on the far turn, rallied outside to get the lead in upper stretch, drifted in and out from the crop while moving clear in
the drive and drew away while much the best. BUSTIN BAY was coaxed from the gate, went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside,
chased three wide on the far turn, moved out behind the winner in upper stretch and proved no match while able to get the place. BON ADIEU bumped with
a foe at the start, went around most of the first turn in the two path then dropped to the rail while moving clear, showed the way down the backstretch, was
asked while inside to the two path on the far turn, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and tired while able to get the show. SUNSET LOUISE
bumped with a rival at the start and was last away, angled in at the rear, settled while saving ground, was urged on the far turn and lacked the needed
response. MIDTOWN LIGHTS bumped with an opponent at the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, was urged two then three
wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. FINGAL'S CAVE went three wide on the first turn, was urged along while outside
on the backstretch, came up empty in the three to four path on the far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
UNION TRAIL forwardly placed three wide through the first turn, settled just off the inside between foes into the backstretch latched on the leader to the
outside, steadily increased the pressure on the front from the nine-sixteenths and took over command with seven-sixteenths remaining, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole, then finished geared down at the end clear
to the wire. WHISTLER'S HONOR bobbled at the break, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, bumped the hind end of
MIRACLE MIKE at the quarter pole spinning that rival inwards a bit and went four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on
to the finish well clear of the rest and second best. BAD LARRY coaxed from the gate, went four then three wide through the first turn then raced three wide
in aim of the leader latched on the top pair to the outside down the backstretch, got shaken off a bit into the far turn and came under coaxing at the
three-eighths to join that top pair once more, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong while along for the show honors. MIRACLE
MIKE bobbled at the break and then got forced to steady when STARQUIST came outwards directly in front, chased three then four wide coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, was four to five wide at the quarter pole when bumped in the hind end and turned inwards by WHISTLER'S HONOR and
went five to six wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. STARQUIST came outwards under coaxing from the gate and forced MIRACLE MIKE to
steady off his heels when taking over his lane, showed the way in hand along the inside accompanied by a pair of rivals early on until UNION TRAIL upped
the ante applying true pressure with nine-sixteenths to go, got headed at the seven-sixteenths and came under coaxing at the three-eighths in response,
faded and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then folded in the stretch and was eased home through the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
SPIRIT OF ST LOUIS moved out on the first turn then reached the four path, stalked the pace on the outside, engaged the leaders in the four then five path
on the final turn, took over when asked into upper stretch then kicked clear under a strong hand-ride, was given one light tap with a right-handed crop near
the furlong marker, drew away while kept to the task until near the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. DISARMED dropped from the two
path to the rail while going to the front on the first turn, showed the way on the inside of a rival, was asked while inside on the far turn, lost the advantage
into upper stretch and proved no match for the winner while just able to save the place. MAKER'S CANDY bobbled slightly at the start, went four wide on
the first turn, settled off the pace, was ridden along with five furlongs to run then dropped back, moved from four to six wide on the turn, kept on in the
stretch and just missed the place while narrowly up for the show. JERRY THE NIPPER was hustled from the gate, prompted the pace on the outside in the
three path, was asked on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired then lost trifecta position. JACKSON HEIGHTS angled from the five path to
the two path on the first turn, lagged at the rear, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, saved ground on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch
and was no factor.
