Footnotes
HALE'S LUCKY LADY away in good order, with the pace out of the chute, vied between rivals into the turn, began to edge away with a furlong. SISSUE with
the pace while racing three side, could not match the winner through the lane, clearly second best. SALT CREEK CAT forced the pace along the inside,
gradually weakened, finished up best of the rest. GERTIE broke back, lacked speed, improved position without posing a serious threat. LITTLE MO
BROWN broke back and failed to menace while racing just off the inside. GOSPEL EXTRA in the second flight, carried very wide into the stretch to lose all
chance. LIL TIZZY also behind the lead pack early, bore out badly exiting the turn. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND
WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

Footnotes
TWO WORLDS dueled up front in the two path from the start, continued to alternate up front off the inside, headed late, regained the advantage late then
had enough left to withstand the runner up. JACKS SPRING BREAK never far back, fell back off the dueling leaders a bit in the third turn while off the
inside, rebid late to be getting to the winner late. FLASHY BOY GOES set or forced the pace throughout along the inside, narrowly showed the way into the
stretch, faltered late. NOMOREMRNICEGUY within striking distance, into the second turn while between horses, began to weaken into the third bend.
WAVERUNNER in the second flight early, moved closer to press while five wide through the second bend, also faltered when the real running began with
less than a quarter remaining. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO
ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

AMBER'S DIAMOND asked to clear early along the inside, showed the way out of the chute, increased that advantage through the turn, remained
comfortably clear through the lane under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. COIN PURSE chased the winner in vain while off the inside, proved no match
for that one, clearly second best. GOLDIE'S LEGACY one paced inside, saved the show late. SUGAR COATED also turned in an even effort, gaining for the
show late while not a threat to the top pair. IRISH WRIT fell back after the start, continued to lack speed in the three path, lacked a rally. MS. BUZZINGA

SARA'S SAPPHIRE narrowly showed way out of the chute, continued to vie into and through the first turn, shook clear late backstretch, not threatened in
the run to the wire while being kept to task. COZZOLANI vied up front outside the favorite, continued on equal terms onto the backstretch, could not keep up
into the far turn, comfortably finished best of the rest. RIVER LIBERTY last leaving, raced back, staged a mild rally for the show off the inside while not a
threat to the top two. FACESTER got out a bit into the first turn, continued back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. EURODOINDONUTS
rank early along the inside, moved out and advanced to press the issue first turn, gave way despite urging late on the backstretch. SCARLET POSITION
contested the issue past the wire the first time three wide, began a steady retreat before a half. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR

Footnotes
MISTER WAYSIDE showed the way out of the chute in the two path by a narrow margin, extended that advantage through the turn while continuing to race
off the inside, drew off steadily through the lane while drifting out a bit. KICK IT AGAIN BOB within striking distance up the inside, bit rank, then steadied
between horses into the turn, fell back, came again for the place gamely between horses. MYSTERIOUS TALE slight bobble break, pressed the winner from
the outside up the backstretch, chased that one into the stretch, proved no match for that one in the run to the wire, outkicked for the second spot while
widest of the second flight at the wire. SILVER PONZI behind the pace inside, roused for the drive, late bid for the runner up position, not enough at the
wire. EURO TRACKING behind the pace while off the inside, steadied slightly as the runner up was also doing so entering the turn, fell back and came up
empty for the drive. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE
AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

SODDY DAISY stalked early, asked for run to engage the leader late on the backstretch, dueled second turn, roused into the lane, edged clear under
continued steady handling. MS. HILLARY settled behind the pace, three to four wide through the second turn when creeping closer, finished with good
determination to narrowly garner the place while unable to get to the winner late. JUST ROSIE ran to be off slowly, raced back, asked along into the lane,
bid for the place inside the runner up, missed. BROOKE'S ALL IN took over to show the way past the wire the first time, continued to show the way through
the first turn and up the backstretch, offered brief resistance to the winner inside that one when challenged final turn, weakened when headed. VA VOOM
raced behind the leaders early, remained with striking distance into the far turn, had nothing for the drive. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR
MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

DETERMINED LOVER moved up to duel after the start, continued to alternate the middle quarter mile, showed the way into the lane and kicked clear.
SUPERHERO away alertly from between horses, alternated up front while closest to the inside, asked along far turn but could not match the winner through
the stretch while shifting out when straightened for home. DIAMONDS R LUCKY settled off the pace, angled in a bit to cut the corner into the stretch, not
enough for the place while gaining the show. ALWAYS A KING forwardly placed, three wide into the stretch, had little left for the stretch run. GOSPEL
FOREST fell back after a quarter, continued to fade and finished well back. EMPYREAL SHADOW raced wide into the first turn, continued sluggish up the
backstretch, finished far back, jogged in. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO

Footnotes
OOEY GOOEY CHEWY stalked the dueling leaders for a half, advanced and challenged three wide turning for home,long drive in dueling with the runner
up, narrowly gained at the wire. WAR HAWK stumbled at the start, quickly recovered to duel off the inside, continued to battle into and through the second
turn, between foes into the stretch, second duel inside the winner to the wire, narrowly missed in a game effort. LUCKY MCCOY broke well, settled behind
the early pace toward the inside, came on the outside for the drive, finished up willingly to be closing the gap on the top two late. MAJOR PAYNE away in
good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, first to blink late in the final bend. WRISTBAND shuffled back a bit at the start, void of speed for a half,
showed some belated interest along the inside. DEROY raced in mid pack, continued one paced while racing outside through the lane in lacking a closing
response. KYEMBEA four wide in the first turn when forwardly placed, gradually faded. TUFF MANDATE last away, trailed throughout in showing little. THIS
RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST

Footnotes
DEL MOON with the pace from the start, carried out a bit first turn, continued to alternated up front off the inside, extended drive, proved best late under
steady handling. LIARS CLUB dueled up front past the wire the first time, got out slightly first turn, continued to contest the issue into and through the final
turn, long drive, outfinished in the late going, clearly second best. LIMBO'S PROMISE back off the pace, staged a mild rally while not a threat to the top pair.
HOODOO BROWN settled off the pace, even effort, lacked a serious closing kick. RONALD DALE prompted the dueling leaders while three wide, had little
left for the stretch run. CHARING CROSS remained back throughout in lacking a closing response. ELECTORAL in mid pack early, steadily faded. FATHER
PATRICK last away, trailed throughout to be always outrun. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED
USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

Footnotes
STORMS LAST broke on top, pressed the issue early between horses, fell back the middle quarter mile, ranged up to challenge four wide in the second
turn, kicked clear through the stretch under steady handling. PONZA set or forced the pace off the inside, between horses through the second turn, could
not match the winner late while holding sway for the place. FORTY STRANGERS in mid pack early along the inside, continued to save ground up the
backstretch and into the far turn, finished up willingly to be getting the runner up late. SWORD OF GOLD void of early foot, three wide second turn, between
rivals through the lane, managed a mild rally. CATALE HURRYCANE vied up front four wide through the first turn, continued to race on the pace up the
backstretch, weakened from between horses and inside the winner turning for home. HE BLUE BAYOU with the early pace inside, weakened after a half.
SEARCHIN SAFARI remained back in failing to menace. HE'S A ROCK six wide into the first turn, raced forwardly and outside up the backstretch, gave way
in the final turn. I'M ALIVE was finished early. PRINCE CAROLINA J last away, continued to race sluggishly, finished far back and jogged in. THIS RACE
HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE
TIME.
