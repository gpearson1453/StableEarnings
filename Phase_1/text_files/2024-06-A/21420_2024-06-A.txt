Footnotes
RAINY SKIES , three wide outside a rival stalking the pace, took closer order mid turn, responded when asked four wide into the lane, engaged the leader
soon after, wrested command under left handed asks in mid stretch, kicked clear then held firm while kept to task. KING'S RIVER rated in range while about
four wide, circled four wide under coaxing into the stretch, kept grinding through the final furlong and gained the place. MASAKADO cleared leaving the
chute, set the pace towards the inside, was engaged by the winner soon into the lane, battled on to about the sixteenth marker then faded.
SILVERBULLETTWENTY broke a bit slow, settled off the pace while saving some ground, angled out around the turn, progressed four wide between
runners near mid stretch then flattened out late. PACO THE TACO MAN dropped back off the early pace while off the inside, came under a ride around the
turn, entered the stretch four to five wide and slowly gained. MAD BANKER saved ground stalking the pace, failed to keep pace into the stretch and
weakened. RESTLESS prompted the pace two wide, lacked a punch leaving the three eighths then faded between foes.

the stretch, challenged for the lead approaching the sixteenth pole and narrowly prevailed. GLAMOROUS , reluctant to load into the starting gate, stalked
the pace well off the inner rail around the turn, eased out to the five path in upper stretch, drew on even terms with the winner inside the sixteenth pole and
just missed. INTEL AGENT lacked speed, raced inside horses in the stretch, was brushed by LADY LEMONCELLO approaching the sixteenth pole and
finished gamely. LADY LEMONCELLO , caught behind horses in upper stretch, worked between rivals, brushed INTEL AGENT when bearing in
approaching the sixteenth pole and finished gamely. HARMONIZING set a pressured pace along the inner rail around the turn, drifted out entering the

pace and faltered. LEGEND OF LIGHT prompted the pace outside HARMONIZING and faltered.

WHATAHARDMANFIDEAD settled off of a contested pace while in the clear and removed from the rail, picked up the pace when angled out and asked
leaving the three eighths, advanced four wide to take aim soon into the stretch, bid to engage HURRYING HOME from the outside in mid stretch, dueled,
wrested the advantage with about a sixteenth to go then held firm while kept alert. HURRYING HOME , three deep prompting the pace, took a short lead
between runners leaving the three eighths, was nudged along while hounded from his outside nearing the lane, briefly cleared in upper stretch, dug in when
confronted by the winner soon after then battled gamely to the inside of that one to the wire. LAST SECOND LOUIE came in at the break and bumped with
THRUSTER, corrected and edged up while four deep around the first turn, continued four wide outside rivals through the backstretch run, dropped in a path
when bidding outside foes around the final turn, forced the issue into the lane, could not quite go on with the leaders when switching over to his correct lead
in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. MIKE THE BOMB lost ground five wide around the first turn, dropped in nearing the five eighths and tracked the
quartet of leaders took closer order into the far turn, eased back out leaving the three eighths, chased between runners approaching the stretch, shifted in
and faded. HOMECOMING KING lagged back, raced four to five wide in upper stretch and failed to menace. MOON SIGN set a pressured pace inside,
dueled past the five eighths, stayed on till about the three eighths then gave way. KICK STARTNESS vied two wide and between foes, gained a slim lead
around the far turn, ceded the lead soon after, chased past the five sixteenths then faltered. THRUSTER , bumped and in tight at the break, saved ground
off the pace and lacked a rally.

JUMPINGJAGGERFLASH saved ground on the turn setting the pace, floated out a bit in upper stretch, drifted out near the eighth pole and prevailed under
urging. DUCKPINS saved ground around the turn in a forward position, remained along the rail through the stretch and rallied. WIN NO JOKE circled the
turn three wide, floated out some in upper stretch, had aim on the lead in mid stretch and flattened out. C C GOLDRUSH raced in the two path on the turn,
moved out some in upper stretch and rallied between rivals. SUMMERSTATEOFMIND prompted the pace outside the winner around the turn and
weakened in the drive. EVENLY DIVIDED , four wide on the turn, lacked a rally. SINCERITO , steadied leaving the starting gate, raced wide turning for
home and failed to be a factor. YAQUI VALLEY , outrun, was very wide turning for home. CELTIC SEA stayed along the inner rail on the turn and gave way.

the five sixteenths, circled four wide into the lane, closed in under pressure and took over outside rivals in mid stretch, kicked away and was confidently
handled through the final sixteenth. MORNING THOUGHTS broke sharply, cleared then angled in to set the pace, took pressure through the backstretch
run, dueled to the inside of WORKIN ON A DREAM from the quarter pole to mid stretch then stayed on gamely to earn the place. WORKIN ON A DREAM
broke a step slow, regrouped and pulled his way forward, was snugly in hand tracking a contested pace heading to the half, bid three deep leaving the far
turn, dueled on a slim lead into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. SHIVAREE , caught four wide around the first turn, dropped off the pace
through the backstretch, raced removed from the rail in upper stretch, angled out near mid stretch then lacked a solid finish. CAPTAIN CARDO , three wide
between rivals around the first turn, forced the pace outside MORNING THOUGHTS through the backstretch and into the far turn, was under pressure
between runners past the three eighths, failed to go on in upper stretch and weakened. TRANSFER THE FUNDS broke a step slow and was outrun.

Footnotes
CAROLINE KRYSTYNA had speed to lead early then rated kindly back off an eager inner rival into the turn, tracked in the two path mid turn, eased out and
moved up in upper stretch, forged clear near mid stretch, was engaged from her outside near the sixteenth pole, kept on tenaciously under a drive and
prevailed. PROVE MY LOVE stalked three wide, was under some coaxing to stay in range mid turn, shifted out five wide in upper stretch, rolled up to
engage the winner leaving the sixteenth marker, had her rider stand up for a few strides soon after, kept on gamely but was denied through the final yards.
AFANDI saved ground mid turn, edged up leaving the three sixteenths, swung out and closed steadily. CAVALIER CUPID rated inside, took closer order
into the lane, eased out, gained some between rivals near mid stretch then flattened out very late. WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER , brushed and in a bit close at
the break, settled off the pace and outside a rival, angled out for the drive and churned on through the final sixteenth. ABOVE THE LIMIT broke outward and
was away a beat slow, corrected and accelerated to the inside of the winner to take control and clear, set the pace towards the inside, ceded past the three
sixteenths and weakened. DOUBLE FIREBALL brushed with an outer rival and was in a bit tight soon after, dropped off the pace while saving ground then
failed to generate a serious run. ROYAL WHISPER , reluctant to load, dropped off the pace and failed to menace. OUR LIBERTY BELLE was outrun.
