ASSERTIVE ATTITUDE a bit reluctant loading, raced five wide, then four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, bid on the far turn, quickly took over,
drew clear, then was all out late to hold on. CROWN THAT SAINT raced off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch run,
challenged the winner in deep stretch and dug in gamely to the end. LONELY RIDE raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn, came three wide
into the lane, angled out and rallied mildly outside for third. THE HEIGHTS raced off the pace with a ground saving trip, moved up on the far turn, then
lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. LAKE CHAPALA lunged at the break, raced off the pace, moved up on the far turn, went four wide past the quarter
pole, made a bid and flattened out. IMAGINIZED was a bit reluctant to load, raced four wide early, then stalked inside, chased between rivals on the far turn
and tired. TIZ MARKS SPIRIT raced off the pace inside and had no rally. SMOOTH PLAYER trailed the field on the inside, came wide into the stretch and
failed to threaten. EL TEKILERO showed good early speed, opened up to set the pace and gave way on the far turn. DON VINO VICI raced three wide off
the pace and did not factor.
