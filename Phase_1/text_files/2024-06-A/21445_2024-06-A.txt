Footnotes
SKY'S NO LIMIT saved ground throughout, bid to the front late and held off late challenge driving. NEW SPELL settled far back inside, swung wide into the
stretch and rallied well. ZIHUATANEJO set the pace inside, remained ahead to the eighth pole and weakened. IMPAZIBLE PRINCE prompted the pace
outside, bid on the final turn then weakened. TIME TESTED raced rank when pulling hard early, chased inside and faded. DIRTY HARRY moved closer
outside after half a mile and faltered. EVASIVE MOVES trailed for three quarters and passed fading rivals. UNAFFECTED dropped far back and was always
outrun. UNCLE CHROME broke alertly then stopped abruptly after half a mile.

ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM moved close up between rivals into the far turn then gave way. GAVICHI prompted pace four wide down the backstretch then
retreated. GIA'S FUEGO pressed the leader three wide between rivals then stopped.

Footnotes
MISS PRETENDER settled close up inside, angled out rallying into the stretch, bid clear and lasted. QUEEN ROCKET dropped far behind, advanced
extremely wide with a late rush. KEEP IT SWEET trailed opening half mile, moved very wide and closed well too late. BOSSY KATE settled off the leaders
outside, split foes in midstretch and finished willingly. ECLAIR BLANC rated early inside, swung wide advancing into the stretch then flattened out.
DETERMINED JUSTINE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter to the stretch and weakened. SLIVER OF SUNSHINE dropped well behind in two path
then never a factor. PEACH TEA came out into the first turn, saved ground and proved empty in the lane. MY HUNNY BUNNY set a clear pace to the final
turn and faltered. LOST IN THOUGHT dropped back early and was always outrun.

CONCHO pressed the winner outside to the stretch and faltered. VILLANITO rushed up wide down the backstretch then gave way. HOT LOVE lacked
speed saving ground and weakened steadily. T'WAS THE NIGHT dropped back at the break and trailed throughout.
