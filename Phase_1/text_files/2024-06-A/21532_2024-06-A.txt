HIP TO YOUR TRICKS was nestled on the rail in mid-pack along the backside, waited on the fence behind the frontrunner throughout the turn, shifted
outside to the two path for the drive and wore down the leader in the shadow of the wire for the win. SOUPER COP travelled in midfield outside runners in
the early stages, was roused four wide to go with others making a move at the quarter pole, loomed a presence between runners in the four path turning for
home, was gaining on the front two at the furlong pole and captured the place share but didn't have enough late to threaten for the win at the finish line.
CADFAEL broke outwards on the start, pulled the rider to the lead five eighths from the finish, comfortably set the pace with little pressure from foes around
the bend, was set down clinging up top at the furlong pole and fought on stubbornly, but weakened very late losing a couple of placings at the finish line.
SPANISH SERENADE stalked near the back in the beginning, began to inch closer five wide maintaining position at the quarter pole, was brushed briefly
with horses on both sides straightening out for home and finished up willingly for a minor role in the end. AMAZING SUCCESS was away slowly spotting the
field down the backside, caught up to runners by the five sixteenth pole, circled rivals six wide at the quarter pole, could not sustain the run by the furlong
marker and faded in deep stretch. DANCIN' DEPUTY was brushed inside on the break, had the lead in the early going, was relegated to track outside down
the backstretch at the five eighths marker, chased the frontrunner outside through the turn, was in range in the three path turning for home. lacked a rally
down the stretch and could no factor at the wire.

Footnotes
SHAMELESS AFFAIR stalked inside in the third flight at the half, rallied smartly in the two path straightening out for the drive, drifted out, bumping the
outside rival in the stretch with three sixteenths to go and was kept to the task to comfortably prevail at the finish line. RED MOOD tracked outside in the
second flight going around the oval, took closer order to threaten in the three path at the quarter pole, drifted in, exchanging bumps with the eventual winner
inside the three sixteenths marker and determinedly fought on to the finish, capturing the place share in the end. CHIPOTLE PEPPER cleared to the rail by
the half, dictated the pace through the turn, was headed outside at the furlong marker by the winner, could not offer a response and faded late but did hold
onto the show prize at the wire. HASLEMERE was squeezed at the start, travelled outside near the back of the pack in the beginning, began to pick up
runners outside at the three eighths pole, shifted out widest in the six path for the drive and ran on determinedly to just miss closing in to capture third
money in the end. LIAM'S AWESOME settled near the rear inside down the backstretch, made little progression saving ground throughout the turn and
showed good late energy, bursting between runners in the final seventy yards. FEATHERWEIGHT pressed the issue on the inside in the early stages,
tracked behind the frontrunner on the fence around the turn, tried to find a clear path to run through in upper stretch, found a lane late but lacked a finish in
deep stretch. AFRICAN SAFARI hopped slightly on the start, was nudged for better inside position down the back straight, lost some action jumping a
shadow nearing the half mile marker to be shuffled back around the turn, angled outside in the five path for the stretch run but had little finish to offer.
POWAQA was bumped inside at the break, trailed down the backside, could not get involved travelling around the oval and passed a tired runner down the
lane. PEACE IN PARADISE broke outwards on the start, settled in mid-pack four deep along the backstretch, stalked in the third flight on the outside
through the turn, closed in the four path at the quarter pole but had little left and faltered in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
HOT CARGO pressed the issue inside at the start, was then smartly reined back to re-engage on the outside by the half, hounded the frontrunner outside
through the turn, began to pull away from the early speed rival by the eighth pole and cruised home for the tally. CLASSY IMAGE tracked the front pair
sitting on the rail in the early stages, continued on the fence watching the front two go at it around the oval, shifted just outside in the two path turning for
home and closed in smartly to just get up for second money at the finish line. SILVER BULLET LADY cleared from the outside post to get the lead down the
backstretch, battled on the rail while pressured outside around the turn, could not match strides with winner by mid-stretch and faded late to be nabbed at
the wire for the runner up finish. KNOW HOW (GB) was situated in the two path with runners on both side down the backside, lost positioning to trail by the
three furlong marker, stayed inside saving ground through the turn, shifted outside, three wide at the top of the lane and showed some late interest to get up
for a minor role in the end. REMEMBERING RHODA settled in the three path between runners down the backside tracking the top two, took closer order
outside in the second flight around the bend, fought for the show award at the top of the stretch, had little left to give at the furlong pole and wilted in deep
stretch. ASHBURY tracked the contesting pair running four deep outside rivals down the back straight, made little headway travelling three wide on the turn,
shifted out to be four wide for the drive and never factored down the lane.

GREAT FACES tossed the head just slightly at the start, settled in behind tracking inside and saving ground, moved out passing the three-eighths, made a
swift move four then five wide on the far turn, took over the lead in upper stretch, drifted in and out a bit, held sway under steady handling. H C HOLIDAY
settled mid-pack tucking in on the first turn after being caught four to five deep entering that bend, began to advance late on the far turn having shifted out
four deep, couldn't reach the winner but was clearly second best. INFAMOUS COVERT settled outside at the back, began to pick it up four to five wide on
the far turn, gaind show honors. HELL BENT exchanged a minor brush at the start, stalked two to three wide in the early going, moved to the lead at the
four- and one-half to force the issue, led into upper stretch, was overtaken and lacked the needed late kick, lost show late. THREE SONNY SIDEUP was
coaxed forward from the break then settled on the front-end dictating terms inside on or just off the rail, was overtaken after a half and scrubbed along to
keep pace chasing inside, weakened through the far turn and in the stretch. ARGENTIUM settled inside at the rear after exchanging a light brush at the
start, saved ground early, swung six wide for the drive and passed a tired rival. MAKE NO MISTAKE was well-placed stalking from outside three to four
wide, came up empty.

JUST FOLLOW ME was brushed inside on the break, stalked outside near the rear of this compact field along the backstretch, began to extend her stride,
moving in comfortably three wide at the quarter pole, was full of run in the four path to take the lead at the sixteenth pole, switched leads late and drew off
connivingly in the end. MAXIMUM FIFTY took control from the onset, set a rapid pace loose on the lead going around the turn, did not switch leads down
the lane, began to shorten stride at the furlong marker and held on to best the rest at the wire. WILDFIRE settled in mid-division, all alone down the
backstretch, came under a ride keeping pace on the fence throughout the turn, continued to pursue down the stretch and stayed on to be a clear third at the
finish line. NOT A LOST CAUSE trailed the field inside by the half, could not get involved seeing the field around the turn, passed a weary one in deep
stretch but was never in contention throughout the race. JOYA DE ORO broke outwards on the start, tracked the lone speed outside down the backstraight,
chased the leader around the bend, was asked for more by the quarter pole, offered no response, gave way down the stretch and was not persevered with
late.

BOUND TO BE TRUE broke outwardly, settled into stride stalking the leaders, moved four to five wide late on the turn, took the lead at the three-sixteenths,
was put to urging and responded by drawing away late despite drifting a bit in the stretch. SOUPER SUPREME was close early pressing from outside,
raced three to four wide, put a short head in front near the quarter pole, was overtaken at the top of the stretch and proved no match for the winner but
preserved the place. AMBITIOUS LASS brushed the gate lightly at the start, pressed from between runners early, dropped back behind foes into the turn,
angled out at the top of the stretch, lost the crop near the furlong grounds while widest five deep, ran on to be best of the rest. MOBULA set a pressured
pace inside just off the rail, weakened in the stretch. CAN'T BUY CLASS was outpaced early racing outside a foe at the back through the turn and was
never a threat. RAGS TO DIAMONDS broke a step slowly, was outsprinted early, saved ground on the turn, was never near enough to trheaten.

Footnotes
AMERICAN STARLET broke out on the start, went to the lead between runners after the break, maintained a slim advantage setting a brisk pace on the
turn, put away the early challenger in upper stretch and by a diminishing margin just held on for the win. LANTANA LADY was unhurried to see the field
along the backside, continued to be at the rear through the turn, waiting patiently to uncork her run, shifted out in the five path having her sights set on the
leaders turning for home and was closing in quickly outside of rivals to the wire but just ran out of room at the finish. SACRED DANCER was under a snug
hold sitting back off the engaged pair down the backside, continued to measure the leaders through the turn, moved in to loom boldly three wide at the top
of the lane and was gaining steadily while drifting out coming to the finish line. VERDEJO stalked three deep outside horses in the early going, began to
narrow the gap three wide by the quarter pole, was closing in strongly between foes in the stretch and was in very tight quarters at the finish to share for the
show award. I'M INTO MISCHIEF was bumped inside on the break, prompted the pace outside down the back straight, continued to hound the frontrunner
outside on the turn, chased the winner in upper stretch and yielded late, losing positions in the final seventy yards. LUZ DE LA LUNA was nestled on the
fence, watching the contesting duo on the backside, continued to sit behind the front two doing battle on the turn, was urged to go after the leaders by the
quarter pole, offered little run and was one paced in the stretch. CANADIANSWEETHEART stalked on the fence in the backstretch, made little impression
inside around the turn, shifted three wide at the top of the stretch but could not get involved driving to the wire.

Footnotes
OLIVIA ROSE set the pace from outside a rival, moved clear and shifted in after the opening quarter, was steadily urged through the stretch and held sway
while drifting out off the rail a bit. RED SAMURAI advanced three wide on the turn outside runners, was no match for the winner but second best. LUNCH
WITH BERNIE shifted in, saved ground on the turn, advanced inside rivals in upper stretch, ran on evenly and held show honors. BRAVO KATE bobbled
outwardly at the start, raced between foes three wide into the turn moving out four wide by the quarter pole and wider still for the drive, was gaining well in
the closing stages but far too late and just missed third. SHAMANS GIRL broke inwardly and a step slowly, brought up the rear from inside heading into the
turn, shifted out nearing the quarter pole, came out five wide for the drive, ran on with mild late interest. MORE MONEY HUNNY raced outside foes four to
five wide through the turn and failed to rally. SOUNDS PRACTICAL pressed from inside through the opening quarter, switched out and pursued the eventual
winner from outside on the turn, was put to urging at the quarter pole racing two to three deep and in striking distance, faltered and faded. NOVEL broke a
step slowly, saved ground on the turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
CARA CARA bobbled soon after the break, recovered quickly to track the leader inside in the beginning, shifted outside going into the turn, began to reel in
the leader by the quarter pole, switched leads with a furlong to go, found another gear and drew off in deep stretch. BOTTA SWING was situated near the
back of the pack in the early stages, started to pick up runners three wide at the quarter pole, angled out gathering speed in the five path outside rivals
straightening out for the drive and was flying late to capture second money in a photo. CHROMEPLATED HEART assumed command from the start,
opened up to be loose up top with seven sixteenths remaining, continued to dictate terms throughout the turn, was clinging onto the lead with an eighth to
go, could not hold off the winner and faded late even losing the place share at the wire. INDIAN MUSIC watched the engaged duo down the backstretch,
edged closer on the fence through the turn, was in the hunt on the rail in upper stretch and finished up willingly for a minor share. SOUPER FLASHY
travelled three deep in midfield along the back straight, crept closer to the leaders three wide around horse at the quarter pole and finished up with intent
battling on the fringes in the end. GREAVETTE travelled inside foes down the backstraight in mid-pack, waited behind a wall of horses going through the
turn, had a clear path on the rail at the furlong marker but could only finish up evenly to the finish. SOUPER SUNDAY tracked four deep outside foes along
the backside, put in a rally advancing midway on the turn until the eighth pole in the four path, could finished up and wilted in the final seventy yards.
SHOWGIRL LYNNE B broke outwards to begin, stalked near the rear on the rail, made little progress going around the oval and had nothing to give running
to the wire. HELLO FRIENDS was off a bit slow, breaking inwards on the start, co-trailed on the outside down the backstretch, was checked mildly entering
the turn, swung out widest in the seven path turning for home and had little to offer in the stretch drive. JUST ON TIME had a good position watching the
front two along the backstretch, kept pace with the leaders running between horses around turn, was in range in the three path at the top of the lane, could
not offer a finish and folded with a sixteenth to run. FAITHFUL CREEK was void of early speed to co-trail on the inside, hugged the fence through the turn
but could not be a presence inside down the stretch.
