Footnotes
AFRAIDOFTHEBUNNY tracked the leaders into the far turn, rallied five wide under a steady advance to engage the leader in mid-stretch and pull clear
inside the sixteenth pole. COURT CONTENDER reserved off the pace in the early going, rallied up the fence down the backside to striking distance, tipped
out to take command nearing the quarter pole, opened a clear lead in upper stretch, failed to change leads in the lane and weakened late. BRIGHT
FORECAST stalked the pace from two wide for a half mile, lost position on the turn and kept-on through the lane lacking a closing kick. MY HANDSOME
MAN went evenly passing tiring rivals in the stretch. ESTILO MAGICO set the pace on a clear lead for five-eighths and tired coming home. MASTER OF
NONE broke awkwardly, bobbled while off balance, trailed the field, chased down the backside, and came up empty having lost all interest at the start.

DISCO BALL moved up the fence a few strides from the gate to take command, set a well measured pace, responded when called upon turning for home
and quickly drew off in a convincing effort. RUN POPPY pressed the pace to the quarter pole, could not go with the winner and kept-on willingly through the
lane to hold the place. CAPTAIN QUINT broke alertly, settled just off the pacesetter, chased the top pair throughout and was unable to get passed. SILVER
STYLE unhurried early on, saved ground on the turn and showed some late interest through the stretch. SAINTHOODFORBRIAN failed to menace.
SWIFTY DEVIL well placed for the first three-eighths and flattened out on the turn when called upon.

CHIEF RON unhurried early to track the four dueling pacesetters, circled five wide on the turn to engage the leader in mid-stretch and was up in the final
strides. THE DISTRACTOR lunged at the start, was gathered together, move up to the dueling leaders on the backside, battled through the turn, shook off
the other speed turning for home and battled through the stretch only to be out-finished late in a game effort. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY pressed the pace
from between rivals down the backside, was shuffled back entering the turn and kept-on in the lane to gain the show. JACKMAN broke sharply, taken in
hand to duel from three wide, made a bid on the turn and flattened out in the stretch. AGGRANDIZE hustled up the fence to take the lead under pressure
and gave way on the turn.

BAD HOMBRE stalked the pace to the far turn, saved ground on the final bend while racing in a clear pocket, cut the corner turning for home to take control
and held the closers safe through the lane. TIO TONY in tight at the start to be shuffled back to last, made a middle move down the backside to rush up into
contention while lacking racing room to further advance, idled on the turn losing ground, came again in upper stretch to threaten and finished evenly late in
the lane. BOTTOMLESS REFILL reserved off the pace for the first half mile, rallied on the turn three wide to loom in upper stretch and hung down the lane.
COMMISSION ALWAYS pressed the pace for a half mile and came up empty. ALABAMA SHAKE was not a threat. RETURN FIRE set a pressured pace for
three-quarters and gave way in mid-stretch.

PETINGAS TWIN stalked the pace to the turn, rallied five wide to engage the leader at the quarter pole, quickly cleared off from the field and continued to
draw away as much the best. SQUINTS tracked the pace to the top of the lane and rallied willingly in the stretch to be the best of the rest. DALINAR dueled
on the early lead to the turn, dropped back on the bend and kept-on evenly to gain the show. HEARD ON THESTREET broke a step slow to be the trailer
and passed weakened rivals coming home. LITTLE SKIPPY dueled on the lead to the turn, momentarily shook free on the bend and gave way when
challenged turning for home. MUAZARAH was not a threat.

BROWN SUGA BABE rated in mid-pack down the backstretch, rallied from three wide on the far turn, split rivals at the quarter pole, engaged the tiring
pacesetter in mid-stretch and drew away clearly best. MEMENTO MI unhurried for the first five-eighths, picked up ground on the turn, found best stride in
the lane to close well and be second best. ARGENTINA GIRL set the pace on a well rated, well measured lead, opened a clear lead nearing the quarter
pole, and drifted out turning for home while tiring, having no response when challenged in upper stretch. EXPECTING A WINNER prompted the pace for
three-quarters, drifted in turning for home while weakening and finihsed evenly through the lane. BOH'S N O'S pressed the early pace from the fence
through the first turn, settled off the leaders down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn while running evenly, took up at the head of the lane when rival
drifted in and had no closing kick. OSCAR GAZE was not a threat. LOUISE BROOKS stalked the pace from four wide the entire way and came up empty
turning for home. THE RIDER OF BOH'S N O'S CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE HEAD OF THE STRETCH BY EXPECTING A WINNER,

Footnotes
SEAX was slow into stride, roused around the bend, split rivals nearing the quarter pole, angled wide for the stretch run, engaged NEW JERSEY HEIST
from the outside, dueled with that rival through the final sixteenth, and won the bob at the wire. NEW JERSEY HEIST tracked the pace in a very clean
pocket into the turn, advanced four then five wide nearing the quarter pole, dueled inside SEAX through the final furlong, and lost the bob at the wire. ON
THE CHILL was under pressure from the start, dueled around the bend, lost ground while running on his left lead in upper stretch, swapped over to the right
lead and finished willingly to the wire. I WANNA ROCK raced off the pace and off the rail into the turn, gained ground while five wide leaving the quarter
pole, drifted out wider in upper stretch, closed the gap late, no threat to the leaders. MINNY SPEIGHTSTER off to a slow start, saved ground around the
bend, rail bid upper, split rivals late, finished willingly inside. TAJI MIKE chased the pace from between runners into the turn, bid between runners nearing
the quarter pole, was out kicked through the final furlong. INFINITE SERIES urged along the inside soon after the start, saved ground around the turn, came
up empty late. AGENT KELLY pressed the pace from the three path, called on turn, and gave way through the stretch. SALVO TRIGGER very slow into
stride, never threatened. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO
ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.
