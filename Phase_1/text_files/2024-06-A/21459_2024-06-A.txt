Footnotes
J R JONE Z set a pressured pace on the inside, then came two wide off the turn and was headed by the furlong marker but turned back that bid and edged
clear to prove best. WORK FROM HOME was bumped at the break, rated along the inside, then was two wide on the far turn behind the two front runners,
eased out and made a four wide bid off the turn to go on even terms for command by the furlong marker, came in a tad by the sixteenth marker and then
was corrected with a left handed crop but hung and had to settle for second best. SOCIAL JOE was bumped at the start, settled early and made way to the
rail, then advanced on the inside on the far turn and finished well on the inside , but needed more. UTILITY pressed the pace three wide and then faded in
the drive. SO SMOOTH tracked the early pace in between rivals into the first turn, then rated back and was two wide on the far turn, swung out five wide
leaving the turn but had no kick. TWIST OF FAITH broke in and bumped a rival, tracked the pace on the outside and tired.
