drive while battling with inner foes in the late stretch and was up in time to prove best. BABY OF THE FAMILY set the pace while two wide, cleared the turn
while being closing pursued by rivals, then drifted out in late stretch impeded outer foe then kept on grugundly and hung at the wire. SUMMER HELP

bumped by the drifting pace setter then kept ton determinedly and hung at the wire. AMERICAN FOREST chased the pace while three wide, then bid on the
turn and outside of rivals, was bumped by an outer foe heading into the stretch, then kept on while in a mild rally to no avail in the end. RIPSTER chased the

in the stretch and came up flat in the end. SALTAMONTES DIVA settled back along the inside and was no threat. JAN'S TURN TO WIN pressed the pace
from the inside while in a hard drive, was used up after the turn and weakened in the stretch. DIAMONDS N ACES was unhurried early, then pulled at the

up in the final strides to prevail. WINGS FOR ENO tracked the pace while two wide, then urged eagerly on the turn, came out four wide to menace in the
stretch and finished well for the place prize in the end. MY FAVORITE SONG raced in the middle of the fields along the rail, gain third position on the turn

avail in the end. TRUE AND READY showed the way from the inside, was challenged by an outer foe leaving the turn to duel briefly in the upper stretch,

ONE LAST BID laid off the pace along the rail in the back pair of rivals down the back stretch, then gained second position on the far turn while in a strong
bid, dug in gamely at the top of the stretch to tip by the pace setter and prevail in the end. TURQUOISE BLUE showed the way from the inside, maintained
the clear pace down the backstretch and into the far turn, was in a long drive in the late stretch then faltered in the end. LEAR chased the pace while two
wide in the back pair in the early furlongs, then bid on the far turn to gain third position in the upper stretch and held onto the show prize in the end.
CORREDOR tracked the pace from the inside at at moderated pace throughout and lacked rallying in the home stretch. DINERO DE LA CASA tracked the

BLUE LIGHT dueled with an outer foe down the backstretch and into the turn, was in an all out drive, disposed of said rival, then was met with SPEIGHT
AND MALICE in the late stretch to spar once again and was up at the wire to prevail. SPEIGHT AND MALICE stalked the pace from the inside down the
backstretch, then rallied leaving the turn to duel with BLUE LIGHT in the deep stretch and just missed victory in the end. EMPERADOR raced towards the
back while four wide and outside of rivals, was urging eagerly on the turn then was able to get up for the show position in the late stretch while in a mild rally.
ERNIE BANKER dueled with an inner foe in the early furlongs, was a long drive leaving the turn, was out bid by outer rivals and gave way in the end.
BANDERA AZTECA stalked the pace while two, then bid mildly on the turn before yielding in the stretch. TIZ LIFE stalked the dueling leaders while three
wide, then faded after the turn and lacked rallying in the stretch.

Footnotes
DESOTO'S WAR led the way along the inside into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch, cleared the far turn then drew off in the stretch to
prove much the best in the end. QUARTERBACK DAK stalked the pace while two wide and in second position throughout, lacked the winning bid in the
home stretch, bested the rest of the field and held the place prize in the end. LEVY tracked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then rallied on
the far turn to gain third position at the top of the stretch, could never catch the cleared leader and held onto the show prize in the end. JOHAN ZOFFANI
(IRE) broke inwardly then settled along the inside throughout the majority of the course, bid in the late stretch and made no impact in the end. SPECIAL
MOMENT was allowed to settle while two wide down the backstretch, then rallied on the far turn, came out and bumped rival in the upper stretch then kept
on while in a mild drive to no avail in the end. GIST was allowed to settle in the three path down the back stretch, then menaced on the far turn was bumped
by an inner foe at the top of the stretch and was no threat in the end. BIG ROJO broke outwardly then tracked the pace from the inside down the
backstretch, bid mildly on the far turn before fading in the stretch. BIG BROTHER failed to factor.

Footnotes
SIDETOWN showed the way from the inside into the turn, was in a determined drive down the lane while being pressured in the late stretch by hungry foes
and lasted to the wire to prevail. LARRY'S LEGEND stalked the pace from the inside into the turn, then menaced in early stretch and closed well just
missing the grand prize in the end. ELUSIVE D'ORO settled towards the back along the rail, then came out three wide leaving the turn and closed willingly
down the stretch just missing victory in the end. SUITABLE settled at the back while three wide, then came out five wide leaving the turn and rallied mildly in
the stretch to no avail in the end. ROCKING ROCKET moved up to press the pace while two wide, was in a hard drive on the turn could not overpower the
pace setter and gave way in the lane. GABARRA was urging eagerly between rivals early, then dropped back heading into the turn and was no menace.
CAJUN CHROME chased the pace while four wide, then bid on the turn outside of rival and did not fire in the stretch.
