MY BEST DAY EVER away alertly set the pace widening into upper stretch being ridden out as much the best. FRACING WILDCAT a step slow through the
turn rallied four wide down the lane angling in late a clear second best. HIGHWAY ROBBERY saved ground racing evenly throughout holding position late.
KETO FRIENDLY chased the pace to upper stretch wearing down there. TEXAS WENDY raced evenly failing to mount a credible bid. WOMP played no
factor. COUNTRY STYLE raced second flight tiring in upper stretch. MAYBE SARDONIC was never involved. MEOWSTIC was always outrun.
SAVANNAH'S STAR showed little.
