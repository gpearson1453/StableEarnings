KING OF HOLLYWOOD set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, responded when roused, edged away in the stretch run and dug in
gamely on the rail to the finish. WANDERING WEST raced three wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, moved up four wide at the quarter pole, rallied
wide into the stretch, closed outside in the final yards and got the nod for second. LOOKIN AT ROSES tracked close up on the inside, bid two wide on the
far turn, could not stay with the winner, then re rallied in the stretch and just missed for second. COCO SHELL pressed the pace in the early stages, then
chased and tired. DURKIN'S CALL bumped and steadied at the start, then steadied between rivals on the first turn, moved up four wide on the backside,
chased three wide on the far turn and faded. ANYTHING PAZIBLE bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
