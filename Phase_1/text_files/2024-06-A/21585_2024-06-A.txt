TROUBLE WITH SUGAR shared the command outside of HONEY PAT to near the quarter pole then edged away at the top of the stretch to prove best.
CHAPELLETE tracked the leaders from the inside to the top of the stretch then angled out to three wide for a late run to be second best. DOMINA stalked
the pace from three wide to the top of the stretch and made a mild bid but couldn't fend of the outside rival and stayed on for show. HONEY PAT shared the
command from two wide to near the quarter pole and tired. SHE'S MO FANCY was void of speed and trailed throughout.

the middle of the pack from between horses on the backstretch, made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker and cruised past the leaders for a brief
lead into the stretch but couldn't fend the outside closer and was a clear second. ROLLIN BLACKOUT co-led outside of GHOST BAYOU to the middle of the
final turn then she was eclipsed near the top of the stretch and tired. SHOW ME THE CANDY saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack through
the final turn then angled out to three wide in upper stretch but lacked a bid but improved her position. SUPER ET rubbed the gate and bumped LAYLA'S

middle of the pack from three wide and was not a factor. GHOST BAYOU co-led inside of ROLLING BLACKOUT to the middle of the final turn and stopped.

EVERYLITTLESINGH went to the front to a pressured inside pace and was challenged midway through the turn, matched strides with IN B. J.'S HONOR to
the wire and won the nod. IN B. J.'S HONOR pressed the pace from two wide to midway through the turn and engaged the leader, matched stride with
EVERYLITTLESINGH to the wire and gave way grudgingly. LITTLEBITOFAQUEEN stalked the pace from two or three wide to the turn then made a mild
bid but was no match for the dueling duo. RADIANT REBEL raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail, made a three wide bid at the three furlong
marker to move up on the turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. NIGHT TIZZY raced off the pace to the three furlong marker and faded. WICKED

J B GRAY dueled for the lead from three wide but was collared at the eighth pole by CAMPISI and fought back to draw clear. CAMPISI bobble slightly
leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the backstretch then made a four wide bid on the turn to collar the dueling trio to take a brief lead and fought gamely
but was outkicked in the final yards. PERFECT STAR dueled for the lead from two wide to the eighth pole and weakened but stayed on for the show. THE
THIMBLE trailed the field early then moved up from two wide on the turn, angled out to three wide in upper stretch and made the late rally. STOMPING
HOTROD dueled for the lead from the inside to the eighth pole and tired. DOUBLE TRAP chased the leaders but was not a factor. THE SANDY SURPRISE
raced near the back, saved ground around the turn but was never a threat.

up for the show. GOTTA DEAL raced off the pace on the inside through the final turn then moved between horses at the top of the stretch for the late effort
and just missed the show. RISING KOTO STAR rushed to the early lead around the first turn then vied for the lead from the inside to the three sixteenths
