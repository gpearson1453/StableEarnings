Footnotes
STACKS OF SILVER bumped at the start, pressed the pace along the rail, challenged for the lead along the backstretch, dueled through the stretch and
proved best under strong urging. VISUAL ARTIST vied early, fell back to stalk, challenged for the lead on the second turn, dueled through the stretch and
couldn't match strides with the winner. GREYZER was last away, unhurried early and raced in the back, advanced on the far turn and offered a mild bid to
be along for show. ALABAMA SLAMMER bumped at the start, was sent to the front and led around the first turn, vied to the second turn, fell back, swung
out, tired and stopped. GRAND PICK raced close to the pace, had nothing left for the drive and gave way. SPECTRIER was through early in an outside trip
and gave way. MY DANNY BOY was not a factor.

SUMMER SOLDIER raced close to the pace, bid between horses on the turn, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up at the wire. FLAMENCO
STAR dueled to deep stretch, inched away and was caught at the wire. ROUNDTOP raced inside, dueled to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. ZEVON
pressed the pace to the second turn and leveled off. SAISIR LE JOUR was never far off the pace, raced inside, bid off the rail and lacked the needed rally.
MAJOR MACK was rated back entering the first turn, raced close to the pace along the inside, bid off the rail and came up empty. PINEAPPLE LANE was
never far back, through early and faded. COININ broke slowly and trailed the field.

ORGANIZED CHAOS was hustled along to set the pace and drew off in the drive under mild urging. KINGDOM QUEEN was never far back, raced outside,
closed steadily, couldn't gain ground, was no match for the winner and held for place. BOUND BY DESTINY broke out and bumped at the start, was slow
early, went widest in the drive, finished well and earned show. SHE'S BULLETPROOF was never far back, lacked a late response and failed to menace.
ROYAL SEAMSTRESS was bumped and squeezed at the start, pressed the pace to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. MISS STONES
broke in and bumped at the start, stalked the pace to the turn and gave way. ONLY KIDDING lagged inside, lacked a bid and was outrun.

Footnotes
BELLE OF RIGHTS raced mid pack along the inside, rallied in traffic on the turn, closed willingly and drew clear late. SOURCE (GB) broke slowly, was
unhurried early and raced in the back, advanced inside on the turn, bid off the rail, angled out and closed to get up for place. JUST GREAT broke out,
stalked the pace to the second turn, assumed command, inched clear, was outclosed and settled for show. WHISPERING SEA held a good position, bid
and came up empty. DOESN'THURTTOFLIRT broke out and bumped at the start, was unhurried early and saved ground, bid on the second turn, was
checked and dropped back. KAMIKAZE UMAGI raced mid pack in an even effort and lacked the needed rally. YOU CAN'T WIN broke in and bumped at the
start, raced in the back and lacked a bid. SURPRENANT COCCA veered out at the start, lagged outside and lacked a stretch response. LOVE TO EAT
stalked the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. HEKATE set the pace while racing in hand, tired on the turn and stopped. The rider of
DOESN'THURTTOFLIRT claimed foul against the rider of BELLE OF RIGHTS for alleged interference on the turn. No change was made.

Footnotes
JOHN'S PROMISE quick away from the gate, settled off the top flight four wide, bid four wide nearing the quarter pole, moved out six wide through the
stretch, and held sway late under a drive. RED DEVOLUTION tracked the pace from along the rail, angled off the inside nearing the quarter pole, shifted
back inside nearing the furlong marker, and finished willingly inside the winner. CLASSY SOLUTION tracked the pace four wide into the turn, under a drive
seven wide, rallied late to gain the show. RAHMER very slow into stride, under a steady drive around the turn, shifted outside in upper stretch, closed the
gap very late. FLAT LUCKY ground saving trip from off the pace, bid upper stretch, finished with interest along the inside. MR. MOX chased the pace setters
from between rivals around the bend, under a drive in upper stretch, out kicked through the wire. TOUCHDOWN MONTAGE vied in the two path for the
lead, under pressure in upper stretch, weakened late. MY BEAU slow into stride, urged along entering the turn, and never threatened. POSITIVELY
AWESOME vied inside into the turn, steady urging around the bend, gave way stretch.
