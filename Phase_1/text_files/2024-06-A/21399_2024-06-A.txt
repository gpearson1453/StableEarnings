Footnotes
QUINCANNON disputed the pace outside PUDGE BOY PALACE while confidently handled, responded when set down inside the eighth pole, raced on her
left lead the final sixteenth of a mile and prevailed with something in reserve. LAW OF THE JUNGLE saved ground on the turn, swung outside in mid stretch
and rallied. PUDGE BOY PALACE stayed on the inner rail, disputed the pace to the eighth pole then gave way. HE'S ON FIRE remained along the inner rail
around the turn and failed to rally. HACHURE , kept three to four wide around the turn, retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
LITTLE JOSIE WALES , in a bit close at the break, quickly recovered and secured the inside, raced in mid pack an under some coaxing mid turn, advanced
inside and under a solid ride in mid stretch, bid to the inside of MOLLIE TAPPER to take over a sixteenth out then drew clear. MOLLIE TAPPER accelerated
to the inside of a pair of runner and took over early, shook clear leaving the far turn, widened under a drive while off the rail in mid stretch, could not contain
the winner's inside bid, faded but managed to save the place. CONCRETE FAZE was squeezed back from between rivals leaving the gate, regrouped and
settled well back while saving ground, eased out into the lane then worked between foes, shifted well out in the course for the final sixteenth and finished
well. KAPATUDE chased three wide outside the winner mdi turn, moved up between foes near the sixteenth pole, angled out a bit late and continued with
interest. HIDEWRIGHT AWAY broke a step slow, rushed up between foes soon after then steadied briefly near the half, pursued four wide mid turn, angled
to the rail in upper stretch but lacked the needed finish. SEAP had speed between foes then rated back off the leaders heading towards the turn, saved
ground into the lane, eased out past the quarter pole, gave chase to about the sixteenth marker then weakened. IRISH RAGE , bumped at the break, raced
between rivals mid turn, swung out in the drive but came up empty. CHAMPAGNE DANCE drifted in some and bumped with a rival, raced off the pace three
deep, swung well wide for the drive but lacked a bid. STOLEN LAUGHTER had speed three deep, forced the pace outside the leader, drifted a bit inside mid
turn then weakened. DIVINE MAGIC , inside under a ride, failed to respond.

SAFE TRUST bore in at the break, sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail while disputing the pace and drew off late. AUDIBLE THE PLAY battled
outside the winner and finished gamely. ITSAMONSTAMASH , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened the final furlong. MAP TO THE
MOON , three wide on the turn, was not a factor. SUNFLOWER STATE trailed to the stretch, swung very wide in upper stretch and showed a late move.
GOOD MORNING MERCY bore out leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on the turn and was checked in close quarters when attempting to get
out at the head of the stretch. BEYOND QUESTION , pinched back leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
ANAITA took over between rivals in the opening furlong, set a rated pace in about the two path while handling outside pressure, spurted clear after being
roused in upper stretch, kept on under right handed asks leaving the sixteenth marker, was confronted from her outside by TRANSLATE and dug in
tenaciously to prevail. TRANSLATE settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out some in upper stretch, split foes nearing the sixteenth pole, shifted
out a bit to challenge the winner, kept on gamely but was denied. THEODORA GRACE , away to a brief lead, rated back off outer foes and stalked inside,
remained inside with aim in the drive but went evenly through the final furlong. POUNDING MUSIC settled off the pace and outside a rival, angled five wide
soon into the stretch, shifted back in past mid stretch and churned on. SMOOTH PEBBLE broke outward and was away a step slow, corrected and pulled
her way forward, attended the pace three wide outside the winner, failed to kick on with that on leaving mid stretch, switched over to her left lead and
weakened through the final sixteenth. A GIRL NAMED JAC , two to three wide between rivals, raced close up into the lane, was under asking in mid stretch
and faded. GOLDEN CAN , three deep stalking the pace, shifted further out in upper stretch, chased and gave way.

Footnotes
MATTITUDE set a pressured pace near the inner rail around the turn, went clear while drifting out in mid stretch then lasted while drifted out late. MAMA
G'S WISH , lapped outside the winner, prompted that one around the track and closed late to just miss. BRZINA stalked the pace while saving ground on
the turn, eased off the rail entering the stretch, swung very wide in upper stretch and rallied. BOURBON WILDCAT circled horses on the turn, chased the
pace, was fanned very wide in upper stretch and lacked a rally. HALEIGH B saved ground around the turn, remained along the inner rail in the stretch and
was no factor. DULCE KIARA , always far off the inner rail, weakened and was eased late.

Footnotes
THEGIRLFROMIRELAND stumbled at the break, recovered and settled in the clear while about three wide, took closer order into the far turn, gained four
wide and engaged rivals approaching the stretch, responded when set down soon after and took command outside EXCEPT TEMPTATION, wandered
outward leaving mid stretch, corrected with right handed asks then dug in to deny CHELICHNA to her inside. CHELICHNA settled off the pace and removed
from the inside, was nudged along three to four wide following the winner into the lane, took to firmer encouragement past the three sixteenths then closed
gamely inside the winner. EXCEPT TEMPTATION prompted the pace three wide outside the leader, moved to apply more pressure exiting the far turn,
gained a slim lead into the lane, battled inside the winner from the three sixteenths to late then gave way grudgingly. NEXT GIRL , two wide early on,
dropped back to last after six furlongs, swung out five wide for the drive and found more to gain through the final furlong. IMAGINETHEODDS secured the
inside into the first turn, rated close up through the backstretch, eased out with pursuit past the quarter pole, shifted further out past mid stretch and faded.
CONGRESS HALL dropped inside soon after the start, was unhurried early on, stayed inside into the lane, came out near mid stretch but lacked a serious
finish. BEAUTIFUL GORGEOUS rated off the pace and off the inside, edged up some leaving the far turn, angled out under a ride near the three sixteenths
but failed to kick on. MIDSUMMERS EVE took over early and set the pace towards the inside, took pressure leaving the far turn, battled inside rivals into the
lane then weakened in the final furlong.

PLAY HARDER prompted the pace three deep around the turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch, was challenged on his outside by THE BAND RUNS
ON in upper stretch, battled and tenaciously prevailed. THE BAND RUNS ON stalked the duel for five furlongs, eased out wide leaving the turn, bid for the
lead outside PLAY HARDER in upper stretch, dueled and hung. DERBYNESS came out a bit at the break, lacked speed, swung to the five path near the
three sixteenths pole and rallied. CAP COM disputed the early pace between horses, remained prominent inside the top pair in mid stretch and faded late.
GOODBYE NOTE showed speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace to the stretch, gave way and was eased late. PASSIONED stalked the early pace
while along the inner rail and faltered turning for home. INCINERATOR , steadied and pinched back leaving the starting gate, raced outside horses down
the backstretch, faltered leaving the turn and was eased.

DAZZLING MOVE tracked the dueling leaders three to four wide, moved up in hand to threaten past the three eighths, took over from PLANET CLARE into
the lane, kicked clear past the quarter pole, spurted away after being roused, kept on under strong encouragement inside the sixteenth pole then dug in to
fend off GO SHERRY GO. GO SHERRY GO rated forwardly while saving ground, eased out mid turn, shifted out and circled five wide into the lane, made a
game and grinding run through the final furlong but just could not reel in the winner. PLANET CLARE broke inward bumping DETERMINED PRINCESS,
corrected and moved up between runners leaving the chute then contested the pace outside STORMY MIDNIGHT, poked a head in front leaving the far
turn, maintained a slim advantage heading towards the lane, gave in to the winner leaving the quarter pole, shifted in towards the rail then weakened
through the final sixteenth. DETERMIND PRINCESS , bumped and in tight leaving the gate, recovered and settled well back, gained three to four wide past
the three eighths, chased the leaders into the lane then gave way. MADDIE TEN , bumped at the start, was taken to rate early on, raced three to four wide
into the lane then came up empty. STORMY MIDNIGHT took over early then was guided inward, sparred with PLANET CLARE into the turn, failed to go on
nearing the lane and tired.

RICCIO set the pace well off the inner rail, went clear approaching the far turn, remained off the rail and was kept to his business in the drive. CROSSLAND
showed speed along the inner rail for a half mile, swung outside leaving the backstretch then willingly chased the winner. SNEAKING SUSPICION broke
slowly, trailed to the stretch then split horses approaching the sixteenth pole. JARDANI stalked the pace racing along the inner rail and weakened. MINT
GAME , three wide the far turn, was not a factor.

TWO MINUTE LICK , three to four wide stalking the pace, was under a firm ride from the five sixteenths, kept grinding through the final furlong and just got
up at the wire. FLINNY TIN TIN cleared early, set a rated pace towards the inside, was guided three wide and let out in upper stretch, widened a bit past mid
stretch, kept on gamely but was edged at the wire. MUCHO MACHO MRYTLE prompted the pace while saving ground, came under a ride near the three
eighths, shifted out five wide for the drive and churned on. G'S FIREBALL tracked the pace two wide, was under pressure near the quarter pole, failed to
kick on leaving the three sixteenths and weakened. SEARCH broke slowly, saved ground off the pace and failed to respond. SOMETHING SILLY , between
rivals early, dropped back near the half then failed to generate a run.
