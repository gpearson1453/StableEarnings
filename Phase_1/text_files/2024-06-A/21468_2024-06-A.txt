Footnotes
LIGHTENING MO slow into stride leaving the gate, moved up the fence to stalk the pace after getting together, waited on the fence in the turn for racing
room, tipped out turning for home and pulled away convincingly in the lane. CIRCLE UP reserved off the pace in the back flight, rallied along the fence
saving ground, angled to the clear in mid-stretch and finsihed well as second best. RUNTOLIVE tracked the leaders from three wide early, dropped back to
be near the rear of the field down the backside, ralied five wide coming home and finished evenly. TALKABOUT set apressured pace to the quarter pole and
weakened in the lane. TAKE HER AWAY pressed the pace fro a half and gave way. MY SUGAR FIX was not a threat.

GIRL THIRSTY unhurried in the early going to trail, moved to a tracking position in the five path down the backstretch, rallied five wide turning for home and
closed best of all to prevail. SIKARA SIKARA stalked the pace from the inside to the far turn, saved ground cutting the corner coming for home and finsihed
well up the fence. DIXIE FARMER prompted the pace for five-eighths, assumed command turning for home, opened a clear advantage mid-stretch and was
out-finished late in the drive. COURTLY DOC was no threat going evenly. MS. CAJUN QUEEN set a pressured pace to the far turn and faded.

SCHNELL tracked the leaders for the first quarter, dropped back losing position on the turn, angled off the fence to six wide and closed with a late rush to be
up in time. BARAHIN pressed the pace to the turn, took a short lead dueling through the stretch, shook off all the challengers only to be nailed in the final
jump by the late clsoer. TRAELEE dueled on the pace from three wide between rivals to the turn, pressed the runner-up down the lane and weakened late
in the drive. MIND ON MY MONEY pressed the pace from between, kept-on willingly while unable to sustain through the stretch. TAPPIN FORA DANCE
contended through out and lacked a closing rally. HONOR MY SPEED leapt at the start to trail early, rushed up five wide to be part of the pace into the turn
and flattened out. APPLEWOOD was not a factor.

SIX STRING pressed the pace to the head of the lane, kept-on determinedly when kicked away from in upper stretch and came on to wear the pacesetter
dow in deep stretch. SWEET TEMPERAMENT set a pressured pace on a well measured lead, responded when called upon turning for home to widen the
advantage, drifted out down the lane while tiring and was out-finished in deep stretch. RUE LALA settled off the dueling leaders through the turn, mounted a
five wide rally on the turn and failed to sustain the bid. JUMPIN JUDY stalked the pace to the turn, ranged up three wide to threaten on the bend and
flattened out coming home.

the pace to the far turn and mounted a mild bid to be along for the show. MAX IS G MONEY stalked the pace the entire way and lacked a closing response.
WHITE ICE slow early to be the trailer and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. DEVIL'S HARVEST set the pace while well rated on a measured lead to the top
of the lane and weakened through the stretch. SUMMER LOVER was not a threat. DUMBSTRUCK was not a factor. GREAT RUNNER tracked the leaders

Footnotes
CHARGED UP ROSE sprinted off to a clear lead down the backside, was given a breather on the turn as the field closed in, responded when called upon
turning for home to re-open a clear lead and held well to the wire. SAUCY GEM reserved off the pace through the turn, angled five wide at the top of the
lane and finished with good interest to be gaining late. FAYE L. stalked the pace to the turn, rallied on the bend to threaten and was outkicked in the lane.
ARTIE'S DEAL raced mid-pack throughout showing some late interest in the stretch to be best of the rest. GIRL LIKES BLING tracked the leaders through
the turn and faded coming home. PARDAY was not a threat. FIVE LEAF CLOVER broke outward while tossing head, continued to race with head up and
rank down the backstretch, chased the pack ihrough the turn and tired in the stretch.
