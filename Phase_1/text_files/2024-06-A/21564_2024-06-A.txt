SISTER CODE stalked the pace down the backstretch, surged three wide to make the lead entering the turn, set the balance of the pace and finished full of
run to win as much the best under a strong hand ride. LUNA PRIMAVERA pressed the pace two wide into the turn then was no match for the winner but
gamely gained second. LIME TREE offered a mild bid three wide into the stretch then was outfinished. CAP IS BACK trailed down the backstretch and
passed tiring rivals outside. GARDEN SECRETS was no factor. ZULLY BELLA was no threat. OH ATLANTA bobbled at the start, set a pressured pace
along the inside into the turn then weakened. DIMPLED was through early.

late in the five path. CRYPTO COPY chased the winner three then two wide and faded in the stretch. OUR BUCKWHEAT bobbled at the start and was no
factor. MAS ORO chased the winner two wide and was through after a half.
