ROSIE'S ANGUS broke in slightly at the start, raced in mid pack early while saving ground, angled out to the six path through the second turn, was steadily
closing, took control late stretch and edged clear for the win. DAISY DE ORO pressed the early pace, raced three wide into the second turn, opened up
early stretch, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. SKY HIGH SUSAN was taken back back early, advanced seven wide through the
second turn, was gaining late and was along for third. LILY'S CREED was reserved early, raced five wide into the second turn, angled in late and finished
evenly. JESS'S RAINBOW was allowed to settle early, raced four wide into the second turn and weakened. STRAWBERRY SUNDAE set a pressured early
pace from the inside and faded. EMILYHASHERTURN was void of any early speed, raced three wide through the second turn and offered no late rally.
GIANT TUDE was outrun early, went four wide into the second turn and never fired. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND
