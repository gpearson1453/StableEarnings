Footnotes
ALTAZOR (ARG) trailed, rallied in the four path, went to the six path at the quarter pole and surged late under steady urging. BENCH dueled inside of a
rival, led inside at the quarter pole, was joined by a rival and dueled inside of that one and was caught late by the winner. THE PROCESS stalked the pace
between rivals, bid at the three-eighths pole, dueled in the stretch and was caught at the wire. MOMS MOON stalked the pace inside, bid on the far turn,
was blocked, angled to the four path, went back to the rail and couldn't close late. CANDY NUN raced well back and bid belatedly. IRONSIDES stalked the
pace in the four path, rallied at the half, drew even at the top of the stretch but faltered. DOUBLE YOUR MONEY saved ground, angled out three wide in the
stretch and failed to menace. HEALING WATERS dueled outside of a rival and faded in the stretch. EL CUERVO FELIS saved ground and gave way near
the half-mile pole.

Footnotes
FRIAR NEWTON pressed the pace in the four path, rallied at the three-eighths pole, came in slightly late and won driving. ADMIRAL BOUCHARD led
inside, brushed and checked late. DYNAMIS pressed the pace in the three path and gave way at the quarter pole. GLENBROOK GERRY stalked the pace
in the three path while fading in the stretch. BEACH COWBOY stalked the pace in the two path and then gave way. UNCLE TUFFY was unrushed inside
and faded. ONLY FRANK KNOWS was not a factor. THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF ADMIRAL BOUCHARD
AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH.
