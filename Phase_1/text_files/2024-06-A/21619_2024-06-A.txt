Footnotes
COLONEL BARTON raced mid pack between rivals, remained well rated along the rail on the turn, then dug in gamely at the top of the stretch to edge past
the pace setter in the final yards and prevail in the end. TAKE ACTION emerged to set the pace down the backstretch along the rail, was able to clear the
turn while being pursued by an outside rival, was in a long drive in the late stretch then yielded in the final yards. BIG PAPER DADDY raced mid pack while
three wide, was in a strong drive on the turn then steadied avoiding fallen rival, re rallied in the upper stretch and was best for the show prize in the end.
TAKE FLIGHT was allowed to settle along the rail towards the back, then checked up on the turn and came up empty. UNCLE NICK raced at the tail of the
field early, then urged eagerly on the turn while three wide, steadied sharply, re bid in the stretch and came up empty in the end. DO YOUR JOB pursued
the pace from the inside early, then steadied back heading into the turn, was impeded and unseated rider and walked off in the end. BOARD CERTIFIED
was impeded on the turn, unseated rider and walked off in the end. MO TAP pursued the pace from the two path, then stumbled on the turn, unseated rider,
impeded rivals and was vanned off.

late stretch to prove best in the end. SUCCESSFULPATH was away well to prompt the pace from the two path, was in a steady drive on the turn to gain

TOOTIE chased the pace from inside, continued to bid close being the leaders on the turn, rallied at the top of the stretch and was about to get up for the
show position in the late stretch while in a mild rally. BLUSHING BELLE was bumped by an inner foe at the start, then bid from the inside to set the pace
down the backstretch and into the turn, was overtaken by an outer foe at the quarter pole and gave way in the end. IZATIZ broke outwardly and bumped

Footnotes
ONE LAST THING vied briefly between rivals before gaining command heading into the turn, was in a strong drive while being pursued by eager foes, but
kept on down the lane while in a determined rally to last until the end prevailing overall. NO MO WHINING was bumped dramatically at the start, then
hustled up to pursue the leading trio from the inside, was advancing from the three path on the turn to gain second position in the early stretch but could not
catch the determined leader in the end. IMPOVERISHED vied for the lead briefly from the inside before stalking the emerging leader into the turn, dug in
gamely in the upper stretch, could not overcome ONE LAST THING and was out finished for the place prize. CHROME CANDY veered outwardly and
bumped rival at the start, was allowed to settle while two wide towards the back, came out three to four wide leaving the turn and kept on while in a mild rally
to no avail in the end. IRON MOON was allowed to settle at towards the tail of the field, then rallied mildly leaving the turn and came up empty in the end.
YOU TIME pressed the pace while three wide, then continued to stalk the leader while in a hard drive on the turn, was used up and tired in the stretch. RAFI
C broke slightly inwardly then trailed throughout and was no factor.

stretch under left handed encouragement and cut off rival and was up at the wire. CAFE AU LAIT was unhurried early, then steadily gain ground from the
inside on the turn, dug in gamely at the top of the stretch, was cut off by the leader, steadied, regained stride and kept on to the wire. TENSAS BOLT

was out finished for the place prize in the end. SECRET VERSE broke outwardly, then chased the pace while three wide, menaced on the turn and came up
flat in the stretch. GOODNESS was fractious in the gate, then bid from the inside before dropping back at the tail of the field, bid leaving the turn was no
menace in the end. IN SPITE OF IT was brushed at the start, then raced mid pack while four wide and outside of rivals, bid on the turn and was no threat in
the end. LA RONALDA Y G chased the pace while two wide, then bid on the turn and lacked rallying in the stretch. SILIVAS tucked along the inside towards
the back, then steadied off the heels of rival leaving the turn and was no menace. There was INQUIRY in regards to interference in the late stretch, After

Footnotes
KENTUCKY DAWN remained well rated while two wide down the backstretch, then urged steadily on the far turn along the rail, shifted out three wide and
found the best stride in the late stretch to be up at the wire. THIRD STREET laid off the pace while three wide mid pack in the early stages, then bid on the
far turn, dug in gamely in the upper stretch and closed well just missing victory in the end. DEVIL'S MISCHIEF was forwardly placed headed into the first
turn to track the pace from the two path down the backstretch, then bid past the pace setter on the far turn, to duel with SHARP LORENZO in the upper
stretch, was in an all out drive then was out finished by outer foes and hung third. SHARP LORENZO moved from the inside to track the pace down the
backstretch, bid on the far turn while clearing the pace setter then dueled with an outer foe in the early stretch, gained command by a head in the final yards
while in a determined drive then was caught in the end. LOUIS THE CHAMP chased the pace from the inside mid pack, continued to save ground on the far
turn, then rallied in the stretch but it was not enough in the end. NO TROUBLE was allowed to settle towards the back while two wide, then rallied too little
too late in the end. BANDERA BLING was unhurried early and no threat. MAGICAL MARK led the way from the inside into the first turn to set the pace
down the backstretch while two wide, was in a long drive heading into the far turn, was overpowered by rivals from both sides then retreated.

Footnotes
BROTHER REID pursued the pace from the inside into the first turn, then tracked the pace down the backstretch while being well rated, then angled out to
the four path leaving the far turn, and edged clear in the late stretch to be up in the final strides. GOLD PRIZE saved ground in the early furlongs, bid while
two wide on the far turn, split rivals, then closed well in the late stretch to be up for the place earnings in the end. SARA'S SHAMAN battled with inner rivals
throughout the first half, was in a steady drive to clear one rival heading into the far turn, was met with another counterpart from the outside to vie between
rivals, gained command in the upper stretch then was out finished in the end. SOLID COUNTRY GOLD broke inwardly, was allowed to settle between rivals
at the back, then menaced while three wide on the far turn and kept on in the stretch while in a mild drive. GOOD SWIMMER battled for the lead between
rivals into the backstretch, was in a long drive while continuing to vie from the inside on the far turn, was used up and gave way in the final yards. MOON
CAT stalked the leading trio while four wide down the backstretch, then inched up on the far turn to contend with the remaining inner duo, lacked the winning
bid and gave way in the lane. FIGHT'N READY tucked along the inside towards the back down the backstretch, then bid mildly leaving the far bend and
made no impact in the end. OPTIMUS KAT raced mid pack while three wide down the backstretch, then rallied on the far turn and needed more in the
stretch . MUFFIN NUTS was no menace. NIGHTWIND vied for the lead from the inside and with two outer foes into the first turn and down the backstretch,
could not retain bid on the far turn and flattened out in the final stages.
