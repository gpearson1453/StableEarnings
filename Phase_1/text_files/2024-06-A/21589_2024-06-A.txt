gaining second. TAP VALLEY battled for the lead three then two wide until deep stretch and was outfinished. MO SNOW failed to menace.

GRAY TORMENTOR with the second flight, responded readily when set down, rallied four wide under right handed urging to make the lead past mid stretch
and drew off to win going away. EL SORDO also with the second flight, closed rapidly through the turn to make the lead before the quarter pole, set the
pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. ITSMYLUCKYCOYNE made the lead shortly after the start, gave up the advantage two wide
before a quarter, kept pressure, gained a narrow advantage before the quarter pole then weakened late. WINGS OF HEAVEN was bumped at the start, vied
for the lead along the inside and lacked the needed response. BUCKEYE MIKE was bumped repeatedly from his outside at the start into WINGS OF
HEAVEN, rushed up the rail to make the lead before a quarter, set the pace into the turn then was used up. SKUNK APE bore in bumping BUCKEYE MIKE
repeatedly at the start then trailed.

CHANNEL FURY stalked the pace near the inside into the turn, shifted out, surged to the lead four wide at the top of the stretch and drew off under a strong
hand ride to win as much the best. TIME TO SHOOT allowed to settle, had a mild late rally five wide and finished second best. STATESBORO unhurried
early, found his best stride late four wide. FREE SAILIN pressed the pace three wide into the stretch then was outfinished. SO DIALED IN prompted the
pace two wide into the stretch and faded late. DOCTOR WU trailed until deep stretch and passed tiring rivals outside. GOOD ON YA settled mid pack and
lacked the needed response. AYE AYE SIR set a pressured pace along the inside to the top of the stretch and weakened late. FAT DADDY was no factor.

Footnotes
BRIG prompted the pace two wide down the backstretch, inherited the lead entering the turn, quickly drew off, widened into the stretch and won as much the
best under confident handling. BISCUITS AND GRITS never far back, had a mild late rally in the four path and finished clear for second. GIFT OF OAK
unhurried early, found his best stride late in the five path. RUMBLE STRIP RON allowed to settle, moved up two wide through the turn and into the stretch
then came up empty. RED HOT POWER chased the pace in the four path and weakened in the stretch. SURROUNDER close up along the inside, was
through after a half. BEAT THE DEALER was outrun. BAD BOY BOOGIE set the pace along the inside for three furlong, had speed through the turn then
stopped.
