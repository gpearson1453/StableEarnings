and got up in the final strides. MOMMA K'S BOY bore in bumping hard with COUNTEVERYBLESSING at the start, stalked the pace in the five path for a
half, assumed command at the three furlong marker, drew well clear in upper stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. KENNEDY'S
CAMELOT unhurried early, found his best stride late in the five path. COUNTEVERYBLESSING was bumped hard at the start, trailed into the stretch,
swung wide and passed tiring rivals. LUCKY VICTOR bore out at the start, sprinted to a clear lead on the clubhouse turn, set the pace for five furlongs then

eights pole, altered course three wide, vied for the lead, angled inside the winner at the top of the stretch, shifted outside that one at the sixteenth pole, dug
in gamely and just missed. LAST COOKIE close up along the inside, swung out to the middle of the racetrack entering the stretch then closed fast in the
final stages to also be narrowly beaten while three wide. QUICK QUICK WHIT had good early speed inside, was bumped by the winner near the nine

Footnotes
STONE COLD CAT trailed down the backstretch, responded readily when set down, circled his field five wide to make the lead in deep stretch and drew
clear under a strong hand ride. MUCHO PRIMO dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, shook clear before the furlong marker then was no match for
the winner. AFLEET O ME never far back, finished with good courage along the rail. OL' L B well placed, failed to respond. CRAZYCANTBERIGHTED had
good early speed then faded. ATTACK ANGLE battled for the lead along the inside past the quarter pole, shifted out to the four path then gave way late.
