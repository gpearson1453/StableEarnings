Footnotes
WAR BEAT rated along under a hold between rivals early, confidently handled three deep near the quarter pole, shifted out seven wide through the upper
lane and finished well to edge up under strong handling. CHARGE OFF tracked the top trio near the rail, asked just off the inside through the far turn, dug
two deep late and kept on gamely to the wire. INTERNAL CAPITAL raced four wide around the first turn, raced mid pack from the outside of rivals down the
backstretch, moved up five wide around the far turn and finished willingly to the wire. OLD FLAG (IRE) settled off the early going, was blocked near the five
sixteenths pole, fanned wide into the upper stretch and closed in belatedly in a game effort. AMBOR NIGHT dropped back to race mid pack, race two three
wide in the stretch run and had no final winning bid. DONTBESOOGROUCHY settled off the early going, ridden into the far turn, fanned wide into the upper
stretch and had no late rally. IMMENSE FAITH was bumped at the start, prompt the pace three deep, raced in tight between near the three sixteenths pole
and weakened a bit. ADMIRAL'S WAVE raced with the second flight early on, slightly bumped while being fanned wide into the upper stretch and was even
with no closing run. SAM STORMY prompt the early leader two deep from the outside and faded. INTO YOU set a pressured early pace near the inside and
faded. NOBLE STAR trailed early on and failed to threaten.

hand ride. SAND WEDGE sent to a clear early lead felt pressured past the quarter pole, was collared near the three sixteenths pole, kept on but was no
match for the winner. IT'S ONLY WORDS angled in down the backstretch, raced near the rail around the far turn and raced along for third as was no match
for the top pair. LIGHTNING DUST chased the top trio, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and weakened a bit through the drive. SHILOH hard
ridden two deep near the quarter pole and lost ground while racing off the inside. WORRIES UNFOUNDED was off slowly, trailed early on after the poor

and finished gamely to the wire. OISHI stalked the pace near the inside, eased out through the far turn, raced four wide into the upper stretch and finished
gamely to the wire. ECHO LANE settled off the early going racing in hand, raced six wide into the upper stretch and was even with no closing run.

SIR BANANA BRIAN quick to begin to clear off to a clear early lead and held well through the drive to prove best under handling. VINICIO chased the early
pace while being coaxed along, raced near the inside around the far turn, angled out and finished gamely to the wire. YASUR urged along early, had an
inside around the far turn into the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. JAKE'S AFFECTION dropped back to race mid pack, loomed four to five wide
around the far turn and flattened out in the drive. PAISAN raced off the early pace, was three deep around the far turn and had no response. SVAR raced in
tight quarters soon after the break, trailed the field early on, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. VENEZUELAN FEELING angled in
down the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn through the stretch and never threatened. ALPHA BLUE prompt the early leader from the outside
and faded.

racing five wide. VENEZUELAN FAITH stalked the pace between rivals down the backstretch, raced three wide into the upper stretch and weakened a bit in
the latter stages. MALIBU MIKE raced mid pack early on, angled in down the backstretch, raced from the inside into the upper stretch and had not enough
in the drive. SIR DANIEL was off a step slow, raced near the back of the pack early, raced four wide around the far turn and was even in the drive with no
closing run. CANDY STREET stalked the pace from the outside of rivals, raced four wide around both turns and weakened late. CHANGEORDERSONNY
