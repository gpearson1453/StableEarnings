Footnotes
LANETTA rated close inside on the first turn, raced hemmed in through the backstretch and the far turn, eased out entering the stretch, bid for the lead
mid-stretch and held on well with steady handling. DASHING LASS settled back in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and bid nearing the three
eighths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn, dueled for second inside the sixteenth pole and was gaining slowly on the winner. GONE WITH THE
WYN rounded the first turn about the five path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close four wide on the far turn and ran evenly in the stretch. LADY
CINCO DE MAYO rated close about the three path, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the nod approaching the quarter pole, raced in the
three path on the far turn, was met mid-stretch and flattened inside the sixteenth pole. LINDA'S TAJ took over nearing the three quarter pole and moved to
the inside to show the way, came under pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, was caught toward the quarter, raced at the rail on the far turn and
weakened. PAMZ PALACE raced off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and
showed little in the lane. MRS. SPEAKER raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
ZEN MASTER steadied early and raced in the four path on the opening turn, rallied to the lead at the three eights pole, cleared rivals toward the five
sixteenths, widened at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert in the lane. BIG ROWDY DAN stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing
the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold second. GROUP EIGHTEEN settled off the rail the first turn, gave
chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and ran evenly in the lane. AWARD NOMINATED saved ground on the
first turn, moved to the outside past the half mile pole and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths, raced in the three path on the far turn and ran
evenly in the lane. MONTAUK DADDY rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, gave up the lead and gave chase
passing the pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. ROCKET APPEAL stalked inside on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole,
steadied at the rail past the five sixteenths and weakened on the far turn. INSIDE RISK raced in the five path the first turn, moved to the inside past the half
mile pole but showed little response through the backstretch. ELEVATED FOREVER broke awkwardly and was roughed leaving the gate, raced in the five
path the first turn, stalked into the backstretch and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, but weakened in the six path on the far turn.

Footnotes
CAFFEINENNICOTINE stalked the early pace three wide, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn,
dueled to the lead passing the eighth pole and was steadily handled to hold on well. YOUTHFUL ENERGY settled in the four path the first turn, bid nearing
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and dueled to clear second later yards. SWIPED THE CASTLE took over nearing the three
quarter pole and tapered to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, gave up the lead past
the eighth pole, weakened mid-stretch and just lasted for third. DEFIANT GIANT exchanged contact with Hurricane Alert leaving the gate and was jostled
about the same time, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, improved from that point and raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the
lane. MR. DUMBLEDORE rounded the first turn about the three path, left the turn outside and gave chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the three
path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. CECIL THE GREAT raced off the rail the first turn, moved to the outside into the backstretch, gave chase
from the three eighths pole but flattened in the five path on the far turn. HURRICANE ALERT exchanged contact with Defiant Giant leaving the gate then
stalked inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. W V LAD exchanged contact with Defiant Giant leaving
the gate then stalked off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. GRANDY saved
ground.

Footnotes
BONNIE BLUETOOTH bore out leaving the gate then stalked inside on the opening turn, started her bid past the half mile pole and raced close two deep on
the far turn, took the lead mid-stretch and edged away later yards. BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD was crowded at the break then saved ground, bid leaving the
three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and dueled through the stretch to take second late yards. SECRET CASTLE rounded the first turn about
the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
ARROWWOOD was forced out leaving the gate then saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on
the far turn and flattened in the lane. EMBERLY moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, contested the
edge nearest the rail on the far turn but gave up the lead mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. CASTLE OF CAYLEE was not a factor. SNEAKY
LYNK stalked the early pace off the rail, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
GREAT SPIRIT gave chase through the backstretch and raced close in the four path on the turn, drifted leaving the turn, dug in to match strides with
MAGGIE'S GIRL in later yards and inched ahead nearing the wire. The latter gave chase and took the lead two deep midway on the turn, dug in under
steady handling leaving the turn but grudgingly ceded in the closing yards. OVERNIGHT POW WOW steadied early then chased toward the outside, raced
in the five path on the turn, dug in for a strong finish and was gaining on the top two. STRYDA took over and moved to the inside to rate the early pace,
came under pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the lead at the rail midway on the turn then flattened the final sixteenth. ALPINE MOON gave
chase outside, raced in the six path on the turn, dug in widest leaving the turn and finished evenly. CEDAR'S WISH gave chase but flattened in the five path
on the turn. COACH RUBE gave chase while saving ground. FULL MOON LOVER gave chase but flattened on the turn. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE chased
inside then weakened while losing ground on the turn. CRAFTY WINDSOR CAT engaged in close early chase but weakened at the rail on the turn.

at the rail entering the stretch but dug in determinedly leaving the turn and just lasted. TIZAWINNER settled in the five path the first turn, bid leaving the five
sixteenths pole and improved steadily in the four path on the far turn, came inside the top two in late stretch and just missed while getting up for second.
SENSUAL CHOCOLATE raced with the pace inside, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage through the far turn,
drew to even terms nearing the eighth pole but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. DOWSING ROD raced in the six path the first turn, left the
turn outside and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the six path then flattened in the lane. SUPER BUSTER
rounded the first turn about the five path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn then flattened in the lane.

off the rail and showed little in the lane. BRAVE SAND RIDER saved ground. HERCULES N LOVE raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase leaving
the half mile pole then weakened in the five path on the far turn. SILVER REDESDALE rounded the opening turn about the three path, gave chase past the
