Footnotes
ARTHUR'S RIDE went to the front, showed the way while inside to the two path, dictated terms going around the far turn, responded well when asked at the
quarter-pole, drew off into upper stretch, was given one light tap of a right-handed crop just before the furlong marker, widened under urging to near the
sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. PERFORM bumped with a rival at the start, moved in nearing the first turn, was reserved on the
inside, saved ground under urging on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and safely secured the place. DUKE OF GLOUCESTER saved
ground on the first turn, was rated towards the front, stalked three wide on the far turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths pole, pursued the winner into
upper stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. DONEGAL FOREVER was fractious in the gate, stumbled at the start and bumped
with a foe, went five wide on the first turn, settled well back in the field, was urged three wide on the far turn, came out into the stretch and failed to threaten.
LEADING CONTENDER went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into
the stretch and failed to respond. COSTA TERRA was hustled from the gate, went four wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside, passed
the half-mile pole under urging, went four wide on the far turn and tired. ROCCO STRONG went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace, came up
empty in the three path on the far turn and capitulated. KEROUAC bumped with a rival at the start, was caught six wide early on the first turn, dropped to the
four then three path later on that bend, lagged at the rear, fell well behind on the far turn and was pulled up then walked off. TAPIT SHOES stumbled badly
at the start and unseated the rider then was walked off after being apprehended by an outrider.

VICTORS VALIANT two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command at
the three-sixteenths, edged clear under a drive, then dug in and held on from a fast closing rival. YO DADDY grew rank early on under restraint past the
stands the initial time and at times off the heels of rivals, chased two to three wide patiently handled until set down spinning three to four wide into upper
stretch, closed well through to the finish but was ultimately staved off to the wire. LORD FLINTSHIRE got bumped at the start by MO REWARDS due to
pressure from SKELLIG ISLAND, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and ran on to
secure the show honors. SKELLIG ISLAND broke in at the start bouncing MO REWARDS off of LORD FLINTSHIRE, chased along the inside from just off
the pace, got let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. ADDICTED TO YOU tracked the pace along the inside and then
just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. MR. MENDELSSOHN saved
ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered no response. AMERICAN
GRANT took the overland route three wide through the first turn and then five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the far
turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six to seven wide for home and offered no rally. MY FRIEND LOUIE got bumped at the start by BIG
NIGHT OUT, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch,
weakened in the late stages. ROAD SODA two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing along the inside at he three-eighths, swung three wide into
upper stretch and offered no kick. SINFUL DANCER established the front after the start and spurted away just off the inside through the first turn, showed
the way in hand along the inside and had the field take closer order into the far turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths in response, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, got collared at the three-sixteenths and weakened. MO REWARDS got bounced around between foes at the start due to
pressure from mostly SKELLIG ISLAND, chased just off the inside through the first turn and then four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three
wide through the far turn, went five wide into upper stretch and came up empty. BIG NIGHT OUT broke out a step at the start bumping MY FRIEND LOUIE,
chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, tipped three wide at the head of the stretch, weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
NOTAH was hustled from the gate, showed speed then set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, shook clear near the
five-sixteenths pole, responded well to the challenge of the runner-up while set down in upper stretch, disposed of that foe inside the furlong marker and
drew clear under steady handling. OWN THE FIELD was fractious in the gate, showed speed then chased the pace while dropping back, went three wide on
the turn, made a four wide bid into upper stretch, fought outside of the winner into the final furlong then was turned away and proved no match while clear
for the place. KANT BEAT THE ROCK moved out while urged along, went four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired while able to get
the show. LUCENCY was urged along off the pace, moved in late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, came four to five wide into upper stretch
and lacked the needed response. LEFTEMBEHIND broke a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the
stretch and failed to rally. DEBATE was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, swung seven wide over heels into upper stretch and was no
factor. PROVEN HOPE was fractious in the gate then hustled from the start, raced towards the rear under urging, saved ground on the turn, was taken in
hand while off heels into upper stretch and failed to threaten. MUSICAL MAESTRO moved in while showing speed, pressed the pace on the outside then in
the two path on the turn, dropped back late on that bend and tired. G MUNNING was restless in the gate then hustled from the start, steadied briefly leaving
the chute then moved out, dropped back fast while in hand near the seven-sixteenths pole, went five then four wide on the turn and faltered then was
transported off the track in the horse ambulance.

BOAT'S A ROCKIN hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from LARK'S MISCHIEF to the outside through swift
splits, remained patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in holding well
to the finish to repel a challenger on the wire. RUN CURTIS RUN hustled from the start, crossed to the inside forcing BRING ME A CHECK to check off his
heels and then CLEAR THE AIR to do the same just afterwards, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route
into upper stretch, tipped out straightened away to the two path and rallied to latch on the leader through the final sixteenth but missed at the end.
MISCHIEVOUS ANGEL chased just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick. SENBEI chased four then three wide coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch,
offered up a mild bid. SCRIPT coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide for home and
offered up a mild bid. BRING ME A CHECK coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside, got forced to check off the heels of RUN CURTIS RUN when
that foe crossed directly in front at the nine-sixteenths and lost about three lengths of ground, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home, dug in under a drive and was brushed by LARK'S MISCHIEF nearing the sixteenth marker and in turn
forced CLEAR THE AIR to check in tight inside at that station and offered no response. CITY MISCHIEF got away to an awkward start and was away last,
chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. LARK'S MISCHIEF hustled from the gate,
pressed the pace from the two path under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, drifted in when weakening
in the late stages and brushed with BRING ME A CHECK forcing that foe into the lane of CLEAR THE AIR at the sixteenth marker before being lightly
pinched out late between foes himself while backing away. KING ANGELO chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide
into upper stretch and offered no response. CLEAR THE AIR coaxed from the gate, got checked along the inside when RUN CURTIS RUN crossed directly
in front at the nine-sixteenths and conceded two to three lengths of ground, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the
inside route into upper stretch, was down along the rail when forced to check near the sixteenth pole when LARK'S MISCHIEF drifted in weakening and
brushed and lightly bumped BRING ME A CHECK at that station and couldn't recover to the finish. FLUID SITUATION hustled from the start, chased three
wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened.

Footnotes
ARMY OFFICER went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, stalked two then three wide on the far turn, was asked four wide into the stretch,
took the lead near the three-sixteenths pole, inched clear into the final furlong, drifted in outside the sixteenth-pole and held under steady urging. SPIRIT
PRINCE went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was asked while inside to the two path on the far turn, chased the winner in the
stretch and willingly earned the place. TIME SONG pulled some under restraint early, saved ground on the first turn, settled more kindly on the backstretch,
rounded most of the far turn in the two path then shifted four wide, chased into the final furlong, drifted in late and showed good courage to get the show.
HUNT BALL was reserved off the inside, waited behind horses in upper stretch, was roused outside the furlong marker then moved out some and also
finished willingly but just missed the show. TIFAREEH was reserved while two to three wide, turned into upper stretch under urging, raced in hand in traffic
near the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. VINSANITY was fractious in the gate, went two to three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the
outside, was given his cue on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and tired. SANDERSON tucked in early, went three wide on the first turn, settled
off the pace, was roused while three wide for most of the far turn then moved to five wide and lacked the needed response. ALEAH ALEAH went to the
front, showed the way on the inside with company to his outside, came under urging on the far turn, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and
gave way. PIRATE broke through the front of the gate prior to the start but remained in the stall, went around the first turn in the two path, settled in the
second flight, chased inside on the far turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and came up empty. STOLEN MAGIC was reserved on
the inside, came under encouragement on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and was no factor. INDIANQUEST went four wide on the first turn, settled
on the outside, was roused three wide on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. MARCEAU moved in early, saved ground on the first
turn, settled off the rail on the backstretch, went around the far turn in the two path and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MUNNYS GOLD established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand just off the inside through swift splits, got set down spinning three to four
wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to inside the eighth pole and held well to the finish. ROSWELL chased along the inside coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. SAM'S TREASURE chased three then two wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. KEHOE BEACH stumbled badly pecking the ground and
then got bumped solidly by the veering in SUGAR HI, had the rider check his left right iron shortly after and conceded about two lengths to the front, pulled
on the bit and rushed up along the inside to be in close aim of the leader, tipped to the two path at the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the stretch. ZIAERATI chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. VERY PRACTICAL got away to a hesitant start striking the
near side of the stall at the start and conceded four lengths to the front, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking two wide
through the turn, got placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. COOLCALM COLLECTED
forwardly placed four wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded and swung six wide
into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish. SUGAR HI veered in at the start bumping KEHOE BEACH solidly just as that rival recovered from a bad
stumble, chased just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, tired, and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
JEFFERSON STREET was bumped lightly just after the start, raced on the outside while coaxed along, moved in leaving the backstretch, went around most
of the turn in the two path, shifted four wide outside the quarter-pole, rallied to the lead in upper stretch, kicked clear under the crop into the final furlong and
powered away under steady urging. KUNSHAN BRIDGE was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out inside the furlong marker and
improved for the place. MARIACHI showed speed then moved out behind the leader and tracked the pace, chased in the three path on the turn, made a bid
into upper stretch, lost touch with the winner into the final furlong and proved no match then lost the place while able to get the show. EL CAPI broke out
and bumped with a foe, sped clear then showed the way through quick fractions, vied inside on the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch and tired.
CONTRARY THINKING was ridden along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. ELIMINATE broke out and hit the gate and was off
slow, spotted the front several lengths, angled in at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, angled out in the final furlong and was no factor.
RADIO RED moved out while urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the five path and failed to respond. ONE GIANT LEAP was fractious in
the warm-up and unseated the rider, bumped with foes just after the start, was urged along near the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came five
wide into the stretch and faltered.
