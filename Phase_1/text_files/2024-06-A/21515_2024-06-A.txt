VALUE MAX settled at the back of a compact field while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid from just off the rail
entering the final turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. FORT LANGLEY broke sharply and raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, repelled a challenge by PADDY 'ORO leaving the turn, and held that rival
safely at bay late. PADDY D'ORO away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail into the backstretch, rallied
smartly two wide entering the final turn and loomed a threat midway through the turn, was unable to match strides with the pacesetter leaving the turn, but
finished willingly two wide in the drive to hold the place. YOU DON'T OWN ME settled off the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch,
advanced three wide midway down the backstretch and continued four wide into the final turn, but faded in the stretch drive. EYE BE SEEING YOU away
alertly and stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backside, rallied three wide from between rivals entering the final turn, but
needed more late.

BECKETT'S BEST away alertly and tracked the pacesetter from just off the rail entering the backstretch, eased off the rail to launch his bid two wide
entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to prove best. DON W away well and stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed with late interest three wide in deep stretch to get up for the place in the final
strides. ASKMENOQUESTIONS broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the
backstretch, maintained his advantage from along the rail entering the final turn, but was outfinished in the late stages while holding on for a share.
CRYPTO MUNNY unhurried early and trailed the field into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and
closed with late interest from along the rail in the drive, while lacking room in the closing strides. ROLLIE'S SPIRIT settled off the early pace while racing
one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called

lane to prove best. BARNEY GOOGLE settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to save
ground through the second turn, advanced midway down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the

first time to engage the pacesetter, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace

WE B THREE rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside, opened a clear advantage
through the final turn, and continued to widen her advantage late while under confident handling. MISS UNION away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into
the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished gamely one out from the rail in the drive to prove
second best. VIVA LA VINO stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, launched her bid from along the rail entering the final
turn, steadied from along the rail in the lane, and finished three wide in deep stretch to garner a share. INFINITE PATIENCE away well and stalked the early
pace while racing three wide from the back of a compact field entering the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished two wide in
the drive while unable to muster a serious late bid. ABOVE AVERAGE broke sharply and stalked the early pace while racing two wide entering the
backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.

Footnotes
SETTECENTO settled off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, advanced into a stalking trip from along the rail
midway down the backside, rallied smartly from along the inside through the final turn, shifted off the rail for the drive, was bumped by SUNBIRD soon after
straightening for home, and closed determinedly three wide while drifting in late to get up in time. BAKKEN OVERDRIVE rushed up from along the rail to vie
for the early lead entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside from the inside of STORMY BLUE, held the narrowest of
advantages into the lane, and just failed to last. STORMY BLUE away alertly and dueled for the lead two wide entering the backstretch, continued to force
the issue from the outside of BAKKEN OVERDRIVE in the run down the backside and into the final turn, continued to battle for the lead into the stretch, and
gave way grudgingly late while steadying between rivals approaching the wire. SUNBIRD settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, pulled his way into a stalking trip in the run to the final turn, checked off the heels of SPACE approaching the turn, rallied from
along the inside before shifting off the rail entering he lane and bumping with SETTECENTO, and finished evenly four wide in the drive. AT ATTENTION
unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the backstretch, launched his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished full of run in the
drive. SPACE broke sharply and stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but
was outfinished late while racing five wide in the drive. BIG UNION away well and settled off the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch,
rallied four wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. REGAL RIOT settled well off the early pace while racing two
wide entering the backstretch, raced three wide into the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. SOARINGFORTHESUN was unprepared at the
start, and reared at the break while still in the hands of the assistant starter, settled 3w lacked response. Following the running of this race the stewards
conducted an inquiry into the start of the race, in particular to SOARINGFORTHESUN. After review the stewards deemed that this horse did not receive a
fair start, and ordered a full refund declaring SOARINGFORTHESUN a NON STARTER.

Footnotes
VALUABLE COWBOY stalked the leaders two wide into the backstretch, collared the leader two wide upon entering the final turn and quickly took control
and was never seriously threatened late. MORETHANSOULTITLE vied for the lead from the inside of LEFT THE BAR entering the first turn, set a pressured
pace from along the rail in the run down the backside, took a narrow advantage into the final turn, but was quickly tackled by VALUABLE COWBOY, was no
match for that rival late, but battled willingly from along the rail in the drive to hold the place. RING OF KERRY away well and stalked the dueling leaders
into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly for wide in the drive to be
along for a share. JUVEE TOO settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished with late
interest five wide in the drive. LEFT THE BAR broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of MORETHANSOULTITLE entering the first turn,
struggled to keep tabs on that rival nearing the final turn, was pushed in on the heels of his pace rival entering the turn and forced to steady, and failed to
regain his momentum. DEALERS HAND away alertly and was allowed to settle well off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the
backstretch, was always well back and failed to make a serious impact. ANOTHER GUINNESS stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the
run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was
both a stewards inquiry, as well as a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of LEFT THE BAR lodged a claim of foul against the rider of VALUABLE COWBOY, for
alleged interference approaching the final turn. After review the claim of foul was upheld, and VALUABLE COWBOY was disqualified from first and placed
fifth.
