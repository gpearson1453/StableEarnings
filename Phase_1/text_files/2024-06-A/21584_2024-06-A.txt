inside and failed to menace. HALOHALLELUJAHGIRL stalked the pace in the four path, bid in the six path at the quarter pole and faltered. TINY EXPRESS

Footnotes
MY BARILEY pressed the pace inside, bid at the quarter pole, took command and drew off under mild handling. OFF THE MEDS took back early, stalked
the pace between foes, checked at the five-sixteenths pole and bid late inside. KNIGHT'S CROSS stalked the pace in the three path and lacked a late bid.
CONTACT TRACING was clear early from between foes, then gave way in the stretch. ROTARY DIAL stalked the pace between foes and gave way in the
stretch. PADDY'S HOUSE took back early and was not a factor. LUCK OF THE DRAW stalked the pace between rivals, bid at the half-mile pole, clipped
heels and fell and left the track under his own power.

SPOTTY SHOWERS stalked the pace inside, angled three wide at the quarter pole, rallied and geared down late. AMAZINGNESS was unrushed inside,
angled three wide at the quarter pole, bid but was no threat. REVS RUN was clear but couldn't last. D' KITTEN and BARB'S VORTEX saved ground to no
avail. JUICY JUSTICE and C F V TU BRUTUS and TOO CROWDED were not factors.

LIL GIN N CLASS led inside and drew off under mild urging. NONEOFYOURBUSINESS was off awkwardly, raced inside, bid at the quarter pole and proved
second best. SI CERTO stalked the pace in the three path and faded. JUST HANGIN ON raced in the four path and lacked a late bid. THREE COATS
improved position late. FIRING FAST stalked the early pace in the three path and faded. OUTLAW WOMAN was through early. CHARGED LEGACY
pressed the early pace between rivals and gave way on the turn.
