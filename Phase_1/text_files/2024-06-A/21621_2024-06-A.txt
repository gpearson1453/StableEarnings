Footnotes
DEFIANT MALICE was off a step slow at the start and raced off the clear top pair, picked up the pace past the half mile marker, quickly moved up to take
over the lead at the quarter pole, came three wide into upper stretch and pulled away while ridden out. YOUNG JONESBORO lacked early speed and raced
in the back, came under a ride around the turn, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and cleared second best. CHEROKEE WILL dueled inside of
SUIT ME UP CHARLIE soon after the start while racing clear over the next two pursuers, continued to match strides into the turn, got overtaken when the
eventual winner swept by approaching the quarter pole and steadily weakened. SUIT ME UP CHARLIE broke on top and vied outside of CHEROKEE WILL
for the early lead, battled on into the turn, was no match when the winner took over near the quarter pole and tired in the drive.

GETAWAY DAY pressed the top pair up the backstretch, dueled three deep around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, roused for more, responded
willingly, tapped once in the final furlong and drew off. BREATHTAKING FOLLY was off a bit slow at the start, raced off the early pace then moved into
contention late on the backstretch, loomed boldly four wide at the quarter pole, was no match for the leader at the head of the lane but ran and secured
place. KANTIRUN vied outside of LADY RAZORBACK with GETAWAY DAY applying pressure just to the outside, vied between rivals around the turn, ran
on into stretch run and prevailed for a share. LADY RAZORBACK vied inside of KANTIRUN up the backstretch, dueled inside of rivals around the turn, ran
on into upper stretch then flattened out. HOT SHOT SHOPPER chased the top flight up the backstretch, swung three wide into upper stretch and lacked a
needed rally. MS BUMBLEBEE raced in the back and steadily retreated.

LETS ROCK N STROLL raced under pressure in opening stages then shook free and set the pace, held firm around the turn, came two to three wide into
upper stretch, roused for more, responded and kept clear. PAPA GEEB was forwardly placed along the outside, chased in close contention around the turn,
sustained a steady three to four wide bid for the eventual winner and finished clearly second best. BILLY WHO pressed the pace soon after the start then
chased the pace up the backstretch, was ridden along the rail around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and finished well clear over the rest. GLOME
raced off the early pace, swung five wide into upper stretch and improved position without threatening. SPIRITED DREAM veered in and came away slow at
the start, lacked speed and raced in or near the back, came three wide into the lane, shifted to the rail and failed to make an impact. D'S MIC DROP was not
too far back early on, failed to advance under pressure around the turn and never threatened. SING FOR UR SUPPER raced near midpack in early stages,
flattened around the turn and had no late response.

Footnotes
C L LEGACY vied outside of CAN'T MAKE ME for the lead up the backstretch, edged back briefly upon entering the turn, launched a two wide rebid at the
quarter pole, took over the lead turning for home, cleared command in upper stretch and finished going away. AMERICAN SUE settled through early stages,
given cue near the quarter pole, came three paths wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and gained second best. NAUTICAL MISS was forwardly
placed along the rail, got in tight and steadied leaving the backstretch, continued in close range then flattened past the mid-way point around the turn, came
two wide into upper stretch, continued to put in an effort and regained show. CAN'T MAKE ME vied inside of CL LEGACY in the opening quarter, then held
the lead entering the turn, took on the re-bid from aforementioned foe at the quarter pole, got collared turning for home, ran on then flattened late. FARRAH
FOWLER raced off the early pace, swung five wide into upper stretch and lacked a rally. PRAIRIE FIREBALL saved ground and failed to move into
contention, vanned off after the race. OLIVIA'S HOPE chased the clear top trio in the opening quarter, failed to advance under pressure around the turn
then gave way.

Footnotes
SHOTSHELL vied inside of COST BASIS entering the first turn, continued to match strides into the backstretch and took on the added challenge of
CHAPEL BARN, shook free mid-way around the far turn still racing in hand, cut the corner and given cue entering upper stretch, responded willingly and
pulled away. INCA EMPIRE raced off the early pace, picked up the tempo around the far turn, swung four paths wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady
and cleared second best. CASEYS MEMORY rated off the early pace, was ridden along for response entering the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane
and stayed on for a share. COST BASIS came away in good order, cleared and crossed over to match strides two wide entering the first turn, dueled
outside of eventual winner up the backstretch, could not move on move on with rival mid-way around the far turn, ran on into upper stretch then gave way.
CHAPEL BARN stalked the top pair in early stages, moved up three wide to engage rivals for the lead mid-way up the backstretch, dueled three deep then
failed to be a match past the three eighths pole and steadily weakened. ALLO ENRY raced off the top trio along the inside into the backstretch, weakened
three furlongs from home and continued to tire in the drive.

MIDNIGHT RULES was away in good order and stalked the clear leader around the first turn, picked up the pace mid-way up the backstretch, closed on the
pacesetter racing in tandem with MAHOMES entering the far turn, held a slim lead then opened up past upper stretch, tapped twice, responded willingly,
pulled away and finished ridden out. BIG PINES SANDY secured inside position around the first turn and rated off the clear leader, picked up the pace
entering the far turn, came three wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and captured place. MAHOMES was the closest pursuer of the clear leader
around the first turn, picked up the tempo mid-way up the backstretch, closed in on rival racing in tandem with MIDNIGHT RULES entering the far turn, vied
with eventual winner then flattened in the final furlong and just lasted for show. WARRIOR'S RUN was allowed to settle off the early pace, made a move late
on the far turn, hustled along four wide into upper stretch, sustained a steady bid and just missed out on show. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY raced in the back,
swung wide into the lane and passed a couple tiring foes. WELLER ROGUE raced off the early pace, hustled along five wide into upper stretch and had no
late response. LAWLESS JOHN hustled up to the lead in opening strides, widened to clear command around the first turn, continued with a wide advantage
mid-way up the backstretch, got collared entering the final turn and retreated.
