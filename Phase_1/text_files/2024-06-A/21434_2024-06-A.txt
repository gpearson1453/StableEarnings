Footnotes
MAZAL EIGHTEEN controlled the pace, widened in the stretch then was geared down late while never seriously threatened. SENSE A MILLION chased
between rivals, went after the winner on the turn and lasted for the place. SHE'S GOT GAME saved ground in striking range then flattened out in the stretch.
ANNA ROCKS dropped back three wide and lacked a rally. STARSHIP ROGUE broke slowest and trailed briefly then was never a factor. MADAME
ROUGE prompted the pace in the opening quarter then gave way racing wide.

IMAGINE THIS trailed far behind, began advancing on the final turn then surged clear in the final sixteenth. WHISKEY PRIZE controlled the pace, lost the
lead briefly at the quarter pole, moved clear again but was nailed nearing the wire. STAVROS angled out with a strong bid on the final turn, earned a brief
lead then hung in the stretch. MAJOR CAM forced pace outside for five furlongs and gave way. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT lacked speed inside and was
never in contention. FOOD FOODIE moved close up outside for half a mile and stopped.

CLASSY MISS settled behind the loose leader, bid in the final furlong to the front and held multiple rivals safe. JUST STAY HOME saved ground close up,
moved with the winner then was outfinished. BEYOND A MILLION lacked speed, advanced inside in the stretch with some late energy. PRINCESS SOPHIE
moved clear in the opening quarter, drifted out in the stretch and weakened in the final eighth. CANOODLE trailed early inside and was never a factor.

LIPLOCK settled off the pace, swung wide into the stretch with some late energy. SIRENETTA trailed far behind and was never in contention. A BIT BAD N
BOUJEE was urged off the pace three wide and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
MELODIA far back early, rallied inside and surged late to get up in time. COLLIN'S GREY LADY broke alertly and moved clear inside then weakened late
and was nailed nearing the wire. WISHING ONA PRAYER urged close up inside, angled out in the stretch and continued gamely. AWESOME PAL
prompted the pace outside, raced close up to the stretch and flattened. OUI MADAME trailed for half a mile then passed fading rivals.
TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE moved close up briefly then gave way readily. PHANCY PHILLY lacked speed and faded steadily trailing through the stretch.

Footnotes
DANCE A DINI raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, took over into the stretch and drew away under steady urging. MOTSKARI lacked speed, moved
strongly between rivals on the final turn but was no match for the winner. I FEELUCKY TONITE saved ground off the pace, angled out in the stretch and
flattened. RUSH CENTER moved close up outside in the opening half mile then faltered. IT'S A PITY hustled to a wide advantage before half mile then
came up empty in the stretch. ROAD CALL trailed far behind and was never a factor. CALL ME NOW weakened steadily losing contact with his field.
