Footnotes
LUCKY SHORE secured perfect position while saving ground, angled three wide into the stretch to rally along in time. MOONSHINE DREAMER drifted over
early on to press pace, stayed on game to the late stretch but outgamed to the wire. SPRING SPINNING rated back from the gate inside, saved ground
running on in the late going to the wire. CARIBBEAN NIGHT slow into stride, secured good position between horses and went on evenly while drifting out in
the stretch rn. SEAU N'TAP good inside speed to the front, dueled to far turn while empty in the stretch run. TRICK HAT never menaced throughout.
CELESTIAL SPIN had a terrible beginning with no chance thereafter.

HARVEY'S PRINCESS tracking leaders to far turn, ran on off rail stretch, ridden out. WOODS HOLE speed to the front, stayed on to far turn but outkicked
to the wire while no match for the winner and held the place spot. SONHO DE VERAO good position to far turn, split foes and kept on game for show spot.
SING SCAT raced a wide trip throughout with a bid in stretch while outkicked in the late going. AUNT RUTH no speed to far turn, ran on while no threat in
the stretch run. I LIKEM chased leader to the half, stayed game to quarter pole while on empty in the final furlong. Q BOND inside trip to far turn, ran up
inside and had to be checked back hard with no room and lost all chance from that point. UNWHIRLED failed to menace throughout.
