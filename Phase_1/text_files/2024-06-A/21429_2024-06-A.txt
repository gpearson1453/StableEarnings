Footnotes
EMPTY GESTURE pressed the pace outside in the beginning, poked her head in front five sixteenths from the wire, battled outside with a pesky foe in
upper stretch, began to edge away from that challenger by the sixteenth pole and just held on at the finish from the closing rivals. DADDY'S DAISY broke
out at the start, had a nice set up tracking the contesting pair on the rail, angled out in the three path at the quarter pole, had her sights set on the front two
straightening out for home and was closing in late but just missed at the wire. RING IT UP stalked inside near the rear, crept closer on the turn running on
the rail, to be in the hunt on the fence turning for home, angled outside off the leaders with a furlong to go and ran on determinedly but was on the losing
end of a three way photo for the win. LADY WITH ATTITUDE was bumped on the start to trail in the early going, began to pick up foes inside midturn,
shifted out three wide at the quarter pole making a sharp move, had clear running room outside in the five path for the drive and was gaining late.
TATOOSONMYSOUL seized the lead at the start, maintained a slim advantage while prompted outside down the backstretch, surrendered the top spot
midway on the turn travelling on the rail, stubbornly battled in the stretch, could not find more late and faded in the final seventy yards. TACHYON SPEED
was pushed out on the break, stalked between foes near the back of the pack and made little impression when asked through the turn. KATZ ME OF
COURSE stalked three deep on the outside, having only the poor starter beat down the back straight, was roused in mid-turn and passed tired runners at
the top of the stretch. QUEEN SAHARA tracked the engaged pair outside in the backstretch, was under a drive but could not keep up with the leading group
throughout the turn and gave way at the furlong pole. STANDING STRONG was in the second flight three deep outside the challengers, had no run when
asked at the three furlong marker and backed through the field in the turn.

Footnotes
KAWACATOOSE forced the pace inside to begin, took over the top spot with seven sixteenths from home, fought on gamely on the fence through the turn,
continued to be unyielding on the rail down the stretch and held off the rival at the wire. HIPNOTIZADA took the lead from the onset, was relegated to a
chasing role outside throughout the turn, battled tenaciously outside to the wire by could not get by the stubborn winner at the finish. GHOUL (BRZ) settled
on the fence in midfield down the backside, began to edge closer on the rail through the turn, shifted out from behind the dueling leaders with a sixteenth to
run, was gaining late but finished up to be a clear but non threatening third. CHUNKY MONKEY was off just a touch slow on the break inside to be close to
the back down the back straight, improved on the fence around the bend, rallied between horses in the three path with an eighth remaining and got up for a
minor share in the end. TRICKY MAGICIAN ran between foes near the rear in the backstretch, closed the gap mildly three wide throughout the turn, shifted
out to be in the five path straightening out for the drive and finished up willingly to the line. GRAND ALLIANCE was unhurried to trail outside of horses,
continued to see the field running around the bend, angled inwards to the rail with a furlong to go and showed some late interest up the fence in deep
stretch. LOADED VIXEN watched the front two down the backside, could not match strides with the rivals on both sides who were making a move through
the turn and yielded by the furlong pole. LION OF THE SEA travelled outside horses in mid-pack down the backstretch, made a brief run three wide at the
three eighths marker until the four path at the top of the lane, could not keep going and wilted in the final furlong. MISS BOBBIT stalked near the rear three
deep on the outside, could not get involved running on the oval and had little to offer in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ARRIVISTE hesitated at the start to trail on the fence in the early stages, was unhurried seeing the field while still quite in touch along the backside, was
nudged on midway through the far turn to start going, got a couple of left handed taps to really get into gear turning for home and was gritty on the fence to
surge in deep stretch for the score. FLAWLESS RULER was tucked in, settling behind the front trio, waiting to move down the backstretch, roused with
three furlongs from the prize, smartly closed in up the rail, shifted out to the three path for the drive to the wire, briefly had the lead for a moment at the
sixteenth pole but could not outkick the winner in deep stretch. GENDRAGON was in front on the fence in the early going, co-led on the inside down the
backstretch, put away the early speed foes by the three furlong marker, opened up through the turn, was clinging onto the lead with a furlong to go but was
engulfed on both sides at the sixteenth pole and held to be a clear third at the finish line. SIR SAMUEL ran four deep widest of runners on the first turn,
settled outside three wide under a tight rein down the backstretch just off the leaders, was scrubbed on for more with three furlongs to go, could not keep up
and was one paced in the lane to settle on the fringes in the end. PRINCE OF AYRSHIRE tracked outside into the first bend, bobbed heads for the lead
outside down the backstretch, had nothing left to give three furlongs from the finish, shifted four wide at the top of the lane and weakened to the line.
ENCHANT ME travelled in the three path with horses on either side going into the first turn, stalked in the third flight outside down the back straight, made
little impact going around the bend and had little finish to offer three wide in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
THIS DUDE A BREEZE was coaxed clear of foes in a scramble for the early lead to take charge and dictate terms up the backstretch racing near the rail,
was challenged three furlongs out, dispatched that rival and kicked clear in upper stretch then held safe. BASKETBALL JONES was forwardly-positioned
tracking inside just off the leader to the turn, came out three wide in upper stretch, was no match but second best. SECRET STORM settled into stride,
advanced outside foes near the half shifting in a bit entering the turn, put a head in front of the leader outside the three-eighths, could not kick on and
weakened in the stretch. RYE'S MY GUY shifted in early, raced just off the rail ni the two to three path off the pace, advanced inside between foes leaving
the turn, carried on evenly. BAR TALK angled in early, saved ground on the turn, was one-paced. DREAM ON BABY was up close chasing four to five wide,
lacked the needed late kick. CANTUCCI stalked early, dropped back heading to and on the turn racing four deep, came out six wide in the stretch, needed
more. HARPER CITY stalked within range of the early pace from between runners, weakened. NEEDS FULFILLED was well back and showed little.

Footnotes
SCAT FACTOR was situated near the back five deep of horses, improved four wide around foes with three eighths to go, circled rivals through the turn to
bid five wide at the top of the stretch and while not switching leads fought on the edge away for the victory nearing the wire. JACK tracked four wide in the
second flight outside foes under a snug hold, moved to the lead while in hand by the quarter pole, dueled with the winner outside of him in the stretch and
gave way late to be second best with that solid effort. GOOD POINT travelled in mid-division on the rail down the backside, had nowhere to go stuck behind
a wall of runners on the turn, weaved through traffic at the quarter pole three wide, shifted in to the rail for the finish and was flying late, full of run in the end.
FIGHTING IRISH settled on the fence in the back flight after the start, picked up the bit smartly in mid-turn, shifted outside at the quarter pole to loom a
menace in the six path straightening out for home but stalled in the last sixteenth of a mile. RED IN FRONT had the rail position watching the trio up front at
the half, waited to move behind the lead threesome throughout the turn, had a seam in the two path in upper stretch but had no kick when clear in the final
furlong. TODAY settled in the second flight between foes under a tight hold down the backstretch, closed in on the front pack at the quarter pole, was in tight
surroundings, had to be throttled down for a bit, could not pose a threat and finished up mildly in lane four down the stretch. HEY LUIGI had the advantage
down the back straight, set the pace around the oval while hounded outside by runners, was collared outside by the quarter pole, dueled on the fence until
the furlong marker and tired in the late stages. EAT FOOD EVERYDAY trailed on the backstretch, continued to see the pack traveling around the bend,
swung out to be seven wide at the top of the lane and passed weary ones in the stretch. HALCON NEGRO had one rival beaten down the backside, was
asked to go on in mid-turn, had no acceleration, was floated out to the eight path turning for home and could not be a factor to the wire. FRAC CITY
prompted the pace three wide outside in the early going, battled up top three wide on the bend, was hard ridden trying to stay in the mix by the quarter pole,
had little to give for the drive and flattened out through the lane. THIS KATZ FOR REAL forced the pace in the two path with horses on either side down the
backstretch, continued to fight up front in the turn, could not maintain position at the quarter pole, was steadied soon after, trailed at the top of the stretch
and could not recover.

Footnotes
LUCKY ROMANCE sped clear early, set the pace near but off the fence facing some outside pressure into the turn, shook clear of foes and held well.
MYRA'S BOY tracked from inside, came out just a bit for the drive, was no match for the winner but secured the place. THOR'S CAUSE shifted in early,
saved some ground near the rail early on the turn, angled four to five wide coming out of that bend and under urging, showed mild late foot. ITS TIME TO
SHINE switched outside the eventual winner early, stalked that one up close three wide into and on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. DUBAWI BULL
was taken back, angled in and unhurriedly brought up the rear early, advanced inside foes leaving the turn, angled five wide at the top of the stretch, ran on
with mild late interest. THEFRONTIERSMAN advanced outside foes early to get within range four then three wide on the turn, dropped back and shifted in,
ran on evenly in the stretch. BUCK'S FIZZ was outside foes at the back into the turn four to five wide, bumped with a rival at the top of the stretch, was
never near enough to threaten. BEARING DOWN chased from off the pace between runners, exchanged bumps inside and out at the top of the stretch,
failed to rally. CATHOLIC JACKIE shifted in and raced mid-pack up the backstretch, steadily dropped back on the turn, was carried out and bumped with a
rival at the top of the stretch, failed to rally.

Footnotes
WICKED DJANGO was unhurried to settle near the back outside in the first turn, rated kindly loping along three deep outside horses down the backside,
started to go around runners three wide, three furlongs out, pounced on a much softened up pacesetter in upper stretch and went on by for the score in the
last furlong. WAR STRATEGY broke out on the break, had the lead on the fence under a tight hold into the first turn, had company on the outside into the
backstretch, began to edge away from that rival in mid-backstretch, then his hand was forced again by another challenger making an early move to briefly
have the lead inside the half, disposed of that foe midway on the far turn, collared once more, by the winner in upper stretch, by then had little left and still
held for place with that gritty performance. DEADPAN tracked outside in the first turn, put the pressure on the frontrunning leader along the early part of the
backstretch, was then content to track the leader with his new rival pressing the pace at the half, seemed uninterested on the turn being shuffled back to last
and re-surged inside by mid-stretch and closed in to capture third with the late rally. COPPER MISSILE was squeezed at the break to trail on the fence,
continued on the rail at the back along the backside, closed the gap when making a mild move under right-handed encouragement at the quarter pole,
angled out to be in range of the top two four wide turning for home, could not go on and was one paced to the wire for a minor share. SMART ALMASTY
was reined in on the first turn, had a nice set up sitting behind the engaged stablemates down the backstraight, made a premature move bursting between
to co-leaders at the half to poke his head in front momentarily, ran out of gas by the five sixteenths marker and stopped in upper stretch.

Footnotes
GRANDSON unhurriedly brought up the rear saving ground inside, swung eight wide turning for home, took aim while widest of all, drove past seventy yards
from the wire and was eased up the final strides. MAAKWA sped clear, set the pace from off the rail, was challenged leaving the far turn, headed by the top
of the stretch, fought on inside turning back that rival inside the final furlong but was nailed by a different rival after. CLASSIC MO TOWN stalked the loose
leader, advanced three wide on the far turn, bid coming to the top of the stretch taking a narrow lead, was turned away past mid-stretch and settled for show
honors. C MY MEISTER shifted in before the first turn, saved ground racing off the leaders about mid-pack, came out four to five wide in upper stretch, ran
on. JOKESTAR was urged at the start, raced off the inside about mid-pack, was mostly three to four wide on the turns, ridden along three furlongs out,
swung out five wide coming to the quarter pole and a bit further for the drive, needed more. COLLECTIVE FORCE settled at the back three wide in the early
going, swung eight wide turning for home, failed to rally. SOUPER COHIBA stalked the leading pair from inside, moved out four wide and in range coming to
the quarter pole, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
JOURNEYMAN co-trailed on the inside after the start, improved to rate in mid-pack on the fence at the half, waited patiently to move on the far turn inside,
closed in on the fence in upper stretch, gaining momentum, shifted out for running room at the sixteenth pole in the two path and got up in deep stretch for
the score. DUN DRUM tracked three wide between horses in the beginning, settled in midfield on the outside at the half, moved to get better positioning
going into the far turn, closed to gap at the quarter pole to be in the hunt three wide at the top of the lane, fought on stubbornly in deep stretch but was out
gamed nearing the wire. DANCIN IN DA'NILE co-trailed on the outside to begin, was allowed to gather himself seeing the field along the backstretch, started
to rally but was checked mildly on the inside nearing the quarter pole, switched outside to be five wide turning for home and was full of run, gaining with
each stride but could not get there in time. DAY TRIPPER cleared to the lead sitting just off the rail, was unopposed setting the fractions down the backside,
continued up top with no pressure around the final turn, dug in at mid-stretch clinging to the lead and just gave way in the final sixteenth pole to settle on the
fringes in the end. EXPRESSMAN hopped at the start, was eager fighting the riders restraint inside in the early stages, settled down to track on the rail by
the half, angled out to bid just outside in the two path at the top of the stretch, could not go on late and evened out with horses on each side in the last
sixteenth. ONENIGHTSTANDARDS travelled widest in the five path into the first turn, settled only ahead of one rival down the backside, made little
improvement at the three eighths marker and could not get into contention running down the lane. STORMY ENTRY tracked four wide between runners in
the opening turn, continued to watch the leader two wide down the back straight, could not maintain positioning at the half, chased the leader three wide
around the final bend and emptied out by the time they straightened out for the drive.

Footnotes
LEGAL CATCH tracked two wide between foes in the early stages, edge closer three eighths from the prize, moved in to bid for the lead outside at the
quarter pole and drew away with authority in the stretch. BOWMAN'S RUN was brushed inside on the break, stalked between rivals in the third flight in the
early stages, rallied, splitting runners midway on the final turn and closed in to be a distant second, nesting the rest in the end. REBEL FAITH stalked on the
rail in the third flight down the backside, make little progress on the fence five sixteenths from the wire, shifted out to the three path turning for home and
finished up willingly to capture third money in the end. KING ROSSO was brushed outside to begin, nestled on the rail behind the leader in the first turn,
continued to sit behind the pacesetter down the backside, could not go on in the far turn, lost position and re-rallied on the fence for a minor role.
RUNAWAY CHARLIE travelled three wide outside horses, stalking in the third flight on the first turn, offered a mild run three wide midway on the final turn,
angled out to be five wide for the stretch drive and was one paced in the run to the wire. BOURBON NORTH took command from the start, dictated the pace
unchallenged down the back straight, was collared by the winner in upper stretch, raced on the wrong lead to the wire and faltered in the final sixteenth.
MIDNIGHT MO broke outwards on the start, tracked three wide into the first turn, chased the leader three deep down the backstretch, continued to try to
reel in the pacesetter on the final turn but to no avail, drifted out at the quarter pole to be six wide for the stretch run and little show in the stretch. REDNECK
REBEL was pushed out on the break, trailed throughout, angled out four wide for the drive but was never a factor.
