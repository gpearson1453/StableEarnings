Footnotes
FOREIGN TOURIST stalked the pace from three wide through the final turn then moved up to engage the leader at the eighth pole and drove past to clear
late. MARK WITH AN E prompted the pace from the two path then took the lead at the half mile marker and edged away on the turn but was headed at the
eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. SMART IZZY raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then made a four wide bid at the half mile marker
but couldn't catch the top two and flattened out. NO COST was forwardly placed around the first turn then settled in mid pack down the backstretch, moved
between horses at the three furlong marker to make a late run to improve position. SHEZA CAT hesitated at the start and rubbed the gate leaving, trailed
the field to the first turn then moved up from four wide on the backstretch but failed to sustain the bid. MEGANS MILLIONS saved ground throughout but fell
back on the final turn and was never a factor. LEPRECHAUN CHARM was allowed to settle on the inside and had no impact. K J'S PISTOL ANNIE went to
a clear lead around the first turn and was through after a half.

COLT FICTION was hustled away to a pressured lead, inched away on the turn and drew off in the stretch to prove best. D TWO raced near the back on the
backstretch then moved up from three wide on the turn, angled in at the top of the stretch and made a late rail bid to be second best. CAMPISI rushed up to
press the pace from two wide to the top of the stretch and weakened. PROVOST stalked the pace from three wide and lacked the late response needed.
FIFTEEN LOVE BACK chased the leaders from the inside around the turn then moved out to four wide at the eighth pole and passed tired ones. TRAPPE
VALLEY rushed up the rail to be in contention and tired. HAIL STATE was outrun.

IRISH HEATWAVE stalked the pace from three wide down the backstretch then took the command at the three furlong marker, was challenged at the top of
the stretch, dueled to the wire and held on. WARTIME HERO raced in the middle of the pack, made a middle move on the backstretch, moved out to three
wide at the three furlong marker, engaged the leader at the top of the stretch and dueled to the wire but was second best. ANDIAMO GIACOMO prompted
the pace from the inside then fell back on the final turn, made a rebid for the late gain. SHAMAYIM saved ground around the first turn then made a three
wide bid on the final turn and was outkicked. SNIVELING was unhurried down the backstretch then made a mild bid on the final turn to pass tiring rivals.
TWITTY CITY was always back. SENATOR CON rushed to the lead to the final turn and was done.
