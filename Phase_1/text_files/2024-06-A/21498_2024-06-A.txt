Footnotes
MISTER MESEEKS co-trailed on the inside for the first part of the race, shifted out reaching for more ground with five sixteenths left to run, angled out five
wide gathering more momentum at the top of the lane, veered in under right-handed urging at the eighth pole and edged away for the win nearing the wire.
JAY BIRD dueled outside for most of the race, finally shook clear of the pesky other speed rival by the furlong pole but could not find enough to hold off the
winner who was full of run in deep stretch. YORKVILLE stalked near the rear all alone along the backside, moved three wide, trying to keep the eventual
winner in at the quarter pole, was floated out widest to the six path turning for home and closed well to capture third money. MIGHT BEE SPEEDY tracked
the pair contesting up front along the backside, came under a ride closing the gap through the far turn, posed a threat in the four path in upper stretch, was
checked mildly with a furlong to go and finished up to held for a minor role in the end. UMNEYAAT tracked the embattled duo sitting on the rail down the
backside, moved in on the rail by the quarter pole, shifted just outside to the two path for the drive, was in tight quarters at the furlong pole and could not
offer a finish late. MO TOURIST co-trailed on the outside in the early stages, was roused three furlongs to go outside rivals, had little to show going around
the far turn but finished up with interest in the late stages. STORMIN DAVE dueled on the inside in the first turn, was crowded while on the rail entering the
backstretch from the other speed rival, battled on the fence until the furlong marker and faltered on the fence. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #1 STORMIN
DAVE AGAINST #6 JAY BIRD ENTERING THE BACKSTRETCH WAS DISALLOWED. ALSO, RCOF #2 UMNEYAAAT AGAINST #5 MIGHT BE SPEEDY
AT THE EIGHTH POLE RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

ABSOLUTE CHAIRMAN had a good spot nestled on the rail just back of the leader down the backstretch, inched closer going around the oval inside, shifted
three wide at the quarter pole, lost his path with a furlong to go, switched outside for a clear run four wide late and surged to get up just before the finish line
for the score. WETIKO travelled alone in midfield in the early going, tracked three deep on the outside of horses by the half, closed in three wide circling on
the turn, angled out in the five path for the drive, took over control at the sixteenth pole but was nailed by the winner just before the wire. IT'S ME MARIO
tracked behind the contesting pair down the backstretch, chased the dueling leaders with rivals on both sides through the turn, was in the mix up front four
wide at the top of the lane and stayed on well enough to hold for third money. CHEAP SPEED stalked near the back outside of horses in the backstretch,
rallied three wide three furlongs from the prize, continued a good sustained run in the two path straightening out for home and offered a good late run to
settle on the fringes in the end. DIXIE'S FLATTER stalked near the rear, travelling on the rail down the back straight, closed the gap smartly while in hand
on the fence throughout the turn, had nowhere to go inside at the top of the lane, was checked on the rail with an eighth remaining, angled out and had late
energy trying to recover in deep stretch. MOON FLASHER broke outwards on the start, prompted the pace down the backside, turned up the pressure
dueling head to head for the lead three furlongs out, held a brief lead three wide turning for home, could not find more late and wilted on the fence by the
sixteenth pole. MAGIC RUSH seized the front after the start, was headed outside three furlongs from home, battled stubbornly on the fence until the furlong
marker and retreated inside in deep stretch. SILENT PARTY hopped on the break, trailing down the backside, could not get involved running around the
turn and made little presence in the stretch run.

Footnotes
VICTORIA ELIZABETH was content to track the frontrunner down the backstretch, edged clear, to assume command midway on the turn, opened up
turning for home and was kept to the task to hold safe comfortably when crossing the finish line. FLIP FLOPPIN FAST was pinched on the break to trail
early on, moved four deep along the backside to be near the pace outside foes by the half, kept pace with the leaders three wide on the turn, posed the
main threat in the four path straightening out for the wire, was no match for the winner down the lane but won the secondary duel for the place share in deep
stretch. AZIEL tracked three wide between foes at the half, lost some positioning going into the turn, shifted out to be three wide in the hunt with horses on
either side in upper stretch and just missed out on winning the battle for place at the wire. OLIVIA'S MELODY broke inwards on the break, settled near the
back of the pack between foes with four furlongs to run, was scrubbed three eighths from the finish line and finished up with interest running down the lane
for a minor share. SILENT PRINCESS was hustled to take command down the backside, continued to set the fractions into the turn, was headed outside
with five sixteenths to go, offered little resistance in the turn and gave way on the fence at the top of the stretch. SOUL JOURNEY broke outwards to begin,
trailed the compact bunch on the rail at the half, was roused inside three furlongs from home, made no headway inside running around the bend and had
nothing to offer in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
NONNO'S LITTLE BOY unhurriedly brought up the rear, moved out heading up the backstretch, advanced outside the trailing runner then more foes three
to four deep through the far turn, rallied from off the inside but inside a runner late to edge past nearing the wire. ANSELMO settled last but one, moved out
and advanced in a middle-move outside foes four wide floating out five then six wide leaving the far turn and now in contention, took the lead outside the
furlong marker, led till late and was outfinished but clearly second best. JUST START ME UP soon led, set the pace inside, drifted out leaving the far turn,
was overtaken by mid-stretch and had no extra. ALBERTA BE MINE pressed then stalked the leader in the early stages, raced mostly two to three wide,
asked for more past the five-sixteenths, went evenly in the stretch. ROBITAILLE tucked in to track the leading pair inside, saved ground, was one-paced.
SUPER HEADLINE stalked from outside mid-pack, was under a hold midway up the backstretch dropping back to last by the far turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
MANNIX (IRE) was allowed to settle on the rail near the rear in the beginning, was shuffled back a touch to trail the field under a tight hold by the half,
weaved through runners in the two path at the quarter pole, shifted out for a clear lane in the five path at the furlong marker and drew away with authority at
the wire. LUCYS CHILD stalked three deep between foes in a very tight pack by the half, was going the wrong way losing ground on the turn, angled out
four wide outside horses for the drive and closed in smartly to nail second money at the wire with his late surge. SWATH was in mid-pack five deep outside
of rivals down the backside, circled rivals four wide around the turn, loomed in the four path straightening out for the drive, was no match for the much the
best winner late and just lost the place share at the wire in a tight photo. BAYTOWN ELVIS travelled four deep outside horses near the lead down the
backstretch, poked his head in front briefly dueling up front midpoint on the turn, battled up top until the eighth pole, could not go on and faded late for a
minor role in the end. CHANCEL was bumped inside to begin, fought the riders resistant pulling to the lead while headstrong along the backside, was
collared outside with five sixteenths to run, kept on going, clinging onto the lead inside at the furlong pole, had no more to offer late and yielded in the final
sixteenth on the fence. COMMANDER JOE shadowed the lead three deep between rivals down the backside, could not quicken as much as the two other
counterparts up front midway on the turn, stayed on gamely between foes until the sixteenth pole and weakened in deep stretch. SUNSPEAR broke out on
the start, pressed the pace inside early on, was throttled back to track inside, waiting to move through the turn, had no path to travel in upper stretch and
lacked a rally to the wire. DRAGON'S BREW was pushed out to be in tight quarters on the break, trailed in the early going, moved in the two path getting
better position into the turn, was nudged three eighths out travelling in midfield around the bend, made little progress and emptied out at the top of the lane.

SPITE STORE chased from outside, went three to four wide on the turn, came out a bit for the drive, struck the lead past the furlong marker, drove clear and
was eased up in the final strides. TRICKY MAGICIAN shifted in and saved ground on the turn racing mid-pack, came out five wide in upper stretch for room,
secured the place while no threat to the winner. CASANOVA KITTEN tossed the head at the break, was outsprinted early racing outside three to four wide
on the turn, swung out six deep for the stretch run, kicked on mildly. COURAGEOUS COPPER was coaxed forward from the start, pressed and prompted
the pace outside two to three wide dueling on the turn, neeeded more late. TOMCAT BLACK settled at the rear off the inside, came out four wide in upper
stretch, ran on. ALICIA'S KID was urged at the start, set a pressured pace inside, weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
JAMIESTA hit the gate on the break, stalked at the back three deep outside horses along the backside, moved boldly, circling four wide around the turn,
was out widest in the four path turning for home and finished up the strongest down the lane to draw off in the final seventy yards. HIGHLAND SOCIETY
tracked outside in the early stages of the race, assumed the lead outside at the quarter pole, had little left trying to fend off the winner in deep stretch but did
stay on to best the rest at the wire. BLUE MAX rated kindly on the rail in mid-pack, encountered tight surroundings in the two path when the field bunched
up going into the turn, kept pace just off the fence through the turn, loomed a menacing presence between rivals at the top of the lane, could not continue
the run and evened out to be third at the finish line. LENNY K settled near the rear three wide between runners at the half, made a quick move splitting rivals
three wide with five sixteenths from home, was part of the quartet across the track three wide between foes bidding for the lead in upper stretch, could not
find another gear late and stalled by the sixteenth pole for a minor award in the end. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS tracked on the rail down the backside,
travelled inside but could not go with others making a rally three furlongs out, lost ground through the turn and could not play a role in the stretch drive.
BOXER BRIEF was void of early speed, trailing along the backside, could still see the field when roused three furlongs out, made little impression on the
turn and passed the weary early leader who was empty in the stretch. MOBILIZER cleared from the outside to have the lead down the back straight,
continued up front until the quarter pole, had nothing left to give inside at the top of the lane and stopped on the fence at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
WARP RIDE settled on the rail in midfield, closed the gap improving on the fence going around the oval, shifted just off the fence for the drive to the wire,
was full of run in deep stretch and, in a well timed rally, got up right at the finish for the score. ROCK TO FAME was hustled on the rail to have the lead, was
unopposed setting a rapid pace around the turn, opened up at the top of the stretch, began to get leg weary at the furlong marker and was nailed at the wire
by the winner closing late outside. IT'S A FLUKE stalked in the third flight three wide inside a fellow rival in the early stages, rallied three wide between
runners at the quarter pole, shifted just outside four wide turning for home and came away victorious for the show battle at the wire. MUSICAL SPELL
stalked in the third flight four wide outside rivals in the back straight, kept pace with the leaders still travelling four wide around the bend, dueled for the show
award in the five path outside the challenger in the stretch but was out gamed late and had to settle on the fringes in the end. FOREST STAR co-trailed on
the outside at the half mile marker, saved ground on the rail progressing throughout the turn and finished up willingly inside, battling for the minors in the
stretch. MAGIC TOMAHAWK trailed the field from the start, made little headway around the oval and passed only weakened runners driving to the wire.
KINETIC STONE chased between runners down the back straight as well as through the turn, could not find more down the lane and tired in the three path
with horses on both sides in mid-stretch. HE'S FULLY LOADED chased three wide outside horses down the backside, was starting to get out even under
right handed urging from the rider midway through the turn, bore out to the eight path at the top of the lane and faltered through the stretch.
