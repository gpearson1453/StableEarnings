Footnotes
DIVERTIDA pressed the pace while two wide down the backstretch, could not find room on the turn to bid thru and remained nicely rated along the rail close
behind the leaders, then dug in gamely in the upper stretch to take over the lead and was ridden out to the wire to prevail. HIGH CALIBER CATCH raced
along the rail behind the two fields of rivals down the backstretch, then slip thru on the turn to gain command and the quarter pole, then was out bid by outer
foe in the late stretch and held onto the place position. ALONG CAME THUNDER broke outwardly, then pressed the pace while for wide and outside of
rivals down the backstretch, was in a long drive in the turn, could not over bid inner rivals, and held the show position in the end. WESTERN SKY set the
pace by a nose down the backstretch and while in a strong drive, was overpowered by rivals leaving the turn and gave way in the stretch. HI LEE
FAVOREDCATS pressed the pace in the three path while in a hard drive and between rivals down the backstretch, could not retain bid on the turn, dropped
back and flattened out in the final quarter. ANNA MARIE was no menace. TWILIGHT STORM was no factor.

INSIGHTFUL MISS was away well then settled back and laid off the pace while two wide, then came out four wide leaving the turn and found the best stride
in the late stretch and was up at the wire to prove best. CAJUN NINJA broke well at the start, then pressed the pace while two wide, moved up to duel with
the pace setter leaving the turn and into the late stretch, battled grudgingly then was out finished by an outer foe and hung at the wire. MOZINGO hustled to
the front to set the pace from the inside, was confronted by an outer foe at the top of the turn to spar down the lane while in a gamely rally then was out
finished by INSIGHTFUL MISS in the end and held third. ROLLIN CHROME was allowed to settle along the inside, then came out three wide leaving the
turn to bid in the stretch and came up flat. THE RAGE OF ART was no threat.

USUALLY WRONG set the pace from the inside, cleared the turn while in a steady drive, then lugged out in the late stretch and was kept to task till the end
to prevail. CLASSIC RICK stalked the pace from the inside, then dug in gamely leaving the turn, steadied in the late stretch and kept on for the place prize
while in a mild rally. MY BUDDY MEL chased the pace from the inside then rallied leaving the turn and was up for the third position in the late stretch.
FIREBALL BIRDIE stalked the pace while three wide, then bid on the turn in attempt to over take the leader, lacked the winning stride and flattened out in
the stretch. TOOLPUSHER settled towards the back while two wide, then bid mildly leaving the turn and came up empty in the stretch. STRIKE RIDGE
stalked the pace while two wide, continued to pursue the leader on the turn while in a hard drive, was used up and tired in the late stretch. DARYLS TRUMP
CARD veered inwardly and was no menace. There was an INQUIRY and JOCKEY'S OBJECTION following the race. The rider of CLASSIC RICK claimed
foul against the rider of USUALLY WRONG for interference in the late stretch. After review, no change was made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
LEONE tracked the pace from the inside into the turn, then dug in gamely and swept by the pace setter in the late stretch to be up in the final strides to
prevail. JUST PLAIN BAD showed the way along the inside into the turn, was in a long drive in the late stretch then was out finished by an outer foe and
missed victory. MAGENS BAY saved ground in the early furlongs, then came out four wide leaving the turn to close willingly between rivals and was closing
in on the leaders and was best for the show prize in the end. ALLEGRODIMOLTO raced in the middle of the pack while three wide then rallied leaving the
turn and into the stretch to no avail in the end. MIZ RITHYM raced while four wide towards the back, then bid mildly leaving the turn and came up empty in
the stretch. SO THEY SAY raced from the inside in the middle of the pack at a moderate pace and needed more in the end. LOVE ME DO was unhurried
early and no threat. WITCH WAY GRAY chased the pace while two wide, then rallied on the turn before flattening out in the stretch. PALACSINTA raced in
the middle of the pack while two wide, then menaced on the turn but did not respond in the stretch. SHEZA SHENANIGAN was no rally.

THE GIRL IN RED remained well rated along the rail in the second flight of rivals, then came out four wide leaving the turn and surged down the lane to be
up in the final strides to prevail. EARLY SPRING set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive leaving the turn while being unchallenged then almost
lasted to the end while in a strong drive then was caught at the wire. CATHERINE BLAZE was brushed at the start, was unhurried early, then fanned out six
wide leaving the turn and closed willingly down the lane to finish well for the show prize. ROUGH CREEK chased the pace from the inside, gained second
position while in a strong bid on the turn then gave way in the late stretch. NATURAL TOUCH was no threat. ASSEMBLED STORM chased the pace while
two wide, was in a strong drive on the turn, lacked the winning bid and flattened out in the stretch. CINCO GAL was no threat. TOO MUCH GUITAR broke
outwardly and brushed foe, then settled along the inside towards the back, steadied in the late stretch and was no threat. DARE ME chased the pace while
three wide, was in a hard drive on the turn then flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
LEMONESSE prompted the pace while two wide, then inched up to vie between rivals leaving the turn, shook clear in the upper stretch and held on well to
prevail in the end. CURLIN'S MAGIC saved ground down the backstretch, remained well rated along the rail on the turn, then dug in gamely at the top of the
stretch, lugged out and kept on for the place prize. HOLLY DOLLY laid off the pace while four wide, then moved up swiftly to battle with inner foes on the
turn, lacked the winning bid and held the show prize in the end. MAGNOLIA AVENUE stalked the pace while three wide, then moved up to vie on the turn
while in a hard drive, steadied in the upper stretch avoiding inner foe, then gave way in the lane. AFFECTION led the way from the inside into the turn, was
met with outer foes to battle leaving the turn, was used up and tired in the late stretch. ART QUEEN was no threat. CAPETOWN CANDY was no menace.
LEXINGTON DIVA urged along the inside towards the back of the pack and did not fire in the late furlongs. PREDICTING was out run and no factor. There
was an INQUIRY in regards to interference in the stretch run. After review, CURLIN'S MAGIC was disqualified from second and placed fourth for impeding
rival in the late stretch.

EL QUESO GRANDE stalked the pace while two wide, inched up between rivals to battle for the lead leaving the turn, gained command at the top of the
stretch then drew clear in the final yards to prevail. DELTA FRONT tracked the pace from the inside, then came out four wide leaving the turn to rally in the
stretch and closed well for the place prize. DARK RUM broke inwardly at the start, then settled towards the back while tow wide, bid leaving the turn and
closed willingly down the lane and was up for third place. I'M NO JOKE pursued the pace while four wide, then moved up to vie with inner foes on the turn,
then was out finished in the late stretch and missed the show prize. ZED set the pace from the inside, was met with outer foes on the turn to battle it out
gamely, then gave way in the stretch. SLEW SKIES was no threat. SAFE BET settled at the back and was no rally. FEEL IT drifted in at the start and was
