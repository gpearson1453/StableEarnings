moved up, no threat. THE BEST OF BEACH no menace. MG PILOT BOI close early, faded. DIVINE MISS B no factor. MISS ROYALLY JETTIN no impact.
LETHAL WAGON always last. AP TEMPTING SICARIA reared start, lost rider, walked off. A STEWARD'S INQUIRY INTO THE START FOUND THAT #5
AP TEMPTING SICARIA HAD A FAIR CHANCE AT THE BREAK AND CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS.
