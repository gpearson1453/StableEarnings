Footnotes
HAPPY TO PLEASE moved off the inside to pressure the winner up the backstretch, tried that one from the outside in the turn, lost some ground to that one
exiting the turn, trying to get back to that same foe late while remaining clear of the others. TUATHA forwardly placed early, began a steady retreat after a
quarter, trailed home. CAMS HOTROD lacked early foot, finished up best of rest. BROOKE'S ALL IN last to leave, never menaced. SHESPUN broke on top,
showed the way out of the chute, dropped to the inside while continuing to set the pace up the backstretch, turned back a bid from the runner up exiting the
turn, clear upper stretch, held that same foe at bay late under steady handling. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using
video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
WRANGLERED stalked the two early leaders in the three path, moved on that pair late backstretch to challenge between rivals, came in slightly to tighten
up a pair of inner rivals entering the second turn, dueled closest to the rail into the stretch, edged away under steady handling. HUNTER QUICK last away,
moved up to be forwardly placed four wide and outside the winner into and through the first turn, moved with that one to challenge with just over a quarter
remaining, dueled with that save rival through the final turn, could not match strides through the stretch, fully extended to preserve the second spot. WHIP
broke on top, dueled up front in the two path, in tight, shuffled into the far turn when the winner came in, recovered, getting back to the top two late from the
outside. HEADEDTOTHESTARS dueled up front closest to the inside, continued to vie up the backstretch along the inside, in tight, checked up into the far
turn, fell back. GOSPEL DANDY shuffled back to trail past the wire the first time, continued well back and lacked a closing response. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN INTO THE FAR TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and
was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

PATRIOTIC DUTY broke out and back back, moved up to vie up front three wide before a quarter, continued to contest the issue three wide through the
second bend, spurted clear far turn, remained clear into the lane, held the runner up safe late under firm handling. STOCKPILER also broke back while
being bothered slightly by the winner, lacked speed four seven furlongs, began to rally while four wide turning for home, finished willingly to be getting to the
winner late. FRIDAYNIGHTSOLDIER dueled early in the two path, contested the issue up front while between foes the middle half mile, weakened final turn,
finished up best of the rest. RACE DAY REBAL bobbled at the break, quickly recovered to set or force the pace along the rail for six furlongs, weakened
thereafter. DR VINNIE BOOMBATZ finished early, fell far back. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology
to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
ROYALLY settled in the second flight while off the inside, continued to stalk the middle half mile, ranged up three wide to challenge late in the final turn,
kicked clear when straightened for home. GUINESSEY dueled up front in the two path under loose restraint, continued to alternate for the lead out of the
second turn and up the backstretch, briefly vied between foes and inside the runner up exiting the final bend then proved no match, held sway for the place
late. WILBERT set or forced the pace while also rating a bit the opening three quarters, weakened gradually through the stretch, outkicked for the place.
TOMMYHAWK last to leave, void of speed for six furlongs, crept closer along the inside late in the final turn, failed to sustain that advance through the lane.
This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

DENISES DOLLY away in good order, dueled up front along the inside, fell back the middle three furlongs, rebid up the rail late, up at wire. O S U BUDKE
away well, dueled up front in the two path, shook clear before a half, continued to show the way into the lane in the two path, allowed the winner the inside,
outkicked late. LADY RASHEN settled in the second flight three wide, raced within striking distance, lacked a winning punch in the lane. AUTO BE A STAR
a bit rank at the start, four wide into the first turn, lacked a closing kick. TAKEMETOYOURLAIR off a step slow, in some traffic into the first turn, fell back and
trailed to the finish. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
GOSPEL SPEAR unhurried early off the inside, continued to be outrun for a half, commenced her rally far turn, dropped to the rail late in that bend to cut the
corner into the stretch, kept coming up the rail to be in plenty of time. FLY FENIX FLY away well, dueled early off the inside, cleared toward the rail late
backstretch, continued to hold the advantage upper stretch, allowed the winner the inside late and proved no match. THAROLITE chased the dueling
leaders early, moved closest to the winner far turn, chased that one into the lane, lacked a serious closing punch. SLICK CITY GIRL behind the pace well
out in the strip early, four wide first turn, continued one paced to finish up evenly while also lacking a winning response. GOSPEL FREELY last away,
remained always back. COMPETITIVE SPIRIT broke with leaders, dueled inside the runner up early, stopped after a half, jogged in late. This race had a
timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
GOSPEL EXPRESSION broke sharp from the outside, set a pressured pace up the backstretch the first time, rated kindly the middle half mile, kicked well
clear from the quarter mile marker in to win ridden out. CHEEKY KISS pressed the winner early from along the inside, chased that one onto the backstretch
the second turn, proved no match for that one thereafter, clearly second best. GOSPEL GORGEOUS one paced while racing off the inside, proved no
match for the top two, well clear of the others. SNOWBIRD steadied and was shuffled back in some traffic just after the start, also went one paced
throughout in lacking a closing response. SWEET THELMA JEAN last to leave, void of early foot, never threatened. UNBRIDLED KISSES within striking
distance the opening quarter, began a steady retreat before a half, well beaten. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using
video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
