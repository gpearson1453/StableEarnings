Footnotes
CHAOS REIGNS took control shortly from the gate, set a well rated, well measured pace on a clear lead and was never seriously challenged in a well
handled ride. JET FLIGHT stalked the pacesetter throughout, could not gain on the winner, kept-on well in the lane drifting out slightly in mid-stretch and
finished willingly. SLAVA UKRAINI tracked the leaders into the turn, rallied five wide to loom nearing the quarter pole, hung down the stretch while drifting in,
bumping and then impeding HANDSOFFTHE GOODS in mid-stretch and finished evenly. HANDSOFFTHEGOODS prompted the pace through the turn, lost
position in upper stretch, fought on in the lane, was bounced between rivals in mid-stretch and further impeded when SLAVA UKRAINI, crossed inward
several paths causing the rider to check and angle out, and kept on to the wire. PLAIN OR PEANUT was one-paced posing no threat. JIM AND JIM
hesitated at the start to drop back and be the trailer and was never a factor from there. THE RIDER OF HANDSOFFTHEGOODS CLAIMED FOUL FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SLAVA UKRAINI AND PLACED HIM FOURTH.

Footnotes
DOCS SEVEN tracked the leaders from striking distance through the turn, rallied six wide down the lane in a determined drive to catch the pacesetter in
deep stretch and be clear at the wire. GET THE CANDY set the pace on a well measured lead, responded when called upon turning for home to open a
clear advantage and was caught late in the lane. MOVE IT BABY stalked the pace to the top of the lane and failed to mount a closing rally while keeping on
to be best of the rest. LIPLINER stumbled at the start, bumped rival while regaining balance, recovered quickly to race mid-pack and showed late interest
while working through traffic in the stretch. APRIL'S GEM reserved off the pace to the lane and mounted a mild rally in the stretch. PALACE MAGIC raced
mid-pack without impact. RAMBERT pressed the pace to the top of the lane and faded. ADIOS MUCHACHAS was not a threat. NIFF was not a factor.

PERFORMANCE PLUS unhurried early to be near the rear, made a steady advance on the far turn while saving ground, sustained the bid down the lane,
rider lost the crop near the sixteenth pole and prevailed by the shortest of margins. PRINCE IS MY BOY stalked the pace for a half mile, rallied four wide
into the turn, engaged the pacesetter in deep stretch, took the lead briefly, battled the winner to the wire and came up just short in a good effort. MINING
CAMP set the pace opening a clear advantage turning for home, held that lead to deep stretch and weakened inside the final sixteenth. MONEY AGENT
tracked the leaders, made an early bid down the backside and failed to sustain the rally coming home evenly. SKYLANE went one-paced without impact.
POND passed tiring rivals having been no threat. SECRET HONOR showed brief speed, gave way turning for home and galloped home. RAYFIELD was
outrun.

TABLE MONEY reserved off the early pace, steadily gained ground on the turn rallying three wide, angled to the seven path in upper stretch and closed well
to be along in time the beneficiary of a good ride. ARTHURIAN unhurried early to be near the rear of the field, made a steady advance while saving ground
and was gaining up the fence late in the lane. CONGRATS ON FIFTY pressed the pace to the quarter pole, took the lead in mid-stretch and was outkicked
late in the drive. WHERE YA AT VINCE dueled on the lead from two wide to mid-stretch and weakened late. GIMME THE CANDY tracked the leaders to the
head of the stretch, angled eight wide and mounted a mild bid in the lane. CODE NAME well placed to be in striking distance into the turn, made a tthree
wide bid to loom and flattened out coming home. TWIRLING ROSES failed to menace. MAN ON ATTACK rank early, settled to chase the pack through the
turn and was never a threat. ON K P was not a factor.

IMAGE OF CURLIN tracked the leaders from a clear pocket through the turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the lane and finished well to overtake
the pacesetter inside the eighth pole and was going away in deep stretch. ANNA AFTER MIDNITE sped off to quickly open a clear advantage, maintained
that lead to mid-stretch and tired late in the lane. BABAS GAL reserved off the pace and passed weaker rivals to be along for the show. GOOD MAGIC
WOMAN bumped leaving the gate, settled near the rear of the field and went evenly without impact. ARRINGTON was not a factor. LOST SUNSET chased
the pacesetter down the backstretch, made a brief bid nearing the three-eights pole and gave way turning for home.

WHAT'S TO DO reserved off the pace early, was well placed just off the pace four wide down the backside, angled in saving ground on the far turn, split
rivals leaving the quarter pole to mount a stretch rally from three wide, split the leaders inside the eighth pole forcing his way through the hole and took over
late in great ffort and a great ride. LEIPZIG stalked the pace through the far turn, rallied up the inside to be prominent in dep stretch and was outkicked late.
BLAZE BEAUTY unhurried early and rallied well in the lane showing good energy. ALEXANDRA'S SONG took the lead from the gate racing headstrong,
resisted the rider through the turn, settled into stride down the backside on a clear lead, held that advantage to mid-stretch and tired. WRITTEN CONSENT
tracked the leaders and lacked a closing bid. MS KS DYNASTY raced mid-pack down the backside, circled wide to loom turning for home and flattened out
in the lane. TWAS LOLA prompted the pace from three wide to the far turn, rallied to threaten on the bend and faded coming home. PACIFIC VIEW was not
a threat. SEQUAYA was not a factor.

Footnotes
WENT WEST settled in hand off the pace, made a steady advance from four wide on the turn, found best stride in mid-stretch to run the pacesetter down
and be going away late. ELI'S PROMISE sped off to a clear lead shortly from the gate, maintained that lead to the eighth pole and was out-finished by the
winner. NAVY SEAL unhurried early to be near the back of the pack, swung out six wide turning for home and was gaining late. ABSOLUTE CHAOS stalked
the pacesetter to the head of the lane and lacked a closing response. CORTESE slow early to be the trailer and passed tiring rivals while rallying along the
fence. SHACKLEFORD STRONG tracked the leaders for a half and faded in the lane. GO EMI well placed stalking from between rivals around the bend
and gave way turning for home. THREEFIFTYSEVEN stumbled leaving the gate and was no factor from there.

Footnotes
EVEN THE WIND taken in hand early to be rated off the pace, angled in saving ground first turn, raced mid-pack to the far turn, rallied six wide at the head
of the lane and finsihed well to be along in time. WOLF HUNTER reserved off the pace, rallied seven wide down the lane to chase the winner home as
second best. SPINNING HEART pressed the pace throughout, battling for the lead to mid-stretch and was out kicked by the clsoers while having put in a
game effort. NOT FALLING BACK set a pressured pace from the rail dueling for nearly a mile and weakened in deep stretch in a good try. INTERLUDE
tracked the leaders to the far turn, rallied up the rail to loom nearing the quarter pole and flattened out in mid-stretch. SHARP STRIKE passed tiring rivals.
REGIMENTAL went evenly. LAST RUN well placed just of the dueling pacesetters to midway on the far turn and lacked a response when called upon.
SHTARKER was not a factor. THE WINNING NUMBERS IN THE PLACE PICK 8 WERE: 2/3-6/7-7/8-2/4-2/4/5/6-2/6/9-4/6-1/9.

Footnotes
GO STORMIN GIRL tracked the leaders into the turn, swept up four wide to take command nearing the quarter pole and drew off unchallenged. TAP N
TWINE slow early to be at the back of the main body of the field, made a steady advance and finished well up the inside to be second best. OPALINE sped
to the lead to midway on the turn, had no response when engaged by the winner and tired down the stretch. SHEZ RECKLESS chased the leaders into the
bend, steadied when in tight midway on the turn and kept-on evenly. SMILE AT THE STORM pressed the pace for three-eighths and gradually gave way.
GHAALEB'S MAGIC failed to menace. PLAY TWENTY fractious in the gate, dwelt when the doors opened and lost all chance giving the field fifteen lengths.
