Footnotes
CHIEF ALPHA saved ground while settling near the back through the final turn then made a rail bid down the stretch to be up in the final jumps. DUDE
DROP KID tracked the leaders from the inside through the final turn then angled out to two wide in upper stretch for a late run and was outkicked by inside
rival. READY SHOES went to the front to set most of the pace while being pressured, edged away into the stretch to fight gamely but gave way grudgingly.
STIFF DRINK settled in the middle of the pack through the final turn from two wide then made a mild late bid to be best of the rest. WITCH'S VOW stalked
the pace from three wide to the top of the stretch but lacked the late response. PREFERITO DA BARBI vied for the lead two wide to midway through the
final turn and gave way. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY raced three wide and was never a threat.

Footnotes
MY IDEA broke well then talked the pace from two wide through the turn then made a stretch bid to run down the leader and cleared late under steady
urging. CAROLINA JACY went to the front to a clear unchallenged lead through the turn the drew off but was collared in the final sixteenth and was second
best. WHEELS LIKE NALA saved ground throughout while racing evenly and was no match for the top two. MID WEST FUN raced in the middle of the pack
from two wide through the turn and showed late interest but had no impact. OUR INDIAN GIRL was unhurried down the backstretch then made a middle
move on the turn but flattened out. REINA'S VISION settled in the middle of the pack from three wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LITTLE E pressed the pace from two wide down the backstretch then took the lead midway through the final turn, inched away in the stretch and was kept to
task. PINCHING PENNIES stalked the pace from three wide through the final turn then made the late stretch run but couldn't catch the leader and proved
second best. RIPTIDE ROSE tracked the leaders from the inside through the final turn then angled out to two wide in upper stretch, showed the late kick
and missed the place. SMART IZZY was restless in the gate, then was allowed to settled near the back to the top of the stretch, angled out to five wide and
made a late rally. MEGANS MILLIONS saved ground while racing off the pace through the final turn then angled out to four wide in upper stretch but lacked
the late response. COUSIN VICKIE was allowed to settle near the back through the first turn then made a rail bid on the backstretch and kept on but failed
to menace. COUNTRY BELLE stalked the pace from two wide around the first turn then started to drop back down the backstretch and was never a factor.
QUEEN OF THE MOON was off a step slow and raced near the back around the first turn then moved up on the backstretch and passed tired one in the
stretch. AURORA AUSTRALIS went to the lead to set the pressured pace to midway through the final turn and gave way in the stretch. DADDY'S
CINDERELLA trailed and was outrun.

Footnotes
PNEUMA prompted the pace from two wide then moved between horses at the half mile marker to match strided inside of KERRIGAN'S TOUCH to midway
through the stretch and won going away. KERRIGAN'S TOUCH hustled away and stalked the pace from three wide then engaged the leader and matched
strides with PNEUMA to midway through the stretch but couldn't overtake and was second best. HONDURAS PASSION raced off the pace from between
horses then moved up from three wide on the turn and gave a late effort but was no match for for the top two. INSPECTOR PENNY chased the leaders from
the inside and maintained. MDA SENORITA RUN raced near the back from the three path, moved up on the turn from four wide and passed tired one in the
stretch. TEKANA sprinted up the rail to take the lead at the five furlong marker but was overtaken at the three furlong marker and gave way. DEES LITTLE
GIRL was never involved.

from between horsed on the turn and gave the late kick to be up for the show. ROBO was forwardly placed and made a four wide bid on the turn but
faltered. DIXIE STREET saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack but made a late rally to improve position. TWENTY TO PARK showed no early
speed and passed tiring rivals. UPTOWN HUSTLER raced in the middle of the pack and was not a threat. PESO IN MY POCKET raced off the pace from
three wide, moved up to engage the leader at the quarter pole but was empty. HUEY DUEY was void of speed and not a factor.

Footnotes
EUROSTORM pressed the pace from two wide on the backstretch and took the lead at the half mile marker, edged away on the turn and kept to task in the
stretch. CALLING stalked the pace from four wide on the backstretch then made a bid on the turn but couldn't catch the leader and flattened out. ADDI BUG
rushed up to vie for the lead from the inside in the early going then settled off the pace around the turn and was gaining in the stretch to be a clear third.
LAKE BALI showed no early speed but gained ground on the turn, angled out to three wide in upper stretch for a late rally. KATIE'S C raced off the pace
and was not a factor. HOPEITSMYLUCKYDAY chased the leaders and was not a threat. I'M ALL MIXED UP hustled along between horses to vied for the
early lead then took a brief lead at the half mile marker but gave way at the three furlong marker.

Footnotes
FREEDOM FACTOR went to the front to an unchallenged lead to set all the pace and drew off in the stretch. HARD LOVE was steadied going into the first
turn then settled off the pace down the backstretch and made a rail bid in the stretch but was no match for the winner but was a clear second. EGO raced in
the middle of the pack from two wide then moved up on the final turn and shifted in going into the stretch and closed well to be up for the show. COLOR
FAST raced near the back down the backstretch then moved up from three wide on the final turn and shifted out to four wide in the stretch for a late rally.
FIFTEEN LOVE BACK raced in the middle of the pack on the inside but fell back on the run, shifted out to five wide in upper stretch for a mid track rally but
failed to menace. COMPUTATION was forwardly placed from two wide through the turn but lacked the late response. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN was in tight
going into the first turn and had to check hard and was rank around the first turn and remained back. TWITTY CITY tracked the leaders from two wide to the
final turn and retreated. FIRST LINE was bumped leaving the starting gate and trailed while racing wide throughout, showed little.
