through the stretch run and was even with no closing run. MEGASTAR hustled along early, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch,
forced to check near the eighth pole and never threatened. BIG BOY JAK prompt two deep from the outside of the early leader and gave way in the drive.

FROSTED FAITH rated to race in hand early from the outside of rivals, asked three wide through the far turn and edged clear late under steady pressure.
RICHY chased the early going between rivals, raced four wide in the drive and narrowly edged up for the place position late. NEOPHYTE quick to begin to
clear off to the early lead, was collared near the eighth pole by Frosted Faith and gave way grudgingly. WARLORD CRUZAN coaxed along early, had an
inside run around the far turn through the stretch and no final winning bid. EXECUTIVE SEARCH raced off the early pace, was five wide into the upper
stretch and had not enough in the drive. VOLTAMOUR was void early speed and never menaced. ALFIO raced near the back early on, saved ground
through the far turn and had no late response. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO
TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

Footnotes
KOZEM settled off the early going, asked through the far turn, raced five wide into the upper stretch and finished strongly to edge away under steady
pressure. BURN THE BREEZE rated along early to race in hand, hard ridden three deep near the quarter pole, led narrowly near the eighth pole but was no
match for the winner late. UPSTREET was unhurried early on, waited for racing room just past the quarter pole, shifted out two to three wide and rallied up
for the show placing between rivals late. BONNIE SANDRA raced near the back early on, loomed six wide into the upper stretch and flattened out in the
drive. SHUT IT CALI raced off early pace setters, moved up four wide near the quarter pole, shifted in forcing Tovia to take up, had aim inside the eighth
pole and weakened. TOVIA forwardly placed early on, raced two deep midway through the far turn, forced to check near the quarter pole and tired readily
thereafter. WILDCAT LUNITA showed good early foot to set the early pace and stopped through the stretch run. CHASING SILVER broke awkwardly, race
mid pack between early, tired readily and was eased up on through the stretch.

Footnotes
CAJUN FANTASY steadied between rivals in the early stages, moved up three wide around the far turn, dug in racing from the far outside and just got up
under strong pressure. GRAYTANA prompt the early leader two deep from the outside, dug in between mid stretch and finished gamely to the wire. R
FIREBIRD set a pressured early pace from the inside of rivals and gave way grudgingly to the top pair in the final stages. Jockey of R Firebird claimed
objection against Graytana for interference through the stretch run and stewards ruled no change. GREEK MOJO hustled along early, had an inside run
around the far turn through the stretch and had no final winning bid. VELOCISSIMA chased the pace from the outside of rivals, raced five wide into the
upper stretch and raced even with no closing run. WHATS GOIN ON chased the top pair from the inside and weakened. DEVRA WARRIOR dropped back
early and failed to respond. STRATEGY QUEEN was off slowly, shifted in down the backstretch, raced the rail past the quarter pole and never threatened.

Footnotes
SOPHIA'S STORM rated along to race in hand early, slipped through a narrow opening through the far turn near the rail, continued its inside run through the
stretch and drew off to be well clear under strong encouragement. MY LADY JAMES was sent off to a clear early lead, challenged just past the quarter pole
racing two deep and was no match late for the winner. SIN FOR A SEASON chased the early leader two deep from the outside, tipped out four wide into the
upper stretch and weakened in the latter stages. MAMA MARIA was off a step slow, saved ground and never threatened. OLYMPIC PRANK coaxed along
to lay up close, hard ridden four wide from the outside of rivals near the quarter pole and faded. EUPHIMA (ARG) broke awkwardly, six wide around the far
turn, raced from the far outside in the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
NINA'S LAST GIFT was sent to a clear early lead and drew off to be well clear under a steady hand ride. SISTER SERENDIPITY was off slowly, raced at
the back of the pack after the poor start, moved up from the outside through the far turn, raced six wide into the upper stretch rallied late for the place
position. REPAYNT rated along, raced near the inside throughout and had not enough in the drive. FAR ABOVE stalked the pace, ridden along into the far
turn, raced four wide into the upper lane and was even with no closing run. GHOSTS LIL SECRET dropped back to race near the back early on, ridden
along three to four wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. AWESOME EMPRESS prompt outside of the early leader and faded. FAMILY STASH raced
with the second flight early, saved ground and was outrun.
