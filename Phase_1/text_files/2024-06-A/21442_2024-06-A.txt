bid but couldn't close late. PILLOW DROP was off a step slow, bid in the three path on the far turn and rallied belatedly inside. WILLADEAN was clear early
but couldn't last. SHAKIN IT UP BABY trailed before finding her best stride late in the four path. TAP THE LINE saved ground, bid at the eighth pole and
faltered. FRONT COVER stalked the pace in the four path before fading. CLASSIC KITTEN was unrushed and lacked a late bid. SALTY SUE stalked the

Footnotes
SRI LANKA stalked the pace in the three path and drew off in the stretch under a strong hand ride. MISCHIEF LILY was bumped at the start, was unrushed
early, bid in the three path at the three-eighths pole and couldn't close late. WHY WASTE WORDS stalked the pace in the two path, bid in early stretch and
faltered. TIDAL TACTICS bid in the four path at the half-mile pole but couldn't close late. DONA WITCH bore out at the start, raced inside and bid in the
three path at the quarter pole. CAT'S SYMPHONY raced inside, angled four wide at the quarter pole but had no late bid. DE LUNA pressed the early pace
in the three path but faded in the stretch. CANDY CAUSE was no factor. FAITHFUL STEPS was clear early but gave way in the stretch. WICKED
BEAUTIFUL was not a factor. ANQA was off awkwardly, pressed the pace and gave way near the half-mile pole.
