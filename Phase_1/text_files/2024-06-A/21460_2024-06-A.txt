HAPPYISASHAPPYDOES sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task.
EXTRASEXYBIGDADDEE never far back, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, then could not threaten
the winner, while clearly best of the rest. BRUMBA WAFFLE TOES tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, then lost some ground in the stretch and held the show. DECLARED passed tiring rivals. CANDIDATE stalked the pace on the outside, and faded
on the two path through the second turn. FRANZ JOSEF hopped at the start, was well placed outside, then faded four wide through the second turn.
