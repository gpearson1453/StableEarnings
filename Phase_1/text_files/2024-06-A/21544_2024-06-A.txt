Footnotes
PATRIA bobbled slightly at the break, rated along the inner rail around the turn, eased off the rail in upper stretch, closed, split foes late and narrowly
prevailed. PRINCESSOFTHENORTH , along the inner rail on the turn, eased out approaching the stretch, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied
outside horses. BULLOCK disputed the pace outside GIFT OF GAB and weakened late. GIFT OF GAB showed speed along the rail, was nursed along
while disputing the pace, set down in mid stretch and weakened. PINOTSLILGIRL hopped at the break, was well off the rail leaving the backstretch, had her
heels clipped entering the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, steadied when carried out a bit by FORGOTTEN GIFT in mid stretch and finished
willingly. MELIPONINI BEE stumbled when clipping the heels of POINOTSLILGIRL entering the turn and failed to be a factor. GIRLS HOUSE lacked speed
and steadied in traffic entering the turn. FORGOTTEN GIFT stalked the duel while three deep on the turn, drifted out in mid stretch and gave way. PEACE
OUT , wide on the turn, was outrun.

Footnotes
IRISH BANDIT , away well, prompted the pace outside BOX N BEN, took over leaving the three eighths, edged clear and shifted in towards the rail, kept on
under strong handling through the final furlong and held sway. BOX N BEN took over between rivals early, secured the inside and set a pressured pace,
ceded the lead three furlongs out, stayed on to be in close attendance past the five sixteenths, shifted out for a clear run in upper stretch, ranged up outside
the winner, kept on gamely but was denied. HAMPDEN LANE flashed speed inside rivals then drafted off the pace, was under asking in the clear and
towards the inner rail mid turn, made a mild run along the inside nearing mid stretch, flattened out but held down the show. COUNT DADDY rated back off
the heels of an outer rival leaving the five eighths, raced well back mid turn, came four wide for the drive but failed to generate a serious run. I HAD
ENOUGH broke a step slow, raced off the pace and towards the inside then failed get involved through the drive. PERSPICACIOUS BOY broke awkwardly
and outward, corrected and edged up three wide nearing the half, chased the leaders to the head of the lane then gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
CONTINENTALCONGRES took over into the first turn and rated kindly on the lead, remained under confident handling while being shadowed by
PRINCESS INDY leaving the three eighths, responded when set down off the rail near mid stretch, drifted a bit while under strong encouragement inside the
sixteenth marker and held firm to the wire. PRINCESS INDY stumbled at the break, quickly recovered and took a briefly early lead off the inside, ceded to
the winner into the first turn then relaxed outside that one through the backstretch, was put to a ride maintaining position past the five sixteenths, gave hard
chase through the lane and held well to be clear of the rest. SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE , well placed tracking towards the inner rail, was under pressure with
aim into the stretch, remained a presence past mid stretch then faded late. REGALED lagged back off the pace while saving ground, angled out in upper
stretch but lacked a serious finish. HAINT BLUE lagged off the pace and outside a rival into the backstretch, moved up slightly nearing the half while guided
inside, remained inside into the stretch and came up empty. PISTOL LIZ ABLAZEN , three wide, steadily advanced under a ride leaving the far turn, chased
to upper stretch then weakened.

Footnotes
CUT FROM CLASS prompted the pace outside PREMISEHER AMERICA, led late and was under brisk urging. PROMISEHER AMERICA , taken to the
inner rail approaching the first turn, set a pressured pace and gave way grudgingly. CHARMED WAY , a forward factor three wide around both turns, offered
a mild, late gain. GO BIG GREEN lacked speed, worked between horses in the stretch, moved outside near the sixteenth pole and closed willingly. PATTY
CAKES stayed along the inner rail throughout and failed to rally. GOLD DIGGING BROAD , three wide the first turn, circled the far turn four wide and lacked
a rally. GALILEI , in the two path between horses most of the trip, chased and weakened. NORTHERN GLOW remained along the inner rail and dropped
back.

WITHOUT PRETENCE , patiently handled while saving ground and well within range of the embattled leaders, eased out mid turn, shifted to about the
seven path in upper stretch, sustained a grinding run under pressure, took over outside the duelers in deep stretch and drew clear. CAR RIDE broke on top
despite a bobble, tracked four wide outside rivals, bid three deep near the three eighths, sparred four wide outside LUCKY PRINCE into the lane, fought on
between horses leaving the furlong grounds, gave way grudgingly and held down the place. SKYLAR'S BROTHER had speed then was eased back off the
leaders heading towards the five eighths pole, rated just behind the trio of leaders leaving the three eighths, altered out five wide soon into the lane, ranged
up to challenge, sparred past mid stretch then hung late. LUCKY PRINCE dueled three wide on a slim lead outside a rival into the turn, emerged in scrum to
the inside of CAR RIDE leaving the five sixteenths, entered the lane in the three path, stayed on inside foes leaving mid stretch then weakened through the
final seventy yards. HANKSDIVININGROD broke a step slow then was gunned up inside rivals leaving the chute and contested the pace, stayed on past the
five sixteenths then gave way. SILENT ROAR stumbled at the break and unseated his rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start. No action was
taken.

CHELONIAN , three wide both turns, bid for the lead in upper stretch, battled outside PORQUEROLLES and determinedly prevailed. PORQUEROLLES
stalked the pace, raced in the two path between horses the far turn, advanced inside the winner to gain a short lead in mid stretch then was out finished.
ALWAYS GAMBLING , never far turn, worked between horses in the stretch and rallied. BLAME THE TUX , three wide the first turn, prompted the pace
outside ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE and faded the final furlong. GOD IS LOVE saved ground the first turn, lacked speed to the far turn, swung wide in upper
stretch and rallied mildly. VAX A NATION worked between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. MISSIONAIRE bumped with MOSLER TIME leaving
the starting gate, raced outside horses in the stretch and was not a factor. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE set the pace along the inner rail to upper stretch and
gave way. HARD TRAVELER , very wide the far turn, was outrun. MOSLER TIME bumped with MISSIONAIRE leaving the starting gate, was not a factor
and steadied on a rival's heels in mid stretch. FUN NOTION , a forward factor along the inner rail, checked in tight quarters entering the stretch and was
eased. HYTECK PRINCE pulled up leaving the backstretch and walked off.

Footnotes
SPLENDOR BEAUTY , eager to the front, set a rated pace towards the inside while handling outside pressure, spurted clear soon into stretch, drifted out a
bit from left handed asks past the three sixteenths, corrected with strong right handed encouragement and dug in tenaciously to fend off JOLLY BY GOLLY.
JOLLY BY GOLLY broke a beat slow, quickly recovered and moved up between rivals, prompted the pace two to three wide outside the winner, saw that
one get away a bit in upper stretch, came back on in gritty fashion through the final sixteenth but wasn't quite good enough. GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR
stalked the leaders while saving ground, was under a ride to hold a forward spot mid turn, remained inside for the stretch run and churned on to gain the
show. CIRCLE P stalked three wide, was pushed along mid turn, circled four wide with pursuit into the stretch but came up empty. PATIENT CAPITAL , in
range while off the inside, was coaxed along between runners approaching the stretch but failed to generate a solid finish.

Footnotes
DIVINE ROMANCE , rated outside horses down the backstretch, circled the turn five deep, bid for the lead outside SHEHERHERS in upper stretch, battled
with that one and drove clear late. SHEHERHERS advanced four wide on the turn, took the lead entering the stretch, fought inside the winner and gave way
grudgingly. ALWAYS FORWARD lacked speed, raced wide on the turn and had a slight rally. CLOSERTOTHEHEART stalked the pace, raced in the four
path between horses mid way on the turn and weakened in the stretch. EARLEY ROSE raced along the rail into the turn, moved out leaving the turn, raced
between rivals into the stretch and came up empty. BEATIFUL KARLA chased the pace in the three path to the stretch and gave way inside horses.
FAINOR'S FILETS disputed the pace in the two path between horses and gave way leaving the turn. DESTINED TO DANCE was outrun. LA SAMANA
LAURA hugged the inner rail while disputing the pace and faltered leaving the turn.
