Footnotes
ACE IT broke alertly and was well clear soon after the start, hugged the inner rail, was hooked by KITTY'S SON approaching the stretch, dug in tenaciously
and came home with a loose right rein the final seventy yards. KITTY'S SON advanced in the two path mid way on the turn, prompted the winner through
the stretch and missed in a game effort. FREEDOM STANCE bore out after breaking slowly, saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch
and rallied. FEAR NOTHING , well positioned along the inner rail on the turn, angled to the two path leaving the bend and weakened.
REPEATINGOFCOURSE stumbled leaving the starting gate, floated three wide entering the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
GOGO CHANEL , a bit rank under restraint while saving ground into the first turn, bounced off the rail and bumped with a rival soon after, regrouped inside
to edged forward then steadied back off of a foe nearing the five eighths, came back on while saving ground heading to the half, awaited room behind a
quartet of rivals near the quarter pole, eased out briefly then shifted back in to take advantage of a rail opening, surged inside foes and poked a head in
front leaving mid stretch, dueled with CATCH THE KITTEN from there and dug in tenaciously under strong handling to prove best. CATCH THE KITTEN
steadied when in close soon into the first turn, recovered and rated off the inside, took closer order into the far turn, swung out from behind the embattled
leaders entering the lane and straightened to be about five wide, moved up to gain a brief advantage in mid stretch, battled gamely outside the winner but
wasn't quite good enough. CRIMSON PRINCESS , between runners into the first turn, bumped soundly with the winner nearing the three quarter pole,
recovered and moved up three wide between runners to stalk, bid three deep leaving the far turn, dueled and gained a short lead four wide into the stretch,
fought on between rivals leaving mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. SEAFARER saved ground and lacked a serious finish. OUT OF LUCK cleared
around the first turn, set the pace towards the inner rail, met outside bids leaving the far turn, sparred inside foes into the stretch, stayed on willingly past the
eighth pole then faded. HAZELMOOR BEACH , bumped and in tight at the break, steadied behind rivals soon into the first turn, recovered to race three
wide, gained nearing mid stretch then flattened out. SALTY GIRL , three deep the first turn, edged up to stalk near the five eighths, bid into the far turn then
battled between horses from the three eighths to upper stretch, remained a presence to mid stretch then gave way. WATER WITCH , forward early, dropped
back between runners through the backstretch then came up empty. INSIDE THE BOX drifted in at the break bumping with a foe, lost ground four wide
advancing past the three quarter pole, chased to the far turn then weakened.

Footnotes
DOCTOR JEFF had speed then was rated back off of an outer rival, angled out and tracked under confident handling, cruised up to engage the leader
nearing the lane, spurted clear past the quarter pole, responded to firm asks leaving mid stretch then kept on with good energy through the wire. MID DAY
IMAGE rated forwardly while saving ground, eased out soon into the lane, gave futile chase past mid stretch, continued well but had to settle for second.
WHERE'S RAY , off slowly after he leaned inward and hit the gate, regrouped to pull his way forward, rated in the clear and off the inside mid turn, circled
three wide into the stretch, was guided outward near the three sixteenths, switched over to his left lead in deep stretch and churned on. NOBLE EMOTION ,
snugly rated stalking outside a rival, angled four wide under coaxing in upper stretch, gave chase past mid stretch but finished evenly. BY THE SEY SHORE
saved ground, eased out in upper stretch, advanced between rivals near the sixteenth pole but needed more late. EMBOLDEN , unruly behind the gate,
hopped up at the break, raced outside a rival while off the pace into the turn, angled out for the drive and offered a slight kick. B DETERMINED , well back
saving ground, eased out in upper stretch but failed to generate a significant response. VOCALIZE broke a step slow, saved ground under some rating,
lightly steadied nearing the turn then lacked a rally. JOHN HALL , off the pace while saving ground, lacked a rally. SHIP THE GOODS sped up outside the
winner then cleared early, dropped in to set the pace, was joined nearing the lane, stayed on past the three sixteenths then gave way through the final
furlong.

sixteenth pole and drew off. FIRST TO ARRIVE disputed the early pace outside ITALIAN WAR CRY opened up leaving the backstretch, remained in front to
mid stretch and finished gamely while no match for the winner. ENEMYNUMBERNINE worked between horses on the turn, swung outside in upper stretch
and rallied mildly. DROPPING LEMONS , a forward factor inside horses on the turn chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. DIAMOND SUE ,
steadied after bobbling and bearing out leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four wide and passed tired horses. HOT DANCE raced well off the inner rail
on the turn and gave way. ENKINDLE was checked in tight quarters near the five sixteenths pole. ITALIAN WAR CRY hugged the inner rail disputing the
early pace, gave way leaving the turn and was eased.

turn, swung out seven wide into the lane, closed stoutly outside rivals and under right handed asks, forged to command near the sixteenth pole then eagerly
drew clear. NINJA ABARRIO , forced out a bit nearing the first turn, regrouped and settled off the inside, gained four wide into the lane, was briefly stalled
near the three sixteenths, picked things back up and split rivals leaving mid stretch, kept on well and earned the place in the final yards. SWEET MIMI
stalked outside a rival, bid four wide into the lane, gained a slim lead past the three sixteenths, battled on while shifting in leaving mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly. WHERE'S EMMA rated close up while saving ground, slipped through to the inside of rivals to challenge in mid stretch then flattened out late.
TAKE A BREAK settled off the pace while saving ground, remained towards the inside through the drive and churned on. WARIDI CANDY rated between
foes while in range heading to the half, steadied briefly near the five sixteenths, eased out to make a run past mid stretch then flattened out.
ANGELOFCANTERBURY took over into the first turn then cleared, set the pace towards the inside, took pressure leaving the far turn, sparred inside rivals
into the lane, drifted out leaving the three sixteenths and weakened late. STRAND OF GOLD broke a bit slow, lost ground while three deep, advanced five
wide approaching the stretch, failed to kick on in mid stretch then faded. NUWANDA saved ground while not far back, eased out into the stretch, steadied
near mid stretch then came up empty. GRAMMY GIRL prompted the pace outside the leader, two wide bid into the far turn, dueled between runners nearing
the stretch then weakened leaving mid stretch. VICTORY BADGE settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out for the drive but lacked a bid.

Footnotes
SEARCH ENGINE , taken to the inner rail after sprinting clear entering the first turn, was pressed for six furlongs, opened up in upper stretch and
determinedly dug in late. ARMANDO R lacked speed, raced in the two path on the far turn, swung four wide at the head of the stretch and closed outside
the winner. IT'S VIPER , well positioned along the inner rail, eased out a bit in upper stretch and failed to rally. WISH FOR PEACE stayed along the inner
rail most of the race and was no factor. BRILLIANT ICE advanced three deep leaving the far turn and gave way. CASTLE ISLAND prompted the pace
outside the winner and faltered. MARTINI MARTIN , three wide the first turn, was in striking position in the two path entering the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
CELTIC CONTENDER pulled his way forward four wide outside rivals into the turn and prompted the pace, dropped in a path and bid in hand outside IRISH
HERO mid turn, sparred with that one from the quarter pole, responded to stout left handed asks to take command near mid stretch, shook clear leaving the
sixteenth pole while remaining under a stiff drive then extended his margin while taken in hand through the final yards. IRISH HERO vied two wide outside a
foe then briefly cleared into the turn, was joined from his outside mid turn, battled inside the winner past mid stretch, gave way grudgingly through the final
seventy yards and was clear for the place. FORCE OF JUSTICE vied inside early the rated back off the leaders entering the turn, tracked in hand mid turn,
swung out to take aim leaving the three sixteenths, chased but went evenly late. BOLT OF AURUM , between foes early, eased out under coaxing into the
turn, chased four wide into the stretch but came up empty. BUCKIN' DREAMER broke a step slow, lost ground four to five wide and faded. FROSTY THE
GIANT , three wide between foes early, pursued off the rail past the five sixteenths and weakened. GUARDIAN PRINCE broke inward, was corrected and
nudged forward to the inside of runners, steadied when shuffled back entering the turn then failed to get back on track.

Footnotes
RYE SMILE , snugly rated outside GRAUAILE around the turn and in upper stretch, took the lead near the eighth pole, was set down and held sway under
urging. GRANUAILE saved ground on the turn setting the pace, lost the advantage in mid stretch and continued gamely to hold the place. LEARNING TO
FLY hugged the inner rail throughout in an even effort. STEAM KNOT raced in the two path between horses around the course and finished willingly.
INCISIVE KITTEN , three wide on the turn, chased the pace and weakened. HEAVENLY CIELLA trailed and swung five wide turning for home.
