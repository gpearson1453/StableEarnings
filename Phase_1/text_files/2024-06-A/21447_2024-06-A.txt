no match for the winner late and held the place. SPAN OF CONTROL tracked the pace, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside
the leader into the stretch, then flattened the final sixteenth and held the show. ON AN ISLAND rated inside, saved ground through the turn, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch, angled in and was blocked, angled out and lost his path, then found room and could not gain. NEON DEION sprinted to a
clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong. YEAH TAKE THAT was never involved.

Footnotes
AWATEA set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. ST. SUSAN tracked the pace, saved ground
through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not match strides with that one, stayed on and held the place safe. OH MY
MIA allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick and held the show.
REIGERT GIRLS unhurried, looped five wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up for a share. THURSDAY GIRL rated close up, held
position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch and weakened. ELLE'S DANCER stalked the pace on the outside, lost
some ground on the two path through the turn, then faded into the stretch. TWISTED EMPRESS ran evenly for a half and had no rally. REINA RUANA was
a brief factor.

Footnotes
MR TITO'S well placed and off the rail, gained position on the two path through the second turn, gained a short lead into the stretch, dueled with ROUND
OF APPLAUSE in upper stretch and prevailed. ROUND OF APPLAUSE allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came four
wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, dueled with the winner and lacked the needed kick. SPETTACOLI (ARG) well placed, saved ground through the
turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and evened out and held the show. THALBERG never far back, moved
up three wide through the second turn, angled out in the stretch for clear racing room, closed willingly and missed the show. ORAZIO unhurried, looped up
three and four wide through the second turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. C THE KING broke awkwardly from the gate,
rushed up to position, then faded into the stretch. GALAXY BUILDER was a brief factor. BLOODPROF set the pace on the inside, drew off down the
backstretch, then faded through the second turn.
