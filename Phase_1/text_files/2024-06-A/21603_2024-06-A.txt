Footnotes
LILAC LACE was unprepared for the start, circled her field rapidly through the turn to make the lead in upper stretch, drifted to the seven path under left
handed urging, the rider switched to a right hand crop late and proved best while fully extended. OPULENT WAYS prompted the pace three wide and
finished second bests inside the winner. BLAZING ZENNA never far back, had a mild late rally four wide. IMMACULATE HEART pressed the pace along
the inside until deep stretch then faded. MAGICGIRL failed to respond. KRISTIN set a pressured pace two wide past the five sixteenth pole, had speed into
the stretch and gave way late. HASTY LADY wouldn't load in the gate and had brief speed. BLUE SAGE reluctant to load, was through early.
