SIPPING FIREWATER dueled inside of KANJENG for the lead soon after the start, battled on around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, tapped
once in the final furlong, widened to a clear advantage and finished ridden out. MIND YOUR MO broke in and bumped with rival at the start, raced in
contention sitting just off the top pair, roused three wide into the lane, steadily edged up closer and gained second best. KANJENG vied outside of SIPPING
FIREWATER soon after the start, battled on around the turn, could not match strides with eventual winner at the head of the lane but sustained a steady bid
and cleared the rest. NO RHYME OR REASON raced off the early pace, saved ground along the rail on the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and failed to
threaten. CRIMSON TAPESTRY broke in at the start, chased the top trio around the turn then weakened in the lane. GOTTA LOVE LIFE got bumped at the
start, lacked speed, raced in the back and failed to move into contention.

upper stretch, came under a ride, widened advantage and held late over fast gaining runner up. AL'S ROMEO bobbled at the start, then settled in the back,
picked up the pace and given cue four wide into upper stretch, responded willingly when called upon, rallied along the outside and ran out of time. VALE
was off a step slow at the start, then edged up to race three deep sitting just off the top pair, moved up to engage GOLDEN LUNA near the quarter pole,
could not move on with rival, but sustained a steady bid through the lane and cleared the rest. PAPA BILL was forwardly placed racing just off the
pacesetter, came under a ride two wide around the turn, failed to kick on and weakened in the lane. I'M AN OAK raced in contention along the inside, failed
to advance under pressure along the rail around the turn and gave way. BURN JAKEY BURN tracked the pace between rivals in a compact flight, hustled
along two wide around the turn but had no response and steadily faded.

Footnotes
NATUSIA vied outside of SHES SOLID SILVER up the backstretch, battled on around the turn, took a slim lead at the furlong marker then kicked clear.
SHE'S SOLID SILVER vied inside of NATUSIA in the opening quarter, continued to match strides around the turn, could not move on with eventual winner
past the eighth pole but kept on and finished clearly second best. SHESGOTSPIRIT tracked the early pace, came under a ride around the turn, ran on into
the lane under firm handling and cleared a share. R N B BABY raced in the back, swung wide into the lane and failed to threaten. NATIVE QUEEN raced in
range through early stages, flattened along the rail around the turn and continued to tire in the drive. CANADIAN JANE stumbled badly a step out of the
gate, lost the rider, ran loose in the race then got caught shortly after and walked off. STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY LOOKING AT THE START,
AFTER REVIERW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO
TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

Footnotes
OKIE CLIPPER steadied slightly along the inside heading into the first turn, continued forwardly placed racing just off the leader up the backstretch, moved
up to engage MAX'S MAP entering the far turn, battled for the lead into upper stretch, shook free and cleared command approaching the eighth pole and
finished going away. MAX'S MAP got bumped at the start, held a slim lead around the first turn then set the pace by a narrow margin up the backstretch,
took on the challenge of OKIE CLIPPER entering the final turn, fought back into stretch, then failed to be a match approaching the furlong marker and
settled for second best. IRISH RANSOM rated off the early pace, saved ground then picked up the tempo late on the turn, hustled along two wide into the
head of the lane, sustained a steady bid and finished clear for show. OUR HEAVENLY GIFT tracked the early pace, moved up into striking distance at the
quarter pole, flattened off the top pair turning for home and had no late response. EDGY LOVER raced in the back, hustled along two wide into stretch and
lacked a needed rally. I GOT A GUY rated off the early pace, urged for response around the turn and came up empty. DOUBLECHECK got bumped at the
start, lacked speed and failed to move into contention. LIGHT THE CODE was forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked up the backstretch then
weakened along the inside around the final turn.

Footnotes
LITTLEMORE TA KELA was allowed to settle in early stages and save ground, continued off the pace around the turn, tipped out four wide in upper stretch,
kicked in gamely and cleared late. SKALKAHO raced just off the leader in the opening quarter, briefly matched strides then edged back and angled to the
rail late on the far turn, cut the corner and roused forward to take a slim lead in upper stretch, dug in gamely fending off foes into the final furlong then got
worn down late. NATIVE HELLRAISER was reserved and trailed in the back, shifted out wide at the head of the lane and rallied gamely to capture show.
ANNUAL BUDGET tracked the early pace, crept up into striking range along the rail in the final sixteenth then yielded nearing the wire. MC COUGAR
stalked the early pace, hustled along three to four wide into striking range then lacked a closing kick. CINCO DE MO raced off the pace, came four paths
wide into upper stretch and showed response in final stages. SURPRISE ROAD TRIP chased in contention in the opening quarter, came five paths wide
into upper stretch and gave way. TAP ON BY raced in early contention then steadily weakened. SANGRIA SKY set the early pace, held clear around the
turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
DRILL'S LI'L MAN tracked along the outside, let out a notch and quickly advanced to take over the lead approaching the quarter pole, came three wide into
the lane, stayed sharp on top and finished going away. MYSTERY MAN raced in range through the early going, raced four paths wide at the head of the
lane, sustained a steady bid and prevailed for place. ROCK CITY ROCKET raced off the early pace, swung five wide into stretch and gained a share.
BROADWAY PETE raced near midpack saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide at the head of the lane, angled back to the rail and got edged for
show. HULEN vied for the lead up the backstretch, got collared by the winner nearing the quarter pole and flattened in the drive. ALL OVER OLIVER vied
for the lead up the backstretch, continued in striking range into the turn then came up empty near the past the quarter pole. CASH EXPRESS failed to move
into contention. SALTIE FIRE chased the early pace then steadily retreated. SCRUTINIZER turned head to the side in the gate and was declared a non
starter.
