Footnotes
H V XTRA WILD HEAT broke out leaving the starting gate, vied between horses early then settled off the pace around the turn, moved out to three wide in
upper stretch and fought gamely down the stretch to be up in the final jumps. DAY JO showed no early speed through the turn then moved out to four wide
in upper stretch and willingly made a late rally but was outkicked in the final yards to be second best. MEDAL OF HONOR shared the command from the
two path then edged away at the quarter pole but floated out entering the stretch and continued to drift out in the stretch, was collared in the final yards while
fighting gamely. FLYHERBFLYHIGH disliked the early going, trailed the field through the turn and passed tiring rival. ALL IN GOOD TIME shared the
command to the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
BOSTON PAULETTE settled off the pace while saving ground down the backstretch then angled out to three wide around the final turn and drove past the
leaders at the eighth pole to a clear easy lead and proved best. I DONT KNOW EITHER was allowed to settle on the inside down the backstretch then
moved out to two wide around the final turn then shifted in at the eighth pole and made a rail bid to be second best. SAVANNAH'S HERE prompted the
pace from two wide down the backstretch then moved up to engage the leader entering in final turn and took the lead midway through turn turn but was
overtaken in early stretch and kept on to hold the show. UNIFIED LOVE stalked the pace from three wide to midway through the final turn then engaged the
leaders and matched stride to early stretch and weakened. COMMUNICATIONISKEY sprinted to a clear lead for a half then was headed entering the final
turn and gave way. ZEEROCK trailed the field and was outrun.

INTO WISHING stalked the pace from two wide down the backstretch then moved up to engage the leader at the three furlong marker and edged away on
the turn and drew clear in the stretch. UNANIMOUSLY raced near the back from three wide, then moved out to four wide at the half mile marker while
moving up and made the rally from mid track in the stretch to be second best. WISE ANCHOR went to an unchallenged lead for the first half then was
headed near the three furlong marker and fought gamely around the final turn to be best of the rest. ZONG TOUGH has an awkward start then rushed up to
go between horses entering the first turn, settled in mid pack and tried to go between horses at the half mile marker while maintaining position around the
turn then shifted in at the eighth pole but had no late response. PINCH ME A PENNY was forwardly placed while saving ground to midway through the final
turn but dropped back and passed tired one in the stretch. HEZA PICKLE was unhurried and went four wide into the first turn and stayed in that path
throughout and was never a threat.

FRENCH FRANC (FR) tracked the leaders from two wide down the backstretch then moved up from three wide into the final turn and took command near
the top of the stretch and drew off. SWIZZLECITY was unhurried around the first turn then moved up from between horses going into the final turn and
made a late run to close well. PETULA went to the front to a pressured lead while matching strides inside of MY MY down the backstretch then edged away
on the final turn but was collared near the top of the stretch and was no match for the winner. ELMO'S SECRET saved ground through the final turn then
moved out to three wide at the eighth pole but failed to menace. MY MY stalked the pace from two wide around the first turn then matched strides outside of
PETULA down the backstretch and retreated. C C'S COWGIRL was allowed to settled around the first turn and down the backstretch then moved out to four
wide around the final turn but was never a threat.

upper stretch and closed willingly to be up in the final yards. CLEARLY CREEPS hustled to the front to a pressured pace, matched strides outside of INEZ
to midway down the backstretch then matched strides inside of CUPIE CUTIE to deep stretch but was outfinished by late closer. CUPIE CUTIE stalked the
pace from three wide to midway down the backstretch then matched strides outside out CLEARLY CREEPS to deep stretch and was outkicked in the final
yards. THE LADY BULLS EYE was unhurried around the first turn while racing three wide and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. QUITEGIRL broke outward
leaving the starting gate, raced four wide down the backstretch while making a middle move to be in contention but faltered. INEZ shared the command
inside of CLEARLY CREEPS around the first turn then vied for the lead down the backstretch and gave way.

Footnotes
SIGNING was allowed to settle around the first turn and down the backstretch, moved between horses at the three furlong marker, tipped out to three wide
through the turn to cruise past the leaders and held on for the win. MERRILY RUSH raced off the pace while saving ground through the final turn, tipped out
to two wide in upper stretch and made a run at the leader for the late gain. INDIAN SPIRIT went to the front to set the pace to midway through the final turn
and was overtaken, but kept on but was no match for the top two but proved to be best of the rest. CATCHYALATER pressed the pace from two wide to
midway through the final turn and tired. ADAMANTLY tracked the leaders from off the rail while racing in the middle of the pack but failed to menace.
BALITRIX was never in contention. SUENA was never involved.

KITIARA hustled to duel for the lead from the inside around the turn and pulled away at the top of the stretch to prove best. CHOCTAW BLESSINGS
bumped with LITTLE BURRITO and BITSY PERFECTMATCH leaving the starting gate then rushed up to duel three wide around the turn and fought
gamely down the stretch to be second best. JANIS pressed the pace and dueled for the lead from between horses around the turn, fought gamely down the
stretch and was outkicked in the final yards. BITSY PERFECTMATCH bumped with CHACTAW BLESSINGS at the start then settled off the pace while
racing four wide throughout and was best of the rest. LITTLE BURRITO bumped with CHACTAW BLESSINGS leaving the starting gate then tracked the
leaders while racing evenly. MISS IMELDA chased the leaders from the inside and was never a factor. SPECIAL GIRL was pinched back at the start, raced
four wide but was never involved.
