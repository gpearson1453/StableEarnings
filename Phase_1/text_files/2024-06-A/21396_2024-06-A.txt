Footnotes
MISS MIKOS chased the pace from two wide around the turn then engaged the leader entering the stretch, matched strides to deep stretch and cleared
late. LALY sprinted to a clear lead through the turn then was engaged by outside foe, battled down the stretch but couldn't fend and gave way grudgingly.
COME ON LADY stalked the pace from three wide, moved up on the turn but was no match for the top two. JOYZELLA raced near the back on the
backstretch then made a rail bid on the turn and kept on to improve position. I DID THE MATH showed no early speed, saved ground around the turn then
made a late stretch run to pass tiring rivals. IRISH SPARK was never a factor. LIONS LAW raced off the pace from off the rail to the turn and stopped.

MISS RIVER RAT battled for the early lead then settled off the pace and saved ground around the turn, moved up and split horses near the eighth pole and
drew off. REBA ATTACK pressed the pace from two wide to mid turn then took the lead but was outkicked by late closer. DEVIL went to a pressured lead to
mid turn then matched strides with outside rival to the top of the stretch and weakened. CLOEY ATTACK vied for the lead from three wide to mid turn but
lacked a late response. COWGIRL FRANKIE was tardy for the start and spotted the field many lengths, gained ground around the turn and passed tiring
rivals in the stretch. RUMBRANDT raced near the back down the backstretch then made a mild bid but was never a factor. BOYCE'S BANDITA stalked the
pace from four wide around the turn then floated out into the stretch and was done.

Footnotes
SAMARITA raced off the pace on the inside to the top of the turn, split horses in the final sixteenth during his late run and was up in the final jumps.
BEEHIVE raced off the pace from two wide, moved out to three wide on the turn while moving up, tipped out to four wide in upper stretch and showed a late
kick but just missed. DOROTHY CROWFOOT prompted the pace from the two path then took a brief lead in mid stretch but couldn't fend off the inside and
outside closers but fought gamely for the show. SECRET OPERATION showed no early speed, saved ground around the turn then angled out to five wide
in the stretch for a late rally but was too late. FRANKEL BABY rushed up to take the lead from under pressure by outside rival to the top of the stretch and
tired. FAST N HAPPY stalked the pace from four wide but lugged out on the turn and was not a factor. RAINY MOUNTAIN showed little.

Footnotes
DANVILLE stalked the pace from two wide down the backstretch then moved out to three wide for a bid on the final turn, tipping out to four wide in upper
stretch and drove past the leaders to prove best. JEFF THE LION raced near the back around the final turn then made a four wide bid in upper stretch for a
late rally to be up for the place. BRUCE BANNER pressed the pace from two wide to the top of the stretch and took a brief narrow lead but was no match for
the winner and tired. RED HORNET raced off the pace while saving ground and failed to menace. STORM'S REFLECTION roused to a pressured lead to
set most of the pace, was challenged in the early stretch but couldn't fend off the challenge and was empty. ROGUE ELEMENT was off a step slow, trailed
the field throughout and was outrun. PLACE PICK 8 - 1/2-1/2/7-6/7-3/5-4/5-2/6/8-5/12-2/3/5/7/9/10/11/12/13/14.
