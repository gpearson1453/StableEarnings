Footnotes
APOLLO RISING pursued from midpack in the three to four path around the first turn, bid outside of the leader and in the three path turning for home, drifted
out to the five path entering upper stretch, chased before forging an advantage leaving the furlong grounds and inched ahead. CAMP DADDY built a clear
margin in the two path entering the first turn, but got keen fighting rider's restraint around that bend culminating in a rank steady entering the backstretch,
settled into stride with five furlongs to go, met an outer challenge turning for home, maintained a margin through upper stretch, but drifted out at the furlong
grounds, got headed leaving that station, flopped back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole and fought on grudgingly. HUGE BIGLY laid off of the pace in the
four to five path early on, crept closer to striking range in the four path around the far turn, but chased the top pair while getting floated to the six path into
upper stretch, pursued them home and held show from an outer late bidder. NAVY SOUL broke a bit outwardly at the start, raced at the rear of the short
field along the inside, then in the two path around the far turn, swung out to the seven path entering the lane, but lacked the needed kick while running on
and missed reaching show late. HERCULES steadied to alter course outside of the leader entering the first turn, stalked in the three path before tucking to
the inside approaching the far turn, took aim inside of the leader approaching midstretch, but suffered an injury leaving the furlong grounds and was taken
off of the track in an equine ambulance. PER RULING ECM2024-201 FROM HIWU, HERCULES WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 5th TO UNPLACED DUE TO
A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
SANCTIFY stalked two wide, bid entering the lane, led in upper stretch and drove clear. MARINA GAMBA lugged in at the start, shifted out to the four path
while rating well back around the first turn, gained under rousing around the far turn, lugged inwardly continuing progress nearing the lane, brushed the
inner rail in upper stretch, straightened and tipped two wide at the furlong grounds, then gained place at the sixteenth pole. TONALITE laid off of the pace in
the two to three path, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, then stayed on to gain show in the final sixteenth. NOVARA pursued from midpack two
wide, awaited racing room behind foes turning for home, altered course from the three path to the eight path entering midstretch, and rallied belatedly to
reach fourth in the shadow of the wire. DREAM ON STORMY dictated terms via a loose advantage while under a snug hold around the first turn, met an
outer challenge entering the lane, got headed in upper stretch and weakened. MY SEXY BLONDE pursued from midpack three wide, chased tucking two
wide while between horses around the far turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane and lacked a bid. CARNANE (IRE) tracked along the inside, chased
around the far turn, shifted to the three path entering the lane and tired. TAP MY DESIRE broke poorly spotting the rest multiple lengths at the start, trailed
in the three to four path, improved in the three path around the far turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch and failed to factor. SEMANTICS tracked
three wide, crept into striking range entering the far turn, but tucked to the inside while chasing the top pair turning for home and weakened through the lane.
CHURNING BERNI pursued from midpack along the inside and faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
LADY JUNE gained from off of the pace in the four to five path around the turn, reached show tucking to the four path entering the lane, gained place before
shifting further in leaving the furlong grounds, sustained a bid inside of the drifting leader in the late stages and edged past. EVOCATION stalked two wide,
ranged up to gain control entering the lane, drove clear before drifting out at the furlong grounds, drifted back in as an inner rival threatened in the final
sixteenth and got bested late. NO CONSEQUENCES dropped back to trail soon after the start, advanced outside of rivals down the backstretch, tucked to
the three path to track into the turn, reached show while chasing turning for home, lost that position to an outer rival entering the lane, yet kept on to regain
show at the sixteenth pole. SILENT SECRETARY (BRZ) pursued from off of the pace in the three to four path and between horses around the turn, then ran
on evenly in pursuit. WHERE IS SHE set a clear pace down the backstretch, but was headed by an outer bidder entering the lane and weakened. BLUE
VORTEX tracked three wide before tucking to chase along the inside into the turn, but gave way turning for home. SALLY BALI pursued from midpack along
the inside, but was shuffled back behind rivals with three furlongs to go, shifted out to the three path turning for home, then to the five path entering the lane
but lacked a rally. LEGAL DECEIVER pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, but gave way around the turn. GATHER THE FACTS lagged
behind in the four path and got outrun.

Footnotes
SLANG vied two wide, forged an advantage as an outer rival joined the fray entering the lane, sparred gamely with that one through midstretch and repelled
her in the late stages. MURPHY GIRL stalked three wide, bid entering the lane, vied with an inner SLANG through midstretch but was turned away. MRS
WORLDWIDE exchanged bumps with an inner rival at the start, tracked the top trio from the three to four path, edged show in the five path at the furlong
grounds and was best of the rest. MINTY broke a step slow, lacked speed in the two path, then stayed on willingly. MISS ELLE veered out at the start, raced
off of the pace in the four to five path, drifted inwardly to the three path in upper stretch and failed to menace. AMERICAN WOMEN led narrowly while vying
inside of the eventual winner around the turn, but was headed by that one and a wider bidder entering the lane and weakened. BOWTIE OR NOTIE broke
slowly yet avoided contact from an inner rival by doing so, trailed in the three path and never got involved. DARE TO FLY traded blows with an outer rival at
the start, chased along the inside and faded nearing the lane.

TONY ANN dueled for the lead with an inner rival, forged a very narrow advantage nearing the lane, drifted out clinging to that advantage at the furlong
grounds, straightened shortly after to sustain the long battle through the late stages and prevailed. BEAUTY OF THE SEA dueled for the lead inside of the
eventual winner, got slightly headed approaching the lane, then gamely sustained the long battle through the lane but was grudgingly bested. MARISSA'S
LADY stalked along the inside, tipped to the two path entering the lane, edged show from an outer rival in upper stretch and chased the top pair home. JILL
JITTERBUG raced at the rear three wide, tucked into the turn, saved ground and improved inside of rivals. BLAME DAY pursued four wide, sustained chase
in the five to six path through the lane but failed to threaten. HIDEKI pressed outside of the embattled leading pair, failed to sustain pressure entering the
lane, lost show while chasing in the four to five path in upper stretch and yielded between horses. L J'S EMMA tracked two wide and between horses,
floated three wide into the lane and gave way.

UNDERHILL'S TAB broke a touch out at the start, tracked along the inside while a path off of the fence around the turn, shifted outside of the top pair
entering the lane, ranged up to bid at the furlong grounds sparking a duel, battled through the late stages and prevailed. BATON ROUGE vied with an inner
rival while taking the turn in the three path, led narrowly entering the lane, dug in to brace for an outer challenge in midstretch, sparred with that bidder
through the final furlong but was grudgingly bested. GOLD LUCK laid off of the pace in the two path, pursued in the three to four path around the turn,
shifted out to the six path entering upper stretch, rallied with a grinding charge to take aim on the dueling leaders with a sixteenth to go, but needed more
late. ABADIN led narrowly from an outer prompter while racing a path off of the inside around the turn, got headed by his outer counterpart entering the
lane, kept on through midstretch but faded through the final sixteenth. VINCO stalked the top pair from the four path, got floated to the five path entering
upper stretch where his rider lost his crop, then yielded between horses. BATTLEOFLEXINGTON raced at the rear in the four to five path before fanning to
the seven path into upper stretch, and got outrun.

Footnotes
LEBLON tracked two wide and between horses, tugged awkwardly steadying among foes around the first turn, pursued in the three path around the far turn
before tipping four wide entering the lane, rallied with a grinding charge to forge past the leader at the sixteenth pole, then held from a late outer challenger.
ATKINS laid off of the pace in the two to three path, inched closer in the four path around the far turn before fanning five wide entering the lane, sustained
progress through midstretch, but flopped back to his left lead while taking aim on the new leader with a sixteenth to go, closed in to offer a late bid but
missed. DOCTOR NASH pressed two wide, led between horses at the five sixteenths pole, drove clear in upper stretch, but was collared at the sixteenth
pole, flopped leads in the process and yielded. GREY STREAK stalked three wide, ranged up to the leaders around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with
an inner counterpart entering upper stretch and chased evenly thereafter. RACKATAPTAP laid off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the two
path and ran on between horses. ROYAL ACT broke a step slow, lacked speed along the inside, shifted out entering the backstretch, pursued in the three to
four path around the far turn and failed to menace. DREAMING OF SMARTY hopped slightly at the start, rushed forward to set the pace early on, got keen
from restraint around the first turn, settled into stride down the backstretch, but was headed while inside of a pair of rivals at the five sixteenths pole and
weakened. BOITANO stalked under a snug hold along the inside around the first turn, but came under a drive chasing turning for home and faded.
PINEDALE pursued from midpack in the three to two path then faded along teh inside turning for home. SANT' ANTIMO bobbled at the start, trailed in the
three to four paths and got outrun.

Footnotes
BRILLIANT BERTI steadied behind a rival settling in midpack along the inside around the first turn, advanced two wide and between horses turning for
home before tipping to the four path entering upper stretch, took aim on the leader shortly after, bid at the furlong grounds and drove past. FUNNYFLAME
stalked four to three wide and outside of the main group around the first turn, ranged up to bid three deep at the five sixteenths pole, led into the lane and
through upper stretch, but was confronted by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, dug in well but was bested. PURE POETRY tracked along the inside,
tipped three wide in upper stretch, edged show in the final sixteenth and held form an outer bidder. RAGUEL showed the way along the inside, got headed
by a pair of outer bidders at the five sixteenths pole, gave way clinging to show in the final furlong, but lost that position late and missed it in a photo. KID
CAIRO broke a beat slow, trailed in the two to three path, moved forward in the four path around the far turn before fanning to the six path entering upper
stretch, then ran on while widest to attempt a late bid for show, but missed at the wire. FORTUNE SELLER pressed three to two wide around the first turn,
bid along with an outer rival turning for home, but got outkicked by that one entering the lane and chased between horses through the final furlong. DEBT
PAID pursued from the three path and failed to menace. OSCAR'S WORLD tracked from midpack two wide, chased three wide around the far turn before
floating to the five path entering the lane, but faded between horses shortly after. BEAN MACHINE broke awkwardly, lacked speed two wide and made little
impact. CHAPERONE stuttered a step at the start, lacked speed along the inside and got outrun.

Footnotes
MR SCATTER broke a beat slow and was subtly put to tight quarters between horses at the start, trailed in the four to five path, advanced fanning to the six
path turning for home, rallied widest to reel in the tiring leaders in the late stages and drew clear as the rider stood in celebration. BRICKLAYER pursued
from the four to five path, stayed on while getting outkicked by an outer rival with a sixteenth to go and sustained progress to reach place in the shadow of
the wire. BOOKIE BRENT dueled with an outer rival, got headed by a wider bidder in midstretch, fought on and missed place at the wire.
OVERSTATEMENT stalked outside of the embattled leading pair, bid in upper stretch, led at the furlong grounds, but yielded between horses late. TRACK
LIGHT lacked speed along the inside, shifted to the four path entering the lane and moved up. STRASSE dueled for the lead two wide and faded between
