WHISPER'S MARK was taken back early to trail the field, circled the field and wore down his rivals to get up in the final strides. BEACH RUNNER was
steadied at the start, advanced inside to the turn, angled out, challenged three across, dueled through the stretch, was outclosed and earned place.
MAXIMUM BULL raced three across to the turn, vied to deep stretch, led late and yielded grudgingly. ROLL PENNY ROLL raced between horses to the
turn, vied to mid stretch, weakened under mild urging and faded from contention. JET SET WARRIOR failed to menace in an even effort. AARON WHO vied
to the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
NORTHERN QUEST settled off the pace, closed willingly and wore down SEXY DEXY to get up late. SEXY DEXY raced in hand early, set the pace while
racing well off the rail, drew off on the turn for a clear lead, tired in the drive and was caught late. ABSTRACT KAT lagged early in an outside trip and was
along for show in a steady effort. MY DAD IS THIRSTY settled off the pace, bid and came up empty. LUCK IN MY EYES raced mid pack in an even effort
and failed to threaten. DADDY WHAT IF raced in the back, lacked a response and was outrun. SWITCHERONIMO failed to contend.
