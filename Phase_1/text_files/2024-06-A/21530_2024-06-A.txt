Footnotes
GENERAL PARTNER raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the three path on the far turn, was
given his cue at the five-sixteenths pole, took over into upper stretch, shook clear with a furlong to run and drew away under steady urging. BLACK RAIN
was hustled to the front, raced inside on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path while inside of the winner on the far turn,
was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch and proved no match while able to get the place. ASSUME NOTHING was hustled
from the gate, raced in the two path on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, came under encouragement late on the backstretch, chased inside on
the far turn and tired while able to get the show. CLASSIC LEGACY went three then two wide on the first turn, settled behind horses on the backstretch, was
roused four then five wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. QUICK TO ACCUSE stumbled badly at the
start and was off a bit slow, angled in to save ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging with a half-mile to run, went around the
far turn in the two path and came up empty. SUERTE was hustled from the gate, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, chased four wide on
the far turn and capitulated. TOMMY TWO SOCKS lost his footing while away awkwardly and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, went two to
three wide on the turns at the rear and failed to respond.

two in the drive and lacked the needed kick. AWESOME NATIVE settled towards the rear, was roused two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into
the stretch and improved position. FULL SCREEN ran-off with the jockey on the backstretch during warm-up then was helped out by an outrider, was
forwardly placed on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and weakened.
THRILL OF IT broke out at the start, was coaxed along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LIFE
CHANGER settled at the rear on the outside, was roused in the four path on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, drifted in inside the three-sixteenths
pole, remained on his inside lead in the drive and was no factor. MANDATORY broke a step slow, settled toward the back, tugged some at the bit near the
nine-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond. KUPP was hustled from the gate then chased the pace, dropped back along the rail on
the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
BABY YODA coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace of GUN IT from the outside in the two path, got joined by ROTKNEE to his outside five furlongs from
home and applied pressure between foes coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, took over command and spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, drew off through to the finish. NINETYPRCENTMADDIE a bit unsettled prior to the start, got coaxed from the start and bobbled slightly just after the
break, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one
while running on to secure the place honors. GUN PILOT traded bumps early on four wide down the backstretch when jostling with ACCRETIVE to his
inside through to near the five-eighths, tucked briefly three wide before going to the two path through the turn, got placed to coaxing three furlongs out,
angled four to five wide into upper stretch and kept on through to the finish to procure the show honors. ROTKNEE coaxed from the gate, raced just off the
inside early on before gaining clearance to tip three wide near the five furlong marker, advanced on the top pair to prompt the swift pace latched on three
wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, tipped four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. TWENTY FOUR MAMBA grew
fractious in the gate prior to the start forcing the rider to eject briefly before remounting, chased just off the inside from the tail of the field, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. GUN IT hustled from the start, cut the pace under
pressure along the inside initially from BABY YODA to the outside and then that rival and ROTKNEE from the five furlong marker, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths under challenge, yielded the front taking the inside route into upper stretch and tired. ACCRETIVE traded bumps in the early going three
wide with GUN PILOT to his outside when jostling to keep his lane, tucked inside into the turn and came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, angled
three to four wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) was sent to the front, showed the way on the inside, responded well when asked outside the quarter-pole, dueled inside of TALK
OF THE NATION into the final sixteenth then got the best of that rival and prevailed under strong urging. MYSTERIOUS NIGHT (IRE) was well placed while
lightly rated on the inside, came under some encouragement late on the far turn, spun into the stretch in the two path, was kept in behind horses by CARL
SPACKLER in upper stretch, moved out for room inside the furlong marker and gained willingly late to just get the place. TALK OF THE NATION stalked the
pace on the outside in the two path, was asked while on near even terms for the lead at the quarter-pole, dueled outside of the winner into the final sixteenth
and was outfinished then lost the place while able to get the show. CASA CREED raced between horses while taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in
the two path, dropped back with about six furlongs to run, settled on the outside, was roused three then four wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive and lacked the needed kick. CARL SPACKLER (IRE) went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the far
turn, kept the runner-up in behind horses in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and also lacked the needed kick. KUBRICK (IRE) settled towards the
back on the inside, came out while roused at the quarter-pole, moved further out in the vicinity of the furlong marker and lacked the needed response.
LUCKY SCORE hit the outside of the gate but broke with the field, traveled around the opening bend in the two path, settled at the rear, fell well behind
while inside on the far turn and faltered.

CRUPI broke out a step at the start bumping BENDOOG, raced just off the inside through the first turn settling at the tail of the field, tipped three to four
paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to the wire. BENDOOG bumped at the start by the
aforementioned foe, raced three then two wide through the first turn before tipping four paths off the inside down the backstretch, advanced on the leader
near the half mile pole and steadily increased the pressure on that rival through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole and seizing command
spinning just off the inside at the head of the stretch, dug in under a drive inching away to the eighth pole, then fended off a pair of rivals through to the final
strides when overtaken late and was along for the place honors. MASQUEPARADE got brushed at the start by KUCHAR due to pressure from SIGNATOR,
chased along the inside early on through the opening bend and then chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four
wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to close outside but was ultimately fended off by the top pair while safely along for the show honors. TIME
FOR TROUBLE a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, raced just off the inside through the first turn before tipping five paths off the rail down the
backstretch, tucked three wide into the far turn and came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
running on to the finish but was outkicked in the late stages. KUCHAR got brushed at the start by SIGNATOR and in turn brushed MASQUEPARADE, came
under hustling and established the front to show the way in hand along the inside through the first turn and then just off the inside down the backstretch,
came under pressure from BENDOOG into the far turn now engaged in head to head combat through the bend and came under coaxing at the three-eighths
in response, yielded the front narrowly and took the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened in the late going. SIGNATOR bobbled at the break and
recovered outwards brushing KUCHAR who in turn brushed MASQUEPARADE, came under hustling and chased along the inside through the first turn and
then two to three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and weakened
in the final furlong. GOOD SKATE forwardly placed just off the inside through the first turn, raced three wide in closest aim of the leader down the
backstretch, retreated half a mile from home and backed away to the tail of the field under a light protective hold, got eased along and went four wide into
upper stretch, then got pulled up in the vicinity of the eighth pole and was transported by equine ambulance from the course.

RANDOMIZED came away in good order, moved out while in front early, raced in the two path on the first turn, showed the way off the rail on the
backstretch, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the far turn, responded well when asked in the three path at the quarter-pole, was placed
under a vigorous hand-ride under threat from the runner-up in upper stretch, responded gamely in the final furlong and just held under strong handling.
IDIOMATIC was unsettled at the start and broke about a length behind the top two but with most of the rest of the field, was caught in the four path on the
first turn, settled on the outside, ranged up five then four wide on the far turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, made an outside bid in upper stretch,
battled outside of the winner in the final furlong, reached even terms just before the finish but was denied while clear for the place. PRETTY MISCHIEVOUS
went around the first turn in the two path, was rated off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was given her cue near the five-sixteenths pole, drifted out
while chasing the leader in upper stretch, moved further out inside the furlong marker and tired but narrowly earned the show. RAGING SEA traveled three
wide on the first turn, settled on the outside at the back, was urged along late on the backstretch, went three wide for most of the far turn, shifted to the four
then five path late on that bend, chased outside into the final furlong and also tired then just missed the show. SOUL OF AN ANGEL broke a bit slow, was
reserved on the inside going around the first turn, settled on the backstretch, was roused while moving from the inside to the two path early on the far turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. TIZZY IN THE SKY broke hard through the front of the gate prior to the start then
was brought back around and reloaded, lunged while charging the front of the gate at the start but broke in front, raced in the three path on the first turn,
tracked the pace on the outside, chased four then three wide on the far turn and came up empty.

BOOK'EM DANNO away last despite no incidents, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn, came
under coaxing near the quarter pole and seized command straightened away swinging four wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth
pole, dug in under late threat from a pair of rivals and gamely fended them off to the finish. PRINCE OF MONACO broke out a step and was bumped solidly
by NUTELLA FELLA due to pressure from MAXIMUS MERIDIUS and was pinched back conceding about four lengths to the front before settling into stride,
chased four then three wide down the backstretch and into the far turn before tucking to the two path placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying willingly through the final furlong but was ultimately repelled to the wire. NUTELLA FELLA got bumped at the
start by the breaking inwards MAXIMUS MERIDIUS and in turn bumped the aforementioned foe solidly and pinched that rival out against REASONED
ANALYSIS, chased along the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs out, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and closed well through to the
finish to secure the show honors while well clear of the rest. REASONED ANALYSIS got bumped at the start by PRINCE OF MONACO and pinched that
foe back in tandem with NUTELLA FELLA, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took the
inside route into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. VALENTINE CANDY hustled from the gate, chased eight paths off the inside down the backstretch
heads apart with IMAGINATION before tucking four wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch
and improved position to the finish while making no true ground on the front. BE YOU broke out at the start and was corrected, chased six paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from midway, swung four wide at the head of the stretch and passed tired
rivals. IMAGINATION hustled from the gate, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch head to head with VALENTINE CANDY, tucked three
wide into the turn and came under urging with seven-sixteenths remaining, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. MAXIMUS
MERIDIUS broke in at the start bumping NUTELLA FELLA into PRINCE OF MONACO and in turn REASONED ANALYSIS and caused the pressure that
forced PRINCE OF MONACO to be pinched back and out between foes and for NASH to steady off the heels of NUTELLA FELLA when also squeezed
from his lane, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn and was ridden along from midway, took the
inside route into upper stretch and tired. NASH stumbled badly at the start and then got forced to check when squeezed out as MAXIMUS MERIDIUS broke
inwards bumping NUTELLA FELLA directly in front, got squeezed out and conceded five to six lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride,
chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into
upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. BARKSDALE hustled from the start, got rushed up to tackle the early leader and then dueled two to three
wide with FROST FREE to his outside through blistering splits, shook away briefly near the five furlong marker before coming under pressure into the turn
from that rival once more now tucked along the rail, came under a drive at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch in the midst of shaking off
his main pace rival and was overhauled by the eventual winner straightened away, then faltered through to the finish. FROST FREE led briefly early on
before dueling from the five path with the aforementioned foe to his inside, got shaken off a bit briefly midway down the backstretch before advancing once
more to press the issue now tucked to the two path through the turn, got ridden along with five-sixteenths to go and was shaken off just outside the quarter
pole, went four wide at that station, then gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
COGBURN bumped lightly with a foe at the start but broke in second position then went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the
two path on the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, was given one pop of a right-handed crop coming to the
sixteenth-pole then was eased up in the final strides while much the best. ARZAK moved out while off the pace, was roused two then three wide on the turn,
swung six wide into upper stretch and finished willingly to just get the place. STAR OF MYSTERY (GB) played up during the warm-up, was rated under
restraint, went two to three wide on the turn, raced between foes in upper stretch, chased the winner into the final sixteenth, fought between foes late and
just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. COPPOLA was hustled from the gate then well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn,
turned into the stretch in the two path, pursued the winner in the drive and just missed the trifecta. MISCHIEF MAGIC (IRE) lacked early speed while urged
along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch and improved position. DANCING BUCK was hustled from the gate,
settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed response. FILO DI ARIANNA (BRZ) settled near the middle of the field, was roused
four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. THIN WHITE DUKE lacked early speed then raced at the rear, rounded the turn in
the two path, came out into the stretch and failed to threaten. ALOGON tracked the pace on the outside, was asked three wide on the turn, spun four wide
into the stretch, bumped lightly with a foe near the furlong marker and weakened. BIG INVASION was hard held off the pace, tugged hard on the bit while
behind horses under heavy restraint in the vicinity of the half-mile pole, traveled around the turn in the two path, was asked three wide into the stretch,
encountered traffic outside the furlong marker then steadied while stymied from that point into the final sixteenth and lost any chance. SOSUA SUMMER
made light contact with a foe at the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn and tired. NO NAY METS (IRE) stumbled at the
start but broke with the rest of the field, settled towards the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
NATIONAL TREASURE coaxed from the gate directly to the front, went three then two wide through the first turn, cut the pace from the two path under
pressure from HOIST THE GOLD to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home and came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch set down for the drive, drew clear under a drive and was geared down to a light hand ride in the late stages. POST TIME just off the
inside through the opening bend, continued just off the inside throughout, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun from the two path into upper
stretch, proved no match for the top one, ran on to secure the place honors over a pair of rivals. HOIST THE GOLD coaxed from the start, went four wide
through the first turn, prompted the leader from the outside four then three wide through the first dog legged turn and down the backstretch before tucking to
the two path into the far turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish to preserve the
show honors. CASTLE CHAOS coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under prolonged coaxing from the half mile pole, cut the corner into upper
stretch, weakened in the late stages. WHITE ABARRIO four the three wide through the first bend, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing three
furlongs from home, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened in the stretch. BLAZING SEVENS three wide through the first turn, coaxed from the
start, three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide at the top of the stretch
and tired.

MEASURED TIME (GB) strode to the front while in hand early, gave up the advantage into the first turn, raced in the three path on that bend, stalked the
pace on the outside, took the lead before the three-eighths pole, shook clear in the two path on the far turn, came out four wide into upper stretch,
responded well into the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. NATIONS PRIDE (IRE) climbed off heels briefly while taken in hand early, went
three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer with five furlongs to run, was roused four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch,
pursued the winner in the drive and finished with good courage to just get the place. OHANA HONOR saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace,
came under urging in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong, moved in near the sixteenth-pole and
finished willingly to just miss the place while able to get a share of the show. FAR BRIDGE was hustled from the gate then taken in hand, traveled around
the first turn in the three path, was reserved off the pace, brushed with a foe late on the backstretch, moved closer in the two path on the far turn, was given
his cue at the quarter-pole, chased the winner in the stretch and just missed the place while able to get a share of third. PROGRAM TRADING (GB) was
taken in hand early, raced in the three path on the first turn, was rated off the pace, stalked the leader in the three path on the far turn, was asked near the
quarter-pole, chased in the stretch and just missed the superfecta. AL RIFFA (FR) was hustled from the gate, went around the opening bend in the two path,
settled off the pace, brushed with a foe under urging late on the backstretch, went three then four wide on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed kick. I'M VERY BUSY had his head-turned at the start and was last to commence, moved out early, rounded the first turn in the two path,
dropped to the rear near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground for most of the far turn then shifted three wide, was roused four wide into the stretch, moved out
near the sixteenth-pole then brushed with a foe and lacked the needed response. STRONG QUALITY took the lead into the first turn, went around that bend
in the two path, showed the way with company to his outside, lost the lead before the three-eighths pole, dropped back along the hedge on the far turn and
gave way.

Footnotes
DORNOCH coaxed from the gate to be forwardly placed from the start, went just off the inside through the first turn and prompted the leader from the
outside, tipped four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path with half a mile to run, came under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths, took over narrow command swinging three wide into upper stretch, got headed just inside the three-sixteenths by MINDFRAME, dug in
taking back the front just inside the eighth pole as his main danger wandered out shying under a left handed crop, then dug in gamely to the finish to fend off
that rival who was coming again at the end. MINDFRAME got bumped at the start by SIERRA LEONE who recovered outwards from a stumble, raced
forwardly placed four then three wide through the first turn before tipping five wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the far turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, seized command just inside the three-sixteenths narrowly, dug in and drifted out shying
under a left handed crop four to five paths just inside the eighth pole conceding the front to his main rival, got corrected near the sixteenth marker and came
again to latch on the aforementioned foe as they hit the wire. SIERRA LEONE stumbled at the start recovering outwards and bumping MINDFRAME,
ricocheted off that rival and bumped HONOR MARIE into PROTECTIVE pinching back that middle rival, raced three wide past the stands the initial time and
then just off the inside near the rear of the field through the first turn before tipping four wide down the backstretch, continued four wide through the far turn
and came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch as PROTECTIVE carried him out slightly from his inside, then
came in as ANTIQUARIAN drifted out under a left handed crop forcing PROTECTIVE to pause and take hold between then behind foes just inside the
three-sixteenths, kicked on belatedly to the finish to secure the show honors while clear of the rest. HONOR MARIE got bumped and pinched at the start by
SIERRA LEONE who bounced off MINDFRAME when recovering outwards from a stumble and in turn bumped PROTECTIVE, chased two to three wide
coming under prolonged coaxing from the half mile pole, continued two to three wide into upper stretch, brushed with ANTIQUARIAN when that one drifted
inward near the furlong marker but kept on willingly and improved position to the finish showing good courage. ANTIQUARIAN just off the inside through the
first turn, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, drifted out half a path just as
SIERRA LEONE came inwards just inside the three-sixteenths forcing PROTECTIVE to pause and take hold, came together with SIERRA LEONE a furlong
out, drifted inward thereafter brushing HONOR MARIE and weakened in the drive. PROTECTIVE got bumped at the start by HONOR MARIE after that foe
was bumped by SIERRA LEONE, chased just off the inside past the stands the first time before taking the rail through the first turn, tipped three then four
wide down the backstretch and got placed to coaxing at the half mile pole, moved in tandem with SIERRA LEONE through the far turn, went seven to eight
wide into upper stretch carrying that foe out slightly and then got forced to pause and got taken hold of just inside the three-sixteenths when ANTIQUARIAN
drifted out under a left handed crop and SIERRA LEONE came inwards, and weakened in the final furlong. SEIZE THE GREY coaxed from the gate,
established the front and showed the way in hand two then three wide under pressure from DORNOCH to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch displaced from command by his main pace foe, then tired through to the
finish. MYSTIK DAN chased along the inside, tipped out to the two path at the seven-sixteenths and came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
advanced mildly nearing the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then tired through to the end. THE WINE STEWARD just off the inside
in pursuit from mid pack through the first turn, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and through the far turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung four wide at the top of the stretch and gave way. RESILIENCE coaxed away from the start, chased just off the inside just off the pace,
tucked inside into the far turn and came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in retreat, faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
DOWNTOWN CHANNEL bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, drafted three wide while waiting behind foes
on the far turn, bumped with a rival while roused five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, drifted in while closing strongly late and got up
to prevail. NORTH END LADY pulled while keen under restraint early, went five then four wide on the first turn, contested the pace on the outside, shook
clear in the two path on the far turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was denied while able to get the place. AUTUMN
bumped with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, gained four wide on the far turn, chased into upper stretch, drifted in
outside the furlong marker, pursued the runner-up into the final sixteenth and willingly earned the show. IN ALL MY DREAMS was taken back early,
rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, moved from three to five wide on the far turn, was bumped six wide into the stretch and
improved for the last spot in the superfecta. BOBBY M'S GIRL went three then two wide on the first turn, dropped back late on that bend, settled off the
pace, negotiated traffic while inside to the two path on the far turn, came between horses in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. LADY LAOBAN
showed speed between foes in the two path, dropped back on the first turn, settled off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and weakened. ALETTE
D'ORO settled towards the back on the inside, saved ground through the far turn and failed to rally. TOP OF THE TABLE showed speed between horses,
went four then three wide on the first turn, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, dropped back along the hedge on the far turn and tired. SPLASHY
stumbled at the start, showed speed on the inside of four opponents, raced inside for most of the first turn then dropped back while moving to the two path,
settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the far turn, raced between foes passing the five-sixteenths and also lacked the needed response. ASSISI
was hustled from the gate, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, raced in traffic in the two path on the far turn, steadied near the five-sixteenths
pole and lacked the needed response. PRACTICAL ROYALTY broke in at the start and was last away, saved ground on the first turn, came off the hedge
late on that bend, settled at the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch and was no factor.
