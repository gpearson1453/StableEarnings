Footnotes
BAIL OUT stalked the pace inside horses down the backstretch and into the stretch, eased outside in upper stretch, took command inside the eighth pole
and edged away. THATAWAY remained along the inner rail, disputed the pace to mid stretch and faded late. MICROPHONE (IRE) , rank behind horses the
first turn, rated down the backstretch, swung outside in upper stretch and rallied. BEE MAJOR disputed the pace outside THATAWAY and weakened the
final furlong. CLASS WIZARD chased the pace outside horses to mid stretch and weakened late. BOFFO KID lacked speed, raced inside horses into the far
turn, swung three wide leaving the bend and passed tired horses. SUPER E saved ground the far turn, stayed along the inner rail in the stretch and failed to
menace. MARYLAND MOON , three wide the first turn, was well positioned into the far turn and faltered in upper stretch. PRINCE OF PORTLAND , four
wide the first turn, was not a factor. ROCKLAND EXPRESS gave way on the far turn. LANGLEE AVENUE was outrun.

OVERLY DRAMATIC snugly rated three wide in close attendance, bid to apply pressure mid turn, gained a slim lead between runners nearing the lane, dug
in tenaciously under solid handling past mid stretch and kept BUCKIN' GREAT at bay. BUCKIN' GREAT had speed then eased back off the leaders after
about a furlong, angled out near the three eighths then ranged up to threaten three deep into the lane, wandered outward when battling outside the winner
past mid stretch, corrected and continued gamely to the wire. SUSAN'S MULE took over between runners early, spurted clear into the turn then dropped in
to secure the rai, set a rated pace around the turn, ceded the lead with about a quarter mile remaining then gave way grudgingly through the final furlong.
PLAY GOOD PAY GOOD broke a step slow, rushed up inside foes soon after to briefly contest the pace, eased back into the turn then stalked, was under a
ride mid turn, angled out nearing the stretch then faded. SUPER SIMPLIFY broke outward and was off a bit slow, raced off the pace and off the rail then
gave way through the final three sixteenths of a mile.

Footnotes
GREAT KISSER accelerated to the early lead, controlled the pace slightly off the rail and was kept to his business in the drive. WATCH OUT WORLD ,
pinched back after breaking in the air, was snugly in hand when eager to run leaving the backstretch, steadied lacking room in upper stretch, altered course
to the five path in mid stretch and closed gamely. MILE HIGH MIRACLE , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, flattened out. CORRECTED
PEDIGREE , outside the winner around the turn, chased him to mid stretch then weakened. CONTRIVANCE raced well off the inner rail on the turn and
failed to rally. SIR PALACE PRINCE bore out sharply leaving the starting gate, stayed along the inner rail most of the trip and was no factor. COUSIN
GIORGOS , three wide on the turn, was not a factor. MOONFLYER , steadied in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail on the turn
and was no factor. ROCKY'S ADVENTURE , wide on the turn, was outrun. MILO trailed.

EXIT RIGHT , forwardly placed in the two path and under a light hold, moved up between runners approaching the quarter pole, dropped in towards the rail
and responded to strong asking soon into the lane, wrested command from NAKED AND FAMOUS with about a sixteenth remaining, kept on under a
vigorous hand ride and held firm. NAKED AND FAMOUS prompted the pace two wide, moved in hand to engage the leader near the three eighths, edged
clear into the lane then came under a ride soon after, dug in when confronted from his inside in mid stretch, ceded command a sixteenth out then kept on
gamely to the wire. FUN LOVIN CRIMINAL , off the pace and under some coaxing, quickly gained three wide leaving the far turn, forced the issue into the
lane, saw the top pair get away in mid stretch while on his left lead then went evenly late. NIFTY , off a beat slow, raced three wide around the first turn,
dropped in for the backstretch run, edged up near the half, eased back out under pressure in the lane and churned on. TOAST TO COAST , three wide
stalking outside a rival, failed to go on under pressure leaving the three eighths, remained wide for the drive and faded. GUAPONESS cleared early, set the
pace towards the inner rail, was taken on leaving the far turn, failed to go on entering the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
WHENIGETTOHEAVEN saved ground on the turn stalking the duel, eased outside in upper stretch, swept to command approaching the eighth pole and
drew off under urging. HAD TO HAVE HIM lacked speed, was three deep leaving the turn, floated further out in upper stretch and rallied. STORM THE
COURT stayed along the inner rail on the turn, was well placed in mid stretch and flattened out. KANTHARI dueled outside THAT'S RIGHT and gave way
the final furlong. THAT'S RIGHT saved ground around the turn disputing the pace and gave way the final furlong. GRATEFUL BRED , steadied then
checked in tight quarters about a furlong after the start, was no factor. DR OSERAN , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. ROCK THE
BOAT dropped back through the stretch and was eased late.

Footnotes
INDIAN LAKE dropped off the early pace then was coaxed along between rivals near the half, eased out to advance four wide under a ride into the lane,
awaited room leaving the three sixteenths, dove towards the inner rail, closed determinedly under left handed pressure and got up in the final jumps.
ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE grabbed command in the opening furlong and set a rated pace towards the inside, took pressure leaving the far turn then spurted
clear while remaining under some rating into the lane, spurted away under a drive leaving the three sixteenths, wandered out a bit then gave way grudgingly
through the final yards. MAGICNTHEMOONLIGHT hit the outer portion of his stall at the break then bobbled, quickly regrouped and prompted the pace
outside the leader, stayed around while under pressure as the leader got away past the three sixteenths, found more through the final sixteenth and came
back on between rivals in gritty fashion. CATAHOULA MOON edged up early and stalked three wide, gave chase into the stretch, switched over to his
correct lead inside the sixteenth pole and kept on grinding between runners. NO EASY DAYS , four to five wide, ranged up into the lane, pursued outside
runners past mid stretch but was out kicked. NORTH HIGHLAND drifted in at the start and brushed with a rival, lagged off the pace, raced off the inside in
upper stretch then had some belated action. MINISTER FOR MAGIC had speed between foes then dropped in to chase, stayed on to about the quarter pole
then faded. SUPREME LAW , brushed at the break, moved up between runners early, saved ground mid turn then came up empty. HELDISH failed to
menace. PER RULING 24-086 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, ARDEN'SLUCKEYTOBE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO
UNPLACED DUE TO A MEDICATION VIOLATION.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF THE DANCE , three wide the first turn, raced between horses leaving the backstretch, came into the stretch three wide, took the lead in upper
stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole and pulled away under encouragement. SUMMER ICE broke alertly, stalked the pace racing along the inner rail,
eased out in upper stretch and rallied. LEM ME DRINK , taken up when shuffled back approaching the first turn, steadied in close quarters entering the
backstretch, worked between horses the far turn, angled wide in upper stretch and rallied. LORRAINE'S WAY lacked speed, raced inside horses to the
stretch, swung out, steadied on the heels of a rival near the eighth pole and finished willingly. EXTRA DIRTY chased the pace, advanced in the two path
leaving the far turn to challenge for the lead and gave way in the drive. LUCKY HONEY drifted in approaching the first turn, trailed to the stretch then passed
tired rivals. GANBATTE remained along the inner rail for much of the trip and failed to rally. COTINGA lacked speed and was steadied behind several
horses approaching the stretch. LIFE AT BOTH ENDS sprinted clear soon after the break, was steered to the inner rail approaching the first turn, set the
pace along the rail to the stretch then faltered. TIA MAYIN rushed up four wide entering the backstretch, chased the pace to the far turn and faltered.
