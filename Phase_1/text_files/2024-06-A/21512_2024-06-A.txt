GREER CROSSING broke slowly and inward, advanced along the rail, waited for room through the bend, got through along the rail leaving the
three-sixteenths marker, her rider lost his crop shortly after that, battled on even terms with WILDWOOD GHALY inside the last furlong and edged ahead
inside the final sixteenth. WILDWOOD GHALY shuffled back from tight quarters after the first eighth, progressed two wide on the bend, fanned outside
HALLIE'S RAINBOW entering the lane, fought for the lead inside the last eighth but did not have enough left in the waning yards. HALLIE'S RAINBOW vied
for the early lead while just off the inside, edged ahead on the turn then gradually wore down inside the final furlong. SERENDIPITY COCO prominent
toward the outside, did not keep up three wide on the bend, swung out further for the stretch run and had no late bid. BLUE EVEN SCORE failed to menace
running widest. LORI ATTACK displayed early speed between rivals, retreated two wide on the turn then gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
BAM BAM CAM brushed with CALL ME DROSSEL at the break, stalked the early speed from path three, commenced his bid on the turn, had the
advantage into the lane, drew clear, took the rail, lengthened command the last eighth and maintained full control. FRONTANA advanced from inside on the
bend, angled out when he took over second nearing the sixteenth marker then drifted out in the waning yards as he closed the gap some on the leader.
CALL ME DROSSEL bumped and forced in some just after the start, edged ahead for the lead, saved ground, floated out some entering the stretch and
flattened. WILLOW RIDGE broke alertly but soon dropped back and moved toward the inside, was just off the rail on the bend, fanned out some for the drive
and lacked a stretch rally. AFRICAN WARRIOR was forced in then slammed between rivals, checked and failed to menace in a wide trip. MADE TO FIT
bore in at the break, forced AFRICAN WARRIOR inward then bumped solidly with that one, quickly recovered to press the early speed from just outside but
began to yield two wide on the turn. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start and the rider of AFRICAN WARRIOR lodged an objection alleging
interference from MADE TO FIT and CALL ME DROSSEL. After their review, the stewards did not change the official order of finish as MADE TO FIT, who
finished behind AFRICAN WARRIOR, was the initiator of the interference.

GHAALEB'S HONOR rated off the early speed, went for the lead leaving the bend, rallied from path three, took over inside the furlong marker, opened up
and maintained full control. FROSTED ECLAIR quickly drew away from the rest at the start, showed the way just off or along the rail, was no match for the
GHAALEB'S HONOR in the lane but stayed clear for the place. BE MY BESTIE raced in contention along the rail, loomed a serious threat with a furlong left
but leveled off instead. MYSWEETANNALYZE void of speed from inside, gradually angled out through the bend, lost ground widest into the stretch, lodged
a mild bid and narrowly missed third. GHAALEB'S RANGER soon trailed, chased from just off the inside, angled to the outside upper stretch and lacked a
significant response. BALI DREAMIN made a small leap from the gate, reached contention just off the inside on the turn but gave way for the drive.
TALKTOMEJUSTICE was a contender toward the outside for five furlongs, sustained an injury inside the furlong marker, was pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
ARROW STRIKE well placed from inside, lost his path leaving the second bend, altered out some at the top of the stretch, altered out four wide with a
furlong to go, engaged the leaders with a sixteenth left and edged ahead in time. IRISH DECLARATION settled early, moved out widest midway on the
backstretch, vied for the lead four wide on the second turn, angled in some leaving that bend, was bumped by RUNNINGFORCASH dueled outside the
latter through the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. RUNNINGFORCASH pressed the early speed from outside, went for the lead between rivals
on the second bend, floated out a bit entering the stretch, bumped IRISH DECLARATION, fought gamely to the wire, did not have enough left but was
clearly best of the others. YOU'RE IN COREY was sent to be an early contender just off the rail, angled out widest into the second turn, failed to stay close
and only passed tired ones the last eighth. EVERLOVINGHAND set a pressured pace just off the rail, lost the advantage on the second turn, took the rail
entering the lane, gave way the final furlong and was drifting out late. CHEEKERS was hustled to be prominent just outside EVERLOVING HAND, began to
yield before finishing five furlongs, angled out four wide on the second bend and had no stretch bid. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS failed to menace in a
ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
DANZA TAXI shared the lead from just off or along the rail then edged ahead inside the last furlong. LAKE MILLS vied for the lead just outside DANZA TAXI
from the early going, moved ahead upper stretch, did not have enough left inside the final eighth but was easily second best. JACK SPRAT pressed the
pacesetters from outside, was three wide taking the bend, was no match for the top pair when set down for the drive, drifted out under left-handed pressure
just after entering the last eighth, lugged in late but lasted for the show. ST. LOUIE LOUIE unruly in the gate, was hustled along to be a factor from inside,
did not stay close through the turn, angled out four wide at the top of the lane, brushed with LAYTON THE DAY inside the final furlong, altered out some to
stay clear of JACK SPRAT and finished evenly. SCHMOOZIN hesitated at the break and was not a factor in a wide trip. LAYTON THE DAY was also a
contender while off the rail on the backstretch, improved position two wide on the bend, lost ground fanning to path five for the drive, angled in some as ST.
LOUIE LOUIE came out midstretch, was forced out a bit as JACK SPRAT came out inside the final eighth and also finished evenly. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN
fractious in the gate, was a brief factor but faded along the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
ONE WAY HOME vied for the lead between horses from the beginning, was two wide through the bend, moved clear leaving the turn, drifted out deep
stretch but held on. ALYANAABI rated from outside, lost ground five wide taking the turn, angled in entering the lane, rallied, altered out some as ONE WAY
HOME came out deep stretch, came up short but was easily second best. SIRCORRI disputed the pace just outside ONE WAY HOME for a half mile, came
three wide into the stretch, was no match for the top pair but maintained his position. GINSBURNED displayed early speed just inside ONE WAY HOME,
began to yield along the rail on the turn and flattened for the drive. R H SMOAKEM gradually angled in while just behind the early speed on the backstretch
then faded two wide nearing the end of a mile half. SUPER SILVER was prominent along the rail in the early going but began to yield after three furlongs.
ROAD GAME raced in contention toward the outside, was four wide taking the turn then gave way the final quarter mile.
