Footnotes
SWEET LAURA was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved ground entering the first turn, edged closer and got in tight past the mid-way point on the
turn, steadied then angled out a couple paths, remained nicely rated into the backstretch then steadily began to inch up closer, moved up three wide to
engage top duo mid-way around the far turn, dueled three deep into stretch run, was ridden along under a strong hand ride then came under right handed
encouragement, dug in gamely under firm handling and got a head up on the wire. DO YOU BILEVE sped to the lead soon after the start and widened
advantage around the first, continued to lead the way up the backstretch, took on the challenge from outside duo mid-way around the far turn, dueled inside
of rivals into the lane, battled on gamely on the rail and got outnodded in final stride. LORRAINE'S LEGACY stalked the pacesetter around the first turn and
edged closer late on the backstretch, moved up to challenge DO YOU BILEVE approaching the mid-way point on the final turn then took on the added
challenge of outside running SWEET LAURA, vied for command racing between foes into the lane, fought on gamely but lacked a final kick to get by late.
OH NIKI was the closest pursuer of the clear leader around the first turn, lost position in upper stretch, weakened entering the far turn and continued to tire
in the drive. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

FLOWERSFORSHANTELL was allowed to settle and save ground around the first turn, edged up closer late on the backstretch, launched a three bid near
the quarter pole, sustained bid for INDY AGAIN into the lane, dug in gamely under firm handling and got up in final stride. INDY AGAIN tugged under slight
restraint to engage rival for the lead around the first turn, held a slim lead then edged away and held clear still in hand around the far turn, saved ground
entering the lane and roused for more, kept clear a furlong out then got caught in final stride. JERI DAWN was well reserved and trailed up the backstretch,
picked up the tempo along the inside around the far turn, angled out three to four wide at the head of the lane, sustained a steady bid and finished well clear
for show. MOCHA KISS vied for the lead around the first turn and past the half mile marker, then raced just off the leader and tracked rival into the turn,
launched a two wide bid near the quarter pole, came two wide into upper stretch and steadily faded. SHE'S A BIG STAR was forwardly placed through early

FIREBAUGH set a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead around the turn, dug in gamely and shook free top of the lane, continued to fight off
HARD SPIRITS down the lane and held firm. HARD SPIRITS tracked the pace through early stages, loomed a threat three wide at the quarter pole,
sustained bid into the lane, stayed on with good response but could not reach the winner and settled for clearly second best. GARBO SPEAKS pressed the
pace up the backstretch, vied with the eventual winner around the turn then weakened to show. SWEET STROLL was off a step slow at the star, moved up
and raced in range mid-way up the backstretch, was ridden along the rail around the turn, ran on into upper stretch then gave way. RISKY WHISKY raced in
the last flight through early stages, hustled along two wide around the turn and into upper stretch but failed to kick on. KID BIZ raced in the last flight, urged
inside around the turn and failed to move into contention. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING

Footnotes
FIRE BRYAN tracked the pace through early stages, picked up the pace past the half mile marker, vied with PROMISE CODE around the far turn, shook
free to a slim lead turning for home, continued to fend off foes gamely down the lane and held firm. GREY STORM rated off the early pace, edged up closer
late on the backstretch, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, sustained outside bid into the lane, dug in under firm handling but could not get to
the winner. RONIC saved ground around the first turn and into the backstretch while rated off the front runners, angled out and headed in pursuit three
furlongs from home, hustled along three wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and secured a share. COMMANDER REX cleared the lead going around
the first turn and continued to set the pace up the backstretch, got collared for command with three furlongs left to run, ran on along the rail through the turn,
lodged a game rebid along the inside at the head of the lane, moved back into threatening position then evened late. PROMISE CODE tracked the leader
up the backstretch, vied with then eventual winner around the final turn then weakened in the lane. SMACKZILLA showed response in early stages then
retreated after a half. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
STAR OF MINE raced in range along the inside up the backstretch, edged up closer along the rail and lacked a clear path late on the turn, got clear entering
the top of the lane, roused forward to a slim lead and kept on gamely to prevail. ROWDY RAY tracked the early pace, made a move at the quarter pole,
sustained a bid four paths wide into stretch run, edged into striking distance in the final sixteenth then yielded late. A BRUSH OF LUCK was forwardly
placed from the onset, hustled up three wide in close range around the turn, sustained bid to the furlong marker then flattened out. HOOKED ON DREAMS
set the pace through the backstretch, held firm around the turn, got collared at the head of the lane and gave way past the eighth pole. I LOVE
ROCKNSTROLL was unhurried and raced in the back, swung five wide into the stretch run and lacked a needed rally. PAPA JOJO raced in range two wide
in the opening quarter, then weakened mid-way around the turn. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED
USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.
