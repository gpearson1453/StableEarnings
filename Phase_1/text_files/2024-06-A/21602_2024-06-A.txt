Footnotes
TIZ HAPPY prompted the pace from outside, fought two wide to the stretch, dug in the last sixteenth and edged the runner-up. DR RUBEN M showed the
way up the backstretch with TIZ HAPPY to the outside, maintained command along the rail through the bend, resisted through the lane but yielded
grudgingly in the end. PAVEL'S ETOILE stalked the top pair from off the rail, rounded the bend three then two wide, continued within range with a furlong
remaining but failed to produce a bid. EL ONDEADO stalked the leading pace from inside, cut the corner into the lane and weakened. SNOWDONIA broke
a step slow, coaxed along early outside a rival at the back, got move out to the three path briefly midway around the bend then came back to the two path
approaching the stretch and lacked further response. PANUCO brushed by outer rival and coaxed from the gate, paused and was ridden cautiously along
the inside early and dropped back off the pace in the early going, chased two wide then along the rail on the turn and failed to menace. WATCH THE LAW
broke in and brushed with PANUCO, chased at the back inside a rival, saved ground through the turn and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
THIS IS A JOKE dueled from outside, inched ahead at the three-eighths pole, put away inner rival midway around the bend and maintained a comfortable
advantage under urging to the line. STREET TALKER lacked early speed then made progress from inside up the backstretch, drew closer while shifted out
to the two path around the bend, tipped out at the top of the lane, finished willingly for second but could not threaten the winner. OCASEK stalked the top
pair to the turn, took aim in the three path a quarter mile out but weakened in the final furlong. THUNDER BALL dueled inside THIS IS A JOKE to the turn,
asked keep up with three furlongs left to run, lost touch with the winner past the five-sixteenths pole and faded in the drive. TAPIT DOWN coaxed along
chasing out of range then trailed past the half-mile pole, rounded the bend two to three wide and lacked the needed response when called on.

GIVE ME THE LUTE bumped with IRISH ROYALTY at the start, showed speed between rivals then ceded command and took a stalking position along the
inside, saved ground through the turn, launched a rail bid from the fence, took over midstretch and held over a late comeback from the runner-up. PROOF
HE RIDES pressed four then three deep in the early stages, challenged three deep through the turn, gained command entering the lane, inched ahead in
upper stretch, lost command outside the sixteenth pole, dug in late and missed. CANE CREEK ROAD broke through the gate prior to the start, settled at the
back, roused three wide on the turn, angled out widest in the lane, summoned a mild rally but lacked the needed late punch. PLEASE FOCUS vied for the
lead inside rivals up the backstretch and around the turn, lost command entering the lane, fought to midstretch and weakened in the late stages. IRISH
ROYALTY bumped leaving the gate, got crowded between rivals early, tracked off the rail, rounded the bend in the two path, steered out in upper stretch
and weakened. BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) vied three deep then between rivals on the backstretch, fought two wide between around the bend to the top
of the stretch, then faded out of contention.

DEMOTIVATE brushed leaving the gate, trailed briefly then advanced three and four wide on the first turn, challenged for command from outside past the
nine-sixteenths pole, battled two wide through the second bend, put away inner rival in upper stretch stretch while being confronted by CITADINO to the
outside, dug in gamely in deep stretch and held the runner-up at bay. CITADINO raced in range between rivals, came under coaxing dropping off the pace
in the middle stages, angled in on the second bend and was on the move, steered back out at the quarter pole, took aim three wide into the stretch,
challenged DEMOTIVATE with a furlong left to run and could not get by. LUTHER PASS went up to duel from inside early, inched ahead early on the
backstretch, cleared STRIKING THUDER but had to contend with DEMOTIVATE, fought inside that rival through the far turn, yielded in upper stretch and
flattened to third. TOPPERS WAGER stalked from inside, came out on the far turn, went three to four wide into the stretch and weakened. SPEED OF THE
NILE rank in the early then began to pull chasing two wide before moving inside, continued to tug along early on the backstretch, raced well off the pace
three wide into the far turn, angled down to the inside to save ground and improved position in the lane. RINGTONE chased five then four wide on the
clubhouse turn, pressed three deep briefly between rivals early on the backstretch, chased the leaders past the halfway marker, went three deep into the far
turn, entered the stretch four wide, had the rider lose the crop outside the eighth pole and had little left when called upon. BRAINIAC stalked three wide into
the first turn then had to steady off heels leaving the bend, chased five wide on the far turn and could not make an impact. STRIKING THUNDER dueled
from outside around the clubhouse turn, pressed the pace early on the backstretch before dropping back off the pace, lost more ground n the far turn, in the
three path and tired down the lane. DAPITAN STAR brushed with the winner leaving the gate, tucked inside at the back and never got involved.

ISCREAMUSCREAM tracked two wide into the turn, drew close and loomed three wide into the lane, took over in upper stretch, cleared at the eight pole
and won going away while drifting to the inside. RASCALITY settled off the rail, chased two wide through the turn, angled out in the lane and bested the
rest. SHAMROCKIN lacked early speed and lagged behind, trailed from the rail through the turn, swung out into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and got
up for third. ESPRIT ENCHANTE got put in a bit tight between rivals and was taken back then climbed across the dirt, chased two then three wide on the
turn, tipped out into the lane and got edged for third. SOHO stalked the top pair from inside, saved ground through the turn, lacked room and steadied
behind GIRL OF MY DREAMS in upper stretch, stayed on the fence but could not recover. GIRL OF MY DREAMS got bumped leaving the gate, went up to
take control from inside, challenged by APRIL VINTAGE around the turn, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. APRIL VINTAGE off alertly from
outside then ceded command to GIRL OF MY DREAMS, raced up close outside that rival to the turn, challenged around the bend, fought between rivals in
upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. ELEGANT shifted in and bumped rival leaving the gate, settled inside, drew closer around the turn, tipped
out at the top of the stretch and flattened out.

NOONI made light contact with SHE'S MY FLAME at the start before clearing quickly, padded the lead through the turn along the rail, then widened further
without being asked and coasted to the wire. SHE'S MY FLAME brushed lightly by NOONI while being hustled from the gate and chased off the rail, went
two wide into the turn then angled to the inside, kept trying from the fence down the lane and gained second while failing to make headway on the runaway
winner. LEE'S BABY GIRL reluctant to load into the starting gate, coaxed early outside rivals, chased three wide outside CLAPPING TREES around the
bend and was outfinished for the place honors. CLAPPING TREES chased two wide into the turn, was closest in pursuit still a bit off the rail entering the
drive and weakened. PRETTY CECY trailed off the rail then outside a rival leaving the backstretch, took the turn four wide, spun five wide into the lane,
eased in the stretch and walked off.

FAST GISELLE settled inside, gained along the rail around the bend, tipped out and bid three deep at the eighth pole, took over approaching the sixteenth
marker and drove clear. PINK ACE took control from inside and showed the way early with CHAMPAGNE CAMIE to the outside, cleared that rival nearing
the half-mile pole, showed the way to the stretch from the rail, challenged from outside at the eighth pole, yielded to the winner a sixteenth out and held the
place. STRIKINGLY got knocked into inner rival in the beginning, traveled near the back inside a rial, saved ground on the turn then tipped out approaching
the stretch, altered out a bit from behind CHAMPAGNE CAMIE and got up for third. CHAMPAGNE CAMIE pressed the pace for a bit then chased up the
backstretch, remained closest in pursuit two wide through the turn, put in a mild bid with a furlong left to run but was no match in deep stretch. QUARIA
THUNDER broke in and bumped STRIKINGLY, trailed in the early going, took the turn two wide and kept trying to the wire. HEADED FOR OM stalked out
of range in the early going, rounded the bend two wide, moved out at the top of the stretch and weakened. SMART KITTEN bumped leaving the gate, raced
outside a rival towards the rear, took the turn two to three wide, moved out at the top of the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
O MANDY vied between rivals then pressed from outside up the backstretch, took over past the five-sixteenths pole, carried a short lead into the final
sixteenth and drew clear. WILLOW COVE vied for the lead inside rivals then inched ahead, lost command midway around the bend, fought back along the
rail into the stretch, stayed on to the sixteenth pole, then lost touch with the winner but was clearly second best. BETTY PACK chased from off the pace on
the inside, gained along the rail then tipped two wide at the quarter pole, got to within striking distance at the top of the stretch but could not find more in the
final furlong. PLAY MY SPEED broke slow and inward, raced inside rivals at the back into the turn, drew closer while easing off the fence around the bend,
kept trying through the lane but could not get by BETTY PACK for third. PANCHO BARNES was off a bit slow to begin then climbed briefly shortly after, took
the turn two then three wide and failed to threaten. LADY QUICKSAND chased three deep between rivals leaving the backstretch, lost ground three then
two wide on the turn and failed to menace. FLIKA'S RIDE antsy in the gate, lifted then bobbled a bit at the start, traveled four deep into the turn, angled
down to the rail around the bend and was never a factor. GRAINNE O'MALLEY hit the gate and came out, showed early speed three deep then chased past
the half-mile pole, dropped back three to four wide on the turn, tired and eased in the lane and walked off.

CHARGE FOR GOLD took control from the rail position, headed at the midway point and dueled inside MOONLIT SONATA, carried a short lead over that
rival through the far turn, headed again in upper stretch, inched ahead past the eighth pole and put that rival away at the sixteenth pole while meeting the
challenge from PROMISSIO to the inside, dug in under right handed urging and kept that rival at bay while also lasting over the late rush from BADDA BING
(FR) in the closing moments. BADDA BING (FR) broke a step slow, chased off the rail then ran up on heels and checked around the first turn, raced outside
a rival off the pace in the middle stages, steadied behind a rival at the three-eighths pole, ran into traffic at the five-sixteenths marker, spun three wide into
the lane, angled out wide to launch a rally, surged late but ran out of time. PROMISSIO broke out and bumped on both sides, stalked along the rail behind
the top pair, continued on the fence through the far turn, roused at the top of the lane, launched a bid in the final furlong but could not summon the final kick
in deep stretch. RASTAMAN VIBE got knocked into outer rival at the start, unhurried after and moved inside, steadied and moved out on the first turn, trailed
up the backstretch, angled to the rail on the far turn, steered out and lacked room behind rivals in upper stretch, altered out wider and came with a late rally
to round out the superfecta. SORRENTO SKY (IRE) rated in the two path, chased three deep at the halfway point, moved back into the two path for the far
turn, steered out in the lane and finished well. ALL THAT GLORY broke out out and bumped rival, was a bit rank while forwardly place two wide into the
clubhouse turn, pressed between briefly at the nine-sixteenths pole then took back to stalk again, chased two wide through the far turn, tipped out in the
lane and finished evenly. MOONLIT SONATA tracked three deep around the clubhouse turn, tugged forward and challenged three deep at the half-mile
pole, dueled into the far turn, kept the pressure on around that bend, headed the winner again in upper stretch, fought to the sixteenth pole and faltered. EL
REY REY pulled while chasing from inside on the first turn, dropped back off the pace, hugged the rail to the stretch, moved out in the lane and needed to
find more. SKETCHY fractious in the gate, got bumped hard from inside at the start, pulled four deep early, tugged the rider to a forward position on the
backstretch, chased three deep into the far turn, dropped back around the bend and came up empty in the lane. THE RABBI off slow in the beginning and
dropped back, eased into the backstretch, pulled up at the half-mile pole and walked off.
