Footnotes
RHINO stalked in the two path around the first turn, closed in on the second bend, chased three deep into the stretch, grabbed the lead in upper stretch, put
VOLS away with a sixteenth remaining and held gamely over GHOSTLY ACT in the closing moments. GHOSTLY ACT settled inside, moved into range
while still patiently ridden on the rail then two wide on the second bend, roused while diving down to the inside at the top of the lane, launched a bid from
fence but could not get by the winner. VOLS tracked in the two path, went between rivals on the backstretch, steadied when running up behind a rival at the
three-eighths pole, took aim three wide into the stretch, tipped out and launched a bid but was turned away in the last sixteenth. WHATS THE BUZZ was
closest in pursuit through the early going, reeled in the leader midway on the far turn, took over at the quarter pole then cleared shortly after, lost command
in upper stretch, could not fight back in the furlong grounds and got edged for third. FIGHT BACK was off slow to begin, tucked inside near the back, drew
closer while continuing to save ground through the second bend, tipped out in upper stretch, lugged back to the inside midstretch and had to check between
rivals late. FINNERS GOLDNSENSE raced three wide towards the rear, rounded the far turn in the two path, steered out in the lane and could not rally.
BRAVO RAGAZZO unhurried in the early going, went two wide into the first turn then moved to the rail, saved ground to the stretch, then moved out and
failed to menace. MAXVILLE dropped back to last and moved inside early before tipping to the two path on the first turn, raced outside a rival at the back
through the middle stages, continued two wide into the lane and lacked a response when called upon. R AWESOME KID sat off the pace in the three path
of three deep, remained off the rail to the stretch and never threatened. SPOT D' ORO cleared quickly and moved over to the inside, opened up a large lead
on the backstretch, carried a rapidly diminishing lead to the five-sixteenths pole, lost command a quarter mile out and gave way.

INSTINCT D' ORO came away well, climbed a bit briefly when BEER MONEY crossed in front then chased three deep to the turn, moved into the two path
around the bend and drew alongside the leader at the quarter pole, put a head in front in upper stretch and drew clear in the final sixteenth. BEER MONEY
away quickest on the outside, cleared and crossed over, collared by the winner past the quarter pole, lost command at the top of the lane, stayed on to
midstretch and yielded late. PETESOLDFASHIONED hustled along early chasing between rivals, two wide through the turn, moved out at the top of the
stretch and lacked a bid. EIGHT CLAP chased the pacesetter inside a pair of rivals to the turn, saved ground around the bend, steered out in the stretch and
weakened.

HOTITUDE quickly took control from inside, pressure from outside then cleared leaving the backstretch, showed the way along the rail through the turn,
cornered nicely into the lane and remained clear under right handed urging and steady handling. REBALATION taken back early and moved inside, raced
inside a pair of rivals into the turn, remained patiently ridden around the bend, given her cue in upper stretch, rallied up the fence but could not reach the
winner. AVENTAPP stalked outside a rival then between foes past the half-mile marker, suffered a minor shuffle past the three-eighths pole, switched to the
inside and was ridden along before finding a bit more traffic entering the lane, tipped out in upper stretch and kept on to outfinish PALEO'S PRINCESS for
the show honors. PALEO'S PRINCESS raced up close outside the top pair early then chased three deep into and around the turn, moved out a bit in upper
stretch and got outkicked for third. A REAL JEWEL pressed the pace from outside then chased after the leader leaving the backstretch, rounded the bend
two wide, moved out in the lane and weakened. SEQUIN LADY tracked three deep then between rivals into the turn, took the turn two wide and failed to
menace. TEEN DRAMA stalked the pace from inside, chased along the rail inside a pair of rivals on the turn, came off the fence in upper stretch and
weakened. DADS ESTRELLA hit the gate and broke out, raced in hand four deep early then three deep into the turn, trailed off the rail into the stretch and
had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
J DUTTON bobbled to the front leaving the gate, took control from inside and led two wide leaving the first turn, cleared past the half-mile pole, drew away
on the second bend, held a comfortable lead to he sixteenth pole, grew weary late but managed to hold off a pair of late challengers. IT'S MY WORLD
chased four deep then five wide on the first turn, went three wide into the second bend before moving into the two path quickly, gave chase still out of range
while battling inside THE G M for the place honors entering the final furlong, came with a late run but ran out of time. THE G M raced up close three deep
then four wide early, chased three wide leaving the backstretch, spun four wide into the lane, rallied in tandem with IT'S MY WORLD late and got edged by
the rival for second. BLAME THE CLASSIC chased five deep into the clubhouse turn, got moved out to the six path then dropped back and moved back in
slightly, chased four wide into the far turn, five wide into the lane and failed to menace. PUDDIN HEAD JONES pressed the pace between foes to the
midway point, failed to kick on with the winner approaching the far turn, dropped back to last on the second bend and tired down the lane.

Footnotes
DOLLY MAY (IRE) traveled near the back on the inside, gained two then three wide on the far turn, tipped out at the top of the lane, rallied to the front at the
sixteenth pole and held gamely. CHEEKIEST settled inside, moved closer along the rail on the far turn, ran up behind rivals and had to tip out into the lane,
found more traffic in upper stretch, altered out with a furlong remaining and finished well to gain second. TRUE PATRIOT broke a step slow, steered to the
inside trailing the field, continued at the back now in the two path on the far turn, angled out into the lane, closed well from outside but got outfinished for the
place honors. MARINAS TINA (IRE) raced in mid-pack in the two path early on, moved into range between rivals on the backstretch, got put in tight by inner
rival and steadied at the five-sixteenths pole, chased three deep into the lane, tipped out at the eighth pole and launched a bid between rivals but got
outkicked in deep stretch. LEOPARDESS (GB) traveled in the two path towards the rear, moved closer three then four deep on the far turn, chased between
rivals in the lane and finished evenly when flagged with the crop and hand urged. DISRUPTIVE ARTIST stalked two wide, three deep into the far turn, bid
three deep around the bend, took over into the stretch, led to midstretch and yielded in the final sixteenth. BEAUTIFUL JANET rated in the two path stalking
the pacesetter, bid two wide at the three-eighths pole, put a head in front midway around the bend, lost command approaching the stretch, stayed on to the
sixteenth pole and weakened late. WEEMISSGRAMMY tracked inside, ran up on heels at the five-sixteenths pole and tipped to the two path, kept trying
through the lane but lacked room near the sixteenth pole and coasted in late. IFUAINTFIRSTURLAST grabbed the early lead and moved inside, set the
pace up the backstretch, challenged into the far turn, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole, chased after the new leader into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
DEVIL BE ME pressed inside a pair of rivals through the early going, took early on the turn, shook free from TOP GUN TOMMY into the lane and remained
clear to the wire. SUPER CHIEF lacked early speed, passed a rival leaving the backstretch, picked off a few more rivals four to five wide on the turn,
finished well in the lane and got up for second. LEFT HAND MAN chased from inside to the stretch, moved off the fence with a furlong remaining, could not
summon the needed rally to threaten the winner and got outkicked for second. ULTIMATE stalked off the inside, asked three wide around the turn and
flattened in the late stages. TOP GUN TOMMY vied three deep up the backstretch, bumped with inner rival into the turn, pressed the leader from outside
around the bend, failed to keep up entering the lane and faded. IT'S MY HOUSE raced in range early, angled into the two path for the turn, moved out to the
four path around the bend, began to lose ground and angled to the inside, then had little left for the drive. PEACEFUL WATERS vied between rivals for the
command, bumped with outer rival into the turn, got put in tight past the three-eighths pole and retreated. IDAHO ONCE stumbled leaving the gate, raced
near the back then trailed inside a rival three wide into the turn, angled down to the inside and failed to menace.

Footnotes
DANIEL'S MAGIC settled inside, saved ground through the turn, tipped out into the lane, dug in late and got up at the wire. ZOFFARELLI (IRE) chased
three deep to the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, steered back out to launch a bid in the lane and just missed. LOVESICK BLUES tracked
between rivals in the two path, angled out at the eighth pole, surged late and also missed. BEHIND ENEMY LINES (GB) raced up close on the inside then
had to take hold behind the leader at the nine-sixteenths pole, continued to stalk from the rail through the turn, bid between rivals late and also missed.
AGENCY showed good early speed and moved inside setting the tone up the backstretch with company to the outside, dueled with PLAYER B into the
stretch, inched ahead with a furlong left to run, resisted until the final moments and was overtaken by a quartet of rivals at the wire. CATALINA EDDY raced
near the back in the early going, drew closer approaching the turn, chased three deep around the bend, tipped out at the top of the stretch, rallied but got
outclosed in the final sixteenth. MAS RAPIDO (GB) unhurried from inside, trailed around the bend, angled out wide, summoned a mild rally but needed more
late. PLAYER B was off a bit slow and bobbled leaving the gate, went up to press from outside, dueled into the stretch, fought three deep at the eighth pole
and weakened between rivals.

Footnotes
LYELL'S SONG vied for the lead inside several rivals into the first turn, cleared into the backstretch, showed the way to the far turn, padded the lead under
some coaxing, then widened through the lane under light hand urging to win convincingly. CAPTAIN CHOOCHIES showed speed between rivals into the
first turn then chased after the leader into the backstretch, stayed in range from the two path through the far turn, was under a drive entering the lane, was
no match for the winner but was clearly second best. PALAGIO traveled outside a rival at the back early, drew closer still off the inside on the backstretch,
roused between rivals into the far turn, driven along the rail into the stretch and was along for the show honors. HURRICANE WAY chased along the rail into
the first turn then climbed around the bend, stalked in hand up the backstretch, drifted out to brush a rival on the far turn and dropped back, then kept trying
through the lane to earn a minor placing. MONGOLIAN MAX tucked inside at the back early, steered out to the four path on the far turn and improved
position down the lane. DURAN vied four deep into the first turn while bumping with outer rival, chased four then three wide around the far turn and lacked
the needed response. TRIPLE PASS up close five deep into the first turn and bumped with inner rival, took back and moved down into the three path
around the bend, went five wide into the far turn, moved back to the three path again and lacked a rally. NAVAJO WARRIOR vied three deep into the first
turn then chased outside rivals into the backstretch, remained three wide into the far turn, dropped back around that bend and was not persevered with
down the lane.

Footnotes
CALI BAY (IRE) stalked along the rail to the quarter pole then shifted to the two path, tipped out into the lane, challenged from outside with a furlong
remaining and proved best in deep stretch. THE GIANTS CANDY showed good early foot to take the front, set the pace from inside with company to the
outside on the backstretch, held a short lead through the far turn, resisted to the sixteenth pole and yielded to the winner late. GIOVINAZZO was closest in
pursuit through the early going a bit off the rail, flanked the leader from outside on the backstretch, continued to apply pressure through the far turn, fought
to upper stretch then faltered in the furlong grounds. VANTASTIC sat off the pace on the inside, saved ground through the far turn as well, put to right
handed urging along the fence in the lane and missed the show. FLAVIUS traveled in mid-pack along the fence early, drew closer while tipping three wide
leaving the far turn, chased within striking range at the eight pole but finished evenly late. MAN FRIDAY raced two wide near the back, ridden along the
same back on the far turn before moving to the inside and failed to threaten. AURELIAN MAN settled mid-pack off the rail, chased two wide into the far turn,
eased out to the four path around that bend and lacked a rally. MOODY JIM (IRE) was off a bit slow to begin, moved to the inside racing towards the rear,
drew a bit closer outside a rival then three deep in the middle stages, continued three wide through the far turn, moved out in the lane and lacked further
response. GENERAL MATHIS trailed a bit off the rail into the first turn, entered the far turn outside a pair of rivals, raced four deep midway around that
bend, kept wide to the stretch and could not rally. VANZZY stalked in the two path, lost positions on the far turn and faded in the lane.
