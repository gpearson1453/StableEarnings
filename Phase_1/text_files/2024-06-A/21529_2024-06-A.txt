Footnotes
BAD UNCLE BARRY prompted the pace outside, dueled into the lane, took over in upper stretch, put away inner rival then fought with RUSSELLS HUSTLE
to midstretch and edged clear in the final sixteenth. BROHEIM stalked the leaders from inside, saved ground through the bend, moved off the fence in upper
stretch, found the rail again and finished willingly to get up for second. RUSSELLS HUSTLE attended the pace three deep, continued to fight three wide into
the stretch, hounded BAD UNCLE BARRY to midstretch, then faltered in deep stretch and lost the place. THE OLD NINE (IRE) rated between rivals behind
the top trio early, chased outside a rival around the bend, tipped out into the lane and finished evenly late. SWEET ODYSSEY tracked three deep early,
raced greenly three then two wide on the turn and could not rally down the lane. WILD RECRUIT showed the way early under pressure from BAD UNCLE
BARRY to the outside, carried a short lead dueling along the rail around the bend, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong.
DIVISIBLE BY broke a step slow, jumped onto the dirt but was not cost any momentum, settled in hand on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and could
not make an impact. FRIENDS WITH FIDEL raced outside DIVISIBLE BY at the back early, spun three wide into the lane and was never a factor.

RESPECT THE CROWN chased behind the pacesetter on the inside, lost some ground while climbing on the turn, angled out at the quarter pole, rallied
from outside and overhauled the top pair in the final strides. ACE ACE BABY stumbled leaving the gate, recovered and went up to take control, cleared
outer rival leaving the backstretch, continued clear into the final furlong, resisted when challenged in deep stretch but got nailed by the winner.
DISCREPANCY off slow to begin, stalked outside rivals up the backstretch, gave chase outside a rival in the three path on the turn, came with a late bid in
deep stretch but lacked the needed final kick. SKY SAILING forced the pace early from outside, chased two wide leaving the backstretch, remained in the
two path to the stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
EL POTENTE brushed with inner rival at the start, stepped to the front and moved inside, received mild pressure from outside on the backstretch, inched
clear again at the quarter pole, confronted by CITY EXILE (GB) again approaching the eighth pole, responded to left handed urging and held that rival at
bay through the final furlong. CITY EXILE (GB) forwardly placed in the two path early, moved up to apply pressure on the backstretch, chased after the
leader past the quarter pole, challenged again into the stretch, finished gamely in the late stages but lacked the needed late punch to overtake the winner.
SEVEN WONDERS brushed with the winner leaving the gate, pulled early then took back and moved to the inside, chased two wide between runners on
the far turn and showed a mild response to get up for third. OTTOMAN PRINCE (IRE) stalked three wide into the first turn then moved into the two path,
roused two then three wide on the far turn, lacked the needed response and lost the show honors. SHORTMAN broke a step slow, trailed two wide around
the first turn, chased three deep at the five-sixteenths pole and failed to respond. MIDNIGHT LOVE pulled early and became rank along the rail, continued
up the inside stalking in the middle stages, trailed into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
EL DIABLO ROJO settled near the back, raced along the rail then angled out on the turn, spun four wide into the lane, collared the leader at the eighth pole,
kicked clear and won going away. STORMY SAMURAI fractious in the gate, sped clear and crossed over, showed the way along the rail then two wide into
the drive, challenged by the winner with a furlong left to run, yielded to that rival and stayed on to secure second. CROSS EXAMINE off slow to begin, saved
ground to the stretch and summoned a mild rally to gain third. FEROCIOUSLY tracked off the inside, took the turn two wide and could not rally in the lane.
PERFECTO AMOR antsy in the gate, chased two wide around the turn, three wide into the lane and flattened in the final furlong. OIL CAN KNIGHT chased
four wide into the turn, moved into the two path leaving bend and lacked further response. BRUTTO chased outside a rival to the turn, rounded the bend in
the three path and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
PURE MADNESS stalked three wide into and around the bend, rallied under left hand encouragement, drew alongside the leaders at the sixteenth pole and
drove clear. OSCAR JOY came away slow on the outside, sat off the pace outside a rival, shifted in and bothered a rival approaching the quarter pole,
shifted in again in upper stretch, angled out at the eighth pole and rallied for second. OSAGE CREEK brushed the gate, stalked from inside, tipped out into
the clear in the lane, finished willingly but got edged for second. PROSPER sped clear and steered to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, roused in
upper stretch, overtaken at the sixteenth pole and weakened late. CAILIN DANA closest in pursuit up the backstretch, chased outside a rival through the
turn and weakened in the final sixteenth. ROWLEY hit the gate and came away slow, got put in tight between rivals early, chased outside a rival at the back,
went two wide into the turn, altered out to avoid trouble rival at the quarter pole and failed to threaten. D' ORO DASH bobbled leaving the gate, pulled and
was hard to ride shifting inward early, trailed inside a rival into the turn, steadied around the bend and was not persevered with. PACIFIC QUEST off slow to
begin, came in and bothered ROWLEY early, got put in tight and checked on the turn and could not recover.

SUGAR FISH stumbled badly leaving the gate, allowed to settle along the inside, moved into range early on the backstretch then drew closer inside a pair of
rivals, given her cue past the three-eighths pole, challenged from the fence at the five-sixteenths marker and surged past outer rivals, asked right handed
into the lane, switch to the left hand in upper stretch and widened through the final furlong. NOTHING LIKE YOU stalked four then three wide around the
clubhouse turn, bid three deep midway on the far turn but could not keep up with SUGAR FISH approaching the quarter pole, chased outside JANE
AUSTEN through the lane and outfinished that rival for second. JANE AUSTEN stumbled a bit leaving the gate but recovered quickly took control early, led
two wide then along the rail on the clubhouse turn, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged on both sides at the five-sixteenths pole, started to drift
out and relinquished the lead to SUGAR FISH, corrected and chased the new leader two wide into the lane and got outkicked for the place honors. SHOW
CARD forwardly placed three then two wide outside the leader early, stalked between rivals leaving the backstretch, began to weaken on the far turn, trailed
near the inside into the lane and had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
MADIHA closest in pursuit early a bit off the rail, bid two wide on the far turn, took over into the stretch, put away inner rival at the eight pole, met the
challenge from the runner-up a sixteenth out and held gamely. INDY'S STAR rated along the inside early, chased two wide leaving the far turn, tipped out at
the top of the lane, launched a bid from outside in deep stretch but could not go by the winner. WORTHY OF MAGIC cleared quickly and crossed to the
inside, challenged by the winner on the far turn, relinquished the lead exiting the bend, fought to upper stretch, then flattened to third in the late stages.
ZEYARAAT off slow in the beginning, took the first turn three wide at the back, raced two wide towards the rear into the second bend, angled out and was
driven five wide into the lane and earned a minor award. DRAMATIZER raced in mid-pack from the two path early on, chased between rivals at the half-mile
pole, roused on the far turn but lacked room approaching the quarter pole, chased two wide into the lane and could not summon a rally. DREAM PRINCESS
stalked two wide around the clubhouse turn, navigated the far turn three wide and weakened. ANKYRAH broke through the gate and was reloaded, traveled
in the two path at the rear, moved to the inside still well off the pace into the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch and came up empty. JAMIES
INHERITANCE fractious in the gate, pulled along the inside and became hard to ride, dropped back to last and trailed up the backstretch, rounded the far
turn along the inside then two wide, ran into traffic late and had to steady and never threatened. OLE SILVER off slow in the beginning, sat off the pace in
the two path, went outside a pair of rivals on the backstretch, spun four wide into the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SHARP RIDE stalked from inside, paused briefly into the turn, shifted over to the two path, launched a bid at the top of the stretch, took over a furlong out
and drew away. BIG CELEBRATION pressed between early, got put in tight quarters at the seven-sixteenths pole, continued in range from the two path
outside a rival on the turn before angling out to the four path, challenged in upper stretch but was outkicked by the winner in the furlong grounds.
ELTONSINGSANOTHER vied four deep to the turn, three deep around the bend, got floated out at the top of the lane, fought to midstretch and faltered late.
RECALCITRANT vied three deep between rivals up the backstretch, inched ahead in the two path still between foes on the turn, drifted out at the top of the
lane, lost command near the eighth pole and weakened. ASIAN MATRIARCH crowded leaving the gate, trailed up the backstretch, raced along the rail then
two wide, moved out in the lane and passed tired rivals. PETITE ANGE chased well off the rail, traveled three then four wide on the turn, angled out in the
lane and failed to menace. PERFECT IN GRAY stumbled a bit leaving the gate, rushed up to fight for the lead inside a trio of rivals, fought along the rail
around the bend, could not keep up with the leader into the lane and faded out of contention.

Footnotes
CARVER hard to load into the gate, away alertly to take the front, set all the pace along the rail to the stretch, roused at the top of the lane, asked once right
handed midstretch and was kept busy to the wire. FERRARIANO stalked in the two path around the first turn, took aim two wide into the lane, could not
make any headway on the winner in the final furlong but stayed on to secure second. BALDORO chased two wide then between foes early, raced outside a
rival into the far turn, chased between again around that bend, moved out in the lane and finished evenly for a clear third. WHAT A DUDE settled in
mid-pack a bit off the rail, chased two wide on the far turn, tipped three wide into the lane, drifted in upper stretch and could not threaten late. KEEN TO GO
tucked inside off the pace, saved ground through the far turn as well, chased between foes in deep stretch and improved position. CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS
chased next to the fence, hugged the rail through the far turn, remained inside in the lane and weakened. DERECHO DANDY trailed on the inside six
furlongs, went two wide into the lane and failed to menace. ST IGNACIO raced well off the pace early on in the two path, continued a bit off the rail into the
far turn, swung five wide leaving the bend and could not make an impact. MY RANSOM tracked three wide or three deep early, stayed off the rail to the far
turn, asked four wide approaching the stretch and weakened.
