PRANCE stalked the pace in a clear pocket from four wide down the backside, rallied on the turn to engage the pacesetter from five wide in upper stretch
and closed well to pull away through the lane. JOY IN GRACE reserved off the pace five wide to the turn, angled in on the bend while steadily closing
ground on the turn, cut the corner coming home and rallied up the fence to be second best. MOHAYMEN DAY sped to the lead to set a pressured pace,
responded well when called upon in upper stretch and weakened late in the drive. BAKFIRE BABY pressed the pace to the head of the lane and flattened
out. DAZZLING CHIC was outrun.

Footnotes
CREDIBILITY prompted the pace to the top of the lane, drifted out turning for home, ralied from the six path in the stretch to wear the pacesetter down late
in the lane in a determined drive. DANCING WILLIE set the pace under mild pressure throughout, responded when challenged in upper stretch and was
out-finished in deep stretch in a game effort while clearly second best. BARE BACK JACK stalked the pace through the turn and lacked a closing response
when called upon. SPORTSCARR tracked the leaders from five wide and failed to mount a closing bid. RUNNINFORCOVER saved ground to no avail
failing to menace. SMARTY RIVER PANTS trailed throughout as a non-factor.

Footnotes
HENRY'S GAMBLE stalked the pace from three wide down the backside, angled to the rail impeding COUNT ON IT nearing the three-eighths pole, saved
ground on the bend, angled back out to the four path and closed well to prevail in the stretch drive. TEXAS TIDELANDS slow early to be the trailer,
commenced a steady advance on the turn and continued to gain ground willingly through the lane. BOOTIFUL ROSE set the pace on a clear lead to the top
of the lane and could not hold off the closers in deep stretch. COUNT ON IT broke a step slow, moved up the fence to track the leaders into the turn,
checked sharply entering the turn when the winner crossed over to the rail, regained momentum turning for home and made a mild bid in the stretch.
LINAHASPECSHOES prompted the pace from three wide through the turn and faded in the stretch. WHISKARITA was not a threat. THE STEWARDS
POSTED AN INQUIRY AND THE RIDER OF COUNT ON IT CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE BY HENRY'S
GAMBLE, AFTER A LENGTHY REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED THE WINNER AND PLACED HIM FOURTH.

Footnotes
BURNING UP set the pace on a clear lead, was well rated while slowing the pace in the second quarter, responded when called upon to widen the
advantage and finished unthreatened through the lane. SIZZLIN ROSE stalked the pace through the turn, made a mild bid turning for home and kept-on
willingly as second best while failing to threaten the winner. PARZANNI tracked the leaders from between rivals down the backstretch, was set to a drive on
the turn and lacked a closing response. SWEETSINGINGANGEL reserved off the pace to the top of the lane and made a four wide mild rally in the stretch.
STARMA fractious in the gate, broke well to prompt the pace to the head of the lane and flattened out in the drive. LOVEMOR trailed most of the way as no
threat. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL was not a factor while steadily fading.

Footnotes
DELIRIUM stalked the pacesetter through the turn, rallied to the lead from four wide in upper stretch and held off the closer in a determined drive.
LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR tracked the leaders from five wide through the turn, rallied down the outside in the lane to duel for the lead in deep stretch and
was denied in a good effort. LITTLE CHICAGO well placed along the fence in striking distance, cut the corner at the head of the lane , loomed up the fence
in mid-stretch and was out-finished late in the drive. FORGOTTEN VOWS rated in mid-pack throughout and showed some late interest in the lane. BIG AL'S
VISION set the pace on a clear lead to the head of the stretch and weakened in the stretch. KOVACS was one-paced failing to menace. CALI CONQUEST
was not a threat. BROKEN FINGER was not a factor.

Footnotes
THE BEAT pressed the pace from between rivals through the turn, flattened out in upper stretch losing position and came again up the fence in deep stretch
to prevail. ESTIFRAAD reserved off the pace while saving ground along the fence to the head of the lane, tipped out gaining ground in upper stretch, angled
to the clear inside the eighth pole and surged late to be up for the place. WALKTHELINE stalked the pace from three wide through the turn, took the lead
nearing the quarter pole, responded willingly through the lane and was out-kicked in the final hundred yards. MOUNT ASGARD trailed in the early going and
mounted a belated rally in the stretch. ALL RUN squeezed at the start to be at the back of the field, trailed turning for home and showed good late energy to
be gaining in deep stretch. ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) went evenly failing to mount a rally. BON PRIX tracked the pace into the turn, rallied five wide on the
bend to loom turning for home abd failed to sustain the bid through the stretch. THESHACK flashed speed to be the early leader and steadily gave way
coming home.

Footnotes
RIVERSIDE pressed the pace for the first half mile, took control turning for home, opened a clear lead in the lane and held the closer safe. COOLWIND slow
early to be the distant trailer down the backside, rallied through traffic in the lane and clsoed with a belated rush to be gaining in deep stretch. PARKING
PERMIT unhurried early to be at the back of the main pack, made a steady advance and was along willingly to gain the show. A MAN'S MAN set a
pressured pace in quick fractions and weakened through the stretch run. KYSTONE tracked the leaders from the fence and made a mild bid in the lane.
POINT TO THE STARS failed to menace. EL NOBLE showed some early foot to be well placed behind the first flight and was never a threat from there.
TAKE CHARGE CURLY contenced from five wide in the turn and flattened out turning for home. DERZKII well placed to be stalking the leaders into the turn
and was through after a half mile.
