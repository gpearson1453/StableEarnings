Footnotes
ALWAYS SMILING dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and held clear to the finish. EXTRA INDY tracked the
leader on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend and chased on to the finish. PAT'S GAL dueled on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and kept on in the lane. PAGEANT PURRFECT chased the leader between horses early, came around
the turn in the four path and weakened in the stretch. I CAME TO SHAME stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path
coming around the turn and faded from there. AMARETTO DI AMORE trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path and
was never a factor.
