for place. VANTASTICCANAVERAL sped clear and shifted in, set the pace inside, was overtaken in upper stretch and had no late kick. LAHUN raced at the
back off the inside, moved to the rail at the four- and one-half, saved ground on the turn, ran on. H K MELODY stalked from outside three wide, went evenly

Footnotes
LANNY MAC got away alertly, set the pace from off the rail with inside pressure early, moved clear three furlongs out, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, held
a rival at bay under steady handling. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR stalked the eventual winner in behind and inside, moved out while advancing three then
four wide on the turn, continued to gain steadily outside through the lane but was only second best. SIMMS shifted in early while lacking speed, saved
ground on the turn, came out two to three wide for the stretch run, was best of the rest. CASHLINGS stalked from outside racing mostly four to five wide,
failed to rally. MOONSHINE NOW pressed the eventual winner inside early, faded. KOVACS was kept wide four to five deep early and into the turn, failed to
threaten.

Footnotes
EXAMINER was taken up about the three-quarters and shuffled back, soon made a steady advance along the rail, came out a path for the drive, bid inside a
foe a sixteenth out and edged clear. CAB SAV made a swift early advance inside foes but off the fence, ranged up four wide alongside the leaders, bid at
the five-sixteenths taking the lead, led till a sixteenth out and was outkicked but clearly second best. TIGERITO was five to six wide through most of the
running, ran on mildly late to get show honors. CARSON'S LEGACY raced mostly five to seven wide and passed tired rivals. JULIUS THE GREAT pressed
the pace from inside just off the rail, bid near the seven-sixteenths taking a brief lead, came up empty. TRUMP UM set the pace racing three wide with
inside then outside pressure, began to weaken on the turn, checked at the top of the stretch, faded. ALL THAT GOLD raced four to five wide early and off
the leaders, failed to rally.

NORTHERN FORCE was bumped from both sides at the start, settled off the pace, advanced four to five wide turning for home, engaged the lead in mid- to
late-stretch, dueled then surged past. FORCED TO RUN pressed the pace from inside, took the lead outside the nine-sixteenths, moved clear by the
three-eighths, drifted out leaving the turn, was engaged past mid-stretch, dueled briefly and was outfinished. HARD DIAMOND was bumped and bobbled
just after the start, eased back off the leading pair, tracked those near inside, was in range at the top of the stretch, could not go on with the top ones but
fought on to garner third. WHEN U KNOW U KNOW veered out at the break, forced the early pace from outside, dropped back from the three-eighths, kept
on but needed more and was outkicked for show. MOON MULLINS brushed the gate and bumped a rival at the start, was outside foes and never near
enough to threaten. PADDY'S SPEEDSTER was well off the leaders, saved ground on the turn, came out in the stretch, ran on. OUR SUNSHINE broke
outwardly bumping a rival, was never a threat. MORE THAN A FLASH bumped a rival at the start, was never a threat. LEGAL ASSASSIN veered into the
gap at the start and lost the rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

TICKET TO THE TOP came in a bit at the break but went quickly to the front, set the pace just off the rail, moved clear, was put to urging in upper stretch
and won going away. SHINING TIGER stalked from outside, went four wide on the turn, was second best. LATE NIGHT LIVING was bumped at the start,
raced mostly four to five wide advancing on the turn, ran on. HARBOR DANCER was up close pursuing the winner two to three wide, came up empty.
LIGHTNING STRIKING shifted in up the backstretch, rode the rail into the turn just in behind the leaders but tapped on the brakes about the
seven-sixteenths, had to do so again nearing the five-sixteenths, was guided out at that juncture and again in upper stretch, failed to rally. DOUG'S HERO
bumped a rival at the start, chased inside a rival but well off the rail, faded. HALLISAR broke outwardly, was outpaced and never a threat.

RECIO'S SKYE switched outside foes heading up the backstretch, went four wide into the turn, took aim in upper stretch, ground on steadily gaining slowly
on the leader then surged past late. FASTESTGIRLINTOWN was urged from the break and soon took charge, set the pace from off the rail, moved clear on
the turn, was caught late. CHURCH HARBOR got away well, settled just off the leader stalking mostly three to four wide, kept on in the stretch, held show.
QUEEN RHONDA exchanged a bump at the start, angled in before the turn, saved ground on that bend, improved inside. NO MORE JO KING bumped with
a rival at the start, raced outside five to six wide, kept on evenly in the stretch but needed more. VILLA NOVA shifted in up the backstretch, swung seven
wide turning for home, failed to menace. CUVEE TEE got away well, chased from off the rail, came out in the stretch, failed to rally. SHAKEITFORMEGIRL
brought up the rear inside, swung six wide turning for home, was never a threat.

Footnotes
VARATTI broke a step slowly, was encouraged along and gradually moved forward inside, took over the lead passing the half, drifted out turning for home,
held under steady handling. BRODY'S PAL stalked four wide in the early going, gained steadily and slowly through the stretch but was only second best.
PACHECO lacked early speed and angled in, saved ground racing inside, came out three to four wide in the stretch, ran on but needed more. STREET
VENDOR settled toward the rear, swung seven wide into upper stretch, showed mild late interest. VICTORIA'S CHIEF shifted in early, saved ground on the
turn, faded in the stretch. GURRIAN set the early pace from off the rail, chased the new leader into and on the turn, drifted five wide out of that bend,
weakened, bled. SIX SHOTS OF T chased five wide early, faded. TAPFERSURE was devoid of early speed racing off the inside, failed to threaten.

stalked from outside through the turn four to five wide, kept on strongly in the end but was only second best. NORTHERN JEWEL chased five wide, angled
in leaving the backstretch tracking in behind and saving ground through the turn, bid up the rail near the sixteenth pole but was outfinished. STONE
CARVER was coaxed clear soon after the start, set the pace from off the rail, was outkicked. VIATURE raced mid-pack outside a rival going three wide on
the turn, was one-paced. COUNTRIFIED lacked early speed, saved ground on the turn, came out in the stretch, failed to menace. WHERE'S THE GOLD
lacked early speed racing outside at the rear through the turn about four deep, failed to threaten. BODEMONSTER was unhurried early bringing up the rear,
improved inside in the stretch. QUINTO SOL was mid-pack, saved ground inside on or just off the rail, faltered and faded in the stretch.
