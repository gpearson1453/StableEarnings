Footnotes
GEOMETRIQUE remained well rated along the rail throughout the early furlongs, then inched up leaving the second half to gain command by a nose,
maintained the lead on the far turn then drew clear in the late stretch while in a strong drive to prevail. WOODHULL set the pace from the inside in the early
furlongs, was overtaken for the lead by an inner foe heading into the far turn, continued to press the emerging leader while in a strong bid but did not have
enough to regain command in the stretch and held the place prize in the end. ARR PIRATETREASURE raced in the middle of the packs while two wide,
was in a steady drive on the far turn, gained third position then continued to bid down the lane but did not have enough and held the show prize. CIRCA
STAR tracked the pace from the two path at a moderate pace throughout and lacked rallying in the final furlongs. CACTUS BLOSSOM settled along the rail
in the back trio of rivals and was flat throughout and needed rally. MISTY MOOD trailed at the back early and failed to rally. CALLIN FOR DOLLARS was no
menace.

Footnotes
ALL MIGHT pressed the pace down the backstretch while two wide, continued to stalk the leader on the turn while in a strong drive, then dug in with ALL
MIGHT to edge clear in the late stretch and held on well while in an all out drive to prove best. DEVITO chased the pace from the inside down the
backstretch, then urged eagerly on the turn to rally in the stretch and got up for the place position in the late stretch while closing well in the end. ALPHABET
ADAMS led the way from the inside down the backstretch while being pressured by outer foes, then moved up to clear the turn, was in a hard drive then
faltered in the stretch and held onto the show position. DOC HENRY RIDGE was allowed to settle along the rail towards the back down the backstretch,
then menaced leaving the turn but it was to no avail in the end. WITT SWEET SIXTEEN pressed the leader while three wide and in a hard drive down the
backstretch, was used up entering the turn and flattened out in the stretch. DADA BOOM RIDGE drifted out and bumped rival at the start and was no threat.
THRILL OF HOPE broke inwardly and bumped foe and was no threat. TEXAS REIGN was bumped on both sides at the start and failed to menace.

SHARP LIKENESS pressed the pace while three wide, then moved up on the turn to gain command at the quarter pole then was kept to task down the lane
to prove best in the end. JENNY'S PENNY raced in the middle of the two fields of rivals along the rail, then came out three wide leaving the bend while in
strong bid, gained second position in the late stretch but could not catch the leader in the end. BIDOFHONEY broke inwardly then set the pace from the
inside, was in a steady hand ride on the turn, was overtaken for the lead by an outer rival at the quarter pole, menaced gamely in the stretch but could not
regain the lead and was best for the show prize. POETIC UNION was impeded at the start, then raced at the back while three wide, bid along the rail on the
turn and came up empty in the end. KAYLEE'S SHADOW broke outwardly and was no threat. CANDY TAP stalked the pace while three wide, then flattened
out heading into the turn and lacked rallying in the stretch. GREY HALO was no menace.

Footnotes
HALAGA broke inwardly, then led the way from gate, was rank heading into the first turn, settled back in fourth position along the rail down the backstretch,
then dug in gamely leaving the far turn to split rivals in the late stretch and was up time to claim victory. SAN MATEO KAT tracked the pace while two wide
into the backstretch, then rallied leaving the far turn, gained command at the eighth marker, was in an all out drive then was caught at the wire and was
second best. PAINTBRUSH saved ground in the early furlongs while racing two wide in the back pack, then came out four wide leaving the far turn to
menace in the early stretch and closed well for the show prize. ALLIACEOUS was unhurried early, continued to save ground at the back of the field down
the backstretch, then fanned out five to six wide leaving the far turn and closed willingly down the lane but it was too late in the end. GASTOWN was
impeded at the start, then shuffled back, was unhurried early, then advanced from the three path leaving the half, rallied gamely in the early stretch in
attempt to gain command, lacked the winning bid and gave way in the end. MISSION BELLE moved from the inside into the first turn to press the pace while
two wide down the backstretch, moved up to duel with the pace setter on the far turn, took command in the upper stretch then was out finished in the end.
STREET TAPPER broke outwardly, was allowed to along the rail towards the back down the backstretch, then bid mildly on the far turn while three wide and
came up flat in the stretch. HASHTAG WINNER saved ground while two wide in the early furlongs while racing mid pack, then lacked rallying in the second
half of the course and was no threat. STOIC LUNA angled inwards to set the pace along the rail into the first turn, was challenged by an outer foe heading
into the far turn, was used up and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
MADE AN OFFER led the way into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch, was challenged by an outer foe leaving the far turn, sparred
grudgingly down the lane and was determined to prevail and was up in the final strides to do so. UTSIRA stalked the pace while two wide in the early
stages, then moved up on the far turn to duel with MADE AN OFFER in the early stretch, could not out bid the determined rival and was outkicked in the
end. SOTONA tracked the pace while two wide in the early furlongs, then menaced leaving the far turn and closed well for the show prize in the end. KARA
raced in the middle of the pack from the inside down the backstretch, then urged eagerly on the far turn and kept down the lane while in a mild rally to no
avail in the end. PRONUNCIATION tracked the pace from the inside, was in a long drive on the far turn, could not overpower the leader in the upper stretch
and gave way in the end. PANTHERA was allowed to settle along the inside in the back duo down the back stretch, then rallied leaving the far turn but it
was too little too late in the end. CHARMING LEAH raced in the middle of the pack while two wide, then rallied mildly leaving the far turn and came up
empty in the end. UNLUCKY IN LOVE was no threat. TIZ A KNOCKOUT was bumped after the break, shuffled back and was no menace. SPIRIT SMOKE
bumped inner at the start and trailed throughout.
