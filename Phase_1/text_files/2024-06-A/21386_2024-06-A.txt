Footnotes
MISS TAPPY TONE laid off of the pace four wide, launched a rally in the five path turning for home, gained place in upper stretch, closed in on the clear
leader through the final furlong while hanging on her left lead, offered a late bid and edged past in the shadow of the wire. SHERBET FOUNTAIN jostled an
inner rival at the start, vied two wide, drove clear nearing the lane, held sway as an outer challenger ranged up in the final sixteenth but was worn down
approaching the wire. COLLECT A LIL raced forwardly four wide and betweeen horses, pursued from midpack around the turn, got outkicked by an outer
rival entering the lane yet stayed on to gain show in midstretch. BYZANTINE pursued from midpack two wide, chased along the inside around the turn, then
improved inside of rivals at the furlong grounds. GROVE ST. bumped an outer rival at the start, then had her hind heels clipped by that one at the eleven
sixteenths pole, pursued from off of the pace in the three path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch and moved up. SHE'S MAGIC saved ground off of
the pace, moved up but failed to menace. ALMOND FUDGE vied for the lead with an outer rival around the turn, yielded nearing the lane, shifted off of the
fence in upper stretch and weakened between horses. KACHOW tracked five wide, tucked three wide chasing closest to the dueling leading pair into the
turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. DOUBLE OVERTIME broke a step slow, trailed in the three to two path, shfited out to the six path in
upper stretch and made little impact. DANCING NANCY pressed three wide and between horses, failed to sustain pressure nearing the half mile pole,
pursued from midpack in the three path and among foes around the turn and weakened in upper stretch. TAMARA'S WAY broke a step slow, raced off of
the pace in the five path and tired. SINGSATIONAL was jostled between horses and squeezed back at the start, clipped a rival's hind heels and fell at the
eleven sixteenths pole, then walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
HAILSTORM tracked three wide, pursued between horses around the turn, ranged up to bid leaving upper stretch, forged a narrow advantage at the furlong
pole, inched ahead with a sixteenth to go and held from an outer bidder. STORMIN TANDA broke outwardly, tracked four deep around the turn, sustained a
grinding pursuit through the final furlong, closed in on the leader late but needed more to reel him in. READIER stalked outside of the clear leader, bid along
with an outer rival leaving upper stretch, vied in the final furlong, but was bested by his outer counterpart and yielded late. REMARKABLE MO raced off of
the pace in the three path, shifted out to the six path in midstretch and ran on late. SECOND SERVICE broke slowly, was allowed to lag behind early on,
rejoined the group entering the turn, trailed along the inside before tipping to the three path in upper stretch and stayed on willingly. MISCHIEVOUS M
rushed clear early on, maintained a clear margin around the turn and into upper stretch, but was overhauled by an outer pair nearing the furlong grounds
and weakened. GUN SHOW tracked along the inside and faded turning for home.

Footnotes
BARBRATINA tracked four to three wide around the first turn, bid outside of the top pair and in the four path with three furlongs to go, vied into the lane,
dueled through midstretch, led narrowly as an outer rival bid in the final sixteenth and held. STANDOUTSENSATION stalked close up along the inside,
pursued shifting out around the far turn, tipped to the five path to take aim outside of the leading trio entering the lane, drifted out briefly at the furlong
grounds, flopped back to her left lead straightening, sustained slow progress to offer a late bid but missed. LITTLE JAMIE pressed three to two wide around
the first turn, wrestled a narrow advantage as an outer rival bid at the three furlong pole, dueled with that one through upper stretch, gamely battled into the
final sixteenth but was bested late. UNDER THE PALMS set the pace two wide before tucking around the first turn, got headed while inside of a pair of rivals
at the three furlong pole, failed to sustain vying position nearing the lane, yet kept on willingly for a minor share. JUST BASKING was allowed to settle at the
rear soon after the start, saved ground while trailing, moved out of last around the far turn, improved position in the two path in upper stretch and stayed on.
CAT'S CAVE broke half a beat slow, tracked two wide and between horses while pulling in the bit around the first turn, checked back approaching the
backstretch, chased the main group from the three to four path around the far turn and gave way. PRETTY ANA laid off of the pace along the inside, then
two wide around the far turn and failed to factor. WEE BIT O MISCHIEF was keen among foes early on, raced off of the pace two to three wide around the
first turn, but was through approaching the lane.

Footnotes
BELLS BEACH broke outwardly, tracked three wide, then in the four path and in range outside of the leaders around the turn, offered a bold bid entering the
lane, kicked away in upper stretch and drove clear. SOUNDBITE bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked behind the leaders and in the two path, chased
the clearing eventual winner while shifting to the four path in upper stretch, claimed place entering the final furlong in the five path as an outer rival took aim,
and held that position thereafter. UNION MIST broke a bit outwardly leaving the gates, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, took the turn in the
three path before tipping to the five path entering the lane, ran on to take aim on place in the six path in midstretch, but was fended off through the final
furlong. CHILLED chased from midpack along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the lane and moved up. TAP THE CHAMPAGNE broke a step
slow and shied from an outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the four path, fanned six to seven wide into the lane and improved outside of rivals.
BELLOFTHEBLUEGRASS broke a bit outwardly, pressed three deep, vied turning for home, got swiftly outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch, lost
place to an outer rival at the furlong grounds and faded. KISS ME AGAIN laid off of the pace in the four to five path, floated to the six path entering the lane
and failed to factor. HAPPY HAPPY brushed the outer stall door and was off slow, trailed along the inside early on, moved out of last in the three path and
between horses entering the turn, then failed to menace among rivals. LEAFLET lacked speed along the inside, trailed leaving the three furlong pole, then
surpassed tired rivals. CARARRA prompted two wide and between horses, led narrowly at the three furlong pole, but offered little resistance to an outer
challenge entering upper stretch and faltered through the final furlong. MISS MAXIMUS took contact from an outer rival at the start, shifted out while leading
nearing the end of the chute, showed the way along the inside, got headed by a pair of bidders at the three furlong pole, weakened nearing the lane and
caved.

MISS JUSTIFY vied for the lead with an outer rival while remaining a path off of the rail around the turn, shook clear in upper stretch and held sway.
SIMPLY ENCHANTING vied for the lead outside of the eventual winner and from the three path, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart while
meeting an outer challenge for place in upper stretch, then gamely fended off that bidder through the final furlong. MINK'S PALACE pressed the top pair
from the five to four path into the turn, required urging to sustain pressure around the turn, bid for place entering upper stretch, but was kept at bay.
TWEETSTER tracked from off of the pace in the five path, crept closer turning for home, but only managed to chase through the lane and edged fourth late.
MERASOL SUGAR stalked along the inside, then a path off of the rail around the turn, took aim inside of the leader entering the lane, but only managed to
chase before fading. AMERICA'S VOW broke a step slow, raced off of the pace in the five to six path, shfited inwardly in upper stretch and ran on mildly
between horses. WONDER RIDE bobbled and bumped an outer rival at the start, saved ground off of the pace, chased in the two path in upper stretch and
lacked a bid. SUMMERINTAHOE bumped an inner rival at the start, raced forwardly in the three path and between horses to the turn, but gave way.
SABRINA was tough to load, then stuttered a step and was off slowly, trailed along the inside, improved nearing the lane and made little impact. LIUZZA
pursued from midpack in the four path and between horses, then tired. THESE APPLES got keen when bumped between rivals at the start, lacked speed
two wide and got outrun. CHANGE THE PLAY lacked speed along the inside, shifted to the three path into the turn and showed little.

Footnotes
OTTOMAN FLEET (GB) got briefly keen while easing off the leaders early on, stalked along the inside into the first turn, tipped three wide to take aim
outside of the top pair entering upper stretch, bid and forged an advantage at the furlong grounds, inched clear late and held sway. CHASING THE CROWN
settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted out four wide in upper stretch, rallied outside of rivals in the final furlong, claimed place while flopping back to
his left lead and taking aim on the leader in the final sixteenth, but was fended off through the late stages. IRISH ACES pressed three to two wide, vied
around the far turn, led briefly in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and yielded place late. NORTHERN INVADER
set the pace inside of a pressing rival, vied with that one around the far turn, got headed as a wider rival took aim in upper stretch and gradually yielded
through the final furlong. SMOKIN' T leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, tracked two wide, got floated four to five wide in upper stretch and faded.
EMMANUEL broke a beat slow and was bumped and bothered by an outer rival at the start, trailed along the inside, tipped off of the fence turning for home
but made little impact.

Footnotes
CLOSETHEGAME SUGAR tracked in the two path, pursued in the three to four path around the turn, took aim outside of the clear leader in upper stretch,
sustained gradual progress to offer a bid at the sixteenth pole and drove past late. SKELLY tugged forward after breaking a beta slow, showed the way
outside of a prompting rival early on, disposed of that one nearing the turn, led in the two path as an outer rival applied pressure around the bend, shook
clear in upper stretch, but was collared by an outer challenger at the sixteenth pole, gave in late and held place. TEJANO TWIST broke a step slow and
trailed down the backstretch, advanced in the three path around the turn before swinging to the five path entering the lane, then offered a good belated kick
but was too late to complete a bid for place. HERE MI SONG stalked three wide, pressed the leader from the three path around the turn, failed to sustain
pressure entering the lane, then yielded whlie hanging on his left lead and drifted inwardly in the final sixteenth. PAYNE pursued from off of the pace in the
two path, sustained a chase shifting inwardly at the furlong grounds, but lacked a bid before being put to tight quarters by an outer rival nearing the wire.
BOURBON HEIST lacked speed along the inside and never got involved. ANGKOR prompted along the inside, but gave way into the turn and faded.

SCYLLA prompted outside of the leader while remaining a path away from that one, vied around the far turn, drew clear entering the lane and inched away
under a drive. XIGERA showed the way inside of a prompting rival, vied with that one around the far turn, got headed turning for home, proved no match for
her outer counterpart entering the lane, shfited out in midstretch and held place. WET PAINT stalked along the inside, chased while failing to sustain
position around the far turn, yet sustained stride in upper stretch, flopped back to her left lead at the sixteenth pole and stayed on willingly to regain show
late. HOOSIER PHILLY tracked two wide and between horses, stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path around the far turn, chased them
entering the lane, but lacked a bid in the final furlong and lost show to an inner foe late. HIDDEN CONNECTION stalked outside of the leaders and from the
four path, chased in the five path around the far turn and faded. MAGICAL LUTE raced towards the rear along the inside, shifted out to the two to three path
and between horses around the first turn, retreated to trail entering the far turn, swung out to the five path entering the lane and failed to factor.
BELLAMORE was off a beat slow while last away, trailed in the the three to four path around the first turn, moved out of last into the far turn and made little
impact. TAKE A STAND pursued from the two to three path, then tired between horses. MALLOY saved ground off of the pace to no avail.

Footnotes
PIN UP BETTY rated at the rear in the three to four path, gained ground outside of rivals around the far turn, bid while hanging on her left lead in upper
stretch, forged an advantage reaching the furlong grounds, changed leads and lugged out multiple paths while clearing entering the final sixteenth, and held
sway safely. BUCHU laid off of the pace in the two to three path, swung out to the five path entering the lane, then ran on willingly to gain place in the final
sixteenth. GAVEA (GER) prompted two wide, vied around the far turn, led narrowly entering the lane, but was headed by an outer bidder at the furlong
grounds, yielded place in the final sixteenth and saved show. EVERLAND saved ground pursuing from midpack, chased in the two path in upper stretch,
shifted to the three path in the final furlong and missed reaching a tiring rival for show. WAY TO BE MARIE broke a beat slow while last away from the
gates, set the pace inside of a pressing rival, vied with that one around the far turn, but was headed entering the lane, gave way and was found to have
bled. HELLO HOLLYWOOD stalked the top pair from the two to three path, but faded between horses in upper stretch. SASSY PRINCESS saved ground
towards the rear, but was outrun through the lane.

Footnotes
HIGHLAND FALLS tracked from midpack along the inside, came under a drive in the two path with three furlongs to go, tipped to the three path to take aim
on the new leader entering the lane, sustained slow progress leaving midstretch and edged past in the final sixteenth. CAGLIOSTRO pressed two wide, vied
into the far turn, led nearing the lane, drew clear in upper stretch but was worn down by an outer bidder in the closing stages. DREAMLIKE laid off of the
pace two wide and between horses, pursued in the three to four path around the far turn before drifting to the six path entering the lane, wandered about
subtly while chasing into midstretch, then secured show in the final furlong to prove best of the rest. TRADEMARK tracked in the three path, chased under a
drive turning for home, got floated four wide entering the lane and gave way. FROSTED DEPARTURE showed the way along the inside, but was headed by
an outer prompter nearing the lane and weakened. WAR CAMPAIGN saved ground at the rear, but to no avail. LAST SAMURAI laid off of the pace in the
three to four path, but tired turning for home in the five path.

CUGINO set a clear pace, widened in midstretch and was driven home. LAGYNOS pursued three to four wide, rallied to bid for place along with an inner
rival leaving the furlong grounds, dueled for that position and prevailed. CAMARO Z was bumped by an inner rival at the start, tracked three wide, bid for
place along with an outer rival in the final furlong, sparred for that position but was bested. ROCK'N A HALO rated well back in the two to four path, fanned
six wide entering the lane, brushed with an inner rival in upper stretch and stayed on. CAMEO PERFORMANCE pursued from midpack in the two path,
brushed an outer rival shifting to the five path in upper stretch and ran on mildly. FORMIDABLE MAN bumped an outer rival leaving the gates, stalked
outside of the clear leader, chased that one in upper stretch and weakened leaving the furlong grounds. THOMAS AQUINAS tracked along the inside and
yielded. NOMOS laid off of the pace along the inside, then in the three path around the far turn, entered the lane in the five path and between horses but
made little impact. CAN GROUP lagged behind along the inside, saved ground rejoining the rest entering the lane but failed to factor.
