PERFECT PENNY tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch, while racing three wide at the back of a compact field, commenced her bid four wide
entering the final turn, and closed willingly three out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. NOTHINGBUTSUNSHINE broke sharply and vied for the
lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside, was overtaken approaching the final turn, got fought on
willingly from along the rail through the turn, but was outfinished in the late stages. PENALTY TO RANGERS away alertly and dueled for the lead two wide

JOSE JOSE away alertly, and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, relaxed on an uncontested lead in the run down the backstretch,
held a clear advantage into the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late while being kept to task. TIME TICKER stalked the pacesetter into the
backstretch while saving ground at the rail, continued to save ground while commencing his bid approaching the final turn, and finished willingly from just off
the rail in the drive to prove easily second best. PRINCE CAIRO unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched his bid from along the inside entering
the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive to get up for a share. SLOOP JOHN B rushed up entering the first turn to track the pacesetter one out from
the rail, was unable to keep tabs on the pacesetter entering the final turn and had little left for the drive finishing three out from the rail. BRIAN'S DE LEIGHT
broke sharply and stalked the leader into the backstretch while hung three wide, continued with a wide trip four wide entering the final turn, but failed to
make a late impact when called upon.

WESTMINSTER broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of QUATRE BAK in the
run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn while edging clear of rivals, and widened his margin late. RUN RUDOLF tracked the
leaders into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, advanced smartly midway down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and
finished one out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. WHAT'S SHAKIN stalked the early pace while racing two wide at the back of a
compact field, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly two out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly best of the rest.
QUATRE BAK away alertly and pressed the leader one out from the rail entering the first turn, continued to force the issue in the run down the backstretch,
struggled to stay with the top pair entering the final turn, and was outfinished over the final furlong. CROWN COUNCIL was fractious prior to the start but
was away well, was forced in early and steadied sharply at the rail in the run to the wire the first time, pulled himself into a tracking trip at the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but was unable to mount a late bid. HORATIO stalked the leaders into the backstretch while
racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. Following the running of this race there was a
jockey's claim of foul. The rider of CROWN COUNCIL lodged a claim of foul against the rider of WESTMINSTER for alleged interference in the early going.
Following a review, the claim of foul was upheld and WESTMINSTER was disqualified from first and placed fifth.

QUEEN OF ATTITUDE was off a step slow, but moved up through the first turn to assume a stalking trip two wide entering the backstretch, rallied smartly
three wide through the final turn, and prevailed in the final strides over a stubborn rival. NINE OCLOCK CEASER broke sharply and raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the first run, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and through the final turn while continuing to save ground, and just
failed to last. SILK STILETTOS tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide entering the final turn
from between rivals, was no match for the top pair late, but finished four wide in the drive to garner a share. MISS THE HYPE settled off the leaders while
racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished with some late interest. BELLAROO
unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact when called upon.
JERSEY LILLIE away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, struggled to keep tabs on the leaders entering the
final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

CURLIN ROCKS raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of SHURAZ in the run down the backside,
shook clear of his pace rival approaching the final turn, and pulled clear in the lane to prove best. BUZZINGA KARMA stalked the early pace while racing
one out from the rail entering the backstretch, set sail after the pacesetter two wide entering the final turn, and closed one out from the rail in the drive to
hold the place. ROOKIE YEAR settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the
final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to get up for a share, while gaining late. WISELY PLAYED settled well off the early pace while
racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid three out from the rail entering the final turn, and improved his position in the drive
while finishing five wide. GUNFIGHTER stumbled badly in the opening strides to get away poorly, settled well back while saving ground at the rail entering
the backstretch, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive. TAPITS CHOICE away well and
tracked the dueling leaders into the backside while racing one out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing
response when called upon. SHURAZ away alertly and pressed the pace from the outside of CURLIN ROCKS entering the first turn, forced the issue to
wide in the run to the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. NEIGHBOR broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving
ground at the rail, steadied sharply when put in tight quarters at the rail entering the final turn, and had little to offer thereafter. A stewards review into the
incident entering the final turn, resulted in no action being taken

ROSE OF TEXAS away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, continued
to save ground while maintaining her advantage into the final turn, and was all out to fend off a late surge by OSTRACIZE to prevail. OSTRACIZE settled off
the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched her bid four wide entering the final turn, and closed with a rush two out
from the rail in the drive to just miss. CARLA'S HONOR tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, shifted two wide in mid stretch and finished well to garner a share. ZETAMARIE away alertly, but was allowed to settle off the early
pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished with late interest
from along the inside in the drive while improving her position. LASTING LIGHT broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one
out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn while continuing to chase the pacesetter, but faded in the late stages. RICHARDS COMMAND
tracked the leader three wide entering the first turn, continued to track the leaders two out from the rail in the run down the backside and into the final turn,
but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. TIMELESS SHRUG unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and was
never a factor.

CERTIFIABLE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to dictated the pace in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, and held PINEAPPLE TIDBITS safely at bay late while finishing out from the rail. PINEAPPLE TIDBITS settled off the
early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, pulled her way into a stalking trip entering the backstretch, commenced her bid
from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the inside in the drive to prove clearly second best. AMANDA away alertly and
tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backstretch and into the final
turn, and finished evenly in the lane to garner a share. WALKINTHEWALK settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch
the first time, continued to bide her time near the back of the field in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and improved her
position over the final furlong. TEXAS HUMOR stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, loomed a danger while
moving up three wide approaching the final turn, but needed more late when called upon. ICE BREAKER stumbled badly in the opening strides and dropped
back to trail, was always well back and failed to make an impact. BAKZONE away well and stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail, continued
to save ground while in contention in the run down the backside, but weakened over the final furlong.
