OUR DETERMINATION was last away then rushed up to the front to take a pressured lead from SON CARLOS to the top of the stretch, edged away and
just lasted. LETMIKEFIGUREITOUT vied for the early lead from three wide then rated off the pace through the turn and made a rebid from three wide in the
stretch to just miss. GUTZY raced in the middle of the pace while saving ground through the turn then made a mild late gain in the stretch. COLT'S BRIM
raced near the back and passed tired one nearing the wire. SON CARLOS vied for the lead from two wide while matching strides with OUR
DETERNIMATION to the top of the stretch and tired. MAGIC LIGHTNING showed no speed and didn't make a bid.

Footnotes
RUN SMITTY RUN raced off the pace from between horses to the turn then was coaxed midway through the turn while gaining momentum, tipped out to
three wide in upper stretch and closed willingly to prove best. BIG FIG prompted the pace from two wide to the turn then moved up to engage the leader and
took a brief lead into the stretch but was overtaken while tiring but stayed on to be second best. LIFE ON THE NILE roused to the front to take a challenged
lead to mid turn but was collared near the quarter pole, weakened and was outfinished. WINMOR WENDY raced off the pace from the inside then moved
out to two wide in upper stretch and gave the late interest to improve position. PERFECT STRIKE broke well then raced off the pace from three wide to the
in the early stages then dropped back near the four furlong marker and passed tiring rivals in the stretch drive. COUNTRY CUT showed no early speed then
moved up from three wide on the turn and improved position. YES JACK was hustled along to vie for the lead from the inside to the half mile marker and
retreated. CROW'S NEST raced near the back while saving ground to no avail. COME ON COME ON stalked the pace from four wide to the three furlong
marker and gave way.

through the turn then made a three wide bid in upper stretch and held on for the show. PAPA FLEW BOMBERS raced near the back on the backstretch
then made a rail bid on the turn and kept on and just missed the show. BAY MOBILE trailed the field and passed tiring rivals. WINONESOON stalked the
pace from three wide to mid turn and lacked the late response.

YOUNG TUSCAN vied for the lead from two wide through the turn and took command at the top of the stretch and drew clear. SPRINGTOWN vied for lead
from three wide in the early going, then was off the pace and moved out to three wide in the upper stretch and gained on the leader but couldn't catch.
AFLEET ASCENT raced off the pace on the inside but lost action on the turn but made a rebid and was up for the show. PEPPER JACK trailed the field
early while making a rail trip through the turn, angled out to three wide at the sixteenth pole and passed tired rival. JAKE THE BAND MAN sprinted away
from the gate to a pressured lead but was overtaken at the top of the stretch and weakened. CREOLE CHARLIE raced near the back to the turn then made
a mild two wide bid on the turn and flattened out. DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE was forwardly placed from between horses but had to slightly steady into the turn
and dropped back. FORTY THREE raced in the middle of the pack from three wide to the turn and gave way.

A MILLION STARS raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved up on the turn and ran down the leader in the stretch to be up in the
final jumps. HOOSIER was last away from the starting gate then settled in the middle of the pack, made a two wide bid on the turn and tipped out to five
wide in upper stretch to make the late rally and just missed. G'S STORM prompted the pace from two wide down the backstretch then engaged the leader
on the turn and took the lead near the sixteenth pole but was nipped at the wire. JAMAICAN ME trailed the field to the top of the stretch then made a six
wide run in the stretch to finish strong. THEO D'OR was hustled between horses to vie for the lead from three wide then moved up to engage the leader on
the turn but lacked the late response. TWO B shot away from the gate to a clear lead to the three furlong marker then was challenged to the eighth pole but
was eclipsed and tired. SHADY GRADY raced near the back and was never a threat. PINK HIGGINS tracked the leaders from two wide to the three furlong
marker and retreated.
