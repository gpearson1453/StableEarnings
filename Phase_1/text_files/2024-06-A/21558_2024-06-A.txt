LITERARY stalked the pace inside, bid at the quarter pole, was blocked at the eighth pole, and rallied late under steady urging inside. SUPER STORMY
was unrushed early and rallied in the five path at the quarter pole to just miss. NOSHUGFORPOP pressed the pace in the three path, bid on the far turn, led
late but yielded. CITY SHACK had a mild late bid between rivals. LADY HELENA was bumped at the start, pressed the pace in the two path, bid on the far
turn and steadied late in tight quarters. AGENT stalked the pace in the three path but had no late bid. OROZIMBA broke inward, led inside to the eighth pole
and gave way. MISS TENA MARIE raced well back, was very wide at the quarter pole and was eased. THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED AN OBJECTION
LODGED BY THE RIDER OF LADY HELENA AGAINST NOSHUGFORPOP ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.
