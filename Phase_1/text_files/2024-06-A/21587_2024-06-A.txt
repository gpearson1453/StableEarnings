Footnotes
PURPLE SHIRT was allowed to settle early, advanced three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and closed well and drew away in the final
sixteenth to prove best under a drive. WICKED IRISHMAN set the pace two wide, then vied for the lead on the inside midway on the far turn, made a bid
leaving the turn to gain a short lead, but could not go with the winner in the final sixteenth while being clearly second best. FORECLOSURE was well placed
on the inside and fell back on the turn, then gained the show award. TEXTPECTATION was reserved early, came six wide into the lane and improved
position. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY tracked the pace on the outside, made a three wide bid on the far turn to vie for command but weakened in the lane.
TWIXTER tracked the pace three wide, made a bid to vie for the lead in between rivals by the five sixteenth marker but tired.

Footnotes
SECRET WISPER was away alertly and quickly clear to set the pace on the inside while clear, then drew out on the turn and then was ridden out to prove
best. ELL GRAY chased the winner three wide and came four wide off the bend and finished willingly to be clearly second best. AUNT JO was settled early,
inside on the turn and moved out in the lane but lacked the needed winning bid. FIREBALL EXPRESS was between rivals early, two to three wide on the
turn, came four wide off the bend and had a mild late rally. BRACCESCA was outrun early, three to four wide on the turn, came wide into the lane and had a
belated rally. MOONSHINE WARRIOR was settled early and on the inside but had no rally. AIKEN TO BELONG was reserved early on the inside and failed
to menace. BIONIC KAT was settled early on the outside and was three wide on the turn and weakened.

UP FOR IT was well rated on the inside behind the duel, eased out leaving the quarter pole, came four wide off the bend and made a bid to draw clear
under confident handling to prove best. CHALICE dueled for the lead three wide and made a bid in the lane but proved to be no match for the winner while
clearly second best. LITTLE LAMB CHOP dueled for the lead on the inside and faded in the final furlong, held show award. SMART SHERYL LEE chased
the pace and was three wide on the turn, came five wide off the bend and had no kick while just missing the show award. SEA SHANTY was reluctant to
load, then was off slowly, moved up two wide and was towards the inside on the turn but had no late rally. MUMMALICIOUS was settled early and three
wide and never threatened. CITY OF LONDON was settled on the inside and was no factor. FIRST FORAY was outrun while racing green.

BROKENHEARTED pressed the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to be clear by the quarter pole, then drew clear leaving the turn and held sway
late to prevail under a drive. BAG OF GOLD tracked the pace and was two wide on the turn, moved out and came four wide into the lane and rallied well but
was too late, clearly second best. SUNSHINE JOHNNY was off a step slow, advanced two to three wide on the turn and then was along for the show award.
LUCKY DOUBLE ZERO chased the pace on the inside and weakened. GOTTA HAVE HEART set a pressured pace on the inside and was headed and
passed on the turn and then faltered in the lane. UPTOWNJACOB BROWN failed to menace. LUKE'S IMAGINATION was off a step slow and was not a
