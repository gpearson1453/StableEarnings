Footnotes
AFLEET DIVA pressed the pace from between rivals down the backside, took the lead on the turn under pressure, took command turning for home and
drew off through the stretch. THEA'S THEME stalked the pace from tight quarters up the rail on the backstrech, settled just off the pacesetters while saving
ground on the turn and kept-on willingly to be second best. THROWBACK dueled on the lead from five wide to the turn, continued to press the winner while
maiking a threatening bid at the quarter pole and flattened out in the lane. RAISE YOUR GAME settled to trail the field while well within striking distance in a
comapct field, was set to a drive midway on the bend and showed late interest without having an impact. ANNA'S DREAM bobbled slightly leaving the gate,
moved up to duel on the lead from three wide between rivals, dropped back early in the turn and steadily faded.

Footnotes
BLAZE ON pressed the pace for a half mile when tipped out to the two path on the backstretch, assumed command on the turn, responded when
challenged nearing the quarter pole, wandered about in the stretch drive and held on late to prevail. GO MARGIE GO tracked the leaders for five-eighths
from the rail to be well placed, rallied on the turn to threaten turning for home, angled out in upper stretch to circle the erratic leader and finished willingly to
be gaining in deep stretch. LOVELY LIZA broke a step slow to be the trailer, continued at the rear of the field to the far turn and made a mild bid in the lane
to be along for the show. NINETYNINECARATS stalked the pace from three wide to contend into the final bend and lacked a closing response. FABULOUS
CANDY chased the pack into the far turn and never threatened when called upon. MISSY BOSS showed speed to lead for a half mile, weakened in the far
trun to drop to the back of the field in upper stretch and was injured nearing the sixteenth pole losing the rider and walked off. THE STEWARDS POSTED
AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN REGARDING MISSY BOSS AND UPON REVIEW MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
BOARDWALK FRIES tracked the leaders to the far turn, rallied three wide to take control turning for home and opened a clear advantage in mid-stretch to
prevail convincingly. HURRICANE BON stalked the pace from the rail down the backside, angled four wide on the far turn and finished willingly just holding
the place late in the lane. APRIL APRIL reserved off the pace to be mid-pack, made a steady advance to be rallying turning for home, angled off the heels of
the runner-up in upper stretch and was gaining late to just miss the place. CHAVETA unhurried early to be near the back of the field and rallied well through
traffic in the lane to be gaining late. ENCHANTMENT (FR) set the pace on a clear lead and weakened coming home. INSTPARTY was not a threat.
PROPER GRAMMAR had head turned when the gates opened ot be away slowly, trailed the field to the backstretch, rallied down the backside into striking
position, made a five wide bid on the turn to loom and flattened out in the stretch. MAXIMUM EMILY prompted the pace while racing rankly through the first
turn and came up empty on the far turn.

LANTERN'S CANDY tracked the leaders from the inside to the far turn, angled out four wide to rally to engage the leaders turning for home, dueled from the
outside through the lane and prevailed in deep stretch. MO TOUGH dueled on the lead from the rail the entire way, responded gamely through the lane and
was out-finished in deep stretch in a good effort. SULLIVAN STREET led into the first turn, settled to press the pace down the backside, exchanged the lead
with the runner-up several times, continued to battle from between rivals down the lane and weakened late while best of the rest. PARTY MONSTER slow
early to trail most of the way and passed tired rivals in the stretch. VINGATIVA chased the leaders into the turn and failed to menace lacking a closing rally.
VODKATINI broke a step tardy, ranged up five wide in the first turn to gain a stalking position, contended to the far turn and came up empty when called
upon steadily giving way.

BEWARE OF PRIDE tracked the pace to the turn, rallied four wide turning for home and had a good closing kick to be clear ath the wire. POPS HARPER
unhurried in the early going to be near the rear of the field and made a six wide belated bid in the lane to be up for the place. TAKETHEFIFTH slow early to
be the trailer and made a steady advance through traffic in the stretch to be gaining late. TO MY TASTE hustled up the inside to prompt the pace, well
placed saving ground on the turn, ducked into the stretch gap to lose focus in upper stretch and kept-on through the stretch. BOLD D'ORO reserved off the
pace to be mid-pack and made a milf bid int the lane without impact. FRATELLINO broke sharply to be clear leaving the gate, settled to stalk the pace to the
turn, rallied to take command on the bend and weakened late in the lane. OFFICE CORRUPTION flashed speed to be clear on the lead into the turn, battled
to mid-stretch and gave way late in the drive. CLINTON contended early on and dropped back through the field as a non-threat.

GUN RUNNIN' GAL stalked the pace from the fence to the far turn, angled to the five path at the head of the lane to engage the pacesetter in upper stretch
and pulled clear through the lane. LOVELY CHARM set the pace on a well rated, comfortable lead, responded on the turn to maintain the advantage, was
no match when challenged by the winner in upper stretch and kept-on in the lane to be second best. BY THE GLASS reserved off the pace in striking
distance from between rivals down the backside and rallied passed weaker coming home to be best of the rest. NAVANI chased the leaders to the far turn
from four wide, made a mild bid on the bend and flattened out. MISS AMAZING pressed the pace in the first turn, steadied off the leader entering the
backstretch, continued to prompt the pace to the far turn and gave way.

UNDERSTUDY KITTY tracked the leaders from the fence down the backside, gained ground on the far turn, waited behind pacesetters, tipped out at the
head of the stretch and pulled away down the lane. ELEVATED GAME set the pace while well rated, responded when called upon in the final turn, could not
go with the winner when engaged in upper stretch and kept-on willingly to be second best. MIDNIGHT AWARD stalked the pace throughout while well
placed from three wide, was set to a drive midway on the turn, could not gain on the top pair but kept trying through the lane to best of the rest. PAPPY'S
REVENGE pressed the pace through the far turn and weakened coming home. BLUE CREEK broke fine, dropped far back while very slow early to be the
distant trailer and showed some late interest gaining ground in the stretch. EXCITABLE BOY reserved off the pace and lacked a response when called
upon. MONEY IN MOTION unhurried early to be at the back of the main body of the field and had no closing kick.

Footnotes
DUTCH MILLS slow away from the gate, settled in well off the early pace, six wide pursuit around the bend, from the outside engaged the leader nearing the
furlong marker, and kicked clear through the wire. SIR MI TOLEE vied for the lead three wide into the turn, took clear control leaving the three eighths pole,
long sustained bid through the stretch, clearly second best today. LOOK SHARP saved ground into the turn, angled off the inside nearing the quarter pole,
put in a strong bid in upper stretch, and finished evenly late. GATTO BE PROUD vied from the start between runners, called on leaving the quarter pole,
leveled off along the inside. RALLY BOARD tracked the pace from the three path, put in his bid nearing the quarter pole, and was out kicked through the
wire. YAHOO OMAR stumbled at the start, vied for the lead along the inside, when called on around the bend came up empty. NIGHTSCAPE very slow into
stride, saved ground into the turn, and never threatened. PER RULING#2024-00607 FROM HISA, NIGHTSCAPE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 7th TO
UNPLACED DUE TO EXCESSIVE WHIP STRIKES.
