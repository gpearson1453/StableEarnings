Footnotes
ROUTE RUNNER tracked the pace along the inside, then was ridden along by the quarter pole and made a two wide bid off the bend and hit the front
nearing the furlong marker and was clear by the sixteenth marker and then held his barn mate safe late to prove best under a drive. DR KRINGLE was
settled early on the inside, then eased out on the turn and was three wide by the quarter pole while launching a rally, then closed well but could not get to
the winner while being second best. RIVETAGE was reserved early, inside on the far turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth marker and rallied well to gain
the show award. SMILE MON was bumped at the start, set the pace while clear on the inside, then shook clear on the far turn and then was headed leaving
the three sixteenth and faded in the final furlong, lost show award late. PATCH O'BRIEN bobbled slightly and broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start,
then chased the pace and was three to four wide on the far turn then weakened in the drive. EXPRESS LINE was off a step slow, then raced four wide on
the first turn and the backstretch, then had no response. EAST FROM WEST stalked the pace three to two wide and tired. PER RULING #ECM2024-205

HAPPYFLYER was away alertly to duel for the lead two wide, made a bid to gain a short lead by the quarter pole, then was clear by the furlong marker, dug
in gamely in the final furlong and held on to prove best under a strong drive. DEEPLY HIDDEN tracked the pace along the inside, moved out and made a
three wide bid off the bend and was slowly gaining thru the lane but could not get by the winner. COLONEL YORKE was settled early and was two wide on
the turn, remained towards the inside off the bend and angled out by the furlong marker and rallied. SUNNY MAGIC was allowed to settle early on the
inside, saved ground on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and rallied but needed more late. JERSEY TURNPIKE dueled for the lead on the
inside and faded gradually. XAVI chased the early pace three wide, then was three to four wide on the turn, came five wide off the turn and lugged in thru
the lane while having a mild rally, green. HERB ELIAS was off slowly, then rushed up three wide to stalk the pace on the turn but weakened in the drive.
DISCOMBOBULAATOR was reserved early, four wide on the turn and was not a threat. MORODER was outrun early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SEVEN FLAT tracked the pace on the outside, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, then continued on in the lane and wore down the leader late to
prove best under a drive. SUTHERLAND stalked the pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, was clear by the furlong marker and then drifted
out by the sixteenth marker and was caught late, second best. HUNTINGTON was rated early four to three wide, made a five wide bid by the quarter pole,
but flattened out in the lane, stayed on for the show award. DONTKISSDAMINISTER was allowed to settle early, two to three wide on the turn, came six
wide into the lane and improved position but needed more. CITY OF CLOUDS chased the pace and was two wide on the turn and weakened. BOBWHITE
BOBBY chased the pace on the inside and weakened. STIRDATPOT set the pace in the two path, then was in the two path to the inside on the far turn and
then gave way in the lane. CRIMINAL DEFENSE was void of early speed and failed to respond.

Footnotes
VESTURE vied for the early lead in between rivals, then went on to set the pace on the inside, then drew clear on the backstretch, then was given a
breather on the far turn and turned back a bid leaving the turn and drew out to prove much the best under a mild drive. FORT THOMAS was void of early
speed on the inside, moved out on the far turn and came widest into the lane and closed well to be clearly second best. DIVE BOMBER vied for the early
lead on the inside, then rated off the pace on the inside, moved out in the lane and got the show award late. SAN MARTIN vied for the early lead on the
outside, then tracked the pace and made a two wide bid off the turn but flattened out, lost show award late. DAILY GRIND was reserved early, four wide on
the turn and came five wide into the lane and improved position but had no late kick. AK SAR BEN DERBY was settled back early, four wide on the turn and
came six wide into the lane and had a belated rally. ACTING DEBUT was settled early, made a four wide run by the quarter pole but weakened in the lane.
TELESCOPIC broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, settled early and lacked a rally. HEART OF OSCAR chased the early pace two wide, then
dropped to the inside on the far turn and weakened. CURLIN GUNNER was reserved early, two wide by the quarter pole and was not a threat. COACH
CAMPBELL was bumped at the start, saved ground and never factored. ROYAL SALUTE chased the pace three wide and tired in the lane.

made a bid leaving the turn and edged away in the final sixteenth to prove best under right handed crop urging. BEELIEVE HER was away alertly to vie for
the lead on the inside, fought on to the wire but could not go with the winner late, second best. HIGH FASHION KATE was crushed at the break and had to
settle back, three wide on the turn and then finished well. ANSWER THE CALL vied for the lead three wide, then was in between rivals on the turn and

Footnotes
PRINCESS MADISON tracked the early pace from the outside four to three wide, then made a bid when ready in hand on the turn. floated out four to five
wide off the bend, then was given one pop right handed with the crop nearing the furlong marker and responded well and then was shown the crop with the
left hand and was geared down the final sixteenth to prove much the best. MUGEN prompted the pace two to three wide, then made a three to four wide bid
by the quarter pole, but proved to be no match for the winner while staying on to be second best. LIFE'S FOR LIVING chased the pace on the inside and
then moved out to be two wide leaving the quarter pole, finished willingly to best the rest. JOELMA was off a step slow, saved ground on the turn and moved
out in the lane to pass the tiring rivals. SHEZALITTLESTINKER broke awkwardly at the start, settled back and was three to four wide on the turn and had no
rally. SOCIAL AFFAIR set the pace on the inside and gave way. HARPER'S RIDE was off slowly and raced three wide on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
LOTSANDLOTSOFCANDY set the pace while in the two path, drew out leaving the turn and then drew off smartly to prove best under one right handed
reminder by the sixteenth marker to prove much the best. ENDLESS GLOW settled back early and then was climbing while two to three wide, moved out on
the turn to be three to four wide, came four wide off the bend and finished willingly to be clearly second best while no match to the winner. ELLEN JAY
stalked the pace from the inside and then tracked the front runner on the turn, cut the corner leaving the trun but came up empty in the drive, bested others.
WHERE'S THE WINE stalked the winner on the outside, three wide on the turn but weakened in the drive. FROM SCRATCH stalked the early pace from
between rivals, checked by the half mile marker and dropped back on the turn, came five wide off the turn and tired.
