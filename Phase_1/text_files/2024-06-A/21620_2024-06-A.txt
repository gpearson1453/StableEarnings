Footnotes
MY BUCKET LIST allowed to settle in the early running while never far back, tracked the moderate pace into the turn, loomed four wide nearing the quarter
marker then vied for the lead into upper stretch, took command and shook free at the furlong marker, kept to task into the final sixteenth and drew clear into
deep stretch. ALPHABETICAL ORDER bobbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, recovered to track the moderate early pace, advanced three wide
along the turn and vied for the lead at the quarter marker, met the bid of MY BUCKET LIST into upper stretch then lost ground to that rival at the furlong
pole, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and held well in the end for the place honors. DO IT FOR DAVE unhurried in the early
running, saved ground along the turn then angled out into upper stretch, closed into the final sixteenth, could not impact the leading pair into deep stretch
and outfinished ARTEMUS GORDON for third. ARTEMUS GORDON rated off of the moderate early pace, advanced approaching the turn and chased the
pace two wide and between runners along the bend, lost position at the quarter marker, ran in pursuit into the stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and
was outfinished for third. CATCHME AT THELAKE sent to establish the early lead, dictated terms while clear nearing the half-mile, set a contested pace into
the turn, was overtaken into upper stretch and faded in the drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at
the most accurate time.

Footnotes
RAMATHORN bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, rushed up in the early stages and stalked the pace outside of LAST BABY nearing the half-mile
marker, advanced into the turn and pressed LAST BABY approaching the quarter marker, battled that rival into the stretch then took a narrow lead at the
furlong marker, shook free into the final sixteenth and kicked clear in deep stretch. LAST BABY broke alertly and assumed early command, set a decent
early pace while well handled nearing the half-mile marker, showed the way into the turn while three then two wide, was pressed to the quarter pole and led
into upper stretch, was overtaken by RAMATHORN at the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and held well for
second in the late stages. ALPINE SERMON tracked the decent early pace from the inside, saved ground along the turn, shifted two wide into upper stretch
and ran evenly to the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth, offered a mild late rally and just missed for second, while holding safely for third.
REGAL REDWOOD prominent leaving the start, tracked the decent early pace from the inside, advanced two wide along the turn, ran in pursuit into the
stretch, could not muster a late response and was outfinished for the minor awards. MR BIG BUCKS lacked early speed, trailed into the turn and did not
factor in the stretch drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
STREET TIGER broke well and stalked the pace in the five path, was always traveling well then moved to challenge approaching the quarter pole, still wide,
gradually wore down MAGGIE'S FAYE passing the sixteenth pole and won clear in the end racing in the middle of the track. MAGGIE'S FAYE broke well
made the lead without much prompting, opened up to a clear lead racing in the three path to three-furlong marker, met the challenge of STREET TIGER at
the quarter pole, hung in under right handed urging, gave way grudgingly near the sixteenth pole but was well clear of the next horse. JUNIORS KITTY
broke well from the inside and was hustled for the lead but was unable to get even with MAGGIE'S FAYE chasing to the turn, went into a drive from the
three furlong marker, was unable to keep up with the top two down the stretch, but was able to hold third. TO BEVY'S lacked speed from the start, kept to
task, passed fellow trailer SWIFT NATALIE on the turn but could do no better than to chase the rest down the stretch. SWIFT NATALIE was outrun from the
break, came under a ride early, had one beat down the backstretch, lost position to that rival on the turn and had little to offer in the stretch. This race was
originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
STRETCH RUN was prominent away from the start, engaged with ELCONDOR and contested moderate fractions inside of that rival heading to the half-mile
marker, disputed the pace two wide into the turn, took command into upper stretch and kicked clear at the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final
sixteenth and maintained a clear lead to the wire to hold sway. TITOS WITH A TWIST took back off of the moderate early pace, raced two wide along the
turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, angled widest into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, finished well into the final sixteenth, was
able to cut into the winner's margin in deep stretch but could not reel that one in and was up in time for the place honors. MAGICISTHEMOONLITE hustled
away from the start, was forwardly placed in the early running, climbed while dodging kickback nearing the half-mile marker, chased from the outside
entering the turn and loomed four wide nearing the quarter pole, ran in pursuit into the stretch, could not keep pace with STRETCH RUN into the final
sixteenth, was outfinished for second in deep stretch and held safely at the wire for third. COUNT ASHER allowed to settle away from the start, tracked the
moderate pace from the inside heading to the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch drive and passed a tired rival in the final sixteenth.
ELCONDOR showed good speed away from the start, assumed early command and set a pressured pace heading to the half-mile marker, held a slim lead
into the turn and set the pace to the quarter marker while three wide, lost ground to STRETCH RUN into upper stretch, could not keep pace past the furlong
marker and tired in the late stages. NUESTRO ENGREIDO took back leaving the start, was allowed to settle while never far back in the early going, guided
three wide into the turn and did not factor in the stretch drive. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the
most accurate time.

Footnotes
ICONIC SKY away from the gate a half-step slowly, rushed up and was forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the decent pace to the turn and was
guided three wide to the quarter pole, was roused four wide into the stretch and chased QUEEN MOLOTOV nearing the furlong marker, surged past
mid-stretch, took command into the final sixteenth and held in a drive in deep stretch to prevail. QUEEN MOLOTOV broke alertly and assumed early
command, set a decent early pace while well handled nearing the half-mile marker, led into the turn and showed the way to the quarter marker while two
wide, drifted three wide into upper stretch and held foes at bay approaching the furlong pole, was overtaken by ICONIC SKY into the final sixteenth, was
outfinished in deep stretch and held for second at the wire. ELEGANT SWAY was forwardly placed away from the start, rated nicely off of the decent early
pace and tracked from the outside heading to the half-mile marker, went four wide into the turn and lost ground at the quarter marker, shifted to the inside
into upper stretch and advanced at the furlong pole, rallied into the final sixteenth and just missed for second at the finish, while just getting up for third.
HONORABLE GAL allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the turn and advanced nearing the quarter marker, chased two wide into the
stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, could not find the needed response into the final sixteenth, was outkicked in deep stretch and just missed for the
minor awards. LADY GREGORY took back off of the decent early pace, was guided three wide into the turn and lost position at the quarter marker, roused
four wide into the stretch and re-rallied at the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. SONOMA DREAMING away in good
order, chased the decent early pace from the outside, was guided four wide into the turn and lost ground at the quarter marker, ran in pursuit five wide into
the stretch, could not keep pace at the furlong marker and gave way. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive
at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SUPER ELLIE broke well and was content to sit off the slow pace being set by OUTRAGEOUS while traveling well under a hold, was let loose at the
seven-sixteenth pole, quickly assumed command, drifted out to the middle of the race track turning for home then pulled away under a strong hand ride to
win clear. YOUR ROYAL FLYNESS was shuffled back at the start when GEEJAYTEE came over and took the path, rushed up into contention when clear
but was caught three to four wide through the first turn, was content to track very wide down the backstretch, came into the stretch in the seven path then
shied when SUPER ELLIE drifted into the back then made light contact with ACCLAIMED PREACHER to the outside, kept to task and gained second with a
determined finish. ACCLAIMED PREACHER unhurried and was content to race near the rear of the field to the far turn, circled the field very wide on the last
turn to get into contention, came into the stretch in the eight path, took a light bump at the top of the stretch from YOUR ROYAL FLYNESS, finished well but
was unable to get past that foe in the late stages. OUTRAGEOUS won the race to the first turn and proceeded to set very slow fractions without much
pressure racing in the two to three path, ceded the lead to SUPER ELLIE near the seven-sixteenths marker then appeared to be weakening but found a
second wind a the top of the stretch and finished willingly under intermittent urging but came up short of a minor award. WARREN'S WILD RIDE raced in
the middle of the tight pack through the early stages, was trapped inside on the far turn then was unable to go on when the pace quickened, swung out to
the seven path looking for racing room but was outrun down the stretch. GEEJAYTEE broke in at the start and bothered YOUR ROYAL FLYNESS, then
was floated five wide into the first turn, then raced at the back of the compact field down the backstretch, was set down approaching the three furlong
marker, but could not overcome the slow fractions and was outrun the rest of the way. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
