pace, bid three wide on the turn, dueled into the stretch, gained a short lead, then was no match for the winner. TE AMO pulled in the early stages, settled
off the pace inside, angled out at the quarter pole, rallied mildly and got up for third. DESERT PASSION stalked close up two wide, bid between rivals on the
far turn, dueled and weakened. DELIGHTFUL AVA was fractious and then broke open the gate prior, then was bumped at the start, raced off the pace
inside, dropped back on the backstretch, moved up again on the far turn, came wide and gained some ground belatedly. SINGLEBERYLBOURBON raced
three wide early, then two wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and weakened. CHARLIZE CHUB set the pace on the inside, dueled on the

Footnotes
AMATTEROFTIME raced two wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch run, closed strongly in the final furlong,
collared NO CENTS in deep stretch and edged away for the win. NO CENTS rated the pace on the inside, vied briefly on the first turn, then took over,
showed the way into the far turn, briefly opened up midway on the turn, then dueled with GREAT NAVIGATOR into the stretch, dug in gamely to fend off
that rival, dueled with the winner and yielded. IRISH BOOLUM raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up four wide on the far turn, rallied mildly outside and
earned the show spot. GREAT NAVIGATOR tracked on the inside, advanced inside on the far turn, quickly moved up to challenge nearing the quarter pole,
rallied outside of NO CENTS into the stretch, dueled with that rival and weakened in the final sixteenth. IRISH MEADOW raced five wide on the first turn,
moved up three wide to contest the pace, then stalked outside, chased on the far turn and tired. LEMON CREEK LOUIE raced off the pace with an inside
trip and failed to threaten. LIB'S CONTENTO raced off the pace inside, steadied entering the first turn, settled off the pace, came three wide into the lane
and did not factor. KAZ SWEET HEIST raced four wide on the first turn, rushed up two wide to contest the pace, then stalked, chased on the far turn and
gave way.
