Footnotes
GALLAND DE BESOS rated nicely away from the start and settled in the early going, saved ground into the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch and
was full of run nearing the furlong marker, rallied while widest into the final sixteenth, took command in deep stretch and edged away for the win in the final
strides. COWBOY KISSES broke alertly and showed good speed away from the start, ceded the lead to GOLDENSUNRISE and stalked that rival through
quick fractions heading into the turn, attended to the fast pace nearing the quarter marker, advanced into the stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong
pole, took a narrow lead past mid-stretch, was overhauled by the winner in the late stages and held for second at the finish. REGAL PATRIOT tracked the
fast early pace from the outside, drifted to the five path along the bend, recovered nearing the top of the lane and chased three wide heading to the furlong
pole, was outkicked in deep stretch and outfinished GOLDENSUNRISE to secure the show honors. GOLDENSUNRISE sent to establish the early lead, set
fast fractions into the turn, dictated terms to the quarter marker and carved out rapid fractions nearing the quarter marker, came under pressure into the
stretch and was overtaken past the furlong marker, weakened in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for third. WESTERN CAPE lacked early speed,
saved ground into the turn and did not factor in the drive. CARDINAL TRICK unseated the rider prior to the start, bobbled at the break and was off a bit
slowly, was unhurried in the early going, raced two wide into the turn and did not threaten in the stretch. This race was originally hand timed and was
re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
RIVER RESERVE was hard to load prior to the start, was forwardly placed in the early running and tracked the pace from between rivals, was guided two to
three wide into the turn and tracked to the quarter pole, mounted a three to four wide rally into the stretch and came within aim at the furlong marker, took
command into the final sixteenth and drove clear in deep stretch, was pulled up on the gallop out and walked off under his own power. FAR OVER LOADED
tracked the moderate early pace three deep, shifted to the two path into the turn and tracked to the quarter marker, was roused into the stretch and loomed
nearing the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and outfinished NIJINSKY HALO to secure place honors at the
wire. NIJINSKY HALO broke alertly, showed good speed away from the start and controlled the pace heading into the turn, extended the lead while carving
moderate fractions nearing the quarter marker, led into the stretch and kept foes at bay nearing the furlong pole, was overtaken by the top pair into the final
sixteenth and held for third at the finish. MALA allowed to settle, was guided two to three wide into the turn, maintained a three wide trip into the stretch and
closed well in the late stages. NAVAL HARBOR lacked early speed, maintained a two wide path nearing the quarter marker, swung widest for the drive, and
found his best stride late. IT'S A FACTOR raced close up to the decent early pace, tracked from the inside heading into the turn, could not keep pace into
the stretch and tired in the drive. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate
time.

Footnotes
TERRY'S BOY rated nicely off of the fast early pace, saved ground into the turn, maintained an inside path into the stretch and was set down for the drive,
responded to urging past mid-stretch and loomed into the final sixteenth, shifted outside of BABY KRISTEN in deep stretch, overtook the runner-up in the
final strides and edged away for a determined win. BABY KRISTEN was sent to the early lead, showed good speed and drew clear heading to the turn,
carved out fast fractions while clear nearing the quarter marker, drew off into the stretch, began to tire a bit into the final sixteenth, was caught by the winner
in deep stretch and held for second at the finish. SIR GREYSON away in good order, tracked the quick early pace from outside of rivals, shifted to the inside
entering the turn and saved ground while in pursuit nearing the quarter pole, angled three wide into upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker while
lugging in a bit, closed well into the final sixteenth and missed for second, while holding clearly for third. EVENEREVENWORSE hopped at the start and
was off a step slowly, recovered and stalked the fast early pace outside of BABY KRISTEN, chased the pacesetter two wide into the turn and ran in pursuit
nearing the quarter pole, Rivera lost his crop at the furlong marker, could not muster the needed response into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. WAR
GAMES tracked the fast early pace three wide, was well placed into the turn and chased three wide to the quarter marker, was outkicked into upper stretch,
re-rallied in the late stages but needed more in the final sixteenth. TABLE FOR TEN took back off of the fast early pace, saved ground into the turn, was
gaining in the stretch drive but did not factor in the late stages. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology
to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
OUR BOLD PRINCE was forwardly placed leaving the start, was a bit keen in the early running and checked off of heels at the half-mile marker, raced close
up into the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole, tipped two wide for the drive and confronted THUNDER OF ZION nearing the furlong marker, took
command past mid-stretch and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. ESTABLISHED was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the early pace outside
of rivals heading to the half-mile marker, chased three to four wide into the turn, chased while widest into upper stretch, could not keep pace with the winner
into the final sixteenth and held for second at the finish. GRAZEN SUN took back off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn and trailed nearing
the quarter marker, ran in pursuit into the stretch and tipped two wide at the furlong marker, rallied into the final sixteenth and missed for second at the
finish, while getting up in time to secure the show honors. THUNDER OF ZION was prominent away from the start, assumed early command and set a
pressured pace to the half-mile marker, shook free into the turn and set moderate fractions nearing the quarter pole, led into upper stretch and came under
pressure at the furlong marker, was overtaken at mid-stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for the minor awards. GROSS PROFIT
broke alertly, vied for the early lead then ceded to THUNDER OF ZION and pressed that runner through moderate early fractions, chased two wide into the
turn, got caught between runners at the quarter pole and was shuffled back at that station, lost ground into the stretch and finished evenly in the drive.
COOL MOUNTAIN LAD allowed to settle away from the start, raced two wide into the turn and could not muster a response in the stretch drive. This race
had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
A CROWN FOR KITTEN was unhurried from the start, brought up the rear going into the first turn, bided time down the backstretch then launched a three to
four wide bid on the far turn, had trouble changing leads heading into the stretch, straightened out at the furlong marker then found best stride late and
surged for the win. AMANDA ROSE showed good speed from the break without really being asked and was first into the bend, met the challenges of
VANDALIA and TOPANTICIPATION (GB) passing the quarter pole then cut the corner and went a length clear, finished with good courage under steady
handling but could not hold off the winner. TOPANTICIPATION (GB) kept to the inside and was mid-pack through the early stages, made a menacing move
two to three wide near the quarter pole then lost some ground drifting a little wide on the last turn, put in a good late run in the final furlong but came up
short. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS tracked with the tracking group but was caught three wide, launched a three to four wide bid on the far turn, then got stuck
behind horses in the stretch as was not able to get clear the rest of the way. AIRKITA broke best but was outrun to the turn, raced between horses as part of
the tracking group for the first half-mile, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, produced a mild rally in the stretch but was not good enough.. TIZ MY
PRINCESS was last away then caught three wide on the clubhouse turn, continued four wide down the backstretch just behind the tracking trio, did not go
on when asked near the three furlong marker, and finished evenly passing one near the wire. VANDALIA was prompted to get forward position early and
was two wide just off the flank of AMANDA ROSE through the first turn, was content to stalk that foe down the backstretch then went to put more pressure
on heading into the far turn, pulled even approaching the quarter pole, was unable to sustain the bid, came under heavy pressure and faded in the final
eighth. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

DAD'S JUBILEE away in good order, engaged with THECHIEFHASTRICKS in the early going and pressed that rival nearing the half-mile marker, contested
the pace between runners into the turn, took command past the quarter marker and kicked clear heading to the furlong pole, met the bid of LISA'S DOCTOR
S into the final sixteenth, was all out to hold off his stablemate in deep stretch and lasted for a determined win at the wire. LISA'S DOCTOR S hopped at the
start and was off a step slowly, recovered and was well placed in the early going, tracked the pace two to three wide into the turn, advanced along the bend,
angled four wide into the stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, confronted his stablemate past mid-stretch and closed into the final sixteenth, drew to
even terms with DAD'S JUBILEE in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while holding clear of the rest for second. THIRSTY LOV settled off of the
moderate early pace, was guided two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, swung widest for the stretch drive, closed in the final sixteenth and was a
clear third. FRANK THE CAT was prominent away from the start, contested the early pace three deep nearing the half-mile marker, maintained a three wide
path into the turn and pressed the moderate pace nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked into the stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. SCIENCE
RULES settled off of the moderate early pace, saved ground into the turn, swung three wide for the stretch drive and could not muster a late response.
THECHIEFHASTRICKS sent to establish the early lead, assumed command and set a pressured pace nearing the half-mile marker, led into the turn and
showed the way while pressured heading to the quarter marker, was overtaken into upper stretch and faded in the drive. ALIBI TERHUNE broke a bit
awkwardly leaving the gate and was off slowly, lacked early speed, lost contact with the rest along the turn and did not have an impact.This race had a
timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

COUSIN RICHIE allowed to settle away from the start, saved ground into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run and saved all of the
ground into the far turn, had a perfect trip into the lane and loomed nearing the furlong marker, took command at mid-stretch and kicked clear into the final
sixteenth, kept to task while on the left lead in deep stretch and held safely for the win at the finish. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT off a step slowly leaving the start,
was unhurried in the early running and saved ground into the first turn, was content to trail heading to the half-mile marker, guided two to three wide along
the far turn, swung five wide for the stretch drive and advanced at the furlong marker, could not reel in the winner into the final sixteenth and won the nod for
second at the finish. CARDIFF CRACK allowed to settle in the early running, tracked the decent pace while not far back approaching the half-mile marker,
chased two to three wide into the far turn, angled six wide for the stretch drive and rallied at mid-stretch, could not make further headway into the final
sixteenth and just missed for second, while clear of the rest for third. WHERE IT'S AT was allowed to settle while never far back in the early running, saved
ground into the first turn, well placed through the backstretch run, was guided two wide into the far turn, shifted four wide into upper stretch and bid between
runners at the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and was outkicked in deep stretch. DRUIDIC away in good order, assumed early
command and set a prompted pace into the first turn, continued to be pressured into the backstretch run and set solid fractions nearing the half-mile marker,
led while under pressure into the far turn, drifted out a bit into upper stretch and was confronted by COUSIN RICHIE nearing the furlong marker, was
overtaken past mid-stretch and yielded in the final sixteenth. LAW ABIDING was prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace three wide into the
first turn, maintained an outside path into the backstretch run and prompted the solid pace nearing the half-mile marker, disputed the pace two to three wide
into the far turn and battled between rivals into the stretch, vied for the lead at the furlong marker, could not match strides into the final sixteenth and tired in
the late stages. SEA DOG broke alertly, contested the early pace from between rivals, maintained a two wide path while between runners into the
backstretch run then lost position nearing the half-mile pole, chased three to four wide into the far turn, could not muster a response in the stretch drive and
gave way. BALTHAZAR was forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the early pace from the outside and was guided four wide along the first turn,
contested the solid pace from the outside along the backstretch run, chased three to four wide into the far turn, was outrun into the stretch and weakened in
the final furlong.

Footnotes
ADELIE (IRE) settled inside early, always traveling well, was patiently ridden through the far turn, saving ground throughout, had to wait for room turning into
the stretch, slipped through a narrow opening in upper stretch, drew clear under steady handling and intermittent urging and won clear. MY YAMMY LADY
unhurried from the break, settled near the rear of the field far behind the dueling leaders, launched a bid going into the far turn, circled the field, came five
wide into the stretch, finished strong under steady handling and intermittent urging and just got up for the place. J AND M EXPRESS was allowed to settle
into stride from the break, raced near the head of the group far behind the pacesetters, went into a drive before the three furlong marker, made a bold move
three to four wide around the turn, came four wide into the stretch and finished well to join the blanket finish for the minor awards. DERRYGOOLIN broke
slow then rushed up to get forward position, tracked the dueling leaders from a few lengths back with a large gap back to the rest, advanced to challenge for
the lead near the quarter pole took a very brief lead in mid stretch, finished on good courage but lacked the needed finish in an otherwise good effort.
BRAND NEW DREAM lacked any early speed and lagged near the back of the field through the first half mile, launched a bid with about three furlongs to
run and was making up ground only to be blocked behind a wall of horses, lost momentum and all chance. TURA LURA broke well and hooked up with
SAREEHA (IRE) before the turn, alternately dueled and pressed that foe through very fast fractions, made a bid for the lead a the quarter also joined to the
outside by DERRYGOLIN just past the quarter pole but had nothing left for the stretch run. SAREEHA (IRE) sprinted to the front, was joined by TURA LURA
before the turn, dueled that foe through rapid fractions with the rider at first trying to temper the pace then committing to the lead, held sway to the far turn
then began to shorten strides turning for home and was not persevered with late when hopelessly beaten, and became the last horse to cross the finish line
to close out eighty four years of racing at Golden Gate Fields. GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.
