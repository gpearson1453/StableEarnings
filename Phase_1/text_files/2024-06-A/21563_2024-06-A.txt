XERCES rated nicely on the lead, turned back a challenge into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. UPTOWN CAT allowed to
settle, saved ground through the turns, angled four wide into the stretch, drifted in and closed well for the place. LADYS CHANT well placed and outside,
held position on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, then flattened the final furlong and held the show. LAST GLIMMER
stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not match strides
with that one, weakened and held a share. BELLA SKYE ran evenly for three quarters and had no stretch rally. ELLYMARIE tracked the pace pulling, saved
ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and faded.

the place. SECRET TREASURE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and flattened

share. STAYINYOURLANE stalked the pace from between, held position on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, lugged
in inside the furlong marker and faded. ABRAMS mid pack and outside, lost some ground three wide through the second turn, then had no stretch rally.

Footnotes
HOLD MY BEER BRO mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, angled four wide outside the leader, made a steady gain, dueled with that
one late and edged ahead. EXCLUSIVE ENTRY set the pace well off the rail, angled in and shook clear into the turn, drew off in the stretch, then dueled in
the late going and was outfinished. MAC'S CAT allowed to settle, angled out through the turn, came five wide into the stretch, steadied on heels, then
closed willingly to get up for the show. CHANGE THE HOUR well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, flattened and held a share. EMMA AT THE GATE well placed and outside, looped four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted
in and weakened. OVERTIME CHARLIE allowed to settle, looped four and five wide through the turn, came widest into the stretch and improved position.
NOT TODAY GOVERNOR mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted in and could not gain the final
furlong. MICHAELSHATRICK mid pack, looped up four and five wide through the turn, steadied on heels, angled out, then drifted in and faded. GRUIT
passed tiring rivals. BAD AS JOHN was never involved. COSMIC CONNECTION vied for the early lead on the outside, then faded through the turn.
