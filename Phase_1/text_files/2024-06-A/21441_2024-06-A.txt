Footnotes
WILDWOOD TRIPLE bumped with SLEEPY CAT shortly after the break, was forwardly placed early just off the inside, angled outside the latter to
commence her bid on the bend, moved clear for second upper stretch, took the lead with a sixteenth left and was drawing off. TOO MUCH TUESDAY well
placed from inside on the backstretch, angled out through the turn, came widest into the stretch and swept past TINA'S TAPIZAR for second deep stretch.
TINA'S TAPIZAR was quickly clear of the others, saved ground but wore down the final furlong. SLEEPY CAT was bumped by MISS KITTY PIE then
bumped with WILDWOOD TRIPLE a few strides later, advanced to prompt the pace outside TINA'S TAPIZAR but began to yield with two furlongs to go.
MISS KITTY PIE unwilling to load by herself, broke inward, bumping SLEEPY CAT once the race began and was always outrun.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT SOCIETY a step slow at the break, was hustled up to the lead from inside, moved clear on the turn, drifted out entering the lane, continued to
steadily drift out but kept DRAGONFLY KISSES at bay. DRAGONFLY KISSES pressed the early speed from outside, was three wide on the bend, lost
ground staying outside MIDNIGHT SOCIETY into the stretch, angled out as the latter came out going to the furlong marker, gradually drifted out on her own
the last eighth and came up short. STARSOVERPARADISE moved to the inside midway on the backstretch, jostled with GLITTER BOMB as she squeezed
through a narrow opening leaving the bend, moved clear for third upper stretch then finished evenly. SCRAPPY PATCH was soon well back, chased from
off the rail and was never a factor. GLITTER BOMB vied for the lead briefly outside MIDNIGHT SOCIETY, began to retreat two wide on the turn, angled in
some as the latter came out leaving the bend, jostled with STARSOVERPARADISE and steadily gave way. LIQUOR CAT broke well but steadily faded from
outside, was pulled up and walked off. The rider of STARSOVERPARADISE lodged an objection alleging interference from GLITTER BOMB leaving the
bend. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
BRUCE ATTACK shared the lead from inside on the backstretch, moved clear when allowed on the bend, began to wear down inside the last furlong, drifted
out late but held on. CUTADAY advanced from outside, lost ground four then five wide taking the turn, rallied through the stretch, was bumped nearing the
wire but got up for the place. DURANGO CHROME soon recovered from being bumped leaving the chute, was in contention just off the inside, did not keep
up through the bend, came again in the stretch, angled out deep stretch as BRUCE ATTACK came out, bumped with CUTADAY nearing the wire, his rider
lost his crop and he lost his battle for second. PLAY THE BLUES forwardly placed toward the outside, progressed three wide on the turn, drifted out upper
stretch, held a straight path in the late going but did not have enough left. CARNACK ON TOUR advanced three wide on the bend, tried to make his bid
between rivals in the lane but was forced to alter his path inward twice the final furlong. LELAND JOHN displayed early speed just outside BRUCRE
ATTACK, could not stay with that one on the turn and wore down between rivals the last eighth. KNUCKLE soon trailed, angled outside into the bend, was
widest into the stretch and lacked a significant response. LORD ZEKE crowded leaving the chute, bumped DURANGO CHROME, chased from off the rail
and failed to menace. HALF THE BATTLE in the second flight on the backstretch, gave way from between rivals on the turn. TAPIT IN was never a factor in
a ground-saving trip. The rider of CUTADAY lodged an objection alleging interference from BRUCE ATTACK deep stretch. After their review, the stewards
did not uphold that claim of foul.

RHODIUMS PRIDE urged to stay close early toward the outside, saved ground through the bend and gained second inside the last sixteenth. EMPTY
HOLSTER broke inward, bumping HIGHLY PERFECT, raced in the second flight from outside, moved clear for second just off the inside on the turn, drifted
out upper stretch, kept a straight path the last furlong but gradually wore down. HIGHLY PERFECT prominent just off the inside, checked and abruptly
altered out to avoid the stricken KEEP ARTTACKING into the turn then steadily faded. KEEP ATTACKING well placed inside, sustained an injury into the
bend, lost his rider, was humanely euthanized and vanned off.

Footnotes
LORD GRANTHAM encouraged between horses early, was forced out some midway on the backstretch, went for the lead just off the inside on the turn, lost
some ground staying outside the drifting SMOOTH ATTACK entering the lane and upper stretch but took the lead just inside the sixteenth marker and was
drawing off. INSIDE THE CIRCLE stalked the early speed from between horses, took the lead just outside SMOOTH ATTACK on the bend, moved clear
and had the rail in the stretch, did not have enough left inside the final furlong but was clearly second best. MINNESOTA MOON altered out midway on the
backstretch, brushing with LORD GRANTHAM, progressed just off the rail on the turn, altered out widest with two furlongs to go and drew away for third
inside the last eighth. DRAGGING MAIN well back early, picked up his pace just off the inside through the bend and passed between tired ones in the lane.
SMOOTH ATTACK was hustled to the lead, showed the way just off the inside, was challenged from outside into the turn, angled out after losing the lead
leaving the bend, drifted out upper stretch, held a straight path the last furlong but continued to fade. EIGHT MAY raced in contention toward the outside,
three to four wide through the turn then gave way for the drive. LORD SHAFTESBURY saved ground to no avail. TOWN CRIER broke a step slow and
inward, bumping LAGRUE, was steadied, advanced widest on the backstretch but began to yield three wide after three furlongs. LAGRUE prominent just off
the inside, faded along the rail on the bend, was eased deep stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
DIXIE PENNY prompted the pace just outside AWESOME BIRDIE, rallied in the stretch and took over with a sixteenth left. AWESOME BIRDIE was hustled
to vie for the lead inside rivals, moved clear after travelling the first eighth, floated out some leaving the turn and gradually wore down inside the final furlong.
CANTOO boxed in through the early going, started gradually angling out with a furlong to go and made up minor ground deep stretch. TORTUGA ISLAND
in contention early from outside, was three wide on the bend, fanned out to path five for the stretch run, gradually altered out to stay clear of CANTOO the
last eighth and altered in near the wire. TAPICITA chased from just off the inside, was widest taking the turn and failed to have a stretch bid. MIDNIGHT'S
GIRL waited slightly then made a small leap from the gate, chased from inside and began fading with three furlongs left.

Footnotes
SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY vied for the early lead off the rail but inside rivals, moved clear on the bend and stayed just off the inside, floated out to path three
into the lane, was challenged from inside the last eighth but dug in and kept FULL MAGAZINE at bay. FULL MAGAZINE in contention from inside,
progressed along the rail through the turn, loomed a serious threat inside SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY the final furlong, lacked the needed late kick but was
clearly second best. MAQAMAT chased from just off the inside, had the rail taking the bend, lodged a mild bid in the stretch and took over third just inside
the last sixteenth. SNOOZER was a step slow and a bit awkward at the break, bumped leaving the chute, chased from well off the inside, lost considerable
ground widest through the turn and made up minor ground deep stretch. SOUPER FORTUNE was three to four wide taking the bend, passed between
some tired ones and began to float out near the wire. STAR OF KODIAK prominent toward the outside, took over third while five wide on the turn but
flattened out the final furlong. SEMINOLE BEACH chased from inside, was steadied behind traffic with three furlongs to go, altered out slightly then
improved position two wide the last furlong without threatening. KARAYEL bumped SNOOZER leaving the chute, was an early contender between rivals,
failed to keep up three wide on the bend, angled out 6 wide for a clear path upper stretch, lacked a rally and was drifting out near the wire. JACK VAN
BERG pressed the early speed from between horses, began to yield some on the turn, was checked briefly when his path disappeared nearing the quarter
pole, swung out to path seven for the drive, continued to fade and was steadied behind KARAYEL in the final strides. FASTNFURIOUS broke alertly, was
soon disputing the pace from outside, did not stay with SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY on the bend and gave way three wide the final two furlongs.
