Footnotes
OVERANALYTICAL rated along the inside, shifted out four wide into the upper lane and finished well to rally up under strong pressure. CONNECTIQUE
tracked the early pace setters from the inside and kept on gamely to the wire racing three deep. KLIMTOMANIAC was shuffled back at the start, moved up
through the far turn, split rivals two deep near the sixteenth pole and finished gamely to the wire. CHECK ME OUT showed good early foot from the inside to
set the pace and faltered the final eighth of a mile. JACKSON D dropped back early on, raced six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the
drive. SINGLE SHOT bore out around the first turn, shifted in down the backstretch, was near the inside past the quarter pole and had no late rally. DOCE
DE LA NOCHE swung seven wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. KEV MAN stalked three deep and faded. DYNAMIC SUN was forced wide
around the first turn, lost ground down the backstretch and never threatened.

NATIVE STAR settled off the early going, made a four wide move around the far turn and finished well to prove best under strong handling. BOBBY BOY
tracked the leader from the inside down the backstretch, eased out a bit to race four wide into the upper stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. PUT IT
BACK DAVE was sent to a clear early lead and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. CHAOTIC JACK raced off the early going, made a three to two
wide bid through the drive and closed in mildly. APRIORITY AVENGER was forwardly placed early on and faded. VIKING LEGACY lost ground to race far
back and was eased up on in the stretch.

Footnotes
DUKE OF CARTHANIA raced off the early going, moved up three wide near the quarter pole and finished strongly to surge clear late racing five deep.
FORTUITY dropped back to race mid pack early on, made a four to three wide bid in the lane and rallied well for the place position. TODDCHERO set a
pressured early pace near the rail and weakened through the drive. PARROT HEAD raced two deep near the five sixteenths pole, angled out and moved up
to improve position. KENTUCKY GHOST stalked the pace from the outside of foes, raced four wide into the upper stretch, shifted in through the drive and
weakened. DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) pressed two deep from the outside of rival and faded. GET THEM JUSTIN clipped heels in the early stages, raced
three to four wide around the first turn and never was a factor. AUTUMNS STRONG MAN stalked the pace near the inside and faded.

Footnotes
SPECIAL NOTE checked at the start, hustled up to contention, raced three wide near the quarter pole and proved best under strong handling. KAT'S
PRINCESS pressed two deep, angled out a bit through the stretch drive and finished gamely to the wire. AMELIES DREAMER vied for the early lead from
the inside and gave way grudgingly to the top pair. REQUITE THE EFFORT raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. RAGAZZA
had an inside run and not enough in the drive. GLITZ AND GLAMOUR raced up close near the rail and weakened. PENNIES FOR PAULLA raced from the
far outside in the stretch and needed more. SHE'S THE SHERIFF was hustled three deep and lacked a bid. FIRST CLASS GIRL dropped back and showed
little.
