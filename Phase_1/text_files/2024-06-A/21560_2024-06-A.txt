GLORY DIA surged to lead on the turn shaking clear in upper stretch digging in late from the two path. ROMANTIC JEWEL chased through the turn
extending into upper stretch bidding gamely in the four path late. DEL MAR FLASH hustled along saved ground to lane, bidding gamely late on the inside.
GO STELLAIRE slow early rallied out of the turn closing in late three deep. COWGIRL KIMMIE hustled along lost ground to upper stretch finishing evenly.
MAVI was in tight at the break. SILVER STICK STAIR chased through the turn weakening in upper stretch. G MONEY LIV pressed the pace dueling through
the turn wearing out in upper stretch. LIGHT HEARTED played no factor. SUPER WILDCAT pressed through the turn wilting down the lane on the rail.
