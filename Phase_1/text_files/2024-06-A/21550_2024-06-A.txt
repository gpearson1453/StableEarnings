LAST DIAMOND led the way by a slim margin around the first turn then set a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied inside a duo around the final turn, cut
the corner and shook free at the head of the lane, led the way into the final furlong under firm handling and held late over fast gaining IMPECCABILITY.
IMPECCABILITY was allowed to settle out of the gate and remained unhurried around the first turn, trailed up the backstretch and continued in the back
saving ground around the final turn, shifted out five paths wide in upper stretch, rallied gamely but was too late to reach the winner. CAPTIVE AUDIENCE
raced four paths wide entering the first turn then sat up close three wide pressing the early pace, vied for the lead three deep around the final turn, could not
move on with eventual winner at the head of the lane, but ran on two wide and secured a share. DARYL'S BOLT rated off the top trio up the backstretch,
saved ground then shifted out four wide late on the far turn, given cue turning for home, raced in range in the stretch run but lacked the needed kick for
serious impact. PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL pressed the pace around the first turn and up the backstretch, vied between rivals around the final turn, could not
match strides at the head of the lane but stayed on then flattened late.

Footnotes
WESTERN TOURIST vied inside of ALIBI IKE for the run up the backstretch, continued to match strides around the turn, shook free entering the head of the
lane and held firm under steady encouragement. BARREL THIEF was well placed sitting just off the embattled top pair in the opening quarter, continued to
track rivals into the turn, picked up the tempo three wide leaving the quarter pole, then given cue at the head of the lane, hustled along in striking range but
had to settle for second best. ALIBI IKE vied outside of WESTERN TOURIST up the backstretch, continued to battle around the turn, could not move on
with eventual winner turning for home, stayed on to the furlong marker then flattened out. DA RINGO raced off the early pace, hustled along three wide into
the lane and lacked a needed rally. GO FOR IT raced off the clear top trio up the backstretch, was ridden along two wide into the stretch and never
threatened. BEAUTIFUL LIFE was off a step slow at the start, moved up along the inside while remaining off the early pace, saved ground into the lane and
had no response.

RAYS BIG DREAM vied inside of FLEETWOOD SMACK while holding a slight edge up the backstretch, dueled on equal terms around the turn, cut the
corner turning for home, grabbed a slim lead, dug in gamely along the inside, raced heads apart in final strides and prevailed. FLEETWOOD SMACK vied
outside of RAYS BIG DREAM with rival holding a slight edge up the backstretch, dueled for the lead around the turn, kept on gamely in striking distance into
the lane, edged up to race heads apart nearing the wire and just missed. PREACHER MAN SAM got pinched back at the start then quickly advanced into
contention, raced just off the top pair then edged up three wide to engage the rivals at the quarter pole, remained three deep in aim through the lane and
lacked the closing kick to get by. NICE ONE JULIO tracked the early pace along the inside, continued to ride the rail into the turn, angled out near the
quarter pole, hustled along two wide into upper stretch and ran on evenly. GUNPOWDER N' LEAD raced off the early pace, urged two to three wide late on
the turn and failed to respond. TACTICAL REBEL raced in the back, saved ground and never menaced. BAD BOY BRAWNY raced off the early pace,
chased three to four wide late on the turn and failed to reach contention.

TRIBAL SPIRIT raced in the back in the opening quarter, edged closer along the outside late on the turn, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied
gamely along the outside and finished clear. GLAMOROUS LIFE settled through early stages sitting well off the clear embattled duo, edged up closer two
wide late on the turn, spit foes in upper stretch, sustained bid, split foes again late, went to grab the late lead but got overtaken when the winner swept by.
AUNT NADINE tracked the clear top pair up the backstretch, moved up closer three wide near the quarter pole, roused three wide in upper stretch, steadily
edged closer and got nipped for place. TAP ME A TEXT rated along the outside through early stages, gained closer contention late on the turn, launched a
four wide bid entering the lane, sustained a steady bid but lacked the needed kick for serious impact. CANARY NATION raced off the early pace, hustled
along three wide into upper stretch and had a mild improve. GIRLS IN CHARGE vied outside of ARIA APERTA up the backstretch while racing clear over
the rest, shook free mid-way around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, held clear a furlong out then got swallowed up leaving the sixteenth pole.
ARIA APERTA vied inside of GIRLS IN CHARGE while racing clear over the rest, could not match strides mid-way around the turn then tired in the drive.

SHANIAH was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, advanced to engage IVY ABAD GIRKL mid-way around the turn, vied then shook clear at the
head of the lane, continued to lead the way two wide, drifted in a path late, urged left handed and held firm. DIAMOND OF EKATI tracked the pace along
the rail, tugged a bit and steadied near the half mile marker, lost some momentum, waited patiently along the inside around the turn, cut the corner and
launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, roused forward into close contention, tipped two wide late and had to settle for second best. BLOW SUM SMOKE
raced near midpack in early stages, picked up the tempo three wide near the quarter pole, came four paths wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and
cleared a share. CHROME RACER rated off the early pace, saved ground then angled out three wide late on the turn, ran on and had a mild improve. IVY
ABAD GIRL hustled up to take over the lead soon after the start, continued on top into the turn, took on the challenge of the eventual winner at the five
sixteenths pole, vied for the lead then failed to match strides at the head of the lane and gave way. BREW CASA raced in the back, swung five wide into the
lane and had no response. JACK'S PARTY GIRL chased two to three wide in the opening quarter then steadily weakened.
