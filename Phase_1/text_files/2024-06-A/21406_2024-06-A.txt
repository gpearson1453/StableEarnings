SIR FLATTER was void of early speed, rallied around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, assumed command past the eighth pole and inched away
under mild urging. NUMEROLOGIST stalked the pace, rallied on the turn, assumed command, led past the eighth pole and was outclosed. ARIMONY was
never far back, bid to get within striking distance, hung late and held safely for sohw. CLAVICHORD stalked the pace along the inside, got boxed in on the
turn and in the upper stretch and came up empty when clear. MOONLITE GRAHAM set the pace to the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
FREE AGAIN was unhurried early, rallied around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed willingly, got up late and won going away. RED PILL set
the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead, led to deep stretch and was outclosed to finish second best. AZTEC SUN was slow early, dropped inside on
the backstretch, bid along the rail on the turn and was along for show. BRANDYN raced mid pack, bid off the rail leaving the turn and had nothing left for the
drive. SHUDDER stalked the pace, rallied into the turn to loom a threat, fell back, swung wide, weakened and faded through the stretch. DINI DICE pressed
the pace along the inside, backed up on the turn and stopped.
