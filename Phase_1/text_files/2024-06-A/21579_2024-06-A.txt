RUN JALEN RUN stalked shifting outside of the top pair into the turn, ranged up to bid three deep turning for home, forged an advantage entering the lane
and drove clear in the final furlong. CAPITAL CONNECTION set the pace as an outer rival applied stern pressure, clung as a wider bidder joined the fray
approaching the lane, got headed by that one entering it, fought on through midstretch but was only second best. LEBOMBO leaned into an outer rival at
the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out three wide in upper stretch and ran on to claim show at the furlong grounds. RETURNED was
bumped by an inner rival and took back from crowded quarters between horses at the start, trailed in the three path, tipped in entering the lane and
improved position. GAGLIARDI took contact from an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the three path, shifted to the four path entering the lane
and failed to menace. ADRIFT prompted outside of the leader, vied between horses turning for home, but faded entering the lane and weakened between

Footnotes
TAMMY'S CRUISER stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, ranged up to bid entering the lane and drove clear in upper stretch. PAM PAM
was fractious in the starting gate necessitating backing out to reset, tracked in the four path and between horses, sustained her chase to gain place at the
furlong grounds and held. MOR HAPPY HOURS was restless in the starting gate, pursued from midpack in the five path, ran on willingly through the final
furlong but was denied place. ELODINE was brushed and forced inwardly at the start, prompted inside of the leader, chased into the turn, kept on off of the
rail flopping leads in the final furlong and edged fourth. TALAVERA showed the way, tucked to the inside approaching the turn, got headed by an outer
bidder entering upper stretch and faded. NOBLE BERNADETTE pursued from the three path and failed to factor. BLIND SPEED was antsy in the starting
gate, broke a step slow, lagged behind down the backstretch, then moved up inside of foes under no urging. CAUSE IMA ROSE broke in and brushed a foe
at the start, chased while off of the pace along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
NORISKIT NOBISCUIT stalked along the inside, chased the leader in upper stretch, ran on to offer a rail bid at the sixteenth pole, edged ahead shortly after
and held from his outer bidding stablemate at the wire. BROUGHTY FERRY tracked two wide, came under a drive chasing between horses around the far
turn, shifted out to the five path entering midstretch, rallied to bid outside of his leading stablemate nearing the wire but missed. I HAD THAT ONE TOO
saved ground off of the pace, then ran on in the two path to edged show in the closing stages. LADAN stalked in the four to three path, then sustained his
chase between horses in the late stages but needed more. NEW BEAT showed the way in the three to two path, held sway through midstretch while drifting
back to the three path, but was caught by an inner bidder leaving the sixteenth pole and weakened between horses late. FASTA LAVISTA BABY raced at
the rear two to three wide, swung out to the six path entering the lane and failed to factor. MALU tracked outside of rivals and from the five to four path, but
faded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
STEAMPUNK chased from midpack in the three path, split foes launching a rally in upper stretch and sustained progress to reel in the leader in the shadow
of the wire. ROSE ALABAMA vied two wide and between horses, then only inside of her outer counterpart around the turn, drew clear entering upper
stretch, held sway through midstretch but was worn down by an outer bidder in the closing stages. AVALON GIRL tracked in the two path, then between
horses turning for home, edged place in upper stretch, but was ouikicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds and ran on to prove best of the rest.
ROCKAWAY REEF raced at the rear two wide, then moved up to reach fourth at the wire. SO FAR SO GOOD brushed the inner stall door and broke half a
step slow, prompted along the inside before chasing around the turn, then lacked a bid and lost fourth at the wire. STAGFLATION saved ground off of the
pace, but to no avail. STREETS OF PARIS broke a beat slow, tugged forward between horses to vie three deep down the backstretch, then two wide while
remaining in the three path around the turn, but faded drifting to the four path entering the lane. WINE AND WAVES tracked from the four to five path and
tired.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT RISING pressed the leader while tugging in the bit in the three path around the first turn, vied before forging an advantage with three furlongs to
go, inched clear tucking to teh two path entering upper stretch and narrowly lasted from a late outer challenger at the wire. CLASSIC CATCH stalked along
the inside, awaited racing room behind foes around the far turn, altered out five wide entering midstretch, offered a late kick to produce a bid at the wire but
just came up short. WARRIOR JOHNY was bumped by an outer rival and put to crowded quarters among foes early on, tracked two wide and between
horses, awaited racing room in the three path around the far turn, forged between horses to take aim on the leader in midstretch, but needed more and got
outkicked for place late. SALUTE THE STARS brushed with an inner rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, got headed by an outer presser at the
three furlong pole, then kept on willingly. GIANT GAME tracked in the four path, was roused within striking range around the far turn, but gave way through
the lane. GASOLINE brushed with an outer rival upon leaving the gates, laid off of the pace along the inside and failed to factor. SUPER CORINTO (ARG)
took up and steadied hard when an outer rival shifted across his path early on, raced at the rear three wide and got outrun.

Footnotes
PURSUIT OF POWER broke in and hindered inner rivals at the start, tracked three wide and between horses, ranged up outside of the top pair and in the
four path entering the lane, sustained grinding progress to bid outside of the leader in the final furlong, sparked a duel flopping back to his left lead at the
sixteenth pole, took light contact while sparring through the late stages and narrowly prevailed. MACAW bumped with an inner rival at the start, prompted
outside of the leader and from the three path, forged an advantage entering the lane, dug in to brace for an outer challenge in the final furlong, leaned out
and brushed his counterpart while battling in the final sixteenth and just missed. TRUMPTASTIC stalked along the inside, pursued from the two path around
the turn, then willingly sustained a chase to edge show late. BERNIN HOT bumped with an outer rival leaving the gates, set the pace in the two path as an
outer rival applied strong pressure, got headed by that one at the quarter pole and yielded. ALWAYS BE SMART was bumped and put to tight quarters
between horses at the start, laid off of the pace in the two to three path and cut the gap on the leaders late. YELL COUNTY was forced inwardly while
transferring contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the start, trailed along the inside, shfited four wide into upper stretch and failed to menace. AZOI
broke a step slow, lacked speed in the four path before swinging to the seven path entering the lane, but failed to factor. BETTERA chased two wide and
between horses, then weakened. AVAILABILITY tracked four wide, but faded in the five path turning for home. THE RIDER OF MACAW CLAIMED FOUL
AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.
