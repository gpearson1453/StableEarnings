SPOT ON JOLEE stalked the pace from the fence through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch around the tiring pacesetter and kicked clear holding the closer
safe. KELROSIE unhurried for the first three-eighths, rallied on the turn with a steady advance and closed well through the stretch to be gaining late. MY
KIND OF NITE set the pace under mild early pressure, opened a clear advantage turning for home and tired in the lane. DESTIN TO BE GREAT slow early
to be the distant trailer to midway on the turn and mounted a good belated rally in the lane. SADIE MY LADY tracked the leaders through the turn to be well
placed and lacked a closing response when called upon. CRANBERRY CHILL showed brief speed to press the early pace and weakened. DISTORTED
ROSE broke alertly, was taken in hand to settle mid-pack and raced without imapct fading the lane.

CLASSY CITY unhurried in the early going to be the lone tracker, closed ground to the top of the lane, angled in to sneak up the fence when given the
opportunity and closed well up the fence to pull away in deep stretch. SKIPPER'S PRIDE stalked the pace from three wide down the backside, dueled from
between horses from midway on the turn to late in the lane, dug-in determinedly but was outkicked by the winner. MR FILLIP bumped leaving the gate,
raced two wide pressing the pace to the turn, battled from three wide between rivals through the turn, continued on down the lane and was out-finished late.
NOW N LATER GATOR set a pressured pace from the rail to upper stretch while under constant pressure, responded well to contend to inside the eighth
pole and weakened deep in the drive. ITSALLGOODMAN raced up down the backside to press the leaders from four wide and flattened out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MARAMAX pressed the pace through the turn, took command in upper stretch and finished in a determined drive despite weaving a bit late in the lane.
ASAMATTEROFFACTIDO tracked the leaders into the turn, angled to the rail saving ground on the bend, rallied up the fence until MISS MIEZIE dropped to
the rail, took up sharply to angle out and finished willingly. OOPS AND DOWNS reserved off the early pace, rallied five wide turning for home and steadily
advanced on the outside to gain the show. MISS MIEZIE set a pressured pace to the quarter pole, drifted two wide turning for home, dropped to the rail
impeding the runner-up in mid-stretch and weakened through the drive. JODEYS LIL PAIN went evenly without impact. KULSUM slow early to be well back
of the pack and was never a threat. SILKSTONE chased the leaders from five wide into the turn and faded.

AMEER reserved off the pace while saving ground through the turn, tipped out three wide at the head of the lane, closed well down the stretch, dueled with
the runner up for the final eighth and prevailed at the wire. MACHINE stalked the pace through the turn, rallied four wide down the lane, battled with the
winner to the wire and was denied in a good effort. WRONG SPOT broke a step slow, trailed for a half and finished well with a belated bid.
INDEPENDENCE NEIGH pressed the pace to the turn, took the lead on the bend and flattened out in the drive. PERPETUAL BLISS failed to menace.
OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR was not a threat. CARRERA CABALLO set a pressured pace to midway on the turn and came up empty.

passed weakened rivals in the lane. MISS MCBRIDE raced mid-pack, was called upon under a drive in the turn and lacked a response. WISH ON A STAR

Footnotes
SAWCHUK tracked the leaders through the turn, rallied five wide turning for home to engage the pacesetter in deep stretch, drifted in a bit down the lane
and finished best of all. TENNESSEE MOSES sped off to the set the pace, opened a clear lead on the turn, widened in upper stretch, drifted out while tiring
late in the lane and held the palce. CAPE'S LEGACY was well placed in striking distance through the turn while saving ground, rallied from the inside down
the lane, angled out to the two path and was held up in traffic late when the runner-up drifted out and the winner came in slightly. THISCATSGOTSPEED
reserved in mid-pack through the bend and made a late rally to hit the board. J J'S CAPER prompted the pace to upper stretch and finsihed evenly lacking a
closing rally. E PAY ALL THE WAY went one-paced. SILVER TIP trailed to the head of the lane and passed tiring rivals. SUNNY WAY was not a threat.
FULL MEASURE dropped to the rear of the field having never menaced. THE TRAINER OF CAPE'S LEGACY CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE IN
THE STRETCH RUN, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
WEDGE POND flashed early speed to take a clear lead, dropped to the rail, set a pressured pace to the top of the lane, edged away from all challengers
and held them safe through the lane. BROWNING ISLAND unhurried in the early going, rallied on the turn splitting rivals, angled further out to the six path in
the lane and closed well to be up for the place. COOLCROSS tracked the leaders through the turn in the clear, rallied in upper stretch from between rivals
and finished willingly to just miss the place. DON'T STOP DREAMIN saved ground through the turn while reserved in mid-pack, cut the corner turning for
home and rallied well up the fence to just miss. MOB BOSS stalked the pace to the turn, circled three wide to duel on the lead, kept-on through the lane,
rider lost the crop at the eighth pole and leveled off to finsih evenly. PUMP THE BRAKES pressed the pace to the quarter pole from between rivals and
faded in the lane. DUNE D'ORO failed to menace. WYE CROSS trailed most of the way and passed tiring rivals late. A LATE ONE was not a threat.
SMASH FACTOR dropped to the back of the field having not been a factor.
