on the turn then rallied in the stretch to get up for the place position in the end. BLAKE'S SONG broke inwardly then hustled to set the pace along the rail,
was confronted by an outer leaving the bend, was over taken for the lead and flattened out in the lane. TEXAS KISS chased the pace while two wide into
the turn was in a mild drive heading into the stretch and came up empty in the end. WICKED LIL SISTAH chased the pace briefly along the rail then

BOBBY BRINKLEY bid for the lead early, then settled back along the rail between packs and remained nicely rated, then dug in gamely leaving the bend
and was in an all out charge down the lane and was in time to prevail. VIETNAM VICTORY pressed the pace from the inside, then took command at the half
pole and into the turn, was in a long drive in the late stretch then was caught at the wire and was second best. BLING MOUNTAIN pressed the pace while
three wide leaving the backstretch, then rallied on the turn in attempt to over power the leader, lacked the winning bid and gave way in the stretch and
maintained the show prize in the end. CHAMPAGNE STOOPER was allowed to settle at the back while two wide, then came out three wide leaving the turn
and rallied mildly in the stretch to no avail in the end. MISTER MONTE CARLO was off slow and no threat. MY GOLDEN M set the pace while two wide
early, was overtaken by an inner foe heading into the second half, continued to press the leader on the turn while in a hard drive, could not retain bid and

FAST TRACK broke outwardly, then prompted the pace while two wide, remained nicely rated on the turn close being the leader, then dug in gamely in the
stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. BLING IT TO ME showed the way from the inside into the turn, was in a long drive in the stretch then was
out finished by FAST TRACK in the end. THE NEXT BIG BLING raced from the inside in the middle of the pack at a moderate pace throughout the early
furlongs then closed well down the lane to claim the show prize in the end. GEE SHE'S FANCY trailed at the back early, then rallied along the rail leaving
the turn but it was too little too late in the end. TOO MUCH DREAMING was impeded at the start, was unhurried early, fanned out five wide leaving the turn
to rally mildly in the stretch and came up empty. CREAM PUFF REAPER chased the pace while two wide into the turn, came out four wide to bid in the
upper stretch and came up empty in the end. SHE'S EXTRA pressed the pace while three wide and in a hard drive into the turn, was used up and tired in
the stretch.

three wide into the turn, then dueled with MIDNIGHT HUMOR heading into the upper stretch, was outkicked by said rival then was out finished for the place
position in the end. OARSMAN moved up to vie between rivals into the turn, could not retain bid on the turn and flattened out in the stretch. TOO MUCH
SPEED chased the pace from the inside, then settled back on the turn, rebid in the upper stretch, was bumped by drifting foe and made no impact in the
end. BRODY'S TREASURE veered inwardly at the start and was no factor. CLEVER IT chased the pace while three wide into the turn, drifted inward and
bumped rival and was no threat in the end. BARTOLOME was impeded at the start, then chased the pace while two wide in the second flight of rivals and
did not fire in the final quarter.

MARQUEE LADY stalked the pace while three wide down the first half of the course, then inched up to gain second position on the turn, met with the pace
setter in the upper stretch to duel briefly while brushing, then kicked clear in the final yards to prove best in the end. WEC KEAH broke outwardly then set
the pace from the inside, was challenged by an outer foe leaving the turn, was brushed by said foe while in a gamely duel in the late stretch then was out
finished in the end. MI SONRISA pursued the pace from the inside towards the front, then steadied at the top of the turn, regained stride to re bid along the
rail in the upper stretch, was brushed by an outer foe in the final yards and finished well for the show prize. CONTRABBANDA raced mid pack while two
wide, urged steadily on the turn to gain third position, rallied in the early stretch, brushed inner foe then gave way in the end. C W CHARM was allowed to
settle while two wide then bid mildly in the late stretch and came up empty. ROYAL LIAISON was off slowly then rallied too little too late in the end.
DELPHINE raced at the back of the pack, then swung five wide leaving the bend and came up empty in the end. LADY ATHENA was allowed to settle
outside of foes while three wide, rallied mildly in the stretch and was no threat. WHAT A RIDE stalked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, angled
in a long the rail to bid on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. MORO PRINCESS raced in the middle of the pack along the rail and failed to respond.
UNCLE SHORTYS GIRL was no menace.

Footnotes
UNDER OATH prompted the pace from the inside, remained well rated close behind the leaders on the turn, then shifted out to the four path, dug in
aggressively between rivals and was up in the final strides to prevail. ZE'BUL broke slightly inwards at the start, was allowed to settle towards the back while
two wide, then moved up on the turn to vie with inner rivals, continued to rally gamely down the lane and was out finished in the end and was second best.
BOUGIE JOE pressed the pace from the two path, then steadied slightly at the half pole, rebid on the turn to battle between rivals at the quarter pole, took
command briefly in the upper stretch then was out finished in the end and held the show position. SEND THE BOSS was allowed to settle along the rail
towards the back of the pack, then came out six wide leaving the turn and rallied mildly in the stretch but it was not enough in the end. BLOCKED set the
pace while two wide, maintained the lead while in a steady drive heading into the turn, then battled with outer foes before giving way in the stretch. GOLD
BARON pressed the pace while four wide in the early furlongs, then inched up on the turn to battle for the lead between rivals, was used up and weakened
in the stretch. CAPTAIN JACK pressed the pace while three wide down the backstretch, continued to urge eagerly on turn before flattening out in the
stretch.
