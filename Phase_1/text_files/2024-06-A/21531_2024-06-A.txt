strong handling. SWELTER never far back, dug in through deep stretch four wide and just missed. CUMBER vied for the lead along the inside, shifted to the
three path and finished well between horses. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE prompted the pace two then three wide and finished determinedly. CAMBIASO
trailed early, offered a strong bid along the rail into the stretch then was outfinished. SAY HEY KID was no factor. CANDY CRUSHEM was no threat.
ALGORIX stalked the pace three wide into the far turn then weakened. TUFF ATTACK with the second flight three wide, was through after a half.

Footnotes
MIGHTY LES stumbled at the start, recovered to chase the lead, surged under strong handling through deep stretch and got up in the final strides.
FLAWLESS CAT away alertly, set the pace with a clear advantage, widened on the turn then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. SHORTLY had
good early speed three wide, dropped back on the turn while two wide, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch then came on again late. EL BAMBINO
found his best stride late four wide. C C'S CLEAR CREEK was bumped at the start, drifted in bumping OUTS JAIL ON BAIL near the nine sixteenths pole,
offered a strong bid along the rail into the stretch then leveled off. SIR broke outward bumping C C'S CLEAR CREEK at the start and was no factor.
MARSICO was no threat. OUTA JAIL ON BAIL was bumped while along the rail near the nine sixteenths pole causing his rider to check hard, lost action for
a few strides then was never involved.

RIGHT TRAPPE broke in front, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and won as much the best while being ridden out. ALSANAH unhurried early,
saved ground, shifted out three wide near the quarter pole, rallied through the stretch and finished clear for second. VILLAGE QUEEN with the second flight
two wide, failed to respond. JEN'S BATTLE with the second flight three wide, went evenly. CALENDULA was fractious in the gate, unprepared for the start,
had her head turned, reared, was never involved and declared non starter. MISS OVER THERE pressured the winner two wide and was through after a
half. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER VIDEO REVIEW DECLARED CALENDUL A NON STARTER.

MR LAOBAN allowed to settle, rallied four wide through the far turn to make the lead past the quarter pole, turned back a strong bid from the runner up in
mid stretch and proved best in a game effort under strong handling. HOUSED vied for the lead along the inside for six furlongs, altered course to the five
path at the top of the stretch, bid outside the winner near the furlong marker and was denied. GRAND DEAL slow early, passed tiring rivals through the
stretch in the middle of the racetrack. SMALL SAILOR set the pace two wide for six furlongs and gave way in the final furlong. STEP AHEAD had speed
from the start, inched closer four wide after a half then came up empty. CAPTURE MI stalked the pace three wide and was through after a half. JOYFUL
CANDY was through early.

ROLL A QUARTERS broke in full stride to set all the pace, widened into the stretch and won in hand. TADZIO chased the winner two wide and finished
clear for second. A PRAYER FOR KIDS trailed for a half then had a mild rally late three wide. SADIE'S SILVER KID close up three wide, failed to respond.
KINGDOM DIAMOND failed to menace. LINO'S KID had good early speed inside and was through after a half.
