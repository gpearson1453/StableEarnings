Footnotes
KETONIA (FR) was a bit keen stalking from inside behind PACE LANE then surged clear late on the clubhouse turn, pressured by that rival up the
backstretch, maintained command through the far turn, shook free at the top of the lane and held late under a strong drive. O K ROSE stalked two then
three wide around the first turn, chased off the pace up the backstretch, gained a bit off the rail through the far turn, angled in a sixteenth out and showed
late effort but could not get by the winner. PACE LANE took control from inside then moved into the two path on the first turn before ceding command to
KETONIA (FR) and chased that rival into the backstretch, applied pressure from outside in the middle stages and far turn, lost touch with the winner at the
top of the lane and weakened in the furlong grounds. STARLIT HARBOR pulled outside rivals prior to the first turn, chased three then four wide around the
bend, fell far back off the pace in the middle stages, saved ground through the far turn and failed to menace. IN WITHOUT KNOCKIN moved to the inside
trailing early, lagged far back up the backstretch, continued at the back while off the rail through the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
DANCING DANA dueled inside ZZYZX to the five-sixteenths pole, put that rival away with a quarter mile remaining and stayed clear under right handed
urging and steady handling. TAPIT DOUX stalked from outside, roused three wide on the turn, took aim under left handed urging in upper stretch but had to
settle for second best. DANCE KID bobbled slightly leaving the gate but still broke with the field, chased the top pair from inside, hugged the rail to the
stretch and lacked a bid. ZZYZX dueled for the lead from outside, could not kick on with the winner approaching the quarter pole and weakened in the
furlong grounds.

Footnotes
DIAMONDS DANZING cleared and crossed over early, opened up a large lead on the backstretch, held a diminishing lead around the far turn and into the
stretch, put to right handed urging then switched to the left hand in the final furlong and remained unchallenged to the wire. FAYETTE FOX stalked the lone
leader from inside, drew closer around the far turn on the rail then tipped out late on the bend, chased within striking distance with a furlong remaining but
could not make any headway on the winner in deep stretch while finishing a clear second. LISA'S NONNO chased three then two wide around the first turn,
two then three wide on the second bend and lacked the needed response when asked. PROFESSORS' PRIDE hopped at the start to break a bit slow,
started to climb approaching the clubhouse turn, chased two wide around that bend, moved out in the middle stages, roused four then three wide on the far
turn and failed to menace. CONTROL FUNCTION brushed the gate but still came away well, reserved early four then three wide, trailed three wide into the
far turn, angled to the rail around the bend and could not rally. BANGS chased along the four path early, five wide leaving the backstretch, moved into the
three path around the far turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
LOGON TO WIN away quickest from the gate, showed early speed then ceded command to outer rivals, stalked two to three wide into the stretch, collared
the leader at the eighth pole, put a head in front a sixteenth out and remained strong to the line. QUEEN'S CODE vied three deep briefly then dueled from
outside up the backstretch, fought two wide through the turn, put away inner rival entering the stretch, challenged by LOGON TO WIN with a furlong
remaining, lost command outside the sixteenth pole and kept on gamely to the wire. VEGAS BURNER tracked the pace off the rail, rounded the bend three
deep, tipped four wide into the stretch and weakened. WESTPORT CAPTAIN drifted out and brushed rival crossing over the dirt, settled off the pace, made
progress on the inside through the turn but flattened in the late stages. LORD TRIPPING showed speed between rivals then dueled from inside, asked to
keep up with outer rival around the turn, could not match strides with the leader into the stretch and weakened. LEWIS BERE (FR) broke a few lengths slow,
got brushed by inner rival crossing the dirt, chased between foes on the turn and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
DICK BEST dueled briefly along the rail then took control around the clubhouse turn, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, disposed of
CATMANSUE at the five-sixteenths pole, inched away late on the bend, then drew off when put to right handed urging in the lane. SPEED GRAZY settled
along the rail, drew closer on the backstretch, took the second turn two wide, could not cut into the lead of the winner and churned on to hold second. DARK
MARCUS tracked two then three wide on the first turn, navigated the second turn four wide, kept trying down the lane and missed second. CALIFORNIA
BAY chased three then four deep early, remained wide through the second bend, spun five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. CRYPTO RIDE
bobbled slightly at the start, tracked from the two path, sat off the pace in the middle stages, saved ground through the far turn and failed to rally.
CATMANSUE dueled into the first turn then pressed from outside, flanked the leader leaving the backstretch, lost touch at the five-sixteenths pole and
chased two into the lane, then weakened in the final furlong. LIL NAS stumbled leaving the gate, recovered and showed speed under coaxing between
rivals but got put in tight and lost his path, stalked two to three wide around the first turn, lost ground in the three path on the second bend and tired in the
stretch.

Footnotes
ITZEL sped clear quickly, drew away along the rail on the turn, padded the lead in upper stretch and held safely under right handed encouragement. JUST
NAILS tracked two wide into the turn, tipped out but ran into traffic briefly behind a rival at the quarter pole, tipped out in the lane and finished willingly to
gain second and whittle the gap on the winner. ADAAY IN ASIA (GB) sat off the pace early, went three wide into the turn, angled down to the rail around the
bend, kept trying along the fence but got outclosed for second. SHANGRILAMA (IRE) tracked three wide into the turn, got moved out to the four path
approaching the quarter pole, came back in and chased two wide into the lane, steered out in the drive and showed a mild response to earn minor placing.
HALFWAY TO NOWHERE stalked the pace along the rail inside a rival to the stretch, moved off the fence in drive and weakened. CHARM YOUR WORLD
hard to load into the gate, chased two wide off the pace leaving the backstretch, moved out in the lane and failed to threaten. IRRESISTIBLE FORCE
stalked the winner outside a rival to the lane and weakened. MOCHA GRANDE trailed up the backstretch and moved inside, tipped three wide around the
bend and could not make an impact. MAGIC TIP broke a step slow, settled inside, cut the corner into the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
CHISMOSA lacked early speed racing inside a rival, went two wide into the turn, made progress under a ride on the turn, asked left handed and angled four
wide past the quarter pole, closed in and took aim at the top pair entering the final furlong, headed the runner-up at the sixteenth pole and drove clear.
RICHI (CHI) prompted the pace from outside then vied three deep past the half-mile pole, dueled outside TOM'S REGRET around the bend, battled with
that rival to midstretch, confronted by CHISMOSA on the outside with a sixteenth remaining, yielded to that rival and kept on to secure second. TOM'S
REGRET set the pace early while under pressure then dueled past the half-mile pole, fought inside RICHI (CHI) through the turn, lost command in upper
stretch and stayed on well from the fence for the show honors. ANYWHO chased the top pair for a bit then went up to press between rivals at the half-mile
pole, could not keep up with the leaders early on the turn and gave chase again two to three wide, churned on down the lane and earned a minor award.
OUTSIDE THE LAW stalked the behind the leaders on the inside, lost ground and chased out of range a bit off the rail into the stretch, then weakened in the
furlong grounds. DELITEFULL HART raced outside the winner at the back early, trailed three then two wide around the bend and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SASSY PRANCELOT stalked off the rail then outside a rival, drifted a bit at the three-eighths pole but was quickly corrected, took aim three wide into the
lane, surged to the front at the eighth and kicked clear while drifting to the inside in the final furlong. LOVELY IDAHO set the pace early under pressure from
outer rival, cleared late on the bend, lost command at the eighth pole and held second. JANE KENDEIGH chased from off the pace and moved inside, drew
closer up the backstretch, steadied behind a rival approaching the five-sixteenths pole, stayed along the fence to the lane, drifted in slightly and was
corrected with the left hand, then went on to gain the show. MOONLIGHT TRYST forced the pace from outside, chased after the leader past the
five-sixteenths pole from the two path, then flattened to fourth in the furlong grounds. R B'S TIGER dropped back early, passed a rival on the turn while
saving ground, showed a mild response in the lane and improved position through the stretch. DANZIG TIL DAWN bobbled leaving the gate, tracked
between rivals then two wide into the turn, moved out in the lane and failed to rally. SMILING FOREVER broke a step slow, chased from inside, drifted out a
bit at the three-eighths pole and had to take hold, came back to the inside, moved out in upper stretch and weakened. TRULY MAGICAL bobbled crossing
from the dirt back onto the turf, chased off the pace along the rail into the turn, eased out to the three path around the bend and lacked further response.
ROUND IN CIRCLES traveled in mid-pack off the rail up the backstretch, raced three to four wide near the back on the turn and failed to menace. SPICY
RIDE had her path taken by ROUND IN CIRCLES early, ran up on the heels of ROUND IN CIRCLES and had to take hold, fell back to last around the turn
and was never a factor.
