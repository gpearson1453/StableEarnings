Footnotes
CABOCHON TREASURE was off and racing mid pack in the five path, improved position through the turn while racing the widest of all, was asked in the
upper stretch, responded well out finishing the rest and getting up for the win. EL DEAL ME ACES raced mid pack four wide, tracked the leaders through the
turn, angled in towards the rail, improved position, found wide open space along the rail and quickly jumped on it entering the stretch, gained ground and
momentum, took advantage and closed well getting up for second. BACK BAYOU stalked the speed at first, then rushed up along the rail to challenge for
the lead, was on the lead and setting the fractions as a set with another rival through the turn, failed to navigate the turn and drifted out entering the upper
stretch giving up positioning and ground and had no late kick to take back what was lost and settled for third. OCEOLA stalked the pace from the two path
and raced in between rivals, shifted into the six path and challenged for the lead through the turn, was in contention before flattening out in the stretch
finishing flat. R T'S WILDCAT vied for the lead while racing in the seven path, raced in a stalking position down the back side, moved after the three eighths
pole and challenged for the lead then battled with two other rivals briefly before tiring. HEZA SEXY ZONG was off a bit slow, raced two wide, saved ground
but to no avail. HUFFS TAZ A BOO shuffled back early, trailed while racing five wide, made one run but did not have enough to get involved.

KEYS INCLUDED settled in hand away from the gate to be mid-pack, steadily gained ground up the rail to midway on the turn, angled to the three path at
the quarter pole, split rivals in upper stretch and drew off down the lane. TURN ON THE MAGIC reserved off the pace, rallied on the turn to be eight wide
coming home and finsihed well to gain the place. B W P SPIRIT pressed the pace from two wide to upper stretch and drifted out through the lane while
tiring. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE hustled up the fence to take the lead, dueled to the head of the lane and could not sustain the bid down the stretch. GOLDEN
PALACE stalked the pace for a half and lacked a closing rally. KENTUCKY PEERLESS raced mid-pack in contention, was put to an early drive and failed to
respond. HEARTTHROB HALO circled five wide on the turn to threaten briefly and flattened out. DOCTOR LEO was not a factor. ASPEN CLUB was not a
threat. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE
MOST ACCURATE TIME.

RULED BY SPIRIT took comamnd from the gate, opened a clear lead on a well rated pace, repelled challenger turning for home and held the late closer
safe at the wire. STEEL GUITAR tracked the leaders to the far turn, rallied two wide to gain ground on the bend, angled out five wide for the stretch drive
and closed well but was denied. ZOSIAS SHIP stalked the pace from the fence through the final turn, rallied up the inside to loom in upper stretch and
evened out in the drive. STARTINI raced midpack to the top of the lane and rallied mildly in the stretch. DAT'S A GOODE ONE slow early to be the trailer
and passed tiring rivals. TAKE IT TO COURT failed to menace. FRANCESNFRIENDS raced in contention for a half mile and faded. DEBBO prompted the
pace to the far turn, made a threatening bid on the bend and faded coming home. CRIMSON GLORY dropped back on the run down the backside, was not
persevered with, galloped home and walked off. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO

Footnotes
CUSTOM CANDY reserved off the leaders in the turn, waited behind wall of front-runners, angled seven wide at the top of the lane and rallied through the
stretch to be clear late. OH MY GAWD unhurried early to be near the back of the field, circled nine wide to rally in the lane and closed well to gain the place.
MALLY'S MONSOON rated off the pace early, mounted a bid on the turn in a steady grinding advance to be along for the show. ALL AMERICAN PAT raced
mid-pack through the turn and made a mild bid in the lane rom the inside. TROSKA broke a step slow, trailed to the top of the stretch, swung ten wide and
showed late interest. SHARE THE DOE tracked down the backside, made an early bid to take the lead on far turn and flattened out in the stretch.
APRIORITY GIRL pressed the pace to be prominent in upper stretch and weakened. EARLY DAWN prompted the pace to upper stretch and faded through
the lane. ADAYINSPAIN set a pressured pace for a half and gave way.

Footnotes
HIGHLY WICKED set a pressured pace for the first half mile, dueled trading the lead to mid-stretch and gamely re-rallied to edge away in deep stretch.
ROYA reserved off the pace for a half, rallied on the turn to contention, angled out four wide turning for home and kept coming through the lane to gain the
place. LADY JAE pressed the pace down the backside, battled on the lead through the turn exchanging the lead with the winner several time, kept battling
down the lane and was outkicked in deep stretch. ANOTHER HOT MESS tracked the leaders throughout, failed to close ground and kept-on willingly to be
the clear best of the rest. CINCY'S ANNA trailed most of the way and passed weaker rivals in the lane. CARRY ON was not a threat. CAVE CREEK
pressed the pace for a half and came up empty.

Footnotes
HOT GOLDEN GIRL pressed the pace to the turn, took command, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and drew off as much the best. SUGAR
CANE GAL reserved off the pace to the bend, made a steady advance on the turn and continued to close ground in the lane finishing willingly. HARD
CANDY KISSES stalked the leaders to midway on the turn, made a three wide rally to threaten turning for home and weakened late in the lane. GRACE'S
VISION raced midpack theough the turn, angled out to mount a five wide rally and could not catch the top three while being best of the rest. SUNSET
FLASH showed some late interest in the stretch. WAKE UP DOLORES chased without impact. ZIPPITY ZOODA RED was not a threat. D'BUSKER rushed
up the fence while fighting with the rider to duel on the lead to the three-eighths pole, was taken up on the turn and eased to the wire. SPRING RAIN
dropped back steadily on the turn and was not persevered with down the lane.
