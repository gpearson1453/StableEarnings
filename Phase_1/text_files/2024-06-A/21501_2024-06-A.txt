THUNDERS ROCKNROLL set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, drifted out into the stretch, met the bid of LOVERS GIRL, dueled
briefly with that rival and edged clear late to prevail for the win. LOVER GIRL was reserved early, angled to the inside into the turn, saved ground through
the turn, ranged up to make a bid on the winner, couldn't sustain the run and finished second best. SHE'S MY WARRIOR pressed the early pace, raced
three wide into the turn, weakened late and held for third. CUPIDS CRUSH was allowed to settle early, raced five wide and offered no late rally. BIRDIE BE
GONE tracked the early pace, raced four wide and was empty late. SUNSHINE FEVER was void of any early speed, saved ground into the turn and never
fired.

SIR STERLING set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, dueled with THE ALLIGATORHUNTER to deep stretch, shook clear of that rival
and held off the late rally of DOCTOR OSCAR and was best today. DOCTOR OSCAR was rushed to be in a settle position along the inside, angled out
through the turn, was gaining steadily and needed more ground. THEALLIGATORHUNTER pressed the early pace, raced three wide through the turn,
dueled with the winner to late stretch, weakened late and finished a game third. XAVEY DAVE was reserved early, raced along the inside, angled out to the
five path through the turn and offered a mild late rally. BAYOU BENNY was void of any early speed, raced four wide and never fired.

Footnotes
COWBOY CAUSE was unhurried early, saved ground into the home turn, angled to the three path, made a bid on DAVIDS FAITH, dueled briefly with that
rival, shook clear and drew off as an easy winner. DAVID'S FAITH was hard sent to set a clear early pace, raced along the inside into the home turn, met
the bid of the winner through the stretch, dueled with that rival and finished second best. PROOF OF PURCHASE was outrun early, raced along the inside
into the second turn, passed rivals and was along for third. CHASENTHEONE was allowed to settle early, raced five wide through the second turn and
flattened out. TARPS STORM was void of any early speed, raced six wide out of the second turn and offered no late rally. MAFIA was allowed to follow the
early pace, raced three wide though the second turn and tired. UKRAINE STRONG was reserved early, raced three wide into the second turn and was
empty.
