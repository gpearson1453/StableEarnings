quarter pole and improved position in the lane. SHINING SPIRIT raced off the pace on the outside through the early going, came around the bend in the
four path and improved position in the stretch. WINE AND ROSES was away from the gate slowly, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around
the bend and passed tiring horses in the lane. CHAMPLAIN'S DREAM tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the
three path and faded in the stretch. GATE SONG raced off the pace between horses through the opening stages, navigated the bend from the two path and
