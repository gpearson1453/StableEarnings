Footnotes
CIRCLE THE MOON pressured the pace through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, dueled for the nod mid-stretch and widened the final
sixteenth. RUN DIEM Z took an immediate lead while angling to the inside, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, was met entering the stretch,
gave up the nod mid-stretch and relented the final sixteenth. SETTLEMENT DATE gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail and dueled to clear third later
yards. DOC ELM chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened mid-stretch. AIR KENNEY chased, raced in the four path on the turn and
showed little in the lane. DE'S CASTLE was not a factor. GLASTONBURY was also not a factor.

Footnotes
LOGSTRADAMUS stalked the early pace from the three path, dueled to the lead two deep approaching the quarter pole, drew clear midway on the far turn
and was steadily handled to widen. GRUMPY'S BUDDY saved early ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and
dug in to take second late yards. CANDY FOR JUBA quickly took the lead and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, gave up
the lead toward the quarter, dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened mid-stretch. RED HOT TODDY settled in the three path the first turn, left the
turn outside and picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and finished evenly to pass rivals.
ORANGEBURG settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and weakened
mid-stretch. ON A WHIM saved ground close to the early pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded at the rail into the far turn. HARDLY
EVER BETTER stalked two deep on the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, faded off the rail on the far turn and was eased in the stretch.

SWIPE THAT CANDY tapered in and stalked from the three path the first turn, challenged approaching the three eighths pole, took the nod entering the
stretch and dug in determinedly to inch clear late yards. QUINN ELIA was bumped then exchanged contact with Cold Cash leaving the gate, raced off the
rail on the opening turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in range of the lead off the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and dug in to
take second the final strides. FULL OF CHARM rated the pace inside, dug in to the challenge of Swipe That Candy nearing the three eighths pole, gave up
the lead leaving the far turn but remained close to mid-stretch before flattening stride. OWE YOU ONE veered out and made contact with Classy Foe
leaving the gate then stalked inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. JUNE BELLE ducked out and made
contact with Quinn Elia leaving the gate, settled in the four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far
turn and showed little more. CLASSY FOE was bumped leaving the gate and saved ground. COLD CASH exchanged contact with Quinn Elia leaving the

SOUL CATCHER stalked the early pace from the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep approaching the head of the lane
and dug in determinedly to hold off PAPA LINGUINE, who rated the pace inside and came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the
edge at the rail on the far turn, was met toward the head of the lane and dueled gamely before conceding; grudgingly. MY BOY CLYDE veered out leaving
the gate, rounded the first turn about the five path and bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn, dueled to take third past the
eighth pole but flattened stride late. TREASURER settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail
then flattened in the lane. O'RIGSBY rounded the opening turn about the four path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the
far turn and showed little in the lane. GREATANDGOOD stalked inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and remained close at the
rail on the far turn, but weakened past the eighth pole and was eased late.

and came along to take third late yards. ROOMMATE MARTIN stalked the early pace two deep, moved to even terms into the backstretch, gave chase from

Footnotes
CHEROKEE CASTLE chased inside but lacked room at the rail through the turn, rallied between horses leaving the turn, took the lead mid-stretch and held
on well. SWEET SHUGS chased outside, dueled to even terms in the four path approaching the head of the lane but was outfinished in the duel through the
stretch. UPSWELL chased through the backstretch, raced in the six path on the turn, entered the stretch widest and finished well at the outside withers of
the runner-up. JUBA'S PUNCH gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path and finished well. RIVER REWARDS RVF gave chase inside, rounded the
turn near the rail, was blocked approaching the eighth pole but dug in leaving the turn and finished well. SHUTUPN'KISSME pressured the pace leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn then weakened inside the sixteenth pole. SPEEDY BUBBLES chased
through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, angled to the five path entering the stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. CASTLE TOY
accelerated to the lead past the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge at the rail on the turn, was met entering the stretch and
weakened toward the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
SEA OF TRANQUILITY exchanged contact with I'mlivingthedream leaving the gate then stalked from the five path the first turn, bid past the three eighths
pole, took the lead three wide midway on the far turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and widened later yards. UNCLE PRESS broke awkwardly and outward then
stalked from the three path the first turn, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, contested between horses two deep on
the far turn but ultimately, had to settle for second best. DENIZETTI raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn in the four path and ran evenly to late lane before flattening stride. BLAZE FOR DAZE rated the pace while tapering to the inside, came
under pressure when met a the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, gave up the lead at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened past the
eighth pole. COLONIAL ROAD raced off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three
path and flattened in the lane. CANO'S BABY broke a step slow, rounded the first turn about the five path and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
raced in the six and seven paths on the far turn and showed little in the lane. I'MLIVINGTHEDREAM exchanged contact with Sea Of Tranquility leaving the
gate, raced well back off the rail on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. SAN SEBASTIAN settled in the three path the first
turn and never factored. HERE'STHEBREADMAN rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on
the far turn.
