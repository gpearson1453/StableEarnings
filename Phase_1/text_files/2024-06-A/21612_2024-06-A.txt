to be four-wide nearing the quarter pole and went evenly. SENSIBLE LUTE vied for the lead from along the inside to the stretch and weakened. LIBBY'S
GAMBIT was reserved off the early pace, moved up five-wide nearing the quarter pole but lacked a response when asked. LOVELY JOSEPHINE dropped
back while saving ground and failed to menace.
