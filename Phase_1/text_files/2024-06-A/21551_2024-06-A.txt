Footnotes
FARMER FRED R F was rated back at the start, unhurried early, rallied around the far turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed steadily and wore down
his rivals to get up near the wire. REIGN OVER ME moved up to challenge for the lead three across on the backstretch, drew off for a clear lead on the turn
and was caught at the wire. ATTILA THE STAR moved up to vie between horses on the backstretch, was taken back from tight quarters entering the turn,
fell back, came again and earned show. SMOKEN HOUDINI was unhurried early and raced in the back, rallied around the second turn, angled in for the
drive, bid to get within range and hung late. PINEY BLUFF failed to threaten in an even effort. NACHO GRANDE got away well, set the pace to the
backstretch, vied to the second turn, tired and gave way.

AWESOME STORM was never far back, raced outside, rallied around the turn, bid seven wide, closed willingly and wore down his rivals to get up in the
final strides. HESA PROSPECTOR vied to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and was caught in the final strides. CANYON DEL ORO was slow early, bid
along the rail on the turn, finished well and was gaining late. POOF HE'S GONE vied inside to the turn and stopped. JAZZ TOWN threw his head at the
start, made a quick move into the turn to challenge three across and stopped. SHELL GAME showed good early speed, fell back to stalk the pace along the
inside, angled out leaving the turn and stopped. RIG RIDER stumbled at the start and lost his rider. The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning the start. No
change was made.

Footnotes
BAM AGAIN was away alertly, vied to the turn, drew off and won going away. CHANCE TO DREAM stalked the pace along the inside, got through along the
rail on the turn, bid willingly, was no match for the winner and finished second best. HOODWINKED KATE stalked the pace, challenged for the lead on the
turn, fell back and finished evenly. MARK THE DATE settled off the pace, lacked a stretch response and did not threaten. KENTUCKY GOLD moved up
inside to vie to the turn and stopped. EXTRA SPIRIT raced in the back and showed little. NOLA BELLE broke slowly, was never involved and showed little.
MI PRINCESA stumbled and lost her rider. The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning the start. No change was made. Head on shot not shown.
