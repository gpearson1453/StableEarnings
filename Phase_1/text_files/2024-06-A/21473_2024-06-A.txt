Footnotes
MOGALU chased the early pace from between rivals, then rated back and dropped to the inside on the turn, angled out four wide leaving the turn and
closed full of run to get up in time to prove best under a drive. BRIT'S CANDYMAN was well rated on the inside, advanced on the turn on the inside, tipped
out three wide leaving the turn and made a bid to get the lead by the sixteenth marker but was caught to just miss. EDWARD MADDEN dueled for the lead
on the inside and dug in gamely in the drive but faded late, held show award. ANY SUGAR HONEY dueled for the lead and made a two wide bid off the turn
but faded late. COLONEL MOORHEAD chased the pace on the outside and came six wide off the turn and had no kick. BEE BY THE SEA was settled two
to three wide, came four wide off the turn and had no significant rally. NAUTICAL NATURE broke in the air and trailed throughout.

FLEETING EMBER pressed the pace four wide and made a four wide bid on the turn, drew off in the stretch to prove much the best under hand urging.
LAUGHING FIT was bumped shortly after the start, tracked the pace on the outside and was four wide on the turn, then got the place awafd late while no
match to the winner. STYLE AND PROFILE pressed the pace three wide and in between rivals, then fought on gamely for the place award but was
out-kicked late. JUST START DANCIN set a pressured pace while in the two path, then was inside a duo on the turn vying for command but weakened in
the drive. HOP A LONG pressed the pace on the in side and weakened.
