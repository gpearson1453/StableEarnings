MR MORRIS chased from along the rail to track the leader into the backstretch while saving ground, pushed through at the rail to assume command in the
run to the final turn, saved ground while leading through the turn, and drew clear late as much the best. ON MY GOOD SIDE away well and stalked the
leader from the back of a compact field entering the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished one out from
the rail in the drive to get up for the place. NU SOUP FOR BABY hopped at the start, but recovered quickly and raced to the lead one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, was overtaken from along the rail approaching the final turn, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the
drive to garner a share. RICK'S DANCER broke sharply and stalked the early pace while racing three out from the rail entering the backside, rallied two
wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. MAX BOOSTER away alertly and tracked the pacesetter while racing
three wide into the backstretch, continued two out from the rail into the final turn, but was outfinished over the final furlong.

Footnotes
STAY FANTASTIC broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of ENGLISH BAY
TEDDY through the second turn and into the backside, opened a clear advantage approaching the final turn, and held STAR ENTRY safely at bay late to
prove best. STAR ENTRY away alertly and tracked the leaders into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained his position in the run
down the backstretch, launched his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed gamely to prove clearly
second best. PARKER POINT settled at the back of the pace while saving ground at the rail, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the
backside, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive to get up for a share. WICKED NIGHT away well and tracked
the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, held his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering
the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. ENGLISH BAY TEDDY rushed up to press the pacesetter two wide entering the
stretch the first time, continued to chase his pace rival into the backstretch, struggled to keep tabs on that rival nearing the final turn, and faded over the final
furlong.

AVE'S IN COMMAND away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and into
the final turn, disposed of his pace rival leaving the turn, and inched clear to prove best. QUAGMIRE broke sharply and tracked the dueling leaders in the
run down the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the
drive to prove second best. RACING RIVER settled at the back of the pack while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid three
wide entering the final turn, shifted five wide for the drive and closed willingly to get up for a share. STANFORD BAY dueled for the lead two wide from
between rivals entering the first turn, continued to force the issue in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with his
pace rival leaving the turn, and finished three wide in the drive. JERSEYS IMAGE settled at the back of the pack while racing three out from the rail entering
the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. BABY GRAND away well and pressed the
pace three wide entering the first turn, continued to chase the leaders three wide in the run down the backstretch, struggled to keep up approaching the final

EYES OF BEAUTY rushed to the lead and got to the rail in the run to the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside, opened a clear
advantage entering the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. DUKE GIRLS away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while
saving ground along the inside, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to prove easily second best.
FOREVER SUMMER took an awkward step in the opening strides before gaining a stalking trip from along the rail entering the backside, rallied smartly
from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. E Z TONIGHT away alertly and stalked the early pace while
racing two wide entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive in an even effort.
DIPLOMATIC broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, chased the pacesetter in the run down the
backside, began to lose touch with the pacesetter approaching the final turn, and faded over the final furlong. STILETTOS ONLY unhurried early while
dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

two wide in the lane to get up for a share. MINI MARKET broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured
pace from along the rail in the run to the final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. FLYING MISS unhurried
early while dropping back to trail, launched her bid from the back of the pack approaching the final turn, and improved her position late while finishing three
wide in the drive. B C CHRISTIE away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of MINI MARKET entering the first turn, continued to press that rival
in the run down the backside and into the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. I'M ALL SHOOK UP stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing
two out from the rail, struggled to maintain her position in the run down the backstretch, and was eased over the final furlong.

BOLD ARCH away alertly and vied for the lead from the inside of I'M CORFU entering the backstretch, assumed command approaching the final turn and
quickly opened up a clear advantage, and continued to widen late while being geared down late. FINDING WAYS broke sharply and tracked the leaders in
the run down the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the inside in
the drive to hold the place. PURSUE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched his bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed smartly one
out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. LUCKY FORCE settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch,
commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed with late interest four wide in the drive. SET TO SHINE stalked the early pacesetters while
racing three wide in the run down the backside, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response while finishing
from along the inside in the drive. ARISTOCRACY stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, began to drop back in the run to
the final turn, and had little to offer late. I'M CORFU away well and pressed the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, was unable to
keep tabs on his pace rival approaching the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.
