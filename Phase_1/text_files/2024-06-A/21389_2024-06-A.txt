LANGSTON ROAD saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. NAPOLETANO broke in the air to get away behind his field then
moved up to reach contention before going a quarter mile, continued to be two-wide and finished well for the place in a game try. ICE TOWER saved ground
chasing LANGSTON ROAD and finished well for third in a steady effort. A SKIP IN THE PARK dropped back early, swung out to be five-wide entering the
stretch and rallied late. AWESOME MOVE raced in the middle of the field while four-wide and went evenly. AUTOCRAT saved ground while being allowed
to settle, angled out nearing the eighth pole but was not a serious threat. AIN'T NO SISSY was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and was
not a factor. SECRET SAGA was forwardly placed while racing three-wide for three furlongs and tired.

POWERIZED saved ground setting the pace in hand and drew off to win as much the best. ELDER MACK stalked POWERIZED while racing two-wide, was
unable to threaten that one but was clearly second best. DEKUDYLAN saved ground while being allowed to settle, got through along the inside on the turn
and during the drive and rallied late. DYNAMIC SECRET was close-up early racing along the inside, angled out to be two-wide nearing the quarter pole but
lacked a rally. POLIS was reserved off the pace, came three-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. K R RULES was forwardly placed early while racing
three-wide and weakened. KNOCKOUT GUY was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and improved his position. SOLDATNA was allowed to
settle early, came six-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. SIR ARGENTO was five-wide on the turn racing in the middle of the field and
lacked a rally. MR. EXECUTIVE was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and tired. CALORESE was off a step slow then dropped back and was not a
factor. KNIGHTLINE showed brief early speed while racing four-wide and gave way.

REIGN OF FIRE saved ground setting the pressured pace, opened a clear lead nearing the eighth pole and maintained a safe advantage. CHARMANT E
saved ground while being allowed to settle, slipped through during the drive and finished strongly. STEIN'S GIRL hopped at the start then saved ground
while dropping back early, moved closed along the inside on the turn, angled out nearing the eighth pole to be five-wide and finished full of run. SHE'S
RESILIENT disputed the pace set by REIGN OF FIRE from along the outside to the stretch and weakened. FLYIN BY prompted the early pace while racing
three-wide and tired. NAN ELIZABETH was unhurried early, came six-wide into the stretch and improved her position. EYES FOR GOLD bobbled slightly at
the start then was reserved off the pace, came three-wide into the stretch and failed to menace. RAFANELLI was forwardly placed early while racing

Footnotes
NEIMAN saved ground stalking the pace, angled out three-wide nearing the three-sixteenths pole and up up in the final sixteenth to win going away.
GODSEND dueled with LLOYDS LOGIC from along the outside, shook that one off entering the stretch but was unable to resist the winner in a game effort.
YOU'RE THE CAUSE saved ground while being unhurried, came two-wide into the stretch, split rivals nearing the sixteenth pole and closed strongly.
LLOYDS LOGIC dueled for the lead to the stretch from along the inside and weakened. WELTON was prominently placed while racing three-wide but
lacked a rally. MUNCEY was reserved off the early pace, came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. JIN TONG was allowed to settle,
came four-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten. MISTER MAFIOSO was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide and tired.

Footnotes
SIMPLY GRACIOUS stalked HARBOR LASS while racing two-wide, moved up to take the lead from that one entering the stretch and drew off to win with
something left. HARBOR LASS saved ground setting the pace to the stretch, was no match for the winner but continued on well for the place. UNBRIDLED
VIOLET was prominently placed while racing four-wide and finished well for third in a steady effort. TIA SUZI was reserved off the early pace, came
five-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. GORMLEY GAL saved ground while being unhurried and failed to seriously threaten. WINANYWAYUCAN was
forwardly placed early while racing three-wide and tired. SPORTY NUGGET dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and trailed.
