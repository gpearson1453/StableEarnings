Footnotes
ANGEL ON FIRE raced off the early pace, hustled along two wide around the turn, came three wide into the lane, responded willingly under a drive, ran
down the leader in the final sixteenth and finished clear. CANDY'S A DANDY tracked the top pair up the backstretch, edged up close late on the turn,
launched a bid turning for home, roused forward two wide, cleared the lead a furlong out then got overtaken late. HIGHWOOD pressed the pace up the
backstretch, vied briefly then shook free and led the way going by the quarter pole, got collared by CANDY'S A DANDY in upper stretch, steadily weakened
but remained well clear for show. SNUGGLE BUNNY raced three wide off the early pace, came under a ride late on the turn, swung four paths wide into the
upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. LONG MAY SHE RUN was off slow at the start, hustled up closer into contention but remained off the early pace,
saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and never threatened. AZTEC EMPRESS set a pressured pace up the backstretch, vied briefly
into the turn, came up empty near the five-sixteenths pole and quickly retreated. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND
WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

Footnotes
JILL'S LEMON DROP set a pressured pace into the turn, vied for the lead at the quarter pole, shook free in upper stretch, had plenty left in reserve and
drew off willingly. WUMPMUG raced in contention just off the top pair, hustled along two to three wide around the turn, sustained bid through the lane and
cleared second best. GANGSTER AMERICANO pressed the pace through early stages, vied for the lead with JILL'S LEMON DROP at the quarter pole,
could not move on with the eventual winner in upper stretch, weakened but held a share. SONG OF PRAISE raced off the early pace, saved ground around
the turn, hustled along into the stretch and just missed show. C L LEGACY raced outside off the early pace, swung five wide into upper stretch showed
some interest in final stages but never threatened. NAUTICAL MISS raced in range tracking the top pair, saved ground around the turn then weakened in
the lane. PRAIRIE FIREBALL raced in contention in initial stages then weakened off the front runners, chased two to three wide around the turn then gave
way. RACE WAS HAND TIME DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

Footnotes
CAPTIVATED DRAMA sped to the lead at the start and set the pace along then inside up the backstretch, held firm around the turn, cut the corner and
roused for more turning for home, responded, widened advantage and kept to task. HASTINGS SUNRISE raced up close just off the early leader, remained
in close range two wide around the turn, could not move on with the eventual winner in upper stretch, ran on and just lasted for place. OCEAN OF STORMS
hustled along in pursuit of the top pair in the opening quarter, flattened out around the turn, found more in late stages, edged closer and captured show. BIG
SWEDE was ridden along racing just off the early leaders, urged three to four wide around the turn, ran on into the stretch but needed more for serious
impact. SAILOR CHOW raced in range up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, cut the corner entering the head of the lane, gained closer
contention then flattened out. ALLO ENRY stumbled badly and got bumped at the start, raced in the last flight and never recovered from the poor start.
KOSELIO lacked speed, raced two wide into upper stretch and never menaced. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND
WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

FLOOR IT vied between rivals on the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to battle for command around the final turn, shook free turning for home,
widened advantage under a drive and finished going away. DEVIL'S SHADOW vied inside for the lead around the first turn, continued to battle up the
backstretch, dropped back a couple spots with three furlongs left to run, lacked room and steadied along the rail late on the final turn, cut the corner entering
upper stretch, launched a rebid, drifted wider and finished second best. BIG TAP raced five wide around the first turn, lacked speed and raced in or near the
back, swung six wide into upper stretch and finished with response. KHOZANTHEDESTROYER hopped and veered inward at the start, rated just off
mid-pack through the backstretch, made a two wide move around the far turn, ran on into the lane then finished evenly. GOD'S GIFT TO US tracked the
embattled trio up the backstretch, loomed boldly three wide the quarter pole then flattened out in the lane. KICKIN' CHARLIE vied three deep in opening
stages, continued to battle for command around the final turn then tired in the drive. TIME FOR ANOTHER raced five wide into the first turn, raced off the
pace, came three wide into the lane and never menaced. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING
VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.

the lane, sustained a steady bid and cleared second best. HEZA WILD RIDE rated near midpack, hustled along three wide around the turn, sustained bid
through the lane and secured a share. U S NAVY CROSS raced in the back, swung five wide into the lane and passed tiring foes. GALACTIC EMPIRE
raced off the early pace, ranged up closer four wide late on the far turn then flattened in the lane. RIVERSPORT broke in and bumped with foe at the start,
pressed the early pace, briefly vied for the lead then came up empty mid-way around the final turn. NIGHT TERROR set a pressured pace, vied around the
final turn then retreated. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO

SPANISH DELIGHT set the pace under pressure in early stages, edged ahead to a clearer lead and held firm around the turn, came two wide into upper
stretch, widened advantage under a mild drive and finished ridden out. PLEASINGLY applied some pressure to the leader through early stages, hustled up
two late on the turn, ran on into the stretch run and held place. CALEBS LADY was forwardly placed, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole,
sustained bid into the lane and cleared the rest. HOUSE WRECKER raced off the top two flights entering the turn, was ridden two wide into upper stretch,
showed brief interest then flattened out. ZANARAZZI was off a step slow at the start, raced off the pace, came three wide into upper stretch and never
threatened. MORE THAN A DIVA raced near midpack saving ground, hustled along the rail around the turn then gave way. JAVISTHA raced off the pace,
came four to five wide into upper stretch and never menaced. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED

SOPHIE'S STAR was well placed racing just off the top pair up the backstretch, edged up three wide to engage rivals for the lead leaving the quarter pole,
hustled along the outside into the lane, responded gamely under right handed pressure, cleared command past upper stretch, tapped once right handed in
the final furlong then drew off while ridden out. RUN A FIRE dueled inside of STELLAR POINT up the backstretch, battled on around the turn, got collared
for the lead in upper stretch, fought back to the eighth pole then was no late match for the clear winner. DR. WOODS MIRACLE raced off the early pace,
hustled along five wide into upper stretch and captured a share. TIZ A STRATEGY raced off the top two flights going by the half mile marker, given cue
three wide around the turn, ran on three wide into the upper stretch and had no late punch. COMFORTS JAZEL was off awkwardly at the start, raced off the
pace, came three to four wide into upper stretch and never threatened. STELLAR POINT moved up after initial stages and dueled for the lead, battled on
through the turn then tired in the drive. TALL TALE raced off the pace, chased along the inside and failed to move into contention. SECRET CITY raced in
contention through the early going, flattened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR
