Footnotes
JAZZY EMPRESS broke alertly, ceded the early lead and tracked the moderate pace from the outside, advanced three wide into the turn and chased the
leading pair approaching the quarter marker, was set down into upper stretch and took command at the furlong pole, was kept to task into the final sixteenth
and held safely for the win at the finish. CHARLOTTES DELIGHT prominent away from the start, attended to the moderate early pace, was taken off of the
rail and chased two wide into the turn, loomed nearing the top of the stretch and vied for the lead at the three-sixteenths, chased JAZZY EMPRESS past
mid-stretch and was outfinished in the final sixteenth, while holding well in the late stages for second. SHADOWED THOUGHTS allowed to settle in the
early running, saved ground into the turn and trailed heading to the quarter pole, tipped two wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker,
closed willingly in the late stages and got up for third in the final strides. ICY MISCHIEF tracked the moderate early pace from the inside, was well placed
into the turn and saved ground nearing the quarter pole, angled out into upper stretch and was outkicked at the furlong marker, re-rallied into the final
sixteenth and just missed for third. LEEDSTHESKY allowed to settle in the early going, saved ground into the turn and improved position at the quarter
marker, swung widest into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, could not muster the needed late response and was outkicked in deep stretch.
DADDY'S HONEY was hustled leaving the start, assumed early command and set a pressured pace to the half-mile marker, shook free into the turn and
carved out moderate fractions nearing the quarter marker, came under pressure nearing the top of the lane, was overtaken into the stretch and was outrun
to the furlong pole, lacked a response into the final sixteenth and gave way. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to
arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
MACLEAN'S RHYME hustled leaving the start, was forwardly placed in the early running and stalked the quick pace from the inside heading to the half-mile,
was well placed into the turn and saved all of the ground nearing the quarter marker, made quick move into upper stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong
marker, took command past mid-stretch, was kept to task while on the left lead into the final sixteenth and held foes at bay in deep stretch to prevail. GOOD
FOCUS hopped at the start and was off slowly, allowed to settle in the early going, was guided outside of rivals into the turn and improved position four or
five wide nearing the quarter pole, raced widest into the stretch and continued his advance at the furlong marker, rallied into the final sixteenth, could not
reel in the winner in deep stretch and was up in time for second. ELCONDOR broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was engaged by WORKDAY and
contested a quick pace with that rival heading to the half-mile, set the pace from the two path into the turn and carved out quick fractions nearing the quarter
pole, shook free into upper stretch, was confronted by MACLEAN'S RHYME at the furlong pole, was overtaken past mid-stretch and could not keep pace
with the winner into the final sixteenth, was outfinished for second in deep stretch and held for third at the wire. WILD WAGER took back off of the solid
early pace, trailed into the turn and ran in the three path nearing the quarter marker, advanced at mid-stretch and found his best stride late. HE'S INIT TO
WINIT prominent away from the start, raced close up to the early pace then got caught a bit in tight and checked out of trouble approaching the half-mile
marker, was guided to the outside heading into the turn and chased four wide nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked at mid-stretch, mildly re-rallied into
the final sixteenth but needed more. WORKDAY showed good early speed away from the start, engaged with ELCONDOR and disputed quick early
fractions with that rival heading to the half-mile marker, pressed the solid pace from the three path into the turn, was outrun into the stretch and tired in the
final furlong. This race was originally hand timed and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
RIVERSIDE ROSE rated nicely leaving the start, allowed to settle and guided two wide into the turn, roused at the top of the stretch and gained ground at
the furlong marker, shifted three wide past mid-stretch and closed fast into the final sixteenth, took command in deep stretch and held in a drive to prevail in
a good debut. CHOKECHERY SHARI tracked the moderate early pace from the second flight, was guided two to three wide into the turn and raced not far
back nearing the quarter marker, swung four to five wide into the stretch and advanced at the furlong marker, rallied into the final sixteenth, could not catch
the winner in deep stretch and got up for second in the final strides. A CLEAR BEHEST off a bit slowly leaving the start, rushed up in the early going and
tracked the pace from the inside, got caught in tight and checked out of trouble leaving the half-mile marker, was guided two wide into the turn and chased
the leading pair nearing the quarter marker, ran in pursuit of NEPHELE into the stretch, vied between rivals into the final sixteenth, was outkicked by the
winner in deep stretch and just missed for second, while holding safely for third. NEPHELE away from the gate in good order, contested the early pace with
PLAY MISTY CAT while outside of that rival, took a narrow lead into the turn then shook free nearing the quarter marker, maintained a clear lead into the
stretch, came under pressure past mid-stretch and was all out into the final sixteenth, was overtaken in deep stretch and weakened in the late stages.
DUTTON STREET GIRL away a bit slowly from the gate, was allowed to settle in the early running, guided three wide into the turn, shifted widest at
mid-stretch and found her best stride late. CLASSY DOE lacked early speed, saved ground into the turn and showed good late interest. PLAY MISTY CAT
broke alertly, disputed the early pace with NEPHELE while inside of that rival, lost position along the turn and gave way in the stretch. SURF STAR
prominent away from the start, raced between rivals in the early going then was taken to the outside and chased three wide into the turn, was well placed
into the bend and ran in pursuit approaching the quarter marker, could not muster a response in the stretch drive and tired.

Footnotes
TIGER QUEEN hustled from the break and sprinted clear of the field before going a furlong, had PRETTY THIRSTY in pursuit with the rest well behind, was
still traveling well in hand approaching the quarter pole, had a host of challengers to the outside as they turned for home, was cued to go on at the
three-sixteenths pole, burst clear once again and won with something left in a stellar effort. TESSA (GB) broke a beat slow and did not show a lot of early
speed, gradually advanced into contention down the backstretch while racing four wide, was fanned four or five wide of a group all bidding for the lead at the
top of the stretch, rallied best into the second spot but could not catch the winner in a good effort. MO TOWN GAL fractious in the gate, broke well and
tracked a few lengths behind the pace setting TIGER QUEEN, bid three wide into the stretch under heavy pressure, raced mostly on the wrong lead through
the stretch and could not threaten the winner. CODE RIBBON broke outward and started awkwardly, then was very slow into stride spotting the field a big
head start, settled well behind the field to the turn, saved some ground on the bend then swung six wide into the stretch and was gaining late. PRETTY
THIRSTY broke well but was outsprinted to the lead by TIGER QUEEN, chased that one for a half mile, bid for the lead a the top of the stretch but was
rebuffed, kept on to mid-stretch then weakened. THE GREAT HAYNES was outrun in the early going and had to be ridden to keep up, saved ground
through the turn, made a mild rally into contention, had every chance approaching the furlong marker then steadied late, losing all chance.

Footnotes
NO CAP broke alertly, showed good speed away from the start and set a solid early pace, dictated terms into the turn and carved out quick fractions while in
hand nearing the quarter marker, drew off into the stretch and was ridden out in the final sixteenth to prevail as much the best. CLARINA was prominent
away from the start and pressed the solid early pace, ceded the lead to NO CAP and stalked the pace from the inside heading into the turn, chased from the
rail nearing the quarter marker, was no match for the winner in the stretch drive and ran on in the late stages to be best of the rest. PARTHENA chased the
solid early pace from the second flight, advanced at the half-mile marker and stalked the quick pace two wide into the turn, continued to gain ground
approaching the quarter marker, could not keep pace with NO CAP into the stretch, was no match for the top pair in the final sixteenth and held for third at
the finish. PALACE MISCHIEF was away awkwardly leaving the start, lacked early speed and trailed heading to the half-mile marker, improved position
three wide along the turn, lacked a response in the stretch drive and passed tired rivals in the final furlong. ARA lacked early speed, improved position two
wide along the turn, could not sustain that run into the stretch drive and did not factor. CANDY LITZ chased the solid early pace from the inside, saved
ground into the turn and lost position nearing the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch drive and gave way.

Footnotes
MELANIE'S TIGER was hard to load, broke last and trailed well behind the field to the the turn, circled the field, came four wide into the stretch, staged a
furious stretch rally under steady handling, chased SUPERNAL down the lane and was up in time. SUPERNAL bumped a couple of times with NAFTIS
about a half-furlong into the race, then tracked in third position three to four wide down the backstretch, moved to challenge for the lead passing the quarter
pole, took the lead in mid stretch, tried to fend off MELANIE'S TIGER in the final furlong, battled gamely but came up short in a good effort. NAFTIS raced a
little erratically early, bumped into SUPERNAL about a half-furlong out, then chased PARTY WITH PADDY to the turn, came under a drive and attempted a
bid two wide at the top of the stretch, but got boxed in then blocked with trying to get to the outside, dropped to last, then re-bid late to gain third. PARTY
WITH PADDY broke best and seized the early lead, set very fast fractions, fended off all challengers at the top of the stretch, took a short lead then
engaged in a brief battle with SUPERNAL to mid-stretch and gave way.

MOVIETIME allowed to settle away from the start, was guided three wide into the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate
pace heading to the half-mile marker, chased two to three wide into the far turn, was set down in upper stretch and loomed at the furlong pole, took
command past mid-stretch and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. ITS THIEVERY tracked the early pace from the outside, was guided three wide into the
first turn and was well placed into the backstretch run, stalked the moderate pace nearing the half-mile marker, was roused two wide into the far turn and
took command at the quarter pole, was confronted at mid-stretch by MOVIETIME, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and held
well for second in deep stretch. FANTASTIC DREAM stalked the early pace and went two wide into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile
marker, chased between rivals into the far turn and lost ground nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to the furlong pole, was outfinished by the top pair in
the final sixteenth and held well in the late stages to secure the show honors. COOPERKLIMT tracked the early pace from the second flight, was well placed
along the backstretch run and saved ground into the second turn, chased from the inside heading to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and
needed more in the final sixteenth. EFFECTIVE GIG was allowed to settle and saved ground into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run
while not far back, gained ground three wide into the far turn, angled widest into the stretch, could not muster a late rally and passed tired rivals in the final
sixteenth. MAGICISTHEMOONLITE off a step slowly leaving the start, was rank into the first turn and trailed into the backstretch run while still a bit hard to
place, was taken to the outside and tracked the moderate pace while widest nearing the half-mile, gained ground four wide nearing the quarter marker,
maintained a four wide path into the lane, could not sustain that run into the final furlong and flattened out in the late stages. MACHO CHROME was hustled
to establish the early lead, assumed command and controlled the pace heading into the first turn, dictated terms into the backstretch run and set a moderate
pace heading to the half-mile marker, came under pressure into the far turn, was overtaken at the quarter marker and chased into the stretch, could not
keep pace past the furlong marker and faded in the late going.
