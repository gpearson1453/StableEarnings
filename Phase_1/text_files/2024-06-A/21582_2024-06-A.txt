Footnotes
SERENDIP RULER broke well from along the inside, dueled up front closest to the inside, shook off the other speed when straightened for home, enough
left in the final strides to withstand the runner up while allowing that one the rail late. BANJO BEAR dueled up front outside the winner, fell back off that one
into the stretch, trying to come back late, missed second. TIM'S BUDDY fell back after the start to trail, failed to menace. KNIGHT DISRUPTOR chased the
dueling leaders for three furlongs, had little left for the stretch run. FIRE EXTINGUISHER last away, lacked speed, charged up the rail late to be rapidly
getting to the winner. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
POLLY TIZ broke with the leaders, dueled past the wire the first time, put a head in front midway on the first turn, shook clear into the far turn, bit rank,
maintained advantage through the lane under firm handling. HANGXIETY in the second flight after moving off the inside, bit closer three wide turning for
home, slowly getting to the winner late from the outside, clearly second best. PEARLY fell back to trail after the start, continued to lack speed, along for the
show late while not a threat to the top two. EXCETERA in the second flight while racing four wide, lacked a closing response in the drive, outkicked for the
show. LENA'S SHADOW broke with the winner, dueled with that one early inside, pressed that rival up the backstretch then gave way in the final turn to trail
home. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

STORM CATCHER took command after the start, showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, drew out through the lane under steady handling. IRA
CHAMP within striking distance out in the strip, chased the winner into the lane, proved no match for that one, held second. STOOPS SINE DIE pressured
the winner from along the inside for just over a quarter and began to weaken. C B'S FLAT OUT off step slow, lagged, four wide into the lane, lacked rally.

NIGHT VISION last away, trailed early, staged a middle move to reach a striking position with a quarter to run, made no other inroads with that one through
the lane, not enough for the place late while inside the runner up. PRECIOUS CARGO was finished early, far back. BROWN RESERVE pressed the winner
from the outside. HE'S ALL EARS back off the early pace just off the inside, checked up into the first turn, remained back in failing to rally. MEGA SHACK
broke alertly, cleared to the inside early, rated when showing the way early, continued to show the way up the backstretch, drew well clear through the lane
under a moderate hand ride to win ridden out. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the
most accurate time.

Footnotes
EXPLOSIVE PRIDE broke well, dueled up front off the inside, disposed of that rival when straightened for home, enough left to hold the runner up safe late
while inside that one at the wire. KISSOFTHENILE outrun early along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, eased out a bit for room upper
stretch, covered up approaching the sixteenth marker then finished willingly when clear to close the gap on the winner. HE BLUE BAYOU broke on top,
alternated up front for three furlongs inside the runner up when could not keep up, caught late for the place. SHAGGY EDGE last to leave, lacked early foot,
displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve position slightly. LANGMEAD forwardly placed early off the inside, had little left for the drive. MAJOR
PAYNE fell back to trail after breaking near the rear, was always outrun. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video
technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
SKY ECHO close from the start, challenged three wide midway up the backstretch, checked out far turn and coasted home comfortably in front under steady
handling. SCANDALOUS broke in, was straightened only to race in some traffic into the first turn, improved 2nd turn, no match winner, clearly second best.
SUGAR COATED bumped at the break, recovered to duel off the inside into the first turn, relinquished the advantage to the winner with a quarter to run,
proved no match for the runner up soon after, far clear of the other two. ROMINA C dueled up front along the inside, gave way after a half. INDY
SPRINKLES pinballed at the break, four wide into the first turn in avoiding some traffic, remained back in failing to rally. This race had a timing discrepancy
or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
PURE CONNECTION broke back, raced unhurried early, began to move after five furlongs, collared the leader late in the final turn, wore that rival down
through the stretch. CATALE WINEMIXER broke on top, dueled up front off the inside, rated up the backstretch the second time, clear into the far turn,
responded when confronted by the winner soon after, gave ground grudgingly to that rival through the lane while closest to the inside. MUCHO MIA off a
step slow, remained void of speed for five furlongs, staged a mild rally to annex the show and be clear of the others, no threat to the top pair. STONE COLD
LOVER away well, alternated up front inside the winner for five furlongs and began a steady retreat. LADY YELLOWSTONE closest to the dueling leaders
three wide, moved a bit closer into the second turn then began a gradual fade soon after. KIMBELL'S STRATEGY four wide in the first turn when off the
pace, continued well out in the strip and continued to race in the four path through turns two and three, roused into the lane, failed to respond. RUBY THE
DESTROYER closer four wide into the second turn, weakened soon after. FREYAS CATZ in mid pack for a half, gave way. This race had a timing
discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
MINGUS dueled early along the inside, vied closest to the inside, onto the backstretch, fell back from the runner up into the far turn, asked along, rebid from
the outside late, edging clear in the final strides. WESTCOAST BREEZE in a bit tight at the start, stalked the pace off the inside, early bid three wide
backstretch, shook clear in the final turn but could not contain the winner late. TRAFFIC BOSS within striking distance along the inside in hand, continued to
maintain contact with the leader by saving ground through the first turn, lacked a winning response when called on for the drive. LET ME LOVE YOU one
paced throughout, lacked a closing kick. CLEARLY A JET void of early foot, lacked a serious closing response. DOCS DUTY was never involved while
saving ground throughout. BORN TOUGH dueled up front early while off the inside, stopped late backstretch, continued to give way through the lane to trail
home. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
