Footnotes
BAYOU MAGIC broke out and bumped a rival at the start, vied two wide and between horses, led narrowly around the turn, drove clear in upper stretch and
lasted safely late. CAUSE A RUCKUS tracked the leaders from the two to three path, tipped four wide to take aim outside of the entering the lane, stayed on
to bid for place in the final furlong, then leaned in and brushed that position holder whlie edging past in the final sixteenth. ROYAL COURT vied three wide,
failed to keep pace with an inner counterpart in upper stretch, yet sustained a chase hanging on his left lead while holding place through midstretch, but was
brushed by an outer place-bidder in the final sixteenth and lost place late. LEFT POCKET MONEY vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals around the turn,
but gave way in upper stretch. AUDEN pressed outside of the leading trio leaving the chute, but chased down the backstretch and faded turning for home.
FALCON QUEST was reluctant to load, then took contact from an inner rival at the start, trailed in the two path and made little impact. GIMME LOVE hit the
outer stall door and was off slow, lacked speed along the inside and got outrun.

Footnotes
I'M WIDE AWAKE rushed forward after brushing with an outer rival at the start, dueled with an inner foe into and around the turn, cleared that one entering
the lane and drew off under a drive. LIKE A SALTSHAKER brushed with an inner foe at the start, tracked four wide, chased under urging around the t urn,
inched closer to gain place entering the lane and held that position from an inner bidder. ETERNALLY GRATEFUL leaned a bit outwardly at the start, raced
off of the pace along the inside, split foes two wide to advance in upper stretch, offered an inside bid for place in the final furlong but was kept at bay. PICO
D'ORO rated at the rear two wide, swung out five wide in upper stretch, surpassed tiring rivals but failed to menace. SPEITFUL SAM dueled for the lead
inside of the eventual winner, but weakened entering the lane. CAN MAN DO stalked outside of the top pair early on, chased them into and around the turn,
but faded between horses in upper stretch.

PRINTS MONEY vied for the lead inside of a rival, shook free of that one shifting to the two path entering the lane and held sway. MO HOPE brushed an
inner rival at the start, laid off of of the pace in the two path, shifted five wide entering upper stretch, rallied to gain place in the final furlong and was fended
off by the leader through the late stages. MALIBLUE stalked behind the top pair and from the two path, gained place from an outer rival in midstretch,
chased the leader home and got outkicked for place in the final sixteenth. ALILNALOT broke a bit outwardly at the start, tracked while forwardly place in the
four path, but got outkicked for minor placings entering midstretch, lacked a bid and held fourth. TIE BREAKER LENNIE raced off of the pace in the four
path, floated out to the six path in upper stretch and ran on mildly. BALTIMORE HEART bobbled a bit and exchanged bumps with an outer rival at the start,
pursued from midpack, but lacked progress through the lane. AIR FORCE CRUISING vied for the lead outside of a rival while remaining a path away from
that foe around the turn, failed to keep pace with that one entering upper stretch, lost place in midstretch and weakened. KEYPAD lacked speed along the
inside, shifted out in the final furlong and failed to factor. CLAY KICKER was brushed by an outer rival and forced to trade blows with an inner foe at the
start, lagged behind into the turn, cut the cap in the two to four path turning for home and made little impact.

Footnotes
HAPPYMAC showed the way a path off of the inside, drew off entering the lane and widened under a drive. HUNTERTOWN chased forwardly in the four
path and between horses, bid for place along with an outer rival at the furlong grounds, forged that position and held. LEADER OF MEN tracked in the five
path, bid for place along with an inner rival in midstretch but was turned away late. J W RUCKUS broke slowly, trailed in the three path, moved out to the six
path in the final furlong and offered a belated kick. VOODOO ZIP pressed the leader from the three path, proved no match for that one entering upper
stretch, yielded and was found to have bled. IMPROBABLE STORY chased forwardly along the inside, but yielded position to outer rivals into the turn and
tired.

Footnotes
DIVINELY BOLT tracked two to three wide, came under urging within striking range around the far turn, got brushed four wide by an inner rival entering the
lane, sustained gradual progress along with that one to bid in the final sixteenth and inched an advantage late. WINDY BAY stalked two wide, pressed down
the backstretch, bid turning for home, forged an advantage entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch, but was worn down in the closing stages.
THESTRAL bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn, brushed an outer foe shifting outside
of the top pair entering the lane, sustained slow progress along with his outer counterpart to offer a bid in the final sixteenth, but got outfinished and missed
place. ROCK STAR DOCTOR bumped with an inner rival at the start, lagged behind early on, cut the gap in the three path turning for home and surpassed
tired rivals. CLASSIC PERFORMER set the pace along the inside, got headed entering the lane and weakened. JE SUIS RAPIDE lacked speed along the
inside and failed to factor.

Footnotes
BANJO CHRIS broke a step slow, lacked speed in the four path, floated to the seven path into upper stretch, rallied along with an inner rival while shifting
inwardly in the final furlong, bumped his inner counterpart before completing a bid in the final sixteenth and prevailed at the wire. TROUBLE'S ROARING
pursued from midpack two wide and between horses early on, steadied when put to tight quarters in the three path at the three furlong pole, dropped back
and lost position in the aftermath, recovered swinging to the six path entering the lane, rallied along with an outer rival, got herded in by that one in the final
furlong, took contact from him while bidding in the closing stages and missed at the wire. ALCOVE pressed two wide, bid along with an outer rival at the five
sixteenths pole, led into the turn, drove clear at the furlong grounds, but was collared by a pair of outer bidders in the closings stages. CAFE RACER raced
off of the pace along the inside, steadied behind foes at the half mile pole, shifted out to the three to four path while picking up stride into the lane and rallied
between horses to edge fourth late. GLACIAL POWER showed the way along the inside into the turn, got headed while inside of a pair of bidders nearing
the lane, yielded in midstretch, shfited out and lost fourth late. HE'S ELUSIVE dislodged his rider briefly pre-race, pursued from midpack among foes early
on, then along the inside into the turn, moved two wide and between horses at the three furlong pole, entered the lane in the three path and chased evenly
shifting inwardly in the final furlong. D DAY leaned in and brushed the gate at the start, trailed in the three path, entered the lane in the six path and moved
up belatedly. LIEUTENANT GENERAL chased forwardly along the inside and weakened entering the lane. SANG raced forwardly in the three path,
checked between horses into the turn, chased in the three to five path turning for home, then weakened between horses. ROYAL CAROL raced off of the
pace in the three to five path into the turn, tucked to the three path turning for home, then failed to menace. NOT SO HOLY broke a step slow, advanced
outside of rivals to stalk the top pair form the four path into the turn, bid turning for home, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch and faltered between
horses at the furlong grounds. THE RIDER OF TROUBLE'S ROARING CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST BANJO CHRIS FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP
STRETCH, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

MIGHTY MADISON tracked behind rivals, checked while hard to handle leaving the nine sixteenths pole, pulled and advanced to bid three wide along with
an outer rival entering the turn, drove clear in upper stretch and held sway from an outer pursuer. SUNDANCE FEATURE prompted along the inside,
stalked approaching the turn, bumped an outer rival shifting to the three path at the three furlong pole, brushed his way to the five path entering the lane,
then ran on willingly, closed in on the clear leader late but needed more. POPPERINA broke a step slow, raced off of the pace along the inside, shifted two
wide into the turn, steadied hard when floated to the four path and put to tight quarters at the three furlong pole, recovered stride entering the lane, lugged in
before splitting foes two wide nearing midstretch and edged show. OUR KEEPSAKE pursued in the five path into the turn, got brushed to the six path
entering the lane, yet kept on to surpass tired rivals. STUNNINGLY brushed while forging between horses at the half mile pole, advanced to bid four wide
entering the turn, prompted turning for home but gave way between horses through the lane. PLUM TRICKY raced forwardly in the three path, bid
approaching the turn, vied with outer bidders turning for home, but gave way entering the lane and faded. DEVIL BLUE DRESS showed the way
approaching the turn, got headed while inside of a trio of rivals at the three furlong pole and weakened.

Footnotes
OTTO THE CONQUEROR pressed two wide, prompted around the turn, vied into the lane, gained an advantage at the furlong grounds, drove clear and
held from an outer bidder. HENRO was slow early on, trailed in the two path into the turn, swung out to the four to five path entering the lane, rallied to take
aim on the clear leader in the final sixteenth, but needed more to reel that one in. DONCHO set the pace along the inside, led narrowly as an outer rival
applied pressure around the turn, got headed by that one in midstretch and yielded. BEELINE tracked three wide, got outmoved by an outer rival while
drifting to the four path entering upper stretch and lacked a bid. NORMANDY HERO stalked along the inside, chased turning for home and faded.

Footnotes
BACKSTRETCH ROSE pursued from midpack in the two path, tracked behind the leaders while looming a danger around the far turn, was bumped and put
to crowded quarters attempting to split foes entering upper stretch, altered outside of rivals at the three sixteenths pole, regrouped to rebid in the final
furlong, led at the sixteenth pole and held from an outer challenger. STERLING LUCK lacked speed in the three to four path, rallied outside of rivals to take
aim on the new leader in the closing stages, but was fended off. LOOKING FOR GINNY trailed along the inside, entered the lane in the four to five path and
ran on belatedly to reach show at the wire. STRATOSPHERIC stalked three wide, pressed two wide into the far turn, gained an advantage nearing the lane,
dug in to resist an outer challenge in upper stretch, but was caught by a wider bidder entering the final sixteenth, yielded and lost show at the wire.
GOURMET bobbled behind leaving the gates, tracked four wide, pressed three deep around the far turn, bid in upper stretch, but was outkicked by outer
rivals in the final furlong and missed show between horses. MISS SUSAN B leaned in at the start, pursued from the two to three path and failed to menace.
CHARM OF THE SONG pressed two wide, forged an advantage with nine sixteenths to go, led along the inside into the far turn, but was headed nearing
the lane, bumped with an outer rival entering upper stretch and weakened. BARSTOOL BABE lacked speed along the inside, then two wide around the far
turn and made little impact. CANDY CRAZE showed the way along the inside early on, got headed by an outer presser at the nine sixteenths pole, chased
shortly after and faded around the far turn. OH MACARENA tracked along the inside, but was shuffled back behind a faltering foe around the far turn and
tired.
