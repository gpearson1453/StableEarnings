Footnotes
YO DAWG stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and kicked clear in the lane. FRANZ
trailed the field early, came around the turn in the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. BIRDIE MACHINE tracked the
leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path, brushed with CLEAR THE COAST near the quarter pole and flattened
out in the lane. CLEAR THE COAST led the way between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend, bumped lightly with BIRDIE MACHINE
entering the stretch and faded in the stretch. COASTAL FOG dueled on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three
path and tired in the lane.
