Footnotes
PRINCESS IS OLIVIA showed the way inside of a prompting rival, vied with that one around the turn, sparred through upper stretch, got narrowly headed at
the furlong grounds, yet fought on gamely to re-edge an advantage whlie taking light contact in the shadow of the wire. CORRI FELICE prompted outside of
the eventual winner, dueled around the turn and through upper stretch, wrestled a small advantage at the furlong grounds, but failed to kick on, hung late
and brushed her inner counterpart while getting outfinished. MORNING MIRACLE stalked along the inside, chased shifting out to the two to three path in
upper stretch, edged show and held from an outer bidder. PLAY MAKER tracked three wide, spun for home in the five path, then chased mildly and missed
show. BELIVE N THE DREAM raced off of the pace along the inside and failed to menace. NOTHING BUT TIME tracked two wide and between horses
while tugging in the bit down the backstretch, chased getting floated to the three to four path while between rivals in upper stretch and yielded. EMOTIONAL
broke inwardly after being off a step slow, trailed in the two path around the turn and got outrun. POSSESSION broke multiple lengths slow, was urged to
advance in the three path around the turn, but lacked a response and tired.

Footnotes
MISS JEOPARDY was bumped by an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside, shifted two wide into the turn, progressed cutting the
corner entering the lane, bid inside of the leader in upper stretch, forged an advantage at the furlong grounds, sparred through the late stages and held.
RUTHLESS RUA was off a bit awkwardly, rushed forwardly between horses to vie with an outer rival down the backstretch, led in the three path into the
turn, drew clear turning for home, but met an inner challenge in upper stretch, got headed at the furlong pole, fought on to sustain the battle late but was
denied. IDALOU leaned into an outer rival before shifting inwardly at the start, trailed in the four path, swung to the seven path entering the lane and ran on
to gain show late. GLORIETTE stalked in the five path, chased in the six path entering the lane, sustained stride to edge show in the final furlong but got
outkicked by an outer bidder late. NEUTRALIZE raced off of the pace in the three path, shfited to the five path in upper stretch and failed to menace
between horses. BOBBIE SOX vied with an inner rival while in the four path, chased that clearing foe around the turn and gave way. EMPIRES PRINCESS
lacked speed along the inside, shifted two wide nearing the lane and failed to factor. MISS SAIPAN chased from midpack in the five path and faded entering
the lane in the eight path. LUCY JANE chased close up along the inside but faded around the turn.

and held sway. MORINGA laid off of the pace in the two path, rallied through the lane to gain place and take aim inside of the leader at the sixteenth pole,
but needed more to reel that one in. MIYAKO broke a step slow, advanced to track in the four path, took aim pursuing the new leader in upper stretch, but
only managed to chase, lost place to an inner rival at the sixteenth pole and saved show from an outer bidder at the wire. SATIN BLUE broke a beat slow,
then was bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe and jostled early on, lacked speed two wide, advanced inside of rivals turning for home before fanning
to the six path into the lane, then sustained her progress to offer a late bid for show, but missed. CLOSING PRAYER jostled an inner rival early on, raced
well back three to two wide into the turn, then stayed on between horses. DREAMSCAPE was bumped by an inner rival at the start before taking firm
contact from an outer rival early on, steadied in uncomfortable quarters at the nine sixteenths pole, trailed in the two path into the turn, then advanced
willingly through the lane. JUS EVELYN chased from midpack in the three path, gave way around the turn before getting floated to the seven path entering
teh lane, and continued to fade. CAROLINA CANDY sped clear early on, showed the way in the two path, but was overhauled at the three sixteenths pole
and stopped. NOW HIRING laid off of the pace in the four path and faded. MAY MAY STRONG bumped an outer rival at the tart, lacked speed along the
inside and got outrun. SUCRE CECILE chased forwardly in the two path and weakened.

HAROLD'S CLOUD stalked behind the leaders and from the two path, chased them from the three path around the far turn, took aim outside of them from
the five path in upper stretch, sustained slow progress to offer a late bid and edged past in the shadow of the wire. GILDED CRAKEN took contact from an
outer rival at the start, led narrowly from an outer prompter, vied with that one around the far turn, inched a margin in upper stretch, battled gamely into the
final sixteenth, but was outkicked by a wider bidder late and dead-heated for place. DANCE SOME MO was reluctant to load, vied with an inner rival while
taking the first turn in the four to three path, sparred in the two path around the far turn, fought on to sustain the duel into the final sixteenth, but was
outkicked by an outer bidder late and dead-heated for place. PANDO pursued from midpack in the three path, chased in the two path around the far turn,
but lacked the needed punch to offer an inside bid. MY ROMEO LIMA lunged into an inner rival at the start, tracked in the four path, chased in the six path
into the final furlong and lacked a bid. WELAKA trailed early on despite constant urging and made little iampct. C F V BULLET checked from between
horses early on, saved ground well back to no avail. MENA laid off of the pace in the four to three path around the first turn, but was done entering the far
turn.

DAZZLEMESILVER laid off of the pace in the three path, swung out to the six path entering the lane, rallied to drive past the leader at the sixteenth pole and
drew clear. SOUND DOCTRINE dueled with an outer rival around the turn, shook free entering the lane, shifted out in upper stretch, but was caught by an
outer bidder at the sixteenth pole and held place. MIDNIGHT STORMY was bumped and bothered by an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide,
gained between horses entering the lane, sustained progress to take aim inside of place in the final furlong but was kept at bay. CANAVALL lacked speed
along the inside, then moved up. MACKVILLE dueled for the lead two wide, but gave way entering the lane and weakened. SAINT PETER'S BAY chased
along the inside and yielded. OVERBORE broke a step slow, lacked speed in the three path, shfited out to the six path into upper stretch and failed to factor.

embattled leading pair from the four path, chased in the five path and between horses entering the lane and weakened. TOWN BRANCH broke in and
bumped a rival at the start, chased from midpack in the five path and weakened.

Footnotes
DELAHAYE was bumped by an outer rival and forced to brush an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace three wide, shifted four wide turning for home,
rallied widest in upper stretch to bid at the furlong grounds and drove clear. HEAVENLY SUNDAY broke inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, pressed
outside of the leader, but got outkicked by an outer rival in midstretch, sustained the battle for place in the final furlong and edged that position. SAFEEN
showed the way along the inside, maintained an advantage before meeting an outer challenge in midstretch, but was bested by that bidder and lost place
late. BE MY SUNSHINE tracked two wide and between horses, chased among those foes in upper stretch and prevailed for fourth while not threatening.
MISREAD stalked three deep, got outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch and chased evenly therafter. FUENTE OVEJUNA (GB) saved ground whlie
tracking, but only managed to chase through the lane and lacked a bid. EXCELLENT QUESTION settled well back in the two path, shifted to the four path
entering the lane and failed to factor. IMMENSITUDE (FR) was brushed by an outer rival at the start, raced at the rear in the three path, then the four to five
path around the far turn and made little impact.

Footnotes
STAR OF WONDER traded blows with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three to four path, swung out to the seven path entering the lane,
rallied to bid outside of the leaders at the furlong grounds and drove clear. PADIDDLE tracked along the inside, then from the two path around the turn,
searched for racing room in the four path behind the leaders entering the lane, split foes in the three path in to bid in upper stretch, vied with outer rivals into
midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder leaving the furlong grounds, sparred for place through the late stages and prevailed. AIR IT OUT pursued
from midpack in the four path, shifted to the six path inching closer entering the lane, offered a bid in upper stretch, vied while hanging on his left lead, got
outkicked by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, dueled for place with an inner counterpart through the late stages but was bested. STRONSINO tracked
two wide, then in the three path around the turn, floated to the five path and among foes entering the lane before getting outkicked by bidders on either side,
then failed to threaten the top trio. BANNED FOR LIFE stalked in the four to three path into the turn, bid outside of the leader turning for home, led narrowly
shifting to the four path entering upper stretch, but was outkicked between horses shortly after and faded. TEMECULA exchanged bumps with an outer rival
at the start, chased forwardly in the three path, then along the inside into the turn, stalked before attempting a bid inside of the leader entering upper stretch,
but failed to sustain it and weakened. AWOL broke slowly, lacked speed in the two path and made little impact. LAKE SUPERIOR set a clear pace a bit off
of the inside, but faltered between horses in upper stretch. IDONEO pursued from the two to three path and weakened. GOLDENTOWN showed little.

Footnotes
DRAGOON GUARD dictated terms via a loose advantage, showed the way in the two path while well in hand around the turn, was set down in upper stretch
as an inner pursuer took aim, yet responded readily, drew off and was put to wraps with a sixteenth to go. LAT LONG tracked along the inside, took aim
inside of the leader entering upper stretch, but was no match and second best. INDY MAGIC raced off of the pace in the five path and stayed on to reach
show late. WILL TAKE IT tracked in the four path, inched closer nearing the lane, but yielded in upper stretch and lost show late. GAMBLERS TAIL trailed
two wide, improved but failed to factor. CASH ONLY lacked speed along the inside and got outrun. ALWAYSINTOMISCHIEF stalked the clear leader from
the three path, but weakened between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
STRIKINGLY SPUN laid off of the pace two wide, pursued along the inside around the far turn, sustained slow progress to bid inside of the leading pair
passing the furlong grounds and edged past. INFINITE DIAMOND showed the way in the two path, dueled with an outer rival turning for home in the three
path, but was bested by an inner bidder in the final furlong. SHE'S LOOKIN LUCKY brushed an outer rival at the start, pressed outside of the leader, dueled
entering the lane, but yielded with a sixteenth to go. SCHOOL DANCE trailed along the inside and failed to menace. TITUBA was brushed by an inner rival
at the start, racked along the inside but was done early.
