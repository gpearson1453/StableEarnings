CRY IF I WANT TO pressed the pace two then three wide into the far turn, made the lead nearing the quarter pole, her rider lost his crop at the three
sixteenths pole then drew off under a hand ride while drifting out to the middle of the racetrack to win as much the best. FLATTERING HEART with the
second flight around the clubhouse turn, split rivals near the nine sixteenths pole, dueled two wide into the stretch then was no match for the winner while
just holding on for second. STAKEMAKER stalked the pace along the inside for six furlongs, angled out to the four path at the top of the stretch then finished
determinedly and just missed getting up for second. QUICKSTYLE had speed for a half then faded. LA VILLAGE LUMIERE away alertly, set a pressured
pace along the inside for nearly a half, matched strides past the quarter pole then weakened in the final furlong.
