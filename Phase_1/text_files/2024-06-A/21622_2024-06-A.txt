Footnotes
PASS IT AROUND lagged early, saved ground, angled out at the top of the stretch and surged late to get up at the wire. SPORTS IDOL was hustled along,
set a pressured pace, inched clear in the upper stretch and was caught. CANDY TRACK raced close to the pace, challenged three across on the turn, went
willingly to the wire, didn't have enough late and settled for show. GOLD EXPRESS vied inside to late stretch, was unable to sustain his bid and lost position
in a good effort. JOHN JOHN veered out at the start, went widest in the drive and lacked the needed late response. BUDDY'S PAL raced in close, was
crowded and checked into the turn and fell back. WALKIN TALKIN BOB bumped at the start, pressed the pace, was checked into the turn and dropped
back. BRAVE TOEWS bumped at the start, lacked a response and was outrun.

NESARA was rated back at the start, taken outside, rallied four wide on the turn, was carried out and steadied entering the stretch, closed steadily and got
up late. JMARK set a pressured pace, swung wide leaving the turn and was outfinished in a good effort. STORM BY THE SEA stalked the pace while racing
inside, bid and came up empty late. SHUG'S ROCKET pressed the pace, was carried out and lost his path leaving the turn, fell back and gave way. EL
RAYADO showed speed to the turn and gave way. RAIL RUNNER raced in the back in an even effort and lacked a bid. This race had a timing discrepancy
or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

the turn, swung wide and lacked a rally. TRIPPLE SHAKE raced wide in an even effort and improved position. CASH FOLLOWS ME broke out, vied
between horses to the stretch and gave way. SAGA bumped at the start, raced outside, lacked a response and was not urged in the stretch.
