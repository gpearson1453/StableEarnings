stages, was ridden along entering the turn, responded mildly, came three wide into upper stretch and churned on to clear a share. RUSSIAN TO WIN raced
up close along the rail in the opening quarter, flattened out around the turn, saved ground then angled out and was no late threat. CASPER JUSTICE raced
between foes in o0pening stages, then chased three wide around the turn and lacked a needed rally. MISTER SHARPIE dueled inside of rivals up the
backstretch, weakened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive. THREE FOR THREE raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, shifted out
and failed to move on. LIBERTY'S HAULER showed brief response then steadily retreated.

KISSED A CADET settled through opening stages then edged up closer two wide around the turn, given cue three wide in the lane, responded willingly and
edged away. LIL SCREECHER got bumped at the start but managed to grab a slim lead strides out of the gate, dueled inside of BLITZED IN BEE SIX up
the backstretch, battled on around the turn, shook free to a slim advantage past upper stretch then got overtaken late. BLITZED IN BEE SIX broke in and
bumped with rival at the start, dueled outside of LIL SCREECHER up the backstretch and around the turn, could not match strides past upper stretch but
remained in striking distance then yielded late. ORPHAN SANDY lacked speed and raced in the back, swung five wide into the lane and improved. D D'S
LEGACY was forwardly placed and tugged up closer along the rail, lacked a clear path and steadied entering the turn, had to wait for an opening past the
quarter pole, cut the corner entering top stretch, got clear, given cue but had no response. FAYES SPIRIT tracked the early pace, raced in range three to
four wide around the turn then quickly retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
PARIS STYLE (FR) was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved ground around the first turn, remained confidently handled in the back past the half mile
marker, let out a notch leaving the backstretch, quickly advanced into striking distance late on the far turn, roused three wide into upper stretch, took over a
slim lead a furlong out then finished going away. ROSE PARADE was forwardly placed around the first turn, moved up and challenged
BLUELIGHTSPECIAL for the lead upon entering the backstretch, dueled outside of rival into the far turn, battled with TAKE ME SERIOUS past the quarter
pole, got overtaken by the eventual winner near the furlong marker, but fought back gamely along the rail to re-gain place. TAKE ME SERIOUS raced three
to four paths wide around the first turn, edged up closer entering the backstretch and raced in striking distance sitting just off the embattled top pair, moved
up to challenge for the lead near the quarter pole, vied for command into upper stretch, got overtaken by the eventual winner a furlong out and got edged
late for place. BLUELIGHTSPECIAL led the way around the first turn, then dueled for the lead inside of ROSE PARADE up the backstretch, battled on into
the far turn, flattened near the quarter pole then faded in the lane. LURE'EM IN rated along the inside while never too far back up the backstretch, had no
response when called upon around the far turn and faltered in the lane. KYNLIE'S EMPIRE raced in range four deep, came up empty late on the far turn
and steadily retreated.

OLGA ISABEL quickly cleared the lead soon after the start and crossed over to the inside, set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, continued clear in
hand around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch, roused for more, responded willingly, widened to commanding lead and kept to task under steady
encouragement. FAITH ALONE rated off the pace in opening quarter, picked up the tempo late on the turn, hustled along three to four paths wide into upper
stretch, sustained a steady bid and got up late for place. CONNIE K was the closest pursuer of the pacesetter up the backstretch, edged a bit closer two two
wide around the turn, was no match for pulling away winner in upper stretch but ran on and got edged late for place. LET'S BE CLEAR raced in the back,
saved ground around the turn, came two wide into upper stretch and never threatened. SHARP HERO tracked the top pair up the backstretch, hustled up
along the inside around the turn then retreated in the lane.

GO THE DISTANCE vied inside of ORE MINE for the lead from the onset, continued to match strides around the turn and into the lane, dug in gamely along
the rail, took a slight edge, fought on determinedly and held on. RUN FIRE RUN tracked the pace in early stages, picked up the tempo around the turn,
steadily edged up closer down the lane, raced in striking distance of the embattled duo, drifted in, bumped late with ORE MINE and captured place on the
wire. ORE MINE dueled outside of GO THE DISTANCE up the backstretch, continued to battle into stretch run, fought on gamely with inside rival holding a
slight edge, drifted out a couple paths, bumped with RUN FIRE RUN and got denied in final strides. BREAKABLE CODE raced off the early pace, swung
five wide into upper stretch, rallied strongly along the outside but ran out of time. RUNHAPPY D'ORO chased along the inside, saved ground into the lane,
was ridden along the inside in range then tipped two wide evened out late. RAHM raced off the pace, hustled up two wide late on the turn, ran on into the
lane and needed more for serious impact. ROMAN GIANT chased the top pair in the opening quarter, lost a few spots around the turn, was ridden four wide
into the lane and failed to threaten. GAMBLER ROCKET dropped to last after the opening quarter and steadily weakened. STEWARDS LODGED INQUIRY
