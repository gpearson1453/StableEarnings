Footnotes
CITY RAGE tracked the pace setter from the five path, bid from the two path around the second bend, went clear with ease nearing the quarter pole, kept
two task while clear through the wire. RADIEUX tracked the pace from the four path, still out side when put to the drive around the three eighths pole, closed
the gap to the furlong marker, was no match for the winner, second best today. STARDUST ZIGGY raced off the pace and along the inside, bid from inside
position around the far, racing on the left lead through the stretch, finished willingly. MIRACLE SILVER tracked the pace from along the inside, under urging
around the far turn, had no late response. SHACKLED LOVE set the pace around the first turn, easy tempo down the backside racing just off the inside,
came under pressure around the three eighths pole, and faded through the stretch. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA slow into stride, under coaxing far turn, never
threatened.
