MOONLIGHTNWINE saved ground while racing close-up early, steadied nearing the quarter pole lacking racing room, angled out to be four-wide nearing
the stretch and was up in the final sixteenth to win going away. HOT MEMORIES saved ground setting the pace under pressure from NYQUILER,
responded when asked and while unable to resist the winner held on gamely for the place. NYQUILER disputed the pace from along the outside of HOT
MEMORIES into deep stretch and finished well for third in a steady effort. EMPEROROFTHENORTH broke in the air to get away behind the field, then was
allowed to settle, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then faltered during the drive. WARRENS CANDY MAN was allowed to
settle while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. HADLEES HONOR was prominent early while racing three-wide on the
turn, came five-wide into the stretch and tired.

SHELBY GOLD was reserved off the early pace, moved up three-wide on the turn, gained a slight lead nearing the quarter pole then dueled with POP
CHART from that point and prevailed narrowly. POP CHART prompted DAREDEVIL PRINCESS from along the inside, responded when challenged by
SHELBY GOLD and just missed in a stiff drive. PARCO settled off the early pace while two-wide, angled out to be five-wide entering the stretch and finished
in a mild rally. LA POPIS settled in the middle of the field, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then flattened out during the drive.
FOGGY BOTTOM saved ground while being unhurried and went evenly. REALREALGOOD dropped back early, came three-wide into the stretch and failed
to seriously threaten. WEGOTTODRINKING was allowed to settle early, came six-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. DAREDEVIL PRINCESS set
the pace for nearly a half mile racing slightly off the rail and tired.

Footnotes
FEATHER INTHE WIND went to the front at once, saved ground setting the pace and was ridden out to increase his advantage. HEART ON THE RUN was
close-up while racing two-wide, could not threaten the winner but finished well for second. ALEX'S GIRL was brushed at the start by BIG MAMA
THORNTON then saved ground chasing the pace, angled out to be five-wide nearing the eighth pole and finished in a mild rally. FIRE ESCAPE prompted
the early pace while two-wide and weakened. BIG MAMA THORNTON broke in to brush with ALEX'S GIRL then was allowed to settle, came four-wide into
the stretch but lacked a rally. TIZ A TIGER was unhurried early, came six-wide into the stretch but was unable to seriously threaten. FRISCO FRILLS was
reserved off the early pace, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to menace.
