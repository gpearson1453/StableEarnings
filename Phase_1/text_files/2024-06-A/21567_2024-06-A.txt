PRIVATE LAKE was unhurried early, a factor on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. PRIVATE NETWORK set the pace
and had a clear lead on the far turn but was headed in mid stretch and was second best. REDOUTE'S LIGHT was well back and closed the gap from the
inside on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was all out. FIFTH SEASON stalked the early leader but chased on the far turn and had
no late kick. CRYPTIC CREED was in touch and roused on the far turn but had no response. A I INITIATIVE was off the pace, showed little and was never a
threat.

the early leaders, raced evenly on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch just missed. STORMY SOUL was hustled early and had a slim
lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. BRADY O'BRADY was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but from
the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. BIG BROWN BREWSKII had no speed and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat. GREAT GO

Footnotes
JIMMY IS A BREEZE tracked the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was much the best. ALMONTE
PRINCESS set a pressured pace, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held place. ASHWICKEN was in touch and raced
evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. FRAULEIN VICTORIA was unhurried early and moved up on the turn but was
no real threat. ASHCAR NELLIE was well back, saved ground on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. ALWAY'S ROSIE was in range and had
a good position on the turn but leveled off. BAMBOO'S BABE forced the early pace and dueled on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch
weakened. LEA'S SUNSHINE had no speed, chased on the turn and failed to fire. SIGNATURE RING was off the pace, showed little and from the six path
at the top of the stretch was outrun.

HADDASSAH'S DEVIL was in mid pack, had a good position on the turn and was kept to task through the stretch. POLITICAL was unhurried early, saved
ground on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for place. BEYOND MY DREAMS was up close and forced the pace on the turn
but had nothing left. HALF LIT set the pace and had a slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. LOQUACIOUS was
off the pace and moved up on the turn but was no threat. DIAMONDBACK tracked the leaders from the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the six
path at the top of the stretch was empty. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON DIAMONDBACK AGAINST HADDASSAH'S DEVIL FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON LOQUACIOUS AGAINST POLITICAL
FOR INTERERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH RESULTED IN POLITIACAL BEING DISQUALIFED AND PLACE SIXTH.

MOONBRIGHT was in touch, a factor from the inside on the turn and from the three path through the stretch proved best. TAMANA showed speed from the
inside and had the lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was second best. NICOLE'S SONG was unhurried early and saved
ground on the turn but finished evenly. SPEEDY JOHNY was off the pace, hustled along on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up
for a share. STRIKE THE POSE stalked the early leader and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch faded. GETTING
AHEAD was in range and roused on the turn but had no response. STOLE THE RING had no speed and showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
STREET SERENADE was in touch, raced evenly on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch drew clear. AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY was away
alertly and had the lead on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. BEST AND FINAL was off a step slow from
the gate and moved up on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. YOU SEE ME was off slow and trailed the field on the turn
but closed willingly through the stretch. SCREEN LEGEND was hustled early and dueled on the turn but had nothing left. VICTORY BALLAD was off slow
and roused on the turn but had no response. DELIRIO was up close and a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was empty.
