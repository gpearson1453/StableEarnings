DAPPER DON broke sharply and raced to the lead from off the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace through the second turn and in the
run down the backside, opened a clear advantage approaching the final turn, and continued to widen that margin over the final furlong, while being ridden
out late. CHABI away well and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, held a stalking trip in the run down the
backside, launched her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive to get up for the place in the final
strides. BORROWED EQUITY settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, advanced into a stalking trip
upon entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while unable to hold the place. BE SPARKY away alertly and
was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing three wide into the stretch the first time, dropped back to trail entering the backside, and failed to mount
a late bid while not being persevered with in the late stages.

Footnotes
MATSQUI settled at the back of the pack while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, launched her bid two wide from between rivals
entering the final turn, made the lead in mid stretch and inched clear late. HIGHER IMAGE settled off the pacesetter while racing mid pack entering the
stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, continued to save ground while commencing her bid entering the final turn, and closed willingly from
along the rail in the drive to prove easily second best. MARYS TAPPIN SHOES broke sharply and stalked the pacesetter into the stretch the first time while
racing just out from the rail, pressed the leader two wide in the run to the final turn, held a narrow advantage leaving the final turn, but had little response
when tackled by MATSQUI entering the lane, and was outfinished late. EBONY EYES settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail through
the stretch the first time, continued three wide in the run down the backstretch while racing into a tracking trip nearing the final turn, but failed to mount a late
bid when called upon. LICORICE away alertly and raced to an uncontested lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, maintained her
advantage into the backstretch, was collared by MARYS TAPPIN SHOES approaching the final turn, and weakened in the late stages.

TOBESUNNY broke sharply and stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside
entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in deep stretch to get up in time. ZETAMARIE away alertly, but was taken in hand and allowed to
lag well off the contested early pace, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed steadily four wide in the drive to just miss. RICHARDS
COMMAND away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and into the final
turn, got the better of her pace rival entering the lane, and gave way grudgingly late in a solid effort. CARLA'S HONOR settled off the early pace while
saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly while splitting rivals in deep stretch.
ANOTHERSUNNYDAY rushed up to duel for the lead from the outside of RICHARDS COMMAND entering the first turn, continued to force the issue two
wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with her pace rival entering the lane, and was outfinished late.

BLUEBIRD CAFE away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backside and through the final turn, and edged out her pace rival in the final strides to prevail. B C CHU CHU away alertly and dueled for the lead from
between rivals entering the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of BLUEBIRD CAFE in the run down the backside and through the final turn, took the
narrowest of leads into the stretch, and closed willingly to wide in the drive to just miss. SHE'S KIND OF HOT broke sharply and pressed the pace three
wide entering the first turn, continued to force the issue in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on her pace
rivals entering the lane, and finished two wide in the drive to hold on for a share. DAZ LIN FORCE was off a step slow while breaking outwards, stalked the
leaders from the back of a compact pack field in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing at
the rail in the drive. RALLY UP BECKA stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, lacked
room at the rail midway through the turn, and had little to offer late.

Footnotes
OSTRACIZE settled well off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, begin to gain ground through the second turn,
rushed up three wide midway down the backstretch and swept to the lead entering the final turn, quickly opened a clear advantage through the turn, and
was never seriously threatened late. ICE BREAKER broke sharply and stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first
time, advanced two wide midway down the backside, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to get up
for the place. AMANDA unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched her bid three wide from the back of the field entering the final turn, and finished
four wide in the drive to get up for a share. PINEAPPLE TIDBITS settled off the early pace while racing two entering the lane the first time, held her position
in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest five wide in the drive. TEXAS HUMOR tracked the
pacesetter through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue from the outside of STAR FINALITY in the run down the
backside, was quickly overtaken entering the final turn, and faded in the late stages. BAKZONE away well and tracked the leader through the stretch the
first time while saving ground at the rail, continued to save ground throughout, but weakened over the final furlong. STAR FINALITY away alertly and raced
to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of TEXAS HUMOR in the run down the backstretch,
was unable to keep tabs on that rival in the run to the final turn, and was eased over the final furlong.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF ATTITUDE settled at the back of the pack while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, bided her time at the rear of the field
in the run down the backstretch, launched her bid two wide from between rivals through the final turn, tipped three wide for the drive, and closed steadily to
be up in time. MISS THE HYPE away alertly and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time,
advanced from along the inside midway down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished steadily from along the rail in the drive to get
up for the place. ARTISTIC JEWLER away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first
time, rushed up four wide midway down the backside to loom a danger approaching the final turn, continued four wide through the final turn, and finished
two wide in the drive to garner a share. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER broke sharply and stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the
lane the first time, maintained her position in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the
drive. SILK STILETTOS rushed up three wide entering the first turn to assume a clear advantage and get to the rail midway through the turn, raced on an
uncontested lead through the stretch the first time and into the backstretch, was overtaken soon after entering the final turn, and faded in the late stages.
CERTIFIABLE stalked the leaders while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, struggled to maintain her position in the run down the
backstretch and had little to offer late.
