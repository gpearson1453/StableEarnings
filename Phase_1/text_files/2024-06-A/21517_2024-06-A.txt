SERENADE SOLDIER took over on the chute and rated the pace while tapering to the inside, pulled herself away from the five sixteenths pole, was hand
urged to widen on the turn then steadily handled in the lane. PLAYING FOR TWO chased, raced off the rail on the turn then dueled through the stretch for
second. LET'S DO THIS gave chase, raced three wide on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. MARTHA'S HEART chased through
the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and passed rivals outside. WINDSOR'S MEMORY chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn and
weakened in the lane. EVERYDAYISAGIFT chased inside, steadied at the rail leaving the five sixteenths pole, eased out approaching the head of the lane
but showed little more.

Footnotes
DIRECT THE SHOW pressured the pace and dueled for the lead in the three path approaching the quarter pole, contested the edge off the rail on the turn
and dug in determinedly for the nod. CHRISTOPHER'SHEART pressured the pace inside, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn,
dug in gamely leaving the turn but missed the nod under the wire. SPYDYLEGS angled to mid track to give chase, rounded the turn about the six path and
finished well. SHINEY GHOST gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened. DOG TOWN ALLEN chased, raced in the five path on the
turn and flattened in the lane. ROAD PUNCH took the lead leaving the chute and set a pressured pace, was met approaching the quarter pole and faded
through the turn. HE'S CLEVER saved ground. A late rider change on He's Clever delayed the start of this race by several minutes.

Footnotes
BIG ROWDY DAN was bumped leaving the gate, raced in the four path on the first turn then bid toward the three eighths pole, improved in the three path on
the far turn, dueled clear past the eighth pole and extended his lead with steady handling. FIELDSTONE rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward
the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, gave up the lead entering the stretch and had to settle for second best. BIG SMILE stalked off the
rail, dug in to challenge the runner-up nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened leaving the turn. DUST DEVIL raced in
the five path the opening turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and passed some rivals in the
lane. MINISTRY OF MAGIC raced well back off the rail the first turn, gave chase past the half mile pole and improved in the three path on the far turn,
angled out entering the stretch but flattened stride, pulled up lame past the sixteenth pole and was vanned off post race. GREAT DAYS AHEAD was forced
out leaving the gate, raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase past the half mile pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. TEMPESTIVO broke
outward and made contact with Big Rowdy Dan and was not a factor. SILIPO ducked out leaving the gate then rated close inside, gave chase from the
seven sixteenths pole but faded past the three eighths.

RUN TO DAYLIGHT came away sharply then dropped a bit off the early pace, closed to the lead toward the three eighths pole and rated the pace, came
under pressure past the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge off the rail on the turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. GRAND FIBER gave
chase, raced in the four path on the turn, dug in leaving the turn and got up for second the final strides. GRAND ESCAPE had a brief early lead then gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced close at the rail on the turn, dug in leaving the turn but was nipped from second the final strides. MOONSET
chased and raced close in the three path on the turn, but flattened stride nearing mid-stretch. PRIZE FIGHTER gave chase, entered the turn near the rail,
eased outward approaching the head of the lane and finished well. BUFFALO SHUFFLE gave chase, rounded the turn at the rail and flattened in the lane.
REY O REYES gave close early chase but faded leaving the five sixteenths pole. COWBOY AT HEART became a bit edgy just as the gate opened and was
subsequently detained when he reared and as the rider stepped off.

steady handling through the upper stretch and was taken in hand later yards. PRINCESS OF GOLD rounded the first turn about the four path, started a bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path the far turn and dueled to clear second mid-stretch. QUEEN SABINE raced in the three path the
first turn, picked up the chase past the half mile pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, was carried out entering the stretch but came along for
third late yards. CEDAR'S IMAGE tapered in through the front stretch and stalked from the three path the first turn, took the lead approaching the seven
sixteenths pole and came under pressure leaving the three eighths, was caught while between horses midway on the far turn and flattened in the lane.
SISTER WINNIE rounded the first turn in the three path, left the turn outside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, entered the far turn in the three
path, was eased out entering the stretch and flattened stride. SWEET WINDSOR rated a slim lead inside on the first turn, was met toward the seven
sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, recovered even terms at the five sixteenths pole but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and
weakened. SHOTGUN MARGARET raced in the four path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. COUNT THE FLOWERS
steadied lightly soon after the start then saved ground on the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn.
