JUDGEMENT TIME trailed early, advanced inside, rallied into the stretch and outdueled rival to the wire. KEEP IT SEXY well placed behind quick fractions,
bid outside in the lane, battled winner but lost head bob. PAYOUT RATIO (IRE) sprinted away to long advantage then weakened late. ABUNDANT LIFE
went after the pacesetter before half mile and faltered. CASH ON FIRST raced off the pace and failed to respond. STEAL THE DEAL lacked speed and
raced far behind throughout. WINE GODDESS dropped back wide under rating hold and was no factor. FANCY SCEPTER raced in closest pursuit of the
pacesetter briefly then stopped.

LUCKY OPPORTUNITY quickly took control inside then widened under moderate pressure while ridden out. ORB'S PARTY GIRL settled off the pace then
closed well inside through the final furlong. THE LAST JET lacked speed then advanced well wide through the stretch. UDIDN'TPAY prompted pace along
the inside and flattened out. I'M A LUCKY GIRL forced pace between rivals then weakened. GONE dropped far behind then passed rivals without
menacing. LADY GABRIELLE chased in midpack and was never a factor. LA BELLA BOROBETA saved ground within range early then retreated. GOOD
MAGICCHILD trailed long way and was always outrun. VICTORIOUSVICTORIA flashed speed three wide then stopped abruptly.

CATTI LA BELLE settled inside, bid to the front near the top of the stretch and drew away driving. ANNA ROCKS stalked the pacesetter, took over midway
on the final turn, was collared by the winner and proved no match. LIKE A PRO lagged far behind then rallied outside for the show. SHE'S GOT GAME set a
clear pace for five furlongs and weakened. MY BOSS LADY raced off the pace inside and was never a factor. OUI MADAME saved ground close up briefly
then gave way. CARLY HUSTLE lacked speed and weakened steadily.

SPEEDY BOLT raced in closest pursuit of the dueling leaders then wore down the dueling duo late following a long drive. FIVE DREAMS led narrowly
inside, lost the advantage briefly and dueled throughout in a very game showing. DIDINGER dueled outside, led narrowly at the eighth pole and continued
willingly to the finish. MEET ME AT MUNDIS chased off the leaders wide then flattened out in the stretch. CAPITAL CONQUEST dropped back at the start
and was never involved.

Footnotes
WE READY advanced three wide on the turn then held rival safe through the final furlong. THE ANGRY MAN prompted the pace outside, was collared into
the stretch and battled gamely to the wire. HENRYTHETHIRD dropped back early then advanced well to gain the show. TEEWINOT PASS forced pace
between rivals then inside and weakened in the stretch. COBBLE ROAD moved up inside and continued well while no threat. COLONEL JUAN raced wide
off the leaders and weakened steadily. INDOCTRINATE lacked speed and was never in contention. HURRICANE HIGHWAY trailed far behind then caught
fading rivals. EMPIRE'S SCORE dueled outside, led briefly on the turn then gave way. SMARTHUMOR flashed speed along the rail to the turn and stopped
abruptly.
