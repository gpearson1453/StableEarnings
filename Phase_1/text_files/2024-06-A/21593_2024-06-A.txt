Footnotes
GOLDEN BUCK vied for the lead with an outer pair of rivals while remaining a path off of the inside around the turn, gamely held an advantage from those
foes through midstretch before an inner rival menaced in the final sixteenth and clung between horses late. SUNDAY SPIRIT pursued just behind the
leaders before getting rank and pulling hard passing the five furlong pole, remained unsettled until the nine sixteenths pole, chased the embattled leading
trio from the three to two path around the turn, tipped inwardly in upper stretch, offered gradual rail progress to bid inside of the leader with a sixteenth to go,
but was denied late. TWIRLING TROILLET vied for the lead with an inner rival while in the three path, then between horses into the turn as an outer foe
offered a bid, sparred turning for home, brushed with his outer counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, then sustained the battle into deep stretch but was
kept at bay. BROTHER RICE was off awkwardly and brushed an outer rival at the start, steadied to alter course outwardly leaving the chute, gained in the
six path down the backstretch to bid outside of the top pair while tucking to the four path entering the turn, vied around the bend, brushed with an inner rival
at the three sixteenths pole, kept on through midstretch but yielded with a sixteenth to go. BAJAN BOY took light contact from an inner rival at the start, laid
off of the pace along the inside, altered course around a shifting rival at the three sixteenths pole, shifted five wide into midstretch and offered a mild kick.
HEZMORETHANREADY chased in the five path but faded into the turn.

Footnotes
STIR CRAZY broke half a beat slow and bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked from midpack tucking to the inside around the first turn, pursued
coming under light urging as an outer rival moved alongside turning for home, checked while encountering traffic attempting to shift out entering the lane,
tipped to the five path in upper stretch, offered a good kick outside of the leaders to sweep past leaving the sixteenth pole and drew clear. JOIN THE
DANCE bumped with an inner rival at the start, showed the way along the inside while well in hand around both turns, met an outer challenge entering the
lane, maintained a margin through midstretch, but was swiftly surpassed by an outer rival with a sixteenth to go and gamely clung to place. VALENTINA
DAY stalked two to three wide around the first turn, bid outside of the leader entering the lane, but failed to achieve even terms before chasing through
upper stretch, got outkicked by an outer rival in the final furlong, fought on between horses while battling for place through the late stages but was denied
that position. CAROLINE STREET settled off of the pacce along the inside, gained in the three path around teh far turn, shifted to the four path entering the
lane to take aim on the leaders in upper stretch, sustained slow progress to bid in the final furlong, but was outkicked by an outer challenger at the sixteenth
pole, vied for place in the aftermath, but hung and yielded late. SAMAY (PER) stalked forwardly along the inside, but tugged and shifted outside of the
leader around the first turn, pressed entering the backstretch, but failed to sustain pressure and chased along the inside turning for home, then gave way.
ROYAL TAKE CHARGE trailed two wide early on and was outrun around the far turn.

Footnotes
SPIRALIZER got fractious in the gate necessitating being backed out and reloaded, was sent forward after a bit of a flat-footed beginning, set the pace in
the two path into the turn, inched clear turning for home and held well through the lane. ASLEEP AT EIGHT tracked along the inside, bid for place
approaching the lane, edged that position in upper stretch, then chased his clear stablemate home and held place. MO HAIR SAM bumped the outer stall
door whlie last away from the starting gate, pursued while off of the pace in the five path, then ran on to reach show in the closing stages. CHARLIE TOLU
tracked in the four path, stayed on between horses in the final furlong and missed show at the wire. HEDGE shifted in at the start, prompted two wide early
on, failed to sustain pressure chasing in the three path turning for home, lost place to an inner rival entering upper stretch and yielded between horses.
MORLOCK broke a step slow, pursued from off of the pace in the three path, trailed in the two path around the turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
COX CANYON was bumped by an inner rival and dropped back at the start, lagged behind through the chute, rejoined the rest inching closer in the three to
four path around the turn, swung out to the eight path in upper stretch, rallied widest to offer a bid in the final sixteenth and forged an advantage in the
closing stages. TARTUFO broke out and bumped a rival at the start, pursued off of the pace in the four to five path, drifted out to the seven path while taking
aim on the leaders in upper stretch, sustained slow progress to bid along with an outer rival in the final sixteenth but got outfinished late. COOL QUARTET
tracked in the four path, ranged up outside of the leading pair to vie three deep turning for home, wrestled an advantage in upper stretch, clung between
horses as an outer pair joined the fray passing the sixteenth pole, but was bested by those bidders in the late stages. CLASSIC KING took light contact from
an inner rival soon after the start, pressed the leader form the three path, prompted between horses around the bend before vying with his outer counterpart
entering the lane, fought on through midstretch while headed but yielded with a sixteenth to go. IMPROBABLE STORY raced close up along the inside,
chased under heavy urging turning for home, aimed two wide and between horses in upper stretch, but lacked the needed punch. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS
brushed an outer rival a stride after the start, set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer pair around the turn, yielded to them approaching the lane and
weakened.

Footnotes
BEAR RIVER showed the way along the inside as an outer rival applied mild pressure, met that one's bid entering the lane, turned him away as another foe
took up chase entering the final furlong and held well through the late stages. SKETCH (IRE) stalked behind the leader and from the two path, took aim
outside of the leader while claiming place from an outer foe at the furlong grounds, menaced a danger but was kept at bay thereafter. RUN CARSON
bumped with an outer rival at the start, pressed the leader from the three path, bid entering the lane, but was turned away while losing place to an inner rival
at the furlong grounds and yielded. OKIRO bumped with an inner rival a the start, tracked in the three path and lacked a bid. HOLD MY BOURBON bumped
the gate while rank and off slow, pursued from off of the pace along the inside and failed to menace. PRINCE OF POWER trailed in the three path and got
outrun.

away hanging on her left lead. BAYTOWN LOVELY raced at the rear in the three path, shifted out to the five to six path in upper stretch, ran on to bid for
place at the sixteenth pole and wrestled that position in the closing stagses. JE SUIS RAPIDE tracked in the three path, got floated four wide entering the
lane, gained place passing the furlong pole but was bested by an outer bidder for that position in the late stages. CRACKALACKING set the pace along the
inside, got headed by the eventual winner reaching the three furlong pole, gave way to that one entering the lane and faded. SPARKLE OF HOPE stalked

Footnotes
MOVIN' ON UP stalked three wide, bid outside of the leader while well in hand entering the lane, dueled and wrestled an advantage in midstretch, then
inched ahead. SPARTAN QUEEN showed the way along the inside, dug in to resist an outer challenge entering the lane, dueled but was headed in
midstretch and proved second best. MRS. ASTOR tracked from midpack two to three wide, claimed show before tipping to the four path entering the lane,
then failed to threaten the top pair and held show. ROBIN SAGE broke a step slow, settled off of the pace in the two path, tipped out around the far turn
before fanning to the five path entering the lane, then ran on mildly but was fended off for show. YARBOROUGH tracked along the inside, but was shuffled
back behind a faltering foe around the far turn, surpassed that one entering the lane and failed to menace. TARNEEMA broke a beat slow, trailed in the
three to four path and failed to factor. EVITA pressed two wide and between the eventual top pair, but faded around the far turn.
