Footnotes
HYDRO FROST bobbled a bit at the start and was off a step slowly, was allowed to settle in the early running, never far back through the backstretch run,
was guided two to three wide and between runners into the second turn, split rivals into the stretch and loomed nearing the furlong pole, took command into
the final sixteenth, dug in while under pressure in deep stretch and determinedly held for the win at the finish. ACCLIDER forwardly placed in the early
running, stalked the pace four wide into the first turn, maintained an outside path through the backstretch run, chased three to four wide into the far turn and
ran in pursuit into upper stretch, rallied into the final sixteenth, pressured HYDRO FROST in deep stretch but could not get by the determined winner and
just missed at the wire, while holding clearly for second. ROARING TIGER raced close up to the early pace while three wide, advanced into the backstretch
run and prompted the decent pace nearing the half-mile marker, went two wide into the far turn and took command at the quarter pole, led into the stretch
and held foes at bay nearing the furlong grounds, was overtaken into the final sixteenth, yielded to the top pair in deep stretch and held safely for third. DEO
away in good order, ceded the early lead to OH GREAT and stalked from the inside heading into the backstretch run, was well placed while saving ground
nearing the half-mile marker, maintained an inside path into the far turn and lost position at the quarter marker, angled out in the stretch, re-rallied in the final
sixteenth but could not reel in the leaders in deep stretch. OH GREAT (IRE) sent in the early going, assumed command into the first turn and set decent
fractions into the backstretch run, set a prompted pace to the half-mile marker, was overtaken into the second turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and
faded. IT AINT OVER took back in the early stages, lagged through the backstretch run and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DEFENSOR FORTIS sent leaving the start, ceded the early lead to APPLE WARRIOR and stalked that runner through moderate fractions heading into the
turn, chased three wide approaching the quarter marker, was fanned five to six wide into upper stretch, recovered and vied for the lead at the furlong
marker, took command past mid-stretch and drew away in the late stages to be prevail as much the best. APPLE WARRIOR hustled away from the start,
assumed early command and set moderate fractions heading to the half-mile marker, dictated terms two wide into the turn, was impeded by the loose horse
into upper stretch, recovered and re-bid at the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth and outfinished MARK LOVES
ANN to secure the place honors. MARK LOVES ANN rated off of the moderate early pace, was guided two wide into the turn and gained ground at the
quarter marker, maintained an inside path into upper stretch and took a narrow lead approaching the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner
into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second in deep stretch. ST BOADIN took back off of the moderate early pace, tracked two wide into the turn,
chased into upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. EXTRA BEAT was bumped at the start and broke a bit slowly, settled off of the moderate early
pace, trailed to the quarter marker and did not factor in the stretch. FORD FLYER was away in good order, ducked in at the gap leaving the start and lost
the rider at that station, impeded APPLE WARRIOR into upper stretch, was caught following the race and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE START INVOLVING FORD FLYER. THE STEWARDS DETERMINED FORD FLYER CAUSED HIS OWN ISSUES AT THE START
AND NO CHANGE WOULD BE MADE. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most
accurate time.

Footnotes
ORIGINAL broke well but ceded the lead to SENSEMAKER through the first turn, then took closer order down the backstretch, stalked to the outside while
always traveling well, went to challenge for the lead a the quarter pole, pulled ahead in upper stretch and won clear under steady handling. WELLSWORT
(IRE) reserved from the break but was up close behind the leading pair going into the first turn, went three wide into the far turn and was put into a drive with
three furlongs to go, loomed a big threat at the top of the stretch, finished well but could not match strides with the winner and was easily second best.
LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) lagged behind the field in the early going, launched a sustained bid before the seven-sixteenths pole, saved some ground through
the far turn then came into the stretch in the two path then tipped out to the four path before the furlong marker, was gaining ground down the stretch but
was too late. SENSEMAKER was hustled to the front and cleared the field well before the first turn with ORIGINAL tracking behind, led the field through
reasonable fractions, then gave way when challenged at the quarter pole and tired in the stretch. ECOLOGIST was not inclined to lead from the break and
was near the back was given shake of the reins before the turn then checked slightly off heels going into the first turn, tracked mid-pack down the
backstretch, went into drive near the three furlong pole but could not offer the needed response and finished evenly. WRONG DIRECTION stumbled coming
out of the gate, recovered well and got an inside trip through the first turn, just behind the pace, held position through the far turn then had little to offer in the
stretch. STAY LIT got caught three wide through the first turn, was being ridden to keep up down the backstretch then came under heavy pressure on the
far turn dropped to last and was unable to improve down the stretch.

Footnotes
AMERICAN FARMER settled just off of the early pace, never far back through the backstretch run, chased two wide into the far turn, angled four wide at the
quarter marker and was set down for the drive, vied for the lead into upper stretch, took command and kicked clear at the furlong marker, pulled away into
the final sixteenth and was geared down in deep stretch to prevail as much the best. MOBOU prominent leaving the start, vied for the early lead then ceded
to ANITANEWMERCEDES into the first turn, stalked that rival through modest fractions into the backstretch run, prompted the pace to the half-mile pole
then battled outside of ANITANEWMERCEDES into the far turn, vied for the lead into upper stretch, was outkicked by AMERICAN FARMER at the furlong
pole, was no match for his stablemate into the final sixteenth and held well for second. MOGOLLON RIM unhurried in the early going, was content to trail
nearing the half-mile marker, altered course to avoid a fallen rival nearing the quarter marker and was roused five wide into the stretch, closed well into the
final sixteenth and got up in the final strides for third. ANITANEWMERCEDES broke alertly and vied for the early lead, assumed command into the first turn
and set a modest pace into the backstretch run, was prompted by MOBOU nearing the half-mile marker, battled inside of that rival into the far turn, could not
keep pace nearing the furlong marker, gave way in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for third. HEAT N REHEAT forwardly placed leaving the start,
tracked the early pace three wide into the first turn, maintained an outside path into the backstretch run and was well placed nearing the half-mile marker,
mounted a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace nearing mid-stretch and weakened in the late stages. J D'S RUDE BOY was
allowed to settle, saved ground into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run while not far back nearing the half-mile marker, saved ground
into the far turn, lost action nearing the quarter marker, unseated the rider in upper stretch, was caught following the race and was transported off of the
track via equine ambulance.

Footnotes
SKY MAKER took a slight bump from MAGIC LIGHT at the break then was unhurried early, raced in the back of the field despite the slow pace, seemed
content with that position to the far turn, then was set down passing the three furlong marker, circled the field, came into the stretch five wide and produced
a bold rally to get up in plenty of time. PROOF OF JAZZ jumped out quickly to the early lead, had GRACE PERIOD (FR) in close attendance but was
allowed to set very slow fractions with that rival content to stalk to the outside, held sway to the far turn, was finally let loose approaching the quarter pole,
responded well to strong handling in the stretch, led past the furlong pole then was outfinished in the final yards in a solid effort. GRACE PERIOD (FR)
came away well and was content to stalk PROOF JAZZ from just behind and to the outside, applied only minimal pressure on that foe despite the slow
pace, went to challenge near the quarter pole but struggled to get past, finished well then was passed late for second. AURATIUM saved ground mid-pack
to the far turn, made a mild bid up the rail down the stretch but could not sustain and was outkicked to the wire. MAGIC LIGHT broke in and made light
contact with SKY MAKER after the break, was held up and went two wide turning into the stretch for the first time, then got floated four wide through the first
turn, moved up to third position down the backstretch just behind the leaders, started to run on with about three furlongs to run, loomed a threat at the top of
the stretch but flattened out. GADDING broke well then became rank when taken ahold of going into the first turn, went three wide while carrying MAGIC
LIGHT out, continued to fight the rider through that first turn then settled for the backstretch run, came under heavy pressure on the far turn and did not run
on in the stretch.

Footnotes
CROWN MAGIC was bumped at the start by a neighboring rival and was away slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, trailed into the turn and and saved
ground nearing the quarter marker, shifted three wide for the drive and advanced nearing the furlong pole, shifted widest nearing the sixteenth-marker,
closed fast into deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. UPLIFT settled off of the decent early pace, raced outside of rivals into the turn and
advanced three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, loomed while widest into upper stretch and battled for the lead nearing the furlong marker, took a
narrow advantage into the final sixteenth, was caught in the final strides by the oncoming winner and held safely at the finish for second. BERTACCHI was
forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the decent early pace from the outside heading to the half-mile marker, chased three wide into the turn, vied
for the lead into upper stretch and took a narrow lead approaching the furlong marker, met the bid of UPLIFT into the final sixteenth, grudgingly gave way in
deep stretch and was outkicked by the leading pair, while clear of the rest for third. CONEJO MALO was prominent away from the start, rated just off of the
decent early pace and tracked from the inside heading to the turn, saved ground along the bend then waited for racing room nearing the quarter marker,
angled three wide in upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, could not muster the needed late response and finished evenly. RIOLO hustled
away from the start, pulled between rivals heading to the half-mile marker and contested the decent pace approaching the turn, lost position into the bend
and chased the leading pair two wide nearing the quarter pole, slipped to the rail in upper stretch and ran in pursuit to the furlong marker, could not keep
pace past mid-stretch and gave way. WHAT A RELIEF broke alertly and assumed command away from the gate, set a pressured pace heading to the
half-mile marker, dictated terms into the turn while off of the rail, was overtaken into upper stretch, could not keep pace into the final furlong and tired.
GALLOPING MAJOR broke out at the start and bothered CROWN MAGIC away from the gate, was allowed to settle in the early running, raced outside of
rivals into the turn and was guided two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch drive and did not factor.
