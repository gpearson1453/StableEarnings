FAST FREEZE KAZ dueled for the lead on the outside, two wide on the turn and made a bid to gain a short lead nearing the furlong marker and then kicked
clear to prove best, driving. JAKE BRAKE ALLEY dueled for the lead on the inside, then could not match strides with the winner by the furlong marker,
angled off the inside at the sixteenth marker and held the place award. GOING AT IT was settled early on the outside, angled in to be on the inside by the
five sixteenths, swung out five wide leaving the turn and had a mild late rally. ROAN FOR THE ROSE chased the pace and was four to five wide on the turn
and came six wide off the turn and weakened. CHUCKA MOON stalked the pace three wide and came four wide off the turn and came up empty.

BRADITUDE was away alertly to be soon clear to set the early pace on the inside, drew out on the turn and then widened the margin off the turn and then
was kept to crop pressure to prove best while remaining clear. NOBLE JON stalked the pace and then chased the winner two wide and ran on to the wire to
be clearly second best. CHEERS FOR KITTEN chased the pace three wide and angled in by the quarter pole but needed a bid on the inside and held the
show award. MARATHONER was rated along on the inside and swung out four wide leaving the turn but had no kick while racing evenly. DECLARATION
TIME was outrun early, inside into the lane and angled out in the drive to have a belated rally. FADETHENOISE was settled back early, came four wide into
the lane and improved position late. SHAKE THE GOLD was bumped at the start, settled early and was three wide on the turn and had no rally. PARK
PLACE was settled and saved ground on the turn and was not a threat. CAMULUS broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, settled early and was in
between rivals and weakened.

Footnotes
MAGGIE K vied for the lead three wide, then made a bid and went on to set the pace and move to the inside by the half mile marker, then drew out on the
turn and widened the margin in the lane to prove much the best, driving. FOXEY G chased the early pace on the outside, then made a four to three wide
move on the turn but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. ENSUING GRACE tracked the pace three to four wide and came five
wide off the turn but was no match to the top two wide besting the rest. JUMP A FOX was settled two wide and advanced on the inside on the turn but
weakened in the drive. TRACE MARTINIS was reserved on the inside, angled out in the lane and found best stride late. FORCEZILLA vied for the lead on
the inside and tired.
