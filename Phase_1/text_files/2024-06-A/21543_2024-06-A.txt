Footnotes
TRY TRY AGAIN was off mid pack in the second tier, race in between rivals as they were tracking the leader, was given the cue and willingly responded
after the three eighths pole, improved position, joined a set of three in the stretch battling for the lead, matched strides with this group then pulled away in
the last sixteenth securing the win. BERNIE LOMAX stalked the pace setter from the two path, advanced at the quarter pole, drew next to the early leader
and challenged for the lead, battled, collared by an outside closer but held for second place honors. WILDWOOD MINISTRY raced from off of the pace
along the rail, started to improve after the half mile marker, saved ground, moved at the quarter pole and joined the leaders briefly from the inside, tried to go
by but did not have enough and evened out finishing third. MALIGATOR raced off of the pace in the five path, advanced along the outside joining the
second tier down the back side, chased into the stretch, out finished the rest. REMEMBER THE MAINE trailed through out, never involved. RIVZONAROLL
speed, set the pace, was challenged and battled in the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
JOCELYN broke well and was first out, settled into a stalking position, raced in the two path while waiting for the cue, starting moving after the three eighths
pole, passed the early leader near the quarter pole and drew off in the stretch for the win. HOLY IMAGE was off slow, raced five wide, moved at the half
mile pole, improved position, shifted out in the upper stretch and was put to task, was encouraged and ridden through out the stretch passing each rival
slowly but surely, was no match for the winner but was second best today. SAPPHIRE NIGHTS raced mid pack in the two path, improved position after the
half mile pole, continued to gain ground through the turn, was ion contention in the upper stretch but had no late kick and finished even. FANCY HILL was
off mid pack then took herself back a bit, raced in the three path, was asked at the half mile pole and responded well, gained ground through the turn, saved
ground and shifted into the rail in the upper stretch, was encouraged but needed more room, shifted out mid stretch but finished even. GOLD OAK was sent
to the lead, raced along the rail, saved ground, then faded. EVIE JEAN raced from off of the pace, raced on the inside in the first and second paths, moved
at the half and gained ground through the turn matching strides with another rival, shifted into the rail after the quarter pole in the upper stretch, needed
more room, shifted out into the five path in mid stretch but to no avail. HIP HOP EMMY in tight early, checked after the break, tailed through out then eased
late.

had to check, shifted out into the four path leaving he first turn, started to gain ground and improving position down the back side, moved after the half mile
pole, quickly gained ground through the second turn then hit a wall of horses entering the upper stretch, waited to find a hole for s few strides, then was
covered up on the outside by closing rivals, pushed her way out after the eighth mile pole, had racing room and was encouraged with a left handed whip,
found more, was flagged and hand ridden, collared the leader in the last stride getting the win.l. BABE IN THE WOODS led out of the gates, raced on the
rail, was passed in the first turn and settled into a stalking position, saved ground and tracked the leader down the back side, gained through the second
turn, challenged by the quarter pole, battled, shook one, out lasted the other, was on the lead and nearing the wire, was caught by a determined outside
closer and settled for second. REDHEADEDSTRANGER vied for the lead, raced in the two and three path, took command leaving the first turn, edged out in
front by several lengths, willingly set the pace, was challenged near the quarter pole, fanned wide entering the upper stretch, battled a rival to the outside
and inside for the first eighth pf a mile in the stretch, could not sustain the bid and faded back to third. SAFECRACKER SUE raced off of the pace in the two

rail entering the upper stretch, was encouraged and kept on point and passed the wire with a un surmountable lead. PIRATE MARMALADE was off slow
and trailed, raced two wide, was allowed to settle, moved after the half mile pole, found best stride moving out of the turn and entering the stretch, raced in
the two path and closed quickly, shifted out into the six path after the last sixteenth, out finished the second running rival but was no match for the winner.
MALIBU BRAD stalked the pace setter from the three path, maintained the same position through out, then was caught late and settled for third. LARRY'S
LUNCHBOX was off mid pack, raced in the three path, advanced at the three eighths pole and improved position, was in contention, finished flat. KEYSER
was off slow, raced off of the pace in the four path, was encouraged near the half mile pole, improved position, shifted over to the rail through the turn
entered the stretch then faltered. RAISERICHIESRANSOM mid pack, inside along the rail, had to steady at the five furlong pole and raced even. CHERRY

Footnotes
ALL CHOKED UP vied for the lead, set the pace, maintained the lead through out, and finished on top with the win. TEMPLE FOOL stalked the leader from
the two path, followed the winner all the way around the track proving to be second best today. MOONRISE DRIVE raced mid pack, stayed on the rail,
maintained the same position through out and was good enough for third. COOL AND COLLECTED took back early, raced three wide and settled in mid
pack, started plight at the half mile pole, improving position, shifted out in the upper stretch then finished flat. NATHANIEL'S HOPE stalked the leaders from
the four path, but had no kick. ALVIN raced mid pack and three wide, but made no impact. ELECTRIC CHARGE trailed early, stayed on the rail, saved
ground, made one run, passed tired ones in the stretch. DASTARDLY DEEDS off pace, three and four wide, was no factor. KINGSBURRY ATTACK vied for
the lead, stalked from the four path, raced in between rivals and was done by the quarter pole. ICE AXE rank early, struggled to settle, no finish.
