into upper stretch, stayed on determinedly and held late under a driving finish. BOX A ROCKS came away last at the start but was never far back, moved up
close to sit off the top trio mid-way around the turn, given cue three wide turning for home, responded, steadily advanced down the lane and was getting to
the winner late. GOVENOR HANK vied inside of HEY from the onset and battled on into the turn, could not match strides with the eventual winner
approaching the quarter pole, saved ground into the lane and churned on for a share. SAMMY'S A GIVINE was never too far back in early stages, hustled
along three wide around the turn, came four paths wide into upper stretch and gave way. HEY took a slim lead soon after the start then vied outside of
GOVENOR HANK, continued to match strides into the turn, could not move on approaching the quarter pole and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
UPTOWN SOCIAL was the closest pursuer of the clear leader up the backstretch, edged closer then launched a two wide bid near the quarter pole, took
over the lead in upper stretch and finished going away. BLACK STORM sat back off the pace in the early going, was ridden along the inside around the turn,
cut the corner entering upper stretch, roused forward along the rail down the lane and gained second best. GRAND DESIGN tracked the leader in opening
stages, hustled up three wide around the turn, ran on three paths wide through the lane and secured a share. LOVER BOY quickly took control over the
lead steps out of the gate, cleared and crossed over to the inside, led the way around the turn, got collared by the eventual winner in upper stretch and
steadily weaekened. BROADWAY PETE hustled along in pursuit into the turn while saving ground, came two wide into upper stretch, ran on but needed
more for serious impact. ONCE UPON A DREAM broke share but lacked speed and quickly dropped to the back, continued in or near the rear up the
backstretch and around the turn, hustled along two wide into upper stretch, gathered momentum in final stages but was too late to threaten. TUFF WILLY
TE was not too far back in opening stages then steadily weakened.

Footnotes
SHEMEANSBIZNESS vied for the lead up the backstretch then shook free upon entering the turn, led the way by a narrow margin then cut the corner and
given cue entering the lane, dug in on top under firm handling, appeared all out late but continued to put in a game effort and just lasted. INTERSTELLA
was well position racing just off the pace in the opening quarter, continued unasked into the turn then picked up the pace past the quarter pole, swung four
paths wide into upper stretch, responded gamely when called upon, closed willingly but was too late to get by the winner. FLAT OUT STORMIN edged
closer along the rail just past the half mile marker, then waited and flattened along the inside around the turn, shifted out three wide a furlong out, surged
late and captured a share. DEMIDANU vied for the lead with the eventual winner up the backstretch, weakened off of rival entering the turn but remained in
contention along the inside, ran on one paced in range into the final furlong then flattened late. OURPEPPERMINTCANDY lacked speed and raced in the
back, was ridden three wide around the turn, came three to four wide into the drive and showed interest in final stages. ROCKETS SISTER raced in range
then launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, ran on into the lane then evened out in the final sixteneth. ANGEL'S MELODY vied in opening stages
then edged back into tracking position, launched a two wide rebid around the turn, sustained bid to mid-stretch then gave way.

SINCERELY MINE was well rated racing just out of striking range in early stages, edged up a bit closer approaching the quarter pole, given cue two wide at
the head of the lane, responded gamely, roused forward, took over the lead from DAWSONS STORM in the final sixteenth and edged away. DAWSON'S
STORM sat in good position just off the compact top flight near the half mile marker, let out a notch and quickly advanced to poke a head out in front at the
quarter pole, cleared command and angled in at the head of the lane then got overtaken late. KILLIAN raced in range between foes near the half mile
marker, flattened around the turn, launched a rebid in upper stretch, showed response and captured show. SPECIALSORTASTORM was forwardly placed
from the onset then took a slim lead with three furlongs left to run, got collared by DAWSONS STORM late on the turn, ran on into the lane and flattened in
late stages. CASA LIMON vied inside for the early lead, stayed in striking distance around the turn, continued in contention into the lane then gave way in
the final furlong. TEE OFF TIME was off slow at the start, lacked speed and raced in the back, hustled along the turn but failed to progress under pressure,
shifted out wider at the head of the lane and showed some interest in final stages. STROLLER BOY rated off the compact field going by the half mile
marker, chased three wide around the turn and lacked a rally in the lane. MC COUGAR pressed the pace along the opening quarter, weakened entering the
turn and failed to regain. FREEDOM TO SPEED bumped with rival at the start, raced up close in the opening quarter then gave way. PER HISA RULING
#20274-00543, SINCERELY MINE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO EXCESSIVE WHIP STRIKES.

Footnotes
MY CAJUN LADY raced in range along the inside, tipped two wide around the turn, shaken up three wide for the drive, steadily edged up closer and got by
ACCELERATING BABE in final stages. ACCELERATING BABE dueled inside for the lead up the backstretch, edged back along the rail around the turn, cut
the corner and launched a rail rebid at the head of the lane, dug in gamely, roused forward to the lead then got worn down in final stages. SCOOT ALONG
dueled outside of the eventual winner up the backstretch, shook free and led the way around the turn, got collared when aforementioned foe came back on
in upper stretch, ran on then evened out late and finished on equal terms for show with BETTY JO. BETTY JO came away quickly from the gate then
conceded position and tracked the early pace, was ridden three wide around the turn, swung four paths wide into upper stretch, gathered momentum and
got up to finish on equal terms with SCOOT ALONG for show. MORNING GORDITA sat off the top two flights going by the half, swung five wide into the
lane and lacked a needed rally. READY FOR WINE raced up close in the opening quarter, weakened three furlongs from home and never regained close
contention. BIT A BAD NEWS lacked speed and never menaced.
