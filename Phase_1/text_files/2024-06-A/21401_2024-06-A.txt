Footnotes
BLING BLING BLING was squeezed back at the start, then raced at the tail of the field, was advancing on the turn while in a strong bid, came out five wide
and found the best stride in the late stretch to be up in time to prove best. TURN NORTH was impeded at the start, then settled between rivals in the back
flight, continued to save ground on the turn, then angled out four wide in the late stretch and closed willingly in the end just missing victory. FORT HOOD
chased the pace from the two path, remained well rated along the rail on the turn, rallied gamely in the upper stretch to vie for the lead then was out finished
by BLING BLING BLING and held onto the show prize in the end. CREDIT RATING was brushed at the start, then settled in the back flight while three wide,
rallied leaving the bend while shifting out to the six path and was closing well in the end. WILL THE THRILL stalked the pace while three wide, was in a
strong drive throughout the turn, rallied in the upper stretch to vie briefly for the lead, then was out finished in the end. SUNDAY BLING stalked the pace
while two deep, then bid on the turn to rally mildly in the stretch then was out finished in the end. CARBON STRYKER was reluctant to load, then raced flat
throughout while chasing the pace and needed rally in the end. MY LITTLE PRINCE showed the way down the backstretch, was in a hard drive on the turn,
was over powered by rivals then faltered in the stretch. TURN ON THE BLING veered outwardly and impeded rivals and failed to rally.

Footnotes
TEAM GORMLEY went shoulder to shoulder with an outer foe into the first turn, then stalked the emerging leader down the early backstretch, inched up to
spar briefly before taking command by a head on the far turn, then shook clear at the top of stretch and held on well down the lane to prove best.
ALLIGATOR CRAWL saved ground in the early stages along the rail, then came out four wide leaving the far bend to close well down the lane, besting the
rest of the field and was up for the place prize. OZZIES WINGS Y G tracked the pace from the inside in the early furlongs, then bid while three wide on the
far turn, lacked the winning stride to over take the leader and held onto the show prize while in a mild drive in the home stretch. KING ARTHUR RIDGE was
bumped at the start and was no threat. MORO MAFIA sparred with an inner foe into the first turn, then led the way while two wide in the early backstretch,
was confronted by said rival at the half to duel into the far turn, was in a hard drive throughout, was used up and tired in the late stretch. SONNY BOB broke
inwardly and bumped rival and failed to rally.

Footnotes
MAGGIE D'CAUSE battled with inner foes early, then sparred with TEXAS RED BEL heading to the turn, was in an all out drive at the top of the stretch then
kicked clear in the final sixteenth to prevail in the end. TEXAS RED BEL vied from the inside, inched away to duel with MAGGIE d'CAUSE heading into the
turn, was in a long drive in the early stretch, then was out kicked in the final yards and was second best. WAVING BYE broke inwardly, then chased the
pace while three wide, bid from the inside while maintaining third position, could not catch the dueling leaders in the stretch and held onto the show prize in
the end. SHE DAZZLE chased the pace while four wide, then rallied on the turn and into the stretch but it was not enough in the end. ROZEY CHEEKS was
unhurried early, then rallied while five wide on the turn and into the stretch and came up empty. PROUD VALENTINE bid briefly for the lead between rivals,
then faded heading into the turn and did not rally in the stretch. POET LAUREATE was no threat. FREEZER BURN chased the pace while two wide, was in
a mild drive on the turn and did not fire in the stretch. OUR SOUTHERN GIRL was no factor.

SINGAPORE FLASH showed the way into the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch from the inside, remained in easy hand ride throughout the far
turn, then shifted gears to draw clear while drifting out in the late stretch proving best in the end. BOBBY BRINKLEY tracked the pace from the inside while
saving ground down the backstretch, then rallied gamely on the far turn to gain second position at the top of the stretch, could not catch the determined
leader and held onto the place prize in the end. STANS HOME RUN was unhurried early, saved ground down the backstretch, then came out three wide
leaving the far turn and was up for the show prize. IBERIAN RUNNER pressed the pace while two wide into the first turn, was in a long drive heading into
the far turn, could not over power the leader and gave way in the home stretch.

NO MAS TEQUILA was forwardly place along the inside into the first turn, then dueled with an outer rival in the early backstretch, gained command at the
half pole, was threatened by outer foes leaving the far turn but lasted till the end to prove best overall. MISSINGYOUCRAZY pursued the pace while two
wide, was in a steady drive on the far turn, came out four wide in the upper stretch and was closing in on the leader and just missed victory in the end. TOO
MUCH KIKI was off slowly, then settled in the back duo along the rail, bid while four wide on the far turn then was improving down the lane to finish gamely
for the show prize. REASON OVER RICHES chased the pace from the inside in the early furlongs, then steadied slightly heading into the far turn, rebid from
the three path in the upper stretch but it was to no avail in the end. BLUSHING BELLE moved from three path into the first turn to duel with NO MAS
TEQUILA in the early backstretch, pressed the emerging leader on the far turn and while in a hard drive, was used up and flattened out in the stretch.
IMALUCKYCHARM tracked the pace while three wide down the backstretch, was moving up on the far turn to gain second position, lacked the winning bid
to overcome the leader then flattened out in the stretch. WILBURNSCLASSYLADY chased the pace while three wide down the backstretch and at a
moderate pace, then rallied on the far turn but did not fire in the stretch. ANTIFREEZE was no threat.

Footnotes
DUST EM pursued the pace from the inside, then gained command leaving the turn, met with TOO MUCH ACTION in the late stretch to duke it out till the
end and was up at the wire to prevail. TOO MUCH ACTION was allowed to settle at the back of the pack along the rail, then fanned out five wide leaving the
bend, dug in gamely to duel with DUST EM in the late stretch and hung at the wire. ZAVALA emerged to set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive
leaving the turn, then was out finished by rivals from both sides and maintain the show position in the end. ALGEBRA was impeded at the start, then
prompted the pace while two wide, was in a hard drive on the turn then gave way in the late stretch. JOSH'S DREAM chased the pace while two wide and
between rivals, was in a mild rally on the far turn and did no spark in the lane. GOLD PILOT was off slowly and no threat. LIL SWEET THANG was no
threat. SHARP LORENZO drifted out at the start and bumped rival, then chased the pace from the three path into the turn, was in a mild drive then lacked
rallying in the stretch.
