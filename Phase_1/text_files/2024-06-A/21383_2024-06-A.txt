Footnotes
CHASING SHADOWS bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path, began
a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground to kick clear late. VOW pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the
four path and was caught in late stretch. SAINT SARENA bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate, recovered to duel on the rail through the
opening quarter, continued to battle while saving ground around the bend and into the lane and gave way late. TWELVE STARS bumped with the horse to
her outside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and never
threatened. SEA LEVEL raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, came around the bend in the two path and showed no kick. MIA BABY dueled
between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and tired in the lane.
