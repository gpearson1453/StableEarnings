Footnotes
CALIFORNIA CODE stalked from the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, was
carried out leaving the turn but dug in for the lead later yards and inched clear under the wire. LANETTA veered out and made contact with. NANA'S
BOOPA leaving the gate then took the lead and moved to the inside to show the way, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, contested the
edge nearest the rail on the far turn, drifted entering the stretch and dueled at even terms to mid-stretch before beginning to relent. The latter exchanged
contact with Dream of Gold leaving the gate and was pinched back a stride later, raced in the four path on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened in the lane. SUMMERTIME ROSE settled in the three path the first turn, angled
to the outside past the half mile pole and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and ran evenly in the lane.
DREAM OF GOLD exchanged contact with Lanetta leaving the gate, raced in the five path on the first turn and picked up the chase from the three eighths
pole, but flattened in the four path on the far turn. GET A GRIP MARILYN rated close inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at
the rail and weakened in the lane. WAVERLEY saved early ground and showed little response through the backstretch.

ROMAN CANDLE rated close in the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the nod in the three path approaching the eighth
pole, was carried out leaving the far turn but dug in from that point and drew clear late yards. SOMESUGARNSPICE raced with the pace inside, dueled for
the lead approaching the five sixteenths pole and contested the edge off the rail on the far turn, drifted leaving the turn and relented the final sixteenth.
LUCKY BOP rated close in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and
finished well to take third mid-stretch. JUST HAVE FAITH raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
in the four path, angled to the outside leaving the turn then flattened late yards. PARALLAX VIEW bobbled a stride from the gate then saved ground on the
first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and flattened in the lane. XTRAORDINARYMOTION raced with
the pace two deep and dueled leaving the three eighths pole, was met toward the five sixteenths, dropped back off the rail midway on the far turn and
weakened in the lane. Frenchies Gold broke through the gate prior the start, ran loose on the track and was a late scratch.

Footnotes
BLAMEITONTHEFUN angled to the inside and took the lead past the mile marker and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the half mile pole,
widened at the rail on the far turn, dug in while drifting out past the eighth pole and was steadily handled to hold on. I AM THAT I AM steadied off the heels
of Road Slew in the vicinity of the mile pole then settled inside, eased out leaving the second turn and bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on
the far turn and was gaining slowly in deep stretch. TOP OF THE MINT settled in the four path, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced
at the rail on the far turn and dueled to clear third mid-stretch. MARK DID IT settled back off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole
and improved off the rail on the far turn. ROAD SLEW steadied off the heels of I Am That I Am in the vicinity of the mile pole then stalked from the three and
four paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path, left the turn outside and showed little more. RRACE DAY
WARRIOR stalked from the three path, picked up the chase leaving the there eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and weakened in the lane.
TRANSFER THE FUNDS was shuffled back early then saved ground and could only improve his position. ANTIPOISON stalked from the three path, picked
up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and weakened. WELLING was not a factor. UNANIMOUS CONSENT
(GB) stalked the early pace off the rail, gave chase into the backstretch but weakened past the three eighths pole. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected a
claim of foul against the rider of Blameitonthefun for alleged interference in the stretch, lodged by the rider of I Am That I Am.

Footnotes
BONNIE BILL raced in the five path the first turn, challenged nearing the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage three wide on the far
turn, dueled at near even terms leaving the turn and dug in determinedly to take the nod in the final strides. ALPHA CHI RHO stalked off the rail then
challenged approaching the three eighths pole, took the nod two deep while between horses nearing the quarter pole, dug in under steady handling leaving
the far turn but was caught in the final strides. FLAMING EAST rated a slim lead, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, gave up the lead at
the rail toward the quarter, was steadily handled leaving the far turn but relented mid-stretch. CAPE LOOKOUT settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and showed little more. INDIANA RED raced well back while saving early ground,
gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five and six paths and showed little in the lane. DIXIE CANNONBALL mostly
saved ground. CLAW stalked from the four path the first turn then faded through the backstretch.
