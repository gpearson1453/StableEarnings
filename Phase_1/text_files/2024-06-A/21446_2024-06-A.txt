Footnotes
PYROTECHNICS was well placed along the inside, made a inside bid on the turn to duel for command by the quarter pole, then drew clear leaving the
bend, then held sway late to prove best under a drive. RAINAS ROLLIN stalked the pace three wide on the turn, came five wide off the bend and finished
well. MY MASTERPIECE tracked the pace and was two wide on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and rallied. ARROGANTE chased the pace
and was three wide on the turn but had no punch in the drive. PRIZE DEBATE was settled early, two wide by the quarter pole and had a belated rally.
FIREBALL EXPRESS was fractious in the gate, set the pace in the two path, then dueled for the lead by the quarter pole and weakened in the drive.
VIROLOGIST was fractious in the gate, settled early, four wide on the turn and had no rally. SOPHIA'S ROSE was settled early, saved ground on the turn
and had no rally.

Footnotes
RYE DIGGITYDOG chased the early pace on the outside, four wide on the turn and came five wide off the bend, then closed well under left handed crop
urging to draw away to prove best. PLUOT was outrun early, angled out in the lane and closed the gap fast late to get the place award. TACTICAL HUMOR
was away alertly to set the early pace in the two path, then was clear on the turn on the inside and was still clear by the furlong marker but could not go with
the winner and lost the place award on the wire. RUMORS TO BLAME chased the pace and was in between rivals on the turn, came three wide and
finished willingly but needed more, missed show award. RUBIDOR chased the pace on the inside and tipped out two wide leaving the turn but flattened out.
ROLLY showed good early speed towards the inside, moved out and was two to three wide on the turn, came four wide off the bend and weakened.
VIBRANT FORCE broke in the air at the start,was settled early on the outside,got out on the turn and was eased in the lane, walked off.

Footnotes
CURLINGTON was well rated three wide, came five wide off the bend and closed well in the final furlong to draw clear to prove best under a drive. CRAZY
KATER was rated along while saving ground, made a inside bid leaving the turn to go on even terms for the lead by the furlong marker, but was out-kicked
by the winner while saving the place award. LAKE NAKURU was reserved early on the inside, moved out on the far turn and was four wide by the quarter
pole, came six wide off the bend and rallied well late to just miss the place award. RESTORED ORDER was away alertly to set the pace while clear on the
inside, then was headed nearing the furlong marker and faded late. SIR SAHIB tracked the pace three wide and made a two wide bid on the far turn but
flattened out in the lane. WICKED MAD was allowed to settle on the inside but lacked the needed winning bid. JO JO KATZ was reserved three wide and
was four wide by the quarter pole but had no rally. WHISKEYMAC was void of early speed, five wide on the far turn and came very wide into the lane and
had no rally. RECONVENE tracked the pace in between rivals four to three wide and tired. MERU was five wide into the first turn, chased the pace on the
outside and stopped.

GUN COLLECTOR prompted the pace on the outside, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole and took over leaving the three sixteenths and was clear by
the furlong marker and kicked away under right handed crop urging. BAZINGA D chased the early pace and was four wide on the turn, shifted out in the
lane and finished willingly to be second best. PICTURE THIS was settled early, advanced on the turn and came three wide off the turn, angled in and
finished on the inside but was out-kicked for the place award. LILTONYTWOPHONES dueled for the lead three wide, made a bid and was between rivals by
the quarter pole but faded in the final furlong. SKIMBLE SHANKS was reserved early, came six wide into the lane and passed the tiring rivals. LUCKY
LINUS lacked a rally. UNIFIED BY CANDY dueled for the lead on the inside and faltered in the lane. BOOK RUNNER was reserved early on the inside and
was never a factor. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE

TIZ SPEEDY was slow into stride and then chased the pace four wide, then was four to three wide on the turn while stalking the pace, then made a three
wide bid when straighten and edged clear in the furlong grounds to prove best under a drive. SPORTING THE GOLD set a pressured pace while in the two
path, then was clear on the inside by the quarter pole, widened the margin off the turn but was headed nearing the sixteenth marker and then could not go
with the winner and held the place award late. MALIBU'S BOSS MAN was rated along two wide, moved out on the turn and was four wide by the quarter
pole and came five wide off the bend and rallied to just miss the place award. LUCKY DANCER stalked the early pace three wide, then tracked the pace two
wide on the turn, then had no punch in the lane. ON THE RIM was settled early, made a five wide move on the turn to loom boldly by the quarter pole but
flattened out in the lane. NORTHWOODS was close up early on the inside, then was shuffled back to trail the field, moved out on the turn and was five wide
by the quarter pole and came six wide off the turn and finished with interest. CHUCK ADAMS pressed the early pace towards the inside and then dropped
back on the turn. THIS RACE HAD A TIMING DISCREPANCY OR MALFUNCTION AND WAS RE-TIMED USING VIDEO TECHNOLOGY TO ARRIVE AT
THE MOST ACCURATE TIME.
