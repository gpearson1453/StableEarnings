Footnotes
SWITZER came in at the break, stalked the pace while three wide around the turn, advanced to gain the lead near the sixteenth pole and lasted under brisk
urging. BOSS MAN J J raced along the inner rail around the turn and in upper stretch, moved out in mid stretch and closed gamely between rivals.
CLAUDEE BOY bumped with SUSTENANCE leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, eased out to the three path turning for home and rallied
outside the top pair. BURNINGUPTHEDOUGH set a pressured pace along the inner rail and weakened in the drive. SUSTENANCE bumped with
CLAUDEE BOY leaving the starting gate, chased the pace and weakened. SUGA STEVE was outrun after being pinched back leaving the starting gate.
SPEAKERIT , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was outrun. FLASH IS BACK , four wide turning for home, was not a factor. OUTKISSED bore in
leaving the starting gate prompted the pace outside BURNINGUPTHEDOUGH and faltered.

Footnotes
ASCRIBE broke outward and bumped with CORONATION TIME, corrected and raced close up while off the inside, angled out leaving the far turn then
rolled up four deep to threaten approaching the stretch, took over soon after, spurted away while being flashed the stick leaving mid stretch, eagerly
responded to a right handed ask near the sixteenth pole then drew out. CORONATION TIME , bumped at the start, regrouped and tracked the leaders three
wide, bid between foes while under asking past the three eighths, forced the issue into the stretch, gave willing pursuit of the winner past mid stretch, faded
late but managed to save the place. RIGHT QUICK rated close up while saving ground, had aim off the embattled quartet of leaders nearing the stretch,
shifted out three to four wide then churned on. GENERAL J R , urged from the gate, dropped back between foes leaving the chute, lagged while saving
ground leaving the far turn, angled four wide into the lane but finished evenly. PURE REALIZATION grabbed command to the inside of a rival leaving the
chute then cleared, set the pace towards the inner rail, took pressure mid turn, stayed on past the three sixteenths then weakened. MINIMO forced the pace
outside the leader, was under pressure between runners approaching the lane, lacked a punch past the quarter pole then tired.

Footnotes
MONEY ROOM , brushed at the break, regrouped and pulled his way forward while saving ground, was tucked up tracking the leaders into the far turn,
eased out as the duel developed past the three eighths, circled four wide into the lane, moved to engage the leader nearing mid stretch, struck the top
heading to the sixteenth marker, briefly went clear then dug in under solid handling to prevail. MARGIE'S FUN SON was rated back from between runners
early, trailed but not far back under coaxing into the far turn, angled out and gained into the stretch, shifted out to be five to six wide past the three
sixteenths, closed gamely but was kept at bay. MINXZLUCKYSTARFYRE tracked off the inside, bid three deep around the far turn, sparred under a ride
past the five sixteenths, edged clear into the stretch, met an outside challenge near the eighth pole, fought on past the sixteenth marker then faded late.
ARMED AND READY broke inward, corrected and cleared, set the pace towards the inside, was joined by a pair of outer foes leaving the far turn, dueled
under a hustling ride to about the quarter pole and weakened. FINGER ROLL broke inward and brushed with the winner, straightened and stalked two to
three wide, bid between foes leaving the far turn, vied under a hearty ride to the quarter pole then faltered.

Footnotes
POWER BACK assumed the lead entering the first turn, set the pace along the inner rail and was under brisk urging in the drive. UNCLE CURLY saved
ground around the turns in a striking position and rallied. PRINCE PERE chased the pace while in the two path and weakened. CAERUS , a forward factor
in the two path between horses down the backstretch and around the far turn, weakened in the stretch. DAREDAVITE , four wide leaving the far turn,
passed tired horses. BONDED , three wide the far turn, weakened. JACKIE A , three wide both turns, chased the pace to upper stretch and tired.
ALIFEROUS , a long the inner rail most of the trip, gave way. AMERICAN D'ORO broke awkwardly when acting up at the break then was outrun.
HOMECOMING KING was outrun. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning AMERICAN D'ORO at the break but no action was taken.

BAD TEMPER , taken to rate while saving ground, eased out and was shoved along past the three eighths, worked between runners into the lane, shifted
out and closed in under a strong hand ride, took over from SWEET HEIDELBERG near the sixteenth marker and edged clear. SWEET HEIDELBERG sped
up to the inside of foes leaving the chute and took a short lead, set a pressured pace towards the inside, moved clear three wide and under a ride into the
stretch, dug in when collared from her outside leaving mid stretch, switched over to her left lead a sixteenth out then gave way grudgingly. HAPPY UNION
settled off the pace, saved ground into the lane, angled out leaving the quarter pole, moved up between runners while on her left lead and churned on. HOT
LOOKIN ROYAL , in range and outside a rival early on, raced three wide with pursuit into the stretch, shifted in past the three sixteenths but failed to
seriously follow through. PREPAREFORTAKEOFF showed speed to briefly lead then was rated back between runners leaving the chute, secured the inside
and stalked, failed to kick on past mid stretch and faded. KEEN CONTENDER , sluggish from the gate, lagged back then was put to a ride mid turn, raced
three wide in upper stretch but failed to generate a run. IRISH LACE , well placed stalking off the inside, had dead aim mid turn, shifted out five wide while
under a ride into the stretch, failed to kick on and faltered through the final furlong. MYSISTERNANCY forced the pace outside the leader, was under
pressure four wide soon into the lane, lacked a punch past the quarter pole and weakened.

Footnotes
SHAFT'S BULLET , between foes into the backstretch, edged up and was the closest pursuer of AIN'T DA BEER COLD through the backstretch run,
responded when given his cue and went on an outside attack near the five sixteenths, wrested a short lead entering the lane, went clear under a drive
leaving the three sixteenths, wandered outward a bit late but held firm while kept alert. VANCE SCHOLARS saved ground and was put to coaxing into the
far turn, eased out soon after, gave hard chase four wide into the lane, made a grinding run through the final furlong and was along for the place through the
final yards. AIN'T DA BEER COLD cleared off early, set the pace towards the inner rail, met the winner's bid after six furlongs, battled to upper stretch, gave
way grudgingly in the final furlong and lost the place late. MAGIC MICHAEL , towards the inside early on, was under pressure leaving the far turn, eased out
but lacked a solid finish. BOSS LOGIC , under rating three deep into the backstretch, remained off the rail while chasing past the half, failed to kick on under
a hearty ride leaving the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
STELLAR LUTE , kept outside horses around the first turn, remained wide the far turn, moved to the five path in upper stretch, closed determinedly and was
up at the wire. DR. HYDE , unhurried down the backstretch, advanced four deep on the far turn, gained the lead inside the eighth pole and gave way
grudgingly. AWESOME STRIKE , steadied when bearing in and bumping DYNA MAST at the break, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied.
DYNA MAST bumped SIGMUND when bumped and forced in by AWESOME STRIKE leaving the starting gate, worked between horses in the stretch and
finished willingly. WIRED IN chased the pace, circled the far turn three wide, gained a short lead in mid stretch and tired. MIKE THE BOMB bore in leaving
the starting gate, sped to the early lead, opened up on the backstretch and tired the final furlong. CARLOUN (IRE) stayed along the inner rail on the far turn
and failed to rally. INSPIRED IRISH , steadied to avoid geese leaving the first turn, chased the pace and weakened between rivals. DANCING MISCHIEF
raced between horses throughout and gave way in the drive. SIGMUND , bumped leaving the starting gate, remained along the inner rail and gave way.
LIGHTNING LAD , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was outrun. The field had to negotiate a flock of geese leaving the first turn.
