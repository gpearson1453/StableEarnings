Footnotes
CONQUERING CAT chased in the three path, gained place entering the lane, sustained progress to reel in the clear leader in the final sixteenth, flopped
back to his left lead and held from a late outer bidder. MUNSON broke slowly, lacked speed in the three path, shifted out six wide nearing midstretch and
offered a belated kick to take aim on the new leader approaching the wire, but ran out of ground. THE TONER dueled for the lead with an outer rival into the
turn, drew clear of that one leaving the five sixteenths pole, came under a drive with three sixteenths to go, but was caught in the final sixteenth, yielded and
saved show. MAGNITUDE chased from midpack in the four path, got floated five wide entering the lane, stayed on with a mild kick while flopping back to his
left lead at the sixteenth pole, got outkicked for minor placings by a late rallying rival and narrowly reached fourth at the wire. SING SING pursued from off of
the pace in the two path, advanced splitting rivals four wide entering the lane, but failed to offer a bid, kept on mildly and missed fourth. FIDDLING FELIX
broke slowly, trailed in the two path, improved inside of a rival in upper stretch, tipped two wide and ran on between horses. KEEP IT EASY tracked along
the inside, chased into the lane and faded. EL DANDI dueled for the lead two wide, gave way to his inner counterpart turning for home and faltered between
horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MARGOINABUBBLEBATH dueled for the lead with an outer rival around the turn, then drove clear at the furlong grounds. ROSE PALACE broke a step
slow, trailed along the inside into the turn, shifted off the rail around the bend, advanced in upper stretch, shifted out to the eight path while picking up stride
in the final furlong, then offered a late kick to reach place in the shadow of the wire. CENTER STAGE broke in a tangle, pursued from off of the pace in the
three path, shfited out five wide entering the lane, stayed on in the final furlong to bid for place along with an outer rival in the closing stages, but got
outkicked. MERCY WARREN dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner around the turn and through upper stretch, but yielded at the furlong
grounds and got surpassed by a pair of outer place-bidders late. ABITIBI stalked the top pair from the three path, chased them while getting brushed to the
four path by an inner rival in upper stretch, then kept on mildly between horses. FOREVER HOME stalked along the inside, brushed her way to the three
path while chasing the embattled leading pair in upper stretch, but lacked a bid and was put to hand behind a tiring foe late. GHOSTLY GAL laid off of the
pace in the two path and failed to factor. FOR THE BISCUIT broke a bit outwardly, tracked from the four path, chased into the turn and faded turning for
home. PER RULING #ECM2024-203 FROM HIWU, MARGOINABUBBLEBATH WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE
TEST.

FIRST PLAYER pressed outside of the leader whlie tugging in the four path around the first turn, sustained pressure in the three path approaching the far
turn, forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, inched clear entering the lane and held sway. MANDALORIAN stalked the top pair from the five to four
path, floated back to the five path entering the lane, stayed on to vie for place with an inner rival while chasing the leader in the final furlong and prevailed for
place. HIGGINSVILLE raced forwardly in the two path before tracking along the inside leaving the first turn, shifted out to the three path in pursuit entering
the lane, stayed on to vie for place with an outer rival in the final furlong, but missed. MO RUM showed the way inside of a prompting foe while in the three
to two path, got headed by that one at the five sixteenths pole, kept on in pursuit through midstretch but yielded late. SPEED INSTITUTE settled off of the
pace in the three to two path, shifted out to the five path with three furlongs to go, drifted to the seven path entering upper stretch and lacked a bid.
PANCAKE HOUSE tracked along the inside into the first turn, before checking back at the seven furlong pole, moved two wide and between horses into the
backstretch, chased among foes around the far turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane and yielded between horses. GOTTA HAVE DREAMS lacked
speed in the three path, then the four to five path around the far turn and failed to factor. MOUNT CRAIG got keen between horses and checked back early
on, laid off of the pace along the inside, pursued from the two path around the far turn, shfited to the four path entering the lane, but lacked a bid and tired
late. CHARNICO broke a beat slow before being subtly put to tight quarters by an outer rival early on, trailed in the two path and failed to factor. FEAR OF
UNION pursued from midpack in the four to three path around the first turn, but faded while getting floated to the six path at the three furlong pole and was
done early.

Footnotes
SIMPLY IN FRONT tracked two to three wide, bid outside of the top pair and in the four path entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch and held sway.
KALISPERA (IRE) bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside while tugging in the bit into the first turn, pursued two wide
turning for home, shifted three wide and between horses to launch grinding progress in midstretch, and edged place late. BIG TROUBLE showed the way
along the inside, got headed while inside of a pair of rivals entering the lane, sustained a chase while clinging to place in the final furlong, but lost that
position in the final sixteenth and held show. TAKEMETOTHEBEACH pressed outside of the leader, bid turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer
challenger entering the lane, chased into midstretch and gradually yielded between horses. WEIGH THE RISKS pursued from midpack in the two path,
tracked shifting to the three path around teh far turn, got floated four wide in upper stretch, chased mildly and missed fourth. CHEYENNE MOON raced off
of the pace in the three path and failed to menace. PURLOIN broke a step slow, trailed along the inside, then in the three to two path around the far turn,
improved between horses entering the lane and failed to factor. SIERRA SKY bumped with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside and
made little impact. MODERN SOUND lacked speed in the two to three path and never got involved. MISCHIEVOUSNESS stalked along the inside and
faded around the far turn.

AMY Z stalked three deep, bid turning for home, vied between horses in upper stretch, forged a narrow advantage at the furlong grounds, flopped back to
her left lead while gamely sparring with her outer counterpart late and just held. MISS ENCHANTED tracked from midpack four wide, ranged up to bid
entering the lane, vied through the final furlong but narrowly missed. U AIN'T THAT LUCKY set a pressured pace along the inside, vied with a pair of
bidders in upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong grounds and yielded late. STARCOURT tracked behind the leaders and from teh two path, then
chased the leading trio home and lacked a bid. UP THE CREEK tugged behind rivals while pursuing from midpack along the inside, steadied leaving the
half mile pole, regained stride before tipping to the four path entering the lane and chased thereafter. LEAMETATRAINER broke slowly, saved ground well
back and improved position. DARK FURY bobbled behind and broke many lengths slow, trailed in the two path, shifted out to the seven path in upper
stretch and moved up. PLAGNE CHAMPAGNE raced off of the pace in the three path and failed to factor. SWAG SHOP chased from midpack in the three
path, shfited to the five path entering the lane and faded. CLASSIC CLAIRE broke a touch outwardly, prompted outside of the leader, then between horses
turning for home and caved among foes in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SPEED BIAS steadied in tight rail quarters early on, stalked under snug restraint along the inside around the first turn, was roused to the three path pursuing
around the far turn, ranged up to bid in upper stretch, drove past the leading pair at the furlong grounds, dug in to brace for an outer late challenge and held.
GUNTOWN pursued from midpack in the three path and between horses, chased in the two path around the far turn, smoothly tipped outside of the leading
trio in upper stretch, sustained grinding progress while flopping back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole, bid outside of the leader in the late stages but was
denied. HURRY HURRY broke a step slow and brushed with an inner rival at the start, raced at the rear two wide and between horses, then in the four path
around the far turn, gained between horses entering the lane and rallied to reach show late. NYQUICK came in soon after the start, set the pace along the
inside as an outer rival applied pressure, vied with that one around the far turn, got headed while taking light contact from his counterpart entering the lane
and again in upper stretch, then yielded to outer foes through the final furlong. PHILEAS FOGG bobbled slightly a stride after leaving the gate, then checked
to alter outside of an inwardly-shifting rival early on, prompted two wide, vied around the far turn, forged an advantage while brushing his inner counterpart
entering the lane and again in upper stretch, led until being headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and faded. BANISHING bumped with an inner
rival at the start, stalked three wide, chased in the four path around the far turn then weakened after drifting to the six path entering the lane. PROVE
WORTHY saved ground towards the rear, swung out to the eight path leaving the three sixteenths pole and failed to factor. COMMANDPERFORMANCE
broke a beat slow and brushed with an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the two path, chased further back in the three path around the far
turn and was no factor. THE PRINCE'S SPUR bumped with an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack four wide, then in the five path around teh far
turn before getting floated to the seven path entering the lane, and weakened. KING ICE trailed three wide, then in the five path around the far turn and got

JOHNY'S FIREBALL stalked outside of the pace setter, ranged up entering the lane, chased before forging an advantage at the furlong grounds, edged
ahead and held late. CASH EQUITY (FR) trailed along the inside, then in the three path around the far turn before fanning to the six path entering the lane,
rallied with a good kick to attempt a bid nearing the wire, but just came up short. TUT'S REVENGE set the pace along the inside, shook away from an outer
bidder straightening for home, but was collared by that one at the furlong pole, yielded late and held show. CAMP HOPE tracked two to three wide, floated
to the four path entering the lane, sustained pursuit in the final furlong, got outkicked by an outer rival late and missed show. HIDDEN STASH tracked along
the inside, chased around the far turn, entered the lane in the three path and lacked a bid. BAY STREET MONEY pursued from midpack in the three path
and lacked a bid. FUERTEVENTURA was brushed between horses at the start, settled off of the pace in the three to two path and between horses around
the far turn, shifted to the four path into upper stretch and failed to menace. BIG BLUE LINE saved ground well back to no avail. POINT PROVEN laid off of
the pace in the four to three path, floated back to the five path into upper stretch, then yielded from tight quarters between foes. BARBERINI pursued from
mipack in the two path and faded between horses.

ATTACHE prompted three wide, led into the lane and drove clear in the final furlong. TIVY bumped with an outer rival at the start, vied two wide and
between horses, got headed by his outer counterpart entering the lane, yielded to that one with a sixteenth to go and held place. MASTER OF ARMS broke
slowly, stalked along the inside, tipped to the two path at the three furlong pole, shifted outside of the leading trio in upper stretch, ran on to bid for place late
but was denied. JUNIOR BUG laid off of the pace along the inside, improved entering the lane, kept on to attempt a bid for show but needed more. FAN
THE FIRE tracked two wide and between horses, chased in the three to four path turning for home and failed to menace. CATHEDRAL BEACH broke out,
pursued from midpack three wide and between horses, yielded at the three furlong pole, tucked to the two path entering upper stretch and moved up
between horses in the final furlong. GLOBAL STAGE bumped with an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace five wide, inched closer turning for home
but tired in upper stretch. SAINT IN THE CITY was floated out by an inner rival at the start, stalked four wide, but faded between horses nearing the lane.
COLD AS HELL led narrowly while vying with an outer pair of rivals into the turn, but faded in upper stretch. TIGER'S LEGACY trailed in the four to five path
before swinging to the seven path entering upper stretch, and made little impact.
