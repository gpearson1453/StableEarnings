steady handling. FOREVER SAFE was clear early and couldn't hold off the winner. ETNA'S NAPPER bid in the three path at the three-eighths pole and
gained the show late. ALL ABOUT ALICE stalked the pace inside, moved to the three path in the stretch and had no late bid. NACHTHEXEN stalked in the

PASSING JUDGMENT stalked the pace in the three path, went to the rail at the quarter pole, rallied and was in time under a mild drive.
GEWURZTRAMINER led inside and was caught late. PROFESSOR HIGGINS stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the three-eighths pole and gained
the show late. HEEDING was unrushed early, angled to the five path at the three-eighths pole and rallied belatedly. FRANK JR pressed the pace in the
three path and yielded in the stretch. TIGER PAW (IRE) pressed the pace in the four path and lacked a late bid. LOOKING GOOD LEWIS pressed the pace
outside of the leader and gave way at the eighth pole. MAASAI WARRIOR took back early, saved ground and had no late bid. LEGAL TITAN saved ground
and faded in the stretch. DO YA WANNA DANCE was not a factor. DEEP STRIKE stalked the early pace between rivals and gave way near the half-mile
pole.
