COOKN WIT CATMAN broke out and bumped with DROMAS leaving the gate, then rushed up to take an unchallenged lead throughout and was kept to
task in the drive. SILVER TONE was allowed to settle while racing three to four wide down the backstretch then launched a three wide bid at the three
furlong marker but couldn't catch the leader and was clearly second best. RUNNIN MUNNIN raced off the pace from between horses to midway through the
final turn but lacked the late response but was best of the rest. DROMAS bumped with COOKN WIT CATMAN leaving the starting gate then settled off the
pace on the inside to the middle of the final turn and weakened. SAM'S PROMISE raced near the back down the backstretch then made a bid between
horses at the half mile marker but was shuffled back going into the final turn and remained back. DEN'S GOOD GRACE stalked the pace from three wide to
the half mile marker and dropped back.

Footnotes
HUMOR ME PLEASE went five wide into the first turn then steadily advanced from four wide around the final turn and engaged the leader at the eighth pole,
fought gamely in the stretch to edge clear late. LITTLE WARRIOR tracked the leaders while saving ground through the final turn then angled out to three
wide at the quarter pole to engage the leader at the eighth pole and fought gamely to the wire but was outkicked late. CLASSIC RUNNER stalked the pace
from off the rail down the backstretch, made a three wide bid at the three furlong marker to engage the leader at the five sixteenths pole and matched
strides outside of CHROME RUN to the top of the stretch but gave way grudgingly. ROYAL DE BE raced near the back through the final turn and made a
late rally to pass tiring rivals. CHROME RUN prompted the pace from the two path, made a bid at the three furlong marker to engage the leader at the five
sixteenths pole and matched strides on the inside of CLASSIC RUNNER to the top of the stretch and weakened. DABOOGEYMAN failed to menace. COOL
RIDE was hustled along to take the clear lead down the backstretch was headed at the five sixteenths and gave way.

STEAL ME OVER raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved up going four wide at the quarter pole and drove past the leaders while
dueling outside of rivals and won the not. PAYTON'S INDIAN chased the leader around the turn on the rail then angled out to three wide at the quarter pole
and battled down the stretch but lost the photo. BEULAH K was last away and moved up from two wide around the turn, angled out to three wide at the
sixteenths pole for the late gain to be up for show. SHE BADGER prompted the pace from three wide on the backstretch then moved up to duel with the
leader around the turn but was eclipsed at the eighth pole by outside rivals and was outfinished. OAK HILL SENIORITA raced near the back down the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and passed tiring rivals. SPARKLE CITY raced off the early pace from the two path then fell back on the turn and
was not a factor. TENSAS CLEAR rushed to the early lead then dueled inside of rival on the turn and tired in early stretch.

MILLIE'S DESTINY was roused to the lead but was challenged midway through the turn but fended off the rival and drew clear in the stretch. SAINT
ISABEL hustled away from the gate to pressed the pace from the two path, engaged the leader midway through the turn but couldn't overtake and was
second best. LA CANTAROS tracked the leader from the inside through the turn then gave a late kick to be up for the show. SCAMPERING MA'AM was
forwardly placed from four wide, made a mild bid on the turn but faltered. CAT ATE THE CANARY raced in the middle of the pack on the turn, made a four
wide bid at the quarter pole but failed to menace. SMOKIN MOTION raced near the back and was not a threat. FREE WILL raced off the pace from two
wide to the middle of the turn and retreated. LA LOMBRIZ raced in the middle of the pack on the inside and had no impact. FABULOUS TALE showed no
speed and was not a factor.

final turn, took command at the top of the stretch and drew off. CRYSTAL CRESCENT pinched at the start then settled back while saving ground down the
backstretch then moved up from two wide on the final turn, tipped out to three wide in upper stretch, moving out to four wide at the eighth pole for the rally.
HURRICANE TIZWAY rushed away to presse the pace from two wide down the backstretch then engaged the leader midway through the final turn and took
a brief lead before being eclipsed at the top of the stretch and weakened. QUINN ELLA raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail down the backstretch
then moved out to four wide on the turn but was shuffled back nearing the quarter pole but made a late run to improve position. MIDNIGHT TRIP was
allowed to settle down the backstretch then moved out to four wide going into the final turn but couldn't gain on the leaders and passed tired ones in the
stretch. CALAJA husted to the lead to set most of the pace from the inside but was headed midway through the final turn and fought gamely into the stretch
but tired. FOLLOW THE SAINT stalked the pace from three wide to the quarter pole and gave way.
