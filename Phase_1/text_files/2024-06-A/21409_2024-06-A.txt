Footnotes
BLUEBERRY FIELDS settled smartly alone behind the top two on the first turn, comfortably kept tabs on the engaged pair down the backside, reeled in the
leader easily around the final bend, cruised to the lead by upper stretch and drew away when roused at the furlong marker for the impressive score.
STREGA tracked the pacesetter into the first turn, hounded the frontrunner outside down the back straight, assumed command with three eighths
remaining, had little to offer when the eventual winner collared her at the top of the stretch and stayed on stubbornly to just hold for second money. HAY
HAY PAULA was unhurried to co-trail on the inside in the beginning, advanced on the fence by the half, made a sharp move progressing on the rail with five
sixteenths to go, angled four wide straightening out for home and closed in but just missed getting up for the place share at the wire. COZY CURLIN
KITTEN stalked outside in the first turn, continued that position down the backside, made a good move, rallying four wide around rivals at the three furlong
pole, posed a threat for a share at the top of the lane outside but finished up evenly for a minor placing in the end. MI CORAZON stalked on the fence in the
early going, improved position on the back straight, was checked mildly when coming up to the troubled rival at the three eighths marker, lost her
momentum and failed to menace in the running down the lane. SPUTNIK co-trailed on the outside in the first turn, was uninterested on the rail down the
backside, closed the gap on the leaders saving ground on the final bend but could not get involved running on the fence through the stretch drive.
PRINCESS MAYFAIR took command getting to the rail unchallenged into the first turn, maintained a slim lead while hounded outside setting a soft pace,
lost the lead three furlongs out, was roused, had no response, stopped abruptly midway on the far turn, was eased crossing the finish line and walked off.

Footnotes
SERENADING HALL was allowed to settle co-trailing on the outside down the backstretch, began to lengthen stride midway on the far turn at the five
sixteenths marker, swung out widest in the five path at the top of the lane, was full of run having a clear path and got up just at the wire for a well timed late
rally. MAKAYLA was floated out four wide on the first turn, had a couple of runners beaten travelling down the backside, made little impression on the final
bend but had a strong stretch kick in the final furlong on the fence to just miss at the finish. SARAH'S DANCER was nestled on the rail behind the leader on
the first turn, rated kindly on the fence tracking in the second flight along the backside, shifted out to the three path to bid at the quarter pole, loomed three
wide turning for home, poked her head in front momentarily with a sixteenth to go but was caught by the closers nearing the wire and settled for the show
prize. KATHERINE'S GEM was fanned five wide on the first turn outside horses, tracked the contesting pair down the back straight, watched the duo four
wide keeping track of the leaders on the far turn and finished up willingly to garner a minor role at the finish. FEDALINE had the lead inside going into the
first turn, continued to set the pace while pressed outside down the backstretch, lost the lead at the quarter pole, re-rallied inside at the furlong marker to be
in front again and could not find more late and faded in deep stretch. P. S. RISING STAR travelled on the rail in mid-pack in the early stages, kept pace with
others on the far turn, finished up only mildly between many horses in the stretch drive but did lack clear running room in deep stretch. DIFFERENT DRUM
prompted the pace outside in the first turn, continued to shadow the leader down the backside, poked her head in front at the quarter pole to lead briefly,
was still in the mix dueling for the lead in the two path with rivals on each side at the furlong marker and weakened with a sixteenth left to run. FOREST
VIXEN travelled three wide between foes in the first turn, settled in mid-pack three deep down the backstretch, closed the gap going well at the quarter pole
but failed to fire in the four path down the lane. TAKE CHANCES settled near the rear on the rail in the beginning, co-trailed inside along the back straight,
made no impact running on the final turn and could not be a factor in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MY GIRL DELLA took control on the rail from the start, set a slow pace in the first quarter, was comfortably setting the fractions down the backside while
unopposed, improved the margin up front throughout the final turn, kept to the task and coasted home unchallenged at the wire. SACCHARINE had a rail
trip in the third flight down the backside, smartly started to go by runners saving all the ground in the final oval and finished up strongly on the fence to best
the rest crossing the finish line. ROIKOP missed the break a touch on the start to trail in the beginning, began to pick up runners three wide going around
rivals on the far turn and had a good late rally outside to be a clear third. CATCH THE DRIFT was content to track outside in the early stages of the race,
chased the loose leader on the final bend, could not close the gap and faded in the final sixteenth losing placings. SHAKSHUKA watched the leader sitting
on the rail in the first turn, tracked inside in the second flight at the half, was ridden for more clinging to third money midway on the far turn, could not find
more straightening for home and stalled in mid-stretch. BEAUTIFUL SKY was situated between runners in the two path going into the first bend, stalked in
the third flight outside horses down the backside, was urged for more at the three furlong pole but had little to give and failed to menace in the drive to the
wire. BLAME THE GELATO travelled three wide into the first turn, settled on the outside in the second flight down the backstretch, was asked to quicken
three eighths out, offered little response and backed away through the final turn.

Footnotes
LIAM'S GIFT tracked in behind the pacesetter heading into and on the turn, tipped out a bit in upper stretch with aim on the leader, took over nearing the
furlong grounds, held foes at bay. CREED'S GOLD got away well then settled into stride stalking the leaders in behind racing between foes into the turn,
came out about six wide in upper stretch, loomed a major threat by mid-stretch, lugged in near the sixteenth pole and couldn't reach the winner while just
saving the place. MISS ROBERTS (GB) got away slowly, angled in and moved rapidly inside while keen, was taken a sharp hold of after about the opening
furlong to avoid running up on heels, tracked from inside the second group into the turn, sought room in upper stretch, was guided out seven deep in
mid-stretch, finished up willingly. CRY FREEDOM was well-placed outside the second flight stalking four wide through the turn, took closer order coming to
the top of the stretch then went evenly thereafter. OUR FLAG FLYING bumped with a foe at the start, settled at the rear outside, swung seven wide turning
for home, showed good late effort. SHARP FLAME settled outside at the back, travelled mostly three to five wide, went one-paced but improved position.
VOICE FROM ABOVE broke just a bit awkwardly and outwardly, raced off the pace inside a rival but off the fence, came into upper stretch four deep then
angled nearer the rail, ran on but needed more. PROMISING settled mid-pack racing in the clear, went four to six wide throughout, raced evenly and made
no bid. THE NIIGON FACTOR quickly moved clear, set the pace from inside, came up empty in the final furlong. EMERANCE exchanged some bumps at
the start, was well-placed stalking outside a rival three deep, edged closer looming a threat past the five-sixteenths but flattened out in the stretch.
BROADWAY FORCE bumped a rival at the start, raced inside foes in the back half of the field through the turn, failed to rally. LADY XI lacked early speed,
shifted in, saved some ground while bringing up the rear but was never a threat.

Footnotes
FLAG OF HONOUR (AUS) pressed the early pace inside then took over the lead forcing the issue at the four- and one-half, raced inside on or just off the
rail, was put to a drive in upper stretch, held sway under steady handling. OLD CHESTNUT switched outside a rival while in behind in the early going
settling in the back half of the field, went two then three wide on the turn, was guided out five deep in the stretch for room, finished well to gain the place.
IRONSTONE unhurriedly brought up the rear, swung eight wide turning for home, was gaining solidly but too little too late. STEP FORWARD got away well,
set the early tempo from outside for three-sixteenths then continued to press and chase the winner from outside three wide, lacked the needed late kick.
CANDY OVERLOAD settled off the inside part of the course, swung six to seven wide into upper stretch, ran evenly and needed more. MASON'S GAMBLE
was taken back off the leading pair, tracked from inside saving ground on the turn and in close, flattened out. WAR BOMBER (IRE) stalked from outside
mid-pack, failed to rally.

Footnotes
CRUDEN BAY tossed his head on the break, was unhurried close to the rear three deep outside rivals on the backside, started to reach for more ground
two wide outside foes at the three furlong pole, angled out in the seven path turning for home, was asked for more left handed in upper stretch and finished
the strongest in the final eighth to be opening up at the wire. SKY'S NOT FALLING was squeezed on the start, rated kindly all alone in the middle of the
pack down the backside, began to close in at the quarter pole, angled out for the drive six wide at the top of the lane and rallied smartly in the stretch but
was no match for the winner who had an over powering late kick. BORDER TOWN tracked the duo on the rail down the backstretch, continued to do the
same throughout the turn, swung out to the three path by the quarter pole, under a drive shifted in, to the rail by the furlong marker and won the secondary
battle for the show award in a photo. SECRET RESERVE was eager on the outside prompting the pace on the backstretch, forced a lively second quarter
going around the bend, poked his head in front by upper stretch in the three path, was no match for the closing top two at the eighth pole and stubbornly lost
the duel for show in the end. SANTORINI was under a good hold alone four wide on the outside in the back straight, travelled comfortably by himself in the
third flight around the turn, was in the hunt five wide straightening out for home but was out finished between runners in the final furlong. CLEAR
DESTINATION broke out on the start, settled two wide between runners close to the back in the beginning, made little progress on the turn, shifted out
widest in lane eight for the drive and finished up with some good late energy in deep stretch. ROARING FORTIES tracked the front pair three wide on the
outside through the turn, loomed in the four path at the top of the stretch, could not accelerate with rivals in mid-stretch and lacked a finishing kick in the final
furlong. LUCKMAN had no early speed as usual and trailed down the backside, continued to see the pack around the oval, angled out to the seven path and
passed tired runners in the late stages. OLYMPIC RUNNER stalked on the rail near the rear in the early going, made no headway saving ground going
around the turn and had nothing to give on the fence driving to the wire. STITCHED tracked the top two between foes down the backstretch, travelled in the
second flight with horses on each side around the bend, was battling in the mix just behind the leaders in the four path straightening out for home, could not
go on and folded between horses with an eighth remaining. THERE'S NO JOE took this field down the backside, was pressed outside throughout the turn,
was collared outside with five sixteenths from the prize, could not find more in the stretch and was engulfed by runners on both sides by the furlong marker.

Footnotes
FASHIONABLY FAB tracked the pace early on, had an ideal set up when patiently handled, taking back to watch the engaged duo to track all alone down
the backside, began to inch closer with five sixteenths remaining, burst between the contesting pair up front at the quarter pole and dueled to the wire with a
stubborn frontrunner but won the battle edging away in deep stretch. SOLO ALBUM showed this field into the first turn, dictated the pace along the backside
while shadowed on the outside by a rival, braced for the challenge outside by the eventual winner in upper stretch, fought on gamely to the eighth pole and
gave way grudgingly in the final sixteenth. FOREVER DIXIE hopped at the start, trailing early, angled outside the field in the four path for clear running room
along the backside, started to go past runners three furlongs from the wire and closed in four wide down the stretch to get up just before the wire to nail the
show award. METAPHYSICAL tracked three wide going to the first bend, closed in to prompt the pace outside down the back straight, started to give way to
the top pair three wide at the quarter pole, ran on the wrong lead down the stretch and was just caught at the wire for third money. MILLIE GIRL settled four
wide on the outside of horses in the first turn, travelled in the three path clear on the outside down the backstretch, was asked right handed midway on the
final bend, offered little kick and was one paced driving to the finish line. SARATOGA VISION travelled on the rail close to the back of the pack into the first
of two turns, was relegated to the rear by the half, could not keep up with the field by the three furlong pole, shifted outside to the five path for the stretch run
but could not make a presence down the lane. BIG BRASS BED settled in the three path near the back between rivals on the first turn, continued that
position along the backside, was asked through the turn, could not close the gap and made little movement in the stretch running. INDY CHAMPAGNE was
in a stalking position near the back in the two path with runners on both sides going into the first turn, improved her position on the fence by the half, offered
a mild run at the three furlong marker, could not go on at the top of the lane and stopped on the fence through the stretch drive.

PLAY THE MUSIC settled inside the second flight tracking the leading pair, saved ground on the turn, came out a bit for the drive, found plenty of room
inside the leader to bid nearing the furlong grounds, took command and drove clear. SECRET MONEY stalked from between runners in the second flight,
angled eight wide at the top of the stretch, kicked on well late to get up for place. MISS SPEEDY quickly moved clear, set the pace from off the rail in the
three path, drifted out a bit turning for home, was overtaken a furlong out and outkicked. DOLCE SOPRESA was unhurried early racing near the rail, came
out six wide in upper stretch, passed between foes then shifted back in a bit late, kept on evenly. STAR CANDY stalked from outside four to six wide on the
turn, took closer order late on that bend looming a threat in upper stretch while coming out a bit further, evened out in the lane. BABY NO WORRIES was in
a bit tight at the start, lacked early speed bringing up the rear, swung ten wide turning into upper stretch, kicked on with mild late interest but needed more.
BLIND SPOT raced between foes a bit in the early going off the leaders in the back half of the field, shifted seven wide turning for home, checked at the
quarter pole, ran on evenly late. AWESOME TREAT raced outside runners back of the leaders, was in the third flight into the turn racing four to six deep,
swung nine wide for the drive, was near striking distance but lacked the needed late kick. PEACOCK LASS settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn
but failed to menace. HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES broke outwardly, pressed the pace from outside, went four wide on the turn, drifted six deep turning into
upper stretch then back in a bit, faltered and faded. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF BLIND SPOT AGAINST SECRET MONEY
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED SEVENTH BEHIND THE
FORMER.

Footnotes
PALAZZI was bumped inwards at the start, unhurriedly brought up the rear racing off the inside, began to advance swiftly outside foes from the
five-sixteenths, fanned seven wide turning for home, ground on steadily then surged past inside the final seventy yards while also lugging out despite
right-handed encouragement. TYSON rated off the leaders in behind and inside early, saved ground on both turns, was encouraged a bit nearing the
three-eighths then put to a drive in earnest past the quarter pole, angled four wide at the top of the stretch then was guided out a further path, bid between
foes inside the sixteenth pole but was only second best. PARAMOUNT PRINCE bumped a rival at the start, was well-positioned just off and outside the
pacesetter stalking three deep, made a mild bid taking a narrow and brief lead at the sixteenth pole but was outfinished. GET SMOKIN quickly moved clear
under some encouragement, set the pace from off the rail, was challenged in the stretch and outkicked late. J P HELLISH was bumped into a rival at the
start, shifted in tracking just off the leading pair saving ground near the rail, was within striking distance into the stretch but only went evenly late. SKYRO
was forced in a bit and in tight at the start, settled last but one, swung six wide leaving the far turn, was bumped at the top of the stretch, needed more late.
RONDURE stalked from outside about mid-pack, fanned out leaving the far turn, was in tight and forced out bumping a rival at the top of the stretch, failed to
rally.

Footnotes
MONT SAINT MICHEL (FR) was in the mix up front between horses at the start, settled down to track the top two down the backstretch, rated kindly on the
turn in the third flight outside rivals, moved in to bid five wide turning for home, took control by the furlong pole and had enough in deep stretch to hold safe.
VAZHI settled in between rivals in mid-field, rallied on the rail three furlongs from home, had a quick turn of foot while shifting outside in the nine path having
a clear run down the stretch, was closing in late with every stride but could not get there in time. ROMANTICA settled in mid-division with runners on either
side down the backstretch, continued that trip through the turn, made a sharp move six wide at the quarter pole to bid for the lead, fought gamely in the
stretch but was outdueled between runners nearing the wire and settled for show with a solid debut effort. ENCOURAGEACHOTHER had a rail trip just
behind the pacesetter down the backstretch, continued to bide her time watching the frontrunner who was having problems negotiating the turn, shifted
outside three wide at the top of the stretch to bid for the lead, fought until the eighth pole and faded some to settle on the fringes in the end. DETERMINED
FIRST broke outwards on the start, tracked the leaders under restraint four deep along the backside, was shuffled back multiple positions entering the turn,
weaved through traffic in the seven path in upper stretch and finished up outside with good late energy. NANTUCKETS DAY was brushed at the start,
stalked between foes near the back in the early going, made little headway on the turn, closed the gap on the leaders in the five path at the quarter pole and
ran on willingly in the final furling. QUALITY PRESENCE was under a snug hold just behind the tracking trio down the backstretch, kept pace sitting on the
fence around the oval, was looking for running room behind the leaders at the top of the stretch, could not move with others at the furlong pole and finished
up evenly in the late stages. ANTIHERO ran outside horses near the rear in the backstretch, made little improvement outside horses on the bend, shifted
inwards to the three path at the top of the lane, ran greenly down the lane and could not get involved at the finish line. WORSHIP pressed the pace inside at
the beginning, took over the lead running headstrong on the rail at the five eighths marker, tried to get out while setting the pace, rider did a good job nursing
the horse on the lead keeping a fairly straight path around the turn, was clinging onto the lead in the two path in upper stretch, retreated in the final furlong
and was steadied, drifting in while tiring in deep stretch. STORMS OF LIFE had on rival beaten down the backside, made little progression outside foes
through the turn, angled out widest in the nine path straightening out for home and could not get into contention running down the lane. ALL FOR HONOR
settled near the rear between foes down the backstretch, improved smartly on the fence running around the turn to be in range at the top of the lane, was
one paced in the stretch and had to be checked at the sixteenth pole coming up on a weary rival that was drifting. HELIOCENTRIC was unhurried at the
start to trail along the backstretch, could not get interested inside through the bend and passed tired runners in the stretch drive. TWIRLING PIPER was
pushed out on the break, recovered to vie for the lead early on, pressed the pace outside at the five eighths marker, chased the frontrunner outside
throughout the turn, battled for the lead briefly in the four path at the quarter pole and wilted between horses by mid-stretch. CODED ENTRY broke in at the
start, was going well in hand settling outside in mid-pack along the backside, travelled three wide outside foes keeping up with rivals around the turn, was
fanned out to the eight path at the top of the lane and had no finish to offer in the stretch run.
