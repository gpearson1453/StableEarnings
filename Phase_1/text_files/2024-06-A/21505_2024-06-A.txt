Footnotes
MS GLORIA JEAN was reserved off the early pace, moved up strongly nearing the quarter pole while four-wide, took the lead entering the stretch and won
drawing clear. SERIOUS MOMENT was close-up early racing along the inside, angled out two-wide nearing the quarter pole to split rivals offering her bid
but was unable to stay with the winner late. CHOCOLATTI was allowed to settle while racing two-wide, steadied momentarily while in tight nearing the
quarter pole, angled to come five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. SMOKIN SISTER prompted MONTANA ROSE while racing three-wide,
gained a slight lead nearing the quarter pole and then weakened during the drive. MONTANA ROSE saved ground setting the pace to near the quarter pole
and tired. ROCK IT RUBY was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and was not a serious threat. THE JOCKEY OF CHOCOLATTI LODGED AN
OBJECTION AGAINST SERIOUS MOMENT BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
MARIO'S ON POINT saved ground while racing in the middle of the field, slipped through nearing the stretch and finished fast to be up in the final seventy
yards. RUM TUM TUGGER saved ground setting the early pace, responded when headed while drifting out slightly leaving the quarter pole and held on
gamely for the place. GO TAKE CHARGE was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, angled out to be five-wide entering the stretch while offer his bid
but wasn't quite good enough in a steady effort. EXTRA MONEY stalked RUM TUM TUGGER while two-wide, moved up to take the lead nearing the half
mile pole, opened a clear lead entering the stretch then weakened late and was vanned off following the race. ICANDOTHAT was prominent early while
saving ground, came three-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. BALI RIDDIM was allowed to settle while racing two-wide, came four-wide into the
stretch but lacked a rally. FINAL OPPORTUNITY was forwardly placed early while three-wide and tired. DELETED VIDEO was reluctant to load then broke
out and was unhurried, came three-wide into the stretch and was not a threat. BIG ANDY MORT dropped back early while racing two-wide and failed to
menace. POOR AND POLITE saved ground throughout and gave way.

A PRIMERA VISTA set a modest tempo around the first turn, controlled the lead into the far bend, felt pressure nearing the furlong marker, and fought on
valiantly inside rival through the wire. ONE SILK STOCKING tracked the pace into the far turn, bid three wide entering the stretch, gained ground on the
leader to the furlong marker, loomed a threat but hung in the final yards. KATIES A LADY stalked the pace from the two path, called on leaving the quarter
pole, was out kicked to the wire. LADY ARSINOE raced well off the early pace, bid nearing the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch, lugged in and
flattened out late. SAL'S BLUE JACKET tracked from just off the pace down the backside, saved ground around the far turn, checked hard nearing the
quarter pole, and finished evenly through the stretch. SPIKED ground saving trip, never a threat.
