Footnotes
HERECOMEGEORGIEBOY allowed to settle leaving the start, tracked three wide into the first turn, well placed while widest through the backstretch run,
loomed three wide nearing the quarter marker, took command nearing the furlong and drew clear in the final stages. REEF CITY settled just off of the early
pace, tracked two wide and between runners into the first turn, maintained a tracking position between rivals through the backstretch run, gained ground into
the second turn, angled four wide for the drive, could not impact the winner in the final sixteenth and ran on to be second best. CANTILEVER unhurried in
the early running, was content to trail heading to the half-mile marker, was taken outside of rivals into the far turn and chased three to four wide nearing the
quarter pole, swung five to six wide for the drive, needed more into the final sixteenth and won the nod for third. BEAU BRUME was hustled away from the
start and assumed early command, set a contested pace along the first turn, carved out moderate fractions while prompted to the half-mile marker, battled
with IT'SANYBODYSGAME into the far turn, was overtaken by HERECOMEGEORGIEBOY into upper stretch, chased the winner to the furlong marker and
weakened in the final stages. FLYING OZZI forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the moderate pace from the inside, was well placed at the
half-mile pole and saved all of the ground into the second turn, raced a bit in tight nearing the quarter marker, could not muster a response into the stretch
drive and gave way. IT'SANYBODYSGAME prominent away from the start, contested the early pace two to three wide along the first turn, prompted the
moderate pace outside of BEAU BRUME through the backstretch run, vied for the lead into the second turn, could not keep pace into the lane, dropped
back in upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
CATCHME AT THELAKE hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set the pace heading to the half-mile marker, quickened into the turn
and set a pressured pace approaching the quarter pole, battled GOOD FOCUS into the stretch and held foes at bay into the final sixteenth, dug in in the late
stages and lasted at the finish for a determined win. GOOD FOCUS broke alertly, ceded the early lead to CATCHME AT THELAKE and tracked the pace
from the outside heading to the half-mile pole, advanced into the turn and disputed the pace three to four wide approaching the quarter marker, battled
CATCHME AT THELAKE into the stretch, dueled that foe into the final sixteenth, could not get by the determined winner in deep stretch and held for a share
of second at the finish. GOTCHA LOOKIN lost his path at the start and was off slowly, recovered and tracked the moderate early pace from the outside,
advanced into the turn and was guided four to five wide nearing the quarter pole, raced widest into the stretch, responded to firm urging and rallied into the
final sixteenth, could not catch the winner in deep stretch and got up in time to dead heat for the place honors. CARDINAL TRICK initially took back off of
the early pace then engaged with CATCHME AT THELAKE and chased that rival through moderate fractions heading to the half-mile marker, ran in pursuit
two wide and between runners entering the turn, stalked the pace to the quarter pole and chased into upper stretch, battled into the final sixteenth, was
outfinished in deep stretch and just missed for the minor awards. COUNT ASHER tracked the moderate pace from the inside, encountered traffic into the
turn and was boxed in at the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch, raced a bit in tight in deep stretch and closed willingly in the final
stages. THE FUSS prominent away from the start, took back off of the moderate early pace, tracked two to three wide nearing the quarter marker and
lacked a response in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
TIGER IN MY TANK pressed the pace set by GOOD LOVIN for the first half-mile in the three path, confidently ridden, bided time through the turn then
responded with a burst of speed when roused at the top of the stretch and was hand ridden to the wire. CLEVER CLOVER tracked close but three to four
wide down the backstretch, launched a bid from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into the stretch and finished well to gain second despite drifting a bit
down the lane. GOOD LOVIN broke well, assumed command about a furlong in while racing two paths off the rail, held sway through the far turn with the
rest in close pursuit, could not answer back when TIGER IN MY TANK challenged at the head of the stretch, weakened in the late stages and was
outfinished for second, while holding safely in the end for third. AUTISM PUZZLE was a bit slow to get into stride then was hustled up to the leaders, tracked
up close inside behind horses to the far turn, waited a bit for room then got a big hole to run through turning for home, came under heavy pressure but could
not sustain a bid and weakened in the final yards.

DISKO TRIBUTE broke alertly, ceded the early lead to IRISH CORN and stalked that runner through solid fractions heading to the half-mile marker, chased
two wide into the turn and was well placed nearing the quarter pole, drifted three wide into upper stretch and ran in pursuit of IRISH CORN approaching the
furlong marker, closed determinedly into the final sixteenth and wore down the runner-up in deep stretch to prevail. IRISH CORN hustled away from the
start, showed good speed and assumed early command, set solid fractions while clear nearing the half-mile marker, controlled the pace into the turn and
was well rated heading to the quarter pole, was set down into upper stretch and held a safe lead approaching the furlong marker, dug in while holding foes
at bay into the final sixteenth, could not hold off the determined winner in the final strides and held for second at the finish. DOO WOP DON tracked the solid
early pace from between rivals, chased into the turn and went two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, swung widest for the stretch drive and advanced at
the furlong marker, closed into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. TRINIDAD was unhurried
away from the start, trailed into the turn and was guided two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, responded to urging in the stretch drive and offered a
mild late rally. SATANTA rated off of the solid early pace, tracked from the inside heading to the half-mile marker and was well placed approaching the turn,
saved ground along the bend and chased to the quarter pole, maintained an inside position into the stretch and was outrun to the furlong marker, could not
muster a response in the late stages and finished evenly. GERLACH'S hopped at the start and was off a bit slowly, rushed up in the early stages and
tracked the solid pace heading to the half-mile marker, advanced three wide into the turn and chased the pace approaching the quarter pole, ran in pursuit
into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and tired.

Footnotes
DEBS TIZ rated nicely off of the solid early pace, was taken to the outside of the leading trio and tracked four wide approaching the turn, maintained that
four wide path into the turn and gained ground nearing the quarter marker, loomed into upper stretch and vied for the lead heading to the furlong marker,
took a narrow lead at mid-stretch and battled into the final sixteenth, shook free into deep stretch and drew clear late. RIGHT HAND RYDER hustled away
from the start, showed good speed and assumed command in the early going, set a solid pace heading to the half-mile marker, was engaged by GALLAND
DE BESOS entering the turn and dueled with that runner to the quarter marker while carving quick fractions, battled into the stretch, could not match strides
with DEBS TIZ into the final sixteenth and outfinished the rest to secure place honors. ALTRUIST was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the
solid early pace from the inside, was taken outside of the leading pair and stalked three deep approaching the turn, chased three wide along the bend and
gained ground nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked into the stretch, re-rallied into the final sixteenth and got up for third in the final strides. GALLAND DE
BESOS broke alertly and assumed early command away from the start, vied for the lead with RIGHT HAND RYDER then ceded the lead to that rival and
pressed from the outside heading to the half-mile marker, advanced into the turn and dueled RIGHT HAND RYDER through solid fractions heading to the
quarter pole, battled into the stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, weakened in the final sixteenth and just missed for third at the finish. MR.
FIGHTER took back off of the solid early pace, was a bit rank heading to the half-mile marker and tracked the pace from the outside approaching the turn,
improved position two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, angled out at the furlong marker and was able to offer a mild late
bid. ADIOS NICANOR lacked early speed leaving the start, trailed at the half-mile marker and was guided three to four wide into the turn, swung widest for
the stretch drive and did not factor in the late stages. CUT ACROSS SHORTY unhurried away from the start, made a steady advance along the rail heading
to the half-mile marker and tracked the solid pace approaching the turn, saved ground into the bend and lost position nearing the quarter pole, was outrun
into the stretch and did not threaten.

Footnotes
PRECIPICE settled behind SPARKLE SWEETLY while saving ground to the far turn, was always travelling well, tipped out to the two path for the stretch
run, powered past that rival at the head of the stretch despite racing on the wrong lead, straightened out at the furlong marker and sprinted away to an easy
win under a brisk hand ride. SPARKLE SWEETLY won the race to the first turn then took command when LEMON HAZE drifted out, carved out moderate
fractions to the far turn without taking much pressure from that foe, quickened into the last turn, held all at bay then had no response when PRECIPICE
made a challenge at the top of the stretch but kept on well to hold second. PIPPA PHILIPA took a light bump from LEMON HAZE then got forced into the
path of VALENTINE CRASHER, all started by THEA from the seven stall, got away from that tight spot and raced up close going into the clubhouse turn,
became boxed in and had to settle between horses through that first turn, remained inside through the far turn the looked to make a move to the outside
nearing the eighth pole, then shifted the inside, found best stride passing the chute and surged late to grab the third spot. LEMON HAZE was forced in at
the start to avoid contact with LEMON HAZE, then prompted to get early position and went into the first turn even with SPARKE SWEETLY on the lead,
drifted out a path taking FIREWORK out wide as well, then took up a stalking position ceding the pacesetting duties to SPARKLE SWEETLY and was
content with that position to the far turn, came under a ride from the quarter pole and could not keep up with top two down the stretch, finishing evenly and
losing the third spot in the final yards. THEA broke in a bit at the start causing a minor chain reaction to the inside, then settled in the second half of the pack
while racing three wide to the far turn, made a nice three wide bid through the far turn to get into contention then lugged out extremely wide out to the seven
or eight path, then lugged in when trying to correct, making light contact with FIREWORK at the top of the stretch, continued to run on when straightened,
and was gaining some near the end. SILVER FLIRT was taken in hand from the start then tried unsuccessfully to get over to the inside before the first turn,
floated three wide through that turn, then was last heading into the backstretch run, was put into a drive with three furlongs to run, came into the stretch with
every chance but could not summon the needed response. VALENTINE CRASHER took the worst of the action to the outside at the start and got shuffled
back, then became a bit rank through the first turn, was still a little hard to place in the run down the backstretch with the rider taking hold on two or three
occasions, was last going into the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch and drifted out even farther down the lane but finished well enough to pass a
couple late. OUR KENTUCKY ROSE raced in the rear half of the field while saving ground, made a mild bid on the far turn but did not quicken in the stretch,
finished one-paced, unable to improve. FIREWORK floated three to four wide on the first turn then tracked behind the pace while part of the forward group
to the far turn, went four wide into the stretch and tried to keep up but was outfinished.

Footnotes
IL BELLATOR broke sharply but was content to let ZEUS' WAR cut out the early fractions, was always traveling well racing in-hand two or three lengths
behind, cruised up to challenge from the quarter pole, responded on cue in upper stretch and drew clear under hand urging in the late stages. TESORO
raced up close three wide into the first turn and down the backstretch, advanced through the far turn to challenge for the lead, could not match strides with
the winner but finished willingly and just held off a fast closing PRINCE ABU DHABI to hold the place. PRINCE ABU DHABI stumbled coming out of the
gate, spotting the field a head start, recovered and settled at the rear through the first turn, moved to the outside for clear run as the field headed down the
backstretch, then shifted to the inside near the half-mile marker, bided time then was put into a drive approaching the three furlong pole, navigated a clear
path five wide into the stretch, put in a furious rally under steady handling and just missed the place. ZEUS' WAR easily gained the early lead and opened
up a clear advantage early, maintained the lead to the far turn while setting reasonable fractions with the rest taking closer order at that point, dug in when
challenged by IL BELLATOR at the quarter pole, fought to mid-stretch, gave way grudgingly and finished on good courage. LORD SHELDON tracked the
pace from mid-pack while saving ground, made an inside bid on the far turn, was still close turning into the stretch and loomed a mild threat but could not
make any impact late while finishing evenly. ROYAL 'N RANDO came away well but did not get involved in the early pace, settled well behind then had only
one beat down the backstretch, bid three to four wide through the far turn then came six wide into the stretch was kept to task and finished with some
interest but was not able to improve.

Footnotes
KAMAINA CRUISER was allowed to settle in the early stages, raced two wide along the first turn and was unhurried through the backstretch run, navigated
traffic into the far turn and gained ground three wide nearing the quarter marker, drifted out a bit into upper stretch and was set down for the drive, chased
GOODBYE KAI to mid-stretch and continued to advance at the furlong marker, sustained his rally into the final sixteenth, reeled in GOODBYE KAI in deep
stretch and edged away in the final strides to prevail. GOODBYE KAI hustled away from the start, came under a snug early hold and raced in tight quarters
along the first turn, checked at the six furlong pole and settled off of the decent pace entering the backstretch run, was well placed at the half-mile marker,
advanced into the second turn and waited for racing room at the quarter marker, split foes and mounted a two wide bid into the stretch, took command in
upper stretch and drew clear at the furlong marker, felt pressure from KAMAINA CRUISER into the final sixteenth, was overtaken by the winner in the final
strides and was well clear of the rest for second. GOODBYE DAL was pinched back at the start and away a bit slowly, unhurried in the early running and
saved ground into the first turn, content to trail heading to the half-mile marker, was steered to the outside entering the far turn and improved position six
wide approaching the quarter marker, clipped heels nearing the top of the stretch, recovered and stayed on into the lane, could not impact the top pair in
deep stretch and outfinished DELIAN LEAGUE to secure the show honors. DELIAN LEAGUE was forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the early pace
three to four wide into the first turn, raced close up to the decent pace heading into the backstretch run and stalked four wide and between rivals nearing the
half-mile, chased four wide into the far turn, was carried to the six path into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong and was outfinished for third in deep
stretch. FAR TO LONG forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the early pace two to three wide into the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run
and prompted the decent pace three deep nearing the half-mile marker, battled into the far turn and vied for the lead three wide approaching the quarter
pole, lost position into upper stretch, drifted out at the three-sixteenths and carried out DELIAN LEAGUE at that station, gave way past mid-stretch and
could not muster a late response. UNBRIDLED RHYTHM raced close up to the decent early pace and went five wide into the clubhouse turn, tracked the
decent pace while widest through the backstretch run, chased five wide into the far turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and faltered in the final furlong.
DUNGARVAN OAK was allowed to settle away from the start, saved ground into the first turn, unhurried through the backstretch run, was guided two wide
into the far turn and came in tight nearing the quarter marker, checked in tight quarters approaching the top of the lane, lacked a response in the stretch
drive and came up empty in the final stages. MONSIEUR broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, ceded the lead to TRIANGLE along the
first turn and stalked the decent pace into the backstretch run, was guided between rivals and contested the pace approaching the half-mile marker, took a
narrow lead into the far turn, was overtaken into upper stretch and tired in the final furlong. TRIANGLE showed good early speed away from the start,
assumed command into the first turn and set a contested pace into the backstretch run, carved out decent fractions nearing the half-mile marker and led
entering the far turn, lost position heading to the quarter marker, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off under his own power.
