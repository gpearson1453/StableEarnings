NAMBITI chased the leader two wide past the quarter pole, made the lead at the top of the stretch, drifted to the six path while under right handed urging
and prevailed under left handed coaxing. GOLDEN MONEY raced outside and finished determinedly to be clearly second best. DOUGS MORNING PICK
trailed into the stretch, swung wide and had a mild late rally in the middle of the racetrack. THE MAN CAN forwardly placed along the inside, was through
after a half. JACK BE FAST chased the pace three wide into the stretch then gave way. FOREIGN sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set the pace to
the top of the stretch then folded.

Footnotes
BOURBON OVER ICE never far back, surged three wide through the final sixteenth of a mile under strong handling and got up in the final strides. BAD
LITTLE BEAST always within range, dug in late three wide and just missed. SAHM TEQUILA chased the leader three wide and finished determinedly
between horses. FOREST SURVIVOR away alertly, set all the pace, opened a daylight lead on the turn, maintained that advantage until deep stretch and
was outfinished. LOST IN MANHATTAN trailed for nearly a half, swung wide then found his best stride late in the middle of the racetrack. VENETIAN
DREAM chased the pace along the inside into the stretch then faded. NO BANG NO BOOM (IRE) well placed, failed to respond. IT'S FATE failed to
menace. BUSTIN THE RULES was always outrun.

Footnotes
REDDEN was bumped at the start, pressed the pace along the rail early, dueled through the turn, shook clear in upper stretch under left handed urging and
proved best in a game effort. KETTLE KING pressed the pace three wide into the stretch, drifted out under right handed urging to the seven path and
finished second best. AGNELLO CITY stalked the pace into the stretch, began to close ground outside, was carried out to the middle of the racetrack by the
runner up causing his rider to steady nearing the wire. PLAYING BALL bore in bumping the winner at the start, saved ground and closed a gap late.
TAHLEQUAH JOE set the early pace under pressure two wide, battled through the turn and into the stretch then faded late. BIG TIME FLIRT bore out at the
start bumping BLAKE'S RYEN into IPPOLITO'S WONDER at the start, had good early speed along the rail then faded. BLAKE'S RYEN was bumped
between horses, squeezed then clipped heels shortly after the start and was never involved. IPPOLITO'S WONDER was bumped then squeezed at the start
and failed to reach contention.

Footnotes
SPARKLY stalked the pace into the stretch, closed willingly in the four path under right handed urging and got up in the final strides. SHARP AZ CAN BE
drifted out at the start, pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, drew off in upper stretch and just missed hanging on. NO PAY NO HAY
never far back, finished with good courage three wide. GETAWAY BAY sped to the front soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the rail into the
turn, remained a sharp threat into the stretch and weakened late. NOT OVER YET failed to menace. GIFTED GLITTER was bumped at the start and no
threat. VIVA LA MANANA drifted out bumping GIFTED GLITTER at the start and was no factor. DO NOT PASS trailed.
