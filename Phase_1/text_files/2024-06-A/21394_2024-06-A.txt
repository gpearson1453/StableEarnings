through the stretch run and finished gamely to the wire. DUNDIE set a pressured early pace along the inside and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile.
YEAGER prompt the early pace between rivals and weakened through the drive. BATTLE OF DOVER settled off the early going, raced four to five wide into
the upper stretch and had not enough. BOLD ADVANCE void of early speed, saved ground around the first turn into the backstretch, continued its inside run
around the far turn, angled out into the upper stretch and had no late rally. DOWN IN THE VALLEY was off slowly, raced five wide around the first turn,
angled in, saved ground past the quarter pole and never was a serious threat. LORD OF THE NILE stalked the pace along the inside and faded. RED'S
REVENGE was off slowly, raced mid pack early on, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. POLIGLOTA experienced a wide trip and
was eased up in the stretch. MAYHEMINTHEPALACE forwardly placed, tired readily and was eased through the stretch. COPPERLITE lag early on, raced

handling. HOLIDAY FANTASY prompt the early pace three deep from the outside of foes, raced near the rail into the upper lane and kept on gamely to the
wire. BOLDNESS tracked the top pair near the rail, shuffled back near the eighths pole, angled out through the far turn, drifted through the stretch drive and
kept on gamely to the wire racing from the far outside. SEVENTY SEVENTYCAT trailed early on, saved ground through the far turn into the lane and
needed more in the drive. UNDALAY showed good early foot to set the early pace two deep down the backstretch, dropped in a bit near the three eighths
pole and gave way in the drive. DREAM TRAP stalked the pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and failed to sustain a bid. ZONIC lost
ground to race far back and was eased up on through the stretch.

SUPER FREAKY GIRL was sent to a clear early lead, ridden along near the quarter pole, drifted deep stretch and prevailed under strong handling.
BEDROCK BIRDIE dropped back to race mid pack, moved up four wide around the far turn, raced six wide into the upper stretch and finished gamely to the
wire. BREEZERO stalked the top pair down the backstretch, raced five wide into the upper stretch, shifted to the inside of a drifting Super Freaky Girl and
kept on gamely to the wire. CHARLOTTES ROAD tracked the early leader two deep, asked near the three sixteenths pole and weakened late. TOP BLUE
dropped back to the trail early, raced four wide around the far turn and had no final winning bid. JAYANA settled off the early going racing in hand, raced two
wide near the quarter pole and had no late rally. TWIZZLE saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
OMAHA CITY dropped to the back of the pack early, advanced near the rail around the far turn, waited for racing room into the upper stretch, continued its
inside run, angled out near the eighth pole and surged up on the wire. HIGH LIMIT ROOM vied for the early lead from the outside of rivals, cleared near the
eighth pole, led nearing the wire and just missed in a game effort. OUR LEGAL TENDER raced mid pack early, saved ground into the upper stretch and
kept on willingly to the wire. INEVTABL CONECTION vied near the rail and weakened the final eighth of a mile. GALAXY MUSIC hustled two deep around
the far turn, shifted out five wide and raced even late with no closing run. OXYMORE sent along, raced in a bit tight between rivals early, shuffled back a bit,
raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. MAGICAL WARRIOR hard sent, checked sharply between rivals near the three eighths pole and
faded thereafter.

Footnotes
DIALITHIC showed good early speed to set the early pace and held well through the drive to prove best under strong handling. DUDEFOOLINGDARLING
rated along the rail to race in hand, shifted out three deep near the three sixteenths pole and slowly closed in on the winner in a game effort. MISS HOLLY
raced four wide around the first turn, raced from the outside down the backstretch, raced five wide around the far turn and finished willingly to the wire.
GOSSIPER stalked the pace, moved up four wide around the far turn, took aim into the upper stretch and flattened out. SHINING SKYE raced mid pack
early, swung seven wide into the upper stretch and closed in mildly. COOL TRICKS stalked the pace, raced three wide between near the quarter pole was
even in the drive with no closing run. CASTLE BORN rated back early along the inside under a firm hold, raced five wide near the eighth pole, shifted in late
and had no late rally. MISS MELODRAMATIC void of early speed, saved ground and never threatened. REPLENISH prompt the early pace from the outside
and was done early. MISS ARIZONA lost ground to race far back and was eased up on in the stretch.
