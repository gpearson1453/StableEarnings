Footnotes
EL CARDINAL away alertly set the pace through the turn drawing off in upper stretch being ridden out. MATERS N TATERS stalked the pace chasing to
upper stretch proving no match there saving place. MAS CHIKILIN a step slow early raced evenly down the lane passing a few late. KAZTHAROS chased
the pace racing inside to upper stretch weakening late. OFFUTT COLE hustled along pursued through the turn weakening in upper stretch. THE FILTER
played no factor. TRIGZ TOO rallied on the turn then flattened wide in upper stretch. LUCKY JUNIOR was always outrun.
