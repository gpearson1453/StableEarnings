Footnotes
DRIVE BY LAYOVER saved ground rallying into upper stretch surging clear gamely from the rail. SILENT TIGER chased the pace to upper stretch closing
willingly in the final yards. EMPEROROFTHEDARK broke sharply setting a clear pace to upper stretch faltering late. BROTHER SKYE rallied on the turn
vying willingly down the lane. BEYOND GONE chased on the turn weakening in upper stretch. SOUTHERN SENSE played no factor. LITTLE VAQUERO
was never involved. BAZOO a step slow early would tire.
