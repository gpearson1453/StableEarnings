KURT'S CHOICE set the early pace from the inside, opened up into the home turn, kept on and held. MY PARTNER GLEN was outrun early, advanced five
wide through the second turn, was gaining fast and just missed. WILD TIME was reserved early, raced six wide through the second turn, was closing fast,
needed more ground and finished a game third. DA GHOST raced in mid pack early, saved ground along the inside into the home turn and flattened out.
MR. COUGAR was void of any early speed, raced four wide into the second turn and offered no late rally. HANDSOME HARRY was unhurried in the early
stages, saved ground through out and never fired. ONE LUCKY BOY pressed the early pace, then settled back to follow the pace, raced three wide into the
second turn and tired. UNIQUE PATH tracked the early pace, raced four wide through the turn and was empty.

drifted out in the drive and was empty. MO MO TOWN pressed the early pace from between rivals and faded.

Footnotes
NORTH ARM BAY was allowed to settle early, angled out to the five path out of the turn, was gaining, took control mid stretch and held for the win. MR
NAVIGATOR raced in mid pack early, raced along the inside into the home turn, angled out in early stretch, was closing fast and just missed. JUST PLAIN
ORNERY set a clear early pace, raced along the inside into the turn, drifted out stretch, weakened late and held for third. FLY NIGHTLY followed the early
pace, raced between rivals into the home turn, angled to the inside early stretch and tired. BOURBON AFICIONADO was unhurried early, raced three wide
into the second turn, angled towards the inside, had to check mid stretch and offered no late rally. RUNAWAY READY was void of any early speed, saved
ground through the home turn, angled out stretch and never fired. TENTH STREET DON was reserved early, raced four wide into the second turn and
flattened out. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
