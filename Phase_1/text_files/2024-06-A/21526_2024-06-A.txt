EIGHT STRAIGHT raced up close along the rail in opening stages then edged ahead and vied inside a trio up the backstretch, continued to battle for
command through the turn, shook free approaching the furlong marker, continued to lead the way under pressure and just lasted over fast gaining runner
up. WICKED PRINCE tracked the embattled top flight up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, angled four wide and launched a bid in upper
stretch, gathered strong momentum under firm handling, finished with a surge and got denied by a nose. LAZARUS vied four deep for the lead up the
backstretch, continued to battle outside around the turn, could not match strides with eventual winner in upper stretch, remained in contention and sustained
a steady bid. VYING EDGE took a slim lead soon after the start and quickly became engaged by a trio of pursuers, vied two wide between rivals into the
turn, failed to move on with EIGHT STRAIGHT approaching the eighth pole, briefly remained in contention then weakened. LUCKY'S SECRET dueled three
wide between rivals up the backstretch, flattened from top flight near the mid-way point on the turn, came four wide into the lane and had no late response.

TALONS TIME was nicely rated and settled just off the top pair in the opening quarter, let out a notch entering the turn then came under a ride turning for
home, hustled along three wide into upper stretch, roused forward and cleared the lead at the sixteenth pole, drifted wider, shown the whip, tapped once
right handed and finished ridden out. COLORFUL NATIVE vied outside of ELIOT NESS up the backstretch, shook free past the mid-way point on the turn,
led the way two wide into the lane, got overtaken by the winner approaching the sixteenth pole and just lasted for place. LEAPIN TY MAN rated off the top
trio through early stages, picked up the pace near the inside around the turn, then launched a two wide bid at the head of the lane, steadily edged up closer
and just missed place. ELIOT NESS vied inside of COLORFUL NATIVE up the backstretch, continued in striking distance around the turn, stayed on along
the inside into upper stretch then steadily weakened. DREADPIRATEROBERTS raced off the pace, chased three wide around the turn and lacked a rally in
the lane. LEADING THE CAUSE raced in the back, saved ground entering the stretch and never threatened.

GISELE'S MAP quickly cleared the lead and angled inside, set the pace up the backstretch then vied inside of CLASSIC CASH around the turn, shook free
at the head of the lane and kept clear under steady encouragement. CLASSIC CASH drifted out after the start, carrying MY HEARTS ON FIRE into the path
of ESPIRIT ROUGE causing her to be taken up sharply, continued forwardly placed behind the leader, vied with the eventual winner around the turn, could
not match strides at the head of the lane but stayed on with response. DELACINA was off slow at the start, hustled up along the inside and gained
contention, raced inside off the top pair around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, came under a ride and kept on to clear the rest. MY HEART'S ON
FIRE got carried out shortly after the start when CLASSIC CASH drifted out and pushed out into the path of ESPRIT ROUGE causing rival to check sharply,
ran on and raced in striking range two wide around the turn then flattened out in the lane. ESPRIT ROUGE lost path when CLASSIC CASH drifted out
shortly after the start, was forced to be taken up sharply and dropped back, continued off the pace, saved ground around the turn and never threatened.
SUPER MODEL STROLL steadied shortly after the start when CLASSIC CASH drifted out, raced well off the pace, chased three wide around the turn and
failed to move into contention. SHARP ROSA raced off the pace, chased two wide around the turn and made no impact. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY

HURRICANE FIRE dueled inside of PRETTYWITTYANDWISE up the backstretch and around the turn, continued to battle on into the lane, shook free
approaching the final sixteenth and finished clear. PRETTYWITTYANDWISE vied outside of HURRICANE FIRE from the onset, continued to match strides
around the turn and into the lane, could not move on with eventual winner past the sixteenth pole and had to settle for second best. JOYFUL IMAGE raced
off the early pace, hustled along three to four wide into upper stretch and gained show. ANDREA DIANE tracked the pace near the inside, angled out late on
the backstretch, came three to four paths wide into the lane and had no late kick. LITTLE TAP DANCER chased the embattled top pair in early stages,
continued in range three wide around the turn then gave way. ESCAPE MAP was off slow at the start, lacked early speed and never menaced. LIL
KNOCKOUT raced outside off the early leaders and failed to move into close contention.

Footnotes
TEMPTED MISSION led the way up the backstretch then took on the challenge of LETTHERAINSETTLEIT with three furlongs left to run, dueled around the
turn, continued hooked up in a heated battle down the lane, dug in gamely and edged away late. LETTHERAINSETTLEIT was forwardly placed in the
opening quarter then advanced to challenge TEMPTED MISSION for the lead entering the turn, battled two wide into the lane, fought on gamely then
yielded late. ATTA PARTY raced in the second flight and tracked the pace into the turn, edged a bot closer and sat just off the top pair at the quarter pole,
hustled along into stretch run, flattened slightly off the leading duo but stayed on with response, edged up closer racing in tandem with COALMINERS
KITTEN and dug in gamely to capture show. COALMINER'S KITTEN raced in the second flight heading into the turn, saved ground then tipped out two to
three wide entering the top of the lane, edged closer racing in tandem with ATTA PARTY and got nipped for show on the wire. DRIFTER raced off the
second flight late entering the turn, swung five wide into the lane and had no late response. LODE OF BLARNEY raced near midpack early on, continued in
range leaving the backstretch, was ridden three to four wide late on the turn then faded in the lane. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP saved ground and never
threatened.

the pace along the rail, sat patiently near the inside around the far turn, angled out three wide entering top of the lane, kicked in gamely when given cue,
surged to the wire and got a nose up in time. ZATARA was forwardly placed and tracked the leader up the backstretch, moved up to engage DESPERATE

DESPERATE MAN sprinted to the lead and angled inside heading into the first turn, tugged wanting to do more while being rated on top under slight
restraint, settled nicely on top and set the pace up the backstretch, took on the challenge from ZATARA mid-way around the far turn, dueled inside into
stretch run, fought on gamely to the furlong marker then weakened late. FIRESPITTEN KITTEN was forwardly placed around the first turn and remained in

Footnotes
VELOCITOR was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked two wide up the backstretch, advanced to engage MINE THAT STAR for the lead
mid-way around the far turn, matched strides then took on the challenge of rail running AINT LIFE GRAND at the quarter pole, chased after aforementioned
foe into upper stretch, dueled two wide for the lead into the final sixteenth, dug in gamely and edged away late. AIN'T LIFE GRAND was briefly restless in
the gate then broke sharp and settled nicely while saving ground around the first turn, remained inside and stalked the pace up the backstretch, slipped
through a narrow opening along the rail and challenged rivals for the lead at the quarter pole, cut the corner and shook free at the head of the lane, took on
the challenge from VELOCITOR mid-stretch, fought back gamely then failed to move on late. MINE THAT STAR led the way around the first turn and set
the pace up the backstretch, took on the challenge of VELOCITOR mid-way around the far turn, vied past the quarter pole then failed to move on with the
top pair and kept on for a share. HAYES STRIKE raced in range three wide up the backstretch, edged closer, raced in aim three to four wide at the quarter
pole, flattened turning for home and just missed show. DOUBLE CROWN raced off the early pace, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and failed to
rally. ALEJANDRO was not too far back being rated just off the early pace, given cue along the outside entering the final turn, failed to move on past the five
sixteenths pole and gave way. KEEN HEIR raced in the back, lost contact with the field around the far turn and was distanced.
