Footnotes
VAYESTA stalked the pace from the outside, moved up four wide from the outside of foes around the far turn, was five wide into the upper stretch and
finished well to edge away under strong handlling. NEW BABY dropped back to race mid pack early on, raced two wide around the far turn, was five wide
into the upper lane and finished gamely to the wire. STARSHIP DYNASTY raced near the back of the pack in the early stages, moved up to split rivals four
deep near the eighth pole and rallied willingly to the wire. BLACK AND SILVER trailed early, advanced into the far turn, swung wide into the lane to race
from the far outside and moved up to improve position. MISS DIZ was off a step slow, saved ground through the far turn, angled out four wide and had not
enough in the drive. NOELLE dueled outside of foes and weakened the final eighth of a mile. PIZZICATO was off slowly, dropped back with the second
flight, raced six wide into the upper stretch and raced even with no closing run. LACE CURTAIN dueled for the early lead between rivals and faded. APPLE
SAUCY dueled near the rail and gave way.

BOOMCCHERO prompt the early pace setter two deep from the outside, challenged near the five sixteenths pole and edged up late under all out pressure.
ROAR READY dropped back early on, moved up three wide around the far turn, fanned six wide into the upper stretch rallied to narrowly get up for the
place position. RHUM SAINT ESPRIT set a pressured early pace near the inside, dug in late and gave way grudgingly. REZASROLEX dropped back to
race mid pack early, race near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had not enough late. SOUND OF THE BEAST tracked the top trio from
the outside, raced three wide through the far turn and weakened a bit late. EMBRACE THE DREAM was forwardly placed early on, saved ground through
the far turn and faded. JIVE was off slowly, trailed early on, raced five wide in the lane and failed to respond.

Footnotes
KING FALIERO set his own uncontested early pace just of the inside, raced well off the inside in the stretch and held a clear margin under steady pressure.
EKATI KING stalked the pace, raced near the rail past the quarter pole, angled out and finished gamely to the wire. CRYPTO MAN tracked the early leader
near the inside, angled off the rail to race five wide in the drive and weakened a bit late. AWESOME TRAIN settled off the early pace, raced four wide
around the far turn and had no late rally. FIRST SLEW trailed early on, saved ground through the far turn, eased out and had no response. LASSO dropped
back to race mid pack, saved ground and failed to sustain a bid. MEGA GLORIOUS veered out sharply at the start, lost ground to race far back and was
eased up on through the stretch run.

Footnotes
PERILOUS tracked the top pair along the inside down the backstretch through the far turn, shifted out three deep and finished well to edge up under strong
handling. TIZ READY quick to begin to set the early pace, clear near the eighth pole and was wore down late in a game effort. LIONZA chased the top trio,
raced three wide around the far turn and kept on willingly to the wire. SPICY GUACAMOLE angled in to saved ground through the far turn, raced from the
inside into the upper lane and had no final winning bid. ERNESTINA void of early speed, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a serious
threat. RAPID TULA pressed the early leader two deep and gave way. BIANKA HEART was off slow, clipped heels midway through the far turn from the
inside and never was a threat after a troubled trip. BARBARESCO BABY coaxed along early, bolted through the far turn, eased back in through the stretch
drive and was never a factor.

game effort. CANT STOP DREAMING dropped back near the back of the pack early on, swung wide into the lane and moved up to improve position.

Footnotes
FRANKIE'S EMPIRE was off slowly, urged early after the poor start, advanced through the far turn, raced five wide into the upper stretch and finished
strongly to edge clear late under strong handling. BIG CITY rated along to race in hand early, had an inside run around the far turn through the stretch and
finished well to be second best. IMPROPTUDE forwardly placed to lay up close, ridden three wide through the far turn, angled out six wide through the
stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. UNEQUIVOCALLY showed good early foot to set the early pace and faltered the final eighth of a mile. PURE
CLASS settled off the early going, raced six deep into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. BRAWN void of early speed, saved ground and never
threatened. SHEA D WORLD tracked the early leader three deep and stopped.

Footnotes
GIURO set a pressured early pace near the inside, dug in near the eighth while drifting a bit, brushed rival and prevailed in a determined run under strong
pressure. NO PLEBEIAN settled off the early pace, advanced from the outside around the far turn, exchanged bump with Dixie Preach into the upper stretch
racing seven deep, worked between through the drive and finished gamely to get up for the place position. KALIMAN pressed the early leader from the
outside, brushed near the eighth pole as Giuro came out a bit, jockey objection was filed for interference against Giuro but stewards ruled no change. DIXIE
PREACH unhurried early on, fanned eight wide while exchanging bump into the upper stretch and kept on willingly to the wire.. VINNY AND LEO dropped
back early to race with the second flight, raced four wide around the far turn and had not enough in the drive. FLAT CAP raced mid pack early, was near the
inside into the upper lane, shifted out a bit to race three deep and was even with no closing run. ALBERT SON was off slowly, trailed early on and had no
late rally. SAMMY'S SAMARITAN stalked the pace, raced three wide between rivals near the quarter pole and weakened. PRAISEWORTHY raced four
wide around both turns and had no response. DANCINGINTHESTORM stalked the top pair and faded in the drive.
