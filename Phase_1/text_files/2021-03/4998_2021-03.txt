Footnotes
MISS LIANA away without apparent mishap, established control in short order, rated kindly showing the way from along the inside route, had already
increased the advantage by a substantial margin when called upon for more deep into the furlong grounds, saw the runner up closing the gap well in the last
eighth, but had more than enough itself to hold sway. CADEAU DE PAIX pursued the pace three wide, bumped with COVER PHOTO approaching the
five-sixteenths marker, came under a ride spinning into the lane, settled into path four, had a good finish down the center of the strip rallying for the place.
AWESOME ALANA tracked the winner from the pocket, hand urged making her way on the turn, tipped into the two path stepping onto the head of the
stretch, stayed on for the show. DIRTY BIRD inched her way over to the rail by the conclusion of the backstretch, cut the corner into the stretch, fell short of
snagging third. COVER PHOTO remained stationed in two path after the field had been sent off and running, got set down midpoint on the turn, made some
contact with the second place finisher a sixteenth later, fanned out into path five from upper to midlane, becoming the widest off, had no response. LIFE ON
THE EDGE stalked the pace from the two path on the turn, folded.

Footnotes
OVERDRESSED got bumped at the start by INVESTMENT GRADE, who broke inwards, chased two then three wide down the backstretch and then four
wide through the turn coming under coaxing just inside the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied outside a pair to take command just
inside the eighth pole, edged away under a drive kept to task. TAKE IT OFF bobbled at the break, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in between foes latched on the leader to near the sixteenth marker, then ran on to secure the place honors.
ROSEY'S PEACH four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
INVESTMENT GRADE broke in at the start bumping OVERDRESSED, got lightly coaxed to establish the front shortly after the break and showed the way
just off the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and relented
inside the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages. MAGNIFICENT MAGS three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun
three wide for home and weakened. MISS COMEDIAN chased just off the inside until tucked to the rail half a mile from home, got coaxed along midway on
the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. STAY HOME MAMA stumbled at the start recovering outwards, angled in to chase
along the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WILD BANKER settled into the two path prior to departing the backstretch, had a good view of the three front runners a short distance up ahead vying for
command, was given his cue swinging four wide into the lane, clawed up to TIERGAN, sparking off a duel between them, shifted inward when fed some
right side pressure with approximately a sixteenth go, taking the earlier-mentioned opponent for an abbreviated ride, proved best shortly afterwards and
edged clear. TIERGAN pressed the issue from path three as the outermost of a trio for three-quarters, struck the front end to lead by a narrow margin as the
third fraction was being finalized, got roused stepping onto the head of the stretch, had the winner bearing down hard from the outside by the end of the run
through the furlong grounds, shied inward, reacting to the top one's coming in right around the sixteenth pole, relinquished for good and weakened into the
place. TOO EARLY cut into the two path, was between rivals disputing the pace for the first six furlongs, came under a drive springing from the
five-sixteenths pole, became unhitched with the runner up a furlong down the road, stayed for the show. RIFT VALLEY two wide onto the turn, got sent out
into path five exiting it, becoming the widest of all, made no headway. MOONLIGHT NOW argued from along the rail against a pair of rivals until the
three-sixteenths pole, gave way. TRUE PALACE strung out two to three wide on the bend bringing up the rear, strolled towards path five for entrance into
the stretch, steadily fell back, protected to the wire.

Footnotes
ROSE E HOLIDAY four then three wide in aim of the front, advanced to be between foes midway on the turn prompting the pace, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, had WICKED HAPPY advance outside and take command inside that station and was placed to a drive in response, swung two to three
wide into upper stretch, took over command at the three-sixteenths and edged clear under a drive kept busy to the finish. WICKED HAPPY five then four
wide in pursuit, advanced four wide outside a trio through the latter portion of the turn to take command nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper
stretch, got collared at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive chasing the winner home while well clear of the rest to be along second best. CHEROKEE
SONG established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from the presence of MALIBU ANTHEM to the outside, tucked
inside half a mile from home and faced threat from a pair and then a trio through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and yielding command
just inside the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. MALIBU ANTHEM prompted the pace of the aforementioned foe three then two
wide, was in between foes through the turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. JORDY CAN TAP
chased three then two wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, went three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. QUEEN DAVEIGH chased just off
the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, went five wide for home and was eased through the stretch. CRYSTAL ORB chased two then three wide
coming under a prolonged drive from the half mile pole, went four wide through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was eased to the
finish.

Footnotes
DAVID'S GEM retained the advantage after out-breaking the competition, carved out the pace towards the two path, loosely contested and offering
resistance on the left side of the bit, headed for the three path heading onto the top of the lane, was given his cue, emerged at the eighth pole in possession
of its largest advantage, came after after being fed some left side stick work a sixteenth later, but had no difficulty holding sway. TRUEBELIEVE at a
considerable distance from off the rail throughout, stalked the pacesetter from the four path, angled one path farther off the rail for the stretch drive, got
staved off. COBBLE HILL took up position in midpack, travelled three wide on the turn, shifted one wider entering the stretch, made no headway in the final
furlong. LARCENY spotted in the two path by the top of the turn, was gradually worked into the five wide down the lane, rallied mildly to mainly improve
position. DR. DEVERA'S WAY remained in the two path after the field had been sent off and running, went about the turn from between rivals, spun into the
lane, failed to fire. PRINCIPAL DANCER forwardly placed three wide, was switched over to a drive a short distance from the end of the bend, went into the
lane, stayed on as a forward factor for a little while longer then backed away. JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ faltered after undergoing a ground-saving journey. Due
to a timer malfunction the five furlong time is unavailable.

Footnotes
BANK ON SHEA established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive under threat through the length of the stretch knocking heads with O'TROUBLE stubbornly clinging to the
lead and gamely held by a nostril on the wire. O'TROUBLE chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, intensified the pressure on that rival
through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down swinging three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive getting on
near even terms and dueled through the length of the stretch fighting on gamely to the finish but was ultimately denied by a sliver at the end. SOMEBODY
chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors.
MISTER WINSTON broke in at the start and was pinched back between foes due to pressure inside from EDGE OF FIRE and pressure outside from
MANOLITO, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. POPIZAR three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and tired. MANOLITO raced a bit rank early on under restraint chasing two then
three wide and was steadied and eased off when pulling three times down the backstretch, came under coaxing midway on the turn, angled five wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. EDGE OF FIRE broke out at the start, chased along the inside under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide
for home and trailed.

CIVIL WAR got set up in the four path after being shouldered by BLU GROTTO, flashed some interest as three-quarters was being completed, got cued up
for the drive home, forged to the lead during the ensuing furlong, steadily added to the margin, kept to some encouragement to the wire. CENTAVO slid
over to the rail approaching the half mile pole, cut the corner into the lane, under a drive, launched itself to the place with a sustained rail rally. BLU
GROTTO out after losing his footing springing from the starting gate, made some light contact with the winner afterwards, went on to assume a prominent
position, contested the pace from path two, struck the front a short distance from the quarter pole, got turned loose heading onto the top of the lane, was
soon overhauled by the top one, weakened into the show slot. MAKE IT IN NY rode the rail for six furlongs, swung out five wide for the stretch run, made no
late headway. SWINGING STICKS two wide onto the turn, got sent out six wide exiting it, mustered up a mild stretch response. DOUBLEPOUR tracked the
front runners from along the inside route, got let out a notch abandoning it at the five-sixteenths pole, completed the maneuver in the general area of path
four a furlong late, gave way. JUDGE BERN pursued the pace two wide in midpack, commenced the stretch one path wider, tired. BOWING SNOWMAN a
forward factor in the three path, folded. NOCTILUCENT cut over to the inside holding a slim advantage early on the backstretch, led the way, shadowed by
BLU GROTTO from the outside, came under stronger handling a few jumps short of the quarter pole after having been headed, battled for another
sixteenth, retreated.
