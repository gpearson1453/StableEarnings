furlong and went gamely to the wire. MISS LADY ANN stalked the pace from the far outside, went five wide into the turn then angled into the three path,
churned on inside the furlong grounds and gained the show. RANEEM pressed the pace from between rivals, vied for the lead with between foes around the
turn and into the stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. PASITO dropped back to trail early, went three then two wide around the turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
CHROME OF OUR OWN stalked the speed from the rail position, angled out leaving the turn, entered the lane three wide, urged left-handed at the eighth
pole then put in a late bid and edged reeled in BIG AL'S PRINCESS in the closing moments. BIG AL'S PRINCESS set the pace between rivals then cleared
approaching the three-eighths, held command to deep stretch but could not stave off the winner nearing the wire. LULU D' ORO pressed the pace from
inside, chased the leader through the turn and into the stretch, came back along the fence in the final furlong but could not summon the needed late kick.
BEST OF SHOW broke in then lugged out early, chased three wide into the turn, five wide into the drive and finished evenly. BRIO IS AWESOME had early
speed outside the top pair, failed to match strides around the turn, entered the lane four wide and faded out of contention. ZU ZU FLYNN lacked early
speed, took the turn four then five wide and proved no menace.

LAW PROFESSOR went four wide around the clubhouse turn, raced in range off the rail, entered the stretch three wide, drew alongside the leader in
mid-stretch then cleared foe with a sixteenth to go and inched away. HARBORED MEMORIES was closest in pursuit early, bid outside FENWAY at the
quarter pole, cleared that rival in upper stretch and could not match strides with the winner in the final sixteenth. THERE GOES HARVARD entered the first
turn five wide then angled into the four path, continued widest up the backstretch, entered the stretch three wide and finished willingly for the show.
HUDSON RIDGE traveled along the inside then moved into the two path on the backstretch, exited the second turn four wide and showed a mild response
in the final furlong. STAR SAILOR stalked the pace from inside then entered the stretch two wide, asked in the drive but lacked the needed response.
FENWAY away quickly from the gate and crossed over to the inside to the set the pace, challenged from outside at the quarter pole, lost command in upper
stretch and tired in the final furlong. MUCHO DEL ORO tracked two wide early then angled to the inside and saved ground around the far turn, eased in the
stretch and walked off.

CITY RAGE set the pace inside a pair of rivals, cleared nearing the quarter pole, coaxed upper then urged right and left-handed and held well. ONE FLEW
SOUTH stalked outside a rival in the two path, angled four wide into the stretch, finished well and kept gaining on the winner. RAGER chased the speed
from inside, saved ground into the drive, drifted out inside the eighth pole and lacked a late bid. QUICK FINISH jumped the track crossing surfaces early,
pressed the pace between the top pair, chased the leader two wide into the lane, was bothered by RAGER past the eighth pole and flattened in the late
stages. PROMISE NOTHING showed early speed outside the top pair, chased three deep into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH angled to the rail early and stalked near the inside, entered the second turn in the two path, angled out on that turn and into the
stretch, rallied widest and proved best. HALF HOPING took the first turn four then three wide, stalked off the rail and came three wide into the stretch, tipped
out in the drive, put in a bid mid-stretch but got outkicked by the winner. SUPERSONIC FLYER dueled for the lead outside SIDEWAYS SUANCES around
the first turn then pressed that foe up the backstretch, put a nose in front at the three-eighths, held a short lead into the stretch, cleared rival in upper lane
and got caught with a sixteenth then stayed on for the show. SIDEWAYS SUANCES dueled for the lead from inside early, inched ahead of outside rival on
the backstretch to assert control, lost command at the three-eighths pole, fought back through the turn, could not match strides in the final furlong, changed
leads late and was eased nearing the wire. HERE COMES RALPHIE raced off the pace, angled in leaving the second turn and weakened. SUGAR KISSES
stumbled at the start, settled at the back, angled out around the far turn then further out into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
TWENTYSEVENTROUTS away quickly from the gate, set all the pace to the stretch, asked left-handed in the final furlong and stayed clear. ELGOFRANCO
broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, stalked three wide into the turn, moved down to the two path and traveled outside a rival into the drive, tipped
out in upper stretch, could not summon the needed late kick to make an impact on the winner but proved second best. MY TIGRESS stumbled and got
bumped at the start, tracked off the inside then angled in near the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground while inside a rival on the turn and flattened out in
the late stages. DUAL REALITY broke in at the start, came off the rail early, moved back to the two path nearing the turn, remained two wide into the stretch
and was never a factor. SLEWPYS LAST SONG chased off the inside, raced a bit off the rail through the turn and tired. HUMOR ME HARPER chased from
inside, dropped back into and around the turn, saved ground into the stretch, eased in the lane and walked off.

TIME FOR EBBY off alertly in the beginning, attended the pace three deep, chased four wide around the turn, rallied late from outside and wore down the
runner-up in the final sixteenth to get up. KRISTI'S TIGER dueled for the lead from inside, cleared rival in upper stretch, challenged by the winner and deep
stretch and yielded grudgingly. LI'L GRAZEN off a bit slow to begin, went up between foes to take control, dueled with KRISTI'S TIGER through the turn and
into the stretch, flattened in the late stages but lasted for the show. HOMEHOME chased four deep up the backstretch, took the turn five wide, lacked the
needed late kick but kept on and missed the show.

Footnotes
MARCKIE'S WATER set the pace from inside, inched away briefly around the far turn, challenged from outside and dueled with FRENCH GETAWAY down
the stretch, put that rivals away then held on over the late charge from NOBLE THROUGHT in the final strides. NOBLE THOUGHT settled at the pace and
moved inside, came off the rail and went between rivals on the backstretch, angled four wide around the far turn, rallied widest in the lane and missed.
FRENCH GETAWAY bumped leaving the gate, unhurried in the beginning, went three deep on the backstretch, took closer order nearing the far turn, took
aim two wide into the stretch, bid outside and dueled with MARCKIE'S WATER in the stretch, put a nose in front at the eighth pole but flattened out in deep
stretch. MOVE OVER (GB) bumped with inner rival then checked soon after the start, pulled early first time through the stretch, settled off the pace, went
between foes on the backstretch, entered the far turn two wide then exited that bend three wide, rallied in the drive but needed to find more late. NEW
YEAR tucked inside early on the first turn, steadied briefly behind rival near the three-eighths, remained inside to the stretch, came off the rail a bit then
shifted back inside in upper stretch and improved position. FULL OF LUCK (CHI) stalked a bit off the rail then in the two path, went between rivals on the
backstretch, chased two wide into the stretch, tipped out in the drive and lacked further response. FABOZZI brushed from outside at the start, was up close
early outside the leader then chased along the rail into the stretch, tired and was eased in the lane and walked off. MO BOB (IRE) bumped with outside rival
early, stalked the pace from inside, took an awkward step at the three-eighths pole, dropped back around the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.
WORTHY TURK bumped with inside rival at the start, tracked off the rail then outside rivals on the backstretch, entered the far turn three wide then moved
into the two path, eased in the stretch and walked off.
