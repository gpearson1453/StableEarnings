Footnotes
MIGHTY FAST broke in front, set all the pace and prevailed under left handed urging. GATTO MARRONE prompted the pace along the rail through the first
turn, steadied and angled outside the winner past the six furlong marker, chased that one and was steadily gaining ground lat. CONSILIUM advanced into
the far turn then leveled off in the five path. SLATE lacked room along the rail through the first turn then passed tiring rivals through the stretch.
TRIBULATION was no factor. AMERICAN SOLUTION inside, lacked the needed response. MIKE IS READY improved position before a half then came up
empty. YESUS STAR trailed.

GRECIAN PRINCE stalked the dueling leaders into the turn, circled three wide to gain a narrow advantage entering the stretch, dueled to the furlong marker
then finished full of run under right handed urging to win as much the best. ALYCAR FLASH matched strides for the lead two wide then along the inside until
deep stretch then was no match for the winner and just held on for second. FELON dueled for the lead along the rail into the stretch, dropped back and
shifted off the rail to the five path, came on again late and just missed getting up for second. EMPIREMEISTER close up early, faded on the turn. OPRAH'S
RANGER was no factor. GREG RULES DA was through early.

furlong marker then finished full of run to win as much the best while under brisk handling. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE broke in front, set a pressured pace early,
shook clear on the turn, maintained her advantage until mid stretch then was no match for the winner while well clear for second. RONNI'S DAY pressed the
pace along the inside into the turn, had speed into the stretch while drifting to the six path then weakened. OHIO STORM well placed, failed to respond.
LEMON SLUSH was no factor. ELUSIVE SYLVIE was no threat. CRYPTO'S IMAGE trailed.

Footnotes
EMPEROR'S GOLD stalked the pace from the inside, waited, shifted three wide nearing the quarter pole, battled until deep stretch, edged clear under right
handed urging and held on by a narrow margin. GEH SCHNELL well placed, closed four wide on the far turn, dropped back a bit, dug in determinedly late
and was steadily cutting into the winners' advantage through the final yards. DIMATE allowed to settle, circled rivals five wide before the far turn, kept on
two wide to make the lead before the quarter pole, set a pressured pace until deep stretch then came up empty. FATHER DENNIS failed to menace.
TRULY ELITE passed tiring rivals. MEMPHISINMAY battled for the lead two wide then along the inside for a little over a half mile then gave way on the far
turn. ACCOUSTICAL had speed from the start four wide, advanced steadily to make the lead before a half, dropped inside, dueled into the stretch then gave
way. APPROVETHISMESSAGE close up, failed to respond. SUPER BEAU contested the early lead two wide and stopped on the far turn. NETAS was
through after a half.

pace from the inside into the stretch, angled out and finished second best. CANDY KINGDOM unhurried early, had a mild late rally along the rail through the
stretch. LIGHTNING JACK went evenly. SILVER CONNECTION pressured the winner two wide into the far turn then weakened late. MOST
SANDISFACTORY well placed, failed to respond. RAKEEZ was no factor. EXTRORBINAIRE trailed.

MOUNTAIN MELODIES brushed at the start, was allowed to settle, closed willingly in the five path three wide through the stretch and got up in the final
strides. THE NEW MIAMI dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch, dug gamely between horses two wide and finished second best. CANDY FOR
ALL trailed into the far turn, closed willingly along the rail to make the lead in deep stretch then was outfinished. IT'S ALL CASH brushed at the start, offered
a bid along the inside into the stretch, lacked room and altered course to the four path then leveled off. ANTHONY'S GIRL was no factor. PABLO CREEK
stalked the pace into the far turn, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole then came up empty while swerving through deep stretch. MOR
BREEZE battled for the lead two wide for six furlongs then was used up.
