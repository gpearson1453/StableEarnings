Footnotes
INDIAN HEAD NICKLE set a clear early pace, raced off the rail into both turns, opened up in early stretch and drew off as an easy winner. FISHEL was
unhurried early, angled out to the eight passed out of the home turn, passed foes late and was up for second. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND stalked the early
pace from the inside and held for third. BROZILIAN (BRZ) was void of any early speed, angled out to the seven path in mid stretch and offered no rally.
PAROLEE chased the early pace, went three wide into the second turn and weakened. KENJILOOKSLUCKY was taken back early, saved ground into the
home turn and was no factor. GO TIME raced in mid pack early, went between rivals into the second turn and flattened out. FLICKERING LIGHT was
allowed to settle early, went four wide into the second turn and faded.
