Footnotes
LI'L MEATBALL, urged to a forward placing along the rail racing just off the first flight, advanced inside foes to bid for command entering upper stretch and
went well clear under brisk handling. UNCLE HAL, in touch with the leaders three wide prompting the pace racing to the turn, pressed the issue into upper
stretch but proved only second best. DIDNT DO IT, urged inside foes just off the rail disputing the pace into the turn, continued between foes into upper
stretch and gave way in late stages. BRANDT tracked off the second flight racing four wide to the turn and continued in that path while gaining some
position. RAOFTHESUN tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the turn but offered no closing bid. EXECUTIVE DECREE, urged between foes
disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way nearing upper stretch. WILD WINTER, slow to gather stride, angled to the inside nearing
the turn while being prompted to gain some position but came up empty entering upper stretch. MIDNIGHT BOLT dropped out early.

Footnotes
PURPLE PEOPLEEATER, urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset just off the inside racing into the turn, edged clear in upper stretch and
was kept to firm encouragement to maintain a safe advantage to the end. DIVA DANA stalked just off the first flight three wide racing into the turn, was
prompted to advance on those foes nearing upper stretch but proved only second best. GALIT JAK bobbled at the start, settled well off the leaders, swung
out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. MADAME ROUGE hopped at the start, was righted to track the leaders
between foes racing into the turn and continued evenly near the inside racing into the stretch. DON'T EATTHE APPLE, urged forcing the pace outside a
rival from the outset into the turn, gave way midstretch. VICE GRIP tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the lane but offered no rally.
TWINKIESANDTURNIPS, urged in brief pursuit along the inside in the opening quarter, retreated early. PANDORICA broke a bit slowly and was soon
outpaced.

Footnotes
TRULY tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, split foes racing into upper stretch while shifting out three wide, wrested the
advantage late and held TREASURE TAILS safe under firm handling. The latter settled last to the backstretch, swung six wide racing into upper stretch and
continued willingly to close the gap on the winner nearing the wire. SHEDANCESFORFATE tracked off the first flight three wide in the opening half,
advanced in that path racing into upper stretch to gain a brief advantage but was collared by the top pair late. SCHATZI settled in the last flight along the
inside, gained some position between foes nearing upper stretch, then continued to improve position along the inside in the stretch. REMARKABLE SILVER
tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the far turn, came through to challenge nearest the rail in upper stretch but quickly flattened out.
ECLECTIC SOUL, caught four wide tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued evenly three wide between foes into the lane.
ANDIAMA tracked off the second flight three wide between foes in the opening stages, advanced four wide entering the far turn to lodge a brief bid in that
path nearing upper stretch but quickly flattened out. DEESSE, urged to dispute the pace from the outset along the inside, dueled to upper stretch and gave
way. BAHAMIAN MOON angled inwards to prompt the pace outside a rival in the opening half, pressed the pace between foes on the far turn and gave way
entering the lane. BEAUTIFUL DIVA tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch and steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
B C BEAUTIFUL broke sharply, angled inwards racing through the backstretch to dictate the pace between foes, shook well clear racing into upper stretch
under firm encouragement, then was gathered up in the closing stages once the issue was decided. RANSOMS REWARD switched out early to gain terms
with the second flight, was eased off that position nearing the turn, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance and continued
in that path to close the gap. BUNNY PRINCESS, unhurried in early stages between foes tracking off the second flight, shifted out four wide racing into the
lane and continued well enough to prevail for a share. DAWNDETTI tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn and continued three deep
between foes in the closing stages while failing to threaten. DUDES LAWYER, urged to a forward placing three wide tracking just off the pacesetter racing
into the turn, gave way after a half. AMERICAN OF COURSE dislodged her rider to run loose momentarily before the start, then was caught in tight quarters
at the break, was hustled up inside foes to gain a position just off the pacesetter racing into the turn but came up empty racing into upper stretch. REALLY
LIKE LAURA swerved in at the start crossing into the path of LA BELLA VITA and dropped out early. LA BELLA VITA, steadied out of tight quarters at the
start, was prompted to gain a position off the second flight while angling inside racing into the turn and faded from contention early.

HERE COMES JACKIE was rated outside foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep nearing the lane and
continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage in that path in the closing stages under firm left handed pressure to prevail. DUCHESS OF
SUSSEX stalked just off the leader outside a rival racing to the backstretch, advanced three deep to wrest the advantage midway through the far turn,
contested the issue outside a rival on a narrow advantage past midstretch but was collared nearing the wire. NO WAY JOSE (IRE) stalked just off the
pacesetter inside a rival in the opening half, bid for command along the rail nearing upper stretch, then ducked out momentarily under left handed pressure
in late stretch while failing to match terms with the top pair. CATSOUTOFTHEBAG tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, was
urged to bid between foes just off the inside nearing midstretch, was momentarily caught in tight quarters near the sixteenth marker while being taken in
hand the remainder of the race. LADY FATIMA, a bit rank while pulling against restraint inside foes just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, swung
out five wide racing into upper stretch but finished evenly late. CHICK'S SHADOW hopped at the start, settled last while angling inside, saved ground to
upper stretch but offered no rally. ALEXANDRA KAY urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow
margin racing to the far turn and gave way between foes midway through that bend. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF CATSOUTOFTHEBAG
LODGED CLAIMS OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDERS OF NO WAY JOSE (IRE) AND DUCHESS OF SUSSEX ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE
STRETCH BUT THOSE CLAIMS WERE DISALLOWED.

MERMAID KISSES stalked just off the first flight just off the inside under light reserve racing through the backstretch, split rivals nearing upper stretch to
quickly wrest command, went clear under firm encouragement and was gathered up in late stages after the issue had been decided. MI CLEOPATRA AND I
was rated between foes off the first flight racing through the backstretch, shifted to the five path leaving the midway point of the turn and continued in that
path to the closing stages while edging a rival for the place honors nearing the wire. PLAY THE MAX broke sharply, attended the pace three deep racing to
the turn, pressed the issue into upper stretch but couldn't match the winner and lost second late. TREASURED INFO, urged between foes disputing the
pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way nearing midstretch. MEMORABLE ANGEL settled outside foes off the second flight racing to the turn
and failed to menace thereafter. LADY JORDAN ducked out sharply at the start while her rider immediately corrected her course, then trailed the field to the
stretch. HIFALUTIN, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset to the turn, gave way nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
PRINCESS NINA was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, continued under light reserve gaining position inside foes
racing into the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then came through inside the pacesetter to wrest the advantage under pressure
and was taken in hand once gaining a clear advantage in late stages. DONYA'S MAGIC sped to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn,
held sway on a comfortable advantage to upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner late. MUSETTA, reserved along the inside racing to the first turn,
shifted out entering the backstretch to steadily gain position between foes racing into the far turn, swung out five wide entering the lane and continued with
interest to edge a rival for a share. CHARLITA angled inwards tracking off the second flight racing to the first turn, shifted to the rail on the backstretch,
came through inside rivals gaining position in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. BEAUTIFUL TIZ, reserved in last while angling to the rail on the
first turn, saved ground throughout and steadily improved her position. BABY BEE MERRY angled inwards racing to the first turn to gain a forward placing
tracking just off the pacesetter, continued leading the second flight a bit off the rail racing into the far turn but came up empty racing into upper stretch. WILL
TAKE ROSES tracked the leader outside foes in second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to make some brief progress three wide on the far turn but
came up empty in the drive. HOPE LADY settled between foes in the last flight and offered no rally. HIGHTIME VALENTINE tracked the pacesetter between
foes in second flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded entering the far turn. RACE DAY SPEED settled outside foes in the last flight early and
proved no threat.

CHESS MASTER broke readily, was urged inside a rival disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, shifted off the inside while edging away to a clear
advantage in upper stretch and made the balance of the pace under firm handling. BABY BOOMER angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing
into the turn, continued along the rail gaining on the leaders into the stretch and edged a rival for the place honors while proving no match for the winner.
OCEANIC, urged prompting the pace outside the eventual winner, pressed the issue into upper stretch while being fanned three wide and weakened in late
stages. MIGHTY ELECTRICA ducked out at the start crossing into the paths of BEE BY THE SEA and PHASE OUT, was righted to track off the second
flight just off the inside racing into the turn, then shifted three wide in the drive while finishing evenly. HELLFIRE BOB settled along the inside racing to the
turn, shifted out to split foes just off the inside entering the stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. BEE BY THE SEA, caught in tight
quarters at the start, was held up between rivals in early stages but continued with interest to improve position between foes into the lane. DERBY CITY
broke sharply, tracked just off the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing into the turn but gave way early. PHASE OUT, caught in tight quarters start,
was held up between foes while a bit rank, swerved inwards, then ducked out sharply into the path of THAT'S BUCKBEAK nearing the turn and was fanned
five wide racing into the stretch while giving way. ED'S DOG tracked off the second flight along the inside and faded early. THAT'S BUCKBEAK was settled
outside foes in the opening stages, was forced wide nearing the turn and soon dropped out.
