Footnotes
BULL MEECHUM took control of the pace from the seven sixteenths pole and was used only as necessary to prove best. CLASSY SMITTY accelerated to a
brief early lead then gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, though, had to settle for second best. WESTBURY ESTATES came away a step slow
then picked up the chase, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened. ASK ME HOW IKNOW chased and raced in the three path most of the turn, lost
considerable ground approaching the top of the stretch and showed little further. STERLING GLADIATOR gave chase though never factored.

CHARITABLE VISIT came away a bit rank and ducked in then settled off the early pace about the three path, raced outside into the backstretch, started a
bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, threatened in the four path approaching the top of the stretch and dueled to the lead nearing the sixteenth pole,
cleared rivals past the pole and drew off. BINN GOODE hesitated at the break then angled in to race with the pace, dueled close and raced at a close
disadvantage through the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement at even terms leaving the turn but was caught nearing the sixteenth pole.
EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR hopped from the gate then saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, came
along for third under the wire and was gaining on the runner-up. FEISTY AND SASSY raced with the pace inside then inched ahead of Binn Goode from the
seven sixteenths pole, contested the rail on the far turn but was caught past the eighth pole and weakened inside the sixteenth. JOEY GOTCHA rounded
the first turn about the four path, bid leaving the three eighths pole but showed little response. FUDGE rated close to the early pace inside, picked up the
chase from the three eighths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn.

BOOM BOOM GONE rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths and widened at the rail on the far turn, extended that margin
under steady handling through the stretch but was taken in hand late. MOLLY'S GAME stalked from the two and three paths then picked up the chase
leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted toward the top of the lane and was no further factor. FLOATING BY settled off the
earlier pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole and showed little in the lane. LADY MADISON rated close inside, picked up the
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened. CORY'S CUTIE raced well back saving early ground. CATTY KRYS
rounded the turns about the four path, gave chase into the backstretch then faded past the three eighths pole.

Footnotes
HOT N SPICY LOVE stalked the earlier pace about the three path, took the lead two deep past the half mile pole and came under pressure from that point,
raced clear leaving the three eighths, widened at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled down the lane. MIDNIGHT ACT settled off the earlier pace
about the three path then saved ground into the second turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and
could only close the gap in the stretch. SOUND OFF saved early ground then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn about the three path but showed little further. AUTS REVOLUTION rated a short lead inside, came under pressure into the backstretch and gave
chase past the half mile pole, but dropped back leaving the three eighths and faded near the rail on the far turn. GIO DUDE settled off the pace about the
four path and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but was ultimately outrun. ITGOT GRANDMA raced off
the pace in the four and five paths, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but was through from that point. The mile time was unavailable.

OUT OF CENTS stalked from the three and four paths and challenged approaching the three eighths pole, took the nod toward the five sixteenths, drifted
into the stretch but dug in under steady encouragement to hold on well. PARTY LIFE rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and ceded the advantage at the five sixteenths, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn but dug in under steady encouragement to
recover second past the eighth pole and held off GOLDEN ANSWER, while the latter saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase from the three eighths
pole and briefly occupied second in the three path midway on the far turn, but was carried out toward the head of the lane and flattened stride the final
sixteenth. CHARITABLE SPENNY stalked from the three path then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the four path and
showed little more. BLACK STEEL saved early ground then bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail and had little left.

MUAD'DIB was blocked early on and angled to the four path into the first turn, raced outside entering the backstretch and improved steadily from the seven
sixteenths pole, challenged into the far turn and raced at a close disadvantage off the rail through the turn, took the lead past the eighth pole, drove clear
later yards but was mostly under a hand ride. ROCKET APPEAL rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole and
contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was caught leaving the eighth pole but continued close to mid-stretch before relenting. K TOWN BRASS
stalked from the two path then picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn, but dropped back toward the
head of the lane, though, raced evenly down the lane. SHAMELESS RISK settled just off the early pace about the three path, started a bid leaving the three
eighths pole, steadied past the five sixteenths and ran in the four path of the far turn, but showed little more. J J WEDGIT MAN saved ground off the pace
and showed little response through the backstretch.
