Footnotes
SONO GRATO five then four wide in pursuit, went five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, dug in under threat and held
safe through thick fog. I AM THE LAW three then two wide in pursuit, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to threaten to the
finish but was ultimately staved off. RUDY ROD chased four then three wide, swung four wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish to secure the
show honors. PRINCIPINO six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four to five wide through the turn and into upper stretch and offered up a mild
bid. EXALTED CHARM spurted away in hand three then two wide, swung three to four wide for home with the field making headway on his once
commanding lead, yielded the front in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths and weakened. FLYING WITH ANGELS four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the inside half a mile from home, continued along the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
HAMMERIN AAMER spotted along the rail in rapid order, was given its cue angling to the outside springing from the five-sixteenths pole, straightened away
in the neighborhood of path three a furlong later, rallied with good energy, striking the front end in midstretch, then drew off smartly. BIG MOUNTAIN got
hooked in a protracted duel with GIO D'ORO, participated in towards the two path, cleared the nemesis a short distance from the quarter pole and turned
into the lane, gave in to the winner with approximately an eighth to go, stayed on for second. I LOVE JAXSON chased the pace two wide on the turn, swung
slightly wider into the stretch, got outkicked. MINE THE COIN strung out three wide at the top of the turn, lacked the necessary response. DEEP SEA off
sluggishly, was well out in the middle of the strip on the backstretch, slid closer to the rail in time for the beginning of the run around the bend, went into the
lane having never made his presence felt. HARDCORE FOLKLORE three wide onto the turn, failed to menace. GIO D'ORO away alertly, cut over to the
inside, went at it on near even terms with BIG MOUNTAIN until the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, stepped into the stretch and readily backed
away. Dense fog obscured the viewing of the event.

Through thick fog, LOBSTA raced four then three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, dug in
under a drive and was up in the last jumps to prevail. SCHOKOLADE showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive and was caught in the last jumps to the finish. BINGO JOHN chased just off the inside until
tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home, closed well through the final furlong but
missed at the end. HORN OF PLENTY three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch, went two to three wide through the turn, spun just off the
inside for home, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. FULL MOON FEVER five paths off the inside down the backstretch, went three wide through the
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered no rally. WRITER'S REGRET chased five wide under coaxing from

Footnotes
KITH forwardly placed from the get-go, disputed the pace three wide on the turn, got called upon for more at the five-sixteenths marker, kicked well clear
from upper to midstretch, had OUR LUCKY MAN close the gap late, but held sway. OUR LUCKY MAN along the outside, pursued the pace three wide on
turn, was turned loose a few jumps shy of the quarter pole, angled one path farther off the rail for the stretch run, gained on the winner, but not enough. A
GRAY FOR CAROLYN got set up in the two path, tipped out wider for the stretch run, split rivals in midstretch, then ventured onward to earn the show.
BLACK 'N TAN argued for command from the two path, was put to a drive at the five-sixteenths pole, failed to keep pace with the top one and retreated
down the stretch. ORPHAN HALLIE angled sharply into the two path at the top of the turn, unleashed an abbreviated burst of speed at the half mile pole,
had it soon fizzle out, cut the corner into the lane and backed away. ANOTHER SHOT hung out four wide on the turn, was in path five by upper stretch,
folded.

CITY TEMPER vied three wide outside a pair coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took over command nearing the quarter pole, went five to six wide
into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to prevail. LEFT LEANING LUCY coaxed from the gate, got steadied soon after the start as GENTLE ANNIE
tucked directly in front and lost ground as a result, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, went six wide
into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors. APPLETINI vied inside a pair coming under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung
three to four wide for home, weakened in the final furlong. MEBS WEB got steadied at the start when ANYDAYISHERDAY came outwards under coaxing
shutting off her lane, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn, angled in to spin three wide into
upper stretch, improved position through to the finish. ANYDAYISHERDAY coaxed from the gate, came outwards forcing MEBS WEB to steady when taking
over her lane, then got steadied off the heels of EVAN'S NICE NOW five and a half furlongs from home as CITY TEMPER tucked over from the outside,
chased three wide, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. EVAN'S NICE NOW coaxed from the gate, vied between foes from the two path
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide for home, tired. GENTLE ANNIE tucked over just after the start forcing LEFT LEANING LUCY to
steady off her heels, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home, faltered.

Footnotes
MAKE MISCHIEF along the outside throughout, disputed the pace primarily from the three path for the opening three-quarters, grabbed away the advantage
from BABA after crossing the midway point on the turn, got driven five wide into the lane, with the runner up following suit by coming a few paths wider into
the stretch herself, had that rival take aim all the way down the lane, dug in with good determination to preserve the decision. ICE PRINCESS chased the
pace towards the four path, got called upon approaching the quarter pole, was induced to swing a couple of paths wider into the stretch, reacting to top one
moving out much wider herself, narrowed in but got staved off. ADHWAA saved ground for six furlongs, fanned out into path three from upper to midstretch,
went on to earn the show. BABA along the inside, contended for the top matched up with MAKE MISCHIEF until the general area of the five-sixteenths pole,
came into the lane and steadily backed away. IVYETSU away last after hesitating at the break, departed the backstretch from the two path, got sent out into
path four for the drive, came up empty.

Footnotes
TRAPPEZE ARTIST tracked the front runners from near the inside, swung into action by swinging four wide into the lane, closed in relentlessly, getting the
job in the shadow of the finish line. MACHO BOY sparred for control from the two path, got asked for its best after settling in upper stretch, saw the top one
closing in in a steadfast manner, relinquished reluctantly with a few jumps to spare before the wire. ALLIED INVASION gunned during the opening panel,
raced three wide onto the turn, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, venturing onward as the widest of all, was along for the show.
UNRELENTING FORCE vied for the lead from along the inside for a half, cut the corner being roused, backed away, then after suffering an apparent right
front injury just beyond the eighth pole, was vanned off. MR. FIDGET sluggish on the chute and the backstretch, was along the rail by the top of the turn,
tipped out two wide entering the stretch, launched no bids. YANKEE EMPIRE stalked the pace from the two path, got steered towards path five heading for
the top of the lane, tired. FINIS.
