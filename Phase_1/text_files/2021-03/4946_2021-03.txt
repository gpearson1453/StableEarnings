HELEN never far back, lacked a late response. ALL THE BEST was unhurried early, and was no threat. BAINBRIDGE contended early and tired on the far

Footnotes
CAUSE OF LOVE set the pace and was nicely rated on the front end, led throughout and dug in late and just lasted under strong handling. BEST OF YOU
was well placed on the inside, angled out off the rail in mid stretch, finished well and was gaining on the winner. BISCAYNE BAY contended throughout and
went evenly late. KIST allowed to settle early, rallied three wide on the far turn and drrew close, hung late. MY LITTLE LILY allowed to settle, failed to
menace. NAN'S ROSE was no factor on the insdie. SPIT'S IMAGE showed little and trailed. The rider BEST OF YOU claimed foul against the rider of
CAUSE OF LOVE for interference in mid stretch. After viewing the tape the stewards took no action.

Footnotes
SUBLIMINALCRIMINAL dueled early, shook clear in the stretch, widened late under firm handling to win going away. LONESOME PHIL was well placed on
the inside, could not challenge the winner late bu.t held place PRETTY STORMY was never far back, rallied four wide in the stretch and had a mild bid.
CATES SWOOSH raced close up until the top of the stretch and gradually weakened. MERGER OF BANKS allowed to settle, failed to menace.
ANYWHERE ROAD was no factor. IRON DRILL saved ground, and was no threat. PABLO'S QUEST raced mid pack early and tired after a half.
ALLABOUTBIZ dueled early and was through after a half.
