Footnotes
FIRE TWO POINT O back off the early pace and the inside, three wide into the turn, angled out four wide when advancing late in the bend, engaged the
leader past the furlong marker when angling in a bit, wore that foe down late under firm handling. PAPA STAR with the early pace, vied into the turn while
between rivals, dueled through the second half of the bend, larger lead when approaching the furlong grounds, responded when challenged by the winner
soon after, proved stubborn to the end. MOONSHINE MOMENT in the second flight off rail, came three wide into the stretch, shifted outside the winner
midstretch, lacked serious late punch to finish up best of the rest. GENTLE KNIGHT void of speed while just off the inside, two path into the lane, dropped to
the rail past the furlong marker, improved position. JESSE JONES with the early pace inside, vied into the turn along the rail, fell back off the leaders
midway ln the bend, continued to weaken through the stretch. ROCK CITY ROCKET set or forced the pace three wide, dueled outside the runner up late in
the turn, faltered in the drive. SPIRIT SOUL behind the pace while saving ground, was tiring when put in tight midstretch. MY KINDA TETON remained
always back while racing in the two path. CYBER SHOES off a step slow, failed to menace while saving ground throughout.

Footnotes
LOOKIN FOR EIGHT broke out, back off the pace and the inside, came three wide into the stretch, shifted out wider when straightened for home, finished
full off run to win going away down the middle of the strip in a sharp effort. SHARP ART broke well, dueled up front into the turn, shook off the other speed
to be clear late in the bend, proved no match for the winner late, remained clear for the place. KID'S MISCHIEF forwardly placed early, chased the dueling
leaders into and through the turn in the two path, went evenly through the stretch to hold the show. RECOUNT carried out by the winner to break back,
lacked early foot off the rail, three wide through the turn, staged a mild rally while not a serious threat. ALL SHACKED UP broke sharply, dueled up front
inside the runner up for a half, weakened gradually through the stretch. FIREHORN hesitated at the start to spot the field a couple of lengths, failed to
threaten. BAQUERO FLIES broke in, bumped, bothered, never menaced. SEEK N JUSTICE broke out, bumped with BAQUERO FILES, was finished early,
trailed home.

Footnotes
SUPER CONSTITUTION came out a bit early, vied between rivals through the first turn and up the backstretch, disposed of the other speed midway on the
final turn, expanded that advantage past the furlong marker, kept to task last. KID SHELLEEN in the second flight early, moved out, came three wide into
the stretch, could do little with the winner, held sway for the place. MY FAVORITE UNCLE off the pace and the inside, three wide into the far turn, asked
along, came four wide into the lane, flattened out, note enough for the place. QUALITY RUN hopped at the start to be last away, fell further back, continued
to lag second turn, displayed some modest late interest to improve position. ENID broke well, pressed the issue three wide, continued in a forward position
the middle half, had little left for the stretch run. HYPE MAN moved up inside, contested the issue inside the winner, gave way in the second turn, continued
to retreat through the lane.

Footnotes
CINCO CATALINA forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch off the inside, moved out four wide for the, turn, challenged well outside the leader turning
for home, drove steadily clear under a left handed crop. STOMPING HOTROD broke on top, cleared the opening quarter, showed the way through the turn,
offered brief resistance to the winner in upper stretch then could not keep up with that one the final furlong, enough left to last for the place. CYBER
MONDAY broke a step slow, moved out to be well wide into the turn, five wide through the bend, set down, rallied midtrack to be rapidly getting to the
runner up late. MY FORTUNATE SON settled behind the pace just off the inside, came in the two path for the drive, went evenly through the stretch in
lacking a closing response. LOU'S ARROW in the second flight early, four wide through the turn, also lacked a closing kick. RUBIGINOUS off a step slow,
raced back in trailing early, four wide exiting the turn, improved position. WARNING LABEL in the main body early, crept a bit closer from between horses
late in the turn, lacked a further response in the drive. UNBRIDLED SHOES lacked speed, raced back, four out to six wide through the turn, failed to muster
a rally. LUCKY SUSPECT saved ground, tired. DUCKTAIL was finished early.

Footnotes
CINNAMON VICTORY broke alertly, set all the pace inside while loosely rated, well clear stretch, held late under a firm hand ride. IMPLICATOR last away,
void of speed toward the inside early, four wide into the far turn, three wide into the stretch, finished willingly to be clearly second best, too late for the
winner. SIR BRAHMS behind the pace off the inside, three jwide into the far turn, dropped to the rail late in the final turn, finished up best of the rest while
not a threat to the top two. PRIVATE LAKE lacked speed off the inside, came four wide out of the final turn when moving slightly closer, flattened out to
finish up evenly the final furlong. C H JAY pressed the winner off the inside, gave way in the second turn. SUNDAY SERMON four wide into the first turn
when within striking distance, pressured the winner the middle half then backed up in the drive. JIMMIE T settled in the second flight inside, moved out
around a tiring rival late in the final turn, came up empty for the drive. TROPHY DADDY was finished before a half.

UNDECIDEDCERTAINTY outrun early while well outside, four down to three wide through the turn, switched out approaching the furlong grounds,
roused,finished with good energy to win going away. SHE'S AN ANGEL broke out, was straightened to race back and outside, four wide through the turn,
bid inside the winner past the furlong marker, no match for that one late, up for the second spot. JUST LIFE chased the issue early, remained in a forward
position while saving ground through the turn, also proved no match for the winner after briefly challenging with a furlong remaining, outkicked for the place.
LIL RESPECT within striking distance, came in the two path for the drive, lacked a closing punch. PERFECTIONTODETAIL broke sharp, quickly clear, set
the pace in the two path, faltered when headed late. UNHERDOF three wide and off the pace into the turn, worked way to the inside exiting, had little left for
the stretch run. ANOTHERINTHEFIRE one paced for a half inside, moved out in the two path exiting the bend, continued in even fashion to the wire. X
MARKS THE SPOT lacked speed off the rail, three out to four wide late in the turn, failed to rally. WICKED CHOCOLATE saved ground to no avail. OREO

Footnotes
SCARRED stalked the leader while off the inside, advanced that one in the two path second turn, dueled past the furlong marker, edged clear while a brisk
left handed crop. CAUSEWAY JONES broke on top, got clear before a quarter, showed the way up the backstretch, continued to set the pace far turn,
responded when the winner came alongside turning for home, dueled, gave ground grudgingly to that rival, clearly second best. GERSHWIN four wide when
off the early pace into the first turn, remained in midpack while three wide through the second turn, mild rally to annex the show while not a threat to the top
two. STAYIN' OUT LATE in the second flight while racing off the inside, three wide through the final turn, also had little for the top two in the drive, outkicked
for the show. SOUND THE CHARGE within striking distance along the inside, saved ground through the second turn as well, came up empty for the drive.
COUSIN LARRY off a step slow, lacked speed, four out to five wide exiting the final turn, lacked a closing response. NOTARY off the pace while inside
early, two path second turn, had nothing for the drive. LIZARD KING off slowly, was always outrun.

GUEST SUITE unhurried early while outside, three out to four wide when advancing late in the final turn, engaged the leaders with a sixteenth remaining,
proved best in a determined effort. WARRIOR'S CHARGE broke with the field, stalked the pace in hand three wide, moved on the leaders three wide late in
the final turn, showed the way past the furlong marker, failed to contain the winner to be outkicked for the win while between rivals at the wire. HOME BASE
away in good order, narrowly set the pace while in the two path, responded when challenged turning for home, proved stubborn to the ned. MY SIXTH
SENSE vied up front from the start closest to the inside, dueled the middle half, gave ground grudgingly through the stretch. MAILMAN MONEY settled off
the pace toward the inside, came up empty for the drive. FINAL JEOPARDY off a step slow, trailed throughout.

comfortably saved the show. UNBURNT off a step slow, moved out, raced five wide into the first turn,continued well wide the middle half mile, five wide into
the far turn, four wide into the lane, improved position without posing a serious threat to the top three. WESTERN ATTIRE four wide into the first turn, one
