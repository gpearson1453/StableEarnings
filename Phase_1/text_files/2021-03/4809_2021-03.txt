Footnotes
AREYOUINABAND sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task. I'M ALL MIXED UP pressed the pace, followed the winner
and was a clear second. DECADENT DIAMOND raced in the middle of the pack, came around the turn on the outside, entered the stretch wide, proved no
match for the top two, but got up for show. RAISING THE ROOF lacked early speed, made a late bid and was outfinished for third. FIERY FLASH raced
within striking distance, saved ground around the turn, made a bid and weakened down the lane. WISH FOR INTEREST lacked early speed, moved up, but
was no factor. JERRY'S LEGACY pressed the early pace and was finished early. SALT LIFE ANGEL void of early speed and was never a threat. BIGJIM'S
SILVERGAL raced near the back and showed little. AWISHFORGREELEY raced within contention and retreated to the rear.

BRITTS A CLOSER pressed the early part, raced outside around the final turn and drove clear before the wire. SMILING SONG broke out, went to the front,
drove clear, saved ground, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. DUSTY BOY came in shortly after the break, raced in the back,
showed late interest, proved no match for the top two, but got up for the show. DODGER got in tight quarters in the early part, pressed the pace and
weakened. KINLEE'S SONG squeezed, stumbled in the early going, raced in the rear and was never a threat. THE JOCKEY OF #3 KINLEE'S SONG
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #4 DODGER FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE EARLY GOING. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS ALSO CALLED
CONCERNING #5 DUSTY BOY. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #5 FROM THIRD AND PLACED HIM LAST.

for the winner. SHANGROYAL dueled for the early lead, saved ground, raced close throughout, but proved third best. TAPIZARS SECRET pressed the
early pace, saved ground around the turn and lacked a late kick. SPEEDY FELLAR void of early speed and was never a factor. VERRAZANO FIRST vied
