AUTISM SIBLINGS pressed the early pace, raced four wide through the second turn, took control at the quarter pole and drew off as an easy winner. BAD
NEWS was unhurried early, advanced six wide through the second turn, drifted in, was no match and finished second best. SOUTHERN SUMMER was void
of any early speed, raced five wide into the second turn, angled out, offered no rally and was along for third. GOLEM set a pressured early pace, raced off
the rail into both turns and weakened. WHO'S LAUGHIN NOW tracked the early pace, angled out into the stretch and never fired. SAILING FOR HOME was
allowed to settle early, was eased and vanned off.

ATTILA'S TATTLE pressed the early pace, went three wide into the turn, opened up and edged clear. SWEET SASSAFRASSY was allowed to settle early,
raced off the rail, angled in, was no match and finished second best. INDIA WILKES tracked the early pace, raced seven wide, drifted in and was empty.
BLUE LIZZY was not far back early, raced six wide into the turn, angled out and weakened. OYE COMO VA set a five wide pressured pace and faded.
KEANNA was void of speed, raced four wide into the turn, angled out through the stretch and offered no rally. PLEASE ZIP IT was unhurried early, saved
ground and was no factor.
