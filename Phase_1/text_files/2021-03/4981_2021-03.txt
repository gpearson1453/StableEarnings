speed, advanced inside on the final turn, angled wide in the stretch and rallied. THREE PHASE dropped well behind outside, moved very wide into the
stretch and finished willingly. BANKER'S ISLAND hustled to a clear advantage inside, was collared after the half and weakened. FREIBURG prompted the
pace inside, bid near the quarter pole then gave way. MR. ROMANCE trailed for three quarters then passed a fading rival. ARRIVEDERCI was taken up
inside entering the first turn, steadied soon after and stopped.
