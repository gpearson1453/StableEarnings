Footnotes
AUTS REVOLUTION sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane as
the handiest of winners. MERRY MERRY MOJO raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the first turn, raced three-wide through the third turn, could
not gain on the winner but finished well to be clearly second best. BAY HILL chased the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that foe in the
drive but came back to re-gain the show. EXECUTIVE RETREAT broke sharply to race just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the third turn
and gave way in the drive. COMPROMISO lacked early foot, saved ground through the final turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF WINDSOR was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, waited for racing room nearing the three-sixteenths
pole, slipped through with a furlong to run and drew off with complete authority. BINN GOODE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace,
came off the rail into the stretch and yielded to the winner. OWL RUN settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished
with a steady bid. CARTER'S RUN showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. SUNBRIDLED showed
brief speed from the inside and gave way. BACOLI chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. SET'EM UP JOE lacked early
foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.

BASKET GIRL was away in good order to stalk the pace of QUITE SUGGESTIVE while racing three-wide, moved up to take command inside the furlong
marker and drew clear. QUITE SUGGESTIVE was fractious in the gate, sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and yielded to the
winner through the final furlong. ELLIE BEAR settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. IRMA GIRL
lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MARYLEE showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out
with a furlong to run and did not offer a bid. AUDREY LUCILLE was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
CASTLE OF CAYLEE was away in good order to duel for the early fractions from the inside, opened a clear margin before going a half and drew off through
the lane with something left. SHE'S RIGHT chased the winner while racing four-wide throughout, was no match for that rival in the drive but finished well to
be clearly second best. KIM'S DIAMOND lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. HATTA DOUBLE showed no
early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. BUFF N settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the
second turn and failed to rally. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. QUEEN OF
ANYTHING raced off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. BELLA FEMMINA disputed the pace while racing three-wide for a half and
weakened.

Footnotes
ROYAL ATHENA pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead with a
furlong to run and was fully extended to hold off the closing GYPSY'S IMAGE by a diminishing margin. GYPSY'S IMAGE settled off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole, rallied and just missed. PACIFIC GOLD raced off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the turn and finished between rivals late to also just miss. FIFTH ILLUSION was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out
approaching the stretch and finished willingly. RAVIOLI MAMA lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the sixteenth
pole and finished with good late energy. COLETTE'S SPIRIT was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth
marker and finished with some late run. CHROMATIC set a pressured pace for the opening quarter and weakened. MNEMOSYNE was off a step slow and
lagged throughout.

Footnotes
BRIGINTINE ISLAND dueled for the lead with MALIBU SPLASH while racing three-wide, disposed of that rival after going a half, was quickly taken on by
POWER FORWARD and gamely held that rival at bay through a prolonged drive. POWER FORWARD stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved
up to a striking position nearing the three-sixteenths pole but could not get by the winner in the drive. MALIBU SPLASH was away in good order to dispute
the pace with the winner from the inside and gave way after going a half. OCEAN LILLY was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second
turn and lacked the needed closing response. CAMERON STREET showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn and was not a factor.
LIES AND SCANDALS lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not reach contention.

STRONG HEART was off slow, raced unhurried while never far back, moved three-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive
and caught REMYS SHOWTIME in the closing yards. REMYS SHOWTIME sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, remained in control
through mid-stretch and appeared to tire late. NAUTICAL WARRIOR broke sharply to chase REMYS SHOWTIME while racing three-wide and gave way
after going a half. RUCKER lagged throughout and was eased late.

Footnotes
MEGA MILLIONS stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up in tandem with THE EXCEPTION to offer a bid nearing the quarter and drew off
through the lane with authority. THE EXCEPTION settled off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid with the winner nearing the quarter but
could not match strides with that rival in the drive. DESTINY'S CHARGE raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and
finished with a steady bid. CREATIVE MINESHAFT raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive.
STROLLANOTHERTIME lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not menace. GOOFY BOY showed no early speed, raced
three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. FOREFRONT was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not offer
a bid. MUSTA NEVER MET U sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and weakened after going five furlongs. STONE CRAZED broke
sharply to chase the leader from the inside and weakened after going three furlongs.
