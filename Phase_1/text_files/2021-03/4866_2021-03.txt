DRUNKEN LOVE well placed along the inside for a half, shifted out to the three path entering the stretch, inherited the lead before the furlong marker then
finished full of run under a hand ride to win going away. HURRICANE NATION unhurried early, rallied two wide through upper stretch and finished second
best. BLOWBACK chased the pace into the stretch, offered a mild bid in the four path then leveled off. A PENN LEGACY passed tiring rivals.
SKINNERSBURG was no factor. HAPPILEA stumbled a few strides out of the gate and was through after a half. DIAMOND PATRIOT sprinted to a daylight
lead soon after the start, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was used up.

Footnotes
EKATI CHAMPAGNE dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch, shook clear when set down before the furlong marker and finished full of run
under a hand ride to win going away. JENNSTONE stalked the early pace, loomed boldly three wide midway on the turn then was no match for winner while
clearly second best. KING OF LIGHT settled inside, swung wide entering the stretch and passed tiring rivals. MAGIC TRAIN stalked the early pace near the
inside and faded on the turn. CHOCOLATE SOLDIER was no factor. FATTERTHANME battled with the winner two wide into the turn then gave way in the
final furlong. POWER IMAGE was in tight along the rail causing his rider to check at the nine sixteenths pole then was no threat. PUTIN MY TWO CENTS
had brief speed. MR. MAKOO flashed speed two wide and stopped on the turn.

FLAT DISCOUNT was hustled up to make the lead along the inside before a quarter, set all the pace and finished full of run under brisk handling to win as
much the best. ROMANTIC JEWEL chased the winner into the stretch, drifted to the five path when struck with a left handed whip in mid stretch and
finished second best. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL had speed from the start, offered a mild bid along the inside into the stretch then leveled off. CUTIE PIE went
evenly. FRANKIE'S GIFT failed to menace. PRECIOUS ARCH had brief speed. LIVE IT UP was through early.

Footnotes
STARTDFROMDABOTTOM prompted the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch to win
as much the best while being ridden out. KISSINGER unhurried early, closed willingly four wide through the stretch and finished second best. BISCUITS
AND GRITS stalked the pace for a half, offered a mild bid two wide into the stretch then leveled off. TAPSHOT slow early, swung wide and had a mild late
rally in the six path. QUALITY MAN stalked the pace from the inside and faded in the stretch. NEVUS failed to menace. BODYGUARD with the second flight
three wide, weakened in the stretch. IT'S A MANS WORLD was no factor. HOME RUN POWER away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the turn, had
speed into the stretch then flattened out. THE MAN CAN trailed.
