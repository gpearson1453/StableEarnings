Footnotes
QUICKER was sent to a clear lead soon after the break, stayed out from the inside and held under urging. A MAIZE ZING RIP broke slowly, lagged along
the rail into the stretch then finished fast. DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT chased in the three path, moved closer in early stretch then flattened out. ATLANTIC
CHILL was slow early, stayed close to the inside and lacked a strong closing. FROST'S SONG fell back outside early, raced the three path around the turn
and tired. OBROTHER ITSYLVIA fell back along the rail on the turn, swung out entering the stretch and stopped.

leader into the turn, fell back and outfinished tired ones. HEADED FOR HEAVEN raced between rivals and tired. IL MIO AMORE chased three wide for
about a half and stopped in the lane. CASEYOUDIDN'TKNOW was slow early, made a five wide run around the turn then stopped. GROTON ST SCOUT

Footnotes
BRAZILIAN BAY showed speed outside from the start, moved two wide to a clear lead into the turn, remained clear into deep stretch and lasted. NEARLY
MISSED was unhurried early, rallied the three path around the turn then closed a gap from the outside through the final yards. FOXY HIYA was reluctant to
load, gained early position inside, came out into the three path while moving on the turn then lacked the needed late response as the rider dropped his whip
nearing the finish. EXPRESSFUL GRACE dueled inside the winner to the end of the backstretch then faded. LIL SURVIVOR was slow early, stayed inside
and continued evenly. NORMANS GIRL GAYLE was outrun inside. SOLO TRY broke slowly and lagged early. TARA'S Z VA was finished early. CELTIC
RING was outrun.

BLUEGRASS POSSE settled, raced two wide around the turn, dueled outside through the final sixteenth and prevailed. MR. SKITTLES rallied inside the
winner around the turn and through the lane but wasn't enough. DIAL ONE opened a clear lead from the outside before going a furlong, stayed out from the
rail around the turn and faded from between the top two. VOUCH was unhurried, raced wide around the turn and into the stretch then finished willingly
outside. SAN ELIJO stayed along the rail and found best stride too late. STORM TALES was outrun. INCENSED was caught in tight between horses on the
backstretch and into the turn. TWICEASLUCKY briefly showed speed.

Footnotes
BRAHMS BREEZE showed speed in the two path and drove clear through the lane. PATAZ threw his head down and to the inside just as the doors opened,
was forced in leaving the gate, moved quickly between horses to press outside the winner but weakened late. LOVE THAT JAZZ ducked in sharply leaving
the gate, advanced between horses early, came out into the three path while not far back on the turn, lugged in sharply in early stretch, impeded BROTHER
TEZ then gained slowly. Following objections by Conner and Albright, LOVE THAT JAZZ was disqualified and placed fifth. BROTHER TEZ was slow early,
raced two wide around the turn, steadied, came over on MAGICIAN'SCALENDAR in early stretch then finished willingly. MAGICIAN'SCALENDAR was slow
early, stayed along the rail, steadied in early stretch then continued willingly. LUMBERER was outrun. CHEESE ON wasn't far back outside early, raced the
three path around the turn, faded through the lane and was eased up late.

wasn't far back along the inside for about five furlongs then stopped. PAINT IT GREEN stopped two wide. WICKED T lagged badly and found best stride
way too late. SHEESA PONTIAC stopped. PENNY IN LOVE pressed outside the winner for about five furlongs then stopped.

Footnotes
SARATOGA WILDCAT wasn't far back outside, was forced wide around the turn, dueled outside through the lane, lugged in late under right hand whip,
bumped late with VINNY BOY and prevailed. VINNY BOY made the early place inside horses while bearing out far into the track, remained wide around the
turn, dueled through the lane, sharply bore out late under left hand whip, impeded CONQUEST PRANKSTER and bumped with the winner just before the
finish. Following an objection by Wolfsont, VINNY BOY was disqualified and placed fourth. CLEAR PROSPERITY settled, was sent to vie along the rail into
the final furlong but wasn't enough. CONQUEST PRANKSTER was brushed and carried far out into the track while pressing outside the early leader, moved
to a short lead while wide on the turn, continued to duel between horses through the lane and was checked late when shut off between the top two finishers.
An objection by Woflsont against the winner was not allowed. NO HITTER tired. CHUNNEL fell far back early and couldn't catch up.
