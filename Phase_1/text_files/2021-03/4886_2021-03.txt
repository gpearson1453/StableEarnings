came around the turn four wide, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. MIDNIGHT TRIP bumped start, raced in the back of
the pack in the beginning, made a steady gain, came around the turn four wide and was outfinished for second. SCAMPERING GRAYCE challenged for the
early lead, weakened and was no threat late. ENDURING PEACE vied for the early lead, saved ground and faded. BUILDING HOME lacked early speed,
raced wide around the turn and was never a threat. FORT PIKE bumped at the start, raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
HOLY SONG sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task. LA GATA MALA raced in the back in the beginning, moved up,
pressed the pace and was a clear second at the wire. PRUD AS PUNCH raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the second turn, proved no
match for the top two, but got up for third. CLOCKED IN TYME lacked early speed, made a late rail bid and missed third. WILL B LATE hopped at the start,
racing from the back, gained ground, but was no factor. MISS INVADER pressed the pace, faded and was no threat late. ENOUGH HEART was an early
factor and made a steady retreat. SALESGIRL lacked early speed, raced outside around the second turn and showed little. SIBERIANPRODUCTION
always raced near the back, came around the final turn wide and was never a threat. ALYS EPISODE challenged for the early lead and stopped.

SWANEE BEACH stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up on the outside around the final turn, took command entering the stretch, pulled clear and
won under steady urging. CRIDER CHASE vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, couldn't match strides late with the winner, but held
on for place. TOSHITA FOREVER lacked early speed, made a steady gain and was outfinished for second. CABO SUNSET dueled for the early lead,
saved ground, weakened and finished evenly. AD LIBITUM raced in the back of the pack, came around the final turn wide, improved position, but was no
factor. CLEVER ARCH vied for the early lead and was finished early. CLOUDYWITHACHANCE lacked early speed, raced wide around the second turn and
was never a threat. IDAREELDEAL raced near the middle of the field and dropped back.

Footnotes
KING COOKIE vied for the early advantage, took command around the turn, dueled down the stretch with D'ROCK and drove clear before the wire.
D'ROCK challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, dueled down the stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others.
SHANGHAI MIKE raced within striking distance, made a bid and followed the top two to the wire. CURTIN'S UP raced within contention, lacked a late kick
and was outfinished for third. ETERNAL FORCE lacked early speed, came around the turn wide, showed late interest, but was no factor. FLASH ME BACK
void of early speed and passed tired ones. BAPTISM pressed the early pace, saved ground around the turn and faded. ICE PEAK void of early speed and
showed little. SMARTY GRIMES always raced near the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
ARCHIE unhurried in the early going, moved up between rivals around the second turn, rallied down the stretch and was going away at the end. MR.
BANDINI'S BAND pressed the pace, saved ground around the final turn, proved no match late for the winner, but was best of rest. VICTOR LOUNGE (IRE)
raced within contention, was close throughout, made a mild bid and was a clear third. NASTIDA MAST lacked early speed, made a steady gain, but was no
factor. APALACHEE BAY went to the front, drove clear, entered the home stretch wide and was finished early. QUALITY PRODUCTION pressed the early
pace and faded down the stretch. PERFECT PARADE raced evenly near the back and was no threat. SPRING RODEO void of early speed and showed
little. LITTLE TOE raced near the back, lacked a bid and was outrun. ACTIF ONE raced in the middle of the field and dropped back. Due to a timer
