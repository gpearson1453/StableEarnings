for show. KEEPME IN THEGAME lagged back inside to the half, rallied to just miss the show spot late. ALEMIA pressed pace from two path, dueled out of

BELUSHI SAMURAI quick to the front outside, set all pace while well handled to wire. OAK ROOM well placed while never far back, took up chase but
proved no match for the winner. DO YOUR BEST raced back to far turn with a rail run for the show spot. BOAT WAMPUM no speed to far turn, wide run
into the stretch and moved up late. ANIMAL KRACKERS raced evenly with no late response when needed. ONDALOVE (FR) no speed to far turn, improved
position only in the stretch run. PITMAN VALLEY up close to far turn between horses but weakened in the stretch. CHEROKEE HAWK steadied along out of
first turn, never a menace. KOBE BEACH in tight out of first turn, gave way after the half. S S SMARTY inside early, dropped far back. CREASY chased
pace to half between horses, gave way readily.
