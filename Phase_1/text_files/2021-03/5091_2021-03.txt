Footnotes
REINSURE away in good order, pace inside, vied the middle half along the inside, two path into the lane when continuing to contest the issue into the lane,
headed midstretch, battled back inside of that rival to be clear at the wire. HEROIC SONG pushed in at the start, angled in to save some ground first turn,
ranged up and loomed boldly five wide turning for home, put a head in front nearing the furlong grounds, outkicked in the late going. BEAUCETTE'S EKATI
with the pace while between foes early, held a narrow advantage backstretch, continued to vie through the final turn, weakened in the final furlong, saved
the show. BEAU BOOK last to leave, trailed early inside, moved out and raced three wide into the lane when improving, continued to close ground to finish
up willingly while too late for the show. KING OF THE RING forwardly placed outside into the first turn, stalked the issue while remaining outside in the run
up the backstretch, crept a bit closer through the final turn then came up empty for the drive. WHEREVER HE IS tracked the pace while saving ground,
moved closer along the rail turning for home then flattened out in the drive. MAJESTIC DAY broke to the inside bothering inner rivals, was bothered and
pushed out into the first turn when MORA bore out, remained back in failing to threaten. MR. PETERKIN bothered, steadied when pushed out six wide into
the first turn, improved slightly the middle half then had little left for the drive. FACTION with the early pace while between horses, stopped far turn, jogged
in. MORA bothered start, bore out first turn, fell far back, pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
CHICORY BLUE broke in slightly, in some traffic when in the second flight into the first turn, moved out a bit and advanced three wide to challenge through
the second bend, floated out a bit upper stretch, extended drive, proved best in a determined effort. HYNDFORD broke on top, showed the way through the
first turn inside, continued to set the pace the middle four furlongs, responded when the winner came alongside turning into the stretch while racing in the
two path, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, proved stubborn to the end. GIGGING back off the pace, continued in the main body while off the inside
backstretch, four wide through much of the second turn when advancing, steered inside the two leaders nearing the furlong grounds, finished up willingly to
be slowly getting to the runner up late. AQUALITYINDIVIDUAL in some traffic into the first turn, pulled firmly onto the backstretch, was covered up into the
far turn, saved ground into the lane, went evenly to the wire. ALTITO off a step slow, trailed early, came four wide out of the final turn, improved position with
some mild late interest. ALWAYS A CATCH settled off the pace and the inside, closer middle half, weakened in the drive. GOSPEL ABE off a step slow,
moved out to be four wide when moving a bit closer late in the first turn, continued out in the strip, came five wide into the lane, made little impact to the
wire. WICKETS WAY pressed early, began a steady retreat after a half.

inside, steered out in the two path midway on the turn, shifted out wide for the drive, displayed some moderate late interest to be up for the show.
HAPPYLIFE last away, trailed early, saved ground into the lane, moved out around a tiring rival midstretch, improved slightly, no real threat. GRAVITRON
forwardly placed off the inside, three wide out of the turn, tired a bit in the drive. POLYESTER BRIDE broke with the leaders, cleared to the inside, pace,

Footnotes
LINE OF FAITH back off the pace early, advanced along the inside to improve through the turn, steered out widest for the drive, challenged while out in the
middle of the strip past the furlong marker, proved best under firm handling. SAILAWAY AND HIDE also void of speed, followed the winner along the inside
through the turn, unlike that one, remained on the rail through the stretch, got through a narrow opening inside the furlong grounds, finished with good
courage to prove second best. THIS GIRL DOES vied up front three wide, challenged in the turn, narrowly showed the way past the furlong maker, could
not match strides with the top two late, gained the nod for the show. EMERALDS R US with the pace from the start inside, continued to contest the issue
into the lane, slight drift then allowed the runner up the inside with less than a furlong remaining, weakened a bit, lost the nod for the show. DENALI
ROCKET narrowly set the pace while between rivals into and through the turn, continued to battle midstretch, also narrowly lost the show late. CYBER
AFFAIR off slowly to spot the field a couple of lengths, two path through the turn when improving, failed to sustain that advance through the stretch.
MARILYN'S MAGIC off a step slow, dropped toward the inside, turn, made little impact through the stretch. FRANKIES MOONSHINE in mid pack outside,
four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally in the drive. O. K. SOCKS in mid pack off the inside, rank, gave way midway on the turn, well back.
TUESDAY behind the first flight well out in the strip, gave way while four out to five wide turning for home, jogged in.

Footnotes
ZANSHOES forwardly placed from the start outside, advanced four wide midway on the turn, challenged in the three path into the lane, showed the way
past the furlong marker, dug in late to hold the next two safe in the final strides. LOVELY LOU broke b ack, lacked early foot, came in the two path when
beginning to advance into the stretch, switched to the outside nearing midstretch, finished willingly to gain the place late, getting to the winner quickly at the
wire. EURO ME back off the pace toward the inside, advanced and then steered out to reach contention under some clever handling into the stretch,
challenged briefly outside the winner nearing the furlong grounds, flattened in the late going to lose the place spot. FLORIDA BIRD last to leave, asked
along midway on the turn, angled out to be five wide exiting the bend, improved position well out in the strip while too late. MANY SWEET TREATS settled
off the pace and the inside, three path through the turn, continued one paced through the lane in lacking a closing kick. TAILORBESWIFT broke alertly, set
or forced the pace three wide, faltered in the drive. FIVE QUEENS lacked speed outside, was floated out to be six wide into the stretch, failed to muster a
rally. TRIPLE HAPPY vied up front along the inside for four furlongs then faltered in the drive. TIDDLY flashed brief speed while between horses and
stopped in the turn.

Footnotes
ELITCH pinched back to trail just after the start, dropped inside to save some ground first turn, continued inside, moved out into the two path midway on the
second turn, dropped back to the rail while in traffic into the lane, moved out for the drive, closed resolutely to prove best. OFF SIXES back off the pace
toward the inside, advanced and challenged outside the leader second turn, took over, clear when straightened for home, could not contain the winner,
narrowly lasted for the place. TASHKENT in the second flight while off the inside, closer in some traffic entering the stretch, shifted out, willingly late to miss
the place. BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS settled behind the pace toward the inside, asked along second turn, moved out a bit to the two path into lane, late traffic,
steered in final strides. DEALIN' STELEN lacked speed while four wide into the first turn, continued outside, four wide again in the second bend, went evenly
for the drive. STREET TO INDY off the pace while racing four wide, continued within striking distance far turn, also was found lacking for the drive. IKE took
command after the start, continued to show the way up the backstretch, weakened when headed by the runner up late in the final turn. NEVER EVEN
CALLED remained back in failing to threaten. GHOSTLY WHO pressed the early leader on the outside, got out a bit first turn, continued to force the issue
the middle half then gave way in the drive.

RED AGAIN pressed or set a soft set of fractions, put a head in front before a half, narrowly showed the way through the second turn, headed a furlong out,
long drive between rivals, regained the advantage late to prevail in game fashion. ARRIVAL showed the way into the first turn along the inside, helped set
the leisurely early fractions, put a head back in front with a furlong remaining, outfinished in the late going to miss. RIVER ECHO (GB) lacked early foot
toward the inside, steered out to be three wide turning for home, set down, finished willingly to be getting to the top two late. HOP KAT in the second flight
just off the inside, ranged up to challenge in bold fashion three wide in the second turn, long drive to the wire, hung late. LORD DRAGON back off the pace
and the inside, raced four out to five wide turning for home, improved a bit with some modest late interest. SHORTLIST lacked early foot, trailed early, crept
closer along the inside turning for home, failed to sustain that advance through the stretch. CHARLIE'SARCHANGEL in the second flight outside, four wide
second turn, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
FRENCH EMPIRE behind the pace toward the inside, briefly waited in some traffic turning for home, split foes past the furlong marker, gained the
advantage soon after, slight drift, kept to pressure. HEADLAND stalked the dueling leaders into the turn in the three path, ranged up to challenge exiting the
turn, dueled with the winner inside the furlong marker, could not match that one late, remained clear for the place. SHESOMAJESTIC dueled up front off the
inside, put a head in front turning into the lane, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, could not match the top two late, remained clear of the
others. BEST KEPT SECRET last away, raced back and outside, came four wide into the lane, picked off a tiring rival while never a threat. MUCHO AMOR
fell back to trail after the start, was never a threat. SUNNY DALE away in good order, narrowly set the pace along the inside, headed turning for home,
steadily backed up.

WILLOW MOON broke sharp, quickly sprinted clear through a rapid opening quarter, continued to maintain daylight into the lane, turned back a rival inside
the furlong marker, enough left to hold off the runner up. HISSY MISSY lacked speed, saved ground through the turn, set down for the drive and rallied up
the rail to be getting to the winner late. OOCHIE settled in the two path, roused for the drive, closed some ground on the top two late while gaining the nod
for the show spot. LADY ASTRID void of speed while racing outside, four wide through the turn, lugged in upper stretch, staged a late rally through traffic to
narrowly miss the show. HEATED ARGUMENT prompted the winner while racing off the inside, tried the winner from the outside past the furlong marker,
faltered in the late going. SUPERSTAR BEA broke in, was straightened to race back off the pace, traffic upper stretch, finished up evenly when clear.
PRESLEY in mid pack while racing outside, four wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. JOY IN THE JOURNEY forwardly placed for a half in the three
path, also came up empty for the drive.
