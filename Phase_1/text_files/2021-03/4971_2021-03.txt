Footnotes
PIRATES CROSS stalked the early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, found room, took control at the eighth pole and held for the win. MY FIRST PEARL
was void of speed, went four wide into the turn, angled in, was gaining late and finished second best. TIZ TENACIOUS raced in mid pack early, went six
wide through the turn, was forced out in early stretch, raced nine wide and was along for third. MALIBU MISTRESS tracked the early pace, went five wide
into the turn, was forced out seven wide out of the turn and offered a mild late rally. SMOOTH RITHMS set a pressured early pace, went four wide into the
turn, drifted out through the turn and weakened. ELDORADO DREAM was allowed to settle early, raced seven wide through the turn, angled towards the
inside and finished belatedly. LINE CALL was taken back early, circled eight wide through the turn, angled in and never fired. SACAGEWEA pressed the
early pace, went three wide and faded.

prevailed for the win. APPEARTOTRUST was void of any early speed, circled eight wide through the second turn, was closing late, drifted in and needed
more. SHAKE IT CALI was unhurried early, raced along the inside into the home turn and was gaining late. TEQUILA DIVA tracked the early pace, went five
wide through the second turn, made a bid on the winner, dueled to late stretch and weakened late. VONHRA was taken back early, advanced seven wide
