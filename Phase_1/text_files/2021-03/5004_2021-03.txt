AUBURN MILL was hustled along to set a pressured pace off the rail and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. MINDYOURPSANDQS gave
chase well off the rail, rounded the turn three and four wide then dug in to take second late while gaining on the winner. OFFICER UNBRIDLED pressured
the early pace inside, raced at the rail on the turn and finished evenly. ADDY'S LOVE pressured the pace three wide, remained a close factor through the
turn but dropped back inside the eighth pole and flattened stride the final sixteenth. MR. SNAP gave chase and rounded the turn in the five path.

lead leaving the eighth pole, raced clear in the upper stretch and held well with steady encouragement. STERLINGS MORENA saved ground well off the

ran three wide on the far turn but flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the
seven sixteenths pole and drew clear past the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail, was caught just inside the furlong pole and weakened. BELLA

RUN FAR stalked from the two and three paths then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled to even terms approaching the top of the
stretch and dug in determinedly to edge out the game effort of GREY INVASION, who took the lead three wide into the first turn and rated the pace, came
under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was headed nearing the top of the stretch and dug in gamely before relenting late yards. POLITICAL
DECISION rated close inside the first turn then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, came through the far turn three wide and dug in to take third the
final yards. MALIBU CIRCLE raced with the pace inside through the front stretch but dropped back at the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase down the
backstretch, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened stride. BURN THE SHIPS rounded the first turn in the four path then stalked into the
backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but dropped back at the rail approaching the quarter and faded at the rail on the far turn.
NTH POWER was not a factor. DUNLUCE CAISSLE raced off the pace in the three and four paths and never factored.

the turn about the four path, drifted into the stretch and raced evenly to the late going before flattening stride. THAT'S HISTORY gave chase and faded in
the three path of the turn. SLEEPING GIANT rounded the turn off the rail and weakened.

DAZZLE ME raced off the pace and off the rail the first turn, started a bid into the far turn and angled five wide through the turn, then dug in at the head of
the lane to get up the final strides. MALIBU SPLASH settled off the earlier pace while saving ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the
far turn at the rail, took the lead in the upper stretch, raced briefly clear late yards but was caught in the final strides. STOWE ANGEL came through the first
turn about the three path and stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn four wide and closed to
late stretch before flattening late yards. OUR DIAMOND GIRL rated a short lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole and contested
the edge through the far turn, was caught in the upper stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. SHE GIVES ME FITS stalked from the two and three paths
then challenged leaving the three eighths pole, raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn then weakened inside the sixteenth pole. YOUR
EYES TO MINE rounded the first turn about the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole,
entered the far turn still in the four path, angled in nearing the head of the lane but showed little more.

chase toward the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, though, had to settle for second. OCEAN LILLY settled off the pace toward the
inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn just off the rail, angled to the four path approaching the head of the lane but showed little
further. DUBAI WAS LIT saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, though had little left. LIES AND
SCANDALS raced off the pace in the three path the opening turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, remained in the three path of the far turn
then weakened.

Footnotes
PISTOL P stalked two deep the opening turn then challenged from the seven sixteenths pole, dueled to the front just inside the quarter, raced clear midway
on the far turn, drifted into the stretch but dueled clear a sixteenth away and was steadily handled to widen. NOID settled back in the three and four paths
the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five and six paths and steadily improved to
take second the final strides. IN THE GOSPEL rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and was caught past the
quarter, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn then flattened through the lane. C R'S MANDATE settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the three
eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then flattened stride the final sixteenth. CHOCO ROCO raced off the pace about the four path the first
turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and improved in the three path of the far turn, but showed little more in the lane. STRIDE ON BY rated off the
earlier pace about the three path, picked up the chase into the backstretch, raced at the rail on the far turn though showed little more. BLUE COLLAR BOY
was reluctant to load and broke a step slow, raced in the six path the first turn, entered the backstretch outside and bid toward the three eighths pole, but
flattened in the five path of the far turn. MADDEYE MOODY rounded the opening turn about the three path and stalked into the backstretch, gave chase
from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the four and five paths of the far turn. CAYATANO raced well off the early pace toward the inside and was
not a factor. JACKSON MAN rounded the first turn in the five path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, faded past the five sixteenths,
showed no further response and was eased in the stretch.
