WINE AT NINE chased the early pace, went four wide into the second turn, took control at the eighth pole and edged clear for the win. PLAYOFF BOUND
tracked the early pace, angled out through the stretch, was no match and finished second best. MON CAMO set a clear early pace, raced off the rail in both
turns, opened up, drifted out and weakened. ALL UNDER CONTROL was allowed to settle early, went six wide out of the second turn and offered no late
rally. COLONEL GOTHAM stalked the early pace from the inside and was empty. MOST DETERMINED was void of speed, went three wide into the second
turn, angled out late stretch and finished belatedly. WINGS OF THE WIND was unhurried and was no factor.

unhurried early, went five wide into the second turn, angled out seven wide through the stretch, offered no rally and was along for third. CLAVICHORD was

Footnotes
POCO SUENOS was taken back early, raced along the inside into the home turn, was closing though the turn, waited for room, found room, dueled with
DRAFTY BREEZE and prevailed for the win. DRAFTY BREEZE was reserved early, advanced five wide through the second turn, was gaining late, matched
strides with the winner and finished second best. BOLD REY was allowed to settle early, loomed four wide into the second turn, flattened out and held for
third. DANSMETOTHENDOFLOV was unhurried early, went seven wide into the second turn and offered no rally. DELIGHTFUL HIPS set a clear early pace
from the inside and gave way. MY EXPRESSION chased the early pace, went three wide into the second turn and faded. HONOURAPRILSRULES no
speed and was no factor.
