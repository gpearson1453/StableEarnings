Footnotes
TANGLED WEB broke readily, went well clear of the field racing to the turn, then held sway on a widening margin while being kept to the task. MALIO'S
angled inwards to track the pacesetter between foes from out of striking distance racing to the turn and proved best of the others in the drive while no threat
to the winner. ROLLER, slow into stride, shifted off the inside racing behind the second flight, then split foes three wide racing into upper stretch to gain
some position. PAINTER'S PRIDE tracked the leader four wide in second flight in early stages and steadily faded racing into the turn. MULLED WINE
angled to the inside tracking the leaders in second flight and steadily faded nearing the lane. THE GREAT LOUDINI dropped out early.

Footnotes
SAPPHIRE JUBILEE broke sharply, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace, turned back a challenge from HOLY DIVER racing into upper stretch and
went clear under steady pressure. The latter was urged to terms with the eventual winner forcing the pace to the backstretch, then into the far turn striking
the front between calls, pressed that foe to upper stretch but proved no match while prevailing for second. CROWN OF JOY settled outside foes in the last
flight, was prompted to gain position three deep between foes racing into the far turn but finished evenly late. REINA LA KELSY angled to the inside in early
stages while settling in last, was steadied along the rail avoiding close quarters nearing the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid.
PAYNTER FEST, urged to a forward placing three deep between foes racing just off the first flight to the backstretch, faded between foes into upper stretch.
ALEXBABE, caught four wide into the first turn while prompted to a position just off the leaders, continued in that path into the far turn and gave way into the
lane. ROSALDA tracked off the first flight just off the inside between foes racing to the backstretch but faded after a half.

Footnotes
PLATINUMCENTS was urged to dictate the pace a bit off the rail opening a comfortable margin racing to the backstretch, turned back foes racing through
the far turn and regained a clear advantage under firm handling to prove best. SUNNYMEDE DREAM, forwardly placed tracking just outside the pacesetter
to the first turn, angled inside entering the backstretch, shifted out nearing midstretch and narrowly prevailed for the place honors between foes while failing
to gain even terms with the winner. MOMS LOVE settled between foes in early stages, was prompted to advance while angling inside entering the stretch
and was just outkicked for second. GET BACK HOME, reserved in early stages, was prompted to advance racing three wide, then four wide into upper
stretch but lacked the needed final kick. HEPZIBAH, urged to a forward placing racing just outside the leader in the opening half, closed the gap on that foe
to lodge a brief bid midway through the far turn but flattened out leaving midstretch. INHONOROFOWENJR, held up near the inside in early stages, failed to
menace thereafter. DREAMER'S GETAWAY tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening stages, shifted in to make brief progress between
rivals nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. ENOUGH KISSES tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the far turn and
gave way nearing the lane. WRAPPING tracked off the second flight along the inside, steadily faded after a half and was vanned off the course following the
race.

Footnotes
TRUE ATKA switched a bit off the inside tracking off the first flight racing through the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the turn commencing a steady
advance, bid for command inside foes nearing midstretch and went clear late under firm right handed encouragement. BETTERTHENYOURX, forwardly
placed three deep in the opening stages prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue outside a rival into upper stretch but proved only second best.
EFFIEMEISTER settled off the second flight racing to the turn, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch, and continued with interest to prevail for a share.
TEA PARTY was urged inside foes disputing the pace racing through the backstretch, dueled for command racing a bit off the rail to upper stretch but gave
out once headed by the winner. LOVIELEE, in touch with the first flight between foes in the opening stages, was held up dropping off the first flight racing to
the turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch and steadily faded. PURPLE SCOOTER made brief pursuit of the leaders three wide early but steadily
faded racing into the turn. RETURN THE FAVOR proved no factor.

Footnotes
TOP BOMB was rated off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted four wide while being prompted to advance racing into the far turn, swung wide
entering the stretch but continued with solid momentum to wrest the advantage and go clear under firm encouragement. RAL COPPERHEADROAD angled
inwards while being rated off the second flight racing to the backstretch, split rivals just off the inside racing into the stretch and narrowly prevailed for the
place honors late. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE, forwardly placed along the rail to attend a rival's pace racing into the backstretch, bid for command entering
upper stretch to lead between calls but weakened leaving midstretch. GIOVANE'S PROMISE tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the first
turn, shifted out three wide after a half, was urged to lodge a brief bid between foes in that path nearing the lane but had no final bid. BEACH BANDIT
settled last along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch gaining some position inside foes but had no closing bid. DEVILISH THOUGHTS was urged
forcing the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, gained the advantage to set the pace off the rail racing to the far turn and gave out between foes
into the lane. BIG POLO tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening half, was prompted to make a brief advance nearing upper stretch but soon
emptied out. OUR GREY GHOST settled into stride a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch but failed to menace thereafter. NEW SOUTH, caught four
wide racing into the first turn tracking the leaders outside foes as part of the second flight, faded early. NEW ACCOUNT angled to the inside racing to the
first turn and retreated early.

ROCK THE PARK, broke out bumping NICOLE MUNNINGS at the start, was rated between foes in the last flight to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the
far turn while commencing a steady four wide advance and produced a sustained response to prevail in time under firm encouragement. MY COWBOY was
urged to gain the lead outside a rival racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a clear margin off the rail to the far turn, then to upper stretch, resisted the
winner to late stages but was collared nearing the wire. FOURTH DESIGN tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing to the backstretch,
continued with a steady bid into the far turn to upper stretch but couldn't match terms with the top pair late. CAMPAIGN SPY tracked off the second flight
outside foes racing to the backstretch, shifted inwards nearing the lane but couldn't produce a closing bid. NICOLE MUNNINGS, bumped at the start, was
righted to track just off the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded entering the far turn. DISCREET HEAT settled
inside foes in the last flight early and never gained contention. PRIZED WARRIOR, urged to prompt the pace along the inside from the outset racing to the
backstretch, steadily faded after a half.

Footnotes
KING ANDRES tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, advanced in close quarters to bid for command nearest the rail
leaving the midway point of the far turn, went clear into upper stretch and held RED SORRELL to the end under firm handling. The latter was settled outside
foes racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into the far turn steadily gaining position nearing upper stretch, tipped outside the winner and
continued willingly to late stages to close the gap. STUNNING BABY, pulling a bit in early stages while prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch,
shifted outside the pacesetter nearing the far turn to bid for command three wide between foes approaching upper stretch, couldn't match terms with the top
pair in the closing stages but continued with a grudging effort between foes to prevail for a share. LUCKY MIKE tracked off the second flight along the
inside, saved ground through the far turn to upper stretch and was just outkicked for a share. VIOLATOR, forwardly placed three wide racing to the
backstretch tracking just off the leaders, was urged to challenge four wide nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. FEISTY KITTEN settled out of striking
distance along the inside and failed to mount a serious challenge. IGOTSUNSHINE settled between foes racing to the backstretch and never proved a
serious threat. FIREBALL RUN broke sharply, angled inwards setting the pace just off the rail racing to the backstretch, dueled between foes into the far
turn and gave way abruptly entering upper stretch. TIZ LUNA hopped at the start while breaking slowly and trailed throughout. DONEGAL ACES WAS A
LATE SCRATCH AFTER DISLODGING HIS RIDER IN THE POST PARADE AND RUNNING LOOSE ON THE COURSE.

Footnotes
SMOKIN CLASS, urged to the lead along the inside in the opening sixteenth, lost the advantage after the opening furlong, switched outside the pacesetter
racing into the turn while being prompted to make a steady advance, took over nearing midstretch and widened the advantage in a ridden out effort. LIL
ANNIE ROSE was hustled to the lead outside foes, angled to the rail once gaining the advantage racing into the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch
but proved no match while just lasting for second. MAGIC SOLUTION tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening stages, split rivals entering
the turn, angled four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest while just missing for second. DIAMOND SLEW broke outwards bumping
CRYSTAL SKY, was righted to gain a forward placing three deep between foes tracking just off the leaders racing into the turn but steadily faded entering
the lane. HONEY BEEST settled between foes in the last flight racing to the turn, angled out entering upper stretch to gain some position late but made no
real impression. CRYSTAL SKY, bumped at the start, was righted to make brief pursuit of the leaders between foes into the turn and gave way into upper
stretch. HIDEY HIDEY tracked off the second flight racing four wide to the turn and faded early. LADY PROTONICO settled along the inside early, angled
five wide racing into upper stretch but proved no threat. CHICA RAPIDA was a brief factor inside foes but dropped out early.

Footnotes
ITALIAN JUSTICE, caught in tight quarters three deep between foes in the opening three sixteenths, switched outside foes racing into the turn maintaining
terms with the second flight, was fanned five wide midstretch but continued with a steady late advance to prevail in time under brisk pressure. SOME SAY
SO, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace racing into the turn, pressed the issue into upper stretch, was fanned four wide racing through the lane while
challenging for command and just missed. MY SISTER'S KEEPER, held up between foes while racing in close quarters to the turn, gained position between
foes nearing upper stretch, angled to the rail entering the lane to bid for command inside the top pair but was just outkicked. FRERET broke sharply, angled
inwards setting the pace on a narrow advantage, dueled for command a bit off the rail through the turn to upper stretch and gave out nearing the wire. U
KNOW I B LION tracked off the first flight four wide in the opening stages, continued three deep between foes on the turn to upper stretch but lacked the
needed final kick. ALEXANDRA KAY angled to the inside early crowding several rivals, was urged in brief pursuit of the leaders along the rail into the turn,
then steadied out of tight quarters near midstretch and had no late response. PASSION'S IMAGE, held up along the inside avoiding tight quarters early,
failed to menace thereafter. ALYDARIUS dropped out early. FIFTYSHADESOGRAYCE broke awkwardly and trailed throughout.
