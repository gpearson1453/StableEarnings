Footnotes
MOSS BOSS pressured the pace through the backstretch and took over two deep approaching the quarter pole, contested the edge rounding the turn,
drifted toward the head of the lane but dug in under steady encouragement to moved clear mid-stretch and widened later yards. KUKULKAN broke slightly
outward then set a pressured pace inside, was caught nearing the quarter pole, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn and continued
a factor through the upper stretch, but dropped back a sixteenth away and flattened stride later yards. AKTHAM broke awkwardly and was bumped leaving
the gate, picked up the chase inside, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly through the lane. BOSEY broke inward the make contact with Aktham,
picked up the chase down the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and showed little more. IRISH LION was forced outward leaving the gate,
gave chase and raced near the rail on the turn though, never factored.

Footnotes
CRYPTOSONDE drifted into the first turn then stalked through the turn, challenged nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep at the five
sixteenths, raced clear into the far turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold off the later arrival of SHORT CAKE'S MAN, who was carried to the
four path into the first turn then stalked, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn and finished evenly
at the outside flank of the winner. ISLAND CADGER rated a short lead inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, was caught at the
five sixteenths, dropped back into the far turn and flattened down the lane. MASTER YOO saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole and entered the far turn just off the rail, however, angled to the five path through the turn and passed rivals in an even finish. JACKLIGHTING
raced off the pace about the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little further.
BRAVE NATIVE rated close toward the inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, though, showed little
more. CASTLE ONE raced well off the pace saving early ground, bid mildly approaching the three eighths pole and was carried to the six path on the far
turn.

little more. STRONG LIL KOKORO saved ground. SPINISH contested the pace through the backstretch but dropped back midway on the turn and

far turn in the four and five paths then dug in from the head of the lane and dueled through the final sixteenth for second. DEVILISH BEAUTY stumbled
leaving the gate then rounded the opening turn about the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path,
angled to the four path toward the head of the lane and was outfinished for second the final sixteenth. ESTHER'S FORTUNE dropped well back from early
contention while saving ground, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, angled to the four path into the lane and
finished evenly. SKYLAR'S TRICK took over and angled to the inside to set the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was caught
at the rail approaching the head of the lane and weakened the final furlong. COOL ENOUGH stalked the early pace from the two and three paths,
