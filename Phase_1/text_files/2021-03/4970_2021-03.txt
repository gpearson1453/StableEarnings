HAZELS LITTLE MAN broke alertly and led early, settled behind the pacesetter then wore down that rival late in a prolonged drive. HOLLYWOOD JET
rushed to a clear lead outside, widened on the turn then came up empty in the stretch. SAVATIANO lacked speed wide, moved closer on the turn and
continued willingly. SPIRIT WOLF dropped back inside, saved ground throughout and made a mild gain. DANG IT was urged off the leaders inside and
stopped abruptly.

clear under urging in the final sixteenth. MISCHIEVOUS JUAN vied outside for the lead, dueled with the winner on the turn, dug in gamely in upper stretch
and then came up second best. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT was bumped at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up four wide on the turn, rallied
mildly outside and got third. IMMINENT DANGER chased two wide, raced evenly in the stretch and just missed for third. CHARLIES SAFARI stumbled
badly at the start, quickly recovered and caught up to the field, then raced inside and failed to threaten. MOON MEISTER chased inside and faded.

BETTER YET dueled outside, took over into the far turn, moved well clear in mid stretch then remained safe driving. JUMPIN JETT settled inside, went after
the winner on the final turn and made a gradual late gain. MIJA BELLA lacked speed, advanced wide on the final turn and closed well too late. CHANCEE
earned a narrow lead inside, vied to the far turn and weakened. SERIOUS HAPPINESS trailed far behind then passed rivals without menacing. PRETTY
COOL CAT dropped back early and was never in contention. MAGALIE prompted the pace three wide and stopped abruptly.

GAMBIT'S GIRL quickly took control then widened throughout while kept to a drive in a dominating score. WILDCATTIN pursued the winner on the turn,
was no match and just lasted for the place. TIZ A DATE dropped back inside early then continued well while no threat. ZECHA trailed down the backstretch
then passed rivals with some late energy. UNCAPTURED RUBY raced close up three wide then began fading at the three eighths pole. UP JUST IN TIME
lacked speed, moved very wide on the turn while outrun. ANGEL RAPHAEL chased very wide and weakened steadily. IT'S A SHAW THING broke a step
slowly, rushed up and proved empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
ARK IN THE DARK stalked the pacesetter, bid two wide midway on the turn, took over in upper stretch, responded and drew clear under urging. SCREEN
SAVER stumbled at the start, chased three wide, raced three wide on the turn, rallied late between rivals and got the nod for second on the wire. DIG
CHARLIE DIG raced off the pace, moved up inside on the turn, rallied in the stretch run and just missed for the place spot. STAR SIGN steadied at the start,
raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane, rallied and was outkicked. G DADDY set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner turning for
home and weakened. BLACK LIGHT chased between rivals and tired. CALL ME DADDY raced off the rail, off the pace, four wide on the turn and did not
factor.

Footnotes
BREEZY GUST dueled along the rail, shook loose nearing the quarter pole then eagerly drew off driving. WAR TOCSIN chased along the inside and
continued gamely to the finish while no threat. WENTZ raced off the pace between foes, swung wide into the stretch rallying then flattened out. DANCING
BULL lunged at the start, rushed up inside then faded in the stretch. GRAVES ISLAND lacked speed in the two path early, moved wide and was outrun.
VIOLENT TURBULENCE dueled outside of the winner to near the quarter pole and tired. PNUTBUTTER SPECIAL was urged close up to the far turn three
wide then stopped.
