Footnotes
NAVARONES SPARKLE tracked the early pace, raced seven wide through the turn, took control at the quarter pole and edged clear for the win. IZZY B
was allowed to settle early, went six wide into the turn, angled out mid stretch and finished evenly late. GRAY BRIDE had a bad start, was void of speed,
raced along the inside into the turn, angled out through the turn drifting out far wide, re-gathered and finished belatedly. POLAR ROUTE was up close early,
raced five wide and weakened. AMBERS STORM pressed the early pace, went four wide and faded. SONGBIRD EYDIE set a pressured early pace, went
three wide and was finished early. DOLLIYS GOLD was outrun early, went six wide and offered no late rally. CAT IN THE PULPIT was unhurried early and
was no factor.
