Footnotes
CAR LADY lacked speed, saved ground around both turns, found room along the inner rail to take command inside the three sixteenths pole, drifted out
inside the eighth pole and eagerly pulled away while kept to her business. IMAGINE VICTORY stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the far turn
three wide, was well positioned turning for home and was no match for the winner. WALK IT OUT NANNY , quickly clear, set the pace near the rail, drifted
out entering the stretch and gave way. MALICEINTHEPALACE , rank entering the backstretch, angled out, circled horses on the far turn, was four deep
entering the stretch and failed to be a factor. PERSONAL SERVER chased the pace in the two path and gave way leaving the far turn. MOONLIGHT MISS
raced in the two path on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SICK PACK SARA came in at the break, sprinted to the early lead, angled in, set the pace along the inner rail and was hand ridden. TEXAS REWARD
lacked speed, was three wide around the turn and rallied nicely. KEEPYOURSKATESON , in tight quarters soon after the break, was never a factor and
circled the turn four wide. HELLO GRACIE hugged the inner rail on the turn, angled to the three path entering the stretch and failed to be a factor. GOLDEN
MOON SHINE , two wide chasing the early pace, gave way. SUBLIMITY , forced in leaving the starting gate, was outrun. GARY DOING BIZ hugged the
inner rail chasing the pace and gave way leaving the turn.

LITTLESTITIOUS , three wide off the duel around the turn, was under urging approaching the stretch, advanced outside horses in the lane and gained the
lead approaching the finish. FRAUDULENT CHARGE disputed the pace outside STREET LUTE, disposed of that rival near the eighth pole then gave way
grudgingly. STREET LUTE showed speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace to the eighth pole then weakened. JOURNEYTOTHEMOON , two wide on
the turn while off the duel, failed to be a factor. BUCKEY'S CHARM raced along the inner rail around the turn and lacked a rally.

GLORY MARCH bumped with BOBBINI when coming in at the break, was shuffled back soon after the start, hugged the inner rail on the turn, eased out to
the three path leaving the bend, closed inside GREAT CAUSE, swept to command inside the sixteenth pole and drove clear. GREAT CAUSE bumped with
BOBBINI when coming out at the break, showed speed along the inner rail, opened up on the turn, drifted to the four path near the eighth pole and
weakened late. JOYCE G. prompted the pace outside GREAT CAUSE and weakened the final three furlongs. TATICA saved ground around the turn, was
taken to the three path in mid stretch and passed tired horses. SLIP SLIDIN raced inside horses leaving the turn and was not a factor. LOOKS DON'T LIE ,
four wide on the turn, lacked a rally. BOBBINI , jostled on both sides leaving the starting gate, chased the pace down the backstretch and gave way leaving
the turn.

turn and passed tired rivals. STROLL SMOKIN bobbled slightly at the break, rushed up along the rail to take the lead approaching the turn, remained along

Footnotes
CORDMAKER assumed the early lead, set an easy pace near the rail, drifted out a bit in mid stretch and drew clear under pressure. GALERIO prompted
the pace outside the winner, was well placed leaving the far turn, drifted out in mid stretch, finished gamely and was second best. DIXIE DRAWL , along the
rail stalking the pace for six furlongs, eased out to the three path leaving the far turn and failed to rally in an even effort. FOREWARNED lacked speed,
raced along the inner rail most of the trip and rallied gamely. PLOT THE DOTS worked between horses in the stretch and offered a mild gain. MISCHIEF
AFOOT , outside horses down the backstretch, raced in the four path leaving the far turn and lacked a rally. TATTOOED , well placed inside horses, came
off the rail for the stretch drive and weakened. AWESOME D J , never a factor, was five deep entering the stretch. SARATOGA JACK , four deep entering
the first turn, gave way on the far turn.

KISS THE GIRL stalked the pace, circled the turn three deep, floated to the four path leaving the bend, closed outside horses, took the lead inside the
sixteenth pole and held sway under steady handling. LOOKIN DYNAMIC lacked speed, raced four deep leaving the turn and rallied outside rivals.
WHISPERING PINES hugged the inner rail throughout and rallied mildly late. ARTFUL SPLATTER took the early lead, opened up on the turn, was well off
the rail inn the stretch and gave way the final sixteenth of a mile. S W BRIAR ROSE chased the pace while in the two path on the turn and gave way. DEEP
RED , sluggish early, swung outside in upper stretch and was not a factor. COCONUT CAKE raced in the two path between horses on the turn and gave
way.

Footnotes
SHACKLED LOVE disputed the pace outside MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU, dueled furiously with that one through the stretch and proved best in an extended
drive. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU showed speed inside the winner, dueled with that one through the lane but was out finished. EXCELLORATOR had a shoe
repaired in the paddock, raced three wide the first turn, saved ground around the far turn and offered a mild rally. SHACKQUEENKING , four wide the first
turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up three deep on the far turn, remained on his left lead through the stretch and weakened. ZERTZ
lacked speed, raced outside horses in the drive and failed to be a factor. ROYAL NUMBER raced in the two path on the far turn, worked between horses in
the stretch and failed to rally. COMMODORE PERRY raced along the inner rail and was done leaving the backstretch.

Footnotes
PUSH TO START broke alertly and sped to the lead, set the pace near the rail, drifted out in mid stretch and edged away under urging. BAND ON TOUR
chased the pace outside the winner, remained on his left lead in the drive and hung. ZEN PI chased the pace in the two path around the turn, swung to the
four path in upper stretch and lacked a rally in an even effort. VISUAL ARTIST raced in the two path on the turn, was inside horses in the stretch and failed
to rally. DISPUTED NOTION , along the inner rail on the turn, was not a factor. CRYING FOR MORE , two wide on the turn, was not a factor.
