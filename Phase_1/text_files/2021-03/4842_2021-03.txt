close early on, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and kept on willingly to the wire. MR. WHITE was hustled along from the inside and weakened a bit in
the drive. DA VAN GEAUX dropped back early, was hustled throughout, saved ground and never threatened. RAIN RAY was slow early and trailed

DIXIE NATION stalked the pace, angled off the inside nearing the far turn, drifted to the six path in the upper stretch, dug in late and just got up under all out
pressure. CABO DORADO pressed the early leader, took command inside the eighth pole and just missed in a game effort while racing near the rail. U S S
LOIS was allowed to settle early on, moved up four wide through the lane and made a good late gain. SEATTLE BAY showed good early speed to set the
pace along the inside and weakened a bit in the drive. MUWAAN MAT settled off the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late
response. SILENT SURPRISE was slow early, raced along the inside down the backstretch and failed to respond.

the pace and weakened a bit in the latter stages. HANDY HANNON raced in tight quarters at the break, stalked the pace, saved ground and had not enough
in the drive. PICKLES N ME was bumped hard at the break, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and never was a serious threat. P

MOONFIELD raced up close while along the inside down the backstretch, moved up three wide in the stretch and finished well to get up under strong
encouragement. JAGGED ARROW was quick to begin to set all the pace along the inside and couldn't hold off the winner in the drive to finish second best.
SILVER MOON RISING was slow early on, moved up seven wide into the upper stretch and made a good late rally. WITCHY WINDSOR stalked the early
pace, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch an had no late rally. OKIE PRINCESS raced up close early, raced three deep and
weakened in the drive. NURSE LIST dropped back early, raced towards the inside throughout and had no response. REMNANT reared at the break, raced
four wide at the eighth pole and never menaced.

best. MAGIC IN A HAT settled off the top flight early, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. GET UP WENDY was slow
early on, moved up five wide into the lane and made a good late gain. SHEZA MACHIAVELLI raced four wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor.
