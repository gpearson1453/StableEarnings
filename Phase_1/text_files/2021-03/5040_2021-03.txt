under rating and outside DESBORDES leaving the far turn, bid to apply more pressure mid turn, took over four wide into the lane, was roused clear past the
three sixteenths then held firm under a drive. VIBRANCY stalked inside, was urged along to keep position mid turn, shifted out near mid stretch and
continued willingly to earn the place. SWEET HOME DIXIE settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out mid turn, was under asking into the stretch
then had belated action between rivals. TEQUILA FOG stalked between foes, shifted out under asking in upper stretch, moved up a bit past mid stretch then
flattened out. DESBORDES accelerated inside rivals and took over early on, set the pace towards the inside, was pressured mid turn, dueled in the two path
into the lane then weakened in the final furlong. ANNIKA GOLD , three to four wide outside foes, failed to kick on under urging past the five sixteenths and
faded.

TITAN'S WILL stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, advanced three deep to secure command approaching the stretch, steadily drew
away and was under urging in the drive. BIG RINNE lacked speed, angled six wide entering the stretch and rallied outside horses. POLITICAL raced in the
three path between horses on the turn, chased the winner while inside BIG RINNE through the stretch and faded. RUNNER RUNNER INDY , four deep on
the turn while forwardly placed, floated to the five path turning for home and weakened. AUDACIOUS QUALITY lacked speed, was seven deep entering the
stretch and failed to be a menace. AMEN CORNER saved ground around the turn and weakened through the stretch. GLORIOUS WEEKEND hugged the
inner rail entering the stretch and lacked a rally. GATOR FIFTY TWO , inside horses on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and weakened. KORCZAK
showed speed along the inner rail, drifted out turning for home and faltered. GHOST ON A MISSION prompted the pace outside KORCZAK and faltered.

Footnotes
CRY NO MORE broke sharply, prompted the pace three wide outside the leader, took over in hand mid turn, moved clear entering the lane, drifted in under
a drive leaving mid stretch then dug in gamely through the final fifty yards to prove best. SIBELIUS , unseated his rider when a bit unruly pre race, had his
head turned slightly as the gates sprung forcing his to come away a couple lengths behind the field, recovered and moved up towards the inside through the
opening furlong, eased out and progressed between foes heading towards the turn, tracked a contested pace past the three eighths, entered the lane
pursuing two wide, took closer aim of the winner in mid stretch, altered out after that one drifted in, straightened and finished determinedly to bridge the gap.
RECKLESS PLACE settled off the rail, came three wide giving chase into the stretch but lacked a solid response. SOUPER EMPEROR , unhurried early
while saving some ground, angled three wide past the five sixteenths and had belated interest. JOHN THE BEAR had speed and disputed the pace inside
the winner, ceded command around the turn, angled out approaching the quarter pole, wandered well wide into the lane then weakened. INDEFATIGABLE
gave early chase and weakened. PATHWAY TO VICTORY was outrun.

Footnotes
SILENT MALICE saved ground stalking the pace around the turn, found ample room along the inner rail in upper stretch to take the lead, opened a clear
advantage in mid stretch, was collared late and got the bob at the finish. POINT DRIVEN , was under urging leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path
inside horses on the turn, angled to the four path entering the stretch, gained a short lead late then just missed. SEA GHOST lacked speed, was taken to
the inner rail turning for home and rallied inside horses. FAST BREAK chased the pace outside NEW FRONTIER around the turn and weakened the final
furlong. NEW FRONTIER , sent to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail, drifted out entering the stretch and tired. ROYAL CRUSADER , four wide
on the turn, was not a factor. JAMMINWITHBRANDON chased the pace outside horses around the turn, drifted to the six path in upper stretch, gave way
and was eased late. PERPETRATE , outrun, was checked in close quarters along the inner rail entering the turn. AL BROWN raced in the three path
between horses on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
WHISKEY AND YOU prompted the pace two wide, bid outside GREAT GO GO mid turn, took command after a half mile, was roused clear past the three
sixteenths, opened up under a hearty drive with a furlong remaining and proved much the best while kept to task. MICE AND MEN settled off the pace while
saving ground, eased out and picked up momentum past the three eighths, came four wide pursuing into the stretch, continued willing progress past the
eighth pole then saved the place. TOMMY SHELBY , bumped and in close at the break, saved ground while well back early on, moved up while saving
ground into the stretch, angled out in mid stretch and finished with good energy. SELF AWARENESS came in at the break and bumped with TOMMY
SHELBY, corrected and edged up to stalk three wide outside the leaders, was under pressure pursuing into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then faded.
TOM TERRIFIC saved ground while in range mid turn, angled out under asking past the three sixteenths but came up empty. GREAT GO GO sped clear
early, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure past the three eighths, sparred inside the winner heading into the stretch, failed to match strides soon
after then gave way through the final furlong. NAUTICAL NATURE dropped back early, swung five wide approaching the stretch but failed to generate a
kick. FORFIFTYFIVEROCKET , three wide nearing the turn, dropped back past the five sixteenths, was eased then pulled up in the lane, examined and
vanned off.

Footnotes
ARTILLERY stalked the pace, found room near the inner rail through the stretch, bid for the lead in mid stretch, dueled late and narrowly prevailed.
MANKLIN CREEK lacked speed, swung outside in upper stretch, gained a short lead approaching the eighth pole, dueled and hung. HERE COMES RUDY ,
sent to the early lead, set the pace near the rail, drifted out turning for home and gave way. RUNBACK stalked the pace, raced along the inner rail on the far
turn, faltered in upper stretch and was eased. ALWAYS BIZ , three wide the first turn, advanced three deep to challenge for the lead near the five sixteenths
pole, was carried out severely by PAT'S FACTOR entering the stretch, was eased but managed to cross the finish line. PAT'S FACTOR prompted the pace
two wide and unseated his rider when bolting entering the stretch. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run leaving the far turn but no action was
taken.
