Footnotes
SHE'SANEARTHMOVER was brushed at the start, sped forward to the set the pace in the two path, drew clear rounding the far turn, drifted out in
midstretch, dug in outside a foe through the final sixteenth and held firm. CUZZYWUZZY settled off the pace while racing two wide around the first turn,
raced at the rail around the far turn, closed inside, bid near the sixteenth pole but could not get past the winner. MOTHERS DAY JEWEL was bumped soon
after the start, saved ground in midpack, swung four wide in upper stretch and rallied outside. CARELESS HEIRESS tracked the pace inside, angled three
wide near the five-sixteenths pole, had a mild bid in upper stretch and evened out through the final furlong. DREAMING OF AUDREY was bumped at the
start, raced well back two and three wide and rallied belatedly. HARDLY SOCIAL was bumped between foes at the start, raced three wide and never
threatened. PARTY SWAGGER was bumped soon after the start, saved ground well back, went four wide around the far turn and made little impact.
BRYNBELLA broke out and bumped HARDLY SOCIAL into DREAMING OF AUDREY, prompted the winner in the three path and faded in the stretch. RED
WIND chased the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. TOOLEGITTOQUIT hit the starting gate then brushed the winner at the start,
saved ground well back, went five wide around the far turn and played no further factor. KHOSEA was in range three wide and lacked a closing bid. GREEN
GAL was very reluctant to load, broke slowly, veered in early and trailed inside.

Footnotes
LADY FIORELLA advanced four wide midway on the turn, put a head in front of MY LITTLE ROSE near the quarter-pole, battled outside that rival through
the stretch and edged away late. ABARRIO FOREVER began moving four wide after a half-mile, rallied steadily and was up outside for second at the wire.
MY LITTLE ROSE sprinted clear early in the two-path, fought back when confronted by LADY FIORELLA on the turn, battled inside through the lane and
yielded in the final 70 yards. FAST FRACTION raced two to three wide around the turn, and lacked the needed response. LALALI chased three wide to the
stretch, and had no rally. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA faded inside after a half. PLAY THAT TONE trailed in the two-path.

turn and weakened the lane. WESTERLY WIND failed to menace while racing three wide. CONFUCIO played no factor while racing four wide.

Footnotes
DAHLONEGA dueled outside SILVER TUNES early, edged away through mid stretch, then had enough to hold on. WAR STAR was hemmed in behind the
leaders and inside THE GREAT KATH around the turn, gained clearance in upper stretch, finished gamely but could not reach the winner. LA CARA
BONITA raced two wide around the turn, and rallied mildly. THE GREAT KATH kept WAR STAR bottled up through the turn, then faded into the lane.
SILVER TUNES dueled inside DAHLONEGA to the stretch, and faded. FOXY MISCHIEF reared at the start spotting the field two to three lengths, and was
never close. BEAST OF WILDWOOD hit the left side of the gate and was off slow, and trailed inside. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS
UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
YES THIS TIME set a rated pace along the rail, was headed near the quarter pole, re-cleared in upper stretch and held firm under a drive. KARTANO raced
off the pace three wide, went four wide around the far turn and rallied outside to gain the place. ZIPPY BABY raced well back inside, swung out in upper
stretch and rallied widest. HONORABLE raced two wide in midpack, gained some inside in upper stretch and flattened out late. WENTRU rated behind the
winner while saving ground, angled three wide turning for home and was one-paced between foes. THORN tracked the pace three wide and lacked a
closing bid. GHOSTLYPRINCE prompted the winner two wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole but tired in the lane.

Footnotes
WORA pressed the early pace between NACO and SCRAPPY ARTIE, took over turning for home and edged clear, then widened while drifting out under a
drive. BAGBOSS saved ground into the turn, came to the two-path at the top of the stretch behind the leaders, moved past NACO and went back to the rail
past the eighth-pole and rallied for the place. SCRAPPY ARTIE pressed the pace three wide, weakened through the stretch but was clearly best of the
others. JEEBAR broke a step slow, rushed up along the rail for a few strides but was forced to steady behind BAGBOSS, moved out four wide approaching
the stretch, and came up empty. NACO set the pace inside a pair of pursuers for three-eighths of a mile, and weakened into the lane. SUCCESSFUL ONE
was outrun throughout. HIERRO was outrun three to four wide. TIME TO WISH was finished early three wide. JUSTICE WARRIOR broke slowly and was
far back throughout.

Footnotes
WINK set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and held firm under a drive. LIONESSOFBRITTANY prompted the pace three wide, could not
quite match strides with the winner in upper stretch but continued on willingly to narrow the gap late. CAN'T BUY LOVE lacked speed while racing two wide,
swung out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. RUNNING MEMORIES turned her head at the start, race off the pace outside, angled in nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, rallied along the rail, ran up on heels and checked near the quarter pole, got through in upper stretch and had a mild gain. SLEEK
LYNX (GB) lagged inside early, angled out in upper stretch and never threatened. FOUZIA broke inwardly, chased the pace inside, swung four wide near
the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a rally. ROCKET RELOAD pressed the pace two wide between foes and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
PERFECT CUT saved ground early in striking range, briefly tried to get through between horses but paused momentarily outside the five-sixteenths, moved
out three wide rallying into the stretch with clearance, ranged up alongside GROUP HUG past the furlong marker and was up for a hard-fought decision.
GROUP HUG advanced steadily into the turn while shifting out four wide, took over outside EVERESTING at the top of the stretch, shifted inward drawing
clear briefly, dug in when challenged from outside by PERFECT CUT and just missed. TAITA saved ground outrun early, began finding stride after six
furlongs while swinging out four wide, rallied past the eighth-pole and was picking up the leaders from outside at the finish. EVERESTING pressed RIDIN
WITH BIDEN from outside, reached a short lead between horses past the five-sixteenths, yielded to GROUP HUG at the top of the stretch, and faded.
EMPEROR'S CAUSE hit the right side of the gate at the start, and made no impact three wide. RIDIN WITH BIDEN stumbled at the start, sprinted to the
front out of the chute, faced multiple challenges coming to the quarter-pole and folded up. TALLIS saved ground to no avail. SWING LOW stumbled at the
start, and was outrun. CHIEFICIA showed brief speed, and was finished after a half-mile.

Footnotes
TIESTO hopped at the start to get away last, tracked the pace two wide around the first turn and three wide around the far turn, came four wide into the
lane, bid outside of ADVANCED STRATEGY nearing the eighth pole, dueled outside of that foe to deep stretch and dug in between to hold off MYSTIC
LANCELOT'S late outside charge. MYSTIC LANCELOT settled off the pace two wide, angled out in upper stretch, closed outside and just missed.
ADVANCED STRATEGY stalked the pace inside, angled three wide nearing the lane, split rivals in upper stretch, took the lead inside of the winner nearing
the eighth pole, battled on inside to the wire and was narrowly outfinished. TULFARRIS (GB) was a bit rank while fighting a tight hold near the rear of the
field through the opening six furlongs, angled three wide rounding the far turn, came widest into the lane, continued on the left lead and rallied belatedly.
KAUFY BEAN pressed the pace two wide, came in and bumped SAMBACER into KING SLEW in midstretch and tired. KING SLEW (ARG) broke in a
tangle, saved ground off the pace, made progress inside in upper stretch but was severely impeded near the eighth pole and not persevered with from
there. SAMBACER set the pace along the rail, was bumped inward near the eighth pole, checked and was kept in hand from there. FOLLOWING AN
INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED KAUFY BEAN FROM FIFTH AND PLACED HIM LAST FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
PACIFIC GALE followed behind the leaders near the inside entering the turn, waited for room a quarter-mile out, maneuvered smoothly to the three-path
and got shaken up straightening away for the drive, caught SOUND MACHINE from outside past the eighth-pole and drew away hand urged. SOUND
MACHINE advanced three wide on the turn, took over outside CORY GAL going comfortably at the top of the stretch, could not withstand the winner into the
last eighth of a mile but stayed clear of the rest. SAGUARO ROW broke slowly and trailed up the backstretch inside, swung five wide off the turn, put in a
mild run through upper stretch but could not sustain the bid. SLAM DUNK raced three to four wide around the turn, and could not reach contention. CORY
GAL set the pace near the inside, got overhauled leaving the turn, and gave way on the rail. ROYAL MEGHAN broke slowly and was outrun inside. SONAR
pressed CORY GAL from outside for a half-mile, and gave way into the stretch. RELUCTANT BRIDE broke slowly and was always outrun.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S PRIDE was away alertly, sped to a clear lead, set the pace along the rail, held clear to deep stretch and lasted under a steady drive. KASIM
steadied early, saved ground well back, angled out in upper stretch and rallied between foes. FIELD DAY chased two wide between down the backstretch,
steadied nearing the turn, continued two wide around the bend, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied outside while outkicked for the place. OMAHA CITY
raced off the pace three wide and rallied belatedly. DR. DUKE had early speed inside, checked into the turn, continued to save ground, moved up inside in
upper stretch but flattened out late. NITRO TIME raced closest to the winner in the clear in the two path and came up empty in the lane. NO QUE NO played
no factor while racing four wide.

Footnotes
VOW ME NOW broke sharply to the lead, fended off OUTSHINE turning for home, and remained clear under pressure. OUTSHINE pressed VOW ME NOW
from outside, could not get by while under a drive on the far turn, and ran on best of the others. GOLDEN DECISION raced two to three wide around the far
turn, finished evenly and was clear of the remainder. MY POINT EXACTLY raced in the two-path most of the way, and had no closing bid. AMBASSADOR
JIM raced three wide around the turns, and failed to menace. COWBOY'S HERO saved ground and was never a factor. MOZO BELLO broke slowly and
was outrun. FARLEY was outrun through a four-wide journey. SHOT TANKER (CHI) tired inside after a half-mile. ANOTHER became rank behind horses
approaching and around the first turn, got taken to the far outside up the backstretch, and dropped far back into the lane.
