KISS ME SUZY high early speed, hand ridden. BARBIE WAGON chased good winner, clear second. BIG CASH CARTEL no match for top two. KISS WITH
A FIST out slowly and awkwardly, kept on. RELENTLESSLY ROYAL bore out badly. VF RED SURPRISE 3 lacked serious bid. HES A TRAVELLING MAN
raced evenly. JESS A JET did not keep up. AJ HELENE broke slowly, lacked room, threw head, steadied. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE START FOR KISS WITH A FIST AND RULED HIM A STARTER, AS HE CAUSED HIS OWN ISSUES BY SITTING BACK AS THE FIELD WAS
DISPATCHED, CAUSING HIS FLIPPING HALTER TO BRIEFLY HOLD HIS GATES SHUT.
