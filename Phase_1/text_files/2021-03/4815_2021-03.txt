Footnotes
CATCH THIS STAR sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won under steady urging. THE THIMBLE pressed the pace, forwardly placed
throughout and was a clear second at the wire. REDOUX raced in the middle of the field in the early going, saved ground around the second turn, made late
bid and proved third best. MY LITTLE FLACO lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. OUT MAKING TREBLE raced evenly near the back
and showed little. WAYPOINT pressed the early pace, faltered around the final turn and faded. PRIORITY POINTS always raced near the back and was
outrun.

Footnotes
RUN NOW ESTELLA pressed the pace, saved ground around the final turn, dueled early down the stretch with SEE SASSY RUN and pulled away before
the wire. SEE SASSY RUN was an early factor, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the stretch, couldn't keep up with the winner, but was best of
others. DUEPEG raced near the back in the early part, made a mild bid, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. OLD FASHION AMOUR
went to the front, drove clear and faded. MISS NEKO raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. ONETWOMANYROCKETS void of early speed
and was never close.

Footnotes
GOLDEN BET unhurried in the early part, moved up on the outside around the turn, rallied and was going away at the end. MATT'S PRIDE raced within
contention, made a bid, couldn't match strides with the winner late, but was a clear second. ROSE RUNNER vied for the early lead, drove clear, lacked a
late kick and proved no match for the top two. SHESTHECATSMEOW raced in the middle of the pack, made a mild bid and was outfinished for third.
QUEEN BINDALA lacked early speed, raced six wide around the turn, moved up, but was no factor. QUEEN SHASTA pressed the early pace and faded.
CHATAIN'S FLYER void of early speed and was never a threat. GEAUX GOLDEN bobbled at the start, racing in the back, rushed up, challenged for the
lead and dropped back.
