Footnotes
PERFECT EDITION was away alertly, settled mid pack through the backstretch, maintained a three wide trip through the second turn, was asked for run at
the head of the stretch and kicked clear. STATEFOREST settled toward the rear of the field through the early running, advanced position along the second
turn, came four wide into the stretch and made a late bid for second. LIS LA VICTOIRE sat just off the early pace, saved ground along the backstretch and
into the second turn, put a head in front in the stretch and tired back to third. SWEET TOPPER settled midpack while saving ground in the two path, lost
position along the second turn, and finished evenly. GREY ABBEY was unhurried early, settling at the rear of the field, saved ground along the backstretch
and into the second turn and had no late kick for the final stages. ANGELS RULE assumed command of early fractions while traveling along the rail, was
confronted at the head of the stretch and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
DUB TOWN had the best speed and dropped over, set all the pace off the rail, turned back MOSQUITO FLEET on the second turn then dug in determinedly
through the stretch to hold. K P D DAY was chasing to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch, could not catch the winner but dug in gamely to get
the nod for second. BIG CITY BANE was settled to the half mile pole, circled rivals five wide on the far turn, responded in the drive but was outnodded for
the place. EXETER chased the winner while four wide throughout and lacked the needed late response. LUCK IS MY NAME had no speed, settled to the
second turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch but was weakening late. MOSQUITO FLEET pressed the winner to the second turn, pushed up to
briefly loom a threat at the five sixteenths but was turned back into the stretch and gave way. PAPER BOY was slow to settle and trailed throughout.

TESORO stalked the pace to the second turn, pushed up three wide to engage for the lead, dueled to mid stretch then edged clear driving. ME B BUBBA T
was quickest and set the pace to the backstretch, dueled off the rail to the stretch, stayed to mid stretch then dug in to hold second. EXALTED JOY was four
wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch and was gaining ground belatedly. THEULTIMATEPRAISE hopped slightly
and was off about three lengths last, trailed to the backstretch then pushed up inside rivals to engage ME B BUBBA T for the lead, dueled to the stretch then
was outkicked and tired. COMMAND SGT MAJOR had no speed and was never a factor.

GENTLEMAN'S SECRET briefly checked back off heels in the opening furlong, settled to the turn, rallied three then four wide to the stretch, pushed clear in
mid stretch and held driving. GLORY CALL attended the pace between rivals and two wide to the stretch then got outrun by the winner but held the place.
KLAY NATION stalked the pace early, bid three wide to engage for the lead into the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. HARDY
CHISEL chased the leaders while two wide to the stretch then came up empty in the drive. IRISH TERRIER had no speed and was never a threat. DELTA
FORUM hustled to duel for the lead from the rail to the quarter pole but tired in the stretch.

FOREFATHERS FURY had keen speed to duel the runnerup to the turn, inched away to the stretch then kicked clear to mid stretch and was under steady
urging to the line. DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI also showed good speed while contesting the pace to middle of the turn, got outkicked to the stretch then was no
match while easily second best. LUCKY LAGS was very green and dropped back steadily to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then leveled out late.
RUN IT TO WIN was chasing early, got outrun while three wide to the stretch and was not a factor. MOON ASCENDING was also a chaser early, saved
ground on the turn then had trouble switching leads in the drive and dropped back.

to put in a late kick to wear down JAZZ HANDS. JAZZ HANDS set early fractions while saving ground along the rail, dueled in the last sixteenth with BIG
DUKE but held on for second. JUNGLE CRY was unhurried early, advanced position along the turn while traveling four wide then finished willingly.
ROUSING SLAMMER sat off of the early pace, lost position along the turn while three wide but weakened in the final furlong. CRISTIANO'S DREAM
stalked the early pace while traveling in the two path, lost position while coming off of the turn and weakened. PAPPY BOYINGTON settled off of the early

and finished evenly for third. REVEREND AL sat just off of the early pace while saving ground along the turn, was asked for run in the stretch and finished
evenly. KINCAID PARK was hustled early to set the pace, saved ground along the turn, and faded in the stretch. MISTER MCLEAN sat just off of early pace
down the backstretch, advanced position along the turn, was two wide between horses on the turn, looked for racing room into the drive, had to take up in
the stretch while on MISSED THE BOAT's heels, and had no late response. UNBRIDLED'S SKYE had no early speed while traveling towards the rear of the
field, was four wide along the turn and was outrun.
