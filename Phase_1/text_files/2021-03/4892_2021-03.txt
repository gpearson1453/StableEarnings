Footnotes
KLEINMEISTER pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn, made a late rally, four wide and proved the best late. SHANGHAI HETTY vied for the
early lead, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for the win. AUDACIOUS GIRL dueled for the early advantage, drifted in entering the turn,
raced close throughout and was outfinished by the top two. FASHION MERIT pressed the pace, steadied entering the turn, getting in tight quarters and went
to the wire evenly. NOT ENOUGH BLING raced in the middle of the field, saved ground and put forth an even effort. KELLYS THE BOSS raced near the
back, lacked a rally and was never a factor. SWEET PINOT broke a step slow and was never close. RUNAWAY DEB broke slow and showed little.
ACHANCETOWIN lacked early speed and was outrun. THE JOCKEY OF #1 FASHION MERIT LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #6 AUDACIOUS
GIRL FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE TURN. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #6 FROM THIRD AND PLACED HER
FOURTH.

LUCKY STREAKER vied for the early lead, raced close throughout and drove clear before the wire. JR'S SAUVAGE raced within contention, saved ground
around the final turn, made a late rail bid, proved no match for the winner, but held off a late running CH BERN. CH BERN lacked early speed, made a
steady gain, racing outside around the second turn, made a late rally and finished willingly. MAJESTIC SOCIETY void of early speed, raced wide around the
final turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. LIL BIT OF JUSTICE raced near the middle of the pack, made a bid and hung. POWER SERVE raced evenly
near the back and was no threat. GRAND TRIBUTE raced within striking distance and faded. NOCOMET dueled on the front end in the beginning, drove
clear saved ground and was finished early. AND YET ANOTHER raced near the middle of the field and retreated to the rear.

PRAY IDE SING challenged for the early lead, saved ground, took command and was going away at the end. ALAN'S ARGUMENT vied for the early
advantage, drove clear, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. BRUTALIZE raced within striking distance, came around the turn on
the outside, made a mild bid and proved third best. GOLDEN PALACE lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn, improved position, but was no
factor. ROUND QUARTER lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn and was no threat late. BIG BOSS MAN pressed the early pace and dropped
back.

STEPHEN'S ANSWER pressed the pace, took command around the final turn, pulled away and proved much the best. KRAFTY BOY unhurried in the early
part, made a bid around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. MISTAKE PRESENT raced within contention, forwardly placed
throughout and lacked a finish. TEMPRANO showed early speed, saved ground, weakened and finished evenly. FLASHING ANGELBABY raced in the
middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. GREAT raced near the back, came around the first turn wide and was never close. WHY GOD void of early
speed and was never a threat. ALLTHEWAYWITHTAYE went to the front, drove clear and stopped.

SUMMER APPEAL trailed in the early part, moved up on the outside around the final turn, entered the stretch wide and drove clear before the wire.
SPENDAHOLIC dueled for the early lead, raced close throughout, but proved no match late for the winner. CAJUN CASH raced near the back at the start,
came around the first turn five wide, moved up, challenged for the lead and was outfinished by the top two. THEBOYZHOUR raced evenly near the back in
the early part, made a mild bid, but was no factor. MINE INSPECTOR was an early factor and faded. WHISKEY'S GONE dueled on the front end and
dropped back.

speed, racing in the back, made a late rally and finished willingly. ROCKTHEPULPIT pressed the pace, raced five wide around the first turn, raced close
throughout, but proved third best at the wire. RANGE OF MOTION lacked early speed, moved up wide around the second turn, made a bid and was
outfinished for third. SHAR'S TREASURE pressed the pace, eased back, made a mild bid late, but was no factor. SHOT ON WINDY HILL unhurried in the
early going, came around the second turn wide and finished evenly. CAPE TOWN WILLY lacked early speed, raced wide around the second turn and was
never a threat. SENT'S GALAXY raced within contention and faded. ELLA'S ACTOR dueled on the front end, saved ground and dropped back.
