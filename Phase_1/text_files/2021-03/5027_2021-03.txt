Footnotes
CATECHISM broke alertly, dueled up front in the two path, continued to alternated up front far turn, shook off the other speed turning for home, well clear
past the furlong marker then was fully extended to last and narrowly prevail. RED BOTTOM REBEL broke back, trailed early in lacking speed, advanced in
the two path into the stretch, moved out slightly, finished full of run to be rapidly getting to the winner late. CLEAR STEPS alternated up front inside the
winner for just less than a half and began to weaken. DONTMESWITHDISCAT chased the dueling leaders up the backstretch along the inside, steered out
three wide when moving slightly closer late in the turn, came up empty for the drive to. BETWEEN THE HEDGES in mid pack and three wide, dropped
inside late in the turn to save ground into the stretch, failed to rally. MOORAC pushed in and bothered at the start to be last away, was used to move up into
the second flight, floated out four wide into the lane, tired through the stretch. BLUEBIRD DAY failed to menace while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
LOUEMMA in the second flight early outside, advanced to challenge three wide far turn, vied between rivals into the lane, dueled, wore down foe late under
steady handling. TALLANDLONG broke with the leaders, dueled into the turn closest to the inside, held a narrow advantage into the stretch, dueled past the
furlong marker then proved stubborn until late while remaining closest to the inside. FAST SOPHIA moved out while racing in mid pack early, four wide
move to challenge on the outside turning for home, hung in the drive. SPILLED PERFUME stumbled at the start to break inward, raced back and inside, two
path into the lane, staged a mild rally to finish up best of the others. NO DIRECT MATCHES away well, dueled up front outside the runner up for four
furlongs, weakened from between rivals into the stretch. ANGEL ARKIE .off the pace and the inside, three wide into the stretch, went evenly through the
lane. HADLEYS HERO in mid pack while off the inside, came four wide when moving a bit closer turning for home, lacked a further bid to also finish up one
paced. HIGHTAIL RUNAWAY lacked speed, four wide exiting the turn, was found lacking response in the drive as well. CADDO QUEEN hesitated then
bobbled off the heels of a stumbling SPILLED PERFUME, remained always back. COZY WISH was always outrun while racing wide. COMANCHE MOON
within striking distance along the inside, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
FOREVERNOA with the pace from the start, dueled up front in the two path, larger lead midway on the second turn, shook clear when straightened for
home, held the runner up comfortably safe the final furlong under steady handling. LUNA FORTIS within striking distance off the inside, moved closer three
wide midway on the second turn, could do little with the winner through the stretch while drifting slightly, clearly second best. HELLO DARLING void of
speed from the beginning, continued back, swung five wide into the lane, along for the show down the middle of the strip while not al threat to the top two.
SUBIACO went one paced while racing off the inside. LAURIEANN broke on top, narrowly showed the way into the first turn inside, dueled the middle half
then began to falter. SHE'S DIVINE fractious in the gate, off a step slow, four wide into and through the first turn, continued outside, slightly closer while
remaining in the four path second turn, tired in the drive. GHAALEB THE GREAT was finished early while racing inside.

Footnotes
WAR BALLAD behind the first flight outside, four then five wide through the turn when moving a bit closer, outside bid late, edged clear late under firm
handling. FABULOUS GIRL unruly while loading into the gate, broke alertly, vied between rivals, continued to contest the issue into the lane, dueled upper
stretch, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late. FLEETA BELLE also broke well, set or forced the pace for five furlongs closest to the inside, drifted out
slightly under a left handed crop, switched to right handed, lost crop midstretch, weakened a bit, remained clear of the others. HUSH Y'ALL broke slowly,
trailed early as a result, came three wide into the lane, improved position through some traffic while not a serious threat. FIERY LADY void of speed while
off the inside, two path through the turn, also improved position. SHOWIT raced in mid pack toward the inside, came up empty the final furlong. FRIENDLY
AND KIND broke back, saved ground, improved position into the stretch then flattened out in the final furlong. BACKSEAT PROMISES in mid pack while off
the inside, was fanned four wide into the stretch, had little left for the stretch run. J P'S GLADYS failed to menace with a four wide trip. TEXAS MUSIC broke
well with the runner up outside that one, steadily faded. ENTRUSTED with the pace for a half three wide, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
GREELEY AND BEN broke with the field, was asked early to move up the rail and contest the pace, helped set some quick early fractions, shook clear
turning for home, enough left to hold the runner up off in the waning strides. UNDERCOVER LOVER back off the pace and the inside, in the two path
through the turn, switched out for the drive, set down, finished up willingly to be steadily gaining on the winner. HE'S MEANT TO BE broke sharp, vied early
in the two path, pressed the winner through the turn, could not match that one in the drive nor contain the runner up, enough left to hold the show. I
BELONG TO BECKY within striking distance well off the inside, raced three wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick. COACH ADAMS in mid pack
outside, raced four out to five wide through the turn, lacked a rally through the stretch. WHENTHEDOVESCRY off a step slow, trailed in lacking speed for a
half, improved position a bit in the drive by passing a couple of tiring rivals. ELZABE'S ON BOARD saved ground to no avail. TOUGH STUFF tired after
three wide.

Footnotes
EMERALD PRINCESS broke alertly, set the pace along the inside while pressured, bit of a breather late in the turn, cleared past the furlong marker, held
the runner up safe late under steady handling. SHES GOT IT prompted the pace while racing three wide, lost ground to the winner while remaining in the
three path, set down, slowly getting back to that same rival late, remained clear for the place. MARTIQUE MISS pressed the pace while between foes for a
half, fell back off the top two entering the stretch. LIVING FOR TODAY lacked early foot despite being asked, moved from the three down to two path far
turn, improved slightly while not a serious threat. BEAUTY CONTEST broke back, moved inside while lagging well back, continued to save ground turn,
improved position up the inside while also not posing a serious. NORTHERN DIAMOND in mid pack, came four wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally.
DIVINE CHOICE in the second flight while along the inside, moved out into the two path turning for home, faded. FOREVER HOME in mid pack while racing
off the inside, also backed up when the real running began at the head of the lane. CANDY RUNNER was finished early. ILEAVETHELIGHTON broke
outward and a step slow, was always outrun while four wide.

Footnotes
NEWS FLASH broke alertly, contested the pace while between foes, headed upper stretch, slight drift past the furlong marker, found more late to prove best
in a determined effort. K W CAPTAIN HOOK chased the lead back just off the inside, ranged up to challenge four wide turning for home, drifted in past the
furlong marker to tighten up HANSENS MISCHIEF under a right handed stick, was straightened only to be outkicked by the winner in the final sixteenth.
GEMO RAIN settled off the pace toward the inside, moved out to be three wide turning for home, moved out a bit more, mild rally to earn the show.
NASHVEGAS void of speed, continued back, fanned six wide into the lane, improved position while remained widest through the stretch. HEISFANCY dwelt
at the start, dropped immediately to the inside, continued to save ground turn, waited briefly late in the turn behind traffic, improved position when clear.
CARDIAC KITTEN in mid pack while off the inside up the backstretch, dropped inside three furlongs out, came back out a bit around a tiring rival exiting the
turn, finished up evenly. HIDDEN PROMISE raced in the main body outside, four out to five wide turning for home between rivals, lacked a closing
response. MISTER OAKLEY lacked speed in the two path, waited briefly behind a wall of horses midway ln the turn, came up empty when clear for the
drive. HANSENS MISCHIEF with the pace after breaking in good order, vied three wide into the turn, was falling back off the issue when put in tight by a
drifting K W CAPTIAN HOOK with a furlong remaining, checked up and quickly fell back. TOWN DRUNK headed up the second flight in the run up the
backstretch, two path through the turn, had little left for the drive. ICE PEAK with the pace for a half along the inside, stopped. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF HANSENS MISCHIEF AGAINST K W CAPTIAN FOR
INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED NINTH.

Footnotes
HEARTBREAKER broke alertly, set the pace inside by a narrow margin, headed inside the furlong ground, fought back in game fashion to prove best in a
game effort. MEGATAP forwardly placed off the inside, pressed the winner three wide into the lane, long drive, put a head in front late, outkicked in the final
yards. MY HONEY'S PERFECT broke well, dueled into the turn in the two path, continued to do battle while vying past the furlong marker, not enough for
the first two. BAMALAMA in mid pack while racing off the inside, three out to four wide through the turn, improved slightly to be slowly getting to the top
three. AWESOME CHARGE lacked speed while racing outside, four wide through the turn, went evenly in the drive. TWIRLING ROSES behind the pace
while racing just off the inside, came up empty for the drive. AMERICAN UNITY hesitated break, raced back off the inside, came four wide out of the turn,
improved slightly while not posing a serious threat. THATS A NO NO lacked early foot, failed to menace. PIZZA CHARLIE broke back and was never a
factor. CHICAGO CHROME off the pace while inside, faded through the stretch. LAZARETTO in mid pack while racing outside, came four wide into the
lane, faded.

Footnotes
RARE FORM in tight, steadied into the first turn along the rail, chased the leader up the backstretch, went after that one late in the final turn, dueled through
the stretch, proved best late while fully extended. HOME RUN TRICK angled in into the first turn putting the winner in tight, well clear of that one before a
quarter, showed the way the middle half by a wide margin, responded when confronted by the winner into the lane, dueled to the wire, proved game to miss,
clearly second best. DUNPH lacked speed inside, moved out onto the backstretch, three wide second turn, proved no match for the top two late, edged
clear for the show pot. CLEAR THE MINE one paced throughout while saving ground, lacked a closing punch in the drive, outkicked for the third position.
SECRET HOUSE second flight three wide first turn, continued off the inside, had little left for the drive. EGO last away, trailed most of the way, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals while failing to menace. GITA'S LAD remained always back. NEW MEXICO was finished early.

Footnotes
SIR WELLINGTON pushed in a bit at the break, moved out early behind the pace to be three wide into the turn, advanced, challenged outside the early
leader entering the stretch, quickly disposed of that rival when straightened for home, well clear past the furlong marker, enough left to withstand a bid from
the runner up. JAXON TRAVELER in the second group while inside the winner, advanced on the pacesetter with that rival late in the turn, fell back, switched
out nearing the furlong marker, finished willingly to be steadily gaining on the victor late. GAME DAY PLAY last away, fell far back, continued to lag early in
the turn, two path into the lane, mild rally to be up for the show, no threat to the top two. CAZADERO lagged well back, three wide into the lane, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals, not enough for the show. LOCK UP broke well, quickly sprinted clear, large advantage into the lane, offered little resistance to the top
two when confronted into the lane. DUSTY HILL in the second flight early, three path turn, backed up stretch.

Footnotes
GASLIGHT broke in a bit, raced with the pace from the start, clear onto the backstretch, turned back early bid, stayed clear in the drive. ARDANWOOD
forward, lodged an early bid between foes, fell back, went back after the winner a second time late in the final turn, no match drive. ANTIGRAVITY bothered
slight at the start, settled off the pace and the inside, evenly paced in the run up the backstretch, four down to three wide in the second bend, getting to the
runnerup late. PA MA'S AMOS bothered at the start, moved out a bit to be four wide through the first turn, continued outside, four again in the second turn,
improved slightly in the drive while not a serious threat. JUNESANDRA off a step slow, tucked in a bit into the first turn, moved closer to the rail in the
second bend, never dangerous through the stretch. COME ON MIKE void of speed while saving ground through the first turn, moved out, three wide through
the second bend, also made little impact through the stretch. CHROME RUN bothered, off slowly, was never close. SOVEREIGN CHANGE broke in to
bother inner foes, pressed early, bid backstretch, stopped..
