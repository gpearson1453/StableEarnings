GOLDEN READY broke in full stride to set all the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best under a brisk hand ride. THE FILTER
pressured the winner from the inside, altered course outside that one at the half mile marker, chased the balance of the pace and held on for second.
BEYOND GONE never far back, swung wide and improved position late. TROPICAL CYCLONE failed to menace. SMASH was hustled along the inside,
had speed into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. CAZMAN trailed.

STORM RISK away alertly, set all the pace while cleverly rated and maintained his advantage under mild urging. IHADADREAM allowed to settle, rallied
determinedly four wide through the stretch and finished clear for second. ADHHAR never far back, surged between horses before a half, chased the winner
into the stretch and faded late. WILLY'S CASTLE well placed, inched closer along the rail into the stretch then leveled off. QUASAR MOON was no factor.
FIRSTHAND JUSTICE well placed, failed to respond. CONDUCIVE was through after a half. WHO DAT MO chased the winner early, stopped on the far
turn, suffered a catastrophic injured entering the stretch and was euthanized.

TIVIS stalked the pace into the stretch, rallied three then two wide to make the lead a furlong out and finished full of run to win as much the best.
ESPLANANDE pressed the pace two wide for a half, led between calls pas the three sixteenths marker then was no match for the winner. ROCK STAR

course four wide near the furlong marker then leveled off. WINE ME UP BABY well placed, failed to respond. SHEZ SHACKED UP made the lead soon
after the start, set a pressured pace along the rail for a half, drifted to the five path and weakened late. ONE GLAMOROUS GAL had good early speed then

JILLY FROM JERSEY chased the pace into the stretch, responded with a burst of speed three wide to make the lead late and won going away. DEVILISH
MAGIC made the lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. CORONELA never far back, finished with good
courage in the six path. SECRET TRICK unhurried early, had a mild late rally in the five path. I GOT THE TIME found her best stride late in the six path.
ROLLIN SO WICKED chased the pace two wide and weakened in deep stretch. LAISSEZ FAIRE had speed into the turn then gave way. REGAL GHOST
had brief speed. MCKINLI'SBABYBLUES trailed.
