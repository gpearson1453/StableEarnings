BREAKTHROUGH set the pace inside, shook off THE KING AQUILES mildly roused in upper stretch, and was in hand through the last eighth of a mile.
THE KING AQUILES pressed the winner from outside to the stretch, could not threaten and held the place. ANDRES EDUARDO bobbled slightly at the
start, raced two wide around the turn, and rallied mildly. CAN'T BE BROKEN was no factor inside. UNCUT GEM broke slowly and trailed inside to the turn,
fanned widest into the lane and had no rally. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT saved ground and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
ISADORABLE AIDA saved ground following the leaders for six furlongs, slid out several paths for clearance in upper stretch, responded readily and kicked
in between horses to edge away. GENERIC MARK steadied in tight and bumped with SASSY JUSTICE first time through the stretch, moved off the rail at
the top of the lane, rallied willingly outside the winner but was outkicked. MISS JEN went along under a firm hold early, came widest for the drive and rallied
with good energy. SASSY JUSTICE bumped with GENERIC MARK early, stayed in range two then three wide to the stretch, rallied to a short lead outside
rivals past the eighth-pole, but was outfinished from there. JOST SAYIN prompted the pace outside YAKO, bid between that one and SASSY JUSTICE in
upper stretch, and was weakening in tight quarters near the finish. YAKO set a slow pace inside to mid stretch, and gave way. TOWA stumbled sharply
unseating the rider at the start, sped around the course out of harm's way, and was escorted off after being apprehended. THERE WERE STEWARDS
INQUIRIES INTO THE START AND THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

ROADHOUSE BLUES bumped with ALLIE AND JAZZY at the start, grabbed the lead and moved inside, shook well clear into the stretch and was kept
busy. DANCING EMPRESS was shuffled back along the inside leaving the half-mile pole, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and rallied
between horses to get the place. OKALANI pursued the pacesetter three wide between horses into the turn, moved in a path with aim at the top of the
stretch, got left in the winner's wake and was outfinished for second. I'M A COCO PEBBLES gave chase four wide for a half-mile, and tired in the stretch.
KERIK showed early speed two wide, and was through before reaching the stretch. ALLIE AND JAZZY bumped with ROADHOUSE BLUES at the start, and
retired early outside.

FIELD DAY pressed the pace two wide, drew off in upper stretch and held clear under left-handed urging. NO QUE NO hit the starting gate to get away last,
was in range inside, angled three wide in upper stretch, could not seriously gain on the winner but held off a foe for the place. ROCKSTAR RO was in range
two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, battled outside of NO QUE NO for second and just missed. MR TINGLES set a pressured pace inside and
weakened in the lane. SKY'S NOT FALLING trailed in the three path.

the others. SHANG'S SISTER stayed in range early, loomed a threat three wide at the top of the stretch, but flattened out. MAP EM UP set the pace inside
to the far turn, and gave way once displaced for command. BEARS BREECHES tired after six furlongs.

Footnotes
ALWAYZ LATE tracked outside the leaders for six furlongs, took over three wide at the top of the stretch, and drew clear under a drive. VIBURNUM settled
in the middle of the field early, swung four wide coming off the far turn, and finished willingly to best the others. MARLBOROUGH ROAD (IRE) saved ground
for six furlongs, moved out approaching the stretch, and was outfinished. RUNAWAY ROCKETTE raced in the second flight to the stretch, and made no
impact. DOUBLE BLESSED was never a factor. TRAFFIC LANE set the pace inside for six furlongs, and gave way. LADY TRAVELER prompted the pace
outside, and had nothing left into the stretch. RUN-UP DISTANCE UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
COLTONSTHEADMIRAL settled off the pace along the inside, advanced two wide around the far turn, split rivals in upper stretch, seized command nearing
the eighth and drove clear. MR. EINSTEIN stumbled after the start, raced off the pace two wide and rallied for the place. FORTY FLASH set the pace along
the rail, dueled inside of BELLA FUTURE while racing a bit off the rail rounding the far turn, bumped with LIAMS STAR nearing the lane, angled three wide
in upper stretch, stayed on the left lead through the stretch and held well enough for the show. LIAMS STAR saved ground in range, made strong progress
at the rail rounding the far turn, tried to squeeze through inside of FORTY FLASH approaching the lane but bumped soundly and was forced to check, had a
clear run through the stretch and lacked any further rally. DOUBLE DAVID tracked the pace three wide and faded in the lane. BELLA FUTURE stalked the
pace two wide, vied outside around the turn and tired in the drive. ARMALITE was at least four wide around the first turn was through after a half. HIGHER
LAW was outrun inside. NEVERMINDNINETYONE played no factor while racing two wide. HEFESTO hesitated at the start and trailed throughout. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEARING THE LANE BUT FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF
FINISH.
