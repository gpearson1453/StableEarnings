Footnotes
ADVENTURE LAND away alertly, set a pressured pace near the inside into the stretch, opened a daylight lead before the furlong marker and lasted under
mild urging. DREAMINOFJUSTICE unhurried early, closed fast in the four path through deep stretch and just missed. ROCKY PARADE allowed to settle,
finished with good courage along the inside. PUNAHELE went evenly. DOLLY DEAR stalked the early pace, improved position into the stretch then came
up empty. TREASURE WILBURNYA was no threat. LAISSEZ FAIRE pressured the winner two wide for a half then stopped.

handed urging. BANKERS BEAST chased the winner into the stretch, dug in determinedly in the four path through the final stages but was too late.
ORBETTE stumbled and was bumped at the start, trailed early then closed willingly through the stretch three wide. PRINCESS AVRIL with the second flight,
went evenly. A LITTLE FLATTERED failed to menace. KUDA HURAA bore out at the start bumping ORBETTE then had brief speed. LOVELY J T flashed
speed then flattened out. TIZ THIRSTY was outrun.

urging and drew clear under a brisk hand ride. CUT RATES never far back, saved ground and got up for second. CHECK OUT LINE stalked the pace three
wide into the stretch, was carried out to the six path and finished determinedly. CANDY LANE sprinted up the inside to make the lead before a quarter, set
the pace into the stretch, drifted to the five path and lost ground. BEST OF YOU failed to menace. STATUS SYMBOL set the early pace, pressured the
leader two wide into the stretch, drifted out then faded. MY LITTLE LILY was no threat. GIFT FROM MOM was no factor.

Footnotes
TICO THUNDER away alertly, set a pressured pace into the stretch, drifted to the six path, shook clear late and just lasted. SEND ME ON under strong
restraint inside for a half, shifted outside entering the far turn, drifted to the middle of the racetrack entering the stretch, swerved under left handed urging in
mid stretch, closed fast and just missed getting up in time. MO DONT NO never far back, loomed boldly four wide into the stretch then was outfinished.
FIRSTHAND JUSTICE stalked the early pace, bid three wide entering the stretch then came up empty. BLACKTIEANDTUX well placed, failed to respond.
DR. ZARNETT pressured the winner two wide into the stretch then weakened late. MOBIL SOLUTION hopped at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LA ALHAMBRA stalked the pace five wide into the turn, closed steadily four wide, made the lead inside the furlong marker and drew clear under a brisk
hand ride. CALTHA stalked the early pace, dropped back in the turn then came on again late in the four path and finished clear for second. CENTRAL
PARKING pressed the pace three then two wide into the turn, made the lead near the quarter pole, maintained a narrow advantage until deep stretch then
was outfinished. FIRST KITTEN close along the inside, was bumped at the seven sixteenths pole, angled out on the turn, swung wide then had a mild late
rally. RAGTIME DOLLY also bumped at the seven sixteenths pole, failed to menace. RENO TOUCH had speed from the start, inched closer five wide on
the turn then came up empty. MISS BETTE LUTE drifted in bumping rivals near the seven sixteenths pole and faded in the stretch. ESTILO DE MUJER with
the second flight five wide, was through after a half. SAINT PATSY was outrun. VALE OF EVESHAM broke in front, set a pressured pace into the turn, had
speed until deep stretch then gave way. PACKIN was bounced around between horsed at the seven sixteenths pole, checked and dropped out of it. SASSY

Footnotes
DELICATE CHRISTY never far back, closed fast in the six path through the final furlong under left handed urging and got up in the final strides. NATALIA'S
TEMPLE dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch, shook clear late and just missed hanging on. TARALLUCCI unhurried early, closed a gap late
in the two path. AZLYNN'S DREAMER allowed to settle, found her best stride late in the seven path. BAREBACK FUN broke awkwardly, rushed up to duel
for the lead two wide before a quarter, battled until deep stretch then was outfinished. DOGWOOD QUEEN with the second flight three wide, failed to
respond. DUCHES OF GRACE broke slowly then failed to menace. PERSONALLY with the second flight four wide, drew closer on the turn then came up
empty. NEVER FOREVER was outrun. BETTER THAN PEARLS was no factor. CLASSY LAURIEANN was hustled along the inside, had speed into the turn
then was used up. TALLY UP was through early.
