Footnotes
WINDCHILL ZAR moved up after breaking near the back, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, shook off the runner-up into
the final furlong, extended the advantage under the crop into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand ride to the wire while much the best. HAWK
TAIL was hustled from the start, contested the pace between horses to the half-mile pole, vied inside on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop,
fought with the winner until the furlong marker then proved no match while extremely clear for the place. JIGSAW BLUE was off slow and spotted the front a
few lengths, raced at the rear while urged along, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker and
lacked the needed response while clear for the show. RONNIE'S REASONING was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the inside of two
opponents, dropped back at the half-mile pole, fell further behind the leaders while inside on the turn and tired. POWERFUL MAN was urged along while
well off the pace, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path and failed to respond. RIVER'S RAGING settled on the outside, was urged three
wide on the turn then driven four wide into the stretch and had nothing left. HEAD-ON REPLAY WAS NOT AVAILABLE

Footnotes
EASY TO BLESS showed good speed from the outside, moved clear inside the half-mile pole, dictated terms in the three path through the turn, was let out
ever so slightly in upper stretch and drew off without being asked to win handily. DIAMOND AND SILKS was urged along on the outside, dropped back
while carried out some leaving the backstretch, dropped in near the three-eighths, angled out sharply in upper stretch and safely secured the place. CABO
SENORITA was off a step slow, raced at the rear while urged along, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then moved
further out, remained on her inside lead until inside the furlong marker before switching to the proper lead and failed to threaten while best of the rest. FAITH
AND FIRE broke very fast then angled in early, showed speed then chased the pace, saved ground on the turn and capitulated. TWIN SISTERS was
carried in early then steadied before being switched out, lugged out some leaving the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn and faltered.

GOOD CLEAN FUN was off slow and spotted the front a fewl lengths, angled in while settling off the pace, saved ground on the turn, gained while cutting
the corner into the stretch, moved out while roused at the three-sixteenths, rallied into the final furlong, closed well to get the lead into the final sixteenth and
prevailed under good handling. PURE VALOR dueled on the outside of a rival, moved clear in the two path leaving the backstretch, responded well when
set down in upper stretch, led under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then was caught while clear for the place. SMART CALL was off slow and spotted the front
a few lengths, raced towards the rear while ridden along, went four then five wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and finished willingly for
the show. NO EXAGGERATION dropped back at the start, was void of speed under urging, saved ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and
showed late energy but failed to threaten. MONEY BIZ was urged along on the outside, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to respond. JAZZ IT

wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, dropped back midway down the backstretch, chased three wide on the far turn, pursued the winner
in the stretch and was clearly second best. OLYMPIC CHAMPION saved ground on the first turn, settled under some urging, went four wide on the far turn,
came seven wide into the stretch and just got up for the show. OWN THE TOWN bumped with a rival at the start while off a couple lengths slow, went three

taken under a tight hold early, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, moved closer midway down the backstretch, rounded the far turn
in the two path, was asked for his best in upper stretch and lacked the needed response then just missed the superfecta. DIRECTIONAL bumped with a
rival at the start while off a couple lengths slow, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer midway down the backstretch, went
three wide on the far turn then came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. LEROY JENKINS went around the first turn in the two path, settled off

front, set the clear pace on the inside, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, dueled with the winner in the final furlong, brushed with that foe outside
the sixteenth-pole, fought gamely while brushing more with that foe in the final sixteenth and just missed while well clear for the place. GASTOWN was last
