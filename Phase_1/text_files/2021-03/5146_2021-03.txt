HAPPY BEE settled back off the rail the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the half mile pole and improved in the four path of the
far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling and took over the final yards. CARROT CAKE was hustled to the lead off the rail and set the pace, came
under more pressure nearing the three eighths pole and raced clear nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in through the lane but was caught flattening stride
the final yards. HURRICANE DIRECTOR rated close to the early pace about the three path, challenged leaving the three eighths pole, dropped back on the
far turn then weakened from the head of the lane. SWEET PIPER raced in the three path the first turn, entered the backstretch outside, though, showed little
response. VEE TEE stalked the early pace inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, faded through the backstretch then eased into the lane.

SLEW THE TURN rounded the first turn about the four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, dueled to the
front two deep approaching the head of the lane, drew clear mid-stretch and widened under steady handling. TAMAQUA rated close toward the inside,
picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the two and three paths of the far turn, then dug in through the lane to take second later
yards. CRYPTOSONDE came away a bit awkwardly and rounded the opening turn about the three path, was well off the pace into the backstretch, bid
nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the seven path and was along for third the final strides. RAVIN' MAVEN entered the opening
turn in the four path then stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, lost ground on the far turn, though, finished
evenly. BARN YARD BRAT rated the pace inside, dueled clear toward the five sixteenths pole, gave up the lead nearest the rail approaching the head of the
lane, continued close in the upper stretch but weakened nearing the sixteenth pole. FIBERTOWN stalked the early pace and took a slim brief lead nearing
the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase past the pole, but checked approaching the quarter and weakened.

CRAZY IDEA raced well back from early contention then bid into the backstretch, progressed steadily and rounded the far turn about the four path, dueled
to the front mid-stretch and inched further ahead of GLAD MOON (GER) through the final sixteenth, while the latter, raced in the three path and stalked into
the backstretch, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead three wide at the quarter and contested the edge through the far turn, but
was caught mid-stretch and relented in later yards. NEW AFLEET rounded the opening two turns about the four path and settled off the pace into the
backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and dug in to take third the final yards. ASTRO RIDER raced with
the pace off the rail and dueled from the seven sixteenths pole, raced between horses into the far turn and contested the turn at a close disadvantage, then
weakened from mid-stretch. MY EMINENCE saved early ground then bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced blocked at the rail most of the far turn,
angled five wide approaching the top of the stretch and finished evenly. BANISHMENT raced with the pace inside and dueled with the advantage from the
seven sixteenths pole, gave up the lead at the rail at the quarter pole then weakened approaching the top of the lane. DYNAFORM raced four wide the first
two turns, entered the backstretch outside and showed little response. FLY E DUBAI rounded the opening turn five wide and stalked from the seven eighths
pole, raced four wide on the second turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded through the backstretch.

CANTAKEITANYMORE raced well off the pace and left the second turn outside, bid steadily from the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead in the three
path approaching the top of the stretch, dueled clear a sixteenth away and widened to the wire. PONT DU GARD rated a slim early lead inside, was headed
at the nine sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, recovered the advantage approaching the five sixteenths, contested the rail on the far turn, was
caught toward the head of the lane, dropped back mid-stretch and had to settle for second best. WASJUANNOWPAUL rated just off the pace inside, started
a three wide bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced close between horses on the far turn, then weakened. EASTPORT settled off the pace in the three
and four paths, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, but lost ground on the far turn and weakened. THE IRON BANK raced well off the
pace and never factored. THE WAYNE FACTOR rated close to the early pace and took a slim lead at the nine sixteenths pole, was caught toward the five
sixteenths, continued a close factor to mid turn, gave way from that point and was eased. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
STROLLNTOTHEBANK chased from the outside, raced five wide on the turn and drifted wider into the stretch but dug in under steady encouragement to
get up the final strides. ADDY'S LOVE contested the pace two deep through the backstretch and took the nod at the quarter pole, dueled with the edge
through the turn and put SPUNKY ALI CAT away inside the sixteenth pole, but was caught in the final strides, while the latter contested the pace inside,
gave up the nod at the quarter pole, dueled at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn and appeared a factor to late stretch before flattening stride.
BELLA FEMMINA gave chase, raced three wide on the turn and finished evenly. MEET MS BOBBI RAE engaged in close chase through the backstretch,
raced in the four and five paths of the turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. LOVIN MACHEN angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the
turn about the seven path and could only close the gap. LITTLE MISS MUFFIN gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and was eased in the lane.
