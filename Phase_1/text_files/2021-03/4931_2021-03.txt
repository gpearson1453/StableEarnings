Footnotes
MISS FLAWLESS (FR) up close early outside the leader, floated out into the stretch, bid outside at the top of the lane and took over in upper stretch then
held gamely over the late bid from the runner-up. CLEARLY GONE settled off the inside, came three wide into the stretch, summoned a late bid but could
not get by. SHERILINDA sped to the front and crossed over to the inside, set the pace from inside, drifted out into the drive, lost command to MISS
FLAWLESS in upper stretch and stayed on to save the show honors. SUGARY stalked between rivals or in the two path, came out on the far turn and
entered the stretch five wide and missed the show. CHARETTE pulled early near the inside, settled along the rail then between rivals on the backstretch,
exited the far turn two wide, kept on through the lane but needed more in the late stages. TIZNO'S DILEMMA pulled early near the inside, saved ground to
the stretch, moved out in the lane and never rallied. HURLEY pulled near the inside first time through the stretch, was rated inside and saved ground to the
lane but lacked further response when called upon. LITTLE BIRD (IRE) took the first turn three wide, remained three wide into the far turn then came four
wide into the stretch and weakened. WIND TARTARE (FR) traveled near the back of the pack outside rivals, went four then five wide around the second
bend and proved no menace.

Footnotes
DR. HOFFMAN got pinballed between rivals at the start, prompted the pace from outside, headed rival at the halfway point and dueled to the five-sixteenths,
kicked clear from that rival and showed the way in the two path into the stretch, drew off in the lane while taking an awkward step late but remained well
clear. TWIRLING DERBY chased three deep early then four deep on the backstretch, angled to the three path around the far turn, could not make an impact
on the winner but was clearly second best. MONGOL ALTAI bumped with inside rival twice in the beginning, traveled five wide into the first turn then angled
to the two path, steered out on the far turn and came five wide into the stretch and summoned a mild rally for the show. PAISANO chased the speed from
inside, angled out leaving the far turn, drifted back inside through the stretch and churned on for a minor award. DERBY WAR angled in on the clubhouse
turn, sat off the pace near the inside, remained along the fence then moved into the two path around the final bend and improved position. TIGER'S SONG
stumbled leaving the gate, raced along the inside into the first turn then moved into the two path around the bend, went between foes on the backstretch,
steered out in the stretch and weakened. LANDAA chased off the inside then three deep, dropped back around the second turn, came four wide into the
lane and tired. LORD VADER broke in then brushed with outside rival, sent for the lead, took control and moved inside, dueled with rival from the half-mile
point to the five-sixteenths, lost contact past that marker and tired. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
IPPODAMIA'S GIRL stalked the pace from inside, angled outside the leader around the far turn, collared foe with a furlong to go and kicked clear. ON
MARS stalked from inside then moved out and tugged her way between rivals on the backstretch, steadied off heels past the three-eighths pole in the two
path then angled to the rail, tipped out in the lane and rallied for the place. MOONHALL MILLY (IRE) angled in and tracked the leader from inside, steadied
briefly at the three-eighths pole, kept inside then moved out a bit leaving that turn, finished willingly and got edged for the place. LAURA'S LIGHT sped clear
and controlled the pace from the inside, remained clear to the stretch then got headed at the eighth pole and yielded. MISS BIGLY stalked the pace off the
inside, lacked room behind weakening rival while between foes on the far turn, switched to the inside and lacked further response. CATCH THE EYE
unhurried in the early going while outside a rival then three deep on the backstretch, chased outside rivals to the stretch and was never a factor. TRICKLE
IN traveled three wide into the first turn then moved into the two path, forwardly placed outside the leader, started to weakened around the far turn and
faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
MISSY P. prompted the pace from outside, remained confidently handled into the stretch, took over and cleared rival approaching the eighth pole, then
powered away in the final furlong while ridden out to the wire. REEM set the pace with MISSY P. to the outside to the lane, was overtaken in upper stretch
and could not go on with the winner inside the furlong grounds but was clearly second best. SHELL SHOCK chased in the two path to the stretch and
outkicked MONGOLIAN PANTHER for the show honors. MONGOLIAN PANTHER broke in, bumped rival and bobbled at the start, chased off the rail then
angled in entering the turn, went two to three wide around the bend and got edged for the show. RIVER GIRL tracked well off the inside up the backstretch,
took the turn five then four wide and could not rally. WILD RIDE threw head and hopped at the start, came four wide into the drive and was never a factor.
RATTRAPANTE bumped by outside rival leaving the gate, asked to be to be forwardly placed early, chased three wide into the stretch, eased in the drive
and walked off.

Footnotes
BURNIN TURF vied between rivals into the first turn then cleared around the bend and angled to the fence, set all the pace to the stretch, urged left-handed
in the lane and remained clear under strong handling. ONE FAST BRO tracked the pace outside a rival, entered the stretch three to four wide, finished
willingly through the lane but could not threaten the winner. KAKISTOCRACY reserved in the early stages, exited the far turn four wide, rallied and gained
the show. HAMMERING LEMON vied for the lead from inside into the clubhouse turn then dropped back to stalk BURNIN TURF from inside or a bit off the
rail, chased two wide into the stretch and flattened. GEORGE HERMAN RUTH settled early along the fence, saved ground and lacked room into the stretch,
steered out in the drive and proved no menace. IT'S FITTING raced off the pace from inside early then moved into the two path, traveled between runners
or two wide around the far turn, tipped out at the top of the lane and never threatened. CROOKED FINGER RAY showed speed outside and vied outside a
pair of rivals early, dropped back to chase the leader and angled into the two path, tracked along the inside through the backstretch, saved ground around
the far turn and weakened.

RATHER NOSY set the pace inside a pair of rivals, cleared near the three-eighths pole and inched away around the turn, then drew off through the drive
under mild asking and ridden out late. SAVING SOPHIE settled off the pace, traveled two wide then moved out on the turn, came five wide into the stretch,
rallied and nailed FLAT OUT JOY for the place. FLAT OUT JOY pressed the pace from outside, chased the leader two then three wide around the turn and
got nailed for second. BALLET DE COUR chased off the rail then in the two path, saved ground from inside to the stretch and weakened. BLAZING CHARM
lacked early speed, traveled along the inside then two wide and failed to make an impact. DIM LIGHTS away quickly from outside, showed early speed
outside the top pair, chased three to four wide on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
DISAPPEARING ACT settled off the rail then angled in first time through the stretch, came off the rail into the drive, rallied three deep at the eighth pole and
proved best late. WITCH MOON chased from inside then moved into the two path, came out on the final bend and entered the stretch five wide, bid four
deep at the furlong marker and finished gamely outside the winner. MIDNIGHT DIVA stalked from inside, angled out around the final turn, took aim three
wide into the stretch, bid between at the eighth pole and got outkicked. ARISTEIA was rank crossing over the dirt surface in the early stages, vied for the
lead first time through the stretch then cleared inside rival, led in the two path then moved inside, led in the two path into the stretch, held a short lead with a
furlong to go and yielded to the top trio. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU shifted out entering the stretch the first time then shifted back inside shortly after, tracked two
wide then a bit off the rail into the stretch and lacked a rally. LADY CROCKER showed early speed staying off the rail, vied with rival for command first time
through the stretch then chased that foe into the clubhouse turn, started to weaken at the quarter pole, got shuffled between rivals into the stretch and
weakened. LAKAYA raced off the pace, saved ground through the turns and was never a factor. IN THE WIND was off slow to begin, moved to the inside
and never got involved. RAIL ON HILL AT ZERO.

Footnotes
CANADIAN PRIDE set the pace with company to the outside, cleared that rival on the backstretch then inched away leaving the turn, kept to task under with
right-handed encouragement and held well. I WILL NOT bumped from the outside at the start, stalked up the backstretch, traveled two wide then tipped out
in upper stretch and gained ground on the winner in the final sixteenth. COLT FICTION stalked outside a rival or off the inside, went three to four wide
through the turn then finished willingly outside the top pair. HOWBEIT tracked off the rail, went two wide or outside a rival on the turn and kept on through
the lane for a minor share. ADARE broke in and bumped rival, entered the turn five wide, moved into the four path then back out five wide into the lane and
lacked a bid. SINGLE ME OUT saved ground around the bend and never made an impact. DEUCE stumbled leaving the gate, pressed the issue early then
chased the leader two then three wide around the turn and tired in the late stages.
