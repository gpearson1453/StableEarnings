Footnotes
TRUMP UM was hustled early to contest the early lead, advanced position along the turn while saving ground, dueled with CARTELLATE at the head of the
stretch, put away that rival and won in a drive. HOT ENCOUNTER settled just off of the early pace, was three wide coming off of the turn, advanced position
in the stretch, put in a late rally but was not catching TRUMP UM. ARNO'S MANE MAN was unhurried early, settled toward the rear of the field while saving
ground, angled out at the head of the stretch for racing room, went between horses for a late surge but was not able to catch the top two. CARTELLATE
was used early to contest the opening speed, stalking the leader from the two path along the turn, was asked for run in the drive but was outinished. KID
ARCADE had no early speed, saved ground at the rear of the field through the turn and had no late bid for the stretch.

TIME IS GONE vied for the early lead, slipped onto the rail for the turn, was set down for the drive and gamely held off AMERICAN BUDDHA for the win.
AMERICAN BUDDHA sat just off of the early pace, settled along the rail on the turn, was angled out for the stretch drive and was gaining on TIME IS GONE
but could not reel in that rival. THEY'RE GRRREAT sat just off of the early pace, advanced position while two wide along the turn, was asked for run in the
stretch and had no late bid. TWO PUNCH CAT settled at the rear of the field through the early going, improved position while coming three wide off of the
turn but could not sustain that bid through the stretch. BIG IRISH EYES sat close to the early pace, was between horses while two wide through the turn,
ran up on THEY'RE GRRREAT's heels in the early stretch drive and had no late run in the stretch.

Footnotes
MAYCEE JO sat just off of the early pace, maintained a two wide position on the turn and into the stretch, confronted GALWALKSINTOABAR and wore
down that rival in the final sixteenth to win in a drive. GALWALKSINTOABAR was hustled early to set pace, saved ground through the turn, was headed by
MAYCEE JO in the stretch, dug in briefly while running on the left lead but could not muster a late bid for the win. MISS SKI unhurried early while saving
ground at the rear of the field, began a sustained bid at the top of the stretch and passed tiring foes for third. FAMILY TRIPS settled early while maintaining
a two wide position along the turn, gained position along the turn but weakened in the drive. DARLING DEMON vied for the early lead with
GALWALKSINTOABAR, lost position into the turn while saving ground, and had no response for the stretch drive.

STALKING SHADOW stalked the early fractions from a ground saving trip, gained position along the second turn, dueled with OMPH and held off that rival
in the late stages to kick clear. OMPH sat early fractions from a two wide trip, lost position to STALKING SHADOW along the turn, continued to battle that
rival in the stretch but was outfinished. BOBBY'S ALIBI was two wide along the first turn and backstretch while close to the pace, lost position along the
second turn and into the stretch then was outfinished in the final furlong. J T'S WATCH settled at the rear of the field early while saving ground, advanced
position along the second turn and could not offer the needed late response. DEALERS HAND settled midpack while three wide along the backstretch and
second turn, lost position coming into the stretch and weakened for the stretch drive. WYNNVILLE settled toward the rear of the field early while four wide,
lost position along the turn and tired in the stretch.

GRAZEN ROAD pressed the leader to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, dueled to mid stretch then edged clear driving. DON'T RUB IT never
far back for a half mile, rallied four wide on the second turn, loomed a threat to mid stretch then could not stay with the winner. STEIN'S GIRL was outrun for
a half mile, raced three wide to the stretch then was making up ground belatedly. PASSIONATE ROAD had no speed, made a mid race bid while circling
five wide on the second turn but flattened out in the final furlong. BIG AWARD also had no speed, settled to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch but
failed to threaten in the drive. ASPEN AGAIN was chasing to the second turn, raced off the rail to the stretch then weakened in mid stretch. FRONT
BURNER lagged to the second turn, saved ground but was never a factor. ALWAYS FOR MONEY was chasing for a half mile then saved ground on the
second turn but gave way in the drive. DAISY FIELD hustled to set the pace for five furlongs then tired and stopped in the stretch.
