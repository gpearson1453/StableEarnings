KYNANCE (IRE) trailed early while confidently handled, circled the field five wide past the quarter pole and cleared off as much the best. ROGUE TOO
broke well inside, chased to far turn, rallied into the stretch while clearly best of the rest. FROND sat in perfect position to far turn, came with a three wide
run for show spot. ELEGANT DE DOMINO raced evenly throughout with no late gain in the stretch run. BE NIMBLE inside trip to quarter pole but weakened
in the stretch run. JEANNIE'S BEEPBEEP sprint clear, collared into the far turn and gave way readily. CHART stalked pace to far turn with a mild bid past
the quarter pole but stopped abruptly in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SUGAR DIVA inside chase to turn, roused into the stretch, vigorous handling in the final furlong and wore down leader in the final stages. MARGARET
DRIVE quick inside speed, set pace to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly late. APSARA had a slow start, unhurried to the turn, rallied wide in the stretch
for the show spot. CUPP OF CLASS raced evenly to the stretch with no late kick when needed. LOVE'S TAVITO raced close up outside throughout but
used up and came up empty in the lane. DIANNA'S JET had a slow start inside, far back to the turn and only improved position widest. SIRCAT NELLY
raced close to turn with nothing left for the drive. BICKERMENTS never a menace. MOONLIGHT KISS failed to contend. NIAGARA'S DIVA chased outside
to turn but emptied out in the stretch run. MISS SKY CAT never close.
