Footnotes
AUSTRALASIA was bumped on both sides at the start, came out and bumped with a foe into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, prompted the pace
while loosely between horses, turned up the pressure on the leader in the three path on the far turn, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, battled
outside of the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong then drew clear under strong urging. WINNING ROMANCE went to the front, set the pace in the
two path through quick fractions, vied in the two path under pressure on the far turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole, battled with the winner under a
drive into the final furlong then proved no match while clear for the place. BIG TIME was restless in the gate, broke out and bumped with a foe, was taken in
hand when the leader crossed in front early, settled nicely on the inside, was asked on the far turn, moved off the rail before the five-sixteenths, turned into
the stretch in the three path under a drive and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. EILEEN ALEXANDRA bumped with a rival into the first
turn, went four wide on that bend, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the four path on the far turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop and
tired. TECATE TIME was bumped at the start then taken up shortly thereafter, dropped well behind while in the two path and trailed throughout.

late then bumped with the runner-up and prevailed. MASQUEPARADE contested the pace on the outside while in the three path, took over near the
five-sixteenths, was put to a drive into upper stretch, fought on well with the winner into the final furlong, battled with two foes into the final sixteenth, came

the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. BUNKIE'S SONG was away alertly, chased the early pace, dropped back late on the

hand ride to prevail. WIN WORTHY bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging with a
half-mile to run, advanced four wide on the far turn, took the lead inside the five-sixteenths, dropped to the three path while moving clear into the stretch, lost

was reserved towards the rear then shuffled back some behind SNOW HOUSE leaving the backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path early on the far
turn, shifted four wide late on that bend then came five wide into the stretch, gained into a good striking position under a drive but flattened out and settled
for the show. SNOW HOUSE was taken in hand early, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, was rated under a snug hold, dropped back leaving the
backstretch, went two then three wide on the far turn, came between rivals in upper stretch, dropped in into the final furlong and finished willingly.

then edged clear under steady urging. PLAYED HARD disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was put to a drive while in front in
upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. ONLY KIDDING chased the pace on the
outside then four wide on the turn, pursued the top two under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. A REAL JEWEL was
well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. SEASCAPE broke out and bumped with a rival, was urged along on the outside,
went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to rally. SYMPTOM raced towards the rear, went around the
turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch then moved further out, drifted out near the furlong marker and failed to threaten.
FIRINGTOTHEFRONT bumped with a rival at the start and was off a bit slow, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in at the
three-sixteenths and was no factor. BOLD CONFECTION disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back in upper

CLASSY JOHN pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked while on even terms for the lead at the five-sixteenths, dueled
gamely with the runner-up in the stretch and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. X CLOWN broke out but came out clearly in front, disputed the pace on
the inside of the winner, dueled gamely with the winner in the stretch and was denied while able to get the place. MONTE MAN broke out and was off a
half-step slow, settled near the middle of the field, rounded the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch, angled out at the eighth-pole, rallied
outside in the final furlong and closed well to just miss while up for the show. NO PAROLE broke a half-step behind the body of the field but over a length
behind X CLOWN, was unable to get the lead when that foe crossed in front, settled just off the pace, moved out leaving the backstretch, was asked three
wide on the turn, chased four wide into the stretch, made an outside bid into the final furlong but was out-kicked. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY bumped with a rival
early, settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick. AFLEET ASCENT broke a
step slow then bumped with a rival, bumped with foes on both sides early, settled towards the rear, was held up in the two path behind WIN LION WIN on
the turn, swung six wide while roused into the stretch and finished with good energy. YANKEE SEVEN bumped with a foe early, was reserved off the pace,
went three wide for most of the turn then dropped to the two path and gained but failed to menace. A SONG FOR ARCH bumped with a rival at the start,
tracked the pace on the outside, was carried out some leaving the backstretch, chased four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and weakened.
FAME FEATHER bumped with a rival at the start, settled towards the rear on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, swung seven wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. WIN LION WIN bumped with a rival early, settled towards the rear, was taken in hand late on the backstretch then lugged out
some into the turn, moved from the inside to the three path on that bend, swung five wide into the stretch and was no factor.

COLONEL LIAM was taken in hand while carried in early then reserved in mostly the two path, ranged up on the far turn, made a three wide bid at the
quarter-pole, took the lead under a drive just inside the three-sixteenths, fought with the runner-up to the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under steady
urging. TWO EMMYS showed early speed, was taken in hand while carried in early then moved back up to take the lead, set the pace in the two path,
controlled the action through the far turn, lost the lead under a drive inside the three-sixteenths, battled with the winner to the sixteenth-pole then was
outfinished while clear for the place. LOGICAL MYTH went four wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, raced three wide on the far turn, was
roused at the quarter-pole and lacked the needed kick while just up for the show. PIXELATE went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the front on
the outside, was asked four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. NINETY ONE ASSAULT was taken up
early when foes crossed in front from the outside then was placed under a strong hold, saved ground while reserved off the pace, came under a drive in
upper stretch and also lacked the needed response. CAPTIVATING MOON went thee wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two
path on the far turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and failed to rally. PEACE ACHIEVED angled in while showing early speed, saved ground on the first
turn, tracked off the inside on the backstretch, chased three wide on the far turn then spun four wide into the stretch and tired. CONVICTION TRADE broke
a bit slow, went five wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, went three wide under urging on the far turn, floated eight wide into the stretch and was
no factor. SPOOKY CHANNEL was taken under a tight hold early, went four wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging while four
wide on the far turn, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. OLYMPIC RUNNER was rank under restraint nearing the first turn then lugged out
six wide into the bend before dropping to five wide, settled towards the rear, was urged four wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. THREE-QUARTER

that foe nearing the sixteenth-pole, was given one pop of a left-handed crop while clear late and proved best. MIDNIGHT BOURBON prompted the pace on
the outside in the three path, was asked in the four path into the stretch, battled outside of the winner into the final furlong, dropped back into the final
