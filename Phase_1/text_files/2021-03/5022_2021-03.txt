LET'S GET STARTED raced well off the early pace about the three path, bid into the backstretch and came through the far turn in the three and four paths,
dug in leaving the far turn to take over later yards and inched ahead of TWENTYTWENTY, who rated a slim lead inside, was met by Mojo's Louie Cat into
the backstretch and dueled to turn that one back midway on the far turn, picked up the challenge of Let's Get Started inside the sixteenth pole and relented
to that on late yards. PONTICELLO stalked the pace from the three path, picked up the chase into the backstretch, raced in the four path on the far turn and
was along for third mid-stretch. MOJO'S LOUIE CAT stalked two deep, challenged at even terms into the backstretch and dueled from that point, but
dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened stride in the lane. CRISTIANO BOY rated close to the early pace then picked up the chase into the
second turn, challenged four wide at the half mile pole then faded into the far turn. ROCKET COLONY saved early ground then ran in the four path of the
second turn, raced close four wide into the backstretch but faded past the three eighths pole. YOUCANTFIXSTUPID saved early ground and was through
after seven sixteenths.

SECRET AFFIRMATION was crowded on the chute then challenged nearing the three eighths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn,
drove to the lead mid-stretch and inched clear of BEST TO BE ME through later yards, while the latter took over at the half mile pole and rated the early
pace, came under pressure from the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn but was caught mid-stretch and relented later
yards. INDIAN FIBER angled in on the chute then picked up the chase, raced at the rail on the turn and finished evenly. LOVE HAPPY gave chase outside,
rounded the turn about the three path and finished evenly. GINGER IN DISGUISE was crowded on the chute then picked up the chase inside, steadied at
the rail leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little more. ROSALENE was crowded on the chute, gave chase through the
backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path.

Footnotes
REILTIN OIR steadied midway on the opening turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the
four path of the far turn, dueled to the lead later yards and ran clear under the wire. SAINTE THERESE rounded the opening turn about the five path then
stalked into the backstretch, took the lead nearing the three eighths pole and dueled clear of Vintage Gin approaching the quarter pole, widened at the rail
on the far turn and dug in under steady handling through the lane, but was caught later yards and just held on for second. FRENCH NOUGET saved early
ground then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn, dug in from the top of the stretch and finished strong to take third the
final strides. VINTAGE GIN rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole but was caught toward the three eighths, gave
chase from that point, dropped back approaching the quarter pole then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. CAPTAIN ANNE rounded the first turn in the five
path and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, was carried to the seven path on the far turn and showed little
more. ENDUROS TIGRESS entered the opening turn about the four path then saved ground midway on the turn, gave chase into the backstretch, raced
near the rail on the far turn then weakened. NANCYSAIDSO was checked attempting to bear out into the first turn and raced well off the pace into the
backstretch, showed little response then drifted on the far turn.

BLACK CANDY closed to the lead nearing the three eighths pole, came under pressure past the quarter and rounded the turn at the rail, then held on well
under steady stretch handling. BARNSTORM gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn in the five and six paths, finished strong to take second later
yards and was gaining on the winner. GRAND FIBER gave chase and raced near the rail on the turn, finished evenly, though, outfinished for second the
final yards. REATA'S CASTLE chased toward the inside, rounded the turn off the rail and ran evenly through the lane. MY TIME IN COURT gave chase and
raced close off the rail most of the turn, but drifted into the lane and weakened the final furlong. BOLD VALOR led most of the opening three sixteenths of a
mile then gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced in range of the lead off the rail on the turn, was eased to the four path into the stretch then
weakened. RICARDITO saved ground on the turn.

Footnotes
PERSEVERED took quick control to rate the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail, then
dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. RIGHTEOUS RENEGADE settled off the pace about the three path, challenged leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and raced close through the far turn, drifted a bit into the stretch but dug in down the lane to narrow the gap. DESTINY'S CHARGE saved
ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed little more. GOOFY BOY raced off the pace about
the four path, challenged three wide nearing the seven sixteenths pole but faded past the three eighths. CASTLEFINN saved ground off the pace then faded
through the backstretch. STROLLANOTHERTIME stalked the early pace but was taken up and eased after a half mile, then walked off post race.
