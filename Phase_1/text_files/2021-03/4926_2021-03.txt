Footnotes
BOUNTY OF GOLD broke well and quickly took command on the backstretch, entered turn clear and maintained clear advantage into the stretch, never
threatened in the stretch and finished well being ridden out. SLIGHTLY chased leader three wide on the backstretch, entered turn three wide on the turn,
floated out a lane late in the turn and into the stretch in the four path, rallied well under hand ride to be second best. MADAME JEANETTE bumped a couple
times with inside rival at the start, chased leader in between rival on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, prompted late in the turn and drifted
out into the three path, entered stretch in the three path and held show. THE PET bumped twice at the start, kept trying to get out on the backstretch, took
turn fine along the inside, entered stretch and resented the prompting of rider and bucked at the sixteenth pole, rider stayed on and got back into stride to
finish fourth. CUTE TALKER saved ground on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside, attempted to go around rival on the turn and floated out into
the four path, lacked bid in the stretch. SUGARATSUNDOWN came out at the start three paths, stalked leaders well off the rail on the backstretch,
continued off the rail on the turn and lacked bid in the stretch.
