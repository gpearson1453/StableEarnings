Footnotes
THE BIGGEST ONE set the pace along the rail, shrugged off a bid from the runner-up near the quarter pole and widened under a drive. FLYING BLACK
pressed the winner two wide, bid nearing the lane, was no match in upper stretch but stayed on to be a clear second. EVERTHREE hesitated at the start,
raced off the pace two wide around most of the turn, angled four wide near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally while tending to lug in through the
stretch. EXAGGERATED MOMENT was up close inside and faded in the lane. JEDI JANE stalked the top two three wide and came up empty in the drive.
FROSTED MISTRESS was outrun while racing four wide. BOBBIES hit the starting gate and was never close while racing inside. WATCH ME TANGO was
pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
CALIBRATOR took control after an alert beginning, rated along inside to the stretch, came out late under left-hand pressure and held for the decision.
OCEANS MAP moved through between horses to force the pace after a half-mile, got shaken off after six furlongs, then stayed on with good courage
outside the winner. CASANOVA KITTEN saved ground behind the leaders around the far turn, moved out in upper stretch looking to get through between
OCEANS MAP and CALIBRATOR, steadied behind the latter past the sixteenth pole and saved the show while being gathered up. HIGH TIDE broke a step
slowly and trailed early inside, swung four wide into the stretch and gained mildly outside. TURN OF EVENTS was slow into stride, raced near the inside
throughout and lacked a closing response. SAMARONTI prompted the pace three wide, and tired after six furlongs. TEMPLET was strung out four wide
through the far turn, and gave way into the lane. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF CASANOVA KITTEN FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

TOO SEXY settled two wide off the pace, angled three wide turning for home, closed outside and was up in the final strides. MUMBAI set a clear pace
inside, drifted out a bit in upper stretch straightened out and led until the final strides under mild urging. LET THEM EAT CAKE lacked early speed, raced
two wide and rallied for the show. MACKENZIE'S GIRL chased the pace inside, tipped out turning for home and lacked a closing bid. BREEHAZEL failed to
menace while racing three wide. ANYTHING GOES steadied just after the start, saved ground and never threatened. ORIOLE played no factor while racing
three wide.

Footnotes
EMOLGA advanced around the turn four wide, took over outside SHELLPHONE through the furlong grounds and edged away under pressure.
SHELLPHONE sprinted clear early, was put to an all-out drive outside the quarter-pole in the two-path, could not handle the winner in mid stretch but stayed
on for second. NATIONALIST saved ground taking closer order at the top of the stretch, but flattened out on the rail. SIMPLE STORY improved position four
then three wide around the turn, but faded in the stretch. DINNER AT FIVE raced in striking range early three wide, but was finished leaving the turn.
CAPTURED LIGHT bobbled slightly at the start, and was always outrun. TWILIGHT GALAXY prompted the early pace, retreated steadily around the turn,
was pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

PROPER MANNERS saved ground in midpack, had a clear run through inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch, seized command approaching the eighth
pole and quickly drew clear under a drive. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT bumped with FAST CATALINA at the start, steadied off heels entering the first turn,
raced well back two and three wide and rallied between foes in the lane. HENNI PENNY raced three and four wide in midpack and had a mild stretch rally.
SAMMY'S TOWN chased the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and was one-paced through the lane. FOLLOW ME MOM set the pace
in the two path and tired in the final furlong. FAST CATALINA bumped with CHARLOTTE THE BRIT at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. HY
DOLLFACE was outrun inside. AKOR played no factor while racing four wide. MS HEADLEY pressed the pace in the three path and retreated through the
lane.

Footnotes
NEW YORK STYLE put a head in front inside rivals just before going a quarter-mile, shook off his closest pursuers turning for home and remained in
command under a drive. ENANO ASTRAY loomed menacingly four then three wide approaching the stretch, got shaken off just inside
NEVERSTOPDREAMING, then got the place after a long battle with the latter. NEVERSTOPDREAMING pressed the early pace between horses, could not
stay with NEW YORK STYLE once straightened away for the drive, and was outfinished for the runner-up spot. VALID EXCHANGE moved off the inside
after a half-mile, and could not gain through the lane. MR TITO'S broke a step slow, swung five wide coming off the turn, and could not threaten. DEPUTY
CZAR was outsprinted two wide for a half, moved inside through the stretch and made no headway. ULTRACONFIDENT broke slowly and was always
outrun. NORTHBROOK vied early outside NEW YORK STYLE and NEVERSTOPDREAMING, and was through after a half.

Footnotes
FOREVER MO settled off the pace along the inside, swung five wide turning for home, closed outside, took the lead near the sixteenth and edged ahead
under a drive. HIGH NOON RIDER lagged well back inside, swung widest in upper stretch and finished strongly. MOROCCO was in range two wide, tipped
three wide nearing the lane, bid between foes but was outkicked. THUNDER RIDE set the pace along the rail, led to the sixteenth pole, drifted out under
right-handed urging leaving that marker and weakened. GEMONTEER saved ground in range, was one-paced in upper stretch, steadied near the sixteenth
pole and lacked a clear path late. BLIND AMBITION pressed the pace two wide and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
PREVALENCE broke outward but came away with the leaders, was content to sit just outside TIO MAGICO up the backstretch, took over after six furlongs
going comfortably, widened through the stretch under a mild drive, then was urged to continue on for an eighth of a mile or so after the finish. SOUTHERN
PASSAGE broke out making light contact with CAXAMBAS CANDY, lagged well back early inside, moved off the rail finding his best stride past the
eighth-pole and finished well. TIO MAGICO set the pace slightly removed from the rail, was no match for the winner once set down in earnest turning for
home, and was overtaken late for second. CAXAMBAS CANDY received a light bump from SOUTHERN PASSAGE at the break, stayed close to the far turn
while moving steadily outward, was under an all-out drive coming to the quarter-pole outside the leaders, made no further progress and faded. DISTORTED
LIMITS was forwardly placed early, and could not keep pace around the turn three wide. SLASHING was finished after a half-mile.

CHARGE ACCOUNT saved ground in midpack, steadied entering the first turn and again midway around the bend, swung four wide midway around the far
turn, surged to the front, drew clear in midstretch, drifted out under right-handed urging and held sway. KITTEN'S ROMANCE broke out and bumped LEA
RO into GYPSY at the start, raced two wide in midpack around both turns, angled out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and rallied inside of the
winner. LEA RO stalked the pace two wide, reached even terms near the quarter pole, battled on inside the winner but was outkicked. GYPSY WIFE was
bumped at the start, saved ground well back, advanced five wide around the far turn, steadied near the quarter pole and ran on while not threatening the
lane. LITTLE BIT GOOD failed to menace while racing two wide. LOVELY BROWN chased the pace two and three wide and faded in the lane. OMNIA set
the pace along the rail and tired in the drive. FALL MOON saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
FUTURE VICTORY was taken out four wide midway on the first turn, remained in that path edging closer to the leaders a quarter-mile out, kicked in to
reach the front from outside past the furlong marker and drove clear. LUMBERJACK got forced out by ALADO into the first turn, pressed the pace outside
rivals to the stretch, and stayed on gamely. INDOCTRINATE was nursed along on a short lead inside rivals to the stretch, fought back against several
challengers turning for home, and saved the show on the rail. DIMENNA lunged outward coming out of the gate, pressed the pace outside INDOCTRINATE
to the stretch, and was outfinished. ALADO got out while hard to handle into the first turn, stayed in range to the stretch, and lacked a closing response.
EAMONN was unsettled under a firm hold behind the early leaders, saved ground into the lane, and faded through the late stages. WILL TAKE CONTROL
raced three to four wide, and lacked the needed rally. THRUSTER steadied off DIMENNA at the start, went four to five wide around the far turn, and failed to
menace. LORD FLINTSHIRE lagged toward the back throughout, and made no headway in the stretch on the far outside. BIG CITY DREAMS saved ground
to no avail. BIG SNITCH steadied back at the start, and trailed inside.
