Footnotes
SAINT SELBY took up residence in midpack on the backstretch, slid into the pocket approaching the half mile pole, got called upon angling to the outside
leaving the five-sixteenths marker, completed the maneuver in the three path at the head of the stretch and took off in earnest after the one to catch,
willingly moved towards the middle of the strip, reacting to the wayward ways on display by the second place finisher between midlane and the sixteenth
pole, ground his way toward that one afterwards as both assumed truer courses, getting the job done in the last jump. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE attained a
forward position, stepped onto the turn from the three path, hitched up to B C GLORY DAYS just as GRAY QUEST was beginning to back away, this
occurring midpoint on the turn, was more in the two path taking it to the leader as the twosome headed home, grabbed away the advantage, reacted in a
negative way as the pilot was applying the stick for a sixteenth beginning from around the eighth pole, eventually wandering out into path four, went
straighter in the last sixteenth, digging in all the while, got nipped. B C GLORY DAYS along the inside route, got engaged in a pair of separate duels, the
second of which involved ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE, got headed in the furlong grounds, stayed on rather well salvaging the show. FORTY TWO ACE
pursued the pace three to four wide during the run around the bend, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, venturing onward as the widest of all,
had no closing punch. GHOSTMON broke without apparent mishap, entered the turn from the two path, went over to the rail during the early stages of the
stretch drive, made no headway. CHIEF ASHAROKEN away approximately three lengths the tardiest, strode out greenly heading for the top of the
backstretch, left it from along the rail, cut the corner into the lane and improved. A COLT NAMED SUSIE inched over to the rail on the backstretch,
abandoned it by shifting out three wide into the stretch, lacked the necessary response. GREY QUEST pressed the issue two wide for a half, folded.

Footnotes
VITANZA coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch, tipped three wide through the turn advancing on the front and coming under
coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to steadily gain through the final furlong getting up in the
last jumps to the finish to prevail. LOVE ME TOMORROW brushed at the start by JARA, who broke outwards, prompted the pace three then two wide while
outside the leader CHARLOTTE WEBLEY, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, took over command near the eighth pole,
dug in all out to fend off the aforementioned foe but was collared in the final strides. EMPRESS LUCIANA four then three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole, went four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. JARA broke out at the start brushing
LOVE ME TOMORROW, chased just off the inside until tucked briefly inside half a mile from home before taking back to the two path through the turn
placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. MISS CHARISMA chased
inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and
passed tired rivals. CHARLOTTE WEBLEY coaxed from the gate, crossed over to show the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn
coming under increasing pressure to the outside, cut the corner into upper stretch, got roused straightened away, dug in and yielded nearing the eighth pole,
then weakened through to the finish. QUEENDOM three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and
made no impact. SYZYGY four paths off the inside early on, tucked to the two path into the turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung three to four
wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
AUNT KAT got engaged with STRAFE nearly from the get-go, was the more-confidently ridden of that match up, being coaxed along from the inside route,
edged away from the nemesis after the second split had been posted, was approaching the three-sixteenths pole when let out, extended the margin in rapid
order during the ensuing furlong, appeared to be in total command when geared down for the final sixteenth. BACK CHANNEL pursued the pace from the
two path, got asked to pick it up crossing the midway point of the turn, got sent out into path four during the early stages of the stretch, finished a
non-threatening second. ALPINE QUEEN travelled two wide until the end of the bend, was closer to the rail stepping into the stretch, ventured on to be
along for the show. VENUS OYZO three wide and under a ride on the turn, angled towards path five for the drive, lacked the needed response. STRAFE
sparred with the winner from the two path, pulling a bit on the right, gave way. HANDLE THE TRUTH quickly planted along the rail, went on to save ground
to no avail.

Footnotes
HEAVY ROLLER chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three wide into upper stretch, rallied to poke a head in front a
furlong from home, edged clear under a drive to prevail. MINE THE COIN brushed at the start by SCARF IT DOWN, who broke outwards, established the
front and showed the way in hand along the inside coming under some pressure midway on the turn, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch,
dug in under lone threat and was collared a furlong out, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. PLAYWRIGHT chased
five wide throughout coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and improved position to garner the show honors. MAC'S
REVOLUTION pulled early on under a firm hold before settling inside in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside
route into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the furlong grounds, then weakened in the late stages. HARDCORE FOLKLORE chased three then four
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. HERO'S HOPE three wide in pursuit in range of the
front, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. SCARF IT DOWN broke out at the start brushing MINE THE
COIN, prompted that rival from the two path to the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired. ORPHEUS (ARG)
chased four wide under coaxing from midway on the turn and tired. HAWAIIAN NOISES showed brief speed just off the inside before backing away nearing
the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
STORM ADVISORY in awkwardly with his initial step, made contact the second place finisher, took up position in midpack, tracked the front runners from
just off the rail, got worked into path four from upper to midstretch, closed the gap, struck the front with approximately a sixteenth to go and kicked clear.
FOX RED went to on to spar for command from the two path after bumping with the winner in the shadow of the starting gate, got called upon for the drive,
inched away, only to begin the final furlong under aim by STORM ADVISORY, yielded in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, held on well to earn the place.
SHAMROCKED put to a hand ride leaving the gate, remained under similar encouragement vying for command along the inside route, went the opening
half directly abreast of the runner up, came under a drive a short distance from the end of the bend, kept pace for a little while longer then weakened in the
show slot. THE GREAT DANSKY chased the pace from path four, was in the same one in upper stretch, made no headway. CAVARADOSSI two wide onto
the turn, lacked a response. BATTERBATTERSWING under a hand ride in the three path eyeing on the ongoing pace dispute, got sent out in the direction
of path six from upper to midstretch, backed away. BRUSH COUNTRY cut over to the rail nearing the half mile pole, never made its presence felt. SWIPING
DAN stumbled at the start, recovered, brought up the back of the pack saving ground for the opening half, entered the stretch then wandered six wide
basically under his own power.

DEVIOUS MO vied four then three wide outside a pair down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn pinching the backing away BEING ME very
lightly inside that station, took over sole command and shook off his other pace rival three furlongs from home and was loosely confronted by the runner up
through the latter portion of the turn while patiently handled, took the inside route into upper stretch and was roused straightened away, went clear under a
drive, the rider peeking back twice to the off side around the eighth pole, then got geared down through the final sixteenth to the finish, the outcome in no
doubt. BAR FOURTEEN four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top one and ran on to secure the place honors well clear of the rest to be along second best. ROYAL KAZ coaxed from the gate, vied inside a
pair, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and was shaken off, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired while along for the show honors.
LADY'S BOY chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. PRODUCTION CREDIT chased four
then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BUSTIN BIEBER chased just off
the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. ALITE chased two to three wide under
coaxing from midway on the turn, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. BEING ME hustled from the gate, vied from the two path between
foes, began to get shaken off half a mile from home and was lightly pinched and forced to be taken in hand as DEVIOUS MO tucked in a path from the
outside, retreated through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, went three wide for home and faltered. ST. PADDY'S BOY chased five wide
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled in to spin three wide into upper stretch and trailed.

TIZ KAZ NOW stalked the pace from path two, saw POSSE CAN DISCO inch away at the half was being completed, settled in upper stretch and was given
its cue, continued to watch the leader steadily extend the margin, began to close the gap about a sixteenth down the road though, forged on ahead rallying
with VICTORY BUILT, poking a head in front with a few jumps to spare to get the job done. VICTORY BUILT took up position in midpack, pursued the front
runners from the two path, was under a drive turning into the stretch, altered course towards the four path in midlane, hitched up to the top one, rallied in
unisom with that opponent in the final stages, fell short. POSSE CAN DISCO cut over to the inside with the advantage, showed the way, tailed by the winner
from the outside, had the pilot cast a confident look back at the closest contenders approaching the quarter pole, got called upon for more, left the eighth
pole having built up what turned out to be its largest lead, felt the presence of the top twosome with under a sixteenth to go, got nailed in the shadow of the
finish line. SCORPION DYNASTY underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, spun about as wide into the lane, mustered up a mild response sufficient
enough to lay claim to the last major check. GRATTO SWING strung out three wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, backed
away in the last eighth. MR. FIDGET slow to settle, took the inside route on the turn, got sent out five wide from upper to midlane, never made his presence
felt. MUCHO SUNSHINE sighted three wide at the three-eighths pole, launched no bids. HUDSON OVERPASS pocketed, faltered.

Footnotes
MIHOS chased along the inside coming under urging three furlongs from home, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, closed well outside through the
final furlong taking command inside the final sixteenth and inched away to the finish to prevail. SECRET RULES four then three wide in aim of the front,
tucked to the two path through the turn advancing put to coaxing to take command at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under
threat and was caught inside the final sixteenth, ran on to secure the place honors. BIG ENGINE chased along the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. RUNNINGWSCISSORS four to five paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. MUSICAL AMERICA chased two to three wide coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch,
offered up a bid to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late going. HIGH VELOCITY showed the way in hand three then two wide until tucked inside half a
mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths headed for the front, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. CELTIC CHAOS grew detached
at the tail of the field four paths off the inside when devoid of speed early, chased three to four wide through the turn, continued four wide into upper stretch
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SADIE LADY established control in short order, carved out the pace coaxed along, feeling some pressure from AMUSE to her outside, settled in at the
three-sixteenths pole and saw the pilot go to work, wandered about the expanse of its path, particularly when fed a left side salvo, while engaged in a
spirited tussle with CALL ON MISCHIEF, dug in determinedly clutching a narrow advantage, inched out late as the aforementioned foe moved inward
herself, resulting in contact between the pair right near the finish line, gamely reached it first to prevail. CALL ON MISCHIEF got set up in path three after
the field had been sent on its way, crept up to the top one after crossing midpoint on the turn, challenged in earnest in the general area of the
three-sixteenths pole, whittled away at the deficit, was still fully engaged with SADIE LADY in deep stretch as they bumped with each other, displayed
willingness to the end, but wound up the one to be denied. KANSAS KIS got firmly planted in the pocket, kept watch on the winner within striking distance,
got roused at the head of the stretch, went to and fro between the inside route and path two in a never-ending search for better racing room down the
stretch, got taken in hand twice, at the eighth pole and then at the sixteenth marker, when its path was squeezed a bit, ventured onward with interest,
ultimately having to settle for the show award. AMUSE prompted the winner two wide for nearly a half and gave way. PRAIRIE FIRE strung out three to four
wide on the bend, lacked a response. AWESOME DEBATE spotted the others a three to four wide instant deficit after stumbling at the start, brought up the
back of the pack, dove onto the inside route coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, swung slightly wider into the lane then went down it ridden out.
Following a Stewards' Inquiry in addition to a claim of foul lodged by the rider of CALL ON MISCHIEF against the rider of SADIE LADY alleging interference,
the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
LITTERBOX chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued five wide into upper stretch, closed well outside rivals through the stretch to
take command inside the sixteenth marker, edged away to the finish to prevail. FOREST SPIRIT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the
inside under some pressure from a pair, tucked along the inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive fending off rivals to the eighth pole, got collared inside the sixteenth marker and ran on to preserve the place honors.
SECOND FORTUNE chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, angled to the rail just inside the
three-sixteenths and ran on to secure the show honors. UP FOR ADVENTURE four then three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong. GO CASH GO coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide,
angled to the rail near the three-eighths sawing off DANEGELD and forcing that rival to check off his heels at that station, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. UNLIKELY four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths and bid into contention swinging four wide into upper stretch, couldn't sustain the move nearing the eighth pole and weakened through to the
finish. INTERSTATE six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun
three wide for home and made no impact. DANEGELD lunged a bit at the break getting away half a beat slow and was bumped by the breaking inwards
SKIPPINGANDAJUMPIN conceding three lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, came under coaxing and advanced to be just off the
pace along the inside into the turn, had GO CASH GO to his outside seven-sixteenths from home then paused and was forced to check as that rival tucked
to the inside directly in front at the three-eighths, lost two to three lengths of position and momentum as a result, the rider shaking his head at the move by
his foe, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out to the four or five path at the three-eighths as the
inside became a quagmire of traffic and tired. IN THE ZONE prompted the pace from the outside three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside for home and tired. SKIPPINGANDAJUMPIN broke in at the start bumping DANEGELD, came under coaxing and chased along the
inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the seven-sixteenths, went three wide for home and trailed.
