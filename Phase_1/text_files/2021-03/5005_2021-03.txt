Footnotes
SEVEN PLUS SEVEN rated off the contested pace while saving ground, eased out advancing past the five sixteenths, waited briefly near the quarter pole,
worked through between rivals nearing mid stretch, shifted in a bit and closed steadily under left handed pressure, bid inside PAY THE KID to draw on near
even terms fifty yards out, dueled and got up at the wire. PAY THE KID broke a step slow, was hustled up between foes soon after and entertained the
pace, rated back off the leaders past the five eighths, tracked then bid three deep nearing the lane, briefly shook clear in mid stretch, dug in when
confronted from his inside, fought gamely but just wasn't quite good enough. BOSS LIFE settled outside a rival early on, circled four to five wide and
advanced outside foes in upper stretch, had his rider lose the whip mid twirl past the three sixteenths, ranged up to loom in mid stretch but failed to follow
through. ISABELLA'S MAGIC broke slowly and got past tired rivals. KISSEDTHEGIRLS , three wide with speed early on, dueled outside BOOYAKASHA
from the five eighths into the lane, could not find more when between runners past the three sixteenths and weakened. BOOYAKASHA got involved in a
pace dispute soon after the break, battled along the rail to about mid stretch then faltered.

Footnotes
TALE OF DIXIE saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, eased out to the two path in upper stretch, gained command approaching the eighth pole and
held sway under steady handling. UNION CHARM raced in the two path between horses around the turn, angled to the three path turning for home and had
a slight rally outside the winner. NOT TELLING set the pace along the inner rail and weakened late. ROYALIAN , four deep on the turn, lacked the
necessary rally. HONOR MY WORLD , near the inner rail throughout, came up empty in the stretch. EJE GAMA , never a factor, floated six deep turning for
home. I WANT MORE , a forward factor three deep on the turn, gave way. ROYAL TRUMPET trailed.

Footnotes
FAST MASTER , well placed two wide eyeing a duel mid turn, eased out into the lane, closed steadily under a drive, hooked the leader heading towards the
sixteenth marker, gained a slim lead while being floated out in deep stretch, kept on determinedly and prevailed. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) prompted the
pace two wide, bid between foes heading to the turn, dueled, shook clear under asking in mid stretch, wandered outward while fighting on past the sixteenth
pole and continued gamely. FEATURE ACT lagged off the pace, dropped in to save ground around the turn, came out a few paths for the drive and closed
steadily. CAMPARI , sluggish from the gate, saved ground off the pace, eased out in the lane, had a belated kick but failed to threaten. KEEPING THE
PEACE pulled his way forward while outside rivals leaving the five eighths, bid three deep near the turn, pressed, wandered outward under pressure into the
lane, continued to drift out and weakened. BIG HAMBONE sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, met bids into the turn, sparred to upper stretch
then weakened through the final furlong. KIERLAND , off the pace, raced four wide into the lane but failed to respond.

BUTTER PECAN lacked speed, circled horses three wide around the turn, swept to command turning for home and drew away under mild encouragement.

of the others. WRITTENBYTHESTARS , three deep on the turn, lacked a serious rally. FRAME THAT DAME showed speed, set the pace in the two path
around the turn and tired in the stretch. BABY MELISSA lacked speed, swung to the four path leaving the turn and retreated through the stretch. NINE

Footnotes
LUCKY JUNIOR rated within range and outside a rival, took closer order while angling out to the three path mid turn, went on the attack between rivals
entering the lane, gained command near mid stretch, was headed from his outside soon after, battled back under solid handling and prevailed between foes.
EXTRA MEDIUM had speed then drafted back off the leaders and dropped in, relaxed within range into the turn, got through along the rail in upper stretch,
bid inside rivals in mid stretch and continued gamely to the wire. START WITH YES , a bit rank at the break, settled well back past the five eighths, quickly
gained four wide from the three eighths to the quarter pole, bid between foes nearing inside the three sixteenths, gained a short lead past mid stretch but
failed to sustain. MYSTIC TIMES , lunged at the break to be away last, regrouped and raced well wide off the early pace, moved up leaving the far turn,
rallied five wide and threatened outside rivals into the stretch, forced the issue past the furlong grounds but was out finished late. DAYSTRIKE grabbed
command early and set the pace well off the rail, dropped into the two path into the turn, took pressure, battled to mid stretch then faded in the final
sixteenth. SMOKIN HOT FACTOR chased the pace two wide and lacked a bid. IRISHTOWN , sluggish from the gate, lagged well back, swung seven to
eight wide and lacked a rally. SUPER BUDDY forced the pace four wide outside a rival, vied three wide around the turn and tired. PEP TALKING saved
ground and faltered.

Footnotes
PARADISE SONG tracked the dueling leaders while outside a rival, angled four wide into the lane, responded when roused past the three sixteenths,
asserted herself and quickly went clear a furlong out, eagerly widened under some hand urging then was geared down in the final yards. PRETTY LORI was
sent up between rivals to contest the early pace, emerged in a pace battle while saving ground past the five eighths, ceded the lead around the turn, came
back to regain a short lead into the stretch then kept on willingly though clearly no match for the winner. HIPNOTIZADA was off a step slow after being a
touch rank, regrouped and settled off the inside, gained four wide outside rivals into the turn and moved into a stalking spot, remained well wide pursuing
into the stretch and churned on with some interest. MALIBU BEAUTY was steadied back off rivals leaving the five eighths, steadied again while between
foes leaving the far turn, swung very wide into the lane and had belated action. BREEZE OFF THE BAY broke slowly, edged up inside then steadied off
heels after a furlong, continued inside around the turn, eased out and worked between runners nearing the sixteenth pole. LITTLE HUNTRESS bobbled
inward at the break, recovered and moved up inside rivals, rated back off the leaders near the five eighths, stalked inside leaving the three eighths, was
under coaxing into the stretch and came up empty. INSIGHTFUL sped to the early lead, was joined from her inside after a furlong, disputed the issue
outside PRETTY LORI from the five eighths to the quarter pole, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and gave way.

Footnotes
THUNDERINTHEVALLEY , five deep entering the stretch, gained a short lead when drifting in near the sixteenth pole and narrowly prevailed. AWESOME
BUTTERFLY showed speed, set the pace in the two path around the turn, opened a clear advantage in mid stretch, dug in tenaciously and lost his outer
girth near the finish. WARRIOR'S BLADE saved ground on the turn, remained inside horses in upper stretch, was checked in close quarters inside the
eighth pole, angled to the three path and closed. TAPDANCING GIRL , three wide entering the stretch, chased the leader and flattened out. CLASSY BUT
SASSY , four wide turning for home, flattened out. TURKISH ANGEL , bumped at the start, passed tired horses late. SOUTHERN GALAXY raced in the four
path entering the stretch and lacked a rally. LILY CHASER showed speed along the inenr rail and gave way in upper stretch. TRIVATI bumped with
TURKISH ANGEL leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail and was steadied in tight quarters entering the turn. INDUBITABLE was outrun.
SHUFFLEBOARD checked then stumbled in tight quarters near the half mile pole. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the turn down the backstretch
but no action was taken.
