JEWELED CROWN went to the front, drove clear, led throughout, pulled away down the stretch and won handily. CHICKEN OR THE EGG raced within
contention, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. GOLDEN EXPRESSO pressed the early pace, weakened
and proved no match for the top two. EMERY'S DREAM broke in the air at the break, racing in the rear, saved ground and was never a factor. PROSPECT
CRISSI lacked early speed and was never close. ARCTIC GUITAR raced in the back, came around the first turn wide and showed little.

Footnotes
CATCAKE lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn, angled out, made a wide rally, rallied and got up in time. ITSNOTMYJOB vied for the early
advantage, saved ground around the turn, took command and was caught late. LADY HOPPER bumped at the start, pressed the pace, saved ground
around the turn, couldn't match strides with the top two deep in the stretch and was a clear third at the wire. DIAL EM IN void of early speed, showed late
interest, but was no factor. SHE'S SEVENTEEN broke out, pressed the early pace and faded. NINEONEONEPRAYER bumped at the break, rushed up,
dueled for the lead and faded. SOPHISTICATED GIRL lacked early speed and was never close. SHE WANTS HALF raced in the middle of the pack and
dropped back.

close throughout and proved no match for the top two. CHAOSMOS raced near the middle of the field, came around the final turn four wide, made a mild
bid, but was no factor. LUCKY INFERNO raced in the middle of the pack, saved ground around the final turn and put forth an even effort. CARBONATED
challenged for the early advantage and was finished early. LIP SERVICE void of early speed, finished inside and was never a threat. STANTON C always
raced near the back and showed little. ARTIST BY THE SEA hopped at the start, raced near the back and was outrun.
