Footnotes
TURNSTONE pushed out slightly soon after the start, second flight inside, moved closer into the far turn, patiently handled, rail bid soon after, long drive,
proved best in determined fashion. BLACK KAT TAPS lacked speed off the inside, behind some traffic and the winner late in the final turn, followed that rival
through, challenged the winner nearing the furlong marker, outkicked in the late going, clearly second best. AREEMAA broke on top, showed the way while
angling in a bit in the first turn, clear in the run up the backstretch, allowed the winner the inside midway on the final turn began to weaken when headed by
the winner and the runner up into the lane, saved the show. MOORAC forwardly placed between foes past the wire the first turn, steadied a bit when in tight
into the first turn, stalked in the second flight up the backstretch, rebid three wide second turn, failed to sustain that effort in the drive. MOCHA KISS last
away, trailed while off the inside, three out to four wide when passing a tiring rival late in the final turn, made little impact in the drive while remaining out in
the strip. ENCANTA broke out a bit, forwardly placed inside early while rank, moved out, tired after six furlongs.

Footnotes
MY DOMINATOR stalked the pace while three wide in the second group, set down when straightened for home, late bid outside the leader, proved narrowly
best while fully extended. REDIVIVUS dueled up front in the two path, put the other speed away to be clear when straightened for home, responded when
challenged by the winner late, proved stubborn to the wire while inside that rival. PRIVATE TRUTH settled off the pace and the inside, lacked a closing
response. MY LITTLE TIP broke alertly, alternated up front inside the winner along the rail, weakened in the drive. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY one paced while off
the inside, three out to four wide turning for home, lacked a closing response. BROADWAY JERRY lacked speed, raced four out to five wide turning for
home, also came up empty for the stretch run. AWE BIRD raced back and failed to menace. STRATICUS hesitated then steadied at the break to spot the
field a couple of lengths, trailed throughout while racing three wide.

Footnotes
KALALOU broke on top, in the second flight inside, tipped out a bit when asked for some run late in the final turn, engaged the leader from the outside soon
after, quickly kicked clear under a left handed crop past the furlong marker, continued to increase that advantage to the wire. HUSH Y'ALL off the pace and
the inside, asked along second turn, floated out four wide into the lane, roused, finished with good late energy to be in time for the place. WISH YOU WERE
MINE took command after the start, showed the way into the first turn, larger lead in the run up the backstretch just off the inside, dropped to the rail second
turn, offered but brief resistance to the winner into the lane, weakened further late to be caught for the place. GLAMORIZED in the second flight outside,
floated out to be four wide turning for home, came up empty when set down for the drive. LUCKY BE A LADY four wide in the first turn, began to fade before
a half. POTRA LIZA off slowly, trailed much of the way while saving ground, picked off a tiring rival while never a factor.

FIVE RIVERS in the second group while racing three wide, continued to stalk in the three path turn, challenged outside the two leaders when straightened
for home, took over and steadily increased that advantage under steady handling the final furlong. WISH FOR CANDY broke in but toward the front, dueled
into and through the turn closest to the inside, larger lead midway on the bend, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner past the furlong marker then
could not keep up. MISS CHECKMARK closest to the dueling leaders along the inside,continued to save ground through the turn, moved out late when
advancing on the runner up, quickly getting to that rival late, no threat to the winner. HADLEYS HERO broke out to bump SKADI then steadied to spot the
field a couple of lengths, remained back, swung out to be five wide turning for home, improved position while finding best stride too late. ANGEL ARKIE
away in good order, dueled with the runner up in the run up the backstretch and into the turn, began to weaken before a half. NATURAL JEWEL broke
outward, raced outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a serious response in the drive. LADY MONDORO broke inward, bumped foe, mid pack and in
the two path, had little for the drive. EPWORTH broke slowly and remained back. SKADI pinched, bumped both sides start, began a steady fade before a
half.

Footnotes
LIL TATER with the pace while in the two path, disposed of the other speed turning for home, clear, drew out, driving. LUCKY EVERY DAY behind the pace
while racing in the two path, dropped to the inside turning for home, could do little with the winner in the final furlong, clear of the others. LOUEMMA
prompted the pace while racing three wide, roused for the drive, proved no match for the top two in the run to the wire. DENA'S BOLD MOVE settled in mid
pack while racing off the inside, two path and between horses upper stretch, improved position a bit without posing a threat. GET ONE MORE last away,
raced back, three wide into the lane, displayed some late interest while also not a serious threat. WARM BEAUTY void of speed, failed to menace while
saving ground into the stretch. SHOOT ME STRAIGHT in the main body while racing three wide, had nothing for the drive. AMELIA'S BONNET broke back
and was always outrun. GOLD N SEXY flashed early foot inside the winner for three furlongs and stopped.

SEA TO SUCCESS bobbled just after the start, raced back, in traffic midway on the turn, waited, came three wide into the stretch between foes, set down
when clear finished with good energy to win going away. WAYAKIN lacked speed, raced four wide through the turn, asked along late in the bend, proved no
match for the winner late, edged clear for the place. COLD AS HELL lacked speed, five wide into the turn, worked way down to the three path into the lane,
went late late to annex the show. FLAT OUT AVENGER last to leave, trailed early as a result, angled out to be six wide while bumped turning for home,
improved position with some mild late energy. SPOTTED BULL away well, quickly sprinted clear, expanded that advantage through the turn and into the
lane, caved in readily when confronted in the late going. JACKMAN broke well, fell back behind the pace, two path into the turn, four to five wide, bumped
with FLAT OUT AVENGER turning for home, finished up evenly in lacking a closing kick. CITI CHARM in mid pack while racing outside, four wide through
the turn, failed to muster a rally when roused for the drive. EASTSIDE COOL in the second flight early off the inside, two path into the lane, gave way.
OUTLIER forwardly placed for a half, gave way in the drive.

MATERA took command into the first turn in the two path, rated in the run up the backstretch while continuing to show the way, shook off a foe turning into
the stretch, held the runner up safe the final furlong under a firm left handed crop. BRITTLE AND YOO with the winner into the first turn, book back off that
rival onto the backstretch, moved out a bit while remaining under restraint before a half, raced three wide through the second turn, advanced on the winner
turning for home, could do little with the. AUCTION FEVER void of early speed inside, remained back, angled out to be four wide into the stretch, staged a
mild rally to be clear of the rest, not a threat to the top two. SUNSET PAULA JO pulled through the first turn when within striking distance, remained
forwardly placed the middle half, came up empty when called on along the inside for the drive. TONAL VISION last to leave, lacked speed, made little
impact in the drive. SUMMER STORM prompted the winner from the outside for six furlongs, backed up in the drive. SHACKADELIC four wide through the
first turn, remained well wide while being finished early.

Footnotes
STRONG TIDE broke well, took back off the leaders in the first turn, pulled entering the stretch for the first time, continued to be patiently handled into the
far turn, asked along midway on the final bend, long drive, proved best while fully extended. CLAYTNTHELIONHEART three wide and forwardly placed
under restraint, continued to stalk the middle three quarter, ranged up and challenged midway on the final turn, extended stretch run, not enough for the
winner late while between horses, prevailed for the place. JUMPER away in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, helped set a reasonable set of
early fractions, shook off the other speed midway up the backstretch, responded when confronted in the third turn, spirited stretch run, gave ground
grudgingly to the top two. LAUGHING FOX last away, trailed early while off the inside, continued in the two path throughout, displayed a mild amount of
interest through the lane, to improve, no threat to the top three. EXCESSION went one paced throughout while racing just off the inside. STOCK DEAL
settled off the pace, continued unhurried, came four wide out of the final turn, lacked a closing response. HIT THE TICKET dueled in the two path, stopped
after a half, fell far back and was distanced after losing contact with the field through the stretch, jogged in, walked off.

Footnotes
MAKE'N TRACKS unhurried early in the three path through the first turn, continued outside, swept up into contention while five wide turning for home,
brushed upper stretch, continued willingly to the wire to be up in time on the outside. ITS MY BAG BABY broke well, settled off the pace inside, continued to
save ground into the far turn, steered out a bit around a tiring rival turning for home, took command late, could not contain the winner, remained clear for the
place. FAST RECOVERY away well, dueled up front closest to the inside, continued to duel through the second turn, weakened a bit into the lane, came
back for the show while remaining to race along the rail. SPIN RATE pressed or dueled up front off the inside, took command turning for home, narrowly
showed the way past the furlong grounds, faltered in the late going. SHE LOVE ME raced in mid pack off the inside, four wide through the second turn,
lacked a closing response. LIFE ON THE ROAD remained back in lacking a closing response. CONQUISTADOR SHOW raced in the main body while
toward the inside, faded through the stretch. COPLEY within striking distance while racing off the inside, began to tire after a half. MAJOR KONG off slowly,
sluggish, well back, pulled up first turn, walked back.
