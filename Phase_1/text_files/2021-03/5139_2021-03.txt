I'M ALL MIXED UP pressed the early pace, raced close throughout and proved the best late. ROSE CROWN lacked early speed, made a late gain, racing
five wide and finished willingly. ENVOYS LEGACY raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside, entered the stretch four wide and
proved no match for the top two. JERRY'S LEGACY went to the front, drove clear and was outfinished for third. DECADENT DIAMOND raced in the middle
of the field and put forth an even effort, lacking a rally. VIKING VOYAGE stumbled at the start, racing near the back, rushed up, pressed the pace,
weakened, bled and was vanned off. ACCUSTOMED TO HOPE raced evenly near the back and showed little. CAJUN MUSIC void of early speed and was
outrun. FROMAGENTLEMAN raced within contention and dropped back.

I'M LOOKING UP pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn and drove clear down the stretch. WARRIORS GEM raced within striking distance, came
around the turn four wide, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. LEO DEL REO went to the front, drove clear and lacked
a late kick. DRIED PEPPER raced in the back of the pack, made a wide gain, but was no factor. POPULIST raced evenly near the back, made a mild bid,
but was no threat. ELUSIVE D'ORO void of early speed, saved ground around the turn and showed little. OUTAMINE raced within contention, saved ground
around the turn and faded. LET IT B pressed the early pace and dropped back.

Footnotes
GLORY ROAD unhurried in the early part, raced five wide around the first turn, moved up, pressed the pace, rallied down the stretch and drove clear.
GIANT MESA pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, took the advantage around the second turn, couldn't match strides with the winner late, but
was a clear second. BODEMEISTER WIND raced near the back in the beginning, made a late wide bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third.
CHARLIES TICKET vied for the early lead, eased back, made a mild bid late, but was no factor. LAST BATTLE challenged for the early lead, saved ground
around the final turn and weakened. MUSCADINE void of early speed, had an outside trip, made a bid around the final turn and was finished early. WILD
ONE FOREVER lacked early speed and passed tired ones. ALTERANA raced near the back, came around the first turn six wide, never mounted a bid and
was outrun. CROQUE MONSIEUR (GB) raced within contention and made a steady retreat. I'LL RAISE YOU raced near the middle of the field and dropped
