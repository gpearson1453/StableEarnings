was fractious in the gate, raced well back well off the rail and was green in the stretch. BAHAMIAN DUDE had brief speed three wide. WICKED

Footnotes
DREAMING THOUSAND dueled outside UNLONELY from the start, gained the upper hand leaving the furlong grounds and edged away. UNLONELY
battled inside DREAMING THOUSAND, could not match strides late and saved the place. MASTER Q saved ground in midpack for three-eighths of a mile,
moved out in the stretch and rallied mildly. MAYOR REMO pursued the leaders near the inside to the lane, and finished evenly. CHEVAL DORE raced three
wide around the turn, and had no solid final response. ASCENDED was no factor three to four wide. THIRSTY'S PRIDE was outrun in the two-path. LEMON
GO broke poorly and was always far back. M V SPEED checked sharply out of the gate while shifting about erratically, and was cautiously handled far
behind.

Footnotes
KANTHAROS' IMAGE settled two wide in midpack, angled six wide turning for home, closed between rivals, seized command near the sixteenth pole and
held off foes under a drive. SLIPPIN JIMMY raced off the pace three wide, came eighth wide into the lane and rallied outside of the winner. NEW YORK'S
FINEST prompted the pace two wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, led to the sixteenth marker but could not hold off the top two. GRACEFUL KITTEN
raced off the pace two wide and rallied belatedly. MACHO BLUE chased the pace four wide, bid nearing the eighth pole and flattened out. FIELDER saved
ground off the pace swung out in the stretch and never threatened. FIG JELLY steadied near the three-eighths pole, was in range three wide, steadied off
heels nearing the sixteenth pole and dropped back. TALE OF KANTHAROS played no factor while racing three wide around the turn and swinging widest in
the lane. LONG BLADE has speed inside, bobbled midway around the turn, bid between foes nearing the eighth pole then weakened. TIMMY M. was outrun
while racing three wide. ZAINO BOYZ set the pace along the rail and tired. DIAMOND PLAY was outrun while racing two wide.

ICED LATTE went up to engage SURREALIST from the inside midway up the backstretch, gained the upper hand through upper stretch and drew clear
under pressure. SURREALIST sprinted to the early lead, battled outside ICED LATTE through the middle stages, could not match strides near the
eighth-pole and settled for second best. VIVA LA RED sat perched outside the leaders three wide around the turn, could not gain through the stretch and
was clearly best of the others. ZURI was outrun early two wide, and passed only tired horses. DREAM ABOUT ME saved ground to the stretch, and faded
on her left lead. SKYBOX raced three wide, and was finished after six furlongs. MARY JANE CHROME brushed with APART OF MY CHARM at the start,
and was through early. APART OF MY CHARM brushed with MARY JANE CHROME and was slow to begin, and dropped far back before reaching the
stretch.

Footnotes
RAISON D'AIR set a rated pace inside and drew off under a drive. SAFE CONDUCT broke out and bumped FUEGO CALIENTE at the start, had early
speed between, rated outside of the winner, could not quicken with that foe in upper stretch and held for the place. BUGLE OF WAR had early speed three
wide, rated back and angled in entering the first turn, saved ground in range and lacked the needed rally. FUEGO CALIENTE was bumped at the start,
tracked the pace three wide and finished evenly. JIMMY P saved ground off the pace, swung out in lane and never threatened. MAJOR FRONTIER played
no factor while racing two and three wide. PUGIN checked off BUGLE OF WAR'S heels entering the first turn, raced two wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
PRO QUALITY vied up front throughout, dueled outside HONOLULU EXPRESS as they put some daylight on the others nearing the quarter-pole, and
prevailed through the lane under a vigorous hand drive. HONOLULU EXPRESS contested the lead inside, dug in battling inside PRO QUALITY through the
stretch, stayed on gamely and was clearly second best. NACHO PAPA saved ground in range for six furlongs, moved out at the top of the stretch with the
leaders in view, but could not gain under pressure. GREEN MANSIONS raced near the three-path, and lacked the needed late response. DARK AGES
lagged in the second flight to the turn, swung five wide past the quarter-pole and had no response. JUST LIKE MIKE vied early while very wide and far
removed from the others, moved in to the four-path going to the turn, and retired after six furlongs. FAST LOADED stopped soon after going a half-mile, and
jogged in far behind.

LA BABIA stalked the pace two wide, took over near the quarter pole, drew clear in midstretch and held firm under a drive. UNA LUNA saved ground off the
early pace, raced two wide between foes rounding the far turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside, switched back to the left lead late and was
gaining. NOPE (IRE) raced three wide in midpack early, advanced three deep around the far turn but was one-paced in the lane. ROSA STAR set the pace
inside and weakened in the lane. OSAKA GIRL tracked the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. SUNSET KISS (GB) steadied slightly after the start, saved
ground and failed to menace. CAIRA played no factor while racing two and three wide. STORM AT SEA trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
EXPONENTIAL advanced to contention after a half-mile, ranged up four wide to take over turning for home, and drove clear. DECLAREATRUCE raced well
back for six furlongs, angled to the far outside in upper stretch and finished well to go clear of the rest. LOVE LIFE was outrun early, swung four wide off the
far turn, and was along for the show with an even finish. NO DRAMA saved ground close up under a hold to the far turn, remained inside for the drive and
weakened on his left lead. COMMAND CENTRAL tracked outside the leaders for six furlongs, and tired. SUPPLICATION went up to engage THE ZIP
FACTOR from outside leaving the first turn, vied through the middle fractions, and weakened in the lane on his left lead. THE ZIP FACTOR was sent for the
early lead and cleared inside, vied inside SUPPLICATION up the backstretch and into the far turn, and gave way into the stretch. CITY GLORY broke slowly
and was never prominent. GAEL POWER broke a step slow, raced in tight quarters behind and between horses early, and was finished before reaching the
stretch.
