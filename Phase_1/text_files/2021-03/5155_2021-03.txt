Footnotes
OTSEGO was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and drew off with complete authority. BUGGER RED
broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing four-wide but could not match strides with that rival in the drive. SPECIAL FORTUNE pressed the
pace from the inside, dropped back nearing the three-eighths marker and finished with some late run. BUD MINISTER showed no early speed, raced
four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. SITUATENSHADY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BACK TO
BLACK was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.

BEAUREGARD was away in good order to set a pressured pace, responded when challenged nearing the five-sixteenths pole but SOONER THAN
SOONER, vied with that rival and edged away late. SOONER THAN SOONER raced five-wide through the first turn, raced just off the leaders early, moved
up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with the winner but could not get by that foe in the drive. NAUTICAL MOON lacked early
foot, moved up five-wide for a striking position nearing the quarter but failed to sustain her rally in the drive. MAKE MY YEAR was forwardly placed from the
inside throughout and gradually weakened. WILD AND GOLDEN showed no early speed and did not reach contention. NOTORIOUS L. I. A. pressed the
pace of the winner while racing three-wide for a half, weakened and was eased.

Footnotes
LA MORENA was away alertly to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin into the lane and gamely held off JUSTPLAINJANE to
prevail. JUSTPLAINJANE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached a striking position with a sixteenth to run but
could not get by the winner. GOSPEL CARLOTTA settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the lane and finished with
good energy. SATIN FINISH broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. EXCETERA raced off the
pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. SMOKEY REFLECTION lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. OTEKA BE FAST pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide for a half and weakened. MISS COFFEYVILLE raced off the
leaders from the inside and weakened. VALENTINA LIL was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. LIKE A CAT dwelt.
SPENT IT AT HARRYS jumped the rail soon after the start and unseated his rider.

GRAND ROYALE pressed the pace of the dueling leaders while racing five-wide, moved up to engage nearing the three-sixteenths pole, vied with
CATALOGUE and edged away from that foe in the final yards. CATALOGUE dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, was taken on by the winner into
the stretch, vied with that rival but could not match strides late. FLASH ATTACK was away in good order to dispute the pace from between foes for a half
and weakened. COOL CATOMINE broke sharply to vied for the early advantage from the inside and weakened after a half. JUST CALL ME KEN showed
no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GOSPEL JOHN sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. AWESOME
THUNDER pulled to contend, chased the winner while racing three-wide and finished willingly in the drive. DEVIN was forwardly placed early, moved
four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. GRUFFANDTOUGH settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and
finished evenly late. FAR LEFT showed brief speed and weakened. RUN BUDDA RUN raced off the pacesetters from between foes and gradually
weakened. DOCTOR H W was off a step slow, rushed to contention and weakened soon after. SILVER STAR OKIE refused to break.
