ROCHELA quickly showed in front, set the pace racing with a clear lead, moved off the inside, responded when roused entering the stretch and held well
under urging. BAAQEYA chased inside in the early stages, chased on the turn, raced evenly, drifted out in midstretch and held for second. WOMAN FLYER
stumbled badly at the start, raced off the pace inside, angled out on the turn, rallied mildly outside in the stretch. MAD MARY chased between rivals early,
chased on the turn and closed mildly on the rail. PRINCESS MIKAYAH stumbled at the start while breaking on top, raced three wide and lacked a rally.
TOWSON raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn and did not factor. RISQUE EXPRESS raced four wide off the pace and was outrun. A Jockey's

STREET TAIL vied outside, dropped back briefly on the turn then came again through the stretch and edged clear in the final furlong. FIVE MORE
MINUTES chased wide off the leaders and continued willingly for the place. CATCH FIRE saved ground within striking range and lacked a solid rally.
INSPIRING JUSTICE hustled to the lead inside, moved clear nearing the quarter pole but came up empty late. GET THE W lagged far behind, moved wide
in the stretch and was no factor. DON'T MAKE IT EASY was urged just off the pace between rivals and stopped abruptly.

BELLA G stalked the pacesetter, chased on the far turn, rallied outside of SHOOBIEDOOBYDOO at the quarter pole, moved past that rival in the stretch
and drew clear under urging. SHOOBIEDOOBYDOO set the pace racing with a clear early lead, showed the way into the far turn, dueled with the winner
passing the quarter pole, dug in gamely but second best. BELONGS TO BABE reluctant to load, raced three wide early, stalked outside, chased on the far
turn and weakened. LIGHT UP NIGHT raced off the pace, came wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. LADY FOX tracked inside, chased on the far turn
and tired. MISQUILLO raced off the pace and was outrun.

DANZAFIED vied along the inside, drew away after half a mile and widened under pressure. BABBO BABBO BABBO rallied along the inside on the turn
and continued gamely to the finish. TOMMY THE TORCH dueled with the winner outside for half a mile and faltered. STONEGATE bothered slightly leaving
the chute, chased between rivals and flattened out. BREES BAYOU dropped back three wide and lacked a rally. ALFATEI chased four wide down the
backstretch and turn then was no factor. INSTAFAMOUS bothered in the early stages while in tight, raced inside and was no threat. PERFECT DAYDREAM
was squeezed back early and always far back. CHUB ON DA RUN was urged close up three wide then began retreating on the turn. A claim of foul by the
rider of STONEGATE against the rider of TOMMY THE TORCH for early interference was dismissed by the stewards.

Footnotes
YOUR PAL stalked the pacesetters inside then wore down the leaders following a long drive through the final furlong. LOVE ON FIRE dueled outside,
moved clear on the turn and continued gamely to the finish. COLD HEARTED PEARL was taken up sharply inside into the far turn, was taken up again near
the five sixteenths pole, swung very wide into the stretch and closed a late gap. DREAMING DIAMONDS bid outside on the turn, loomed a threat but
weakened. ODD GAL broke sluggishly, saved ground and lacked a rally. ALWAYS TALKING held a narrow lead inside, vied through the turn then gave
way. AUSSIE MIST broke a bit awkwardly, chased wide then gave way readily. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the traffic problems on the turn with
no action taken.

Footnotes
BEACHSIDE lacked speed, steadied lacking room on the turn, swung very wide into the stretch then surged clear. NO FLY ZONE vied between rivals in the
opening quarter, faded on the turn, came again, led but was caught. GRAYS THE BAR dueled inside, pulled away on the turn but proved empty in the final
furlong. RISING STORM moved closer briefly into the far turn and finished willingly. DEMOCRATIC lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. YES FOR
LESS lacked speed, chased very wide and was never a factor. INDIRECTLY dropped back outside and was always outrun. RODEO RED forced the pace
inside then stopped after half a mile. JUST ENOUGH dueled four wide down the backstretch and stopped abruptly.
