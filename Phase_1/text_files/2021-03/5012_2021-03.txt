Footnotes
VAN KHOZAN broke readily, was rated out of striking distance tracking the pacesetter a bit off the rail to the backstretch, steadily closed the gap entering
the far turn to bid for command between foes, then took over and went clear under firm handling. HIGHRHYTHMDIXIE, urged to a forward placing three
wide racing to the first turn, tracked the leader outside a rival through the backstretch, advanced in tandem with that foe to challenge three deep nearing
upper stretch but couldn't match the winner while best of the others. MERICATHEBEAUTIFUL angled to the rail tracking off the second flight racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance while shifting to the four path racing into the lane and continued well enough to gain a share. LADY MIDAS settled
last along the inside early, saved ground throughout and made an effort to improve position into the lane. MAY BEAU popped through the gate to be taken
in the assistant starter's hand just as the field was breaking from the gate, was away awkwardly, then caught four wide in the last flight racing to the
backstretch and faded after a half. CROSS THE MERSEY urged clear along the inside racing to the backstretch, set the pace on a clear margin to the far
turn and gave out once headed by the winner. BLAZING DIVA tracked the leaders behind the second flight three deep between foes racing to the
backstretch and soon dropped out. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
SMOKEY SONG raced between foes just off the first flight in the opening stages, angled inwards tracking the leaders through the backstretch, shifted out
three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady bid to wrest command and go clear under left handed pressure. MUST BE A MONSTER,
urged three wide between foes prompting the pace to gain the advantage racing into the turn, dueled inside the winner to midstretch but proved no match
late. TARQUIN, forwardly placed in the four path prompting the pace racing to the turn, steadily faded nearing the lane. ODESSA GOLD tracked off the
second flight along the inside racing to the turn and continued evenly to late stages. BIZ NOW ducked out at the start into the path of SEWEL, was urged to
gain the lead racing off the rail disputing the pace inside a rival racing to the turn and emptied out nearing upper stretch. DISTINCTIVE ECHO settled
outside foes in early stages and failed to menace thereafter. SEWEL, bumped at the start, then held up avoiding tight quarters while dropping out last,
trailed throughout.

EXCEED THE GOAL was rated tracking the first flight from just out of striking position racing through the backstretch, shifted four wide on the turn steadily
advancing on those rivals, gained the advantage racing through upper stretch and kicked clear late under firm encouragement. PATIENT DIGNA ducked out
at the start, was quickly righted while angling inwards to dictate the pace on a narrow margin between foes through the backstretch, dueled for command
between on the turn to midstretch but couldn't match the winner while grudgingly prevailing for the place honors. MI TIA CHRISTINA, off slowly, pulled her
way to terms with the leaders three deep prompting the pace into the turn, dueled between foes into upper stretch and was outkicked for second. FOXY
LADY, forwardly placed along the inside prompting the pace racing into the turn, dueled inside foes into upper stretch and weakened in late stages.
LEDECKY settled along the inside early and never gained striking distance. SASSY MISS MARGIE switched out four wide in the opening stages while
settling last and retreated after a half.

Footnotes
PHARAOH FANCY PANT was rated just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn to bid three wide between foes nearing upper
stretch, wrested the advantage midstretch and drove clear. ITSMYLUCKYSUMMER settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled
out five wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to prevail for second. DRAKESBORO WILDCAT joined the pace three wide racing to the
first turn, pressed the issue outside a rival to the far turn, dueled between foes into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. SWIFT KID, held up while
angling inside in early stages, gained contention along the rail entering the far turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed
late kick. MONETIZED, in touch with the first flight nearest the rail racing to the first turn, was eased off those rivals to stalk just off the first flight to the
second bend, briefly awaited an opening between foes nearing upper stretch and came up empty in the drive. CURLEE FOX, urged between foes, then
along the inside disputing the pace into the far turn, gave way leaving midstretch. ANGEL'S ENTRY tracked off the second flight racing to the backstretch,
shifted out advancing, three, then four wide entering the far turn and gave way into the lane. EL FEFO dropped out early. DRILL BIT proved no factor.

Footnotes
SAYOH stalked just off the pacesetter along the inside under light rating to the far turn, came through inside that foe when presented an opening in upper
stretch to challenge for command and wrested a clear advantage in time under steady handling. ASTERS D'ORO, urged to the lead along the inside,
dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, shifted out nearing midstretch while being roused to maintain the advantage but proved only second
best. RED PIXIE tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, then altered course abruptly in the closing
stages crossing the path of PATSY'S BIG GIRL while edging rivals for a share on the wire. TABLE ONE, in touch with the pacesetter prompting that foe to
the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the leader between foes into upper stretch but weakened late. ABUELA CORI tracked off the first flight between foes
racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide entering the lane and continued evenly late. ESTILO ELEGANTE settled between foes in the opening stages,
angled out racing into upper stretch making some mild progress but lost momentum when being carried out by PATSY'S BIG GIRL in late stages. UPPER
SPEED DS settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. PATSY'S BIG GIRL tracked off the first flight outside foes in early
stages, advanced three deep nearing the far turn to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, weakened between foes leaving midstretch, then was
steadied when avoiding RED PIXIE in the closing stages while ducking into the path of ESTILO ELEGANTE. STEPPIN ON OUT proved no factor. DANCE
WISE was never a factor. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN LATE STRETCH AND
DISQUALIFIED RED PIXIE FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER EIGHTH.

MAKE A SCENE tracked off the first flight inside rivals through the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance
between foes, took over racing past midstretch and kicked clear under firm encouragement. HELL OF THE NORTH joined the pace three wide in the
opening stages, pressed the issue into to the turn to gain a brief advantage approaching upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner.
PACIFIC PRINCESS tracked off the first flight outside the eventual winner racing to the turn, was prompted to advance in tandem with that rival while being
fanned five wide nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. DANNYHILL, held up out of tight quarters at the start, settled along the inside racing
through the backstretch, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch but passed only tiring rivals. NURSE JUDY, urged inside foes pressing the pace
through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. ROYAL MISSION, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn,
was through after a half.

Footnotes
KITTEN WITH A WHIP was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch while under light reserve, switched off the inside
nearing the far turn while commencing a steady three wide advance, moved to challenge in that path nearing upper stretch, then wrested the advantage
leaving the furlong marker to go clear under pressure. V K STAR, in touch prompting the pacesetter from the outset racing to the backstretch, took over after
a half while shifting to the inside, dueled inside rivals to upper stretch and proved best of the others while failing to contain the winner. FAST FASHION was
rated off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched out racing into upper stretch but weakened in the closing stages while continuing
well enough to prevail for a share. BEE DANNA, held up avoiding tight quarters at the start, was settled outside a rival in the last flight early, steadily gained
position in the two path after a half, was fanned four wide into upper stretch but continued with interest to gain position to the end. NANCY WORK, reserved
along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched out after the opening three furlongs commencing a sharp, early advance between foes racing to the
second bend, lodged a brief bid between the top pair nearing upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum in the drive. MY OWN PASSION settled
outside foes racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. IMPETUOSITY settled between foes well off the leaders in early stages and offered no closing
bid. UNIQUE GIRL dropped back early. AMERICAN EMPRESS, urged inside a rival pressing the pace to the backstretch, gave way after a half. AWESOME
GAP switched out tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch but retreated early.

Footnotes
DRILL'S VALENTINE, forwardly placed pursuing the pacesetter in the three path racing into the turn, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch, shifted
inside the pacesetter entering upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to narrowly prevail in time under firm encouragement. LA WAPA
broke sharply while shifting inwards into the path of LADY ALLYN, set the pace off the rail racing through the backstretch, shifted to the three path nearing
upper stretch and contested the issue outside the winner to late stages while just failed to contain that rival. ASTROMELIA tracked off the second flight three
wide racing through the backstretch into the turn and steadily improved position between foes in that path to the closing stages while edging a rival for a
share. WEST BURKE settled outside foes in the last flight early, swung out five wide entering upper stretch and produced her best stride late to close the
gap. PASSIONFORTREASURE angled inwards to track just off the leaders between foes racing into the turn, advanced nearing upper stretch to bid
between foes but weakened late. CAJUN DELIGHT, off slowly, switched out six wide in the opening stages while being prompted to contention, continued
four wide off the second flight racing into the turn, then to upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. GALIT JAK tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as
part of the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and faded in late stages. RACE DAY SPEED, pinched back at the start, offered no rally. LADY
ALLYN, carried in at the start, never menaced thereafter. HARTS N FLOWERS stumbled at the start and soon trailed.

ACT LIKE ARTIE was rated off the second flight racing three wide to the backstretch, steadily advanced on the pacesetter in that path nearing the far turn,
made a sharp move to open a commanding advantage racing into upper stretch, held sway under pressure and was taken in hand when his rider corrected
his course in the final stages. STRONG GEM, held up avoiding close quarters at the start, settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, advanced to
contention four wide into the second bend, was urged to advance three deep into upper stretch and proved best of the others. PRINCESS CORA tracked
the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight, shifted out racing into the far turn and continued with interest between foes to prevail for a share. ZANDREA'S,
reserved along the inside in early, gained position between foes entering the far turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued to gain some
position. STORMY MUSIC, held up last along the inside to the backstretch, swung outside foes racing into the far turn to four, then five wide to upper stretch
and gained some position while making no real impression. DREAMING OF PARIS, forwardly placed between foes tracking the pacesetter in second flight,
faded after a half. VOLADOR tracked off the second flight between foes, angled to the rail nearing the far turn and steadily faded into the stretch. STUY
TOWN BABY pulled her way clear racing to the backstretch but came up empty entering the far turn. MOTHERWELL proved no factor. PLAYIN DISCO
worked her way to the inside tracking off the second flight, retreated early and was gathered up late.
