Footnotes
DISCREET TUNE broke outward, vied inside MARSAC for three furlongs, shook that one off when roused mildly into the stretch, and remained well clear.
MARSAC dueled outside DISCREET TUNE to the top of the stretch, could not match strides approaching the eighth-pole and ran on best of the rest.
CHARLIECANDO bumped with INACEPTABLE at the start, chased two to three wide to the stretch, and could not gain. GRAND UNION saved ground to no
avail. INACEPTABLE bumped with CHARLIECANDO at the start, and played no part. DEAL TWO steadied behind DISCREET TUNE at the break, and
trailed inside.

SIR KAHN advanced around the turn four then three wide, challenged outside KHOZY MY BOY and ROUGH ENTRY in upper stretch, and prevailed after a
long drive. ROUGH ENTRY vied early inside VISION OF THANOS, got the best of that dispute on the turn while being confronted by KHOZY MY BOY and
SIR KAHN, dug in gamely on the rail and saved a share of second. KHOZY MY BOY ranged up three then two wide to reach the front just after going three
furlongs, battled between horses through a long drive and finished on even terms for the place. LAVERY saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper
stretch and lacked the needed closing response. VISION OF THANOS pressed ROUGH ENTRY from outside entering the turn, and gave way before
reaching the stretch.

COURTED saved ground close up for six furlongs, moved off the rail in upper stretch, bid outside ROSEY'S INVASION past the eighth-pole and forged
clear. SUSPICIOUS MINDS was unhurried early inside, moved out for the drive, swapped back to her left lead a sixteenth out and finished well. ROSEY'S
INVASION set the pace inside, could not withstand the winner entering the final furlong, weakened on the rail and barely salvaged the show. TOURING
EGYPT loomed three wide approaching the stretch, but lacked the needed response when set down. VIANI raced two to three wide throughout, and posed
no threat. KAMALA was never involved. GINGERONMYMIND prompted the pace two wide for six furlongs, and was empty into the lane.

Footnotes
UPHOLD THE LAW stalked the pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, rallied outside, took over nearing the sixteenth pole and drew off under
a drive. TWICE TOO MANY set the pace in the two path, was headed by MY MANE MAN nearing the five-sixteenths pole, regained command in upper
stretch, led past the eighth pole but was no match for the winner. MY MANE MAN raced a bit greenly inside early, angled out and rushed up outside down
the backstretch, bid four wide around the turn, took the lead nearing the five-sixteenths pole but weakened in the lane. COTTON JIM failed to menace while
racing three and four wide. NUREYEV'S DREAM bobbled after the start, chased the pace two and three wide and lacked a closing bid.
ONENAMESAYSITALL had early speed three wide, got out around the turn and retreated.

AWSUM ROAR raced in striking range three wide to the stretch, rallied determinedly and overhauled MY SARASOTA STAR from outside in the closing
yards. MY SARASOTA STAR sprinted clear early, fended off a challenge from CAT'S ASTRAY past the quarter-pole and through upper stretch, edged
away into the final furlong but could not withstand the winner. ODRAMARK angled in after the start causing crowding, raced four wide around the turn, and
rallied mildly. SETHAMEE STREET went around the turn two wide and between horses, shifted out for the drive and did not have enough to make her
presence felt. SANITY saved ground around the turn, and had no final rally in the two-path. DANCING DOLL steadied behind ODRAMARK shortly after the
start, and was outrun three wide. CAT'S ASTRAY advanced outside MY SARASOTA STAR to challenge a quarter-mile out, could not sustain the bid
approaching mid stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
HERCULES stalked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide in upper stretch, rallied on the left lead between foes, took the lead nearing the sixteenth pole,
finally switched to the right lead leaving that marker and drove clear. DROPPED ANCHOR set the pace along the rail to the sixteenth marker and settled for
second best late. GEGE CONQUEST was in range three wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and was
one-paced through the stretch. CARAMEL CHIP chased the pace four wide and lacked a rally. KHOZANDO had his head turned at the start, raced well
back inside, angled out in upper stretch and never threatened. HARD GAME pressed the pace two wide and tired in the drive. BRACCIO DI FERRO was
slammed at the start, raced three wide and made little impact. JACOHARE was slammed at the start, had some speed four wide, stopped and was eased in
the lane.

Footnotes
KROY took command and moved inside after the start, rated along to the far turn, repelled bids from ZAP DADDY and FREEDOM MATTERS after six
furlongs, and kicked away staying on his left lead. DOMINATE THEMOMENT advanced three wide leaving the far turn, rallied into second through the
furlong grounds, then finished evenly. FREEDOM MATTERS lunged at the break and was slowest to begin, steadied along the rail approaching the first
turn, moved out with a three-wide bid on the far turn, got shaken off by KROY in upper stretch and weakened. ZAP DADDY prompted the pace outside
KROY to the far turn, got shaken off approaching the stretch, moved inside and had nothing more. SOUPER JAGUAR went along under a firm hold inside
early, and was empty when roused at the top of the stretch. MAJESTIC LUNA showed early speed two wide, and weakened under urging into the lane.
