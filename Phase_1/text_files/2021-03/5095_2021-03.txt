STARSHIP DEFIANT had good early speed outside of ELGOFANCO, cleared that rival approaching the half-mile pole, led in the two path to the stretch and
drew away under right-handed urging and strong handling in the final furlong. ELGOFRANCO showed early speed along the inside then chased the leader
to the turn, switch outside and had aim three wide into the lane, could not find the needed late response and kept on to save the place. MISS O'BRIEN
stalked off the inside, went three wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch, offered a mild response and missed the place. STARSHIP ENDEAVOR
chased well off the inside, entered the turn four wide then angled to the rail around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
CAUSEIDIDITMYWAY up close outside the pacesetter, headed rival around the far turn, put a nose in front at the quarter pole, put away inside rival in
upper stretch then held a short lead over the runner-up at the eighth pole and inched away in the late stages. ITSTHATTIME raced off the rail while in range,
came four wide into the stretch, put in a mild bid inside the furlong marker but faltered in the final sixteenth. ALCOOLS set the pace in the two path around
the first turn, moved inside on the backstretch, held a short lead over the winner around the far turn then relinquished command a quarter mile out, churned
on from inside and secured the show. JUSTIN'S QUEST stalked the pace in the two path through the turns and into the the stretch and finished evenly.
SEICHE tucked inside early, raced in the two path up the backstretch, came back to the rail on the second bend, tipped out into the stretch, angled out
upper stretch and was never a factor. MALAKAI MOXIE lost footing and came away a bit slow to begin, went three to four wide around the first turn, stayed
off the rail then came two wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ASTRONAUT bumped with STILL IN THE GAME at the start, tracked from inside then moved into the two path, drew alongside the runner-up with a furlong
to go and drove clear. STILL IN THE GAME broke in and bumped rival at the start, controlled the pace near the inside, held a short lead with a furlong to go
but yielded to the winner and bested the rest. WARBIRD chased two wide then angled in on the far turn and outdueled PHANTOM DANCE for the show
honors. PHANTOM DANCE stalked in the two path through the first turn, exited the far turn two to three wide and got edged for the show. COSMO stalked
off the rail or outside rivals, went three to four wide into the stretch and could not rally. ON EASY STREET was fractious in the gate, got bumped with
AUGUST INDY shortly after the start, settled off the pace, entered the stretch two wide and never threatened. AUGUST INDY drifted out and bumped ON
EASY STREET soon after the start, angled to the inside soon after, raced a bit off the rail up the backstretch, was eased around the far turn and down the
stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
OUR LITTLE TIGER was quickest early then chased ALLERGIC TO LOGIC on the backstretch, bid outside on the turn and headed rival past the
five-sixteenths pole, shook free in upper stretch and widened to the wire. MEDUSA'S GAZE was forwardly placed off the rail, took the turn three wide and
finished willingly to best the rest. ALLERGIC TO LOGIC chased from inside then went up to gain command, cleared rival past the nine-sixteenths,
challenged around the bend and fought back from inside to the stretch, could not kick on the winner in upper stretch and flattened out to third. SUGAR
KISSES bobbled leaving the gate, tracked three wide into the turn, moved down the two path around the bend and lacked a bid in the lane. QUEEN OF
LOVE off slow to begin, tracked from inside to the stretch and had little left. AGATA stumbled badly at the start, chased widest up the backstretch, went four
wide around the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.
