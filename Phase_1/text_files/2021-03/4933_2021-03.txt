Footnotes
IT'S MY HOUSE pressed the early pace, went four wide into the second turn, took the lead into the stretch, met the bid of TONY'S TAPIT, dueled with that
rival to late stretch, drifted in late and prevailed for the win. TONY'S TAPIT raced in mid pack early, went five wide into the second turn, made a bid on the
winner in early stretch, dueled to late stretch and finished second best. SATURDAY VALUE set a pressured early pace, went three wide into the second
turn, weakened and held for third. SUPERDUTY JUSTICE tracked the early pace, waited behind the leaders through the home turn, drifted in and was
empty late. BECKHAM JAMES was outrun early, ranged up six wide through the second turn and flattened out. DEVILS WORKSHOP was unhurried early,
raced seven wide through the second turn and offered no late rally. MR. TRIPLEDOUBLE was reserved early, circled eight wide through the second turn
and never fired. MANDREW was void of speed and was no factor. FREERUNNING stalked the early pace from the inside and retreated.
