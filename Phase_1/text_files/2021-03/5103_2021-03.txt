AWESOME DUDE was unhurried to the turn, bid three wide then swung out five wide while rallying into the stretch, continued to respond and won driving.
SIZZLING INDIAN set the pace from the rail to the stretch, was clear to mid stretch then was tiring and just saved the place. TEXAS BOB was outsprinted to
the turn while in the two path, swung outside the winner and six wide into the stretch and was finishing well. PROOF OF PARANOIA pressed the leader
while two wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. LUCKY CAUSE tracked the pace early, offered a run three wide to briefly
loom a threat into the stretch but also got outrun to mid stretch and weakened. STORMING WARRIOR had no speed, was well back while three wide to the
stretch and did not threaten. PAPA'S HONEY also had no speed and was never a threat. SARGENT LENZINI stalked the pace from the rail to the stretch
then gave way.

Footnotes
ANITANEWMERCEDES assumed command of the early pace, saved ground during the backstretch run and onto the second turn, was confronted in deep
stretch by DIRT ROAD RED but determinedly dug in to fend off that rival and get the win. DIRT ROAD RED settled midpack through the early stages, saved
ground while two wide along the second turn, advanced position coming into the stretch, swung three wide for the drive, confronted ANITANEWMERCEDES
in deep stretch but could not get by that foe, but bested the rest. JUST LIKE FRED stalked the early pace while traveling two wide, lost position coming into
the stretch and was outkicked by the top two. IRISH DECLARATION bobbled at start, settled toward the back of the field, three wide on the second turn,
finished evenly in the stretch. UNION LEADER showed no early speed, two wide on the turn, advanced position off the turn but was outfinished. AGENT
ZERO fanned four wide on first turn, settled at the rear of the field, slipped over to the rail for the run on the second turn, and had no response late. STONE
GROOVE hopped at the start, sat close to the early pace while saving ground through the backstretch and turn, was outrun on the turn, and weakened late.
