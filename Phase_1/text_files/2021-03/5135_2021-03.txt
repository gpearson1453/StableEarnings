Footnotes
KULP was well placed, early, rallied at the quarter pole and drew even, drew off late under mild urging to win going away. GRAND DEAL set the pace for
three quarters, was hooked at the quarter pole by the winner, could not match strides late but was clearly second best. MAN DOWN raced mid pack and
went evenly. TIZ VALENTINO DAZE was allowed to settle and failed to menace. TABACADABRA broke very slow and was no factor. HESITATION BLUES
raced on the inside and tired in the stretch. UNCLEJACKOMO contended for five eights, then gave way.

IMMACULATE HEART dueled on the lead from the rail, shook clear in mid stretch, remained clear late, driving. MISS SURPRISE dueled with the winner
throughout, could not match strides late but was second best. LADY KIM well placed early, lacked a late kick and went evenly. JILLY FROM JERSEY
tracked four wide and had no late bid. FANCY KELLY was no threat. PROUD MAID MARIAN raced inside and was no menace. SUN DRESS was outrun.
