Footnotes
ROYAL RUSE sat comfortably behind the leader most of the way, gained command when OFFICER SYDNEY (IRE) went off course, and remained in that
position to the wire. IT'S NOTHING settled in the third spot until the lead rival went off course to obtain second place and that was the way he finished.
OFFICER SYDNEY (IRE) took command from the start and remained there with good energy until he failed to make the left hand turn and was off course
three fences from home. AQUIES trailed the field throughout and was pulled up before the third last and walked off.

Footnotes
CHEERS TO US assumed command from the start, gave up the lead three jumps from home but stayed in close proximity over the last two fences and
regained the lead going up the hill after the last and prevailed at the wire. AWESOME ADRIAN was allowed to settle off the pace but was always in striking
distance, gained ground going down the hill heading for the third last to gain command, had the advantage over the last two fences but gave way going up
the hill towards the wire. AS YOU LIKE IT was always in contention until after the last jump when he weakened going up the hill to the finish. SOME
RESPONSE (IRE) stayed in contention for the first two miles then started to tire three fences from home.
