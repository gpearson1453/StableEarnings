Footnotes
SUMMER EXPRESS showed early speed while racing in the three path around the first turn, dropped back to settle off the pace for the run up the
backstretch, launched an outside bid from the three path around the far turn and dueled down the stretch to prevail in the final strides. WILDWOOD
MAGGIE broke slowly and swerved in mildly leaving the gate, trailed the field while saving ground through the opening half mile, began to move up from the
two path around the far turn, dueled for the lead on the inside in upper stretch, drifted in slightly and was outfinished late. BIG LUCK brushed with the horse
to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field between horses entering the backstretch, navigated the far turn still
in the two path and made a mild gain of ground in the final furlong. IRISH HALO sprinted clear to an early lead while saving ground around the first turn and
up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and faded in the stretch. EMILY BUG stumbled slightly and bumped with the horse to her
inside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the
two path, swung wide entering the stretch, and was empty from there. DUE TO TIMING MALFUNCTION, THERE IS NO TIME FOR THE THREE
QUARTER SPLIT.

Footnotes
LASTFORTINOFAMILY chased the leading pair outside of FLASHY RICHIE, began to improve in the four path past the three eighths, went to a drive
approaching the quarter, rallied three wide, led past the furlong pole and ran clear while still under a drive in the final sixteenth. ONE PUTT RICHIE broke
inward sharply and bumped FLASHY RICHIE in the opening strides, disputed the pace outside of MOMMAS BOY OTIS, proved no match between horses
when LASTFORTINOFAMILY passed inside the furlong mark, but battled on for place. MOMMAS BOY OTIS broke out and bumped CACHACO in the
opening strides, dueled inside of ONE PUTT RICHIE, went to a drive inside the lane as he continued to battle on the pace, had no answer when
LASTFORTINOFAMILY passed in midstretch, and was outfinished for place. FLASHY RICHIE was bumped soundly by ONE PUTT RICHIE in the opening
strides and was pushed into CACHACO as a result, chased the leading pair inside of LASTFORTINOFAMILY down the backstretch and in the two path on
the turn, went to a drive inside into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. CACHACO was bumped by MOMMAS BOY OTIS as that foe broke outward, was
also bumped soundly by FLASHY RICHIE as part of a chain reaction caused by ONE PUTT RICHIE breaking inward, settled in the rear pair inside of WAR
TRAIL early, raced in the two to three path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, mustered no rally and weakened late. WAR TRAIL stumbled out of
the gate, hit the gate, settled at the rear, raced in the four path on the turn and made no bid in the lane.

HALO HUNTER led the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off to win handily.
CONTRACTION bobbled slightly leaving the gate, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and drifted out down
the stretch while proving to be the best of the rest. LONG STATION chased the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around
the turn in the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. GO FOR SHERRIE settled just behind the leader between horses in the early going, raced in the
two path around the turn, was in tight quarters near the eighth pole when CONTRACTION drifted out and weakened from there.

Z U AT THE RACES chased the leading trio six wide early, continued four wide on the turn, responded with a bid when asked near the three eighths pole,
was driven to the lead past the three sixteenths, and drew clear. EDISON FIRE settled in second last, angled out past the three eighths and was pushed
along, came four wide into the lane, sustained a bid despite the rider losing his crop, proved no match for the winner but held FINAL CALL at bay for the
place. FINAL CALL settled at the rear near the center of the track early, trailed in the six path on the turn, raced five wide into the lane, moved further out
and was driven near the center of the track in the lane, kept on with interest under a drive but was outfinished for place. KING'S STORY set the pace while
pressured early, edged clear into the turn and led in the two path on the bend, went to a drive in upper stretch, was headed by Z U AT THE RACES past the
three sixteenths, and weakened inside. MACHO CLASSIC chased behind the leading trio early, advanced to track the leading pair approaching the half mile
mark, was pushed along while saving ground around the bend, raced at the inside of the chasing flight into the lane and offered no rally. MOON FLASH
pressed the leader between horses early, tracked the pace into the turn, continued two wide around the bend, came into the lane between horses and came
up empty. COLIDA tracked outside the leading pair five wide early, chased three wide between horses on the turn, was driven three wide between horses
into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
MIND TRAPPE settled in behind the leaders for the run up the backstretch, began his bid from the two path approaching the three eighths pole, kicked clear
with a furlong to go and extended his lead to the wire. MINISTER'S GLORY was pinched back and blocked leaving the gate, trailed the field up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and gained ground on the outside in late stretch. TWO PAIR stumbled slightly leaving the gate, raced off
the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and improved position between horses while drifting out some in the stretch.
SOUTHSIDER raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, began to move up while saving ground around the turn, and finished evenly while never
threatening the top finishers. SEANSHINE led the field from the rail up the backstretch and around the turn, dueled in upper stretch and tired in the final
furlong. PABLO DEL MONTE stalked the leader up the backstretch, navigated the turn alternating between the two and three paths and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
APOLLO U ANYWHERE was sent for speed and set a pressured pace, saved ground around the turn, responded when driven to assert her lead in upper
stretch, and held sway to the finish. POLLY WAR CRY bobbled out of the gate, settled toward the rear well off the inside early, chased in the four path on
the turn, swung out and went to a drive in the eight path in the lane, rallied and got up for the place in the final strides. LUSCIOUS was bumped in the
opening strides by COOKIN ROSES, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch, continued to track three wide on the turn, went to a drive in upper
stretch, proved no match for APOLLO U ANYWHERE, and lost second in the final strides. COLOROFACLOUD settled inside of RULER DAENERYS early,
saved ground near the rear on the turn, was driven inside foes in upper stretch, and chased evenly late. APRIL'S GEM chased midpack down the
backstretch and in the two to three path on the turn, went to a drive past the quarter pole, altered out past the furlong mark to get around the fading COOKIN
ROSES, and proved empty from there. COOKIN ROSES broke inward and bumped LUSCIOUS in the opening strides, pressed the pace outside the leader
down the backstretch and between horses on the turn, was driven into the lane, but could not keep pace with the winner and weakened. RULER
DAENERYS settled at the rear, trailed in the two path on the turn, offered no bid and was not persevered with late.

OIL MONEY was pushed to the early lead, showed the way the entire way around the oval, raced in the two path around the turn, turned back a challenge
from TRAPPE VALLEY in upper stretch and maintained his advantage to the wire. TRAPPE VALLEY chased the leader up the backstretch, began a mild
bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole, dueled briefly in upper stretch and was outkicked from there, the best of the rest. LIBERAL LUNACY
brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, made a mild gain of
ground entering the stretch and was never a threat while drifting out mildly down the lane. INDIAN SIGN brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the
gate, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid.

MISTER CHARMING broke in and bumped DARK WOOD in the opening strides, tracked the pace down the backstretch, saved ground in the pocket on the
turn, came into the lane still inside and behind TALIS PARK GRAD, switched two wide past the three sixteenths, ran on doggedly outside the leader and got
up in the final strides. TALIS PARK GRAD broke inward, was sent for pace inside, set a pressured pace down the backstretch and in the two path on the
turn, went to a drive approaching the three sixteenths, kept on but was caught in the final strides. LONESOME DREAM was bumped by UPHAM in the
opening strides, tracked the pace outside of that foe down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, was driven three wide into the lane, and chased
on willingly while no match for the top two. UPHAM hit the gate while breaking outward, bumped LONESOME DREAM in the opening strides, prompted the
pace outside of TALIS PARK GRAD down the backstretch and in the three path between horses on the turn, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, proved
no match in upper stretch and weakened late. SQUIRRELY MIKE settled at the rear of a tight main pack early, raced in the four path outside of PACKED
HOUSE on the turn, and offered no rally in the lane. DARK WOOD (IRE) was bumped in the opening strides by MISTER CHARMING, soon trailed the field,
raced in the four path well behind the main field in the four path on the turn, swung out toward the center of the track for the stretch run, but lacked the
needed rally. PACKED HOUSE broke sharply but settled back toward the rear of a compact main field, raced toward the rear in the three path on the turn,
and faded past the quarter pole.
