wasn't far back along the inside, was blocked while trying to vie inside the winner in early stretch, moved inside that one once clear after five furlongs but
wasn't enough. UNCLE MANNY raced two wide between horses with the pace and weakened late. MOTATAABEQ made the early pace outside, raced
three wide with the pace into the final furlong and weakened. SUPPRESS wasn't far back four wide to the stretch then tired. BUSCH LATTE trailed and was

SWEET MESA broke slowly, fell far back early, stayed along the rail while rallying and quickly ran clear through late stretch. MADE TO HUSTLE chased the
early leader, raced two wide around the turn, took over from the outside leaving the furlong grounds, held a clear lead into the final sixteenth but was little
match late. LA LENA opened a clear lead soon after the break, angled to the inside then gave way in the lane. EIGHT DANZAS raced four wide into the
turn, angled in leaving the three-eighths pole causing WILD DELIGHT to clip heels, moved closer in early stretch then flattened out. Following a stewards'
inquiry, EIGHT DANZAS was disqualified and placed seventh. TINDER DATE steadied along the rail early on the turn, angled out approaching the lane and
failed to menace. TAK E LADY wasn't far back early, raced the three path around the turn and stopped. COME ON LET'S RIDE steadied two wide between
rivals early on the turn, came out wide nearing the stretch then stopped. WILD DELIGHT steadied early on the turn when EIGHT DANZAS dropped in front
of her, clipped that one's heels and fell.

slow early, raced three wide around the turn, swung wide into the stretch and finished fast outside. CAMGO advanced the three path around the turn but

RINGS OF JUPITER was rated in good position in the three path, took over in early stretch and held after a long drive. BELLOWS was caught in tight along
the rail while trying to rally into the far turn, remained behind foes into the stretch, bid between horses once clear but wasn't enough. FINANCIAL FREEDOM
opened a clear lead nearing the first turn, stayed out from the rail while in control into the stretch then gave way. GEMS MINESHAFT RVF lagged early,
rallied the rail around the final turn, found room to vie into the final furlong but hung. WARLEGGAN was slow early, made a wide run around the final turn
then flattened out in the drive. YO NO SE stayed inside and failed to menace. CLINIC was caught wide around the first turn then failed to matter. MICKEY T
wasn't far back outside into the far turn then stopped.
