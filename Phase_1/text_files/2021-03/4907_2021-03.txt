DIVINE EXCHANGE antsy in gate and bothered at the start while slow early with no late bid in the stretch. DREAM TO WIN bore out start, never factored
thereafter. STORM CHARGING prompted pace from two path but gave way and yielded through the stretch.

WILL KNOWS off slow, lagged back to turn, rallied with outside late surge to just get up on the wire under steady handling. SANDHILL SAMMY vied from
inside, cleared into stretch but could not last kept the place spot late. TORAZO awkward start, raced back to the turn, rallied with a late rush for the show
spot just missing second. SUPREME VENTURE tracked trio to turn outside but leveled off in the stretch run. NORTH ELKHORN raced evenly throughout
with no late response when needed. PEPPERMINT ZIP off slow, behind speed to turn with no late run while evenly from the turn. LIMEHOUSEGAS vied
three wide to turn, stayed well to deep stretch and emptied out. RED BLUE AND TRUE never factored. DRAGON DREW speed between horses to turn,
gave way readily.

Footnotes
VISITANT slow into stride, launched a run out of the turn, roused and finished with a rush to be along in time under stout handling. WHAT'S UP DUDE
tracked inside, chased out of turn, got thru stretch, led late but nailed on wire with a good effort. ANOTHER MIRACLE knocked off stride at the start,
recovered, three path run into turn but leveled off in the drive. AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) sprinted to set pace to deep stretch but faltered in the late going.
GLENNWOOD never far back, perfect position while inside thru the stretch run with no late gain. EAGLE SONG (IRE) bounced around start, floated widest
into stretch with no late gain. HURRICANE HIGHWAY never far back to turn, floated wide into stretch and also faded back. HOLIDAY STONE chased pace
from two path to quarter pole but faded back in the stretch. CULLUM ROAD always back.

in the late going but was outfinished. SNAKE BITE unhurried early, steady run to far turn, finished up well but too late. U S DELTA FORCE quick from
outside to lead, pressured mid stretch and faltered late. CREALOCK tracked off rail to far turn with no late gain in the stretch run. DOM CAETANO (ARG)
steadied first turn, far back to quarter pole and only improved mildly late. CHANNEL STUFFER never far back while outside past the quarter pole, and
faded. KNIGHT FROST well placed inside down backstretch with no late response when needed. ITASCA pushed around from gate and never a menace.
