Footnotes
LIME sat behind the trio of battling leaders around the turn, angled widest into the stretch, rallied steadily and was up outside SIMPLY THE BEST to finish
on equal terms. SIMPLY THE BEST vied outside LADIES' CHOICE and BABY MO from the start, and stayed on with good courage between horses to
share the win. LADIES' CHOICE vied inside BABY MO and SIMPLY THE BEST from the outset, and yielded on the rail late. BABY MO contested the pace
between horses from the start to mid stretch, and weakened. AWILDAS TREASURE was no factor inside. TWIRLING GRACE came out two lengths slow,
and raced far back. MARIMBA broke two lengths slow, and was always outrun.

Footnotes
NICHOLAS ROSE settled off the early pace along the inside, closed inside, seized command inside of the pacesetter nearing the sixteenth pole and drove
clear. FRANK ALONE set the early pace along the rail, came out a bit into the two path leaving the five-sixteenths pole, led between foes to the sixteenth
marker and held well to preserve the place. I KICKN advanced four wide around the turn, bid in upper stretch and flattened out a bit in the final furlong.
DIAMONDS ENJOY pressed the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. BABY BROTHER raced off the pace three wide, angled five wide in upper
stretch and never threatened. NO NAY MAYBE (IRE) pressed the pace two wide between foes and retreated nearing the lane. DREAM D'ORO chased the
pace two wide, swung six wide near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a closing bid. SAGE CANYON trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
BLAKENSTEIN sped to the front after the start, showed the way to the stretch in the two-path, and was kept to steady pressure. COMISKEY PARK pursued
BLAKENSTEIN from outside all the way, and saved the place while drifting out. HERE COMES BULLET was under a drive four wide outside the
quarter-pole, stayed on with good courage but could not improve position. TRINNI JOHN broke a step slowly, swung four wide approaching the stretch, and
made no progress. JUPITER BLUES pressed the early pace, and dropped back inside around the turn. PACHANGA PATROL lunged at the start spotting
the field two to three lengths, and had no response to urging on the turn. DEBBIE'S ROAD broke alertly but stumbled a stride out, dropped back losing
contact with the field early, and jogged in.

Footnotes
MO FAITH tracked the leaders near the inside for six furlongs, bid between horses past the eighth-pole, and finished gamely to get up outside VOODOO
ZIP near the wire. VOODOO ZIP tugged his way along under a stout hold outside BEAR ALLEY through the first half-mile, poked a head in front
approaching the stretch, edged clear briefly through the furlong grounds, then yielded the lead in the closing yards. SMALL TALK raced in striking range two
to three wide for six furlongs, and finished with good courage outside the top two. ABSAM got sandwiched between DERBY DATE and THIRSTY OWL
shortly after the start, advanced three then four wide around the far turn, and could gain only mildly through the lane. BEAR ALLEY set the pace inside for
nearly six furlongs, and weakened through the stretch. TIMEFORAWOODFORD was moving his head around at the break and came out two lengths or so
behind the others, and never reached contention. DERBY DATE came out, bumped with ABSAM and steadied soon after the start, and was never
prominent. LIAM'S BOY raced three wide and tired before reaching the stretch. THIRSTY OWL bumped solidly with ABSAM after the start, and was outrun.

Footnotes
MISTA DONZELLA bumped with OPTIMISTIC VALOR at the start, sat in the pocket saving ground behind the pacesetters for six furlongs, moved to the
two-path getting roused at the top of the stretch, overhauled the leader from outside near the eighth-pole and kicked clear. KICKS ON SIXTY SIX went
along in the second flight two to three wide to the stretch, and finished well on the outside. HACHACHA settled in the middle of the field early, took the far
turn three then four wide, ran on willingly between rivals through the furlong grounds but was outkicked for the place. MY MAXAMILLION was slow into
stride, was forced to go four then five wide around the far turn, and could only improve position mildly. OPTIMISTIC VALOR was bumped between horses at
the start, set a moderate pace inside to the stretch, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. GOLOVKIN saved ground waiting for clearance on the
far turn, and could not gain when roused. BACH bumped with OPTIMISTIC VALOR at the start, was reserved early inside, and made no impact.
COWARDLY ACT fought rating prompting the pace outside, and was empty when asked approaching the stretch.

SEPTEMBERTEN settled off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up in deep stretch. AUGUSTA MELODY
bumped with WELL DONE WEST at the start, pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, drew clear in upper stretch and
led until deep stretch. WELL DONE WEST bumped with AUGUSTA MELODY at the start, advanced three wide around the turn but was no match for the
top two in the lane. MY MAN FLINTSTONE tracked the pace two wide and came up empty in the lane. MUSTANG CAT played no factor while racing three
wide. CHILL HAZE set the pace along the rail and was through after a half. TONALISM was fractious in the post parade and behind the starting gate, tried
to duck in at the start, was taken firmly in hand, angled out and trailed.

SPEND BENJAMINS quickly sprinted to a clear lead, rated along inside to the stretch, and responded when roused to maintain the advantage. ENSIGN
PARKER bumped with OUR HOISTED MAST at the start, was held up saving ground behind the leaders on the turn, swung three wide for clearance at the
top of the stretch, finished willingly but could not reach the winner. TODAYSTHEDAY broke outward, chased the pacesetter near the two-path on the turn,
moved inside for the drive and was one-paced to the finish. EXCHANGE DAY broke inward, edged closer to the leader three then two wide around the turn,
and weakened through the furlong grounds between horses. DEPUTY INDY was in tight at the start, moved off the inside to the three-path on the turn, and
could not threaten in an even effort. JACKSON STRONG bumped with OUR HOISTED MAST and steadied in tight at the start, and was no menace two to
three wide. OUR HOISTED MAST was bumped between horses and steadied back at the start, and was never prominent.

POLICY OPTION settled off the pace while racing three wide around the first turn, made good progress four wide around the far turn, seized command near
the eighth pole, dug in inside of SHINING THROUGH and held sway under a drive. SHINING THROUGH raced well back two and three wide, swung out in
upper stretch, rallied outside, bid outside of the winner leaving the eighth pole but could not get past. CALL BROS settled two wide in midpack, swung out in
upper stretch but was blocked, angled back in in a vain search for room, finally found clear sailing in deep stretch and was up for the show.
THREENINETYTWO saved ground in range, tipped two wide to split rivals near the quarter pole, led in upper stretch, vied past the eighth pole then
weakened. BODIE CODY saved ground and failed to menace. DREAMIN OF SEVILLE saved ground off the pace, went four wide around the far turn and
never threatened. LEADING FACTOR set the pace along the rail and tired in the drive. BARBIE'S KING played no factor while racing two wide. ALWAYS
MISBEHAVING was in range four wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. WHERE YA GOIN OWEN pressed the
