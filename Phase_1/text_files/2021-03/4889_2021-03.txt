well. MO PARTY broke slowly, advanced inside and flattened out in the stretch. CLOUT CHASER prompted the pace outside then began fading on the turn.

spot. KIT KAT KATIE was bumped at the start and steadied, moved up early on the inside to set the pace, dueled between rivals in the stretch drive and
weakened late. IWASBORNAWINNER chased between rivals early, raced two wide on the turn, bid at the quarter pole and finished evenly. GO METRO
GIRL chased outside, raced three wide on the turn and tired. I'AM A UNICORN broke out bumping rivals at the start, vied two wide early, then chased and
faded. A Jockey Objection by the rider of KIT KAT KATIE against the second place finisher alleging interference at the start, was dismissed.

DAKOTA OUTLAW took control inside, vied from the three eighths pole to the wire and prevailed in a determined effort. ANGRY AMERICAN moved to
collar the leader into the far turn then battled to the finish but could not get by the winner. EDDIE'S CHARGE lacked speed in the two path and made a
gradual late gain. LONGTAIL settled just behind the pacesetters early then gave way in the stretch. ILOVECHARLYBROWN bumped at the start, raced
wide and far back and was no factor. HORSE BE WITH YOU prompted the pace three wide for a quarter mile and stopped. FRED'S GONEFISHING lagged
well behind inside and stopped abruptly.
