Footnotes
CHASING FAME vied for the lead outside a pair of rivals then cleared leaving the backstretch, inched away in upper stretch, urged right-handed in deep
stretch and lasted. NERVES OF STEEL showed early speed inside the top pair then dropped into a stalking position, traveled two then three wide around
the turn, shifted in upper stretch and was quickly corrected, closed fast outside the winner and missed. JUNE GLOOM off a bit slow then steadied when
bothered by inside rival, stalked off the rail, gained ground into the turn, came three wide into the stretch, lacked the needed late kick but stayed on to
preserve the show. GERLACH'S in range early from inside, saved ground then shifted two wide into the stretch, kept on through the final furlong and filled
out the superfecta. IMISSBAYMEADOWS vied between early then inside the winner, chased that rival from inside to the stretch and weakened. ARREST off
slow to begin, traveled three wide around the turn then swung four wide into the stretch, shifted out at the eighth pole then lugged inward in the final
sixteenth while improving position. TODAY MATTERS raced mid-pack through the early stages, traveled two then three wide around the turn and offered no
response. PEDRO PEREZ chased in the two path and outside a rival on the turn, entered the stretch three wide, steadied late when ARREST was lugging
in and weakened. BARACKO off a bit slow and was bothered by inside rival at the start, angled to the inside, trailing the field and never got involved. CALL
NINE ONE ONE raced off the pace and steered to the two path, exited the bend two to three wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
TRIPLE TAP pressed BARRAZA from outside, dueled around the turn, shook free in upper stretch and drew away in the final furlong under hand urging.
BARRAZA pulled and was hard to manage behind the top pair up the backstretch, moved inside into the turn, came out into the stretch, could not threaten
the winner but was clearly second best. EYES OPEN set the pace under pressure from TRIPLE TAP, dueled with that rival around the turn, fought to upper
stretch and could not go on with the top pair inside the furlong grounds. IVORY SKY was off a bit slow to begin, stalked the top pair from outside, went three
wide around the bend and weakened.

by that same foe drifting out nearing the sixteenth pole, then edged clear in the closing moments. GOOD WITH PEOPLE sped to the front from inside, led
clear into the drive, responded when challenged inside the furlong grounds, drifted out and bumped with the winner nearing the sixteenth pole and yielded
late. GATOR SHINING off slow to begin, chased from inside then steered out at the five-sixteenths, entered the stretch two to three wide and finished
willingly. POSITIVITY stalked the speed outside rivals, went two wide into the turn then moved to the rail leaving the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
LITTLEBITAMEDAL bumped with inside and rival and steadied when rival came over early, settled off the pace, came five wide into the stretch, rallied
widest and drew clear inside the sixteenth pole. POSTERIZE broke in and brushed rival, had early speed outside the leader then chased that foe into and
around the turn, took aim three wide into the stretch, gained control and led clear to the eighth pole but could not match the winner late. CAMBY tracked off
the inside, closed in three then four wide around the turn and finished willingly for the show honors. DARK HEDGES traveled mid-pack up the backstretch,
two wide through the turn, was within striking distance in the drive but needed to find more. MR. LOVEJOY brushed from outside in the beginning, set the
pace then cleared outside rival on the backstretch, led two wide into the lane, relinquished control in upper stretch and gave way. FANTASTIC DAY bumped
and steadied early, took the turn four then five wide and proved no menace. ELEKTRONIC chased the speed from inside then a bit off the rail leaving the
bend and weakened.

Footnotes
BIG BUZZ up close outside the leader early, bid alongside at the seven-sixteenths, dueled around the far turn and down the stretch, battled through the final
furlong and was all out to prevail. MEDIA BLITZ set the pace from inside, met challenge at the seven-sixteenths marker and dueled around the far turn and
into the stretch, fought gamely from inside through the final furlong and finished gamely to the wire. TROPICAL TERROR bothered by GOLDEN STAR
ROCK leaving the gate, angled inside that rival and stalked from inside, moved into the two path leaving the final bend and went one-paced through the
drive. SHAZIER brushed the outside part of the gate and came away last, moved to the inside and saved ground trailing the field then moved into the two
path on the final turn and gained a minor award. GOLDEN STAR ROCK drifted out at the start, chased the speed outside a rival in the two path and never
responded to asking.

Footnotes
GREGORIAN CHANT (GB) unhurried in the early going, traveled outside a rival then advanced while easing further off rail around the turn, rallied widest
and closed in outside a trio of rivals at the eighth pole, dueled with SOMBEYAY in deep stretch and dug in to edged that rival. SOMBEYAY stalked the pace
from inside then two wide into the stretch, tipped out at the top of the lane, struck the front with a furlong to go, dueled with the winner in the late stages and
finished gamely to the line. JOLIE OLIMPICA (BRZ) away quickly from outside, dueled with CISTRON for command, held a short lead in upper stretch then
was overtaken with a furlong to go, then stayed on to hold the show. CISTRON chased JOLIE OLIMPICA early then went up to challenge for the lead,
dueled into and around the turn, could not match strides with the top pair in the final furlong and was outfinished for the show honors. BARRISTAN THE
BOLD (GB) stumbled and broke in at the start, saved ground around the turn and never rallied. BOB AND JACKIE stalked outside a rival then two to three
wide around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SWISS SKYDIVER chased the leader from inside, angled three wide leaving the second turn, surged clear in upper stretch and drew away under a crack of
the left hand and strong handling late. AS TIME GOES BY settled off the pace, traveled three to four wide around the far turn, came five wide into the
stretch, finished well but was unable to threaten the winner. GOLDEN PRINCIPAL sped clear to establish the front, set all the pace to the stretch, offered
little resistance when challenged by the winner and flattened to third. HARVEST MOON stalked outside the leader, coaxed midway through the second
bend, spun four wide turning for home and weakened. THIS TEA angled into the two path early, tracked two wide then angled to the rail around the far turn
and lacked a rally. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE traveled four then three wide around the first time, stayed off the rail then angled in a bit around the far turn,
steered back out into the stretch and further out in the lane, then offered no response when called upon. MISS STORMY D raced off the inside in range of
the pacesetter, lost ground three wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BENCH JUDGE bumped with outside rival at the start, sped to the front then cleared CAERULEAN, challenged again by that rival around the turn, dueled
around the turn and into the stretch, fought back gamely along the fence and edged clear late. CAERULEAN showed early speed outside BENCH JUDGE
then chased the pacesetter to the turn, bid alongside and dueled around the turn and into the stretch, held a short lead over the winner to mid-stretch and
flattened out a bit in deep stretch. TABLE FOR TEN tossed his head and came away last, saved ground from inside then tipped out into the stretch, rallied
and got up for the show honors. FIRST PREZ broke through the gate and was reloaded, angled inside and chased along the fence, traveled a bit off the rail
into the drive and got nailed for the show. BEAUDACIOUS brushed inner rival at the start, stalked between foes then two to three wide around the turn and
finished evenly in the late stages. LUVLUV bumped both sides and got squeezed at the start, settled off the pace, moved out in the stretch and could not
rally. HANDSOME CAT broke through the gate prior to the start, settled inside, cut the corner into the stretch and also lacked a rally. MYSTERIOUS
STONES chased outside rivals, three to four wide around the turn and faded. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK tracked in mid-pack up the backstretch, drifted out
on the turn and had little left. AFTERNOON HEAT dropped back early, entered the turn three wide then angled into the two path and was never a factor.
