finished evenly and lacked a rally. SONG SPECTACULAR pressed the early pace and weakened. CHATUSA challenged for the early lead, saved ground
around the turn and faded. RACE FOR DADDY raced evenly near the back and showed little. ALL OUT WAR trailed throughout and was outrun. PER

Footnotes
RUNPEGGYRUN stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up on the inside, dueled briefly with LUCKY LITTLE LADY, pulled away down the stretch
and proved the best. TOTALLY GRACE pressed the early pace, eased back, split rivals down the stretch, made a late bid and was a clear second. LUCKY
LITTLE LADY went to the front, drove clear and lacked a finish. MAIDEN ROCK raced evenly near the middle of the field in the beginning, made a mild bid
and was outfinished for third. SAINT KENNEDY raced within contention, saved ground around the final turn, weakened and was no threat late. AMERICAN
MOM always raced near the back and showed little. I DONT KNOW EITHER trailed throughout and was outrun.

forth a game effort. SUGAR PIE STREET broke in, pressed the pace, raced close throughout and was outfinished. PAC FOR HAWAII raced within striking
distance and put forth an even effort. SOCIAL GALAXY pressed the early pace and weakened. SPECTACULAR IZZY broke slow, shut off and was never a

Footnotes
ALLTHEWAYWITHTAYE went to the front, drove clear, dueled down the lane and prevailed for the win. COLONEL PIKE pressed the pace, moved up
around the turn and challenged the leader, dueled down the stretch and was outfinished for the win. SIDNEY'S HOPE raced near the back in the beginning,
made a late bid and closed willingly. SR. CLARKY raced near the middle of the field, made a bid, was outfinished, while putting forth a game try. LUNAR
LIGHT lacked early speed and was never a factor. ROYAL REALITY raced within contention, faded and was no threat late. REECE'S PRIORITY broke
slow, quickly rushed up and dropped back.

Footnotes
UNWANTED INTRUDER stalked the leaders in the early going, angled out around the final turn, rallied down the stretch and proved the best late. VENN
dueled for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, took the advantage down the home stretch, but couldn't hold off the winner late. MEDITATE raced
within contention, came around the final turn on the outside, dueled down the lane and was outfinished by the top two. TUNE MY GUITAR lacked early
speed, saved ground around the second turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. PURIM KING void of early speed, moved up, finished evenly and was no
factor. LIAM SKYE raced evenly near the back and showed little. SMILING SONG vied for the early lead and was finished early. REAL BRAVE broke in
steadied, raced within contention, being rank, dropped back down the backside and was pulled up. Walked off.

Footnotes
A ROYAL ACE pressed the pace, took the advantage around the turn, drove clear down the lane and finished well. PERFECT JUSTICE raced within
striking distance, came around the turn on the outside, made a bid and was a clear second at the wire. QUEEN SHASTA vied for the early advantage,
forwardly placed throughout, but couldn't keep up with the top two. CHEROKEE BLESS void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor.
JENNIFER'S ARCH lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. DIGNITYTO INFINITY lacked early speed and passed tired ones. CARLETTA
raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. JOE G'S PAYBACK showed early speed, saved ground around the turn and faded. ROSE RUNNER
flashed brief speed, saved ground and dropped back. HURRICANE TIZWAY raced near the middle of the field in the early part, retreated and was outrun.
