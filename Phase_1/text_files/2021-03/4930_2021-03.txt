CONGA BOY was unruly in the post parade unseating his rider, stalked the pace while three wide on the backstretch into the turn, rallied and powered to
the front and drew away in late stretch. KERRYSTONE stalked the pace while four wide into the turn, rallied and was gaining ground to be second best. A
HUNK OF HEAVEN was saving ground on the turn then rallied then was three wide in the stretch, was gaining ground but just missed the place in the end.
WINGS FOR ENO set the early pace then dueled while inside on the turn, was used up then gave way. SASSAGRASS pressed the early pace while two
wide then dueled for the lead on the turn, was hard used then faltered in the drive. A FEW DOLLARS MORE raced two wide on the turn then failed to
menace. CRAZY RIDGE trailed inside throughout.

GETALOADOFTHIS set a well handled pace then drew clear on the turn, was clearly much the best in the end. LARCH was settled then rallied four wide in
the stretch, closed ground willingly in late stretch but was too late. ROYAL PRIVACY rallied three wide on the turn making a bid but was no menace in the
end. GRAND ROYALE was unhurried early then rallied four wide in the stretch but was no threat. ZMOR ARISTOCAT was inside then made a mild rally and
was no threat. COCO TIGER broke through the gate prior to the start then was reloaded and chased the pace while inside, was used up and gave way.
