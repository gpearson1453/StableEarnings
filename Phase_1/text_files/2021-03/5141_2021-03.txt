Footnotes
AHIMELECH made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace unchallenged while getting quick fractions and won under mild urging. CENTRIST inside,
shifted to the five path entering the stretch and finished clear for second. ROMPED stalked the pace in an even effort. FRITTONS GOLD slow early, had a
mild late rally in the six path through the stretch. KINGS HIGHWAY failed to menace. LATIN SPICE settled mid pack then lacked the needed response.
GUCCISSIMO was no threat. OUR TIME was no factor. KITTEN'S MAN was outrun. ARROGANT MAN was hustled along to chased the winner into the
turn, got out, stopped and was eased to the wire.

BALLROOM BLITZ chased the pace into the far turn, surged to the front with a rapid move two wide then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the
best under a hand ride. THURSDAY FROST sprinted to the lead along the inside soon after the start, set the pace into the far turn then was no match for
the winner. DANCING GRACE never far back, offered a bid three wide on the second turn then leveled off. QUEEN HIGH inside, failed to respond.
CONGRATS JENSEN stalked the early pace and was through after a half. CAN I GO TOO was no threat. TREASURE WILBURNYA trailed, stopped on the
far turn and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
PACIFIC IMAGE dueled for the lead two wide until deep stretch and edged clear late under brisk handling. SHACKLESON battled with the winner along the
inside until deep stretch and finished second best. KRAMMY BOY allowed to settle, swung wide and closed a gap late in the six path. SOUL OF
DISCRETION stalked the dueling leaders into the turn, loomed boldly along the rail past the five sixteenths marker, was in tight, shifted to the five path and
lost ground. ELWOOD'S ADVICE failed to menace. VEYA passed tiring rivals. GOOD MORNING JACK had brief speed. LABYRINTH was outrun.
SWITHER'S SHORTCUT was no threat. DREAM SATURDAY had speed into the turn then gave way.
