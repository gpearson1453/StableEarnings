run along the rail around the turn and was up for the place. HIGHWAYTWENTYSEVEN chased in the two path and tired. BAYTOWN GLORY was close up

DROSSELMOON moved to command from the inside midway on the backstretch and continued with good courage through the lane. ATLANTIC CHILL
made the early pace, continued forwardly along the inside into the stretch but lacked a rally. OBROTHER ITSYLVIA lagged early, raced four wide around
the turn and gained mildly. LAWYER ROY showed speed between horses to the turn then tired. BRIDOLOGIST wasn't far back two wide between horses
into the turn then stopped.

Footnotes
P JS SILVER DUKE was reluctant to load, was shuffled back along the rail entering the far turn, remained inside, moved to vie into the final furlong, was
bumped late and prevailed. A HUGE CHECKPOINT ran out into PYLON while showing speed into the first turn, stayed out from the rail while in control,
bumped with STORY OF THE NIGHT in early stretch, held gamely into late stretch, came in, bumped the winner and faltered. STORY OF THE NIGHT was
caught wide while unhurried around the first turn, made a four wide run into the far turn, bumped with A HUGH CHECKPOINT while vying outside that one
in early stretch then weakened. MIDDLE EARTH ran't far back along the inside into the far turn and weakened in the lane. BIRD RULER had position three
wide for over six furlongs then stopped. PYLON was bumped while racing outside the early leader into the first turn, remained prominent two wide into the
far turn then stopped. GOLDEN ZAR stopped after five furlongs and was eased up.

PRIDE IN THE BIZ settled, rallied the rail around the final turn, ran out while drawing clear into the stretch and widened under mild urging. HEAVENLY
HATTIE lagged early, rallied four wide to vie on the final turn but couldn't stay with the winner in the lane. GIZMO'S PRINCESS stalked outside the early
leader in the three path, offered a mild bid on the final turn then flattened out. NATURALLY QUICK made the early pace in the two path and stopped in the
lane. QUEEN STINKER stumbled a stride out of the gate and unseated the rider.
