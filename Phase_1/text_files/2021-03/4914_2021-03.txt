Footnotes
IKE LIKES off a step slow, raced back early as a result, two path through much of the turn, set down for the drive, rallied from between rivals to be up in
time. CHEWY CHEWY GOOD prompted the pace while racing off the inside, floated out to be four wide turning into the stretch, bid, could not match the
winner late, saved the place. CINCO WEST one paced inside behind the two leaders, moved out a bit for the drive, bid midstretch, also proved no match for
the winner late, outkicked for the place. AS REQUIRED went one paced throughout while racing three wide. SOUPER CAPACITY bobbled after the start,
settled in mid pack, improved slightly in lacking a serious late kick. TANGO CINCO broke alertly, soon got clear, set the pace for a half, floated foe out into
the lane, weakened the final furlong. WICKED CHOCOLATE failed to menace. MYSTICAL MATILDA was never a threat outside. CARRILLO STREET was
off slowly, always outrun.

Footnotes
PERFECT ICE STORM in the second flight off the inside, two path into the lane, engaged the leader with less than a furlong remaining off the inside, wore
that rival down with steady handling. RAHWAY forwardly placed and three wide into the first turn, clear in the run up the backstretch while in hand,
continued to show the way through the second turn just off the inside, responded when the winner came alongside inside the furlong grounds, gave ground
grudgingly, well clear for the place. DESCENTE settled off the pace and the inside, one paced in the two path, had nothing for the top pair the final furlong.
BOSSY BRIDE was never dangerous while racing three wide. CHAMPAGNE HORIZON went one paced throughout while saving ground, lacked closing
response. INDIAN BELLA pressed early along the inside, began a steady fade before a half. POTRA LIZA off slow, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
I'M A SPECIAL STAR broke alertly, set the pace toward the inside, shrugged off a couple of foes into the stretch, stayed well clear to the wire under steady
urging. STONE SECRET bumped just after the start, moved up steadily the opening quarter, loomed a threat three wide late in the turn, could do little with
the winner in the run to the wire, remained clearly second best. COACH DAN bumped early, raced back in the early going, three wide turning for home,
staged a mild rally, traffic a sixteenth out, up for the show. FUNANDFUNNY turned in an even effort, lacked a closing kick. PAPA JIMMY in midpack while
racing just off the inside, went evenly through the lane. KING OF THE RING off a step slow, raced back, passed tiring foes while never a threat. BIKER TIM
closest to the leader, moved slightly closer in the turn off the inside and between foes late in the bend, faltered in the drive. CONGO'S TALE broke out and a
bit slowly, trailed much of the way, was never a factor. DRYSPELL back off the pace and the inside, was finished after three furlongs.

Footnotes
TOO PRETTY never far back off the inside, moved closer in the three path far turn, put a head in front turning into the stretch, clear when straightened for
home. HISSY MISSY lacked early foot, began to advance in the two path through the second turn, split foes past the furlong, dropped to the inside soon
after and finished up willingly to be getting to the winner inside that one. ZANSHOES off slow while breaking toward the outside, steadied in some traffic
early in the first turn, moved out to be four wide onto the backstretch, advanced while remaining in the four path second turn, flattened out a bit in the drive
while remaining clear of the others. TURNSTONE lacked speed while saving ground in the first turn, moved out, raced four out to five wide into the lane,
widest for the drive while improving position. STARRGARITA in mid pack while well wide first turn, continued outside, four wide again through the second
turn, improved position a bit while not posing a serious threat. MARY ALICE in the main body off the inside, went one paced throughout in lacking a closing
response. LOVELY LOU within striking distance toward the inside, angled out four to five wide turning for home, came up empty for the drive. MOCHA KISS
settled off the pace and the inside, never a threat. WARM BEAUTY was finished early. LUCKY ROAD broke on top, soon well clear, set the pace until
headed far turn and stopped. FIVE STAR MOON chased the leader early, challenged far turn, briefly led, also stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
CALCULATED RISKER never far back while in the two path, pressed the issue up the backstretch, called on for some run to duel into the far turn, narrowly
showed the way into the stretch, drove well clear the in the final furlong. GHOSTLY WHO broke on top, set the pace along the inside while firmly in hand,
dueled into and through the final turn inside the winner, continued on equal terms with that one until midstretch then could not keep up. OFF SIXES lacked
speed outside, advanced four out to five wide into the lane, long drive for the show. KRISTO forwardly placed inside, checked up in traffic first turn,
continued to save ground into and through the final bend, came up empty when called on for the drive. LITTLE NO WAY settled off the pace and the inside,
moved closer when asked along while three wide and in some traffic second turn, flattened out from between horses in the drive. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT in
the main body while racing well off the inside, four wide through the first turn, continued outside, closer when four wide once again second turn, hung in the
drive. STUART HALL lacked speed off the inside, failed to menace. SINGANDCRYINDUBAI prompted the pace from the three path for almost six furlongs
then began to give way. DETERMINANT was off a step slow, moved up a bit the opening quarter then was finished after a half. WICKETS WAY off slow,
trailed throughout in a dull effort.

GAMBLER'S FALLACY in the second flight while off the inside, closer far turn in some traffic, between foes late turn, moved out a bit to be three wide for the
drive, bid nearing the furlong marker, kicked clear late. I WILL STAND pressed early off the inside, assumed command just before a half, increased
advantage far turn, dueled past the furlong marker inside the winner, proved no match for that foe late, clearly second best. CANDY CARLOS broke on top
to show the way early, dueled with the runner up inside that one the middle half, continued to be in good position turning for home while continuing to save
ground, could no match the top two late, saved the show. BOBBY BABY off a step slow, raced in mid pack while in hand along the inside, continued save
ground into the far turn, angled three wide for the drive, slowly gaining for the show spot. NOT VERY GENTLE back off the pace and the inside, raced four
wide out of the second turn, made little impact through the lane. HARDLY A SECRET forwardly placed for six furlongs, faltered in the drive. MEISTERMIND
four wide in the first turn when off the pace, continued outside, closer briefly while remaining four wide in the second bend then gave way readily through the
stretch. UCANTHANKMELATER off a step slow, remained always back. HAMAZING VISION was finished early.

Footnotes
STRIKE POWER with the pace from along the inside, alternated up front through the turn, headed upper stretch, regained the advantage past the furlong
marker then spurted clear suddenly late under steady pressure in a sharp effort. HOLLIS away in good order, dueled up front outside the winner, came out a
bit to be three wide turning for home, continued on equal terms with the winner upper stretch, no match for that one in the late going, remained clear for the
place. TOUGH LOVE lacked early foot along the inside, continued to save ground, improved inside of a couple of rivals into the lane, finished up best of the
rest. SEVEN NATION ARMY last away, moved out, raced four wide and in mid pack through the turn, went evenly in the drive, caught late for the show.
NUCLEAR OPTION within striking distance for a half while in the two path, lacked a punch in the drive. THE SOUND forwardly placed early while in the
three path, retreated through the stretch. GRAY ATTEMPT remained always back in failing to menace.

Footnotes
INTO VICTORY forwardly placed from the start after breaking in good order, moved at will on the leader in the second turn, took over, well clear while being
kept to task. COMPETITIVE FIRE broke back, lacked early foot, moved strongly through traffic into contention through the second bend, proved no match
for the winner in the drive, remained clear for the drive. UNBURNT settled off the pace and the inside, four wide out of the final turn, staged a mild rally to be
slowly getting to the runner up late. KALLINIKI in mid pack while racing outside, moved closer in the three path far turn, improved a bit more into then lane
then was going evenly at the end. DIXIELAND CANDY broke alertly, chased early, in the second flight while racing in the middle half off the inside, three
wide into the lane, had little left for the drive. I'M EXCEE lacked speed outside, four out to five wide in the second turn, improved into the lane, lacked a
further response. KISS ON FIRE back off the pace inside, steered out to be three wide in the second turn, lacked a serious response. GET OFF MY TAIL off
a step slow, raced back, passed tiring rivals while never a factor. CHARMED ONE sprinted clear to set the pace, headed far turn and stopped. MY WICKED
WISH in mid pack while three wide, stopped far turn, jogged in. SHE'S MY RIDE finished after a half, gave way badly, distanced, also jogged across the
wire. SHESHAPPY within striking distance early, also stopped abruptly, jogged across as well, jogged in.
