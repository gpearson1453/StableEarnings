Footnotes
SUMMER STORM away in good order, raced in a forward pocket into the turn, asked for run and advanced to take over midway on the turn, shook clear
when straightened for home, not threatened to the drive while not feeling the crop to win ridden out. FANCIFIED back off the early pace off the inside, dove
to the inside and got through along the rail turning for home, could do little with the winner the final furlong, edged clear for the place. FRENCHIE FROU
FROU prompted the pace while outside, four wide through the turn, also proved no match for the winner in the drive, could not match the runner up late
either, just managed to hang on for the show. MS. MALEVOLENCE with the pace up the backstretch three wide and between horses, continued to force the
issue in the three path turn, weakened in the drive. SHE'S FIRE AND ICE last to leave, void of speed for a half, swung five wide into the stretch, displayed
some late interest to be gaining for the show spot. VISUAL MAGIC behind the pace toward the inside, waited briefly along the rail late in the turn, came up
empty when clear for the drive. DOMONETTE a pace factor in the two path, stopped midway on the turn.

Footnotes
ALLEN within striking distance while saving ground, continued inside when moving slightly closer through the second turn, slipped through along the rail to
challenge into the stretch, slight drift nearing the furlong grounds to help put a tiring CRITIC in tight, clear, enough left to last. MAJOR KONG outrun in the
early going, moved closer in some traffic late in the second turn, moved out a bit for room, set down, closed well to be getting to the winner late, narrowly
missed. FAST RECOVERY in the second flight outside, four out to five wide in the second turn, mild rally while not a match to the top two. GEORGIA
DEPUTY last away, raced back, remained back in the second turn, moved out four wide turning for home, improved position while too late. TOUGH
COMPANY chased the leader early, continued to press the middle half, three wide into the lane, drifted in a bit to help tighten up CRITIC, weakened through
the stretch. STASH THE CASH settled off the pace and the inside, moved a bit closer four wide late in the final turn, gave way in the drive. CRITIC cleared
toward the inside, set the pace, allowed the winner the inside entering the stretch, was tiring when in tight nearing the furlong marker, steadied then
continued to back up. HIGHLIGHT REEL broke back, raced three wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. LISTEN TO ROSE was finished after a half.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
SECRET MISTRESS broke alertly, narrowly set the early pace while dueling closest to the inside, put that foe away turning for home, was joined by a
second foe entering the stretch, dueled to the wire inside that rival, proved narrowly best in a determined effort. CALL DISH in the second flight off the
inside, ranged up three wide to challenge outside the winner turning for home, dueled to the wire, continued to race one equal terms past the furlong
marker, outkicked late. MILLARD'S COMET lacked early speed while along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, finished willingly late and
then continued to gallop out well. MISS MESS back off the pace toward the inside, steered out for the drive, closed the gap on the top two nearing the
furlong grounds, flattened out, caught late for the show. DIAL DISH last to leave, raced back, three wide into the lane, improved a bit upper stretch, not a
serious threat. CAGED BEAR broke back was never a threat while racing three wide. LEN'S GOLD dueled up front off the inside and outside the winner,
stopped exiting the turn. I'M BOSSY settled off the pace in mid pack while outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a response in the drive.

Footnotes
DERBY CODE lacked early foot, began to move after a half, solid gain while saving ground second turn, waited briefly for room late in that bend, squeezed
through along the rail turning into the stretch, took command, drove well clear under a right handed crop. SPIN RATE settled in the second flight off the rail,
moved closer with the winner outside that one late in the final turn, angled out three wide as that same foe was saving ground into the stretch, proved no
match, clear for the second spot. BIG BIZ washy, broke on top, set the pace toward but not on the rail, continued to show the way second turn, allowed the
winner the inside entering the stretch, offered but brief resistance to that one upper stretch, weakened, caught late for the place, narrowly lasted for the
show. SHAKE IT lacked early foot while saving some ground first turn, continued inside into the far turn, steered out to be widest for the drive upper stretch
when improving, narrowly missed for the show. FOXY ACE off a step slow, raced back, four out to five wide turning for home, improved upper stretch,
flattened final furlong. MRS. BEANS forwardly placed while racing three wide, tired. RIVER FINN four wide through the first turn when off the pace, failed to
muster a rally. CHITTO pressed the pace for a half and gave way. FIRST STRING was also finished after a half. RECKLESSNESS mid pack early off the
inside, began a steady fade after four furlongs as well, jogged in.

Footnotes
COROT broke alertly, dueled up front up the backstretch and into the turn in the two path, disposed of the other speed entering the stretch, held the runner
up at bay while finding more late in a game effort. GREELEY AND BEN in the second flight outside, ranged up closer four wide turning for home, challenged
outside the winner nearing the furlong marker, outkicked in the late going to settle for second best. COACH ADAMS settled off the pace and the inside, in
some traffic late in the turn, moved out a bit for room, brushed midstretch, finished up willingly annex the show. STREET TO INDY bobbled start, lacked
speed, continued back through the turn just off the inside. COWORKER off slowly, raced back, five wide when beginning to advance turning for home,
brushed with COACH ADAMS past the furlong marker, flattened out in the late going to finish up evenly. ALEXANDROS in the second flight along the
inside, moved a bit closer entering the stretch, flattened out in the final furlong. MAY WE ALL remained always back while saving ground. BASIC CHANCE
narrowly set the pace toward the inside, two path into the lane, stopped upper stretch.

Footnotes
BLAME J D broke alertly to be with the pace from the start, set the pace inside, edged clear when straightened for home, kept to task with a firm left handed
stick. TOPF ROAD RULES also broke well, pressed outside and three wide turn, could not keep up with the winner through the lane, clearly second best.
GOODNIGHT ARCHIE settled off the pace and the inside, came three wide out of the turn, no threat to the top two while holding sway for the show.
EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR bothered at the start, raced back, between foes in some traffic exiting the turn, improved position to be gaining for the show spot.
KAT'S HITMAN broke in, was straightened to race forwardly early, saved ground into the lane, came up empty for the stretch run. TWISTED DIXIE bothered
to be off slow, moved up into some traffic into the turn, steadied when lacking room, moved out, went one paced through the lane. DINNER AT CRUMPIES
broke back, made little impact while three wide. TRAFFIC CONTROL pressured the winner between that rival and the runner up, gave way in the drive.
INTO ORBIT fell back to trail after the start, not a factor while racing three wide. CINCO CATALINA in mid pack while racing four wide, backed up through
the stretch.

Footnotes
NOBLE REFLECTION broke sharp, soon got clear, showed the way through some quick early fractions, shook off the other speed in hand turning for home,
drew off under his own courage to win in handy fashion. GASLIGHT broke with the pace, back early toward the inside, worked way out to three wide by late
in the turn, rallied for the place, no match for the winner. ANTIGRAVITY chased the winner off the inside, had nothing for that one in the drive either, caught
late for the place. ENID went one paced throughout while in the two path. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS in mid pack well out in the strip, four wide through the turn,
also went evenly through the stretch. TWIRLING ROSES lacked speed, saved ground through the turn, improved slightly upper stretch then flattened out.
CAPTAIN FANTASTIC void of early foot, passed a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. SLEIGHT OF HAND forwardly placed early in the three path,
began a steady fade before a half while three wide. HAMMERSCHMIDT off a step slow, raced back, three wide through most of the turn, had little for the
drive.

Footnotes
DON'T FORGET within striking distance outside, three wide turn, closer late turn, roused, late bid outside the leader, wore down that rival under firm
handling. DRENA'S STAR broke sharp, cleared soon after, set the pace toward the inside, continued to hold a daylight advantage nearing midstretch, gave
ground grudgingly to the winner in the final strides, remained clear for the place. FLAT LUCKY allowed to settle off the pace just off the inside, staged a mild
rally to be along for the show, no threat to the top two. P R RADIO STAR closest to the leader for a half off the inside, had little left for the drive. RULER OF
THE NILE saved ground to no avail. STROLLING last to leave, trailed, lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
BEBOP SHOES steadied early in some tight quarter, moved up steadily into the turn, came four wide into the lane to lose some ground to the two leaders,
late bid, clear final strides. CAPTAIN DON broke well, pressed the leader from the outside into and through the turn, bid between rivals when straightened
for home, could not match strides with the winner late. MACHO ROCCO took command after the start inside, set the pace for over a half, headed by the
runner up a furlong out, weakened but managed to save the show. HEISFANCY off slowly, raced back, three wide into the lane, improved position while too
late for the show. CHICKEN HAWK went one paced behind the speed while racing in the two path. IZA DADDY in tight soon after the start, raced back,
came five wide into the stretch, was never dangerous. ASPEN CLUB also in tight quarters in the early going, moved out, four wide into the turn, lacked a
serious response when set down as well. DEMIGOD back off the pace, moved toward the inside through the turn, came up empty for the drive. WASABI
MOON void of early foot, five wide through the turn when moving to improve a bit, flattened out in the drive. HAMAZING SONG moved out, raced four wide
through most of the turn, tired in the drive. LANG'S FIR DOLL bothered while in mid pack early, began to fade before a half. PAY DIRT in tight just after the
break, finished before a half.
