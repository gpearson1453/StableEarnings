second at the wire. SUCKERFORAGREY dueled for the early advantage, saved ground and lacked a late kick. AFLEET MOON vied for the early lead,
dueling with SUCKERFORAGREY and weakened down the lane. TIZ ONE FEE void of early speed and was never close. RUN NOW ESTELLA raced
within contention in the early going and was finished early. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS always raced near the back, came around the second turn wide and

Footnotes
DOUBLE BARREL MAN challenged for the lead, raced outside around the turn, took the lead entering the stretch and pulled away down the lane. GALAXY
BUILDER unhurried in the early part, came around the turn wide, made a bid and was a clear second at the wire. SHANGROYAL showed early speed,
eased back, made a late try, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. TAPIZARS SECRET challenged on the front end in the beginning, took
the advantage around the turn and weakened down the stretch. ALTERANA lacked early speed and was never a factor. PRIZELESS dueled for the early
lead, saved ground and was finished early.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT REVOLT unhurried in the early part, moved up on outside around the final turn, pulled away and was in hand at the wire. SILENT FORCE
pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. BLUEWATER CAT broke out, racing near the back,
moved up, took command around the final turn and weakened down the stretch, proving third best. TALKOTHTOWN lacked early speed, showed late
interest, but was no factor. FAST DUDE pressed the early pace, being reserved, faded and was no threat late. OVERLYAPPEALING raced in the rear in the
beginning and passed tired ones late. SINGINGINTHEWIND raced within contention, faded and was outrun. NOMOREQUESTIONS always raced near the
back and showed little. PUNKY MONKEY hopped at the break, quickly went to the front, drove clear and stopped.
