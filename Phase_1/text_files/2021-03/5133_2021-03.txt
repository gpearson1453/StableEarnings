Footnotes
CABO SUNSET pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout, rallied down the final stretch, three wide and pulled away. AUNT JANA squeezed
back at the start, racing in the back, moved up wide around the final turn, rallied and got up for second. DYNAMIC JULIE was early factor, raced close
throughout, came around the final turn on the outside and got caught for second. EXECUTIVE COUNCIL dueled for the early lead, took command,
weakened and lacked a late kick. NATIVE TRIP raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. WE CAN DREAM broke in, raced near the back
and was never a threat. IDAREELDEAL broke out, void of early speed and was never close. MISSBUDLITELIME flashed early speed and dropped back.

EMMAS RULER pressed the pace, moved up on the outside around the final turn, dueled down the stretch and proved the best late. BACK INTHAT
ACTION went to the front, drove clear, dueled down the stretch with EMMAS RULER and proved second best. STAR FASHION raced in the middle of the
field, saved ground around the final turn and proved no match for the top two. KAITLYN'S COURT broke poorly, racing in the rear, had an outside trip,
showed late interest, but was no factor. KAPPA HILL raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. MISS MIRACLE GIRL pressed the early pace and
was finished early. C. F. SHELAUH lacked early speed, moved up within striking distance and faded. VELVET NIGHT raced within striking distance, came
around the final turn wide and dropped back.

Footnotes
IOWA NATIVE dueled for the early lead, saved ground, drove clear late and won under steady urging. JACK BE QUICK raced near the middle of the field,
drifted out around the first turn, came around the second turn four wide, rallied down the lane and got up for second. BAJAN CASH hesitated at the start,
racing in the rear, came around the second turn on the outside, entered the stretch six wide, finished willingly and missed place. BAYOU BODE hopped at
the start, pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and weakened down the home stretch. ARCHIE lacked early speed and was never close.
NATEALYZE hopped at the start, raced near the back and was never a factor. CAJUN CASH challenged for the early lead and was finished early.

made a mild bid, but was no factor. SILVER MAID raced within striking distance, saved ground around the final turn and weakened. NALIYA MARIE raced
in the middle of the field, faded and was no threat late. LIL BEAU PETE pressed the early pace and made a steady retreat. JESSCATCHME always raced

A. K. A. GRAMS was an early factor, took the lead, drove clear down the stretch and won under steady urging. MISS MANASSAS raced in the back in the
early part, moved up on the inside around the second turn, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but got by SLIDE for second. SLIDE challenged
for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, lacked a finish and couldn't match strides with the top two. TRUE BROWN SLEW broke well, pressed the
pace, eased back and passed tired ones late. TEN TAP DANCES void of early speed and was never close. LUCKY PRIORITY raced in the middle of the
field, dropped back and was outrun.

the early lead, drove clear and was outfinished by the top two. MAINTAINANCE MATT raced in the middle of the pack, made a bid and hung. MR

ground, couldn't match strides late with the winner, but was best of others. DOCTOR LEO pressed the early pace, followed the top two to the wire and held
on for show. MARVINS GOLD raced within striking distance, made a mild bid and missed third. OUT MAKING TREBLE void of early speed, improved
position, but was no factor. COLOR FAST lacked early speed, moved up and finished evenly. HEAROSEONEASTER always raced near the back and
showed little. CRAFTY FLOWER raced near the back, had an outside trip and was outrun. FREE ONE raced within contention and dropped back.
