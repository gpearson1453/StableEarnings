HIGH POWERED unhurried early, rallied past the half, cleared away smartly in the late stages. EASY DOER chased leader to stretch while no match for
winner late holding the place spot. PERFECT COMIC raced evenly, moved up from the turn to just miss place spot. TWINKLING KNIGHT broke alertly,
settled in while evenly throughout with no late gain. FRED'S COUNTRY BOY had a sluggish start and never threatened. HONEY DONT gained early lead,
cleared off quickly on the backstretch, dueled far turn and gave way readily.

raced far back to quarter pole, reached contention, moved up late. MISS ESSIE inside run to far turn, failed to sustain the bid. ANTECEDENCE awkward
start, no speed while always back no menace. TRADITIONAL ARCHER tracked from off rail to quarter pole, no late kick, faded. NOT A NEEDY GAL quick
speed to the front, stayed well to deep stretch and gave way readily.
