TRENDING UP was content to lag along the inside into the stretch, angled out, split horses to vie into midstretch and wore down the leader late.
TUCKERTON BAY dueled two wide then gave way late. MIDDLE EARTH came out three wide between horses while moving closer on the turn then lacked
a further response. P JS SILVER DUKE was slow early, angled out on the turn, raced six wide into the stretch and lacked a strong closing. MIDTOWN
dueled inside the winner into midstretch then weakened. COLBALOAF came out four wide between horses on the turn with a mild run then flattened out in
the lane. GET DOWN BROWN stumbled badly leaving the gate, came out five wide on the turn with a mild run then was eased up through the lane.

enough after a long drive. PEPE TONO settled in the three path and gained slowly outside. DUE GEMELLI chased in hand, stayed inside around the final
turn and continued evenly. TOP HAT TREASON raced the two path and lacked a rally. OWIN was no factor. SUPERHIGHWAY bobbled while slow leaving
