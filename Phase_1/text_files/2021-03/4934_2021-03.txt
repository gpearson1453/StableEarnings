show spot. BLUEGRASS BELLE inside chase throughout, mild bid in the stretch with nothing left late. SEAWARD inside trip while evenly with no response
when needed. CHOCTAW BINGO outside chase to far turn but gave way readily. LISA'S LEGACY stumbled after the start and lost best chance while never
close.

MR. BANYAN inside run with a steady gain into stretch but just outfinished in the late going. PERFECT PAINTING three wide chase to turn, short lead late
but outkicked to wire. POLLARD'S DAY bore in bumped rival start, set pace to deep stretch, headed at furlong pole and weakened. DERBY MODEL trailed
to the half, hustled along to far turn with little response. COWBOY HIPPIE tracked between horses to quarter pole but gave way readily. STONEMEISTER
was through at the half and stopped.
