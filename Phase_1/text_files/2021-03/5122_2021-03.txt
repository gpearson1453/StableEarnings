Footnotes
HOT SOCKS stalked the early pace from a three wide running position, dueled with DARKSABER through the stretch, drifted in on that rival at the eighth
pole, was kept to task and prevailed. DARKSABER assumed command of the early fractions from a two wide running position, met the challenge of HOT
SOCKS while between horses in the drive,was bumped at the eighth pole by HOT SOCKS,while also impeding PAPER BOY at that point, and made a
steady run to the finish. DREAMER'S REALITY settled just off of the early pace, four wide on the turn, made a late rally while widest of the field in the
stretch to get third. PAPER BOY settled toward the rear of the field early, saved ground on the turn, pushed up to be close to the leaders in the stretch,
checked at the eighth pole while impeded by DARKSABER and had no late rally. FINAL ROSE was unhurried early, maintained at three wide running
position on the turn, and had no late response in the stretch. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident involving #1 DARKSABER and #2 HOT
SOCKS, and in a unanimous decision, disqualified #2 HOT SOCKS from first to fourth. A jockey objection was lodged by the rider of #1 DARKSABER
against the rider of #2 HOT SOCKS.

KNOWN settled off of the contested early pace, traveled three wide into the second turn while still chasing the pace, stayed three wide into the stretch,
mounted a late rally and wore down SILVER FURY late for the win. SILVER FURY was hustled early, set fractions while saving ground through the
backstretch and second turn, was confronted by KNOWN at the sixteenth pole and was not able to fend that one off, while still second best. HYPERSONIC
bobbled slightly at the start,pressed the pace from a two wide running position on the backstretch and second turn, began to tire coming into the stretch and
could not mount a late bid. CURRY NATION was unhurried early, settled at the rear of the field while saving ground, began passing tiring rivals in the stretch
and closed quickly. CLASSY CHASIE settled toward the back of the field, saved ground through the backstretch and second turn, was asked for run in the
stretch but tired late. ALLEYCAT settled in the middle of the field early, saved ground two wide into the second turn while losing position, and weakened in

held on. CLAIM OF PASSION was settled to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then shifted out in mid stretch and closed in a rally. READY

turn and was gaining ground belatedly. RIVER ROSE stalked the pace to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch, dueled to deep stretch then was
outkicked late. DESCARTES pressed the pace two wide for a half mile, raced two wide to the stretch but weakened in the drive. RESPECT THE HUSTLE
had no speed, settled to the second turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch but tired in the drive. RED'S SHOWTIME set the pace to the second turn
