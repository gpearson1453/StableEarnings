Footnotes
MY DEAR LOLITA sprinted clear inside, nursed along under good handling throughout and held sway to the wire. SWAY MY WAY sat in good position while
never far back, rallied to be coming on too late at the wire. THEA BEE chased leaders throughout but outpaced in the stretch run. SO LONG DIXIE outside
trip to the stretch and leveled off in the final furlong. JAMIN'S JET failed to seriously threaten. RUBY ROUND HERE shuffled back to the turn with nothing
left for the stretch run. CANDYCREAM was through early from inside and dropped back. WATERLOO SUNSET seemed to have an equipment malfunction
early and steadily dropped out.

Footnotes
DYNAPOWER trailed to the half, rallied widest, under stout handling and finished with a flurry to go clear late. LUCKY LIZZIE quick inside, set pace to deep
stretch but proved no match and all out to hold the place spot .RONAN unhurried to far turn, rushed up the inside the the quarter pole while just missing
place on the wire. CROSSED THE LINE tracked outside to stretch mild bid in the drive while mildly in the late going. MINNIEMOREPROMISES raced
evenly, lacking the late punch in the final furlong. DEFENDER OF FAITH chased inside to the turn with nothing left and dropped far back. AMARIN raced
evenly to the stretch while also used up and dropped back late. MOLLYS MELODIE dropped far back after the half. DIMPLES OF VENUS with pace to
quarter pole but came up empty and stopped readily. BOO HAWK had a sluggish beginning and never a factor.
