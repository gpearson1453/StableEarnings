Footnotes
LA KARA MIA away without apparent mishap, remained stationed in the three path, was asked to pick it up getting switched over to a brisk hand ride at the
five-sixteenths pole, stepped onto the head of the stretch displaying good momentum, maintained it, forging to a narrow lead by the conclusion of the run
through the furlong grounds, contended with a pesky MOON SWEEPER until shaking free in the final seventy yards. VOICE OF SPRING firmly rated
tracking the front runners from the pocket during the opening phases, was let out a notch crossing the midway point on the turn, angled four wide for the
stretch run, straightened away and had a good finish down the center of the strip to garner the place. MOON SWEEPER rushed up along the rail on the
chute to establish the top, was kept to some coaxing after achieving the goal, edged away from the others during the run around the bend, resulting in some
of the competition to come under stronger handling themselves, got turned loose after settling in at the top of the lane, relinquished with a furlong to go,
battled onward before weakening in the last seventy yards. LUCKY GIRL prompted the pace from the two path, was put to a drive after becoming unhitched
with the leader in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, spun into the lane and backed away. SHE'SFIRSTCLASS made it into the two path prior to
leaving the backstretch, was already being urged along by the five-sixteenths pole, went into the lane and retreated.

Footnotes
JARA was rated along showing the way in the two path on the backstretch, cut over to the inside route after stepping onto the turn, continued to show the
way being held in reserve by the pilot, settled in upper stretch and was given her cue, responded to kick well clear. LOVE ME TOMORROW stalked the
winner from the outside, going about the task two wide on the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wider, proved no match. MISTY TASTE sat forwardly
placed in the two path, swung out towards path four for the drive, went on to secure the show. FIRST DAWN sighted taking the inside route on the turn,
tipped out two wide for the stretch run, made no headway. TRAPPED N MY MIND got set up in the two path, went about the turn under a hand ride, was
steered out four wide into the lane, launched no bids. HOLMDEL PARK raced three wide on the turn, was moved out six wide from upper to midlane,
backed away. SYZYGY darted over to the rail approaching the half mile pole, cut the corner into the and retreated.

LATIN CASINO four paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader early on, advanced to take over half a mile from home and tucked to the two path into
the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. TAKE A CHANCE
hustled from the gate, showed the way from the two path until headed near the half mile pole, tucked inside and chased through the turn coaxed along from
the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. SECRET POTION stumbled at the start
recovering outwards into IRON GIANT, chased three then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved
position to procure the show honors on the wire. KING JAMES five paths off the inside down the backstretch in aim of the front, tucked three wide through
the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. FROSTED INDIAN coaxed from the
start, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from midway, spun three wide for home and
weakened. IRON GIANT bumped at the start by SECRET POTION, who recovered outwards from a stumble, chased just off the inside growing detached at
the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went two to three wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ELOQUENT SPEAKER got guided into the two path after the field had been sent on its way, flashed some interest when let out a notch at the three-eighths
pole, got steered into path four for the stretch run, chopped away at the deficit in a steadfast manner, struck the front with just over a sixteenth to go and
edged clear. MY ROXY GIRL put into path three, vied as the widest of a threesome for the majority of the opening half, got set down challenging in earnest
as those front runners headed for the top of the lane, grabbed a narrow advantage only to have the winner bearing down hard shortly afterwards,
relinquished in the general area of the sixteenth pole, stayed on for second. IMPAZIBLE DONNA off a half beat fast, raced from along the outside, angled
sharply into the two path coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, kept pace with the ones to catch, shifted out three wide late on the bend in
preparation for a bid, flattened out. FIGHT ON LUCY the tardiest out of the gate, brought up the rear on the backstretch, slid onto the rail at the half mile
pole, swung out three wide into the lane, narrowed in en route for the last major check. BABY BOSS in path two, pressed the issue from between rivals for a
half and gave way. QUALITY STONES lightly urged, emerged from a tight pack with the advantage, got sent over to the inside, showed the way, feeling
some pressure from a pair of foes parked out two and three wide themselves, got set down prior to the quarter pole, yielded to heavy pressure soon
afterwards and backed away.

Footnotes
DANCING KIKI was reserved tracking the front runners at near the inside route for the opening three-quarters, got driven getting taken to the outside
coming up to the quarter pole, wound up in the neighborhood of path six when finally straightened away, went after the one to catch in earnest, drew abreast
by the beginning of the last eighth, had the two of them dueling in tight quarters with each other from the sixteenth pole, gamely got the head down in time to
win the bob. I'M FINE unhurried towards path two for the initial half, motored up to the front runners with a sustained four wide run springing from the
three-eighths pole, tipped one path when set down heading onto the top of the lane, began the last eighth engaged in a tussle with DANCING KIKI, went at
it on nearly even terms for the last sixteenth, had the verdict snatched away at the finish line. FOLEY SQUARE at the back of the pack early, got spotted
into the two path by the top of the turn, finished off the run around the bend, got sent out into the seven path from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of
all, rallied mildly for the show. HONEY MONEY disputed the pace from the two path, assumed control after crossing the midway point on the turn, was put
to a drive being put to the test, succumbed, then backed away in the final furlong. VIENNA CODE off the inside, argued as the widest of three from path
three early on the turn, then went at it one with HONEY MONEY afterwards, got driven into the lane, gave out. ALPHADORA guided over to the rail after
departing the chute, contended for the top until the general area of the three-eighths pole before faltering.

Footnotes
ABSOLUTE PRIVILEGE chased along the inside until tipped to the two path into the turn, got placed to coaxing near the three-eighths, swung three wide for
home, rallied through the final furlong to issue a challenge taking command inside the final sixteenth, then inched away to the finish kept busy to the end.
MADAME ROSE coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside in close aim of the leader, advanced through the turn taking over command placed to
coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat, got caught
inside the sixteenth marker and ran on well clear of the rest to be along second best. ROMA CARPE five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, went five wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. TINY MAGOO chased along the rail down the backstretch and into the turn, got
tipped to the two path put to coaxing just outside the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. FLIRTACIOUS KISS three then two
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. TOURIST ATTRACTION coaxed from the
start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along midway on the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch
and made no impact. BLEY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under the watchful presence of MADAME ROSE to her outside,
came under coaxing when that rival headed her for command near the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and faltered. DEVIL ON THE
LOOSE chased four then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went six to seven wide at the head of the stretch and tired.
