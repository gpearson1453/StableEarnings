Footnotes
MONSOON RAIN was allowed to lope along on soft splits through the far turn showing to have plenty left when threatened down the lane holding firm to
wire. KITTY EXPRESS hopped at the break taking a forward position tracking a slow pace vying from the inside in upper stretch angling out late being held
at bay by the winner. CASPIAN TALE stalked the pace cutting the corner to upper stretch weakening near the rail. HIDATSA PARK surged outside to
threaten on the far turn then flattened out in upper stretch. SWEETALKINGJUSTICE stalked a slow pace to the far turn then folded into upper stretch.
VELVET SAMI gave way after a half mile.

TRINNI DANCER rated on lead dispatched rival into upper stretch kicking clear as much the best. RESTITUTION stalked close up pressing on the far turn,
dispatched by the winner in upper stretch was tiring along the inside mustering enough to save place. FINALLY tracked evenly chasing on the far turn, no
match down the lane dueled for place in a weakened state. REDS BEST slow early played no factor. AMR tracked early tiring on the far turn giving way into
upper stretch. L. L. B. STORM offered little.
