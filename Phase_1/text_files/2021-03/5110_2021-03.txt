Footnotes
LAISSEZ FAIRE sent hard hustled on a clear lead through the backside coming under pressure on the far turn, angled out at the head of lane finding more
under stiff urging somehow reaching the wire in time. STARR DESIGNER went evenly through the far turn firing along the inside in upper stretch surging at
the pacesetter late being denied. MISS HEART lagging well back through the far turn circled out to mid track in upper stretch responding to threaten in the
final yards. CASPIAN TALE slow early saved ground to upper stretch gaining belatedly along the rail. SURFER GIRL CENTS stalked the pace gaining to
loom outside the quarter pole, extending in the three path from the eighth pole would flatten out. SHINY SURPRISE hustled along in mid pack would fold to
upper stretch.

Footnotes
SARAH JANE tracked the pace emerging off a clear leader on the far turn, set down outside the pacesetter in upper stretch would need full extension to
draw even then edge up at the wire. LUCKY DOUBLE D'S set a pressured pace through the backside shaking clear on the far turn, digging in from the two
path down the stretch was hooked nearing the sixteenth pole battling back to no avail. DENIRO'SRUNFORFUN a step slow to the far turn gave a mild rally
into upper stretch proving no match for the top pair while clearly best of the others. QUEEN AIR raced evenly throughout never reaching contention.
COWGIRL CHROME played no factor. A FABULOUS KISS was never involved. NICEASAKITTENSEYES showed little. QUEEN OF THE TILES pressured
through the backside then wilted on the far turn.

Footnotes
PINK PAJAMAS tracked through the turn looming into upper stretch rallying up late four wide. BLACK BUTTE a step slow through the turn raced inside to
upper stretch angling out in mid stretch surging gamely late. COMPANYS COMING pressed the pace dueling to lead along the inside in upper stretch
wakening a bit when ceding late. BROOK'S ON FIRE slow early raced five wide into upper stretch finishing evenly at mid track. BLUSHING BELLA slow
early played no factor. RUN MICKEY RUN pressed a narrow lead through the turn dueling into upper stretch wearing out late. HOBOKEN HUSTLE faded
on the turn. MISS IRISH BOSS was always outrun. NICE RIDE was eased in upper stretch walking across the wire vanning off after the race.
