Footnotes
SMITTYS PATRIARCH broke very fast, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, extended the advantage into upper stretch, responded well when
asked at the three-sixteenths and drew off under a moderate hand ride to win ridden out. SEMI CHARMED LIFE bumped hard with a rival just after the start
then was taken up, raced at the rear on the outside, went four wide on the turn, lugged in just after turning into the stretch, drifted out behind another foe
that was drifting out into the final furlong and just got up for the place. MINISTER'S MEDAL was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside, went
four then three wide on the turn, drifted inward near the furlong marker and lost the place at the wire while just able to get the show. HAVE A NOTION was
urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and just missed the trifecta. I'M ALWAYS LATE was urged
along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, lugged in near the three-sixteenths, drifted out into the final furlong and failed to threaten. CHINESE
BANDIT was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. HE'S TAYLOR MADE bumped with a rival at the start, raced well
back in the field, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. ABACUS ON TAP bumped hard with a rival just after the start then was taken up, went around
the turn in the two path and also was no factor.

Footnotes
LOVE OF MY HEART was taken up at the start, established a good position just off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path while in dead aim of the top
three, shifted three wide into the stretch then steadied behind horses, altered to the rail at the three-sixteenths, rallied to the lead nearing the furlong marker
then drew clear under a hand ride to prove much the best. BLUEBIRD SING broke a step slow, chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the
turn, took the lead in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner approaching the furlong marker and proved no match while well clear for the place.
MISS UNDERRATED pressed the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader in the three path on the turn, took the advantage before the
five-sixteenths, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and tired but held the show. VEILAZIG was away very awkwardly and off slow, spotted the front a
few lengths, raced well back on the outside while ridden along, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. SAY YES AGAIN set the pace under
pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead before the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and faded. EASTER GIRL
broke out a bit at the start, was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, drifted out near the furlong marker and showed little.

CITY MISCHIEF stumbled awkwardly at the start then bumped with a foe, was bumped on both sides early then steadied, settled off the pace, went three
then four wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch then was carried further out, rallied down the center of the course and closed strongly to win going
away. PRAIRIE was rated on the outside, went three wide while let out on the turn, shifted five wide into the stretch then was carried further out, chased into
the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the place. BENBOW CAT sped clear early and set the pace, was challenged while in the two path on the turn,
bumped with a foe while set down inside the quarter-pole, shook clear into the final furlong but was overtaken while able to get the show. READY TO
POUNCE bumped with a rival while off slow, moved out at the rear, dropped in to save ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, moved out into
the final furlong, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and improved position. ROCKDALE tugged hard at the bit while rated just behind the leader, moved out
late on the backstretch then bumped with a foe, leveled out in the two path on the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch then drifted further out and
weakened. MAJESTIC SUMMER bumped solidly with a rival early then was taken up near the nine-sixteenths, went four then five wide on the turn, was
forced seven wide into the stretch, drifted in at the three-sixteenths, drifted further in and bothered a foe into the final sixteenth and lacked the needed
response. NO OBLIGATION was hustled from the start, tracked the pace on the outside, bumped with an opponent late on the backstretch, made a bid in
the three path on the turn, bumped with the leader outside the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. REMEMBER HYMN acted-up
at the start and was off very slow, spotted the front many lengths, went three to four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor.
PLUTONIUM bumped solidly with a rival early, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the final

Footnotes
TOO MUCH BOURBON settled under some urging, drafted two then three wide on the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside,
closed well to get the lead into the final furlong then drew clear under strong urging. GEM OF CARLOS was asked to establish early position then taken in
hand behind a foe at the five-eighths, was rated just behind the pacesetter, drafted inside to the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch behind horses,
was asked at the three-sixteenths, chased while still on his inside lead and earned the place while no match for the winner. WESTERN STAR broke a step
slow, was urged along off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response while along for the show. FIRST METAL COUNT
moved in while going to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, was headed at the three-sixteenths and gave way. PILLAGE DA
VILLAGE tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, took the lead in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner while still
on his inside lead into the final furlong and tired. SILENT CRY broke a step slow, was urged along near the back on the outside, went four wide on the turn,
came six wide into the stretch, drifted out just inside the three-sixteenths and was no factor. WHATAFIND settled at the rear of the field, saved ground on
the turn and showed little. ACT OF DONATION was coaxed along on the outside, went four wide under urging on the turn, came five wide into the stretch
and faltered.

two path, was unhurried at the rear, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch and finished with late energy to garner
the place. MARYWOOD bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front, set an uncontested pace in the two path through tepid fractions, was asked
outside the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner outside the furlong marker and was outfinished. LEBKUCHEN was rated on the inside, shifted
three wide into upper stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked. SHE'S GONE D'WILD went three wide on the first turn, settled
towards the rear, saved ground while roused on the far turn, came out into the stretch then dropped back in again, raced in the two path in the final furlong
and gained some but failed to threaten. ROOM TO FINISH settled on the inside, was asked some on the far turn then roused for more in upper stretch,
chased to the sixteenth-pole, steadied while lacking room in the final sixteenth and lost her chance at the minor awards. SAINTS N MUSKETS was taken in

stretch, gained into the final sixteenth and earned the show. LAFITTE'S FLEET had a shoe repaired in the paddock, settled at the rear of the field, went
three wide on the turn, dropped to the two path under the crop into the stretch and improved position. FLYING CURLIN was hard held towards the rear,

threaten. MISTER K was urged along towards the back, went four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten while gaining in

quarter-pole, drew off under a drive into the final furlong and maintained a safe advantage under steady urging. SARANYA went two to three wide on the

lacked the needed response. BARISTA went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked three wide on the far turn, chased into
upper stretch and tired. DRAMATIZER broke a step slow, went three then four wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, raced inside early on the far turn,
shifted two then three wide later on that bend, swung eight wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. SPUN D'ETAT raced in the three path on the first
turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, dropped back three wide into the stretch and capitulated. SIMPLY
