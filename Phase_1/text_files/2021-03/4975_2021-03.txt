Footnotes
GAMBIT set a pressured pace inside, repelled challenges then edged away through the stretch while kept to his task. GRAND OASIS stalked the leaders
three wide, continued wide and finished willingly. SURFER BOY GEORGE dropped back early, trailed for long way then gained inside through the stretch.
EARTHQUAKE lacked speed, moved between rivals then flattened out late. QUALITY SPECIAL prompted the winner to the stretch and faltered. KING'S
GOLD saved ground off the pace and proved empty in the stretch.

LT. COLUMBO stalked two wide early, settled off the dueling leaders, advanced on the far turn, rallied two wide into the stretch, gained command and
edged away in the final sixteenth, driving. REBEL TRAVELLER raced off the pace inside, dropped back, moved up midway on the far turn, rallied late near
the inside and got up for second at the wire. GRANDFIRE dueled inside for the lead, opened up a long lead in tandem with STAR LUCK on the backside, re
bid outside of that rival on the far turn, was floated wide at the quarter pole, dug in gamely outside in the stretch drive and just missed for second. STAR
LUCK dueled two wide for the lead, briefly shook free entering the far turn, drifted out at the quarter pole and tired. INSPIRED OPTIONS raced off the pace,
off the inside, chased on the far turn, angled out entering the stretch and lacked a bid. FOX IN THE FOG raced off the pace inside, rallied on the rail
entering the stretch, then weakened. DON'T RECALL raced three wide off the pace, went four wide past the quarter pole and did not factor.

TOWN JAK raced off the pace between rivals, chased two wide on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch drive, moved up alongside KING'S HOUSE and
wore down that rival to prevail. KING'S HOUSE dueled for the early lead, shook free on the turn, dug in gamely when challenged and yielded grudgingly
near the finish. CATCH FIRE dueled between rivals early, chased inside on the turn, dug in through the lane and just held on for third. MANOLETE dueled
for the early lead, chased on the turn, raced evenly in the stretch and just missed for third. STREET TAIL raced close up early, chased three wide on the
turn, made a bid and was outkicked. TOMATER GATOR raced off the pace, advanced three wide on the turn and lacked a rally. NICK THE CARDSHARK
chased on the rail, was in tight and checked entering the turn, then dropped back.

ADMIRAL ABE broke a step slowly, rushed clear inside, kept a good advantage then lasted while tiring late. ARCH CAT angled outside rallying on the turn
and finished gamely just failing to get up in time. THISCATCANJUMP steadied in traffic on the turn, angled in then went evenly late. GOLD RUSH DANCER
saved ground off the pace, made a brief bid on the turn then faded. INFORMATIVE dropped back wide and lacked a rally. MIDNIGHTCHARLY chased
outside and weakened steadily after half a mile. NO LONGER SILENT raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and stopped on the turn. A claim of foul by
the third finisher against the second finisher for interference on the turn was dismissed.
