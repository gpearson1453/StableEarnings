BOW TOWN CAT held a measured lead early then widened through the stretch under a drive. GRACE AND PEACE broke sluggishly, raced far back then
split rivals in the stretch with some late energy. MRS. CREWS urged close up outside, moved very wide in the stretch and continued willingly. AMERS raced
close up between rivals then proved empty in the stretch. BAAQEYA lacked speed, moved closer on the turn then faltered. ROCHELA prompted the pace in
the two path and faded after half a mile. SKOOKIE dropped back outside and was never in contention. TO THE FLAG was hustled close up inside to the
quarter pole and gave way. CIAO LUNA raced five wide down the backstretch and stopped.

start, dueled three wide for command, gained a short lead, dueled in the stretch drive and weakened. CALL ME G Q stumbled badly at the start, raced off
the pace inside and had no rally. U S CONSTITUTION was bumped and forced to check at the start, then chased outside, raced four wide on the turn and
tired. JUNGLIST dueled between rivals, dueled on the turn and faded. GETDOWNCHARLYBROWN did not factor. BIZZY GILLESPIE raced off the rail, off
the pace and did not factor. ORACABESSA dropped back on the turn and was outrun. After a Jockey's Objection, E T'S DEUCES WILD was disqualified

quickly took command, remained clear to mid stretch but was outfinished from her inside. NEW JERSEY pursued the loose pacesetter outside and
continued well to the finish. TWIRLING LIZ dropped back in the opening quarter, moved between foes but had no rally. LULA'S ROADRUNNER dropped far
behind then passed a stopping rival. LUCKY TRINITY raced close up three wide then began retreating on the turn.
