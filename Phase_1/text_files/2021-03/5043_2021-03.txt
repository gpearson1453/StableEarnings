Footnotes
FLYING BUSINESS broke in mid pack and a bit to the outside, prompted the early pace on the outside, three wide into the turn, crept closer midway on the
bend, floated out four wide turning for home, dueled to the wire with that rival and proved best while fully extended. ABRAMAX broke alertly, pressured the
early leader off the inside, bid between foes turn, floated foe out into the lane, dueled to the wire, proved stubborn to the end, clear of the others. SUMMER
LOVIN back off the pace and the inside, in the two path into the stretch, staged a mild rally to gain the show, no real threat to the winner. VISUAL MAGIC
moved up inside after the start to set the pace, vied through the turn closest to the inside, weakened in the drive. NAPILI last to leave, trailed early, saved
ground turn, came up empty for the drive in finishing up evenly. LA PAQUITA forwardly placed in the early going while three wide, faded.

Footnotes
JAMES'S MOONSHINE with the pace from the start, dueled up front off the inside, shook off the other speed turning for home, well clear past the furlong
marker, held the runner up comfortably safe late under token pressure to win ridden out. ARLINGTON'S SHINE void of speed while moving out four wide
onto the backstretch, continued outside, three out to four wide second turn, rallied willingly to be in time for the place, steadily getting to the winner while too
late. RANDOM AFFAIR dueled up front inside the winner, fell back off that one midway on the final turn, moved out for the drive, caught late for the place.
SHINE JACK'S DREAM broke through the gate prior to the start, reloaded in good order, broke with the field then turned in an even effort off the inside.
GHOST STRATEGY bothered to be off slow, fell further back when sluggish early, continued to lag up the backstretch, improved position by passing tiring
rivals, never a serious threat. CYBER FLAME saved ground to no avail in remaining always back. WILL RED forwardly placed out in the strip for a half,
retreated. LIME TREE VALLEY broke out to bother GHOST STRATEGY, failed to menace. TUFFY rank through the first turn, was finished early.

Footnotes
PICK UP THE FONE with the pace along the inside, shook clear turning for home, roused, enough left late while being kept to pressure. AWESOME INDRA
behind the first flight early along the inside, shifted out to be three wide midway on the turn, set down for the drive on the outside, briefly dueled outside
BLINKERS past the furlong marker, disposed of that one and was rapidly getting to the winner late. BLINKERS vied up front three side early, dueled with
the winner late in the turn, proved no match for that one in the drive, could not match the runner up the final furlong inside that one, saved the show. SHE'S
FIRE AND ICE went one paced throughout while racing outside. FLATOYA flashed brief speed while between foes for three furlongs, began to weaken by
midway on the turn, continued to fade stretch. BEAUTY DAY in the second flight early, fell back, two path into the lane, was pinched and forced to alter
course nearing the furlong marker, modest late interest when clear. LA ROSA DRIVE back off the pace inside, continued to save ground turn, failed to
muster a rally in the drive.

Footnotes
LONGNTALL unhurried early, moved out to be three wide for the run up the backstretch, closer far turn, took over turning for home, drew clear, ridden out.
DEE LIKES THIS ONE broke in a bit, was straightened to quickly moved up the inside and show the way into the first turn, well clear by a quarter, continued
hold a sizable advantage backstretch, offered little resistance to the winner entering the stretch, held sway for the place late. ELLA'S MY GIRL last away,
raced back in lacking any form of early foot, improved while saving ground through the second turn, continued in willing fashion to the end to be up for the
show. FEMININE ALLURE settled off the pace toward the inside, moved closer after dropping to the rail far turn, briefly boxed midway on that bend, moved
off the rail late in the turn, closest to the top two past the furlong marker, caught late for the show. SPOT'S MAINE GIRL lacked early foot while four wide
into the first turn, raced three wide through the second turn, improved position into the stretch then flattened out late to be oukicked for the show spot.
BACKGATE BELLE void of speed for six furlongs, came on the outside for the drive, improved position with some modest late interest then too finished up
one paced. MARQUEE COWBOY in the second flight early in the three path, fell back the middle half then had little for the drive. THURSDAY MORNING
chased the runner up early, continued to pursue that one up the backstretch, gave way when the real running began turning for home. CYBER SNEAKER
underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, settled in mid pack, lacked a response. DANZIG STAR was finished early, fell far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
JACK VAN BERG vied up front early on the outside up the backstretch, dueled through the latter part of the turn, edged clear when straightened for home,
maintained a daylight advantage the final furlong under steady handling. CHANGE DIRECTION also with the pace from the start, between rivals into the
turn, dueled inside the winner into the stretch, lost contact with that one upper stretch, could not get back to that same rival late, clearly second best. ITS MY
BAG BABY lacked early foot for a half inside, angled out to be three wide into the lane, late interest to be edging clear for the show. KICKIN' KIRBY vied up
front along the inside early, fell back off the top two late in the bend, chased the top two past the furlong marker, caught late for the show. LIMBO'S
PROMISE went one paced while racing four wide through the turn. ROGALLO remained back throughout in failing to menace. SCREEN STAR in the
second flight while racing off the inside, had little for the drive. PERFECT MISTAKE last away, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LONELY PRIVATE broke well, set or forced the pace along the inside, headed, battled back after a long drive to prevail in game fashion. SHIP IT RED also
raced with the pace from the start, narrowly showed the way into the turn, headed, long drive, outfinished in the late going while prevailing for the place.
DEFLATER within striking distance while along the inside, bit closer, steadied along the rail nearing the half mile marker, continued inside and covered up
through the turn, traffic while remaining along the rail the final furlong, narrowly gained the show. EARNER prompted the leaders on the outside early, three
wide through the turn, remained within striking distance on the outside through the stretch, lacked a late punch, missed the show. SUBSTANTIAL within
striking distance, shuffled back slightly in some traffic midway up the backstretch, continued off the pace while racing three wide, lacked a closing response.
SACRED OATH last away, angled out four wide turning for home, came up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
CAVE RUN close from the start off the inside, pressed the issue from the two path into the turn, took over entering the stretch, clear, maintained daylight
under steady handling. CODETOWIN behind the pace inside, continued to save ground through the turn, got through past the furlong marker, could do little
with the winner the final sixteenth, remained clear for the place. STORMIN HONGKONG in mid pack while racing just off the inside, remained in the two into
and through the stretch, split foes with less than a furlong remaining, narrowly gained the nod for the show. COWORKER forwardly placed out in the strip,
three wide through the turn, set down for the drive, came up empty for the drive. ORO DE TEJANO lacked early foot, angled out a bit turning for home,
improved position slightly while not a serious threat. STROLLING off a step slow, moved out to be four wide backstretch, moved a bit closer while remaining
in the four path turn, faltered in the drive. SOMETHING SUPER void of early foot, remained back in failing to menace. ACE DESTROYER broke sharp,
cleared toward the inside, gave way when headed entering the stretch.

Footnotes
DARREN'S FORTUNE moved up to be well clear before a quarter in the two path, all the pace while remaining two wide, turned back foe midway second
turn, cruised home to win ridden out. KENTUCKY SUMMER off a step slow, raced unhurried toward the rail and under firm restraint early, continued
unhurried past the wire the first time, rallied from the two path through the final turn and finished willingly to earn the place, not a serious threat to the winner.
KNIGHT'S CROSS forwardly place well out in the strip, stalked the winner from the three path, tried that rival from the outside in the final turn, hung in the
drive. AMANI'S EAGLE broke alertly, relinquished advantage into the first turn, chased the winner while saving ground, moved slightly closer exiting the final
bend then began to weaken. STOCK DEAL settled in mid pack off the inside, three wide through the final turn, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing
punch. CHANGI went one paced throughout toward the inside. CALIFORNIA SWING void of speed in trailing early, was never a serious threat. TAKE
CHARGE D'ORO raced in mid pack, was finished after a mile from between horses, continued to fade stretch.

Footnotes
BOB'S EDGE with the pace while three wide and confidently handled, put a head in front exiting the turn, edged clear past the furlong marker and
maintained a clear advantage to the wire under steady handling. SAFFA'S DAY in the second flight off the inside, angled out to be four wide into the lane,
rallied for the place spot while not a threat to the winner. MOLTO VIVACE lacked speed inside, moved out into the two path into the lane, rallied from
between rivals in upper stretch, well clear for the show, no threat to the top two. TWIRLING MAMBA within striking distance well out in the strip, four out to
five wide exiting the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a kick. EDGE TO EDGE broke alertly, dueled up front into the turn in the two path, vied
inside the winner into the lane, weakened in the drive. XTREME MAYHEM broke back, lacked speed, three wide out of the turn, made little impact in the
drive. COLD AS HELL with the pace while inside, continued to vie into the turn, gave way late in the turn. CHATTER BOX off step slow, trailed throughout in
showing little.

Footnotes
HILLARY G broke in good order, vied up front while between horses, disposed of the other speed to be clear into the lane, held the runner up comfortably
safe late. DOLLY DIMPLE pushed into gap just after the start, moved up to race in mid pack along the inside, continued to save ground turn, in some traffic
late in the bend, got through into the lane, finished willingly to be clear for the place, no real threat to the winner. UNBRIDLED TWISTER void of speed,
raced back, two path late turn in some traffic, brief wait, dropped inside entering the stretch, mild rally through some traffic to garner the show. LITTLE
BURRITO in mid pack, raced in the two path through much of the turn, traffic, saved ground into the lane, improved inside. HOT SPRINGS BLING off a step
slow, raced in the main body outside, fanned six wide turning for home, improved position while not serious threat. SPURWINK LANE behind the first flight,
five wide exiting the turn, came up empty for the drive. VERY SPICY off a step slow, raced back for a half, five wide into the lane, made little impact out in
the strip. CHOCTAW CHARLIE in the second flight off the inside, failed to muster a rally. RACHIE RACH vied up front closest to the inside, tired in the drive.
SWEET HOLINESS balked at loading, broke outward and awkwardly, remained always back. MOONSHINE PRINCESS was always outrun while four wide.
ALLOFOURDREAMS vied up front three wide early, stopped in the drive.
