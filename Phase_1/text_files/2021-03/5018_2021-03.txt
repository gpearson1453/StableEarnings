Footnotes
FERRIC pressed the early pace, raced two wide around the far turn through the stretch and finished well to draw clear late under strong handling. A SHEEN
CAT showed good early speed while racing along the inside down the backstretch, dug in in the upper stretch but couldn't match strides with the winner in
the drive to finish second best. HESALITTLE SHADY was forwardly placed early on, raced three wide in the lane and had no final winning bid. TEXAS
EMPIRE was allowed to settle early, raced three wide at the eighth pole and had no final bid. PAIN FOR GAIN was slow early on, raced four wide into the
upper stretch and never threatened. PHILOSOPHER vied for the early lead from the inside and gave way. DREAMIN OF GLORY dropped back early,
saved ground and never had a response. CHAN MAN failed to respond. KINGDOM QUALITY settled towards the back of the pack early and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
MATRICULATE was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and finished well to get up under strong encouragement. HERBIE
showed good early speed while racing along the inside, led inside the eighth pole but couldn't hold off the winner in the final stages to be second best.
AMERIPOINT was unhurried early on, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and showed good late interest. MAXIMUS THE GREAT stalked the early
pace, raced four wide into the lane and had no late response. HESABULLY was slow early, raced four wide at the three sixteenths pole and never was a
factor. XAVIER DAVEY pressed the early leader and weakened. WILD DRIVE raced up close early on and tired along the inside. CREAKY CRICKET failed
to sustain a bid.

on, moved up four deep at the eighth marker and was no match for the winner in the drive. EXPLOSIVE SHOES set all the pace and weakened in the drive.
OFFICER SID raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no rally. GOLD NOTE was unhurried early, raced towards the inside throughout and had no
response. SPUNKY KITTEN was slow early, moved up four wide at the three sixteenths pole an never was a factor. SMARTY GRIMES saved ground and
never threatened. COASTLINE SERMON failed to respond. MASTERPIECE DAY raced up close in the early stages, raced three wide and tired. DIRECT
