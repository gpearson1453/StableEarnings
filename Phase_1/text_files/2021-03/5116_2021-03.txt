Footnotes
SUPREMACY sparred on the lead to deep stretch, cleared into stretch, confidently handled late to hold sway on the wire. PURPLE DREAM lost best
chance at the start, far back to turn, late run from the quarter pole while probably best today. JERRY'S SECRET quick outside to the lead, dueled to deep
stretch and weakened late for the show spot. EMPHASIZE never far back to the turn, mild bid in the stretch run but flattened out in the drive.
MISCHIEVOUS ROGUE slow into stride from gate, rushed wide to the turn, leveled off throughout. NINE REAPER chased pace inside to deep stretch,
faltered in the drive. TEXAS GANO never menaced. FLASH ON BY chased to quarter pole, gave way readily in the stretch. HORNSWOGGLE never a
menace. DOGWOODS COSBY bothered start and dropped far back. BREAKERS ROAR bore in start and never a factor.

Footnotes
LIKE THE KING no speed to far turn, advanced coming into the stretch, swiped rival while forced into that one, regrouped and cleared in the final stages to
hold off challenger to the wire. SAINTHOOD had a problematic trip to far turn, shuffled back into far turn inside, brushed into stretch and rallied in earnest for
the place spot in a gallant effort. HOCKEY DAD never far back to far turn, between horses into the stretch to rally for the show spot. HARD RYE GUY no
speed to far turn, bore out into stretch causing problems and raced evenly late. GRETZKY THE GREAT tracked leaders, all out to the quarter pole, gained a
short lead but gave way from the rail. MOONLITE STRIKE speed to the front, racing erratic throughout and gave way from the turn. DYN O MITE within
striking distance to far turn outside with no late response when needed. AWESOME GERRY broke sharp, close up early while steadied along down
backstretch with a steady fade from the half. KING'S OVATION broke sharp but never reached contention. SMILEY SOBOTKA was through early and
dropped far back. TARANTINO bobbled at the start, lost best chance and stayed far back to the wire and walked off on his own after being eliminated at the
start.

Footnotes
LOST WISH tracked three wide to turn, took over, all out to hang on at wire. NATALIES CHARM no speed, floated widest into stretch, coming on quickly,
missed. TEXAS MELODY awkward start, steady advance outside for the show spot. VILLAGE QUEEN never far back raced evenly for the minor share.
CROSS THE T'S unhurried early, rallied to improved position late. MISS ALEJANDRA tracked from outside to turn, flattened out in the drive. STRONG
ATTRACTION never menaced. TAKE A PEAK through early, dropped back. DARK HONEY dueled from the two path, weakened in the stretch. SAINT J J
bumped start, off slow, never close. IRON LADY AWAY dueled inside to the turn, gave way readily. PRINCESS CELESTE always outrun.
