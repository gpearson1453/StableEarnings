GOLD AND STRIKE closed to the lead outside nearing the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge three wide on the turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and
drew off the final sixteenth. FIRST LADY MAGGIE contested the early pace and raced at a close disadvantage between horses on the turn, but dropped

in through the lane and just missed second. COUNTRY MAGIC chased through the backstretch, raced two deep on the turn and finished evenly to pass
rivals. CHIEFS KINGDOM gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. SOLID AS A ROCK contested the early pace
inside and raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, but dropped back mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth.

SEATTLE SAILAWAY pressured the pace and raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, dueled to the lead mid-stretch and edged clear later
yards. ROCK BREAK set a pressured pace inside and contested the edge at the rail on the turn, dug in with the advantage from the head of the lane but
gave up the nod inside the sixteenth pole and relented later yards. BIGAIRTOTHETHROWN chased through the backstretch and raced in range of the lead
in the three path of the turn, drifted to the five path nearing the top of the stretch and finished evenly. HUCKLEBERRY FRIEND gave chase from well off the
pace and showed little in the lane. ROCK FILE gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the four path, drifted a bit wider into the stretch then weakened.
VIDMER'S COURAGE bobbled from the gate then gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn then drifted toward the head of the lane.

the far turn at the rail and dug in under steady encouragement to hold off the late advance of OLD LINE MAGIC, who settled off the pace inside the opening
turn then eased outward into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved four wide on the far turn, dug in from the top of the stretch
and was gaining steadily on the winner. UPSY DAISY DO saved ground off the pace, bid from the seven sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the far
turn, but flattened stride inside the eighth pole. FINDER ANGEL R V F raced off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep then flattened stride. JEAN GREY raced in the four and five paths the opening turn and left the turn outside,
rounded the far turn about the three path and passed rivals in the lane. BLAZING BOURBON rounded the first turn about the four path, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, came through the far turn in the seven path and showed little more. IRISH FIX rounded the first turn in the five path and stalked into the

CANDY INVASION settled back inside the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole and came through the far turn
about the three path, drifted to the five path approaching the head of the lane, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and drew off under a strong hand ride. FIBER
STRONG rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, dueled clear of SPANGLISH midway on the far turn, but was
caught mid-stretch and just held on for second, while the latter entered the first turn about the four path then stalked through the turn, challenged
approaching the three eighths pole and dueled close from that point, but dropped back midway on the far turn, though, came back later yards and was
gaining on the early leader. ISHIHARA saved ground off the pace, bid into the backstretch and raced near the rail on the far turn, eased outward in the
upper stretch but flattened stride the final furlong. STRINGFELLA settled off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole but faded in the four path of the far turn. EXECUTIVE PRIZE raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response.

NAJWA gave chase and raced in the three and four paths of the turn, dug in from the head of the lane to get up late yards and raced clear under the wire.
I'M A TOTAL DIVA angled to the inside to set the pace, raced at the rail on the turn and dug in under steady encouragement, was caught in late yards,
though, took the nod for second. MY PRETTY EYES gave chase inside, dug in leaving the turn and came between horses in late stretch, then just missed
the nod for second. TRIPLE GALA chased toward mid track, came through the turn about the four path and finished evenly. A HARD DAZE NIGHT angled
toward the outside to give early chase, rounded the turn about the five path and finished evenly. WHISKEY TALKING angled out to give chase, raced in the
five path of the turn and showed little further. WOODSONG'S CASTLE gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and had little left.
DAUGHTEROFTHESTARS was eased shortly after the start and walked off.

GREEK SONNET surged clear leaving the chute and set a pressured pace, dug in from the three eighths pole to turn back the challenge of Fifth Illusion,
widened at the rail on the turn and was unchallenged in the stretch. PAINT ME PRETTY gave distant chase through the backstretch, steadily improved off
the rail on the turn, angled to the four path nearing the head of the lane and dueled through the stretch to take second the final yards. SMOOKIE chased
inside, raced near the rail on the turn then ceded second the final yards. J C THE DESTROYER gave chase off the rail then flattened stride inside the
sixteenth pole. HURRICANE DIRECTOR gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the seven path and finished evenly. SHACKLETOWN
raced well back and well off the rail, came through the turn about the four path and passed rivals through the lane. FIFTH ILLUSION engaged in close chase
from the three eighths pole but drifted to the six path nearing the top of the stretch and weakened. LINEAGE chased outside, steadied approaching the five
sixteenths pole and weakened in the four path of the turn. VEE TEE was not a factor. HIDE gave chase outside then weakened wide on the turn.
