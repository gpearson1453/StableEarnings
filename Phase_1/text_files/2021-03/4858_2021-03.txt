Footnotes
SAWYOUINOURDREAM vied for the early lead, raced in the three path through the stretch and held gamely under all out pressure. SWEET ECLIPSE was
hustled along from the inside, headed the leader at the eighth pole but couldn't match strides late to finish second best. PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER stalked
the pace from the outside, moved up five wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly to the wire. HOLIDAY CHIMES raced up close early
on, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and had no final winning bid. COWGIRL COURT dropped back early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and
never was a factor. HOT HABANERO vied for the lead from the inside and gave way. FLOPPY was slow early and trailed throughout.

clear under steady handling. ROCK CITY ROADHOG stalked the early leaders, while racing four deep, continued to race four wide into the upper stretch
and was no match for the winner in the drive. MINER HEAT showed good speed along the inside and weakened through the drive. PODEROSO EQUS
went to his nose at the break, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. HOLIDAY JOKE was slow early, saved ground and had no response.

SILVER MAKER stalked the early pace, moved up five wide through the lane and just got up in his final stride under all out pressure. LISBON stalked the
pace, took command through the far turn, raced four wide at the eighth pole and just missed in a game effort. ALEUTIAN HARBOUR pressed the early
leader while racing two wide down the backstretch and weakened a bit in the drive along the inside. FLANAGAN raced in tight quarters soon after the break,
moved up six wide into the upper lane and had not enough. STRAIT N' SILENT stalked the pace from the outside, raced three deep nearing the eighth pole
and had no late response. ARCH'S WILD showed good speed from the inside and gave way. DRAX was off a step slow, dropped to the back of the pack
and never was a factor. GOOD OLD LUNCH BOX settled off the early pace and failed to respond.

stretch and was no match for the winner late. BARTENDERS MISTAKE stalked the pace, moved up along the rail in the stretch and had not enough late. L
B GOLD was allowed to settle early, raced two wide in the lane and had no final winning bid. YAYASGOTMOREGAME set all the pace and weakened in the

sixteenths pole and weakened. CREEDS REVENGE raced four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. NAME THE PRICE raced up close in the
early stages and tired.
