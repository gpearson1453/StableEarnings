Footnotes
FOUETTE broke alertly to be with the pace from the start, vied between horses up the backstretch, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, disposed of
the other speed exiting the bend, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. SHOSHONI MOON in the second flight while outside, raced three
wide through the turn, moved a bit closer on the outside late in the bend, proved no match through the stretch, clearly second best. CHURCH SERVICE
raced back off the pace toward the inside, two path through the turn, improved position through the lane to be up for the show. MONTGOMERY PARK
contested the issue early three wide, dueled through the turn outside the winner, weakened in the drive. COPPELIA lacked speed while racing outside,
angled out to be four wide when improving into the lane, flattened out a bit the final furlong. H'RAYFORCABERNEIGH settled in mid pack just off the inside,
continued one paced through the stretch in lacking a closing kick. AS IT SHOULD BE off a step slow, dropped inside, advanced up the rail then checked off
a rival's heels into the turn, fell back, waited when once again lacking room turning for home, understandably had little for the drive. MY MY MUNNY broke
in good order, vied up front inside the winner early, began a steady retreat along the rail before a half. AKA LIONESS fell back to trail out in the strip, three
wide turn, not a factor in the drive.

Footnotes
KABOOM BABY broke a bit to the outside, back off the pace toward the inside early, waited briefly in some traffic midway on the turn, steered out to be five
wide into the lane, bid outside the leader past the furlong marker, edging clear late. BIG ON BROADWAY lacked early foot, circled strongly into contention
with a five wide advance through the turn, took over and was clear upper stretch, could not contain the winner, clearly second best. MY GRACE forwardly
placed early inside, steadied off the leader's heels into the turn, fell back, continued to save ground, chased the top two late, just lasted to gain the nod for
the show. ROSE MARIE B void of early foot off the inside, rallied 4-5w out of the turn, finished willingly to narrowly miss the show. LIFE OF SATURDAYS
bothered start, raced in the second flight two path, bit closer when in tight quarters late backstretch, two path into the lane, finished up evenly. RUN
FEARLESS forwardly placed off the inside, three wide turn, came up empty for the drive. OLIVIAN broke well, set the pace toward the inside, faltered in the
drive. EMERALDS R US lacked speed, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick. TOMS MAXIMILLIAN squeezed back early, lacked a bid. WICKED
STREET forwardly placed while four wide into and through the turn, tired in the drive. PEANUT in some traffic early, was finished before a half.

Footnotes
AMERICAN MANDATE close up from the start inside, vied into and through the turn remaining closest to the rail, shook off the other speed when
straightened for home, responded when confronted from the outside late, held late rival safe to the wire under brisk handling. KADRI within striking distance
early while outside, continued four wide through the turn, lodged a late bid outside the winner, denied, clear for the place. BREAKING NEWS broke in, was
straightened but was void of speed outside, rallied four out to five wide leaving the turn, finished willingly to be up for the show late. NO SHIRT NO SHOES
broke on top, set or forced the pace outside the winner for a half and began to weaken. ALOHA WEST pinched back dramatically at the start to spot the
field a couple of lengths, dropped inside to improve through the turn, flattened out a bit the final furlong. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK floated out at the start,
was straightened to race forwardly for four furlongs, had little left for the stretch run. BACKSHOT remained back in failing to threaten. STURGILL broke out
pushing out a rival, recovered to race forward early then began a steady retreat after three furlongs. HURTS SO GOOD pushed in start forcing ALOHA
WEST back, was always outrun.

the stretch while being confronted from the outside by a pair of rivals, set down when straightened for home, displayed good resolve by digging in late to
narrowly prevail inside the runner up. LETRUSKA allowed the winner to early while racing three wide, stalked the middle half, crept closer while widest of
the first flight in the second turn, got out exiting that bend, got back to the winner from the outside late, bid, outkicked in the late going to miss.
GETRIDOFWHATAILESU last away, trailed while racing off the inside, two path through the second turn, dropped to the rail for the drive, rallied mildly to
gain the nod for the show in the final stride, no real threat to the top pair. ENVOUTANTE moved off the inside behind the winner early in the first turn,
prompted that rival in the run up the backstretch, asked along when moving to challenge between the top two turning for home, flattened out in the final
furlong, nipped for the show. MOTION EMOTION wtihin striking distance just off the inside, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
SILVER STATE unhurried early off the inside, began to move far turn, challenged four wide into the stretch, gained a bit of a larger advantage in upper
stretch, set down soon after, dueled the final furlong inside the runner up, prevailed while fully extended. RATED R SUPERSTAR last away, trailed well
back, moved out a bit and followed the winner to the front final turn, five wide into the lane, lost some ground to the victor, reengaged that one from the
outside past the furlong marker, showed good determination to the end. NIGHT OPS in the second flight while racing off the inside, remained within striking
distance into the far turn, challenged three wide and between foes inside the winner turning for home, briefly vied with that one and the runner up, could
keep up with that pair in the run to the wire, remained clear of the others. HARPERS FIRST RIDE broke on top, dueled up front along the inside, narrowly
showed the way into and through most of the final turn, weakened when the real runner began at the head of the lane. GREEN LIGHT GO dueled up front in
the two path, gave way from between horses exiting the final turn. UPHOLD in the second flight while toward the inside, two path far turn, faded.

Footnotes
SPECIAL RESERVE broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch inside, shook off a rival nearing the furlong grounds, remained clear to the wire under
steady pressure. ONE FOR RICHIE behind the pace toward the inside, two path upper stretch, dropped inside of traffic past the furlong marker, finished up
willingly to earn the place. ANCIENT WARRIOR settled off the pace while outside, four wide through the turn, staged a rally outside to annex the show,
outkicked for the place spot. SECRET COURIER prompted the pace while three wide, lacked a closing punch in the drive. ROYAL DAAHER broke back,
moved up steadily into contention off the inside, dueled outside the winner through the turn, continued one equal terms with that one into the stretch then
could not keep up the final furlong. AMERICAN BUTTERFLY in the main body early, dropped to the inside, traffic midstretch, also lacked a closing kick.
FULL AUTHORITY broke back and was never a threat. FAST BREAKIN CASH last to leave, was never a factor in picking off a couple of tiring rivals. BEST
OF GREELEY lacked speed, came three wide out of the turn, had little left in fading through the stretch. MARVIN behind the pace early, steady retreat three
wide.

CARLOS L. broke on top showed the way through the first turn in the two path by a wide margin, rated along down the stretch the first time, shrugged off a
mild bid onto the backstretch, continued to set the pace in hand, roused when confronted once again for the drive, rider lost crop a furlong out, found more
late. LONE ROCK settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer in the three path late in the second turn, vied past the furlong marker outside the winner,
could not get by despite brisk handling. TENFOLD void of speed while saving ground, began to move far turn, altered course around a tiring rival turning into
the stretch, challenged inside the top two late, also did not have enough in the late going. TREASURE TROVE went one paced throughout in lacking a
closing response. CAMPAIGN fell quickly back to trail after the start, lagged far back, off the inside, continued outside in the run through the second turn,
dropped inside when advancing late in the third bend, improved position while not a serious threat. PLAINSMAN closest to the winner toward the inside,
pursued that one onto the backstretch, brief bid outside, fell back, rebid between rivals turning for home and then faltered. YOU'RE TO BLAME evenly
paced three wide, remained outside, had little left for the drive in tiring. SPLIT THE WICKETS off a step slow, trailed home.

Footnotes
C Z ROCKET last to leave, well out in the strip backstretch under some patient handling, came four out to five wide exiting the turn, roused nearing the
furlong grounds, closed with good resolve to be up in time. WHITMORE outrun in the early going outside, three wide into the turn, tipped out four wide
turning into the stretch, put a head in front approaching the furlong marker, responded when pressured, relented grudgingly to the winner in the waning
strides. FLAGSTAFF away in good order, prompted the pace from along the inside, continued to save ground when pushing the leader through the turn, rail
bid into the stretch, briefly raced on equal terms with the top two with less than a furlong remaining then could not keep up the final sixteenth, well clear of
the others. FIRECROW broke sharply, soon clear, set the pace in the two path, headed when straightened for home, faltered. BOLDOR broke back, saved
ground through the turn off the pace, crept slightly closer entering the stretch, lacked a closing punch. ENGAGE in mid pack while off the inside, three wide
early turn, two path exiting when roused, also found wanting in the final furlong. MR. JAGERMEISTER prompted the leader for a half in the three path, had
little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
CONCERT TOUR broke on top despite bobbling slightly, cleared into the first turn, raced a bit keenly through that bend, relaxed in the run up the
backstretch while pressured, shrugged off CADDO RIVER at will when straightened for home to be well clear, throttled down late to prove clearly best.
HOZIER lacked speed while saving some ground in the first turn, continued unhurried the middle half, dropped inside and stayed on the rail into the stretch
to improve position, prevailed for the place inside of several rivals, no threat to the winner. BIG LAKE forwardly placed toward the inside, steered out three
wide into the lane, bothered when CADDO RIVER came out with a furlong remaining, soundly bumped HET HER NUMBER, was straightened and was
slowly getting to the runner up late. SUPER STOCK four wide into the first turn, angled in a bit to save some ground, remained back up the backstretch, two
to three wide in the second turn, improved position through some traffic with some mild interest down the lane. CADDO RIVER broke in mid pack, moved
closer past the wire the first time, came off the inside when rank and pursuing the winner through the first turn, continued closest to that one, asked along
turning for home, came up empty in failing to keep up, came out with a furlong to run bothering BIG LAKE who in turn bumped GET HER NUMBER,
weakened in the late going to lose a couple of positions. KEEPMEINMIND last away, raced three out to four wide first turn, continued outside, four out to
five wide through the second bend, failed to fire when set down for the drive. GET HER NUMBER in mid pack off the inside, three wide through the second
turn, angled four for the drive, soundly bumped when BIG LAKE was bothered by CADDO RIVER with a furlong to run, weakened. TWILIGHT BLUE in the
second flight while racing three wide, continued in the three path through the second turn when in a bit of traffic, retreated through the stretch.

GENERAL TREV forwardly placed while off the inside, pressed the winner from the outside the middle half, could not match the winner in the drive, narrowly
saved the place while between horses at the wire. SOLOMONIC within striking distance while saving all the ground, remained in the second flight inside
inside, set down for the drive, could not get to the runner up late while prevailing for the show. KATZARELLI forwardly placed off the inside, in the second
flight between foes second turn, came three wide into the lane, finished up evenly to be outkicked for the place spot as well. POLAR WIND last to leave,
trailed while saving ground, continued inside, moved out a bit, split foes past the furlong marker, found best stride too late. NILES CHANNEL lacked speed
while racing off the inside, improved position slightly while not serious threat. OPTIMUS KAT void of speed, in the two path and inside of several rivals
turning for home, came up empty for the drive. OFF THE MEDS one paced while four wide first turn, moved inside, saved some ground in the second turn,
failed to muster a rally in the drive. F F ROCKET in the main body, moved outside, four wide through the final turn, had nothing for the drive. HANDY settled
off the pace and the inside, five wide through the second turn, lacked a response in the drive. ORO DE TEJANO remained always back to be outrun. ROB
THE RICH within striking distance off rail, stopped in the drive.
