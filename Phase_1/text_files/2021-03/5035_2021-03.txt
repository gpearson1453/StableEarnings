Footnotes
IN CHARGE HALO strolled to the front, was well rated in the two path while setting the pace on an easy lead, responded well when asked at the
quarter-pole, drifted in under a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, drifted out from a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker, was straightened
by the rider while clear into the final sixteenth then given one last pop of a left-handed crop before being placed under a hand ride to the wire in victory.
RIFLE MAN broke out and bumped with a foe then dropped back, went around the first turn in the two path under restraint, was reserved behind horses at
the rear of the field, dropped back off while climbing some leaving the backstretch then shifted four wide, continued four wide through the far turn, came six
wide into the stretch, gained outside in the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. STAR BANJO was hustled from the start, saved ground on the
first turn, was well placed just off the pace, came under urging while inside on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the drop, angled out in pursuit of the
winner at the sixteenth-pole and also finished willingly but just missed the place. REMEMBERMIS broke out at the start then was hustled, went four wide on
the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused four then five wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick.
TAKEN BACK broke a bit slow, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, raced three then four wide while asked on the far turn,
turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. ALMA DERBY was bumped at the start, went three wide while a bit keen on the first
turn, tracked the pace on the outside, raced in the three path on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, chased into upper stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
GAM'S MISSION went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the far turn, rallied outside in upper stretch, closed
strongly to get the lead into the final sixteenth, swapped back to her inside lead at that point, battled with the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed
under strong urging. SPEED LANE was hustled to the lead then taken in hand, set an uncontested pace in the two path, controlled the action through the far
turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth-pole then was headed by the winner, fought with that foe to the wire and just
missed while clear for the place. LOVE IN THE AIR was taken under a tight hold early, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came
under coaxing with a half-mile to run, steadied to avoid the injured rival at the three-eighths, went three wide on the far turn, steadied repeatedly from
outside the quarter-pole into the stretch, moved out at the three-sixteenths then brushed with a foe and finished willingly for the show in a tough trip.
TRANSIENT (GB) bumped with a rival at the start, fought the restraint of the rider when taken under a tight hold early, saved ground while tugging at the bit
on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, checked to avoid the injured foe at the three-eighths, rounded the far turn in the two path, swung six wide into
the stretch, brushed with a foe inside the three-sixteenths and gained but failed to seriously threaten. BELLA CONCHITA bumped with a rival at the start,
went four wide on the first turn, shied out late on that bend then was given some right-handed encouragement, settled outside under some urging, chased
four wide on the far turn, pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. PERFECT LIMIT went three wide on the first turn, tracked
the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn and came up empty. PEACE BROKER was well placed on the inside, went wrong at the
three-eighths and was pulled up then vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE FAR TURN, NO CHANGE WAS
MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

FLAT OUT AMERICAN settled on the inside, moved out while becoming rank near the half-mile pole, leveled out again near the seven-sixteenths, went
around the turn in the two path, was put to a drive in upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong and closed fast last to get up at the wire. SAINT GOAR was
well placed towards the front, dropped back while lugging out some leaving the backstretch, was guided around the turn in the two path under extra left-rein
pressure, shifted four wide into the stretch, gained to make an outside bid at the furlong marker, took the lead outside the sixteenth-pole, led until the final
stride but was denied while able to get the place. B W P SPECIAL disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, shook clear in upper
stretch, lost the lead inside the furlong marker and was outfinished while well clear for the show. PILOT PRINCE disputed the pace on the inside of a foe,
vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and capitulated. FERRYBOAT was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths,
settled on the far outside, went five then six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker and failed to threaten.
BLACK HAWK RIDGE tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. PASION
AZTECA settled off the pace, went five wide under urging on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. PER RULING DATED 5/21/2021
RECEIVED FROM THE LOUISIANA STATE RACING COMMISSION (RULING #24346), FLAT OUT AMERICAN WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
WINNERS CLUB was bumped in the shoulder by two foes at the start while off a step slow, raced inside to the two path under tight restraint on the first turn,
settled more kindly on the backstretch, drafted inside to the two path on the far turn, shoved his way out outside the three-sixteenths and bumped soundly
with a foe, rallied to the lead outside the furlong marker and prevailed under strong urging. ROCHAMBEAU went three wide on the first turn, was reserved
off the pace, came under urging while three wide on the far turn, was bumped in upper stretch, rallied outside to make a bid into the final furlong but was
outfinished while just able to get the place. GHOST OF THE MAMBO bumped with a rival at the start, went four then three wide on the first turn, settled at
the rear, moved closer late on the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong and closed
well to just miss the place. SLIABH AUGHTY (FR) went to the front, set the clear pace in the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a
drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and was out-kicked. IN SKY WE TRUST saved ground on the first turn, was reserved
off the pace, went three wide on the far turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, angled out under a drive in upper stretch, advanced into a reasonable
striking position into the final furlong but flattened out and lacked the needed kick. BLUE BOON broke out and bumped with a rival, went three wide on the
first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, raced three wide on the far turn, came under urging at the quarter-pole, was bumped outside the three-sixteenths
then forced into another foe and tired. IMPLICATION broke out and bumped with a foe, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, went four wide
on the far turn and failed to threaten. GRAVES MILL ROAD tugged hard at the bit under restraint early, moved from the three path to the six path on the first
turn, settled on the far outside, dropped to the rear while six wide on the far turn and faltered. MAGNA RIDE broke out and bumped with a foe, went five
then six wide for most of the first turn then dropped to the four path, settled near the back, went four wide on the far turn and also faltered.

most of the turn then dropped to the four path, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. BROADWAY JONES raced well back in the field,
went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. ROUX GA ROUX chased the early pace on the outside, made a bid near the half-mile pole, vied

Footnotes
STEPH'S SPIRIT angled in while going to the front, shook foes while inside on the turn, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch and drew
off under steady urging. BOX OF PICTURES broke out and bumped hard multiple times with a rival, nearly unseated the rider then had the rider lose his left
iron, regained the iron before the five-eighths, went two then three wide on the turn, gained five wide into the stretch but proved no match for the winner
while able to get the place. DELTA TRAVELER was bumped at the start then forced into another foe, settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came
five wide into the stretch and was along for the show. STRUMMER was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced at the back, went three to four
wide on the turn and failed to threaten. SUMMER IS HOT angled in while showing speed then chased the pace, moved up to make a bid near the half-mile
pole, dropped back in the two path on the turn and came up empty. FUHR MEO settled on the outside, dropped back while four wide on the turn, came six
wide into the stretch, moved further out around the three-sixteenths and had nothing left. SWEET JACKIELEIGH broke in and bumped with an opponent,
moved out near the five-eighths then chased the pace, went three wide on the turn and tired. MERCEDES LADIES lost her footing at the start then bumped
multiple times with foes on both sides, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond. TETON TWILIGHT bumped soundly with foes on both sides
multiple times at the start, was hard held while rank down the backstretch, saved ground while guided around the turn with heavy left-rein pressure and also
failed to respond. APHRODITES REVENGE broke a step slow, settled on the outside, went four wide on the turn and was no factor.
