wide, moved up four wide through the lane and just missed in a game effort. SYDNEY ELIZABETH stalked the early pace, raced along the inside and
throughout and finished willingly to the wire. LILFEATHEREDINDIAN stalked the early leaders, moved up wide past the three sixteenths pole and had not
enough in the drive. IMPASSION raced three wide at the eighth pole and had no final winning bid. RUN'N DOWN A DREAM raced four wide into the upper
stretch and never was a factor. RHINE FALLS was hustled along from the inside and had no response. TSURUOKA dropped back early, saved ground and
never threatened. DREAMINGNDIAMONDS was slow early and failed to respond. VALIANT QUIZ raced towards the back of the pack and was eased up on

GHOST SQUAD pressed the pace from the outside, raced two wide through the lane and finished well to get up under strong pressure. BLIGHT stalked the
pace from the inside, angled four wide through the lane and got up for the place position late. PREACHER vied for the lead from the inside and weakened.
TIGER THE MAN stalked the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. THE FRANCHISE dropped back early, raced along the
inside in the lane and had no rally. DOUBLE ONE SHOT was hustled from the outside, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.
PHILOSOPHER dropped back early and failed to menace. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK was slow early and failed to respond. LOUIE'S DREAM saved
ground and never threatened. I LIVED IT dropped back early, bolted on the turn, straightened away in the stretch and never threatened.
