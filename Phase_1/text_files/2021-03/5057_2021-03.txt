BABY BAM BAM hustled to the front inside, repelled challenges, edged clear again and remained safe. DILLY DILLY PHILLY dropped back at the start,
chased very wide and finished gamely to earn the place. BUCKS SOME pressed the winner from the outset. continued well just missing the place.
MAGICAL ANNA settled inside the leaders, loomed threat in the stretch but flattened out. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR lacked speed and was never a factor.
HERO FOR HIRE prompted the pace three wide to the stretch and proved empty. CREEDIBILITY broke slowly and raced far back throughout.

HEROIC OFFICER controlled the pace inside, was reserved on the turn, was asked for run in the stretch and remained safe driving. ZECHA lacked speed,
advanced inside and closed well too late. BANGLE GAL pursued the winner outside, loomed a threat into the stretch but tired. FRISKY FEELING lagged far
behind, altered course rallying in the stretch with a mild bid. BAAQEYA was urged close up inside off the pacesetter and faltered. REIGNING FIRE broke
alertly and saved ground then gave way on the turn. MAD MARY lacked speed and was never in contention. ENCHANTABULL broke a step slowly and was
always outrun.

Footnotes
KID MACHO settled three wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn, rallied outside of the pacesetter entering the stretch, took over past midstretch and
drew clear under urging. FROST'S SONG cleared the field entering the first turn, set the pace, opened up a comfortable margin, showed the way on the far
turn, dug in gamely in the stretch and came up second best. MAMAIGOTTHIS was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, moved up entering the
stretch, split rivals and closed late to get third. FRAY was in tight on the rail and steadied entering the first turn, then chased inside, rallied mildly and lost
third on the wire. BIG BAD BUD raced five wide early, settled off the pace, moved up on the far turn, went four wide past the quarter pole and lacked a rally.
HEART OF A DREAMER was bumped at the start, stalked four wide, chased on the turn and tired. YONDERING raced four wide early, settled off the pace
and did not factor. BILL'S MAFIA chased two wide and faded.

MARVALOUS MIKE dueled outside, took over nearing the quarter pole then drew off under moderate pressure. RUFFY close up inside, angled out to
secure room on the turn, rallied but was no match for the winner. DOCTOR DOOM saved ground early, drifted very wide on the turn and closed well.
UNCLE ROAMIE dueled in the two path then inside to the stretch and weakened. DENNARD chased three wide off the leaders and flattened out in the
stretch. AUSTIN WHYLIE underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, dropped back in the opening quarter and was always outrun. RUN WHITE RABBIT
raced between rivals off the pace and gave way. HE'S A SHOOTER prompted the pace three wide then began retreating on the turn. TIZ EFFECTIVE
saved ground and weakened steadily. BIZZY GILLESPIE broke slowest and trailed throughout.

BARINGER SPRING stalked close up between rivals, rallied three wide at the quarter pole, dug in gamely outside in the stretch drive, rallied to a short lead
past midstretch and then held on late to prevail. CHAMPERS was bumped at the start, tracked close up on the inside, raced behind horses turning for
home, lacked room at the eighth pole, split rivals at the sixteenth marker and surged late to just miss. JAYJAYDEE was bumped at the start, pressed the
pace, bid nearing the quarter pole, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely between rivals and weakened late. SAMBAM was a bit reluctant to load, raced
three wide early, settled off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far turn and then failed to threaten. ABDAA raced off the pace inside, advanced inside
on the far turn and lacked a rally. KNOKKE BY THE SEA was bumped at the start and outrun. ROYAL COUP was bumped at the start, raced off the early
pace, then stalked three wide, chased and faded. POLITY set the pace on the inside, dueled into the stretch, gave way, was pulled up at the wire and
vanned off.

Footnotes
VOLODINA stalked the pace three wide, rallied into the stretch then edged away following a long drive. BIG RED SEVEN taken up sharply trying to split
rivals into far turn, recovered and advanced wide too late. ENIGMATICA set a measured pace inside, was collared into the stretch and continued well in a
game try. MISDRIVEN pressed the pace outside, faded after half a mile and was no threat. NOT IN THE MOOD saved ground off the leaders and gave
way. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT dropped back early racing wide and trailed throughout.
