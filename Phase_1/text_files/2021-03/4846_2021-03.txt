Footnotes
SPEECHIN N TEACHIN quickly went clear, controlled the pace while towards the rail, opened up after being put to a drive in upper stretch then maintained
a comfortable advantage while kept to steady hand encouragement through the final furlong. GREY GIANT settled off the rail, moved up three deep after a
half mile, gave hard pursuit from the the three eighths to the wire, finished willingly and was clearly second best. ARTILLERY stalked two wide and outside a
foe, chased between runners nearing the far turn, was no match for the top pair but kept giving effort to the line. PAT'S FACTOR saved ground stalking the
pace, chased to the inside of rivals heading towards the half mile marker, eased out some in upper stretch and finished with some interest. MANKLIN
CREEK broke a step slow, settled off the pace, moved up four wide outside rivals approaching the stretch but failed to sustain. DOUBLBARRELBOURBON
, bumped at the break, lost ground four wide early on, dropped in before going a half mile but lacked a stretch response. STRICTLY BUSINESS bobbled
outward at the break and bumped with a rival, saved ground around the first turn, dropped back past the three quarter pole and failed to generate a run.

SIR LENNY , off last after hopping a bit in the air and steadying off of MAGIC OF LOVE, regrouped and edged up while saving ground, was nudged on and
went through a rail seam to engage MAGIC OF LOVE, sparred into the far turn, shook clear under a light hold with three furlongs remaining, moved away
and was guided to about the two wide path into the stretch the pulled away eagerly while under a solid hand ride. GOSH , four wide early, dropped in
leaving the three quarter pole, steadily progressed inside foes leaving the far turn, gave hard pursuit into the lane, kept on with some effort and was clear of
the rest. WHO'S COUNTING , three wide, was sent up into the backstretch and forced the early issue, chased between runners nearing the five sixteenths
then faded through the drive. ALWAYS BIZ lost ground four wide, was under asking outside rivals leaving the far turn and gave way. MAGIC OF LOVE
broke outward, was corrected and cleared early in the two path, met an outside challenge past the seven eighths, dueled outside the winner from the five
eighths to the far turn, could not keep pace leaving the five sixteenths, faltered and was eased through the final furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
PRESS MY BETS prompted the pace three wide outside of SPEIGHTSFORD, moved to apply more pressure mid turn, took over into the lane, spurted clear
under a drive in mid stretch then dug in tenaciously to fend off HANALEI'S HOUDINI. HANALEI'S HOUDINI , three deep chasing the leaders, shifted four
wide into the lane, kept on grinding under strong handling but just couldn't quite get up. HONOR THE FLEET broke a bit slowly, hustled up soon after,
pursued between rivals around the turn and kept on with interest. AWESOME D J settled well back, angled four wide making some headway into the stretch
but failed to seriously sustain. OXIDE tracked the pace while saving ground, came under a ride mid turn, eased out some in the drive and faded. CLUBMAN
dropped well back in the opening furlong, saved ground leaving the far turn, swung wide in the drive but lacked a rally. SPEIGHTSFORD rushed up to take
command leaving the chute, went clear soon after and set the pace towards the rail, took pressure leaving the far turn, ceded command into the lane,
stayed willingly to about mid stretch then gave way. FORTUNATE FRIENDS , four wide, dropped back leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
EXCULPATORY , off last, raced in the two path around the turn and to mid stretch, angled out a bit, closed smartly between foes and was up approaching
the finish. RECKLESS PLACE saved ground around the turn, hugged the inner rail through the stretch, gained the lead inside the sixteenth pole and gave
way grudgingly. RIPPOLINO lacked speed, was wide leaving the turn, floated to the seven path in mid stretch and rallied outside foes. FORTH , two wide on
the turn, was well placed in the four path in mid stretch and weakened late. JOHN THE BEAR saved ground around the turn, disputing the pace, drifted out
in upper stretch and gave way the final furlong. BILLINGSGATE bobbled at the break, was five wide turning for home and failed to menace. UNCLE
ROAMIE disputed the pace to the eighth pole and weakened. DREAM HAPPY , four deep on the turn, gave way and was eased late.

Footnotes
VALUED NOTION quickly gained between rivals four wide and forged to command leaving the far turn, dropped in some and cleared, set the pace two wide
into the lane, widened in mid stretch, lugged in and hit the rail heading towards the sixteenth pole, recovered and held firm under a drive. JOSEF IS REAL
was urged up to contention, advanced three wide between foes mid turn, eased out and closed gamely to gain in the final furlong. HONOR RUN rated off
the early pace, gained four to five wide while between runners mid turn, straightened and closed steadily. KINGSTON PIKE broke a step slow, lagged off
the early pace, came seven wide for the drive and closed. ROYAL CRUSADER lacked speed, raced very wide past the three sixteenths and rallied. INSIDE
RISK , unseated his rider pre race and ran off a bit, moved up four wide mid turn, gave hard chase past the furlong grounds but was out finished between
runners. TOM TERRIFIC , off the pace, angled out leaving the far turn, came six wide for the drive and had a slight run. JOHN'S PROMISE saved ground,
angled out nearing the lane, shifted back in and rallied mildly. THE REVENGER dueled two wide early on, chased mid turn then tired. NAUTICAL NATURE
vied inside into the turn then tired. BOURBON STREET , five wide pursuing, faltered entering the stretch, was eased in the drive and walked off.
