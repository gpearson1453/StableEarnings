Footnotes
CARGO bobbled at the start, tracked closest to the leader to the leader a bit off the rail or two path, came three wide into the stretch, drew alongside the
leader and cleared late. BIG COUPE tracked in the two path then went outside a pair of rivals into the stretch, dove to the inside with a sixteenth to go and
got up for second. HAIL FREEDOM sped to the front and crossed to the inside, controlled the pace through the early stages, coaxed two wide leaving the
far turn, put to right-handed urging in the lane and got outfinished by the top pair. BUKAYO stalked the speed from inside to the stretch and went evenly
late. WHISKEY TALK stalked outside a rival then two or three wide, chased between foes in upper stretch and lacked a serious bid. ARMAVEER came
away slowly and took a bit to settle into strides, settled at the back of the pack and moved off the inside, traveled three wide into the drive and proved no
menace. CATFISH CHARLIE was off slow to begin, reserved in hand along the inside, saved ground into the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CONQUEST COBRA pressed the pace from inside, headed rival leaving the backstretch, dueled around the far turn, inched ahead in upper stretch and
edged clear late. IMPRESSION stumbled leaving the gate, set the pace outside of CONQUEST COBRA, dueled with that rival through the far turn, battled
through the stretch but flattened a bit in the final sixteenth. FABOZZI stalked off the inside, asked at the quarter pole, failed to find the needed late kick but
stayed on to secure the show. LEPRINO bobbled leaving the gate, pulled between rivals into the first turn, stalked outside a rival then took closer order up
the backstretch, went three to four wide into the drive and could not offer the needed response. SUPER CLASSIC trailed the field early from inside, came
out into the stretch and never threatened.

HARD METAL angled to the inside early then back out into the two path on the first turn, chased the leader through the early stages then took aim two wide
into the drive, bid outside nearing the furlong grounds and pulled clear under a drive. ROYAL ORB went four then three wide around the clubhouse turn,
exchanged bumps with inside rival near the five-eighths pole, came three wide into the stretch, dug in late and got up for the place. SIMMER DOWN sped to
the front and angled to the inside around the first turn, set all the pace to the stretch, held a short lead approaching the eighth pole, relinquished command
soon after and got nailed for the place. SKY NAVIGATOR raced along the inside then two wide on the first turn, traveled in mid-pack and bumped with
outside rival near the five-eighths, entered the far turn along the fence then exited two wide and could not rally. BEST DANCE steadied off heels while
angling in on the first turn, settled inside then came two wide into the drive, eased in the stretch and walked off. RACING ACE coaxed between rivals on the
first turn then dropped back, stayed off the rail to the stretch then got eased in the drive and walked off. SLEEP OVER broke out, dropped back quickly,

Footnotes
CHASIN MUNNY away quickly from the inside, set the pace with THANKS MR. EIDSON alongside, maintained a short lead to the stretch, urged left-handed
in the lane and held gamely to the wire. THANKS MR. EIDSON prompted the pace from outside to the stretch, put to right-handed urging at the top of the
lane, kept the pressure on the winner through the final furlong, switched to the left-hand late and could not get by. GHOUL (BRZ) raced off the pace, entered
the turn a bit off the rail, exited three wide then moved out four wide in upper stretch and gained ground late. RESTIANY (GB) settled early, saved ground
around the bend, moved out a bit and split foes near the sixteenth pole and improved position. COMMANDER (FR) stalked the top pair outside a rival or two
wide through the turn and into the stretch, chased three wide in upper stretch and flattened. SASH (GB) stalked the speed from inside through the bend and
flattened in the furlong grounds.

AMERICAN HEIGHTS up close early outside the leader, raced three deep around the turn and three to four wide into the stretch, gained the lead inside the
eighth pole but got nailed at the wire. SHARAPOVA went up to press from inside, dueled around the turn and into the stretch, held a short lead with a
furlong to go but got outkicked in deep stretch. LADY ACES unhurried off the rail, moved to the two path then angled out and came four wide into the lane,
tipped out in upper stretch and finished with a mild response. STRESSED set the pace with rivals on both sides, dueled around the turn in the two path, vied
between rivals in the lane and flattened out in the final sixteenth. CAPAREGIME stalked off the rail then steered to the two path entering the turn, remained
two wide to the stretch and weakened. ASSIGNATION chased the speed from inside to lane and faded.

Footnotes
DISKO FEVER showed early speed then took back to allow SUPER GAME to take control, switch outside that rival and applied pressure on the backstretch,
moved up on even terms then inched ahead around the final turn, cleared into the stretch, led through the final furlong and held over the runner-up. BIG
STRETCH saved ground through both turns, angled out entering the stretch, rallied and bested the rest. MICHALSKA stalked outside a rival then came
three wide into the drive and held the show. BIG BEAUTY sat off the pace through the early stages, angled out into the stretch, could not summon the
needed rally and missed the show. ST HELENA in range of the leaders along the inside, tipped out into the stretch, drifted in and bumped SUPER GAME
just inside the eighth pole and weakened. SUPER GAME sped to the front and vied outside of DISKO FEVER briefly before clearing and crossing over to
the inside, set the pace with that rival applying pressure up the backstretch, lost command near the five-sixteenths, chased inside to the stretch, got bumped
by ST HELENA just past the eighth pole and faded.

GOV FROM ABOVE raced between rivals into the first then in the three path, moved up to duel with the leader on the backstretch then inched ahead and
cleared at the seven-sixteenths, vied two wide with rivals past the quarter pole, drifted to the inside in upper stretch and edged clear. COALINGA ROAD
went three deep or four wide into the first turn, angled to the inside leaving that bend, went between rivals and bumped into the far turn, bid between the at
the quarter pole, fought with the winner in the drive and got outkicked in the late stages while clearly second best. AUTISMS WORLD sped to the front in the
two path, dueled with the winner near the inside, chased that rival past the half-mile marker, swung out leaving the far turn and kept on to earn the show.
CLAYTON DELANEY went four deep or five wide into the first turn, moved in a path around the bend, settled off the inside, bid three deep at the quarter
pole but weakened in the late stages. LIGHTNING FAST stumbled leaving the gate, raced off the rail then came three to four wide into the drive and was
never a factor. HAPI HAPI leaned back at the start to come away a bit slow, was fanned 5deep into the first turn, traveled six then five wide around that turn,
chased outside a rival then drifted out into the stretch, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
STANDING O sped to the front and steered inside to take control of the rail, showed the way along the inside into the stretch and stayed clear under
right-handed encouragement. BIG FLINT stalked along the inside, hugged the rail into the stretch, then rallied up the fence to gain the place. BLUE STAR
dropped back early, saved ground into the lane, moved into the two path then finished well between rivals in the closing moments. WARRENS CANDY MAN
went four wide into the first turn then angled into the two path, stalked outside a rival to the far turn, asked at the quarter pole, finished evenly and got
bothered by CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS in the final strides. CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS was closest in pursuit while not too far of the inside, took aim two wide
into the stretch, took an awkward step and shifted out late and got passed for minor placings. GORDY'S BOY raced off the pace while outside a rival,
traveled two wide around the far turn, moved out at the top of the lane and proved no menace. ALEXANDER'S DREAM was tight between rivals into the first
turn, moved to the inside and settled off the pace, remained inside then angled off the rail on the second bend, drifted inward approaching the eighth pole
and lacked further response.
