Footnotes
GRATS ROAD unhurried early gave a quick move on the far turn shaking clear in upper stretch holding firm to wire. LITTLE MATILDA stalked the pace
pressing in bid on the far turn, overpowered in upper stretch would stay on to save place near mid track. LUCKY TO HAVE ME stalked the pace through the
backside then was shuffled to last along the inside on the far turn, regrouped somewhat in upper stretch angling out improving past the others. ACT LIKE A
LADY stalked the pace rallying to a short lead on the far turn, overpowered in upper stretch would weaken in the four path. HIGH FIRE played no factor.
SHORE OF EDEN set the early pace being passed on the far turn wearing down under a drive. BUTTIE mounted a bid on the far turn then flattened out in
upper stretch.
