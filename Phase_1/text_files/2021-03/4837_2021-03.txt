COZY BEAR was up close early, raced five wide through the second turn, dueled with J J'S CROWN to late stretch, shook off that rival and held off
WARRIORS HERO for the win. WARRIORS HERO was void of any speed, advanced seven wide through the second turn, was gaining late and finished
second best. J J'S CROWN set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail throughout, dueled with the winner, drifted out and finished a game third. FLASH
OF GLORY was allowed to settle early, went six wide into the second turn and finished evenly late. NOVA STAR pressed the early pace, raced between
rivals into the home turn and faded. AUTISM CAN DO tracked the early pace, raced erratic, was eased and vanned off.

GRAND AIR tracked the early pace, went six wide into the turn, made a bid through the stretch, dueled with CATS SURFIN and prevailed for the win. CATS
SURFIN set a pressured early pace, went four wide into the turn, met the bid of the winner, dueled to the wire and finished second best. CIMPL MAN raced
in mid pack early, angled out seven wide in early stretch, was gaining late and needed more ground. MYSTICAL IMAGE pressed the early pace, went five
wide into the turn, couldn't keep up with the pace in early stretch and offered some late gain. BRICKBAT was void of speed, raced along the inside and
finished belatedly. CHATTERMAN was unhurried early, went three wide into the turn, angled out in early stretch and was no factor. LOVER BOY BOB was
settled early, raced eight wide and was no threat.

Footnotes
THECHAMPISFLORING set a clear early pace, drifted out five wide through the turn, kept the pace on and held for the win. SEEKARAP chased the early
pace, raced six wide out of the turn, was no match and held for second. POCO SUENOS was void of speed, went five wide into the turn, angled out, was
gaining late and needed more ground. OVERLOOKED tracked the early pace, went four wide into the turn, angled in and was empty late. IRISH SUNRISE
raced in mid pack, went three wide into the turn and weakened. IT'S ABOUT ALEX was outrun early, went six wide into the turn, angled in and finished
belatedly. ANGELS ON HIGH was allowed to settle early, raced seven wide and offered no rally. FAITH IN EXCESS was reserved early and was no factor.
TOP LADY MARGIE was taken back and was no threat. PLAYA CHICA was unhurried early and had no impact. FICETY LADY stalked the pace and
retreated.
