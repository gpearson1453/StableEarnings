Footnotes
SHOE GAME raced unhurried early, advanced six-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up with the rush to prevail in the
closing yards. BURNADEBT was away in good order to be reserved just off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, reached the fore into the
lane, opened a clear margin but could not resist the winner late. ARIZONA SUN was off slow, circled the field six-wide to press the pace of LASY PUNCH,
moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter and gave way through the final furlong. SIERRITA was allowed to settle early, moved seven-wide through the
turn and did not threaten. LAST PUNCH broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing four-wide and weakened through the final furlong.

Footnotes
BIG HOOF DYNAMITE lagged early, advanced seven-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and wore down BRICKBAT in
the final yards. BRICKBAT settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, gained command nearing the three-sixteenths pole but
could not match strides with the winner late. AMERICAN CAMP raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further
into the stretch and finished with a steady rally. MIDNIGHT REVERIE pressed the pace while racing five-wide and gave way after going six furlongs.
MATSON broke sharply to press the pace of EMPEROR'S CHOICE while racing four-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. EMPEROR'S CHOICE
was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide and gave way into the lane. SUPER CAT SPEED lacked early foot, raced six-wide
through the second turn and was not a factor.

LIFELINE settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good energy to gain the place. I'M AN EIGHT set a
pressured pace from the inside throughout and gave way grudgingly late. CALL YOU TOMORROW pressed the pace of IM AN EIGHT while racing
three-wide, moved up to engage that rival in mid-stretch but could not get by that foe. LOLLY EXPRESS bobbled at the start and was bumped, raced
four-wide through both turns, settled off the leaders early, angled out into the stretch and did not threaten. RATE FOR ME was bumped at the break, lacked
early foot, raced between foes through the second turn, checked nearing the sixteenth pole and did not offer a bid. BOB'S ALL IN raced off the pacesetters
early, moved six-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. INCREDIBLE LUCK showed brief speed and weakened.

MARVELOUS MARVELLA lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, waited for racing room nearing the quarter, angled out into the
stretch and wore down LADY LANA through the closing yards. LADY LANA settled off the leaders early, advanced six-wide through the second turn,
reached the fore with a furlong to run, opened a clear lead but could not resist the winner late. LEMON ICE raced four-wide through the first turn, was void
of early speed, raced eight-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady rally. SMILING AGAIN showed no early speed, raced four-wide through
the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly late. RUN LIKE KATE chased the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid
nearing the five-sixteenths pole, gained a brief lead and gave way. I'M ALL THE JEDI raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early,
moved six-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and failed to rally. PEEWEE'S LADY raced off the pacesetters from the
inside and lacked the needed response. MONICAT pressed the pace for the opening quarter while racing three-wide moved up soon after to offer a bid and

Footnotes
JUST CLASSY was allowed to settle early, advanced from the inside through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch, gained command and drew off with
complete authority. MY CRAFTY GAL raced four-wide through the first turn, stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, could not match strides with the
winner late but finished well to hold the place. EVERYBODY DOES IT lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the
stretch and finished with good late energy. CITYONTHENILE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin before
going three furlongs and gave way through the final furlong. TEQUILA MARY was pinched back at the start, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through
the second turn and finished evenly late. SPUN LINE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. DUTCH MAMA
pressed the pace while racing four-wide for a half and weakened.
