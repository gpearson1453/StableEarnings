SMART SET set a clear early pace, raced off the rail into both turns, opened up in mid stretch, drifted out and edged clear for the win. BEACH GETAWAY
was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside through the home turn, was no match, angled out and finished second best. IN THE RED tracked the
early pace, went four wide into the second turn drifted out mid stretch and was empty late. I'M SO ADORABLE followed the early pace, went three wide into
the second turn and weakened. WILLING TO BURN was void of any early speed, raced along the inside and offered no rally. MS SALLY was unhurried
early, went five wide into the second turn and offered no factor.

Footnotes
MASTER RULER forced the early pace, raced along the inside into the turn, took a brief lead, met the bid of HERMANO, dueled with that rival and prevailed
for the win. HERMANO was allowed to settle early, raced six wide through the turn, was closing mid stretch, made a bid on the winner, dueled and just
missed. A NEW TREND was unhurried early, circled eight wide through the turn, was gaining late and needed more ground. BUBBA NIGHTLINGER chased
the early pace, raced five wide and weakened. CONQUEST MOONMAD set a clear early pace, went three wide and faded. TIZ WAY COOL was outrun
early, went four wide into the turn, angled out and finished evenly. WALK ON WATER was taken back early, raced between rivals and offered no late rally.
GAMBLERS GOLD RUSH raced in mid pack early, went seven wide and never fired. THAT DOG WILL HUNT was void of speed, raced far wide and was
no factor.

Footnotes
COUNTRY ROAD raced in mid pack early, raced off the rail into the turn, angled out through the turn, was closing late and was up in time for the win. ALL
AMERICAN HERO pressed the early pace, went five wide into the turn, took control at the quarter pole, opened up, couldn't hold off the winner and just
miised. TOMAHAWK TUESDAY was void of any early speed, raced along the inside and offered a mild late rally. MIDNIGHT REVERIE was allowed to
settle early, raced six wide and finished belatedly. BLUE SKYE JADE set a pressured early pace, went four wide, drifted out and tired. WINGS OF THE
WIND was reserved early from between rivals and offered no rally. PASSED BY PAUL was unhurried early, raced seven wide and never fired.
