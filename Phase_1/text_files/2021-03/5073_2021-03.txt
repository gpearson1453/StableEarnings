Footnotes
KNOCKALITTLELOUDER showed good speed and set the pace, was challenged while in the two path on the turn, shook off a foe when asked for his best
in upper stretch, drew clear under the crop into the final seventy yards then was placed under a hand ride to the wire. CAN IMAGINE broke a half-step slow,
moved out at the rear of the field early, dropped in midway down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, checked when a foe crossed in front outside the
three-sixteenths, regained momentum outside the furlong marker, moved out while gaining into the final sixteenth and finished full of run to get the place.
CAJUN UP moved in midway down the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, drifted in a bit into the final
furlong and finished willingly for the show. RED HOT DEVIL chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, made a bid near the
five-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner outside the furlong marker and weakened. FRIENDLYPRODUCTION was taken in hand when a foe came out in
front near the five-eighths, settled off the pace, went four then five wide under urging on the turn, was carried seven wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. ROSE'S GALAXY broke a half-step slow, was bumped just inside the five-eighths, raced on the outside under urging, went four wide on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and retreated. DREW'S SHOT came out just inside the five-eighths and bumped with a rival, lugged out in the three path into
the turn, dropped to the two path then near the rail under heavy left-rein guidance on that bend, spun into the stretch in the two path, came in some and
bothered a foe outside the three-sixteenths and faltered.

Footnotes
DISTRACTOR FACTOR was hustled to the lead, went around the first turn in the two path, moved clear with five furlongs to run, dictated terms in the two
path through the far turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch and proved much the best under strong urging. AIR GUITAR STAR settled on the
inside, was roused on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch then moved further out, chased the winner under a drive while remaining on her inside
lead in the lane and was second best. FREDA'S SMOOTH AIR went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged along late on the
backstretch, rounded the far turn in the two path while ridden along, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while able to get
the show. ALLIACEOUS went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the back, raced off heels leaving the backstretch, was urged along while three wide
on the far turn and failed to rally. BELLAMY CAY angled in while showing speed, went around the first turn in the four path, dropped back off the pace with
five furlongs to run, was urged along in the three path on the far turn, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong then drifted out and tired. B'S
TEN went three then four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four wide on the far turn then driven six wide into the stretch
and came up empty. LONE STAR DIVA was last to commence, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled near the back, was urged five wide on
the far turn and failed to threaten. CRIMSON FELINE went four wide on the first turn, moved in at the rear of the field, raced inside to the two path on the far
turn and showed little. MILA'S GOLD went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged four then five wide on the far turn, came seven wide

Footnotes
MILITARY BEARING was well placed just off the pace in the two path, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, was roused late on that bend, made a bid
inside the leader in upper stretch, took the advantage into the final furlong then edged clear late under strong urging. IMMORTAL was hustled to the lead,
set the clear pace on the inside, was asked under threat on the far turn, lost the lead under a drive into the final furlong, battled with the winner into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the place. SMOKEY HARBOR rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused in the two
path on the far turn and lacked the needed response while up for the show. MAN ON THE MOON went four wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace on
the outside, was asked four wide on the far turn, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths, was carried five wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final
furlong and tired. ASSUMPTION went two to three wide on the turns, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ULTIMATE IRONY was last
away while breaking awkwardly, saved ground near the back of the field, shifted three wide into the stretch and was no factor. BIG NICK stumbled outward
at the start then bumped with a foe, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, tucked into the three path on the far turn, was roused near the
five-sixteenths then driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CANE CREEK ROAD went four to five wide under a tight hold on the
first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, was carried four wide into the stretch and
came up empty. PHRASEOLOGISM bumped with a foe at the start, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, raced five wide on the far turn,
floated seven wide into the stretch and showed little.

Footnotes
THEBOYZGALAXY was hustled to the lead, set the pace while near the inside, responded well when set down in upper stretch and drew off under strong
urging. DARLING JOANNA moved her head at the start and broke last but one, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, was
roused four wide on the far turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and was clearly second best. SINCERITY reared at the start and was off slow, spotted the
front a few lengths, went two to three wide on the turns, swung five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while just up for the show.
GRAND ISLE GIRL went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked three wide on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and
tired. EXPLOSIVELY HOT saved ground under restraint on the first turn, was rated just off the pace under a tight hold, drafted inside to the two path on the
far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. BREEZIN BYE YOU went four to five wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, dropped from
the three path to the rail on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then was put to a drive, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to
threaten. GATOR PROUD went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch
and failed to respond.
