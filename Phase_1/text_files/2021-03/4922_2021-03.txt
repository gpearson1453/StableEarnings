Footnotes
HORSE FLY showed good early speed to set all the pace along the inside and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. HOT BLOODED SONG
stalked the early pace, raced along the inside and finished second best. TRUE WEST was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide into the upper stretch
and made a good late gain. GREEN CARD was up close early on, raced three wide around the far turn and weakened a bit in the stretch. CASH MONEY
was allowed to settle early, saved ground and had not enough in the drive. KING OF ANYTHING was off slowly, raced four wide through the lane and never
was a serious threat. HYPER DRIVE was slow early, saved ground and never threatened. TED W dropped back early, raced six wide into the upper stretch
and never was a factor. NATTYTYME stalked the pace from the outside and tired. BANDWIDTH failed to sustain a bid.
