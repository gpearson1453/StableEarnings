Footnotes
CATHOLIC GUILT opened clear and angled in to control the tempo, widened into the stretch turn, turned back a mild bid leaving the quarter pole, and
stretched the advantage through the lane. MEGA MAX was forwardly placed three deep, failed to seriously threaten the winner, but churned on to earn the
runner op spot. EPIC ADVENTURE tracked toward the rail in hand, took his run at the leader midway through the second turn, but flattened during the drive.
MR. PETERKIN was unhurried into stride, settled near the tail of the field, launched a sweeping advance five wide through the far turn, loomed a danger
entering the stretch but failed to sustain the drive. SMACK ATTACK was keen into stride, settled saving ground under restraint, but lacked a response
thereafter. STUD PUPPY settled into stride, advanced between runners inside the three furlong marker, but faltered entering the lane and faded. TOIL AND
TROUBLE came away a bit slow and was never a factor.

Footnotes
RIVERBOAT GAMBLER attended the pace toward the inside, angled out for clear sailing leaving the turn, reeled in LOUDEN'S GRAY inside the furlong
marker and kicked away. BAQUERO FLIES was unhurried into stride, split rivals to commence his bid with three furlongs to run, continued the advance five
wide to the stretch, was unable to reach the winner but kept on well. FLASHYMEISTER was unhurried along the inside early, came under a ride on the
turn,. shifted out near the five-sixteenths marker and finished willingly between horses to earn the minor award. LOUDEN'S GRAY was within reach three
deep, launched a bold bid and drew even nearing the quarter pole, shook clear into the lane but flattened in the final furlong. BABADOOOK was close up
between rivals, came to level terns a quarter out, but weakened entering the stretch and faded. DEACON settled saving ground, got through and improved
position. STRATE REMARK sprinted clear to dictate terms, was collared nearing the quarter pole and gave way readily once headed. SPLASH FOR GOLD
showed little.

Footnotes
SEA TO SUCCESS vied four wide outside of foes early on, dueled outside of only FIRECRACKER STAND around the turn, took over from that foe passing
the five sixteenths pole, and drew off in upper stretch. GALILEE was off slowly, lied well off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path while
between horses entering the lane, hung on his left lead through midstretch before being bumped by an inner rival at the furlong pole, then stayed on
thereafter to secure place. AWESOME LAUNCH lied well off of the pace, swung to the five path in upper stretch, lugged in in midstretch when commencing
a rally, then sustained that kickv late to miss reaching place. MEGA CHARLIE lied off of the pace two to three wide around the turn, shifted to the four path
while outside of rivals in upper stretch, and ran on mildly. KHAKI JACK pressed three wide between horses early on, failed to keep pace with those rivals
approaching the half mile pole, saved ground tracking from midpack around the turn, then attempted to split foes in midstretch, but steadied in tight quarters
between horses when his inner counterpart when that foe drifted passing the furlong pole. PRESTO BENCH hopped at the start and was last away, lagged
behind, and was outrun. FIRECRACKER STAND dueled for the lead inside of a group of rivals early on, then only inside of the eventual winner around the
turn, but proved no match for that foe approaching the quarter pole, weakened in midstrech before drifting out into KHAKI JACK's path passing the furlong
pole, and subsequently faltered. TALKTOEACHOTHER vied three to two wide and from between horses early on, failed to keep pace before chasing those
rivals through the turn, and faded. NO CLASSIVA chased from midpack two wide around the turn, but was done early. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INTO THE START, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
SHACKADELIC stalked two wide while in hand, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, drew off in upper stretch, and safely held from a pair of pursuers through
the late stages. TONAL VISION tracked from midpack 3wd, advanced to striking range turning for home following SHACKADELIC's bid, then chased that
foe through the lane while fending off HASTAG WINNER for place. HASHTAG WINNER lied off of the pace along the inside, then two wide around the far
turn before swinging four wide at the quarter pole, sustained a late kick through the final furlong, but missed place. GLAMOUR GIRL stalked along the
inside, but faded turning for home. MISS MOON PIE set the pace along the inside, inched clear down the backstretch, held an advantage while meeting the
eventual winner's bid turning for home, but was headed by that foe in upper stretch, and weakened. MALIBU MARLEE lied far off of the pace along the
inside, took the far turn three to five wide, and never got involved. BETTER WITH AGE trailed, saved ground inside of foes around the far turn, but lacked a
rally through the lane.

Footnotes
AZTEC EMPIRE saved ground at the rear of the field, gained position inside of foes before smoothly splitting rivals three wide at the five sixteenths pole,
menaced outside of ENGLANDER turning for home, then kicked clear of that rival passing the furlong marker. ENGLANDER dueled along the inside, dug in
inside of AZTEC EMPIRE turning for home, but was bested by that foe at the furlong grounds, but stayed well clear of show to prove second best. TIZ THE
JOURNEY lied at the rear of the field two wide, paused behind traffic passing the quarter pole, shifted three wide while splitting foes in upper stretch, then
stayed on mildly to outfinish WICK for show. WICK saved ground from midpack altered course outside of POWER BURST in midstretch, bid for show inside
of TIZ THE JOURNEY, but was outfinished by that foe. POWER BURST stalked along the inside, but came under urging while getting outmoved by AZTEC
EMPIRE turning for home, then chased that foe through the lane before fading. UNIDENTIFIED MAN tracked from midpack two wide, then four to five wide
around the far turn, and failed to make an impact. CAPTAIN FANTASTIC pressed the pace three wide, came under urging to keep pace into the far turn, but
weakened at the five sixteenths pole. ACE GILFORD dueled for the lead two wide and from between horses early on, came under all out pressure at the
five sixteenths marker to keep pace with his inner counterpart, but weakened turning for home. SUPER WISE broke outwardly, lied off of the pace in the
four path around the first turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
WAR DETONATOR set the pace outside of foes, drew clear into the turn, showed the way in the three path around the bend, edged away from pursuing
rivals in upper stretch, and widened through the final furlong. HAYDENS HAVOC lied close up two wide and between horses, chased inside of WAR
DETONATOR through upper stretch, but failed to keep pace at the furlong grounds, tired through the late stages, but held place. SHANGHAI'S DREAM lied
far off of the pace in the three path, got floated to the five path turning for home outside of LOVE MY RIDE, then stayed on late to surpass outer foes in the
final sixteenth to achieve show. LAWLESSNESS chased from midpack in the three to four path around the turn, and failed to threaten. RISE UP REDHAWK
stalked three wide, chased outside of HAYDENS HAVOC through upper stretch, but tired through the final furlong, and faltered after flopping back to his left
lead at the sixteenth pole. LOVE MY RIDE stalked along the inside, appeared to bear out into and around the turn requiring strong left rein restraint, and
faltered around the bend. HARD TO PARK trailed throughout, and was outrun.

Footnotes
TRUMPET LILLY set the pace along the inside, vied inside of SMARMY around the far turn, shook clear from that foe in upper stretch, and held a measured
advantage from BOLD TACTICS approaching the wire. BOLD TACTICS trailed along the inside, advanced inside of foes to a stalking position into the ar
turn, shifted outside of the dueling leaders at the quarter pole, chased through the lane before sustaining his rally to attempt a late bid, but did not have
enough to catch the leader. SMARMY stalked two wide, vied outside of TRUMPET LILLY around the far turn, but was turned away by that rival in upper
stretch, and chased her home while getting outfinished for place. MISS TULSA lied forwardly placed three wide, failed to keep pace with the leaders while
caught four wide around the far turn, sustained chasing position turning for home, but faded in upper stretch. SALIT lied forwardly placed four wide, then
faltered three wide around the far turn. SEEKING HONOR tracked from midpack along the inside, then two wide and between horses into the backstretch,
steadied in tight quarters at the three furlong pole, and was protected thereafter.

Footnotes
JILTED BRIDE trailed, was patiently handled along the inside around the far turn, shifted four wide turning for home to split foes in upper stretch, bumped
with those rivals while doing so, surged to bid inside of ALTA'S AWARD approaching the wire, and prevailed over that foe. ALTA'S AWARD lied far off of the
pace two wide, swung six wide in upper stretch, and rallied outside of foes, but missed. W W FITZY lied forwardly placed in the four path around the first
turn, tugged forward to vie into the backstretch, showed the way while in the two path around the far turn, edged clear entering the lane, but tired in the final
furlong, and was bested approaching the wire. SINGITA DREAMS tracked from midpack three to four wide around both turns, but was bumped by an inner
foe while getting floated five wide in upper stretch, then got outkicked by rivals on both sides for minor rewards at the sixteenth pole. QUEEN BRIDGET
stalked along the inside, then two wide around the far turn before shifting to the three path turning for home, but faltered inside of rivals at the furlong
grounds. O SERAPHINA set the pace along the inside, vied inside of WW FITZY down the backstretch, but faded into the far turn. CHARMING LADY
stalked two to three wide, but faded turning for home, and was eased through the lane.

BRAVURA CREEK settled off the leaders early, advanced five-wide through the turn, responded to steady urging and wore down BOO BE RIGHT through
the closing yards. BOO BE RIGHT was away in good order to press the pace of TEN BUDS while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
three-eighths marker, remained in control through mid-stretch but could not match strides with the winner late. AFRICAN WARRIOR lacked early speed,
raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. MRS. BEANS was off a step slow, moved up quickly
for a contending position from the inside, steadied nearing the three-eighths marker, came back in the drive and finished with late interest.. YOUNG BULL
showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. TEN BUDS was hustled along to set a pressured pace from the inside and
gave way through the final furlong. EAST MOON LAKE raced off the pacesetters from between foes, moved from off the rail through the turn and lacked the
needed rally. SMELLIN CANDY was forwardly placed throughout, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually gave way. HAMAZING SONG broke
sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after the opening quarter. BANK MAN dwelt, raced five-wide through the turn and did not
reach contention. GOTTA LOVE IKE broke in the air, lagged, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY CONCERNING THE START AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGES.
