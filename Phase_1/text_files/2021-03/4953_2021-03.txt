Footnotes
AMERICAN GENTLEMAN retained the advantage after out-breaking the competition, cleared a fellow pace contestant and cut over to the rail nearing the
conclusion of the backstretch, found itself under two-fold pressure for a spell at the top of turn, flicked it off and then steadily extended the margin, settled in
upper stretch and was fed his cue, saw the runner up closing in dangerously in the late stages, held on long enough to prevail. REPO ROCKS away last
after shouldering the left side of the starting gate, travelled three to four wide on the turn, stepped into the lane, was just as wide launching its way into the
place slot. MAINE pursued the pace from the two path, was given his cue after sliding over to the rail at the five-sixteenths pole, cut the corner into the
stretch, proved no match. JAILBREAKER underwent a ground-saving journey, turned into the stretch and lacked the necessary response. CAMOUFLAGED
KISSER forwardly placed along the rail on the backstretch, contended for command from path two in between rivals during the initial stages of the run
around the bend, gave way. HIGH PRESS bobbled at the start, recovered and got guided into the three path, commenced the stretch one wider appearing
to have little left, readily retreated.

Footnotes
TEXAS BASIN chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home,
angled four wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to overhaul the front seventy yards from home, prevailed edging away to the finish. WRITER'S
REGRET hustled from the gate, raced briefly inside before tipping out four paths off the inside down the backstretch five and a half furlongs from home,
tucked three wide through the turn and steadily advanced on the front latching on with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in
head to head through the stretch taking command nearing the sixteenth marker, then got overhauled seventy yards from home and was along clear for the
place honors. MEETMEINCALI coaxed from the start, dueled from the two path with MR FANTASY to his outside, tucked inside half a mile from home and
shook off his main pace rival at the seven-sixteenths, got confronted at the five-sixteenths by the aforementioned foe, took the inside route into upper
stretch, dug in fending off that rival until collared near the sixteenth pole, then weakened in the late stages while safe for the show honors. KENTUCKY
COOL chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and made no late headway. RESPECT FOR ALL four
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper
stretch and weakened. MR FANTASY coaxed from the gate to the front, dueled from the three path with MEETMEINCALI to his inside, tucked to the two
path into the turn, got shaken off at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, tired and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
WAILIN JOSIE tracked the pace while spotted at a slight distance from off the rail, swung into the action by swinging three wide into the lane, responded
when given its cue, striking the front narrowly by the beginning of the last eighth, kept it going and kicked clear. STEAL MY HEART argued for command
from the two path, got put to the test by the winner in upper stretch, yielded, had enough left to salvage second with any difficulty. CHEATHAM HILL was
along for the show after undergoing a ground-saving journey. SHESASUPERFREAK underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, fanned out into path five
for the drive, missed out on third. SARATOGA BEAUTY four wide onto the turn, angled six wide for room during the stretch run, continuing along as the
widest of all, had no response. SKY KITTEN forwardly placed along the backstretch, departed it from the two path, showed some speed for a half and
folded.

HAPPY MEDIUM bumped at the start by HOMETOWN, who broke outwards, dueled from the four path with CLEMENZA to his inside, shook off that foe and
tucked inside half a mile from home and came under increasing pressure from the eventual winner to the outside, cut the corner into upper stretch, yielded
the front straightened away, dug in under a drive keeping on to preserve the show honors while well clear of the rest. RISK PROFILE four paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and
tired. CLEMENZA showed brief speed dueling from the three path to the inside of HAPPY MEDIUM, got shaken off nearing the half mile pole and tucked
inside in behind that rival now, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered. KID CASH got pinched
out between foes after the start, chased just off the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, angled four to five wide for home and folded.

Footnotes
MYSTIC NIGHT away in good order, raced three wide on the clubhouse bend, tucked along the rail and rode some cover from the top of the backstretch
until its conclusion, got gradually worked into the two path between the half mile pole and midpoint on the far turn, flashed interest prior to stepping onto the
head of the stretch, narrowed the gap, came out after being fed some left side stick work in midstretch, struck the front nonetheless and edged clear.
YANKEE DIVISION kept the advantage after breaking on top, cut over to the rail, rated well showing the way, with LOST IN ROME tagging along as the
primary pursuer much wider, began to shake off the aforementioned foe as three-quarters was being reeled off, settled in upper stretch and was called
upon, relinquished with approximately a sixteenth to go, finished far ahead of the rest for the place. AJAAWEED took the inside route until the end of the
second bend, was worked into path four from upper to midlane, finished well enough to be along for the show. LOST IN ROME forwardly placed three wide
early, stalked the pace from path two thereafter from the top of the backstretch until the three-eighths pole, gave way. BOLD AGENDA loosely pocketed, got
asked for more prior to reaching the quarter pole, was moved into the two path for the stretch run, backed away. MAGIC MICHAEL underwent a two wide
trip after lunging at the start, never made its presence felt.

Footnotes
MISTER BOBBY three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
through the final furlong knocking heads and taking command inside the sixteenth pole, dug in to prevail on the wire. BRILLIANT BROOKS chased along
the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch assuming command, edged away to the eighth pole, dug in
under threat and was collared inside the sixteenth marker, fought on inside to the finish. CAUSE OF ACTION chased just off the inside under a ride from the
three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to be along well clear for the show honors. TONKA FLOWER got coaxed along
briefly inside before tipping three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened.
MUCH TROUBLE coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and weakened, then
returned after the finish to outside the paddock and was subsequently vanned off. STEP TO THE BANK established the front and spurted away on the front
tipping four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three then two wide through the turn, came under threat near the quarter pole, went three wide
at that station and was overhauled straightened away for home, then tired through to the finish.

WUDDA U THINK NOW contended for the top towards the inside, edged away during the run around the turn, got turned loose for the drive, opened up his
largest advantage during the ensuing furlong, squandered some of it in deep stretch but held sway. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD tracked the winner from along
the inside route, tipped into the two path coming unto the head of the stretch, raced as a team with JUST RIGHT, bested that opponent for the place. JUST
RIGHT chased the pace two to three wide, was more the latter spinning into the lane, raced directly of VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD, fell short of snagging
second. MICROSCOPE three wide onto the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, gave way. NOT THAT BRADY at near the inside
route, brought up the back of the pack for the opening six furlongs, got steered to the outside entering the stretch, ventured six to seven wide down it without
making any headway. COLD HARD CASH at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, travelled four wide on the turn, angled into path five for
the drive, had no response. DANEBURY sparred for command to the outside of the winner for just over a half, folded.

Footnotes
EXCELLENT TIMING established the front and crossed to show the way in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled as the field got busy in behind
midway on the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, came under urging at the three-sixteenths, went clear to inside the eighth pole and was taken
in hand to prevail under his own power comfortably at the end. PERFECT MUNNINGS chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled four to five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on clear of the rest for the place honors. IT'S GRAVY chased just
off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and weakened while along for the show honors. IT'S A GAMBLE four wide in
pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. A LONGLONGTIMEAGO chased just off the inside
coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out six wide into upper stretch and tired. ECHOES OF DESTINY three then two wide in pursuit, got
coaxed along midway on the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. REGGAE MUSIC MAN leapt up just as the latch was sprung and was caught
in the hands of the starter getting away well behind and conceding a minimum ten lengths to the front, chased four then three wide detached at the tail of the
field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and was unable to make an impact. THE KING CHEEK three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, went four wide into upper stretch and folded. There was a Stewards' inquiry into the start focusing on REGGAE MUSIC
MAN. After review, it was determined that REGGAE MUSIC MAN was in the hands of the assistant starter when leaping up at the break. As a result, for
mutuel purposes only, REGGAE MUSIC MAN was declared a nonstarter before the race was declared official.

Footnotes
UP SEVENTYFOUR established the top on the backstretch, got set up at a slight distance from off the rail, showed the way, prompted by BASTET two to
three wide himself, saw the twosome get roused right around the three-sixteenths pole, dug in well to preserve the decision. BASTET prompted the winner
two to three wide, was put to a drive shortly after spinning into the lane, raced latched on to UP SEVENTYFOUR all the way down the lane, got staved off.
DESPEIGHT ALL ODDS tracked the pace from along the rail, was under a drive cutting the corner into the stretch, shifted out into path three during the next
sixteenth, proved no match. LEVELPLAYINGFIELD away a half length the tardiest, took up position in midpack, raced three wide on the turn, commenced
the stretch one path farther off the inside, lacked the necessary response. BECCA'S WISH chased the pacesetter two wide, gave way. LIGHTFOOT MISS
put to some encouragement from the get-go, remained stationed in the two path for the opening half, was moved to the outside for the drive until four to five
wide, made no headway. ROMA CARPE at or near the two path in pursuit of the front runners, had no offering. ODEMGOLDENSLIPPERS gently pinched
after the field had been sent off and running, cut over to the inside, went on to save ground to no avail. Please note ODEMGOLDENSLIPPERS raced with a
mask on.
