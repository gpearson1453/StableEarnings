Footnotes
MAMBA ON THREE was bumped at the start, advanced between foes down the backstretch, raced in range two wide around the turn, angled three wide
near the quarter pole, closed outside, seized command near the eighth pole, drew clear under hand urging, switched leads and shied in under right-handed
urging near the sixteenth pole and straightened out and widened under mild urging from there. LOYAL LOUIE dueled along the rail to the eighth pole, won
the duel but was unable to match strides with the winner in the final furlong. BEEBOO dueled outside of LOYAL LOUIE in the three path around most of the
turn, angled into the two path nearing the quarter pole, battled between to the eighth pole and weakened. BEACH WARRIOR stalked the pace four wide and
lacked a rally. ANDRES EDUARDO bobbled at the break, raced four wide and never threatened. THE KING AQUILES broke out and bumped the winner at
the start, saved ground and played no further factor. CAN'T BE BROKEN was outrun while racing three wide. MINDSHIP Q made little impact while racing
two wide.

Footnotes
ROMARIO set the early pace inside, shook off pursuers around the turn, and stayed clear all out. SURPRISE FACTOR chased four then three wide around
the turn, could not reach the winner but was clearly second best. CLAMOR showed brief speed before dropping off the first flight and moving inside, came
back out in upper stretch and went evenly to the finish. EMICRACK (CHI) broke a step slow, swung to the far outside for the drive and made no headway.
BLOODPROF pressed the early pace outside, and weakened after three furlongs. ONE TURN JOHNNY showed little at the back.

Footnotes
PULLING STRINGS set the pace in the two path and drew off under a steady drive. HAPPY INTEREST brushed with FACTS ONLY at the start, prompted
the winner three wide, could not keep pace with that foe nearing the lane but stayed on to be clearly second best. SWEET PENELOPE tracked the pace
four wide, lacked a rally and held third. PEACHY QUEEN chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. FACTS ONLY brushed at the start, saved ground
and played no factor. RUBYSA had some speed two wide between foes, dropped back around the turn, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole and
continued to fade. ASPROPODIA was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. GOLDEN TRINNI was bumped at the start and outrun
while racing four and five wide.

Footnotes
NACO pressed DREAM OF WARRIOR from outside, took over entering the stretch, and was driving to remain clear. ALADO brushed the right side of the
gate coming out, tracked the leaders in the clear three wide to the stretch, and finished willingly to best the others. HIGH YIELD KITTEN was outsprinted
two to three wide to the stretch, and was up late between horses in the show scramble. TIZ A PRINCE became edgy waiting to be loaded, broke a step
slow, raced four wide around the turn at the back, and improved mildly on the far outside. DREAM OF WARRIOR set the early pace hounded by the
eventual winner, and gave way into the lane. ROYAL WAR saved ground in range to the stretch, and faded. BULK brushed the left side of the gate coming
out, came under a ride on the turn inside and had no response.

SIMPLE STORY broke outwardly, raced off the pace inside, tipped two wide near the three-sixteenths pole, moved to the front leaving the eighth pole and
widened while ridden out. DANCING DESTROYER set the pace along the rail, led past the eighth pole, was no match for the winner but held well clear of
the rest. QUEEN ABARRIO was pinched back at the start, raced four wide and was along for the show. NOMBRE prompted the pace two wide, drifted out
turning for home and tired. FREEZER BURN chased the pace three wide between foes and came up empty in the lane. TOO STYLISH popped open the
starting gate prior to the start but never escaped the grasp of the assistant starter then refused to break when the race actually started. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND TOOK NO ACTION.

FREE TO FLY was taken off the inside midway up the backstretch, advanced approaching the stretch while shifting out to the five-path, wrested command
outside SUBSIDIARY entering the final furlong and drove clear. SUBSIDIARY pressed LIZA STAR from outside, held a narrow advantage from the
quarter-pole to mid stretch, could not handle the winner from there and ran on second best. LIZA STAR set a pressured early pace, and yielded on the rail
through the furlong grounds. DOMINEER raced forwardly toward the inside entering the turn, then faded gradually while shifting out four wide near the
quarter-pole. TREVESS was finished early outside.

BASELINE DRIVE raced off the early pace two wide, was roused four wide near the three-eighths pole, closed outside, seized command nearing the eighth
pole and drew off under a drive. BALLYMORE STAR (IRE) saved ground in range, tipped out in upper stretch and finished willingly to gain the place. LOOK
ME OVER set the pace along the rail and weakened through the final furlong. BONKERS saved ground off the pace, raced two wide between rounding the
far turn, had the rider lose the left iron near the three-sixteenths pole, regained it near the eighth pole, angled out and improved position. MINT EDITION
was very reluctant to load, stalked the pace two wide in the clear and came up empty in the lane. ESKIMO'S BOSS broke a bit awkwardly, saved ground
and never threatened. ALL'S FAIR played no factor while racing two wide. AWESOME ELLA chased the pace two and three wide and retreated through the
stretch.

Footnotes
MISSING LINK hustled through on the rail to put a head in front of SHE'S CLASSY approaching the turn, outdueled that rival shaking clear once
straightened away for the drive, and held for the decision. VERY SAVVY raced in the two-path around the turn, shifted out further in the stretch and finished
well to get up for second. SHE'S CLASSY broke to the lead, vied outside MISSING LINK around the turn, yielded through upper stretch and was overhauled
for the place. BEAUTY QUEEN came in and bumped PINK FIZZ shortly after the start, was on hold entering the turn near the inside, moved out in the
stretch and improved for a share without threatening. SPEEDY FIRE saved ground throughout, and made no progress through the lane. PITUFINA broke
slowly and was outrun three wide. PINK FIZZ absorbed a solid bump from BEAUTY QUEEN and steadied back soon after the start, got taken out four wide
on the turn and remained in arrears.

Footnotes
PATTY H set the pace along the rail, drifted out under right-handed urging in the lane and held firm. TO A T tracked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide
near the quarter pole and finished well outside of the winner to narrow the gap. SWEET BABY RAELYNN raced off the pace outside, was carried out six
wide nearing the three-eighths pole, angled back down to the four path leaving that marker and was one-paced in the lane. EMUNAH failed to menace while
racing three and four wide. KHOZZY VALINTINE broke a bit awkwardly, raced well back two wide, swung widest in upper stretch and never threatened.
GONE TO CABO was outrun while racing two wide. BRIELLA pressed the winner two wide, faltered nearing the lane and was eased. SNACKSTER got out
entering the turn, was pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
SHORT CIRCUIT saved ground unhurried early in the middle of the pack, maneuvered out picking up horses rapidly three wide after six furlongs, forged to
the front outside ZAFFING in upper stretch and drove clear. FAMILY TIME went along covered up inside to the far turn, moved out three wide into the
stretch, and finished willingly. IRAZU ran up behind horses into the first turn having to be checked sharply, continued to steady along until straightening into
the backstretch, advanced a bit inside entering the far turn, moved out three wide past the quarter-pole and finished with good courage. ZAFFING pressed
LADY TAPATIA from outside, reached a short lead between that one and SHORT CIRCUIT approaching the top of the stretch, could not withstand the latter
soon after that and gave way through the last eighth of a mile. IRIS THE EMPRESS raced two to three wide, and failed to respond when asked on the far
turn. IN A SPIN broke slowly, and was no factor while three to four wide throughout. POISON IVY was no factor toward the inside. LADY TAPATIA set a
manageable pace inside for six furlongs, and folded up into the stretch. MISS AMENDMENT was finished after six furlongs while four wide. MA REVE was
finished after six furlongs while three wide.
