Footnotes
SAMURAI FIGHTER never far back, inside run to quarter pole, took over and clear. KIKI'S LULU ROSE unhurried with rail run quarter pole, rallied all out for
place. KITTENAIRE set pace to deep stretch, weakened late holding the show spot. SUNFLOWER ROAD no speed for three quarters, improved position
inside late. EIDA'S STORM raced evenly throughout, no late response when needed. JOYFUL PRAISE pinched back start losing best chance, trailed to the
stretch and only passed tiring rivals. CLASS RIOT tracked outside for three quarters, flattened out in the stretch. STEPPINPERFECTION chased outside to
far turn, could not go on and faded in stretch. SPECIAL BLUE chased inside to the half, gave way readily thereafter.

P H FACTOR quickly to the lead, set all pace well rationed while well clear. CAN'T HIDE FROM ME unhurried early, rallied far turn while no match for the
entry mate. DIRECT APPROACH trailed to far turn, rallied quarter pole, along for third. MALIGATOR never far back to far turn, flattened out in through after
half. RAYO DE LUZ chased outside to the half, stayed close three quarters, wilted. GLADTOBEHERE well placed never far back outside to far turn, used
up, gave way. KICHIRO had a tardy start, never threatened thereafter. STRONG YEN tracked inside to far turn used up, gave way with mild resistance.

FLOROPLUS inside chase to turn, took over and went clear impressively. DR. FORMAN tracked three widest to the turn, proved no match for winner.
SECRETARY AT WAR dueled two path, stayed on well just missing the place spot. KATE'S GOLDEN DUDE bothered back start, rushed to turn, rallied
widest into stretch. TESTY KITTEN emptied out early while racing inside throughout. THIRSTY BETRAYAL never factored. TAP THE MOJO through at the
half dropped back readily. UNCLE EARL dueled inside to the turn but surrendered quickly in stretch. JOHNNY CAB never menaced. PER RULING 21-0033
FROM THE KENTUCKY HORSE RACING COMMISSION, FLOROPLUS WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
