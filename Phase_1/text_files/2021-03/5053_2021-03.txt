Footnotes
SECOND GUESS lagged behind the field early on, rallied four wide around the far turn, ranged up to a trio of inner foes in midstretch, forged an advantage
while hanging on his left lead under a long drive at the sixteenth pole, and edged clear. LORD STRATTON vied along the inside through the first turn, took
back to stalk from the pocket into the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn before producing a rail bid at the furlong grounds, but was outfinished by
an outer rallying foe late. JOHN ALLEN stalked three wide around the first turn, prompted the pace two wide around the far turn before being floated three
wide again in upper stretch, then was outkicked by an outer foe and an inner rival through the final furlong. LINDANTE set the pace outside of a rival around
the first turn, cleared that foe into the backstretch, showed the way inside of foes around the far turn, shifted off of the rail in upper stretch, then faltered
between horses at the sixteenth pole. PROPER DECORUM settled off of the pace along the inside around the first turn, advanced to stalking range outside
of a pair of foes into the far turn, but lacked a kick through the lane to produce a bid, and failed to factor. THE QUARTER MILE FRACTION IS
UNAVAILABLE.

PRETTY BRITCHES cleared early on, dug in inside of a bidding SWEET MARY M turning for home, re-edged a clear advantage in upper stretch, and held
clear while hanging on his left lead. SWEET MARY M brushed an inner foe at the start, chased the clear leader two wide, inched closer turning for home to
make a bid entering the lane, but failed to match strides with the leader in upper stretch, and failed to have enough to catch that foe late. DICEY got pinched
and bobbled between horses early on causing her to trail, improved inside of foes into the turn, chased the leaders around the bend, then failed to keep
pace with those foes through the lane, but saved show. YAK ATTACK was brushed by an outer foe at the start, lied off of the pace three to four wide around
the turn, and failed to reach show while not threatening the winner. GIRLS A BULLET put DICEY in tight quarters while shifting outside of rivals down the
backstretch, chased from off of the pace four to three wide around the turn, but faded through the lane. I THINK I GOT THIS lied forwardly placed through
the opening furlong, but was done early. THE QUARTER MILE FRACTION IS UNAVAILABLE.

then held sway from that foe to the wire. SCYNTZ tracked from midpack two to three wide, rallied turning for home to bid for the lead in upper stretch, but
hung on his let lead, was repelled passing the furlong marker, and chased his inner counterpart home. ZYZACK set the pace in the two path around the first

SHEZALITTLEHAZEY stalked the leading duelers from the to to three path around the turn, bid for the lead outside of LANDRY KYLE in upper stretch, then
edged away from that foe through the late stages. LANDRY KYLE tracked from midpack along the inside, bid for the lead inside three wide and between
horses in upper stretch, but was out-edged by her outer bidding counterpart in the late. MISS COFFEYVILLE dueled for the lead outside of GODDESS OF
WONDER, then gave way to outer foes in midstretch, and tired, but saved show. SATURDAY SERVICE lied off of the pace two to three wide, came into the
lane five wide, but lacked a rally, failed to factor, and missed catching a tiring foe for show. GODDESS OF WONDER dueled for the lead inside of MISS
COFFEYVILLE, got headed by a trio of rivals in upper stretch, and weakened at the furlong grounds. DUMAANI'S BABY was outrun. THE QUARTER MILE

Footnotes
CALCULATING KING lied off of the pace five wide, rallied turning for home to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, then drove clear through the final furlong.
TROY OUNCE prompted the pace three wide, dug in inside of the bidding CALCULATING KING in upper stretch, but yielded to that foe approaching the
final sixteenth, then just held place from an inner gaining rival. RIVER RULER stalked along the inside, split foes turning for home, chased inside of the
leaders through the lane, then missed catching an outer foe for place. SHIPMAN'S SONG was off slowly, lied off of the pace two wide and between horses,
shifted four wide in upper stretch, then six wide in midstretch, and stayed on. FRESH ONE tracked from midpack four wide, but was outkicked by an outer
foe in upper stretch, and tired. ONOMATOPOEIA trailed, lied off of the pace in the six path around the turn, and failed to factor. AGENT MCGEE vied for the
lead two wide and between horses, but faded at the quarter pole. BURTNJOE vied along the inside, but faded with five sixteenths to go. COVINGTON
QUALITY was no factor. Due to a timer malfunction the opening quarter time is unavailable.
