Footnotes
THORN OF ROSE HILL settled off the early pace inside then eased out entering the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far
turn three wide, lugged in under right hand urging mid-stretch and took over later yards. ANOTHER MOVE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure
leaving the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, lugged in across the path of ALLOVERBUTTHECRYIN under a right hand drive
mid-stretch, then flattened stride later yards, while the latter, rated close toward the inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far
turn and took aim inside through the upper stretch, but was shut off and had to check off the heels of Another Move mid-stretch and couldn't recover stride.
COCKY WINCHILL stalked off the rail then picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, faded into the far turn then bore out through the turn.
ROCKET COLONY came away a bit awkwardly and settled close about the three path into the backstretch, showed little response and was carried wide on
the far turn. A Stewards inquiry, resulted in the disqualification of Another Move to third place for lugging across the path of Alloverbutthecryin leaving the
sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
BRIBERY settled back in the three path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and came through the far turn about the five path, closed to the
front in later yards and drew off nearing the wire. SUNBRIDLED angled in across the paths of Boundtobegood and Mega Millions past the three quarter pole
and stalked two deep, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and dueled between horses from that point, dropped back into the far turn but dug in to
take second later yards while yielding to the winner. BYEBYE BYEBYE rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and
dueled clear on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement, but was caught flattening stride later yards. MEGA MILLIONS was shut off
checking off the heels of Sunbridled past the three quarter pole then settled off the pace toward the inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths, raced
at the rail on the far turn then flattened down the lane. BOUNDTOBEGOOD was shut off checking at the heels of Sunbridled past the three quarter pole then
stalked into the backstretch, challenged three wide from the seven sixteenths and gave chase through the backstretch, but dropped back into the far turn
and weakened toward the head of the lane. G MAN raced well back. A Stewards inquiry resulted in the disqualification of Sunbridled to fifth place for angling
in across the paths of Boundtobegood and Mega Millions past the three quarter pole.

EASY'S FINAL ROSE raced with the early pace then rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
near the rail and dug in under an all out drive to hold off the late arrival of MOLLY BOLTS, who raced well back from early contention then eased out with a
bid into the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the three path, dug in leaving the turn and was gaining steadily on the winner. BOTTLE COURAGE settled
off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, then flattened stride. KATIE FALOONA saved
ground off the pace, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn but showed little further. CHERISH YOUR DREAM
stalked three wide most of the front stretch then saved ground into the second turn and faded through the backstretch. HALF EMPTY steadied early then
came between horses to take a brief slim lead nearing the seven eighths pole, stalked shortly afterward then faded leaving the seven sixteenths pole.

out entering the stretch but dug in gamely to the finish. K W CAPTAIN FLINT rounded the opening turn about the three path then stalked into the
backstretch, bid from the three eighths pole and raced in range of the lead in the three path of the turn, but flattened stride leaving the turn. BIG BOOTS
