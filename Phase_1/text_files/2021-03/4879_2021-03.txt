DO I EVER stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, was put to a drive and drew off.
NIKKI'S DREAM , up close down the backstretch, circled the turn three wide, took aim on the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. DIVA OF SEVILLE ,
right to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and gave way in upper stretch. GRAND ENTRADA , outrun to the stretch, swung to the three path in upper
stretch and passed tired foes. CHELICHNA hugged the inner rail around the turn and was never a factor. BELL THE CAT raced in the two path on the turn
and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
BAHAMA CHANNEL prompted the pace outside HOLY SAINT, sparred on near even terms from the five eighths, was caught between rivals battling from
the five sixteenths to mid stretch, saw BLUE SKY PAINTER edge away slightly soon after, battled back while solidly hand ridden in the final sixteenth and
just got up inside runners. BLUE SKY PAINTER , well placed tracking the contested pace, bid three deep when called upon near the five sixteenths, dueled
and moved to a slim lead in upper stretch, remained on top in the skirmish past the furlong grounds, kept on valiantly to the line but was edged in the final
jumps. TITAN'S WILL , off a bit slow after bobbling, regrouped and angled out when advancing past the seven furlong marker, took closer order four wide
into the far turn, did not initially kick in when put to a strong ride past the five sixteenths, gathered steam past the eighth pole, shifted out some late and
finished well to gain. HOLY SAINT took a short lead early and secured the inside, was joined by the winner mid way around the first turn, disputed the front
end with that one from the three quarter pole, battled inside a pair of runner from the five sixteenths to mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. RUNNER
RUNNER INDY saved ground while well within range of the leaders, came under pressure leaving the far turn but failed to kick on. FIND YOUR BOAZ
lagged off the pace, swung six wide into the lane but failed to threaten.

BEAN INDISCREET sprinted to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail and pulled away through the stretch while ridden out. SUNDAY IN L B C , in
the two path between horses leaving the turn, chased the winner through the stretch and was second best. SEVILLA SANGRIA saved ground around the
turn, failed to rally and was taken to the three path near the eighth pole. THEA'S THEME lacked speed, swung to the four path in upper stretch and was not
a factor. HICKORY MADE , along the inner rail around the turn and through the stretch, was outrun. WHAT A TART , three deep leaving the turn, was
outrun. MS. HAITI , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened through the stretch.

START THE PARADE bobbled at the break, recovered and attended the pace three deep, battled past the five sixteenths, shook clear into the lane widened
then drifted in under a solid drive in mid stretch then held sway while under steady hand urging late. REPLICANT stalked the leaders four wide, was under
urging mid turn, saw the winner get away in upper stretch but kept on with interest to the wire. MAGIC MULE vied between rivals, put a head in front into the
far turn, continued a pace presence to the head of the lane then weakened through the final furlong. APERITIVO gained command inside rivals early on, set
a pressured pace, ceded the lead into the turn, failed to keep pace while under a drive past the quarter pole and gave way. TRACER saved ground,
remained in touch for about a half mile then retreated.

PRINCESS COREY prompted the pace three wide around the turn, secured command turning for home, opened a clear advantage under urging in mid
stretch then held sway. HUFFLEPUFF bore out leaving the starting gate, chased the pace four deep around the turn and finished gamely. CASTILLEJA ,
two wide on the turn, angled to the three path turning for home and had a slight rally between rivals. DEVILISH AFFAIR , four deep on the turn, floated to
the six path in upper stretch and passed tired horses. MAKE IT A DOUBLE hugged the inner rail and chased the early pace. OUR SWEET GIRL set a
pressured pace in the two path around the turn and gave way in the drive.

KING MAURO took over leaving the chute then edged clear in the opening quarter mile, set a rated pace towards the rail, responded when set down
entering the lane, widened under a stout drive past mid stretch, continued on eagerly and was under steady hand asking through the final sixteenth.
BRUTUS stalked the winner two wide, was put to strong urging nearing the lane, gave hard chase past the furlong grounds and kept on with good energy
though no match for the winner. THEY SHOT SONNY stalked three wide, circled four wide while under a drive into the lane but lacked a serious response.
SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR rated three wide early, edged up between foes near the five eighths, came under a ride mid turn, failed to kick in and faded through
the lane. THE QUANTICO KID saved ground and faded. BIG BOOTS , off the pace while saving some ground into the turn, failed to respond. EMPTY
NESTR was outrun.

TAYLER'S CHROME , sent to the early lead, set the pace near the rail, opened up under urging in mid stretch and prevailed under steady handling.
PROMISE THE WORLD stalked the pace outside rivals, raced three wide on the far turn and rallied. ENTER SANDWOMAN , fractious in the starting gate,
raced inside horses, chased the pace for six furlongs then faded. WONDERWALL lacked speed, circled the far turn four deep and failed to be a factor.
GUNS BLAZING prompted the pace outside the winner and gave way. GRAVITY'S RAINBOW chased the early pace, unseated her rider when sustaining a
catastrophic injury entering the backstretch and was euthanized.

Footnotes
VILLAMOURA sped clear early, set the pace under a light hold and to the inside, was guided three wide into the lane, kept on under right handed rousing
past mid stretch then had enough left to hold on. ADABEL , between rivals early, advanced three wide into the lane, shifted out a bit wider and closed
steadily to gain. SUZZETTE STAR , four wide, edged up under urging into the lane then churned on to wire. FAMILY FORTUNE dropped in nearing the
turn, was under pressure pursuing into the lane but lacked a bid. TOMA drafted back off the early pace, angled out into the lane but failed to muster up a
legitimate kick. BODES SUNSET was shuffled back nearing the half mile marker, dropped back to last, swung wide into the lane but failed to seriously
recover. LOOKIN FOR CANDY rushed up four wide early, chased between foes into the turn, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths and gave way.
