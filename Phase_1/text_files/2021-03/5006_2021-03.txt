between rivals on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and continued to press rival, no match for winner in the stretch but kept on well to hold show.
REMEMBER TO BID came in at the start three paths, contested pace three wide on the backstretch, entered turn three wide, entered stretch in the four
path and kept to task in an even finish. LINDATHEBOOKKEEPER broke in and bumped rival at the start, tracked leaders two wide on the backstretch,
