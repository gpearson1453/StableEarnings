CHAMPERS led inside under a rating hold, moved clear on the turn then widened late under moderate pressure. BUNDI BUNDI pressed the winner from
the outside and continued gamely while no match in the stretch. STRICTLY THE BEST lacked speed, advanced inside on the turn, swung wide in the
stretch rallying. SPACEMAN saved ground off the pace, moved wide on the turn and faded. COURT SKY broke very slowly and raced far back then showed
some late energy. BRONXVILLE dropped back early, bid inside on the turn then faltered. GREEN GROWTH bobbled slightly while breaking alertly, was
urged close up then stopped.

LEGAL GUMP set the pace on the inside, dueled with BILL'S MAFIA nearing the far turn, dug in gamely between rivals entering the stretch, battled on
determinedly in the stretch run and edged away late to prevail. BILL'S MAFIA pressed the pace racing close up outside, bid two wide, dueled with the
winner on the far turn, dug in gamely in stretch drive and earned the place award. KNOKKE BY THE SEA raced three wide on the first turn, stalked outside,
bid four wide at the quarter pole, dueled and dug in gamely outside to the finish. DRUMMOND tracked along the inside, made a rail bid at the quarter pole,
dueled in upper stretch and was outkicked. SACRIFICING IT ALL raced off the pace between rivals and failed to rally. MAYNOOTH raced off the pace, had
an inside trip and failed to threaten. MAMAIGOTTHIS raced four wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. REDNECK COWBOY was
outrun.

MISS STAR LO pursued the loose pacesetter inside, angled out in the lane and edged away under a drive. LA PURISSIMA quickly sprinted clear inside,
shortened stride in the stretch but lasted for the place. PRINCESS ARENI chased outside and continued willingly while no threat. PROSPECTIVE BELLE
lacked speed, advanced inside then flattened out late. I'M THIRSTY raced outside in closest pursuit of the pacesetter then faltered. WHAT ABOUT
TONIGHT trailed early outside, continued wide and was no factor. ATLANTIC AVENUE dropped back inside and gave way. LIVIN A DREAM chased inside
and began faltering on the turn.

gamely. COBH chased wide to the stretch and picked off rivals late. PSYCHIC ENERGY raced within striking range inside, angled out in the stretch but
flattened. INKY DINKY DO prompted the pace wide and gradually weakened. MANAHAWKIN dropped well behind inside and lacked a rally. FIFTY dropped
