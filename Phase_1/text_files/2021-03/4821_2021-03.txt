process of being gathered up through the final yards, and was vanned off after the finish. HANGAR ONE bumped with DROPPED ANCHOR at the start,
raced forwardly three then two wide for five furlongs, and tired. THIS DUDES NO FOOL broke in bumping PERUVIAN DANCER into EXXTOP at the start,

Footnotes
BIG BLUE settled off the pace while racing two wide, cruised up three wide around the far turn, steadily gained through the lane, switched back to the left
lead nearing the sixteenth pole and was up late. CITY MAGIC set the pace along the rail, shrugged off a bid from NAVAJO CREED turning for home,
re-cleared in upper stretch, fought on inside the winner and led until deep stretch. NAVAJO CREED stalked the pace two wide, bid nearing the lane,
reached near even terms near the quarter pole, was turned back in upper stretch but stayed on to hold third. SETTE STELLE saved ground up close and
lacked a rally. EL TABERNERO ONE was in range two and three wide and lacked a closing bid. NOW A JAGUAR failed to menace while racing three wide.
CONGRATS AGAIN hit the starting gate, saved ground well back, swung out in upper stretch and had no response. WILLIAM BOY was outrun inside.
UNDER FIRE fought rating through the opening the quarter and played no factor while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
TEN PIN ALLY moved in from the two-path coming up behind the leaders around the turn, was prevented from going further out by ELLIEREESEASTON at
the top of the stretch, rallied through on the rail and took over from YELLOWSTONE GIRL coming to the eighth-pole, and drew clear under pressure.
ELLIEREESEASTON prompted the pace in the three-path, was under a drive outside YELLOWSTONE GIRL while keeping TEN PIN ALLY bottled up near
the three-sixteenths, could not kick with the latter through mid stretch, and was up late for second. YELLOWSTONE GIRL set the pace slightly removed
from the inside, got overhauled from her left flank by the winner with a furlong remaining, then lost the place near the finish. BABY LION raced close up for
six furlongs, and weakened through the stretch while drifting out. COFFEE BUZZ BUZZ showed early speed three wide, had nothing left around the turn,
and jogged in. FEARLESS IDEAS veered in sharply leaving the chute, struck and leapt the temporary rail unseating the rider, completed the course and
was apprehended and escorted off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT LEAVING THE CHUTE BEFORE THE RESULT WAS
MADE OFFICIAL. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

CALABASH set the pace in the two path, shrugged off challenges near the quarter pole and widened under a drive. MUTAKAAMIL was in range inside, bid
inside of the winner nearing the eighth pole but was no match for the that foe in the final furlong. RED FLAG ALERT tracked the pace two wide, bid three
wide nearing the lane and was one-paced through the stretch. JEALOUS EYES saved ground in midpack and never threatened. BIG PERM stalked the
winner in the three path and faded in the lane. VIKING PLUNDER raced well back two wide, steadied near the five-sixteenths pole, angled out soon after
and never threatened. MIGHTY TOUGH played no factor while racing two wide. FINDING MISCHIEF failed to menace while racing three wide.

Footnotes
WELL SHES HANDSOME broke inward, set the pace inside, shook off pursuers into the stretch, drifted out late from left-handed pressure and had enough
to preserve the decision. PRETZEL was close up between horses before taking back off the early leaders, went around four wide with a bid approaching the
stretch, finished gamely outside the winner but did not have enough. PULLING STRINGS broke inward, pressed the pace between horses, weakened in the
stretch and stayed clear for the show. FIOR DI LATTE pressed the pace three wide, and gave way into the lane. CORINTHIA broke inward, and had no
rally. MAVI was always outrun. COTTONS LAST shied in from inward-breaking rivals and steadied at the start, and was always far back.

DUNDALK set the pace along the rail, dug in gamely inside of STREET COPPER and held firm. STREET COPPER stalked the winner two wide, bid nearing
the lane, battled on outside throughout the stretch but was held at bay. SECOND MATE raced two wide in midapck to upper stretch and had a mild rally
between. MONONGAHELA settled off the early pace inside, advanced outside down the backstretch, perched three wide off the top two rounding the far
turn but was one-paced in the lane. SALUTE THE COLONEL raced off the pace two wide, checked when pulling late on the first turn, continued two wide
and never threatened. HONEY WON'T saved ground to no avail. FREEDOM'S FLIGHT was in a bit tight at the start, raced three wide and made little
impact. RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH NO FRACTIONS AVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ALEJANDRO'S TEAM saved ground in range to the far turn, moved out four wide rallying at the top of the stretch, caught EXCALIBUR from outside and
drew clear late. EXCALIBUR settled in the second flight early, advanced to contention three wide entering the far turn, took over outside NIMBLE BEAST
after six furlongs, could not deny the winner in the stretch but was clearly second best. RANGER UP raced three to four wide throughout, and was up
outside NIMBLE BEAST to get the show. NIMBLE BEAST sprinted clear and moved inside around the first turn, got overhauled approaching the stretch,
and weakened on the rail. ONE EYED JACK bumped lightly with PROSPECT PROJECT at the start, lodged a bid two wide on the far turn, but gave way in
upper stretch. SUPER EDGAR was no factor two to three wide. PROSPECT PROJECT bumped lightly with ONE EYED JACK at the start, and never
reached contention. NINETYDAYSOFWINTER raced three to four wide, gained mildly after six furlongs, but could not sustain the bid. RIGGINS was always
far back. TIZ LIGHT THE WAY was never prominent.

Footnotes
WHAT'S INSIDE broke awkwardly spotting the field two lengths, raced two wide in the second flight to the end of the turn, moved out for the drive, stayed on
his left lead and responded to get up in the closing strides. EARTH set the pace inside, dug in stubbornly through the stretch and was nailed near the wire.
DUGOUT pressed EARTH from outside all the way, and stayed on willingly. MARCELINO raced four to five wide around the turn, stayed on well and gained
late between horses. GRAN MALBEC was outsprinted to the quarter-pole three wide, moved to the far outside and improved position. SEVEN GEMS raced
close up inside to the stretch, and was outfinished. FRENCHMEN STREET saved ground throughout, gained into the stretch, but was outkicked through the
last eighth of a mile. DISCRETIONARY MARQ bumped with KALU at the start, was outrun to the stretch, and gained without threatening. KALU bumped
with DISCRETIONARY MARQ at the start, raced two wide around the turn, and was outfinished. TENACITY ZIP was squeezed back between horses and
checked sharply at the start, and never reached contention. FIXED POINT tracked outside the leaders three wide, and faltered into the stretch.
