Footnotes
BOISTEROUS RASCAL was outrun early, found room between rivals out of the turn, was gaining, took control late stretch and edged clear for the win.
NEWELL was void of speed, advanced along the inside, passed rivals through the stretch and finished second best. FRANKS DEHERE tracked the early
pace, raced five wide through the turn, was empty late and held for third. UNCONSCIOUS POWER set a pressured pace, raced off the rail into the turn and
weakened. ROUGE SUNSET pressed the early pace, went four wide and faded. BROTHER BEAUCHAMP was taken back early, raced eight wide and
never fired. APPEALINGLY EASY raced in mid pack early, went six wide and flattened out. TORCH was unhurried early, raced five wide into the turn and
offered no late rally.

AIDAN'S HARBOR was up close early, raced six wide into the turn, took control at the quarter pole, drifted in and edged clear for the win. ARUGULA
pressed the early pace, was eased back through the turn, raced between rivals out of the turn, passed rivals through the stretch, was no match and finished
second best. BABY SHAMU set a pressured early pace, raced five wide into the turn, was forced in by the winner and weakened late. THE KOHEN was
void of speed, went four wide into the turn, angled in and offered no late rally. FLICKERING LIGHT was outrun early, raced seven wide through the turn and
never fired. SOUTH FRESNO stalked the early pace, went three wide and faded. LOTTA GUSTO raced in mid pack early, circled eight wide and flattened
out. SHARK HARBOR chased the early pace and retreated.
