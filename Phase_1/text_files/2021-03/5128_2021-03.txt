Footnotes
SCARLET POSITION with the pace from the start outside, dueled through the turn, steadily drew clear through the stretch while being kept to pressure.
FRENCH ROSE in the second flight while racing three wide, bit closer turning for home, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, enough left to last
for the place. J P'S GLADYS off a step slow, trailed for much of the way, came four wide into the stretch, finished with good energy while widest to the lane
to be getting to the runner up late. IMAGINARY MUSIC broke on top, behind the early pace inside, moved off the rail a bit in the turn, two path into the lane,
went evenly in lacking a late kick. SWEET TATUM back off the early pace, moved up to the second flight into the turn, four wide through the bend, lacked a
closing kick. FRILLS dueled up front inside the winner for a half and gave way.

Footnotes
MILLARD'S COMET off pace along the inside, continued to save ground into the lane, rail bid, gained command inside the furlong marker, just enough to
hold off the runner up late. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED broke back, steadied behind horses early in the turn, two path into the stretch when in some traffic,
altered course sharply to the outside for room when straightened for home, finished with good energy while steadily drifting in to narrowly miss. LITTLE
SURE SHOT forwardly placed while racing three wide, continued on the outside for the drive, took over nearing the furlong marker, proved no match for the
top two late, saved the show. FREEDOM BOUND broke back, raced four wide into the turn, three wide into the lane, went evenly through the stretch.
WINNING MANDATE dueled up front while closest to the inside for over a half, weakened in the drive. O K BABY in the two path just off the inside,
retreated through the stretch. LEN'S GOLD broke alertly, dueled in the two path, stopped in the drive while shortening stride, eased, walked off.

Footnotes
TAPALONG with the pace while between horses in the run up the backstretch, dueled through the turn while remaining in the two path, shook well clear,
ridden out. COLLUDE broke slowly, lacked early foot while just off the inside, advance in the two path, up late for the place, no threat to the winner.
DIXIELAND DREAM vied up front while racing three wide, dueled through the turn outside the winner, could not match the winner in the drive, weakened a
bit and was caught late for the place, clear of the others. WHOVILLE behind the first flight outside, four wide through the turn, continued one paced through
the lane in lacking a closing response. IKE LIKES one paced while well wide up the backstretch, five wide into the turn, three wide exiting, also went one
paced through the stretch. SHESHAPPY off a step slow, raced back and well wide, improved position by passing mostly tiring rivals. BLUEBIRD DAY off the
pace while inside, steadied toward the inside midway on the turn, failed to muster a rally. SHE'S MY RIDE off a step slow, remained back. THELMA AND
ANNIE (IRE) flashed brief early speed along the inside, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
FUNANDFUNNY away in good order, three wide into the turn, dueled turning for home, kicked clear the final furlong. ACE GILFORD bumped at the start to
race back early, saved ground turn, rallied up the rail to annex the place spot late, no threat to the winner. CONFESS broke alertly, showed the way early
toward the inside, dueled through the turn inside the winner, could not keep up with that one through the stretch, caught late for the place while finishing
outside the runner up. LITTLE CHIEF off a step slow, in some traffic into the turn, moved out, came five wide into the lane, second flight midstretch then
flattened out a bit in the late going. SUPER WISE in mid pack just off the inside, shuffled back into the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a
serious late kick. AXIS behind the pace inside, saved some ground into the lane, also lacked a contentious closing response. MORAL STANDARD went one
paced throughout while racing well off the inside. STONE SECRET fractious, popped stall doors prior to the start, broke with the field, raced forwardly and
between horses up the backstretch and into the turn before beginning to weaken late in the bend. BEGGARTHYSTAR void of speed, remained always
back. NAVEEN wide in the run up the backstretch, was finished early.

Footnotes
HERITAGE PARK broke alertly, dueled up the backstretch, cleared while three through the turn, maintained daylight through the stretch while being kept to
task. BOGEY off a step slow, continued well back turn, swung out widest exiting the turn, accelerated and finished up full of run to be in time for the place.
WHENTHEDOVESCRY off slowly, raced far back for a half, began a steady advance through the turn, chased the winner late, caught in the final strides for
the place. BLAME J D lacked speed in mid pack, improved a bit in the two path into the lane, chased the winner past the furlong marker, flattened late to
lose a couple of positions. WEAST HILL in the second group while racing outside, floated out to be five wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. MACHO
ROCCO dueled up front while along the inside, chased the winner through the turn while continuing to save some ground, steady retreat through the stretch.
DARK NINJA raced outside and off the pace up the backstretch, four wide through the turn, came up empty for the stretch run. CAPTAIN DON in the
second flight off the inside, was beginning to tire when floated out four wide into the lane, continued to fade. SOUIXPER CHARGER reluctant to load, off the
pace and the inside, had little left for the drive. FIVE O ONE failed to menace while saving ground. WASABI MOON raced always back while three wide.
DUSTY HILL forwardly placed for a half toward the inside, got out turning for home and gave way.

RAVENS REFLECTION away well, set the pace inside, shook clear in the turn, maintained a comfortable advantage through the stretch while being kept to
task. HE'S NO BULL pressed the winner early from the outside, chased that same rival through the turn, proved no match in the stretch, enough left to last
for the place. JERRYS PRIDENJOY forwardly placed while outside, three wide through the turn, set down for the drive, finished willingly to be getting to the
runner up latte. TENTWELVEFOURTEEN void of speed for a half, moved out a bit in the turn, widest for the drive, showed some interest down the middle of
the strip to improve position. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER broke back, raced outside, four wide into the lane, made little impact to the wire. BEEMIE AWARD
last away, moved up inside to race in the second flight, weakened. MAY WE ALL remained back in failing to menace. TOUGH STUFF was finished early.

Footnotes
ROLLING FORK took control soon after the start along the inside, rated through the turn, drew out under his own courage and under wrap to prove a handy
winner. RISKY SITUATION void of speed toward the inside, worked way out to four wide by late in the turn, rallied willingly to earn the place, not a threat to
the winner. KAT'S HITMAN with the first flight four wide and between horses into the turn, chased the winner into and through upper stretch, caught late for
the place, saved the show. ROLL DINERO ROLL last to leave, raced well back early, came five wide out of the turn, staged a mild rally to improve position.
MACHO ROCKET MAN pressed the issue while five wide up the backstretch and into the turn, came three wide into the lane, had little left for the drive.
GONNA GETCHA with the early pace three wide, began a retreat before a half. NO CUSSING flashed brief speed while between rivals, was finished before
a half. ONE WAY STREET sluggish from the start, pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
I WILL STAND stalked the pace from the outside, advanced on that rival in the second turn, dueled into the lane, wore that same foe down under steady
handling. HONORING MAJOR settled off the pace and the inside, three wide into the stretch, set down when straightened for home, late run for the place.
EXULTING broke on top, pace inside, pulled in the run up the backstretch, responded, stubborn until late. GAMBLER'S FALLACY lacked early foot out in
the strip, came three out to four wide out of the final turn, raced on equal terms with the runner up while outside that one past the furlong marker, flattened
out in the late going. CANADIAN GAME within striking distance while along the inside, came up empty for the drive. GREELEY AND BEN lacked speed
while racing toward the inside, also lacked a closing response. THE ROUGE DIESEL fell far back after the start, continued to lag the middle half, left with
too much to do in the lane. UPHOLD three wide when within striking distance early, was finished after a half.

furlong marker, also weakened in the late going to miss the show. BANK outrun early while outside, continued unhurried through the turn, came four wide
into the lane, roused for the drive, finished with good energy while widest to win going away. SILVER RATIO last to leave, trailed, went evenly through the

Footnotes
MARION FRANCIS within striking distance while in some traffic in the first turn, settled, ranged up four wide to challenge in the second turn, put a head in
front entering the stretch, edged away late under steady handling. SUNDIAL prompted the pace out in the strip, stalked three wide in the run up the
backstretch, challenged while remaining in the three path second turn and inside the winner, dueled with that one into the stretch, could not match that one
late, clearly second best. PRINCESS LEA broke sharp, vied up front along the inside, dueled up the backstretch, vied far turn, could not keep up with the
top pair stretch, remained clear of the others while remaining along the rail. MISS TULSA settled off the pace while saving ground, continued in even fashion
into and through the stretch in an even effort. PERKS D'ORO in some traffic in the first turn when off the pace, one paced backstretch, came three wide into
the stretch, improved slightly while not a serious threat. CHURCH SERVICE lacked speed while off the inside, raced four down to two wide final turn, also
went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing kick. CAPTAIN BEYOND broke back, lacked speed, picked off some tiring rivals while never a serious
threat. H'RAYFORCABERNEIGH broke in good order, dueled up front off the inside, gave way. MAMA LOU off a step slow, lagged well back, picked off a
couple of faltering rivals. SEEKING HONOR finished early, far back, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in, walked off. AKA LIONESS mid
pack early, stopped after a half, also was far back and distanced through the stretch, walked off.
