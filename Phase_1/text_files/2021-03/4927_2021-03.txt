Footnotes
FACTUAL allowed the two leaders to go early advanced under mostly her own courage through the turn, steered out three wide for the drive, took over
approaching the furlong marker, drew out under token encouragement to win ridden out. LITTLE SURE SHOT broke on top, got clear through a rapid
opening quarter, continued to show the way through the turn, offered little resistance to the winner when confronted by that one in upper stretch, no match to
the wire, all out to save the place. O K BABY void of early foot, swung out four wide turning for home, finished with some late interest to be getting to the
runner up. SOLEMN OATH off the pace while racing three wide, went evenly in the drive. PLAYFULMISSSAMURAI settled in mid pack while racing in the
two path, came up empty for the drive. ANOTHERINTHEFIRE chased the runner up in the two path, gave way in the drive. GREAT IN RED off slow, trailed
throughout along the inside in a dull effort.

Footnotes
HIT THE TICKET closest to the early leader, continued to chase that one up the backstretch, bid between foes turning for home, dug in late to gain the nod
in determined fashion. WAGON BOSS settled off the pace while racing toward the insdie, moved closer late in the final turn, briefly waited entering the
stretch, bid between foes a furlong out, missed the nod at the wire. TASHKENT back off the pace and the inside, crept closer three wide turning for home,
vied past the furlong marker, not enough in the late going for the top two, well clear of the others. ELITCH lacked early foot, saved ground much of the way,
went evenly in the drive when set down. IKE sprinted clear to show the way into and through the first turn, maintained a daylight advantage up the
backstretch, weakened when headed turning into the stretch. DEALIN' STELEN four wide into the first turn, lacked a rally. WITCH DOCTOR remained back
in failing to threaten. GOSPEL ABE trailed while racing four wide throughout. A WRONG ORDER OF FINISH WAS BRIEFLY POSTED THEN
CORRECTED PRIOR TO THE RACE BEING DECLARED OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
THORNISH broke sharp, fell back off the pace while in the two path, came three wide while in some traffic for the drive, clear stretch when roused, closed
willingly to be up in the final jump. MACHO ROCKET MAN came in to bump with an inner rival just after the break, raced in the main body, between foes
then four wide into the stretch, bid, took over, led late, nipped at the wire. GENTLE KNIGHT jostled just after the start to race back early, asked along in the
two path turn, came on the rail out of the turn, improved up the inside to finish willingly. ROLL DINERO ROLL away in good order, set or forced the pace in
the three path for a half, slightly larger advantage into the lane, weakened the final furlong. JESSE JONES behind the pace while racing outside, four wide
through the turn, came up empty for the stretch run. SPIRIT SOUL off a step slow, raced back, improved inside of several foes along the rail into the lane,
lacked a further response. MY LITTLE TIP in mid pack while racing outside, raced four wide through much of the turn, lacked a closing response while
widest in the drive. UNBRIDLED SHOES void of early speed, dropped inside late in the turn, passed some tiring rivals with some late interest, encountered
late traffic. BROADWAY JERRY in the second flight closest to the dueling leaders for a half, backed up in the drive. STOMPING HOTROD moved up to duel
closest to the inside the opening furlong, continued to alternate for the advantage through the turn, faltered in the drive. AWE BIRD was finished early while
racing three wide.

HERITAGE PARK broke on top, sprinted clear, set all the pace off the inside, won wrapped up late to win ridden out. ALL SHACKED UP chased the winner
throughout toward the inside, could do little with that rival in the drive, clearly second best. TENTWELVEFOURTEEN void of speed, raced four out to five
wide into the lane, staged a mild rally to be along for the show, no threat to the top two. HURRICANE JAKE in the second flight while racing off the inside,
failed to muster a significant response in the drive when called on. MINE MY TIME void of speed, improved while saving some ground into the stretch,
flattened out in the drive. FIREHORN off a step slow, raced back and outside, fanned six wide into the lane, no rally. REPLETE tired after a half. HIDDEN
RULER veered out sharply at the start, pulled up. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
AREEMAA back off the pace while five wide into the first turn, improved before a half, advanced on the leader far turn, took over late in that bend, drew
clear and extended that advantage with a steady left handed crop. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED broke on top, soon got clear, continued to lead by a wide
margin in the run up the backstretch, offered but brief resistance to the winner entering the stretch, clearly second best. OMI TEN settled off the pace and
the inside, continued one paced through the lane to finish best of the rest, no threat to the top two. MISS ALPHA BELLA off the pace and the inside, also
lacked a closing response. QUIET SURPRISE back off the pace while saving ground, also lacked a late response when called on for the drive. LAKE
SENSE failed to menace while racing off the inside. LYRICIST last to leave, trailed early, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. DEDE'S
TRICK was finished early. B REWARDING chased the runner up early, began to give way before a half, stopped in the drive, jogged across.

Footnotes
MISS ANTIOCH closest to the early leader, advanced and challenged between horses late in the turn, showed the way into the stretch, held the runner up
at bay the final furlong under firm handling. EURO ME behind the pace, boxed in through much of the turn while toward the inside, eased out a bit to be
three wide entering the stretch, tried the winner from the outside past the furlong grounds, could not get by. FLORIDA BIRD fell back to trail after the start,
continued unhurried in the two path turn, moved out a bit for the drive, improved position to be up for the show. SEKANI back off the pace while racing
outside, fanned five wide exiting the turn, lacked the needed closing kick, outfinished for the show. PROUD VICTORIA last to leave, lacked speed,
squeezed through a narrow opening turning into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. SAVEDBYANANGEL broke on top, set the early pace, vied through the
turn closest to the inside, allowed PROUD VICTORIA through turning for home when beginning to tire, continued to back up through the lane. BETTYANN
within striking distance for three furlongs, began a steady fade thereafter.

Footnotes
SHASTALOO pressed in hand, confident handling, took over into the far turn, quickly clear, drew off, geared down late. DUCHESS BUBBLES bothered just
after start, trailed early as a result, steered out four wide when beginning to advance in the second turn, finished willingly to be in time for the place, no
threat to the winner. FORTUNA ADIUVAT broke in good order, set the pace toward the inside, offered little resistance to the winner when that one took over
far turn, proved no match for that one to the wire, caught late for the place. FREEDOM BOUND four wide in the first turn, raced within striking distance the
middle half, came up empty late to be outkicked for the place and show. MAKING PROGRESS lacked speed off the inside, improved position off the inside
in the final turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. LOFTHOUSE six wide when with the main body into the first turn, had little for the drive. QUEENS
GIFT pulled early when off the pace, four wide second turn, failed to respond in the drive. JLOHR JAN forwardly placed early along the inside, began a
steady fade after a half. SUPER CASSIDY five wide into the first turn when back off the pace, stopped after a half, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
KEEP YOUR DISTANCE keen early when with the pace three wide and between rivals, dueled through the latter part of the turn, fell back off the runner up
when straightened for home, battled back in determined fashion to prove best late. KASSERINE PASS broke alertly, narrowly showed the way up the
backstretch closest to the inside, dueled inside the winner out of the turn, gained a larger advantage in upper stretch then could not match the winner late,
held sway for the place. JETS A GINNIN bothered at the start, raced in the second flight while improving a bit along the inside late turn, slowly getting to the
top pair while remaining along the inside. LIL MISS HOT MESS off the pace and the inside, raced three wide through the turn, lacked a closing response
when set down for the drive. JUST FLY lacked speed, raced four wide through the turn, one paced through the lane in also coming up empty. COULD YOU
broke in but with the leaders, vied between foes up the backstretch, gave way midway on the turn. IMAGINARY MUSIC broke back, trailed throughout in
showing little.

TEMPT FATE with the pace while between horses, shook clear when straightened for home, steadily increased advantage through the lane while kept to
pressure. BANDIT POINT devoid of speed for a half, saved ground into the lane, rallied up the inside, gained the nod at the wire for the place. J. E.'S
HANDMEDOWN broke back, moved up to vie while three wide into and through the turn, fell back off the winner when straightened for home, chased that
one past the furlong marker, nipped at the wire for the place. MAN IN THE CAN in the second flight while racing three wide, went evenly through the stretch
to lack a late punch. K J'S NOBILITY lacked speed, moved out, four wide exiting the turn, came up empty as well. HOONANI ROAD failed to menace in the
two path. DESTINY WAY vied up front along the inside for a half and gave way.
