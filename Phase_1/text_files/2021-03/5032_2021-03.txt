Footnotes
CATIPARI lied off of the pace two wide, rallied three wide turning for home to range up outside of SKY BOLT in upper stretch, then prevailed over that
battling rival with a sixteenth to go via a long drive. SKY BOLT vied inside of a pair of foes, shook clear from them at the quarter pole, shifted off of the rail in
upper stretch to meet CATIPARI's bid, but was bested by that foe a sixteenth out. ELLE'SBIGSEACRET saved ground off of the pace, swung four wide in
upper stretch, but only produced a mild kick while hanging on his left lead. DICK THE BRUISER got caught in the five path while off of the pace around the
turn, but improved through the lane for a minor share. RUN RABBIT vied two wide and between horses, but weakened at the quarter pole. SEVEN IRON
vied three wide, came under a drive to keep pace with an inner rival at the five sixteenths grounds, but was outkicked by an outer foe turning for home, and
faded thereafter. DEVILINTHEBOTTLE failed to factor. FIFTY ONE NINETY never got involved.

Footnotes
SISTA OF WAR settled off of the pace while caught five wide around the first turn, produced a stout five wide rally outside of foes around the far turn to bid
turning for home, drew off readily in upper stretch, and widened under steady urging. OUT OF POCKET saved ground far off of the pace, shifted four wide
while behind rivals in upper stretch, then split those foes inside the furlong marker, and stayed on to claim place late. MISS ESSIE stalked two to three wide,
but was outkicked by SISTA OF WAR at the quarter pole, quickly proved no match for that foe, then chased her home willingly, but was outfinished by an
inner foe for place. GRAY NAY tracked from midpack two wide, but failed to mount a rally. CATCH MY KITTY tracked from midpack four wide, but faded
when shuffled back around the far turn, and failed to make an impact thereafter. CONSOLING stalked along the inside, made an early bid to grab an
advantage with five furlongs remaining, showed the way into the far turn, but was headed entering the lane, and weakened thereafter. SPEAK ENGLISH set
the pace along the inside around the first turn while staying a path off of the inner rail, which allowed for CONSOLING to assume command passing the five
furlong pole, chased that foe around the far turn, then faded turning for home. ROWDY ON TOP was off slowly and outrun.

Footnotes
NORTH ELKHORN vied two wide and from between horses early on, cleared an inner foe into the turn, edged away from his outer counterpart passing the
furlong grounds, then tired late with a pair of foes in pursuit, but held. SO CAUGHT UP IN U tracked from midpack three wide, shifted five wide turning for
home, rallied through the final furlong to produce a late bid, but missed. FLIGHT TIME (BRZ) vied inside of a pair of foes early on, failed to keep pace with
them into the turn before being relegated to a chasing position, shifted outside of that pair turning for home, re-rallied inside of SO CAUGHT UP IN U
through the late stages, but did not have enough. LIMEHOUSEGAS vied three to two wide, but tired passing the furlong marker. SALTY RIM tracked from
midpack two wide, shifted four wide turning for home, but lacked a rally to threaten. CANTANKEROUS BOBBY lied far off of the pace outside of foes, got
spun seven wide entering the lane, and improved position. CONGRATS THIS saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. RED BLUE AND TRUE
chased along the inside, swung six wide straightening into the lane, but faded. RANSACK lied off of the pace three wide, and failed to factor. SUM
OVERTURE lied off of the pace two wide, and was done early. PEQUENO GRANDE was outrun.

Footnotes
KEARNY COUNTY trailed early on, rallied outside of foes around the far turn, swung seven wide turning for home, but sustained his charge to range up to
JOEY B in the final furlong, and prevailed under a long drive. JOEY B tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted two wide to split foes to produce a bid
passing the quarter pole, forged an advantage in upper stretch with KEARNY COUNTY menacing, dug in gamely inside of that rival through the late stages,
but was bested. RUNMALIBURUN hopped at the start and was last away, lied far off of the pace two wide, swung six wide turning for home, and stayed on
for a minor share. TOP HAT VOYAGER lied off of the pace two wide, came into the lane five wide, and stayed on between horses late, but was outfinished
by an outer foe for fourth. TELL ME A STORY lied off of the pace three wide, made a four wide bid for the lead entering the lane, but was outkicked by an
inner and an outer rival, chased them thereafter, but tired in the final furlong and lost show inside the final sixteenth. ST. RONANS stalked while being
closest in pursuit to the loose leader, inched closer to that foe from the two path around the far turn, but was outkicked by multiple rivals turning for home,
and faded. CROWN TO THE GOLD saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. ARCH YOU READY tracked from midpack two wide, but was done
early. GOT THE NOTION cleared into the first turn, opened up to long lead down the backstretch, but tired around the far turn, got overhauled turning for
home, and stopped through the lane. LAFLOWMYLAXBRO never got involved.

Footnotes
FALCONS FURY broke a bit slowly in minorly tight quarters, lied far off of the pace along the inside, rallied four to five wide around the far turn following
ALDO'S KITTEN's gain, bid outside of that foe in upper stretch, and drew off through the final furlong. ALDO'S KITTEN lied off of the pace three wide, rallied
in hand four wide around the far turn to bid for the lead turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong grounds, and proved second best.
DOM CAETANO (ARG) trailed early on, rallied five to six wide turning for home, and secured show through the final furlong. DARBY DART lied far off of the
pace two to three wide, then stayed on to claim a minor share. BELUSHI SAMURAI stalked three wide, but was outmoved by outer foes turning for home,
and faded. LINK TO DESTINY tracked from midpack two wide, but faded. BLAZED UP saved ground off of the pace, but failed to factor. JIMMYS
LIFESTYLE set the pace along the inside early on, allowed SAMSON LEE to clear off down the backstretch, stalked that foe before rebidding two wide into
the far turn, forged an advantage approaching the five sixteenths marker, but was headed entering the lane, and weakened. LODI lied forwardly placed
along the inside, but failed to produce a bid before faltering turning for home. SAMSON LEE vied outside of JIMMY'S LIFESTYLE around the first turn,
cleared that foe down the backstretch and opened up a clear margin, but was headed at the five sixteenths pole, and stopped through the lane.

CHA VEZ stalked along the inside, produced a rail bid in upper stretch, and prevailed while hanging on his left lead. VOLUBILE tracked from midpack three
wide, bid for the lead turning for home, forged an advantage in upper stretch, but hung and was outfinished by an inner foe. KIKINBOY set the pace along
the inside, but was headed at the quarter pole by an outer foe, then by an inner foe in midstretch, and kept on to hold show. PERFECTLY MAJESTIC saved
ground off of the pace, shifted four wide turning for home, but lacked a kick to make a bid while hanging on his left lead. CAUSEWAY CANDY was outrun.

Footnotes
TEMPEREYA settled far off of the pace, unleashed a strong five wide rally turning for home to sweep past the leaders entering the lane, drew clear before
tiring in the final furlong, but held from an oncharging MISTY VEIL at the wire. MISTY VEIL lied off of the pace along the inside, shifted four wide turning for
home, rallied with a clear TEMPEREYA to catch in the final furlong, but just ran out of ground. PETTIGO GIRL tracked from midpack four wide, bid for the
lead turning for home, but was outkicked by foes in upper stretch. VOLNAY saved ground while stalking along the inside, but lacked a rail kick through the
lane to produce a bid. HOW LUCKY stalked three to two wide, but was outmoved while awaiting clear racing room turning for home, but lacked a rally
thereafter. PIONEER'S CANDY tracked from midpack five wide, inched forward to a three wide stalking position down the backstretch, bid into the far turn,
but drifted out while weakening entering the lane, and was eased through the final furlong. SHE'S OUTTA HERE lied forwardly placed two wide and from
between horses, but was done early. TIZ D'ETAT hopped at the start and was off poorly, lagged well behind the field, and was outrun. CHIPSHIRE set the
pace along the inside, but was headed around the far turn before weakening turning for home, then was eased through the late stages.
