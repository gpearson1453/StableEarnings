Footnotes
CASA BONITA tracked the trio of leading duelers from outside of TRANS MISSISSIPPI around the turn, shifted outside of those rivals turning for home,
rallied alongside them passing the furlong pole, and drove clear thereafter. BILLY K vied for the lead three wide, but was outkicked by an outer foe passing
the furlong marker, then prevailed over an inner rival for place. TWITTERATI dueled for the lead two wide and from between horses, but was outkicked by
an outer rallying rival in midstretch, then lost place to another outer foe in the final sixteenth. FUNNY FLOWERS vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals,
but gave way in upper strech. TRANS MISSISSIPPI stalked the dueling leaders from along the inside, but lacked a bid and tired. SECRETS OF MY SOUL
leapt in the air at the start and spotted the field multiple lengths, then was subsequently outrun.

Footnotes
PRETTY IN PINK got carried out seven wide while achieving early position due to FULLY COMPLAINT's incident into the first turn, went on to vie for the
lead outside of UNUSUAL DANCER into the backstretch, then prevailed over that foe in the late stages while under a long drive. UNUSUAL DANCER vied
along the inside of the trouble-encountering eventual winner around the first turn, dug in to hold a narrow advantage from that rival through upper stretch
while hanging on her left lead, but could not keep that foe at bay inside at the sixteenth grounds. BONES AND ROSES rated far off of the pace, advanced
along the inside turning for home and through upper stretch before chasing the leading pair home. EASY DOES IT stalked along the inside, shifted outside
of the leading duelers turning for home, but hung on her left lead and lacked a kick to produce a bid. MS MICHELLE lied forwardly placed two wide, but
faded in upper stretch. GOLD ARROW lied forwardly placed before being bumped to the six path while between horses into the first turn, retreated to track
from midpack three wide around that bend, but faded turning for home. METAROSE was bumped and bothered by FULLY COMPLAINT into the first turn
when that foe failed to take the bend, and lost all best chance due to the incident, and was eased through the lane. FULLY COMPLIANT was uncontrollable
inside of a trio of early pace battling foes on the way to the first turn, drifted to the four path into that bend hampering those rivals, then was eased thereafter.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUN AROUND THE FIRST TURN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
LORD CHARLES pressed the leading duelers from the outside, joined the fray into the turn, forged an advantage pass the five sixteenths pole, then gamely
maintained his margin from an inner battling counterpart. BOUND TO GO dueled inside of MORE HONOR early on, then inside of LORD CHARLES as well
around the turn, but was headed by the latter approaching the quarter pole, dug in through the lane as that rival failed to kick away, and fought gamely to
the wire, but failed to regain even terms. MORE HONOR dueled for the lead two wide, then from between horses around the turn, but gave way to those
rivals in upper stretch. PUNALUU failed to factor. REIGN ON (GB) made little impact. SPOON BOSS trailed, took the turn far off of the pace three wide, and
never got involved.

Footnotes
WHO'S ASKING set the pace, inched clear turning for home, and held safe to the wire. RELIANT was off slowly and lied well off of the pace, swung to the
five path turning for home, and rallied through the lane, surged late, but ran out of ground to reach the leader late. QUICK TO FUSS pressed the eventual
winner from the outside, but failed to keep pace turning for home, and chased that rival through the lane. MARKING TIME chased two wide, but faded
through the final furlong. PANCAKES AND BEER failed to factor. CHARLIE C failed to menace. SUPERNOVA WILDCAT lied off of the pace four wide
around the turn, and never got involved. GRAND SLAM HOMERUN lied close up along the inside, but was finished before reaching the lane. SHE'LL PARK
got fractious in the gate and was backed out and reloaded before the start, the lied off of the pace three wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
HAVEULOSTYOURMIND got fractious in the paddock, saved ground from midpack, chased from tracking position around the far turn, shifted outside of the
clear leader in upper stretch, ranged up to that foe under a long drive in the final furlong, and edged away approaching the wire. VROYSKY set the pace
along the inside, shook clear passing the quarte pole, but was caught inside the final sixteenth. SHARK HUNTER saved ground off of the pace, then split
tiring foes inside the final furlong to improve for a minor reward. MONTANA JACK prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace turning for home,
and faded through the lane. CAPTAIN RED stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading pair into the backstretch, inched closer into the far turn to
vie three wide and between horses, but faltered turning for home. ESTEEMED tracked from midpack three to four wide around the turns, and tired through
the lane. WILL YA WIN SUM lied at the rear of the field along the inside, swung five wide in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. KEEN JAMES reared at the
start and broke many lengths behind the field, lied at the rear of the field in the three to five path, and faltered turning for home. JU JU GUY failed to get
involved. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
RIVER JUMPER dueled for the lead inside of LOVE LYRIC, cleared away from that foe with five sixteenths to run, opened up on the field in upper stretch,
and safely maintained a clear margin under moderate urging through the final furlong. MOUNTAIN PASS rallied from well off of the pace four wide around
the turn, then sustained that advance through the lane to prove second best. SWEET SASSAFRASSY chased the pace three wide, then prevailed over an
inner rival for show in the final furlong. CURRENTLYMYPROBLEM chased along the inside, held show into the final furlong, but lost that position at the
sixteenth pole ad failed to menace. YATAHEY failed to factor. SHE'SEVERSOCLEVER never got involved. LOVE LYRIC dueled for the lead two wide
outside of the eventual winner, but failed to keep pace at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened through the lane. DOLLIYS GOLD was reluctant to load,
broke outwardly, but was outrun throughout, and showed little. PER RULING #20-21TP059 FROM THE ARIZONA RACING COMMISSION, RIVER
JUMPER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

MEMPHIS DOLL dueled for the lead two wide, then from between horses into the turn, dug in turning for home as INDIA WILKES made a menacing bid, but
turned that foe away in midstretch, drew clear, and safely held thereafter. IROQUOIS HEART tracked from midpack two wide, tipped five wide in upper
stretch to commence a rally, achieved place while in pursuit of the clear leader in the final furlong, and held that position from KEANNA approaching the
wire. KEANNA trailed, swung to the seven path turning for home, rallied outside of tiring rivals, but just missed reaching place. INDIA WILKES gained four
wide around the turn to bid for the lead passing the quarter pole, but flattened out through midstretch. GLOA JEAN prompted the vied for the lead outside of
a pair of foes into and around the turn, but yielded between horses in upper stretch. CEDE'S DREAM was done early. SUCCESFUL SKY dueled for the
lead inside of a pair of rivals into the turn, but gave way to those foes with five sixteenths to run. MINISTER'S GIRL chased along the inside, but faded
through the lane.

furlong grounds at the leader drifted outwards, drove clear of that foe passing the furlong pole, and won going away. VINTAGE KITTEN trailed early on,
rallied five wide and outside of foes into the far turn to bid around that bid, but hung on his left lead through the lane, was outkicked by an inner rival at the
furlong grounds, and yielded thereafter. GO FOR A RIDE vied for the lead two wide, showed the way from a pair of outer foes around the far turn, drifted
outwards to meet their bids in upper stretch, but was surpassed by an inner foe at the furlong grounds, and was bested by an outer rival for place in the late
stages. ONCE ON WHISKEY lied forwardly placed three wide, bid for the lead between horses around the far turn, but flattened out in midstretch.
BOURBON TRAFFIC stalked two wide, got outmoved by an outer foe into the far turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, but failed to change leads
through the lane, and chased the leaders home. CURRY FLURRY saved ground in midpack, but to no avail. HOLY MUCHACHO lied far off of the pace two
to three wide around the turns, and never got involved. KENJILOOKSLUCKY tracked from midpack three to four wide, but was outmoved into the far turn
before fading around it. INDY MOON vied along the inside early on, stalked the pace around the far turn, but faded in upper stretch.
