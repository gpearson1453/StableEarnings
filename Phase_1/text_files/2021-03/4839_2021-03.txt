Footnotes
FULL MOON FEVER away in good order, tucked into the two path at the top of the clubhouse bend, accompanied the pacesetter under a good hold,
inhaled that opponent when ready in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, had already lengthened away when asked for more a furlong down the road,
drew out even more convincingly then got put back to a firm hold from the sixteenth pole onward. COX'S LEDGE along the inside, vied with the winner until
the five-sixteenths pole, got displaced even when put to stronger handling, had no difficulty securing the place. HOLD THE IRISH squeezed coming onto the
first turn as the winner was being maneuvered into the two path, raced three wide around it, was one path closer to the rail on the subsequent, came three
wide into the lane and got the show. RUMDUM BYDA SEA saved ground to the quarter pole while failing to contend.

KING OF AMERICAN coaxed from the gate, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn getting
coaxed along through the bend isolated between two flights, advanced through the latter portion of the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to
issue a challenge and take command inside the eighth pole, then went clear under a drive to prevail. UNBRIDLED JOHN brushed the off side stall at the
start, dueled early on along the inside with BULWARK to his outside shaking away from the rest, got joined five furlongs from home, by MENTAL MODEL
and vied inside a pair through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was
collared inside the eighth pole, proved no match for the top one while keeping on clear of the rest for the place honors. MENTAL MODEL broke out at the
start bumping NO MORE MIRACLES, chased two to three wide early on before advancing to split rivals up front vying between foes from five furlongs out
through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, got shaken off a bit at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened while
along clear for the show honors. CURLIN'S KNIGHT coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide
into upper stretch and tired. BULWARK coaxed from the start, dueled early on from the three path with UNBRIDLED JOHN to his inside, had MENTAL
MODEL advance five furlongs from home and vied outside that pair through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into
upper stretch shaken off and tired. SUPER WICKED CHARM coaxed from the gate, took the overland route six to seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then five wide through the turn, went six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. LIGHTNING ROB chased two to three wide down the
backstretch, tucked inside into the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, had the rider lose the handle on the whip just inside that station to the off
side, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. NO MORE MIRACLES got bumped at the start by MENTAL MODEL, who broke outwards, chased
three then two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside for home and faltered.

MONEY IN THE BANK once again with the pilot not sporting a whip, dove over to the rail coming up to the top of the turn, awaited options beginning from
the five-sixteenths pole, forced to draft behind MR PHIL, angled eagerly to the outside and towards clearance stepping onto the head of the stretch,
straightened away in the neighborhood of path four and took off in earnest after the one to catch, forged to the lead deep into the furlong grounds, kept
going well to stay in the clear. MR PHIL found himself to be the innermost of three contending for the top after the field had been sent off and running,
cleared both of them during the run around the bend spaced at a slight distance from off the inside, was more in path two when set down for the drive home,
got collared a short distance from the eighth pole, kept pace with the winner afterwards, but wasn't good enough to reclaim the advantage. TAPIZEARANCE
broke about a length the tardiest, cut over to the inside route, took it for nearly a half, got maneuvered into the five path from upper to midstretch, rallied
mildly for the third. TRUEBELIEVE three wide onto the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, flattened out. PROMO CODE between
opponents disputing the pace on the backstretch, stalked the leader from path two on the turn, was on the inside route coming into the stretch, gave way.
MISSION WRAPITUP the outermost of a trio vying for the advantage, chased MR PHIL two to three wide on the bend, was more the former heading home,
backed away.

OHYOUDIDNTKNOW four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled in to cut the corner into upper stretch advancing to
take command just outside the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive under threat dueling to the finish and gamely repelled the challenge to the wire.
ORPHAN HALLIE four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the
final furlong knocking heads to the finish but was ultimately rebuffed at the end. KITH chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
spun three wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. LORENZEN chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths when
tipping to the two path, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. LOTSNLOTSOFCHROME chased three to four wide under a ride from three
furlongs out, swung four wide for home and tired. BOURBON RISING chased two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked inside through the turn
and was placed to coaxing midway, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. GRECIAN PHAROAH three to four wide in pursuit under coaxing
from the seven-sixteenths, cornered four wide for home and tired. LADY'S BOY showed the way in hand three then two wide spurting away a bit early on,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths still safely clear, got overwhelmed swinging just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened
away and gave way. MR GHOST stumbled at the start, recovered to show brief speed chasing just off the inside, faded approaching the half mile pole,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went three wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
INDIAN COUNSELOR off the rail throughout, disputed the pace from path two on the turn, went about its business from between rivals during the middle
stages of the run around the bend, was on near even terms with COLORMEPAZZI when let out at the three-sixteenths pole, emerged a sixteenth later as
the leader, felt the presence of the top one in the final stages, reached the wire in time to prevail. DANGEROUS EDGE reserved two wide during the journey
leading up to the half mile pole, tipped into path three springing from that station, flashed interest late on the turn, swung out towards path four for the drive
home, closed in on the winner in a steadfast manner, shied out from some left pressure in the final furlong, missed. COLORMEPAZZI disputed the pace
towards the inside on the turn after having been mostly two wide prior, got driven into the stretch, relinquished in the general area of the three-sixteenths
pole, stayed on for the show. TRUE PALACE strung out four wide on the turn, got sent into the the five path entering the stretch, launched no bids en route
for the final significant slice of the purse. UNRELENTING FORCE hustled on the chute, argued for control from along the inside route for a half, folded.
OPEN LENGTHS saved ground for the opening half, was worked into the three path from the top of turn until its midway point, commenced the stretch
slightly wider, made no impact. SPITBALL forwardly placed three wide early, gave way.

Footnotes
MAIDEN BEAUTY cut over to the inside, showed the way, tailed by GRACETOWN from the outside, inched away from the nemesis on the bend, was
coming up to the three-sixteenths pole when finally asked for more, gave the desired response, holding on well to stave off the aforementioned foe.
GRACETOWN squared off with the winner from path two, was shaken off as the pair made their way around the turn, swung into the lane, failed to dent the
deficit, salvaged second. STAND FOR THE FLAG took up position in midpack, pursued the pace two wide on the turn, angled into the third one for the
stretch run, rallied sufficiently so to be along for the show. TIMELY TRADITION a forward factor three wide for the opening six furlongs, gave way.
PERSISTO made it way towards the inside route, getting there prior to departing the backstretch, cut the corner into the stretch, had no punch. VIOLENT
TRICK rode the rail for three-quarters to no avail. STAY SMART hustled on the chute, travelled four wide on the turn, tipped out one path wider in upper
stretch, gave out.

Footnotes
LOVE THAT FACE hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn and widened away, took the inside route
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and held well to the finish. BUSTIN BAY hustled from the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, ran on dueling through to the finish with RAINBOW GAL and bested that foe on the wire for the place
honors. RAINBOW GAL coaxed from the gate, chased four wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and ran on dueling to the finish with the aforementioned foe but was ultimately bested for the
place honors while well clear of the rest for the show. BIG TONY'S GIRL chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to
four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. CAPTIVATING CARA five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung five
wide into upper stretch and tired. COMPETION QUEEN coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. TRICK THE UNIVERSE five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and made no impact. LOVELEE
HONOR six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway, swung three to four wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. WHAT MIGHTAVEBEEN coaxed from the gate, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide
through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, went six to seven wide for home and folded. NEW YORK BANKER six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, went four wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and faltered.
