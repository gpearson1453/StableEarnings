Footnotes
SEVIER broke alertly, cleared before a quarter, continued to show the way through the turn toward the inside respond when the winner challenged when
straightened for home, long, spirited duel to the wire, dug in late to narrowly prevail in game fashion. D' RAPPER away in good order, closest to the winner
in the two path, crept closer turning for home, challenged soon after, dueled to the wire, could not get by. CHAMPAGNEONME lacked early foot, saved
ground turn, behind some traffic late in the bend, split foes when clear past the furlong marker, edged clear of the others while not a threat to the top two.
HARPER last to leave, lacked speed while along the inside, went evenly through the stretch. SEDARIS four wide through much of the turn when within
striking distance, had little left for the drive. MUSIC TO MY EARS prompted the pace while racing three wide, weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
DO ME A FAVOR away in good order, chased the leader into and through the turn, collared that rival from the outside nearing the furlong grounds, took
over, enough left late to hold the runner up safe. RUN FEARLESS broke alertly, fell back in mid pack early while outside, advanced three wide through
some traffic turning for home, late bid outside the winner, narrowly missed. FLIRTATIOUS SMILE void of speed just off the inside, improved inside of some
traffic late in the turn, two path into the lane, continued that mild rally to be up for the show. SERIOUSLY SASSY raced off the early pace inside, moved
closer while continuing to save ground in the turn, faltered in the drive. OLIVIAN broke well, quickly sprinted clear, large lead into the turn, continued to lead
by daylight into the stretch, folded readily when headed by the winner with just less than a furlong remaining. JERI DAWN off a step slow, never menaced.
PEANUT within striking distance out in the strip, three out to four wide late in the turn, faded through the stretch. CALICO DREAMER fell back to trail after
the start, never involved, showed little.

SOLDIER BOY closest to the leader off the inside, chased that one through the turn, collared that same rival into the stretch, challenged from the outside
when straightened for home, clear past the furlong marker, enough left to hold off the runner up late. CHICKEN TRUCK in the second flight while outside,
four wide into the turn, three wide exiting the bend, set down, rallied to be getting to the winner late. EAST MOON LAKE lacked early foot inside, worked
way out to be three wide into the lane, rallied for the show to finish up willingly while also closing the gap on the top two. HOOKED A GOODWIN moved up
to take control soon after the start, clear into the turn, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner when that one challenged turning for home then faltered
when headed by that foe into the stretch. WINGS UP fell back to trail after the break, continued to lag turn, two path into the lane, passed tiring rivals while
not a serious threat. BOO REID in the second flight while outside, three wide through the turn, weakened through the stretch. GOTTA LOVE IKE remained
always back while racing three wide. RUN AWAY SON forwardly placed in the early going after moving to the inside, continued to save ground into the turn
then began to fade before three furlongs.

Footnotes
ROCK RIDGE settled off the pace and the inside, took over from the outside from the pacesetter late, well clear late under steady handling. NILES
CHANNEL broke back, void of speed, saved ground through the turn, rallied up the rail to finish willingly and annexed the place. GREATER CAIRO one
paced while racing off the inside, continued in midpack while three wide exiting the turn, mild interest, not enuf for 2nd. SOUTHSIDE SWIG broke alertly,
quickly sprinted clear, large advantage into the turn through a quick opening quarter, bit of a breather late in the turn, offered little resistance to the winner
when confronted by that one with less than a furlong remaining, caught late for the place. THE BIG BLUFF lacked speed along the inside, saved ground to
no avail. BODE'S LIGHT in the second flight early, came out a bit four wide turning for home, tired. WYOMING CONQUEST chased the early leader from
along the inside, backed up after a half. HARD TO PARK dwelt at the start then broke awkwardly to spot the field several lengths, remained always back in
trailing throughout.

Footnotes
BITUMEN forwardly placed off the inside, two path into the turn, bid, took over, turning for home, clear past the furlong marker, held the runner up safe late
under steady handling. IMPUNITY broke with the pace, three wide through the turn when moving a bit closer, could do little with the winner in the late going
while clear for the place. BALANDEEN within striking distance while along the inside, continued to save ground turn, finished up evenly in lacking a late
punch. LITTLE NO WAY with the main body off the inside in the run up the backstretch, three out to four wide turn when making a mild gain, continued to
show moderate interest to the wire. HUBBADAHUBBADABOOM broke well, cleared to the inside before a quarter, showed the way through most of the
turn, weakened when headed by the winner. WHITE WOLF in the second flight toward the inside the opening quarter, two path through most of the turn,
went evenly through the stretch in lacking a late punch. BAR STOOL BUDGET broke back, made little impact after racing two out to three wide through the
turn. FLASHYMEISTER last to leave, trailed most of the way. DEACON closest to the leader early, shuffled back just before a quarter, faded through the
lane to trail home late.

between horses, dueled into the lane, bid between, proved no match for the winner late, edged clear for the place. OMEN OF CHANGE got clear briefly
along the inside first turn, vied the middle half, continued to narrowly show the way into the lane when dueling with the runner up, also proved no match for
that one late, could not match runner up, clear of the others. PICKFORD in some traffic early in the first turn, back off the leaders inside, steadied in traffic
while remaining along the rail turning for home, finished up evenly when clear to be no threat to the top three. MISSISSIPPI pressured the early leader,
mixed it up with that one while between rivals the middle four furlongs. SONNY SMACK fell well back after the start, continued to lag and was never
involved. SHWEET PERSUASION pressed the issue four wide, continued outside and gave way in the far turn.

Footnotes
THOMAS SHELBY dueled up front along the inside, vied up the backstretch while remaining inside, clear in the second turn, increased advantage through
the lane while being kept to task. BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN angled to the inside when outrun into the first turn, raced back, advanced 4w 2nd turn, closest
late in the bend then could not keep up with the winner through the stretch, clearly second best. SOLOMONIC lacked speed off the inside, three wide
through the second bend, mild rally to finish best of the rest. AZTEC EMPIRE off a step slow, raced in the two path when well back, closer late in the final
bend, checked up in traffic entering the stretch, recovered and improved position when clear, no real threat. DERBY CODE lacked early foot while saving
ground, advanced, three wide in some traffic turning for home, improved position while also not posing a serious threat. URBANITE broke back, void of
speed, fanned 4w into the lane, improved by passing tiring rivals. OPTIMUS KAT was finished after a half. CATHOLIC GUILT with the pace three wide
early, continued to vie, gave way from between horses in the second turn, continued to fade. ALL EYES WEST dueled early in the two path, vied up front
between rivals for four furlongs, steadily retreated thereafter.

Footnotes
VAULT last to leave, began a steady three wide bid second turn, challenged on the outside in upper stretch, vied past the furlong marker while widest of the
first turn, edged clear late under steady handling. '. ISTAN COUNCIL prompted the pace while off the inside, advanced outside the leader to challenge in the
second turn, battled between rivals and inside the winner past midstretch, could not match strides with that rival late, clearly second best. GOODBYE EARL
settled off the pace just off the inside, within striking distance into the far turn, displayed some mild interest to be along for the show. PIECE OF MY HEART
showed the way into the first turn along the inside, rated through some soft splits, responded when challenged in the second turn, continued to contest the
issue nearing the furlong grounds, proved no match for the top two late, weakened. BEACH FLOWER fell well back after the start and was never a factor.
BLESSED AGAIN forwardly placed for six furlongs three wide, came four wide into the lane when beginning to tire, continued to fade to the wire.

Footnotes
TEMPT FATE broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, narrowly showed the way through the turn, disposed of the other speed nearing the furlong
marker, maintained daylight to the wire while being kept to task. MAN IN THE CAN within striking distance outside, bit closer three wide turning for home,
chased the winner past the furlong marker, could do little more with that one the final furlong, held well to earn the place. BANDIT POINT last away, lagged
three wide behind the field through the turn, moved out widest for the drive, found best stride down the middle part of the strip, up late for the show. J. E.'S
HANDMEDOWN broke with the field, raced in mid pack outside, four wide through the turn, in good position to strike at the head of the lane, did not fire to
finish up evenly. BEBOP SHOES slight bobble at the start, pressed the winner early from the outside, vied between the top two into the stretch, faltered the
final furlong. REEF'S DESTINY lacked speed in the two path, had little left for the stretch. GLACKEN'S GHOST settled off the pace inside, continued to
save ground turn, retreated in the run through the stretch.

Footnotes
MR. WIRELESS pressed the leader in the two path, continued to apply pressure to that one in the run up the backstretch, fell back off that same rival turning
for home, came back late, just up. STILLETO BOY broke on top, cleared to the inside into the first turn, set all the pace under light restraint, larger
advantage when straightened for home, relented to the winner late, remained clear for the place. CASH ROCKET settled off the pace, in the path in the
second flight far turn, lost contact with the top pair late in that bend, long drive for the show, determined. CRYO forwardly placed while racing in the three
path, second group while continuing three wide in the final turn, long drive for the show, outkicked late. RIGHT TONE in mid pack while racing outside, four
wide through the first turn, again in the second turn, went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing kick. W W CRAZY off slow, bothered to be well back early,
moved outside, pulled, moved inside, angled back out late in the final turn, improved. HAPPY ROMANCE off a step slow, raced back, picked off a couple of
tiring rivals while not a serious threat. RAM bobbled then was bothered at the break, remained always back. CAERUS broke out bothering outer rivals,
settled off the pace, faded after five furlongs. DUPUIS bothered, pushed out start, finished early, eased, walked off.
