Footnotes
LOOPALLU acted-up just as the gate opened but still broke in front, tracked the pace down the backstretch, was given his cue in the three path on the turn,
came four wide into the stretch, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, shook clear into the final furlong and prevailed under steady urging. JUST BLAZE was
hustled from the start then well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, chased the winner in the stretch and was second best. CHEERS TO
BERTI tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong
and weakened but was clear for the show. SPECTROLITE displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two
path, lost the advantage in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. TIGERBEACH broke a step slow, settled towards the rear, went four
wide on the turn and failed to threaten. HOTFOOT settled off the pace, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch then quickly moved further
out and failed to rally. FLEETWAY was urged along off the pace, dropped back while inside on the turn and failed to respond. CADET CAPTAIN was urged
along at the rear, dropped from five to three wide early on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
LODE OF BLARNEY angled in while showing speed, dictated terms while inside through the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch and drew
off under steady urging. FAITH'S RACEDAY was taken in hand briefly early then moved out, raced towards the front, went three wide on the turn, came four
wide into the stretch and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. ADEEB brushed with a foe early, was rated on the outside, went four
wide while let out on the turn, chased outside into upper stretch, drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole and just missed the place while able to get the show.
IN THE ARCH brushed with a rival early, settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn then came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. MAX PANDOWDY broke out and bumped with a rival then dropped back, went three wide on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and
failed to threaten. MAGIC CARPET bumped with an opponent at the start, bumped with another foe early, was urged along off the pace, went four then
three wide on the turn and failed to rally. DUBLIN YINZ MONEY tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the turn, chased into upper
stretch and tired. DA GOLD ROOM broke out and bumped with a foe, raced off the pace, went three then two wide on the turn and was no factor.
DAGGERS ARCH showed early speed then dropped back near the half-mile pole, fell further back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and
retreated.

Footnotes
YES I'M EVIL went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused while four wide early on the far turn then dropped to the two path, rallied
three wide into the stretch and closed strongly to get up late. ALL FACT broke in and bumped with a foe, angled quickly to the rail, contested the pace on
the inside of a rival, moved clear leaving the backstretch, drew off while inside on the far turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch then came under the
crop, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while far clear for the place. BREAK AT DAWN was bumped at the start and forced into another foe then
bobbled, went two to three wide on the turns and failed to threaten. LEBKUCHEN was bumped at the start then forced into another opponent, saved ground
on the turns and failed to respond. MARYWOOD broke out and hit the gate then bumped with a rival, was taken up when ALL FACT crossed in front early,
moved up outside that foe shortly thereafter to dispute the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch and stopped.

Footnotes
STRONG BEAUTY chased the pace down the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths, took the lead into upper
stretch, responded well to the threat of the runner-up while still on her inside lead in the drive and held under strong urging. SUZIE'S DREAM settled off the
pace, went three then four wide on the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed well to loom a threat into the final furlong but was turned away and
settled for the place. GALAXY THIRTYSIX settled off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, gained six wide into upper stretch, held a good striking
position into the final furlong but flattened out while able to get the show. YES GORGEOUS bumped lightly with a rival early, settled on the outside, dropped
from five to three wide on the turn and improved position. SIENNA BREEZE settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed response.
DIXIE LADY showed good speed and set the pace, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead into upper stretch and gave way. PLAY UNIFIED bumped
lightly with a foe early, was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LADY BE GONE
dropped back at the start, settled at the rear, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. ECHOESOFTIME moved out while chasing the pace, went two
then three wide on the turn and faded. MONEY WELL SPENT was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn then spun six wide into the stretch
and faltered.
