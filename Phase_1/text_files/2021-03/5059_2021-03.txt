Footnotes
SHEZA HOT FLASH set the pace along the inside, drew off entering the lane, drifted out through the stretch, but maintained a clear advantage as HONEST
N LUCKY pursued along the inside. HONEST N LUCKY stalked along the inside, chased the leader through upper stretch, produced an bid inside of that
foe as that foe wandered, then was gaining through the final furlong, but did not have enough. BETTY JEAN prompted the pace two wide, vied around the
far turn, but faded turning for home, then held show through the lane. YANKEE PRIDE tracked from midpack four wide around the turns, inched closer in
upper stretch, but failed to make an impact. BREEZY BEE failed to factor. KOTTONCANDY KISSES was never involved. TICKET TO RICHES was outrun,
and eased through the lane. Due to a timer malfunction the opening quarter time was unavailable.

tiring leaders in the final furlong to attempt a late bid, but did not have enough to reach the leader. LASTCALLFORALCOHOL got fractious and threw his
rider from the gate before the race, stalked along the inside, bid for the lead outside A FLICKER OFSILVER turning for home, but hung on his left lead and
faltered in midstretch. RUN FREE lied forwardly placed two wide, three wide turning for home, then drifted out through the lane while fading. SPECIAL

MARKANTONY'SQUEEN loped clear in the paceless affair three wide around the first turn, showed the way feeling pressure from FAVORITE SISTER
towards her inside around the far turn, drew away from that foe at the five sixteenths marker, then held sway from the rallying E TICKET RIDE through the
lane. E TICKET RIDE lied off of the pace four wide around the first turn, chased the pace three wide around the far turn, then stayed on through the lane to
prove second best. FAVORITE SISTER stalked along the inside, vied inside of the eventual winner into the far turn, but faded at the five sixteenths pole,
and tired thereafter. GOSPEL JOSY JAN tracked along the inside around the first turn before moving two wide and between horses into the backstretch,
then faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
KIPPER broke outwardly, got caught five wide around the turn while tracking the pace, but rallied to bid outside of rivals at the furlong pole, and drove clear
passing that marker. VICTORY STRIPE prompted the pace four wide, inched closer turning for home to bid at the quarter pole, but got outkicked by an
outer foe while achieving place at the furlong grounds, then held that position over MIGHTY BUGSY to the wire. MIGHTY BUGSY vied three wide, then two
wide and between horses yet still in the three path around the turn, but was outkicked by multiple outer rivals in midstretch, kept on inside of VICTORY
STRIPE to sustain a battle for place, but failed to regain even terms with that foe. REBEL RUMBLE trailed, swung six wide turning for home, and improved
position. WOODS OF CONGAREE failed to factor. CROSSING DIXIE vied for the lead two wide and between horses early on, then inside of a pair of foes
while a path off of the rail around the turn, but tired in upper stretch. OUR LION KING made little impact. EL CHIHUAS vied along the inside early on, failed
to keep pace into the turn, then further faded through the lane.

Footnotes
OKIE NATIVE dueled for the lead inside of CATCH THIS STAR, dug in while drifting out on his left lead through upper stretch, then lasted between horses
in the late stages. CATCH THIS STAR dueled for the lead two wide, got floated three wide in upper stretch, sustained the battle through a long drive, but
missed. OKLAHOMA SWING was reluctant to load, stalked along the inside, then from outside of the dueling leaders around the turn, shifted inside of those
foes approaching the furlong pole as the inner one drifted out, produced a rail bid, but missed. SPIKED CIDER tracked from midpack four wide through the
turn, then chased the leading trio through the stretch. POPPY'S OATS was off slowly, lied far off along the inside, shifted two wide in upper stretch, then
stayed on to improve position through the lane. IMALITTLESILVER failed to factor. DENS D ORO was off poorly, lied far off of the pace along the inside,
advanced to midpack around the turn, but tired through the lane. LETSPLAYAGAME was done early.
