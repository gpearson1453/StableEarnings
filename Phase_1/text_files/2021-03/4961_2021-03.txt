Footnotes
TOMASINO dueled along the inside of rival on the backstretch, continued to duel on the turn and shook free in upper stretch, held on gamely to just hold off
closing rival. DEVIL'S TEETH off slow, and crowded at the start, settled into a stalking position along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the rail
on the turn, angled out three wide approaching the stretch, eased out into four path in the stretch and rallied strongly to just miss. HYDROSTATIC dueled
outside of rival on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, gave way in upper stretch but held on to show. RIDGEFIELD ROCKET chased leaders
two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and finished up evenly in the stretch. SON OF A QUEEN tracked leader two wide on the
backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch in the three path and kept to task while besting rest. DOHENY BEACH stumbled at the start,
stalked leaders two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and failed to launch a rally in the stretch. MYSTIC GREY chased dueling
leaders along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn and lacked needed kick in the stretch to contend.
