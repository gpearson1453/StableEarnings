looming into upper stretch angling out a bit to keep outside position needing more in the closing yards. ITZAFRIENDSHIPSHOT set a pressured pace

Footnotes
GALACTIC away alertly set a pressured pace digging in along the rail down the lane holding on gamely at the end. LITTLE BLAKER chased through the
turn looming abreast foe down the lane giving a final push being denied at the wire. RIDING IN THE WIND a step slow through the turn gave a mild rally
under a drive moving past the others. CANT BUY COOL pressured the pace extending along the inside in upper stretch wearing out the final eighth. JEDI
TEMPLE raced mid pack posing no menace. JACK BE FAST gave way on the turn. GOLDEN AFLEET was always outrun. ATTACK ANGLE hopped
missing the break.
