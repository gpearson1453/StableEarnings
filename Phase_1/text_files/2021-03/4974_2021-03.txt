Footnotes
PORT MARIA was away alertly and quickly made the lead, repulsed a bid at the half mile pole, drew off in the stretch under confident handling to win as
much the best. IMMACULATE HEART chased the winner throughout, was no match late but held place. DANZIG RAINBOW contended throughout and
went evenly in the lane. DOROTHYFROMDUBLIN was allowed to settle early, swung six wide in the stretch and was no threat. GENTLE KISS allowed to
settle, failed to menace. LADY KIM had good position early and was through after a half. PROUD MAID MARIAN pressed inside and tired on the turn.
JERSEY CHASER wide early, was outrun.

SHADOW SURPRISE broke sharp and quickly made the lead, led throughout and remained well clear under confident handling. AMIGO'S AFFAIR chased
the winner throughout, could not gain late but held place. KHALFANI never far back, had a mild rally while no threat. GIANT BOO BOO wide early, drooped
to the inside in the stretch and had mild bid. MONTAUK COVE contended until the top of the stretch and gradually weakened. ODIE allowed to settle, failed
to menace. TREETOP FLYER had good position early, went wide in the stretch and was eased to the wire and walked off.

placed early, swung five wide in the stretch and lacked a late response. NEVER FOREVER raced wide early and was no menace. LEMON WATER raced
mid pack and had no late bid. NATALIA'S TEMPLE was outrun. BETTER THAN PEARLS raced wide and was no menace.
