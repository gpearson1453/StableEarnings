Footnotes
IFEELGOOD broke sharply, tracked off the first flight under light rating in the opening quarter, made steady progress three deep between foes to gain terms
with those rivals nearing upper stretch and responded to firm encouragement to wrest command and kick clear in the last furlong. ON DUTY ducked out at
the start crossing into the path of CLEAR WONDER, was righted, then urged prompting a rival's pace through the backstretch, dueled for command
between foes past midstretch but proved no match for the winner late while edging a rival for the place honors. ERIN GO BRAUGH, urged to the lead along
the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, dueled into upper stretch and yielded to the top pair late. MONROES DREAM settled into
stride while shifting off the inside, then continued with an even effort between foes to gain position into the stretch. DISTINCTIVE ECHO angled to the inside
in early stages but failed to menace. SEWEL, slow into stride, trailed the field to the stretch. CLEAR WONDER, forced out at the start, was righted to make
brief pursuit of the leaders four wide into the turn but emptied out early.

JUSTLYREWARDED switched to the outside leaving the gap tracking the leaders from out of striking distance, was prompted to commence a steady
advance on the turn while shifting out four wide nearing upper stretch, took over leaving the furlong marker and kicked away under some right handed
pressure. PAPA LUKE broke readily, prompted the pace three wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival on the turn, shifted out to resist
challengers in upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner while prevailing for second. HE'S ROYALTY was rated tracking just off the first flight racing to
the turn, advanced three wide nearing the lane to challenge, angled inwards to split foes in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. STARSHIP
BUTLER, in touch with the first flight between rivals in the opening stages, was eased back from that position to track the leaders racing into the turn but had
no closing bid. FOGGY ALBION was rated out of striking distance off the inside, angled five wide in upper stretch but made no impression. MARSAC, urged
inside foes through the backstretch into the turn disputing the pace, gave way into upper stretch. ELUSIVE ROAD trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BLACK V. K. angled inside while moving to gain the advantage racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin, conceded the lead to attend a
rival's pace through the backstretch into the far turn, pressed the issue nearing upper stretch to regain the advantage, shifted off the inside and went clear
under firm encouragement. EL AFORTUNADO was rated just off the leaders along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped three wide nearing upper
stretch to advance between rivals and proved best of the others. GIOVANE'S PROMISE was settled in hand while angling to the inside racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance inside foes nearing upper stretch and continued evenly while earning a share. ABUELO NUNO settled outside a rival
racing to the backstretch, advanced four wide on the far turn to upper stretch to briefly gain contention but lacked the needed late kick. FLIPPING FUN,
caught four wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to contend, shifted inwards entering the backstretch pressing the pace to gain the advantage
just before a half, dueled outside the winner into the far turn and gave way between foes into the stretch. VIGO vied briefly with the first flight between foes
to the backstretch but dropped out early. MAN OF MEN, urged three wide between foes into the first turn prompting the pace, retreated from contention
early.

Footnotes
DELFT BLUE, in touch with the pacesetter prompting that rival racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn to gain the advantage racing into
upper stretch, edged forward nearing midstretch, drifted out despite right handed pressure to turn back challenges and held sway to the end. OUR STUIE
tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled inwards to gain a position just off the leaders nearing the far turn, shifted out to bid
between rivals three deep nearing midstretch, was bumped, then squeezed when losing his path, altered course in the closing stages and narrowly
prevailed for second on the wire. NEFARIOUS FELLA, forwardly placed three deep in the opening stages, was urged to challenge in that path in upper
stretch, exchanged contact with OUR STUIE while being carried out slightly leaving the midstretch and was just outkicked by the top pair. UNCLE
CHARMING ducked in at the start bumping THE WILD FLYER, urged to dictate the pace on a narrow margin along the inside racing to the far turn, dueled
for command into upper stretch and gave way late. LEND AMERICA, bumped at the start, was reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, made
steady progress inside foes racing into the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, then was fanned five wide nearing the furlong marker and finished evenly
late. THE WILD FLYER, bumped at the start, was righted to track off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch
while being prompted to advance, was fanned six wide midstretch and had no final kick. RAL COBRA CREEK tracked just off the first flight along the inside
to the backstretch and steadily faded racing into the far turn. KINDLY settled between foes racing through the chute, was caught wide to the backstretch and
failed to menace thereafter. CAPTAIN FUN, bumped at the start, was steadied avoiding tight quarters leaving the chute, ducked out while racing wide into
the first turn and proved no threat. WILD CHASE, caught wide racing to the first turn, retreated early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE THE RIDER OF OUR
STUIE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF DELFT BLUE WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY.
AFTER REVIEWING THE THE STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED DELFT BLUE FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM SECOND.

Footnotes
IDLE TIME was rated off the first flight along the inside in the opening half, shifted out splitting foes racing into the far turn, shifted three wide in upper
stretch advancing to challenge for command, then took over and went clear under brisk left handed pressure. BEE MAJOR, pulling inside foes in the first
flight racing into the first turn, was eased of the pace to track off those rivals between foes nearing the backstretch, shifted out three deep entering the far
turn while moving to challenge, gained the advantage nearing upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner late. FLY NIGHTLY tracked the leaders outside
rivals in second flight, conceded some position under patient handling awaiting an opening racing into the far turn, angled out six wide racing into upper
stretch and continued with interest to narrowly prevail for a share. MILBURN was settled outside a rival dropping off the second flight in the opening half,
advanced in close quarters to split rivals three wide entering upper stretch but steadily improved his position to the end. VINTNER was rated off the second
flight shifting off the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to make brief progress three wide between foes racing into the far turn but faded in the
drive. ARMANDO'S TEAM settled along the rail racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch while racing in close quarters but made no real
impact. JOY CITY joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, pressed the pace outside a rival, then between foes on the far turn and gave way
nearing midstretch. KODIAK BROWN hopped at the start while breaking slowly and never menaced thereafter. FOOD AND WINE, urged between foes,
then inside a rival disputing the pace to the far turn, gave way abruptly nearing the lane. BARREL OF STOUT settled outside foes racing to the backstretch,
was caught five wide after a half, was prompted to make some brief progress four deep entering the second bend but gave way abruptly nearing upper
stretch.

Footnotes
EASTER CHOCOLATE angled inwards sharply racing into the first turn to force the pace outside foes, went clear into the backstretch racing a bit off the
inside, dueled for command between foes when challenged racing through the far turn, then edged away in the closing stages under brisk handling. QUEEN
BOURBON angled to the inside racing into the first turn tracking off the leaders, was urged to advance along the rail on the far turn to challenge inside the
pacesetter nearing upper stretch, exchanged some light contact with that foe nearing the lane, then altered course out of tight quarters in upper stretch but
continued well enough to prevail for the place honors. BALLET SCHOOL, forwardly placed along the rail racing into the first turn, was steadied sharply
avoiding tight quarters nearing the seven furlong marker, switched outside the leaders while being urged to regain a contending position racing to the
backstretch, advanced to challenge three wide between foes entering the far turn but flattened out in upper stretch. BABY GUNDIN was steadied slightly
avoiding traffic racing into the first turn, continued off the second flight through the backstretch, angled in entering the far turn but had no closing bid. MISS
ALEX, caught in tight between foes racing into the first turn, switched outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch while being prompted to maintain a
contedning position, was caught four wide entering the far turn and steadily faded. FORBIDDEN DREAM trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE
RIDER OF BALLET SCHOOL LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ON THE FIRST TURN WHILE THE
RIDER OF QUEEN BOURBON ALSO LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING UPPER STRETCH WHILE
THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY BUT EACH CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
BALL LIGHTNING, reserved off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, conceded some position under patient handling racing into the
far turn, swung out four wide in upper stretch and produced a solid late response to wrest the advantage in time under left handed pressure. MISS
TOURISTA was settled along the inside in the opening half, shifted out splitting foes three wide entering the far turn, rallied smartly to the front in that path
racing into upper stretch, resisted the winner's challenge but couldn't fend off that rival. BEAUTY GENIUS, bumped at the start, was pulling a bit against
restraint tracking the leaders outside a rival to the backstretch, lost some position nearing upper stretch, then shifted three wide in the closing stages while
continuing with interest to narrowly prevail for a share on the wire. COOL O TOOLE, off slowly, was settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, angled to the five path in upper stretch and made some belated progress while just missing for a share. SUCCESSFUL LEGACY sped to the
lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace under firm rating on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled between foes into upper stretch and gave way
late. ATLANTIC PRINCESS tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the far turn, advanced inside foes to bid nearest the rail in upper stretch
but lacked the needed late kick. SHE DAZZLE, in touch prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue entering the far turn and gave
way into upper stretch. DIXIELAND DARLING, bumped at the start, was reserved outside foes racing to the backstretch, was caught four wide entering the
far turn and offered no rally.

Footnotes
BRICE was urged to dictate the pace on a narrow margin between foes racing to the backstretch, forged clear on the far turn and steadily extended his
advantage under a right handed tap. SILVER EDGE, forwardly placed three wide prompting the pacesetter to the backstretch, proved no match for that foe
after five furlongs, shifted inwards racing into the stretch and proved best of the others. SHAKEM N BREAKEM tracked off the second flight along the inside
racing to the backstretch, switched out three wide nearing upper stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share. PREQUALIFIED, forwardly placed
along the inside prompting the pace in the opening half, gave way racing through the far turn. BLAME BISHOP tracked the pacesetter between foes as part
of the second flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded after a half. COGAN broke through the gate before the start, was settled outside a rival
tracking off the second flight but dropped back early. MOZANO was pulled up in apparent distress racing through the first turn and was vanned off the
course.

Footnotes
SILENT JET took up a position three wide tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, advanced to challenge four wide on the far turn, gained the
advantage while shifting nearer to the inside entering the lane, was headed midstretch but responded gamely to narrowly prevail under firm handling.
DAZZLING TRUTHS tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out five wide nearing upper stretch while advancing
to challenge, struck the front midstretch but couldn't quite match the winner's kick. RUDIGER was settled in the last flight racing to the first turn, switched
outside a stricken rival racing into the backstretch, angled inside through the backstretch steadily drawing into contention, switched off the inside advancing
four wide leaving the far turn, was fanned six wide in upper stretch but continued to make mild progress while gaining a share. REGAL SPEAKER was rated
off the first flight along the inside in the opening half, saved ground awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, came through along the rail entering the lane
and continued with an effort to improve position. D'CRAZINESS settled between foes off the second flight, was fanned six wide into upper stretch but
offered no rally. SANCOCHO (MEX), urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch. ROUGH NIGHT, in
touch with the leaders three deep prompting the pace to the backstretch, gave way on the far turn. BUNSTER vied for command between foes from the
outset to the far turn and faded nearing upper stretch. MAYRHOFEN proved no factor. SMART WARRIOR was settled between foes in the last while shifting
to the inside racing into the first turn, fell to the course when suffering an apparent catastrophic injury nearing the backstretch and was vanned off the
course.
