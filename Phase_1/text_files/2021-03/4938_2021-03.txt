DOUBLETROUBLE BEAR stalked the pace from the outside, moved up three wide into the upper to take a clear lead and prevailed late under strong
handling. TOP STAR raced up close in the early stages, moved up three wide around the far turn, angled to the inside in the stretch and finished gamely
late to just miss. FEISTY BIRD was bumped at the break, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had not enough in the drive. RUN FOR MATTY stalked the
pace from the outside, moved up near the far turn towards the inside, angled five wide through the stretch and had no final bid. LAUNCHED sprinted clear in
the early stages and was empty the final eighth of a mile. RYDERS GHOST raced three wide in the stretch and never was a factor. LIL SILVER FOX
dropped back early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. SHATTERED DREAMS was slow early, saved ground and never
menaced. MIDNIGHT LEWIS failed to sustain a bid. BOLD IMPACT failed to menace. The five eighths internal fraction was unavailable.

MY BOY LOLLIPOP was unhurried early, moved up four wide in the lane and drove clear in the final stages. SUPERSERG raced up close in the early
stages, moved up along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and was no match for the winner. SONGSTER stalked the early pace, raced three
in the three path through the stretch and weakened in the latter stages. CLEAR THE NILE was unhurried early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and
never was a factor. WHITE DRILL pressed the pace and gave way. KAT DUDE was allowed to settle to middle of the pack, raced six deep at the eighth pole
and had no late response. CO CO KID dropped back early and failed to respond. CALLME MR MISTER was slow early on, raced six wide at the three
sixteenths pole and never was a factor. SLEEPY TURTLE showed good speed from the inside and tired readily.

Footnotes
FAYETTE WARRIOR pressed the early leader from the outside, took command down the backstretch and held gamely in the drive under steady handling.
SHANGHAI SKIPPER was slow early on, moved up along the inside and closed well late in the final stages. BANANA PEPPER was allowed to settle early,
moved up six wide into the upper stretch and made a good late gain. DANCE DOCTOR settled off the early pace, raced seven wide through the lane and
had not enough in the drive. DOBY stalked the early pace and had no response. BLABIMIR bobbled at the break, stalked early on and weakened.
AWESOME EMMIT failed to respond. KNIGHT DISRUPTOR showed good speed from the inside and tired readily.
