BENTLEY'S DREAM pressed the leader from the outside, took command nearing the far turn and held gamely to be well clear under steady handling.
DIRTY DIXIE ROAD stalked the pace, raced three deep down the backstretch, raced four wide through the lane and finished second best. SHE'S A LUCKY
ONE was allowed to settle in the early stages, raced along the inside in the early stages, moved up three wide in the stretch and showed good late interest.
TAYLOR'S BEAUTY set all the pace from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. GIGGLES AND SMOKE dropped back early on, raced five
wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. UNFADING BEAUTY was slow early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CABO DORADO was bumped at the break, raced up close early on, took command down the backstretch and held a clear margin under steady handling.
SEATTLE BAY pressed the pace, raced along the inside through the stretch and was no match for the winner. MISS MAGDALENA stalked the early pace,
raced three wide around the far turn through the stretch and had not enough in the drive. ZIPPORAH vied for the early lead from the inside and weakened.
DIXIE CHIP raced three wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. D L'S GIRL went to her nose at the break, settled towards the rear and never
threatened. SILENT SURPRISE raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor.
