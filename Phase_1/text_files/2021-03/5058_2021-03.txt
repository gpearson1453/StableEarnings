Footnotes
THIRTY SECONDS OUT tracked the early pace, went four wide into the second turn, was closing late and was up in time for the win. NO HARBOR IN
SIGHT set a clear early pace, raced off the rail into the turns, met the bid of SPIDER RICO into the home turn, dueled with that rival to late stretch, but
couldn't hold off the winner. SPIDER RICO chased the early pace, went three wide into the second turn, made a bid on NO HARBOR IN SIGHT, dueled to
late stretch and finished a game third. THE PUBLIC HALO stalked the early pace, raced along the inside through the home turn, angled out in early stretch,
lost path late and weakened. DYNAMITE LAD was unhurried early, angled out to the six path in early stretch and finished with a mild rally. VICTORY LANE
was taken back early, advanced between rivals and flattened out. REY COLIMAN was reserved early, went five wide into the second turn and never fired.
BASHFUL BOB was void of speed and was no factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN IN REGARDS TO THE STRETCH RUN AND
TOOK NO ACTION.
