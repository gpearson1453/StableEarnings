Footnotes
AMELIA'S BONNET off a step slow, raced back for five furlongs, advanced through the second turn, angled out three wide late turn, shifted out one more
lane to challenged the first flight approaching the furlong grounds, kicked clear while drifting in. FLAT OUT GOLD settled off the pace and the inside, two
path into the far turn, steered out to challenge three wide into the lane, raced on equal terms while inside the winner inside the furlong marker, could not
match strides late, clearly second best. BACKGATE BELLE broke back, continued to lack speed for six furlongs, came four wide into the lane, mild rally.
MARQUEE COWBOY chased the early leader, moved up inside to duel the middle half, weakened the final furlong. DANZIG STAR settled in mid pack off
the inside, two path second turn, failed to respond in the drive to finish up evenly. ELLA'S MY GIRL broke back, tucked inside to save ground first turn,
continued inside second turn, traffic late in the final turn when making a mild advance, continued to improve position to the wire. THURSDAY MORNING
broke on top, cleared in the two path in the first turn, allowed a rival up inside before a half, dueled, faltered in the drive. SPILLED PERFUME made little
impact in lacking a rally while racing inside. TYNE AFTER TYNE off a bit slow, failed to menace. CADDO QUEEN was finished early. TUESDAY forwardly
placed early off the inside, stopped.

Footnotes
EASTSIDE COOL off the early pace, three ranged up three wide to challenge turning for home, long duel to the wire,edging clear late under firm handling.
JACKMAN dueled up front closest to the inside, fell back then reengaged the other speed late in the turn, dueled a second time through the lane inside the
winner, gave ground grudgingly to that rival until late, clearly second best. SPOTTED BULL lacked early foot, staged a mild rally off the inside, chased the
top two past the furlong marker, proved no match for that pair late, narrowly saved the show. FLAT OUT AVENGER fell back to trail after the start, in the two
path through the turn, mild interest to improve position, outkicked for the show. PERFECT MISTAKE broke back, trailed well back inside, continued to save
ground turn, improved position. PAYSTER floated out start, was straightened then came in slightly midway up the backstretch, dueled up front off the inside,
gave way from between rivals entering the stretch. BODE'S LIGHT broke out, recovered to race forwardly, steadied when in a bit tight before a quarter, rank
soon after, came four wide into the lane, no kick. COPLEY remained always back. SCREEN STAR gave way after a half. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL
BY THE RIDER OF BODE'S LIGHT AGAINST PAYSTER, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

late under steady handling. STREET TOLL within striking distance along the inside, moved out a bit into the lane, challenged between horses past the
furlong marker, briefly put a head in front soon after, could not match strides with the winner late, clear for the place. BELLAMYS ROAN off a step slow,
moved up quickly to be a pace factor into the turn, clear by late in the bend, vied past the furlong marker while remaining closest to the inside, weakened
late, saved the show. SKYWAVE within striking distance while racing three wide, had little for the drive to finish up evenly. HEROIC SONG off a bit slow,
raced three wide turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat. KING HENRIK off the pace outside, four wide through the turn, failed to
muster a rally. MAJOR CHANCE broke out, was straightened to set the pace toward the inside for three furlongs, gave way when headed for the drive.
HOLDING PATTERN off slow, bothered, was never involved. DISTRACTANDATTACK was finished early.

Footnotes
MADISON'S LUNA lacked speed while racing inside, crept closer late in the turn, waited, then steadied lacking room into the stretch, split foes past the
furlong marker when rallying through traffic, dropped inside soon after and continued with good energy to be up in time. GORDY FLORIDA broke alertly,
chased the early leader off the inside, moved up to duel with that one late in the turn, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, continued to lead
late, could not contain the winner at the end while inside of that rival. IMPRESSED void of speed, raced four wide through the turn, came in the five path for
the drive, finished up best of the rest while remaining widest through the stretch. WELL CONNECTED sprinted clear soon after the start, dueled into and
through upper stretch, faltered in the final furlong. D' RAPPER in the second flight while in the two path, came up empty for the drive. CYRIL'S BOY off the
early pace while racing outside, asked for some run three path late turn, closer, then flattened out in the drive. VICE VERSA failed to menace. TOWN
CHAMP in the second flight inside, had little left for the drive.

SMARTY'S ANGEL broke in good order, moved up to show the way into the turn, clear while in hand exiting the bend, not threatened just off the inside to
the wire, kept to task. TALLANDLONG behind the leaders while along the inside, got through behind the winner turning for home, proved no match for that
one, clear for the place. VERY SPICY bumped and pushed in at the start, raced back off the pace and the inside, mild rally, finished up best of the rest. NO
DIRECT MATCHES within striking distance while four wide through the turn, lacked closing response. DAIGLE broke sharp, settled behind the pace outside,
five wide into the turn, four wide into the lane, also found lacking when the real running began at the head of the lane. CASH LIGHT with the early pace off
the inside, chased the winner through the turn in the two path, weakened in the drive. FEMININE ALLURE lacked speed, bothered, steered out to avoid
fallen rival early turn, four wide into the lane, improved slightly, no real threat. SPOT'S MAINE GIRL off a step slow, trailed, bothered by stricken foe turn,
passed tiring rivals. PRECIOUS TINKLE void of speed, remained back, bothered by a fallen rival early in the turn, remained back in the drive. FRANKIES
MOONSHINE forwardly placed early off the inside, began a steady fade before a half. CYBER SNEAKER broke in, bumped foe, raced back, bothered three
furlongs out, remained back. FAST SOPHIA broke back, moved up closer along the inside backstretch, steadied when lacking room into the turn, appeared
to clip heels then fell soon after unseating rider, walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH THE TURN, THE
RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
FRENCH ROSE in the main body in the run up the backstretch outside, five wide into the turn, loomed boldly with a strong move late in the turn, four wide
turning for home, dueled past the furlong marker, drove clear late. PICK UP THE FONE bumped at the start, moved up to duel off the inside, put that rival
just as she was challenged by the winner from the outside entering the stretch, dueled with that rival past the furlong marker then could not keep up late.
BEAUTY DAY back off the pace and the inside, continued four wide through the turn, displayed some mild late interest to be along for the show, no threat to
the top pair. ABRAMAX in the second flight just off the inside, asked along late in the turn, went evenly through the stretch to be caught late for the show
spot. SUMMER LOVIN fell back to trail after the start, came five wide out of the turn, found best stride too late down the middle of the strip. MIDNIGHT
KARMA behind the leaders inside, traffic into the turn, asked along when clear late in the bend, had little for the drive. AWESOME INDRA lacked speed,
also encountered some traffic in the turn, also came up empty when called on for the drive. FRENCH CHARM jostled at the start, raced back and failed to
menace. SATTERSFIELD off a step slow, well back while saving ground, passed tiring rivals while never a threat. JULIE ARKANSAS broke in, bumped
rival, mid pack, tired after a half. BOBBIE TOO TOO forwardly placed early while three wide, gave way in the turn. SHESHED flashed speed for a half along
the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
JOYFUL CADENCE never far back, took over inside with some encouragement into the turn, shook clear into the stretch while in hand, steadily increased
advantage under a steady right then left handed crop to the wire. MUSIC APP broke outward but sharply, showed the way up the backstretch just off the
inside, relinquished the advantage to the winner into the turn, chased that one into the stretch, proved no match, well clear of the others. SHE'S XTREMELY
HOT off a step slow, raced back off the inside, three wide into the lane, up for the show, not a threat to the top two. VILLAREGGIA lacked speed after
breaking with the field, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, improved slightly, no real threat to the top three. WINNING WALK void of speed in trailing
for a half, improved a bit while off the inside. BLAME THE RED CAT closest to the top two up the backstretch, moved out, three wide turn, tired in the drive.
ON MY OWN lacked a serious bid. MOTOWN GIRL steadily retreated while racing four wide.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN GRAYCE broke alertly, got clear before a quarter, continued to show the way through the turn, shook off a rival turning into the stretch to be
clear again, kept to task. EXOTIC WEST behind the pace while along the inside, asked along late in the turn, moved closer to the winner nearing midstretch,
could do little more with that one late, held sway for the place. AVA'S GRACE in the second flight while off the inside, closest to the winner past the furlong
marker, lacked a closing punch. PARKIN IN THE REAR chased the winner up the backstretch out in the strip, three wide early turn, moved closer and
lodged a brief bid on the outside turning for home, flattened out in the drive. EKATI'S HIT broke inward and sluggishly to spot the field a few lengths,
continued back, came four wide for the drive, improved position a bit while not a serious threat. DANA'S BEAUTY fell back after the start, failed to threaten.
SOMEONE SAID SO settled off the pace, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
SEVIER broke alertly, clear early, continued to show the way into and through the turn, maintained daylight through the late under steady handling. RARE
FORM forwardly placed from the start, chased the winner through the turn and into the lane, set down, could not get to that foe the final furlong, remained
well clear of the others. CLEAR THE MINE off the pace while racing outside, improved position without posing a serious threat. HIDDEN PROMISE broke
out, moved up closer along the inside the opening quarter, asked along turn, continued one paced through the stretch in lacking a closing kick. PAT DADDY
forwardly placed off the inside, also failed to deliver a closing punch. OMEN OF CHANGE settled in the main body just off the inside, also failed to respond
when called on. GIGGING carried out to be off slowly, void of speed, saved some ground turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. EPIC
(ARG) void of speed, four out to five wide turn, passed tiring rivals. HE'S SO ZAZZY was never a threat. UNDERCOVER LOVER off slow, remained always
back. PADDY O'DINI broke out, forwardly placed for a half three wide, gave way in the drive.
