FRAY controlled the pace inside, widened after half a mile and remained safe under moderate urging. MOUNTAIN TREE outrun early, angled inside on the
turn, swung wide in the stretch and continued willingly. WEEKEND IN COURT broke a step slowly, saved ground, moved closer on the turn but tired.
INDIRECTLY lacked speed, moved wide in the stretch and flattened out. I SAW IT ALL settled outside the leaders, was in tight tiring between rivals at the
top of the stretch and faltered. RULES stumbled at the start, pressed the pace outside, stopped and was eased in the stretch.

FREEDOM PASSAGE settled inside, angled out to secure room on the turn, rallied and edged away through the final furlong. ABOVE PAR set a clear pace
inside, was collared at the quarter pole and continued gamely to the finish regaining the place. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE made a menacing outside bid on
the turn, reached even terms in mid stretch but tired. SHATTER ME chased between rivals and weakened steadily. SEXYAMA dropped back inside and
was never in contention. SHE'S PRIMO lacked speed, was steered wide after a quarter mile and lacked a bid. POSITIVE FORCE raced close up briefly,
stopped abruptly, bled from the nostril and was eased.

stretch and got fourth. HAY BUCK raced off the rail, off the pace, went four wide on the far turn and failed to rally. TIZ A DATE stalked the pace, lacked a bid

HIBACHI rated inside, awaited room on the final turn, slipped through into the stretch and gamely outfinished outside duo. GLORY SONG hustled to the
front inside, was collared on the final turn and fought gamely to the finish. KINGSVILLE rated along the inside, angled out on the final turn, bid, earned a
brief lead but hung. SOCIETY'S TIGER broke a bit awkwardly, settled inside and rallied mildly. NAUGHTY PRINCE angled outside the pacesetter on the
first turn, vied through the final turn then gave way. ACED chased off the leaders outside and lacked a rally. THORNY TALE trailed early racing wide and
was never in contention. IRISH MEADOW dropped well behind and was always outrun. HUMOR CONTROLLER saved ground dropping back early and
faltered steadily.
