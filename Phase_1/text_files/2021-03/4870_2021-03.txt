leaders six wide on the backstretch, continued to advance four wide through the turn, shifted inwards in the drive but proved only second best. DON'T
MAKE ME BEG, forced to steady avoiding tight quarters in early stages, angled to the rail, gained contention inside foes on the turn, shifted outside the
pacesetter in upper stretch to bid bid between foes but was outkicked for second while prevailing for a share. SUGAR BRITCHES, urged between rivals
pursuing the pacesetter just off the inside racing into the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch and faded late. ASTROMELIA, bumped at the start,

Footnotes
AMBER PARADISE ducked out at the start bumping ALL GOOD TIMES, was quickly righted to gain the advantage racing four deep early, shifted inwards
dictating the pace a bit off the rail on a narrow margin between foes racing into the turn, contested the issue outside a rival into upper stretch and forged
clear late under pressure. NO MERCY PERCY, urged inside the pacesetter prompting that rival through the backstretch into the lane, proved no match late.
MOVIE MOXY tracked just off the pacesetter between foes in early stages, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued well enough to prevail
for a share. ALL GOOD TIMES broke in the air, then was bumped soundly at the start, settled last racing to the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and made
some belated progress between foes. CRUMB BUN, urged to a forward placing five wide in the opening stages, tracked just off the leaders three wide into
the turn and faded into upper stretch. BAYDAR angled to the inside early tracking off the first flight and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
LORY, off last while caught in tight quarters just after the break, was guided to the rail while being prompted to gain contention racing through the
backstretch, bid for command inside the pacesetter entering the turn, kicked away nearing upper stretch and extended the advantage in a ridden out effort.
OWEN'S PLEASURE was settled outside foes in early stages, gained some position outside foes nearing the lane, angled four wide midstretch and found
her best stride late to prevail for second. BAHAMA MISCHIEF settled well off the leaders racing to the turn, gathered momentum nearing upper stretch, split
foes along the inside late to gain position to the end while being outkicked for second. OPULENT WAYS, urged to a forward placing three wide prompting
the pace to the turn, gave way nearing the lane. FAIR GAME tracked off the first flight a bit off the inside racing to the turn, angled to the rail entering upper
stretch but had no closing bid. SUMMER HOME, urged to the lead while angling to the inside, set the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch,
bore out slightly entering the turn, was quickly righted to press the issue outside the eventual winner on the bend and gave way into upper stretch. MAGIC
RIDE settled last and proved no threat. FOR EVER OURS shifted off the inside while being urged to press the pace between foes through the backstretch
but gave way early.

Footnotes
NICENO gained a position just off the leaders while angling inwards to track those rivals between foes to the backstretch, continued under patient handling
to the far turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch and produced a sustained response to wear down foes in time under firm left handed encouragement.
WE THE CLOUDS, in touch with the pacesetter racing to the first turn, was eased off the pace to track that rival along the inside racing to the far turn, saved
ground to upper stretch, tipped out near midstretch to split foes challenging for command, struck the front between calls but just failed to contain the winner.
RAZZLEDAZZLEM, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace to the far turn, repelled a rival's challenge to go clear into upper stretch, then
continued grudgingly to late stages while just collared by the top pair late. SANSA'S VOW tracked off the second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced
three wide on the leaders to challenge nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. FIRST COURSE settled along the inside early, came through
close quarters splitting rivals racing into upper stretch, then altered course avoiding some traffic in the closing stages while finishing evenly late. GLOBAL
BRAND, reserved between foes while shifting three deep nearing the far turn, was fanned six wide into upper stretch and gained some position while
making no real imrpesssion. FOXGLOVE tracked the leader outside foes in second flight, advanced nearing the far turn to briefly press the issue but gave
way midstretch. PECHANGA (IRE) angled to the inside tracking the leaders in second flight for a half and steadily faded racing into the far turn. STORMY D
settled last to the backstretch, was guided outside foes avoiding some traffic on the backstretch but offered no rally. BLUEYED PRINCESS proved no factor.

Footnotes
LAST JUDGMENT broke readily, shifted off the rail dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, edged away racing into the far turn, held
sway to late stages and was kept to firm encouragement while proving best. MODERNIST tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the
backstretch, shifted out three wide entering upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail for the place honors. WAR STOPPER
exchanged light contact with LETMENO at the start, tracked the pacesetter inside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced
along the rail on the far turn to challenge inside foes but couldn't gain terms with the winner and was outkicked for second. LETMENO exchanged light
bumps with WAR STIOPPER at the start, was urged to gain a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, then weakened between
foes in the drive. JUNGLE FIGHTER was settled last and failed to menace.

Footnotes
UNTREATED, unhurried between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide after a half, was prompted to advance in that path
racing into the far turn, wrested the advantage nearing upper stretch and drew well clear through the stretch under firm hand urging. BIG GEORGES
KINGDM, urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the first turn, gained a narrow advantage on the backstretch, set the pace off the inside racing
into the far turn, couldn't match the winner but continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors. OH STEVE, off a step slowly, pulled his way
between foes racing through the backstretch, angled out four wide on the far turn and continued with interest to gain position into the lane. THE BEST
DISTANCE, urged to dispute the pace along the inside racing into the first turn, continued in pursuit of the leaders into the far turn and weakened nearing
the lane. SON OF THUNDER tracked off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch and continued evenly nearing the lane. DREAMING OF GERRY,
held up between foes dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, lacked a rally. SEMINOLE BEACH tracked the leaders between foes in
second flight to the backstretch and faded after a half. LAST INVESTMENT, urged to a position three deep between foes in second flight racing to the
backstretch, continued in pursuit of the leaders in that path to the second bend and emptied out into upper stretch. GANDOLFO, caught four deep in the last
flight racing to the backstretch, proved no threat. BIG VENEZUELA dropped out early.

WINFROMWITHIN broke readily, was urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch into the far turn, shook clear in
upper stretch and maintained a comfortable advantage under firm encouragement. CREW DRAGON settled between rivals behind the second flight racing
to the backstretch, split foes nearing upper stretch, angled four wide entering the lane and continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors.
BOREAS, forwardly placed three wide racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady effort between foes in that path to late stages but was outkicked for
second. BLUE CAT settled last racing to the far turn, split foes just off the inside in upper stretch advancing in close quarters and gained some position in a
belated effort. THE RIGHT STUFF (GB), in touch with the eventual winner attending the pace racing to the backstretch, pressed that rival racing into the far
turn but came up empty in the drive. PRIVATE ISLAND delayed proceedings when requiring an equipment adjustment prior to the start, settled outside foes
in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was caught five wide racing through the far turn but offered no rally. WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight racing to the far turn, angled to the inside entering upper stretch but faded late. TAPWOOD tracked the leaders three
wide between rivals in second flight to the backstretch and faded after a half. HEAT OF THE NIGHT, caught four wide in second flight to the backstretch,
continued in that path to the second bend and retreated nearing the lane. CASTLE KING tracked off the second flight inside foes to the far turn but offered
no rally. COMEDY TOWN angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking just off the first flight to the backstretch and faded after a half.

FIRE MARSHALL BILL angled to the inside early tracking behind the second flight, shifted out on the turn gaining momentum, split foes with a sharp move
while angling to the four path in upper stretch and continued with a sustained response to bid for command three deep between foes in the closing stages
and just wrested a narrow advantage in time under firm handling. UNCORK THE BOTTLE was settled last racing to the turn, swung to the six path in upper
stretch and produced his best stride late to close the gap while just prevailing for second. SUN SQUALL tracked the leaders outside foes in the second flight
racing to the turn, angled to the five path nearing upper stretch and continued willingly four wide between foes to prevail for a share while just outkicked.
FLORIDA TWO STEP, urged to gain the lead shifting a bit off the rail racing through the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival into upper stretch
and was collared late. SPEEDING KID, caught six wide in early stages, steadily advanced five wide nearing the turn, moved to challenge for command
nearing the midway point of the bend while shifting inwards, held a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum. RITMO
DE CUECA (ARG), urged between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, faded into upper stretch. RATTLESNAKE RIDGE, urged
four wide between foes prompting the pace to the turn, gave way nearing the lane. MINNESOTA LUCKY tracked off the first flight between foes racing to
the turn and emptied out nearing the lane. LAST PROMISE, off awkwardly, angled to the rail early while prompted to a position in the second flight but faded
after a half. MR. ANKENY vied briefly for command three wide between foes and gave way racing into the turn.

MICHELINE, a bit reluctant to load, raced four deep in the opening stages, shifted inwards leaving the chute to track off the first flight outside a rival to the
backstretch, shifted out three deep nearing upper stretch to challenge for command and produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage from
between foes under firm handling. MORNING MOLLY shifted inwards in the opening stages to gain terms with the pacesetter attending that rival's tempo
under light rating racing to the far turn, pressed the issue racing into upper stretch to gain the advantage, couldn't match the winner late but prevailed for the
place honors. NEW YORK GIRL (IRE) tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, shifted three deep nearing the second bend, was
prompted to advance four wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly between foes to close the gap while prevailing for a share. LA SIGNARE
(FR) angled inwards leaving the chute to track off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out awaiting an opening nearing upper
stretch, then was prompted to split foes three deep gaining position in the closing stages. MISS TEHERAN (IRE), reserved outside a rival tracking well off
the leaders racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum switching outside foes on the far turn, swung five wide entering upper stretch and finished
willingly gaining position to the end. COUNTERPARTY RISK (IRE) angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking just off the pacesetter, saved ground
on the far turn, came through along the rail to bid for command inside foes in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. MAGIC ATTITUDE (GB) was
rated along the inside while pulling against restraint racing to the backstretch, continued near the inside into the far turn, shifted out to race three wide
between foes entering the lane and made some belated progress. HOW IRONIC settled with a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch and failed to
menace. COURT RETURN settled in the last flight racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. MYHARTBLONGSTODADY, urged to dictate the pace on
a narrow margin along the inside from the outset to the far turn, dueled for command between foes into upper stretch and gave out late.

DOMAIN EXPERTISE angled inwards to track off the second flight between foes under light rating racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep on the
far turn while being prompted to advance, shifted inwards entering upper stretch while steadily advancing on the pacesetter and just collared that rival in
time under firm handling. JOUSTER sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin to upper stretch, was roused to widen the
advantage midstretch but just failed to contain the winner. OYSTER BOX broke out bumping FORECER BOSS, was reserved well out of striking distance
near the inside in the opening half, angled out four wide entering upper stretch and continued willingly to prevail for a share. MIA MARTINA was settled last
near the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out to split foes entering upper stretch, then angled five wide in the closing stages to make some belated
progress. QUEEN OF THE GREEN angled to the inside early tracking the pace behind the second flight, saved ground on the far turn, shifted out in upper
stretch to split foes while caught in tight quarters racing past the furlong marker but continued to improve position between foes to the end. BE SNEAKY
tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the far turn, then faded three deep between foes racing into upper stretch. FLIGHT TO SHANGHAI angled
inside to track the pacesetter inside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the far turn and came up empty entering upper stretch. FOREVER BOSS,
bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the far turn, was caught four wide nearing the lane and steadily faded. BIG BAND
LUZZIANN, urged to a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter, continued in pursuit of that foe to upper stretch and abruptly gave out. ALEX'S FIRST
settled near the inside early and proved no threat.

Footnotes
HELIUM, unhurried outside foes racing to the backstretch, shifted five wide after a half advancing on the leaders, moved to challenge for command in that
path midway through the far turn, gained the advantage while angling to the inside racing into upper stretch and held safe the challenge of HIDDEN STASH
under left handed pressure. The latter was settled three wide between foes racing to the backstretch, switched out five deep on the far turn advancing to
contention, loomed outside the winner nearing midstretch but was outkicked. MOONLITE STRIKE, in touch with the leader attending the pace racing to the
backstretch, came under pressure between foes racing through the far turn, continued on his own courage momentarily when caught in close quarters
nearing upper stretch, shifted out sharply crossing into the path of PROMISE KEEPER entering the lane and kept on with a willing effort to prevail for a
share. UNBRIDLED HONOR settled in the last flight while angling nearer the inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes entering the far turn,
angled to the five path in upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position to the end. KING OF DREAMS angled to the inside tracking just off the
pacesetter in the opening half, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. AWESOME GERRY tracked off the second flight between foes
racing to the backstretch, lost position to the leaders entering the second bend, then shifted out six wide in upper stretch to improve his placing late. SITTIN
ON GO settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. BOCA BOY sped to the lead along the inside, set the pace on a
narrow margin racing into the far turn and gave out once headed racing into upper stretch. MY LIBERTY, getting out a bit tracking off the second flight inside
foes racing to the backstretch, dropped out early. SUPER STRONG settled near the inside racing to the backstretch and steadily faded on the far turn.
CANDY MAN ROCKET, off a step behind rivals, was rated out of striking distance while shifting out on the first turn, was prompted to advance four wide
between foes after a half, lodged a brief bid between foes in that path entering the far turn but came up empty racing into upper stretch. PROMISE KEEPER
bobbled at the start, recovered quickly, then was prompted to a forward placing, tracked just off the leader three deep as part of the second flight racing to
the far turn, was urged to make a brief bid between foes entering the far turn, came up empty nearing upper stretch, then was steadied out of tight quarters
while giving way.

Footnotes
REINA DEL SOL, prompted to a forward placing while angling inwards in the opening stages, steadied momentarily entering the first turn, angled to the rail
racing to the backstretch tracking the leaders, was prompted with a sharp move to split foes challenging the pacesetter entering the far turn, went clear and
was kept to firm encouragement to maintain a safe advantage to the end. BALLACOLLA tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the
backstretch, shifted outside foes after a half, then continued with a steady late response racing four wide into the lane to prevail for the place honors late.
BIG BEE angled to the inside tracking just off the second flight in early stages, was prompted to advance in close quarters just after a half, split foes just off
the inside racing into upper stretch continuing with a steady bid and just missed for second. TRANQUILLINA carried out a bit racing into the first turn gaining
a position just off the leaders, was prompted to advance three wide into the far turn, continued in that path between foes to upper stretch but had no late
kick. YOUENS, forced out avoiding traffic entering the first turn, tracked off the second flight racing three wide into the second bend, then continued in that
path to late stages but had no rally. LISHEEN settled while working her way to the inside racing to the first turn, was urged to make a sharp advance along
the rail midway through the backstretch, steadied out of tight quarters entering the second bend and quickly came up empty. JEAN V'S LEGACY settled
near the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out to race between foes nearing upper stretch but offered no rally. TURNING POINT, forced wide avoiding
traffic racing into the first turn, never gained contention. NABRUZZI settled between foes in early stages and proved no threat. LADY CUILINN (IRE) settled
last to the far turn and proved no factor. BOURBON ROYALE sprinted to the lead racing to the first turn, bore out momentarily on that bend, was righted to
maintain a commanding advantage through the backstretch but gave way abruptly once headed entering the far turn. FANNY, urged to a forward placing
pursuing the pacesetter into the backstretch, gave way after a half. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
INCIDENT ON THE FAR TURN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
