STRIKE APPEAL stalked the pace looming through the far turn, engaged abreast foe in upper stretch needing full extension to clear late. LAST DROP OF
WINE away alertly set the pace being hooked on the rail in upper stretch hanging tough the final eighth battling to the end. DISCLOSURE tracked the pace
chasing on the far turn, showing as no match for the top pair down the lane remained responsive out dueling rival from the inside to gain third. LEVANTO
(ARG) stalked the pace gaining ground in pursuit on the far turn, extending four wide down the lane would come up short. ARTEMUS EAGLE played no
factor. VAN DAMME was never involved. FLEET IRISH showed little. ATTUCK raced mid pack fading on the far turn.

CAN I GO TOO veered in squeezing foe at the break, raced evenly in mid pack coming four wide to upper stretch angling inside while surging clear ilate.
LEJEUNE was shut off checking at the break, would lag near the back racing wide to upper stretch rallying late in the seven path. SWEET EMPIRE pressed
through the turn shaking clear near mid track in upper stretch before faltering late. WACKER'S GIRL slow early was well back on the turn, responded with
belated stride down the lane gaining after the fact. GLORIOUS GLITTER a step slow through the turn mounted a rally to bid in upper stretch before wilting
late. CAROLINA'S THING gave hard pursuit through the turn wearing out in upper stretch. MINE ALONE worked the pace through the turn before giving
way in upper stretch. GOODGOLLY MISMOLLY flashed early speed then faded on the turn. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF LEJEUNE AGAINST
THE RIDER OF CAN I GO TOO FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE BREAK WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
DISTORTEDATTHEBAR pressed on the turn extending three deep in upper stretch edging clear gamely. IRISH CAT pressed the pace dueling to upper
stretch extending inside of foe late being out gamed. JUST FLASHY pressed a narrow lead through the turn digging in along the inside in upper stretch
ceding grudgingly at the end. UNBRIDLED BOILER raced mid pack to upper stretch putting in a late bid. O'PRADO PERK slow early gained to bid in upper
stretch finishing evenly. REBEL ROAD a step slow gave a mild move to upper stretch gaining then holding position. INDEPENDENT INDY played no factor.
MARRIAGE COUNSELOR was never involved. CELTIC LINE raced mid pack through the turn then faded in upper stretch. ADIOS JUDITH pressed the
pace to mid turn then tired into upper stretch. SUPER BEAU was always outrun.
