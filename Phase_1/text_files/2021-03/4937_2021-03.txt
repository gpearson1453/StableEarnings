Footnotes
JADE'S CLASSY ONE went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, idled while four wide early on the far turn as MULETRAIN made a strong run
to pass, gathered momentum nearing the quarter-pole then shifted five wide, rallied outside in the stretch and closed strongly to get up late. YANKEE
CLIPPER bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, set the clear pace on the inside, was asked late on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the
crop, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was denied while able to get a share of the place. MULETRAIN checked when BABE REED came out in
front early, went around the first turn in the two path, moved out near the five-eighths then dropped back in around the half-mile pole, brushed with a rival
while advancing leaving the backstretch, raced inside to the two path while making a strong run on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, chased the
leader into the final sixteenth, bumped multiple times with PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN nearing the wire and shared the place. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN was
slammed into at the start and forced in behind horses then checked, spotted the front many lengths, rounded the first turn in the two path, moved out near
the five-eighths, settled well back in the field, was urged four wide on the far turn, rallied into the final furlong, closed fast into the final sixteenth, lacked room
late then bumped multiple times with MULETRAIN and narrowly missed the trifecta in a very tough trip. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT checked when a foe came out
in front early, went three wide on the first turn, drifted in early on the backstretch, settled well back in the field, was urged while moving from the two path to
the four path on the far turn and improved position. TENCENTSUPERHOOP raced well back in the field, went three wide on the turns and failed to threaten.
GREY SLOAN broke in then was corrected by the rider, bumped with a foe while carried out into the first turn, was caught six wide on that bend, settled on
the outside, was urged six wide on the far turn then carried out in upper stretch and capitulated. DEGRASSE bumped with a foe while carried out into the
first turn, went five wide on that bend, settled off the pace, brushed with an opponent leaving the backstretch, went three then two wide on the far turn and
failed to respond. JOEBOY bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground on the first turn, moved out midway down the backstretch, dropped back while
four then three wide on the far turn and had nothing left. STEALING APRIORITY went three wide on the first turn, followed the solo leader from second, was
urged four then five wide on the far turn and also had nothing left. TENSAS GOLD broke in and bumped hard with a foe, went three wide on the first turn,
was taken back entering the backstretch, came up empty after a half-mile and faltered. BABE REED became very rank when taken in hand early then came
out while wrestled back, went three wide on the first turn, was through after a half-mile and also faltered.

TAKE THAT FOR DATA went three wide on the first turn, was rated while stalking the pace, drew even with the leader while let out at the five-eighths, vied
four then three wide on the far turn, dueled with GATO AMERICANO in the stretch, disposed of that foe late and gamely prevailed under strong urging.
GOOD INTENT saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer while two then three wide early on the far turn, was roused at the
five-sixteenths, chased into upper stretch, dropped in near the furlong marker, gained into the final sixteenth and just missed while able to get the place.
GATO AMERICANO was hustled from the start, went four wide on the first turn, moved up near the five-eighths then tracked the pace, made a bid under
urging while five then four wide on the far turn, dueled with the runner-up into the final sixteenth and was outfinished but earned the show. TWO MIKES N
DOC G went three wide on the first turn, checked off heels late on that bend, settled down the backstretch, went three then four wide on the far turn, was
roused near the five-sixteenths, chased outside in the stretch and finished willingly but missed the trifecta. LEAD STAR went five wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went four wide on the far turn, moved out under a drive inside the furlong marker and
also finished willingly. THETRASHMANSCOMING was taken up between horses early, went four wide on the first turn, settled well back in the field, rounded
the far turn in the two path and was no factor. MOSTA FLYIN lugged out a bit into the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, contested the pace,
lugged out three wide into the far turn then dropped to the rail and tired. OVER FUNDED went two to three wide on the turns and showed little. CANDIZAR
went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged six wide on the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
STROLLIN THE BAYOU checked while in tight between horses early then moved in, checked again while off heels shortly thereafter, went four wide on the
first turn, was reserved on the outside, traveled around the far turn in the three path, was roused six wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed
strongly to get the lead just inside the furlong marker then moved clear under a hand ride. MALIBU MOIRA went three wide on the first turn, settled towards
the rear, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and finished with good energy for the place. SENSIBLE MYTH went three wide on the first turn,
settled off the pace, raced in the two path on the far turn, was asked nearing the five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, shifted further out
around the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. THREEWICKEDWISHES rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at
the back, went four wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and improved position to just miss the show. ZABAVA saved ground on the first
turn, settled towards the rear, went three wide on the far turn, swung nine wide into the stretch and also improved position but missed the show. SKYVALUE
was sent hard to the lead, raced in the three path on the first turn, set the clear pace, vied inside on the far turn, was given her cue near the five-sixteenths,
turned into the stretch in the two path then shook off a challenger under the crop, lost the advantage to the winner just inside the furlong marker and
weakened. NORTH OF EDEN went around the first turn in the two path, settled near the middle of the field, saved ground on the far turn and lacked the
needed response. AS FAST AS YOU CAN rounded the first turn in the two path, was rated off the pace, went two then three wide while let out on the far
turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, spun five wide into the stretch then came in some, dropped back while drifting out into the final furlong and came
up empty. EMMPORT was hustled from the start, raced inside on the first turn, moved out entering the backstretch, tracked the pace on the outside, chased
three then four wide on the far turn and faded. (Rail at 25 Feet)

Footnotes
SIR GIANNIS settled off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead just inside the
furlong marker, leapt over tracks seventy yards from the wire and prevailed under strong urging. SOMETIMES ALWAYS broke a half-step slow, was coaxed
along on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, made a bid in upper stretch, kept on well in the final furlong but was outfinished while clear for the place.
FLAGS UP was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch, battled into
the final furlong and weakened but just held the show. FILIPPO set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead under
a drive in upper stretch and tired. SCARY LARRY broke a half-step slow, was urged along off the pace, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed kick. SAINT GOAR was coaxed along on the inside of a rival, rounded the turn in the two path while needing a little extra
left-rein guidance, was put to the crop after turning into the stretch and came up empty. FERRYBOAT was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths,
saved ground at the rear and failed to threaten. PEEKER CINCO broke out and was off a couple of lengths slow, went six wide on the turn and was no
factor.

Footnotes
GUITAR TRIBUTE was tossing his head when the latch was sprung and broke very slow, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged four
then five wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch, angled out around the three-sixteenths, rallied on the far outside in the final furlong and closed
with a rush to get up late in a huge effort. THE MO U NO had a shoe repaired in the paddock, was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the inside,
lost the advantage under the crop in upper stretch, dug in gamely to regain the lead inside the furlong marker, led until near the wire but was denied while
able to get the place. SYDSTER went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch
and finished willingly for the show. UNRESTRICTED was hustled from the start, went four wide early on the first turn then dropped to the two path, settled
off the pace, was urged along while inside on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong, moved in around the sixteenth-pole
and also finished willingly. DREWCITABLE jostled with a rival early, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, went three wide on the far
turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and improved position. PAPA'S BOY broke in and bumped with a foe, went three wide on the first turn, settled off
the pace, raced three wide on the far turn, moved closer late on that bend, came four wide into the stretch then took the lead at the three-sixteenths, led
under a drive into the final furlong then lost the advantage back to the runner-up and weakened. STUCK IN VEGAS was carried in at the start then jostled
with a foe, went around the turns in the two path, swung six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. POWER JET was bumped hard at the
start then forced into another foe and off a bit slow, moved out early, went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, went four wide under urging
on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and never reached contention. SOCIAL AFLEET was bumped hard at the start, saved ground while off the
pace, passed the five-sixteenths in the two path and failed to threaten. FREEDOMFI went three to four wide on the turns and was no factor. MANGELSEN
raced in the three path on the first turn, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired.
