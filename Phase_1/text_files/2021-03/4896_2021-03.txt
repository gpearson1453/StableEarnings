Footnotes
CARSON CITY TRAIN veered in, fired. MS LORI DARLIN big contention throughout. VALIANT TEMPTRESS worked hard between foes. CAN staggering
start, came on. ICE EAGLE clean trip. BAJA JESSY no mishap. SEND SUCCESS in early mix, faded. MAGNA MOON acted up in gate, the flipping rig
impacted the gate opening and he was off very slowly. DE ALLI CAP reared, broke far behind, and the flipping rig impacted gate opening. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START. AFTER REVIEWING VIDEO AND SPEAKING WITH ALL THE INVOLVED PARTIES, THE STEWARDS
RULED THAT BOTH MAGNA MOON AND DE ALLI CAP WERE OFFICIAL STARTERS, AS EACH CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS AS THE FIELD WAS
DISPATCHED.
