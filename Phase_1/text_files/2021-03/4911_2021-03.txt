Footnotes
NINA EN FUEGO assumed command of the early pace, was allowed to settle down the backstretch while maintaining the lead along the two path, kicked
clear along the turn and won under steady urging. HOLY ZAGS had no early speed, saved ground at the rear of the field, found running room at the top of
the stretch and passed tired horses to get second. TORQUAY was fanned four wide going into the first turn, maintained that wide trip through backstretch
going, was four wide coming off of the second turn and finished evenly for third. MAGICAL PATH had no early speed, advanced position along the
backstretch, three wide along second turn, and tired in the final stages. SCHERZO (GB) stalked pace, was between horses in the two path along the second
turn, and was empty for the stretch drive. FIRE DIAMONDS sat just off of the early pace while maintaining a ground saving trip, was asked for run at the
head of the stretch and weakened.

MAYBE I WILL sat off the early leader while maintaining a four wide trip around the turn, circled the field at the head of the stretch and kicked clear. BOLD
MISTRESS assumed early command, was confronted heading into the turn, came three wide off of the turn and finished evenly for second. AUSTRIAN
NAVY settled at the rear of the field while still close in the early stages, slipped to the rail for the run along the turn and passed tired rivals for third.
STARLIGHT STROLL sat off early pace while saving ground along the rail, put a head in front at the top of the stretch but faded. DO YOU HEAR THAT was
close to the early pace, had to check heading into the turn, chased the leader from the two path on the turn and weakened.
