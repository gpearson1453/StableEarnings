PAY GRADE forwardly placed after the start just off the inside, ranged up to take command with five and a half furlongs to run, showed the way in hand
shaking safely clear into the turn and through the bend patiently handled until placed to coaxing at the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
roused for the stretch drive, drew off under a drive and was under vigorous hand urging through the final sixteenth to the finish. STORMI CAT LADY chased
two to three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch proving no
match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. SWEET FRANNY LU chased two to three wide down the backstretch
before tucking inside with half a mile remaining, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and improved position
to procure the show honors. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled out four wide into upper
stretch and weakened. SEAHORSE D'ORO four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along near the five-sixteenths and angled out four wide into upper
stretch, then tired in the drive. KNOW IT ALL RED coaxed from the gate to establish the front shortly after the start, showed the way three paths off the
inside briefly before being displaced from command by the eventual winner nearing five and a half furlongs to go, tucked to the two path through the turn
and got put to coaxing midway, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
KING OF AMERICAN away without apparent mishap, pursued the pace from the two path, was put to a brisk hand ride springing from the half mile pole, felt
the whip a furlong down the road, flashed some interest as six furlongs was being rattled off, angled out five wide into the stretch and took off after the ones
to catch, displayed good momentum finishing off the run leading up to and then through the furlong grounds, closed in relentlessly, nailing ICY DUDE in the
shadow of the wire. ICY DUDE procured a forward position after suffering some contact with VITESSE right after the field had been released, sat within
striking distance three wide, was still being held in reserve taking over as the third fraction was being finalized, extended his lead out to its largest margin
from upper to midstretch, was let out a notch for the last eighth, best-described as being ridden out, got reeled in near the end by the strong closer. TRUE
BLUE GIANT forwardly placed while taking the inside route, stepped into the lane, tipped out during the stretch drive, stayed on well in the final stages to
save the show. VITESSE bumped with the second place finisher after bobbling at the break, departed the pace three wide, was ridden into the stretch,
lacked the necessary response. ORAZIO established the top in short, showed the way from along the rail, proved no match when confronted by ICY DUDE
at the quarter pole, backed away steadily down the stretch after yielding. KINGFISH prompted the pace from the two path until the end of the bend, shifted
out into the four path early during the stretch run while giving way.

Footnotes
ROYAL SUSPECT chased three to four paths off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, went four to five wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun three wide for home, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong latching on inside the eighth pole, had TAPIZEARANCE come
out under a near sided stick a sixteenth from home and was bumped and carried out two paths but gamely got up in the last jumps despite it to prevail on
the wire. TAPIZEARANCE chased three then four wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and took narrow command inside
that station before spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and a near sided stick coming under threat through the final furlong,
came out a sixteenth from home bumping and carrying his main danger out two paths but was nailed in the final strides to the finish regardless of the
contact while safe for the place honors. LIAM'S FIRE broke in at the start brushing BLOOD MOON and was corrected, chased two then three wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, took brief and narrow command at the five-sixteenths before being headed by the aforementioned foe inside that station,
took the inside route into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. FREAKY STYLEY chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. BETA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, came
under pressure from a pair midway on the turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and yielded the front at that station, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and weakened. PROMO CODE three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled out five wide into upper
stretch and tired. IMPERIO D chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. BLOOD
MOON got brushed at the start by the inwards breaking LIAM'S FIRE, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch, then went five to six wide
through the turn, continued six wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
TENDERFOOT set up in the two path, was involved in a duel with MUSICAL AMERICA right from the get-go, raced as a team on near even terms for
three-quarters, was coming up to the three-sixteenths pole when called upon for more, wrested away the lead from a stubborn foe then kicked clear in the
final seventy yards. MUSICAL AMERICA remained along stationed on the inside route after the start, got hooked up in a protracted tussle with the winner,
was put to a drive at the quarter pole, got headed at the beginning of the final furlong, fought on stubbornly before getting shaken off deep stretch. PER
CAPITA forwardly placed three wide for the opening six furlongs, held the show. CHESTERTOWN at the back of the pack on the backstretch, went by
SUNNY RIDGE working a tuck into the two path at the top of the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, got outkicked. SUNNY RIDGE
slid over to the rail approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, displayed no interest when put to the whip at the half mile pole, swung out very wide
under a protective hold then remained thus so earning the final check, walking off the track afterwards without need of outside assistance.

THERISASTORMBREWIN established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand along the inside, shook away through the latter portion of the
turn taking the inside route into upper stretch, got roused straightened away and went clear under a drive to prevail. MY FIRST GRAMMY chased just off the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside for home, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place
honors. HALSTAAT four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun
just off the inside for home and passed tired rivals in the stretch. SOCIAL GROUP chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. BREITHORN broke in at the start bumping PIER FORTY, chased four
then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened. ASK NEAL five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened. PIER FORTY bumped at the
start by BREITHORN, who broke inwards, chased two to three wide until tucked inside at the half mile pole, got coaxed along midway on the turn, spun two
to three wide into upper stretch and tired. AMISTAD five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired.

NINTH HOUR out-broke the competition, cut over to the rail maintaining the advantage in short order, showed the way, feeling some pressure from the
second place finisher to the outside, got let out when put to the test by that opponent right around the three-sixteenths pole, proved up to the task at hand
and drew away smartly. PROFESSOR SNAPE pressed the winner from the two path, issued up a challenge after settling in at the head of the stretch,
proved no match, saved second. RELEASETHETHUNDER went over to the rail once on the turn, came under a ride spinning into the stretch, angled into
path four, missed out on second. KOSCIUSZKO lost his tooting springing from the starting gate, abandoned the rail coming up to midpoint on the turn,
shifted out three wide at the top of the lane, got outfinished. HAWAIIAN NOISES three wide onto the turn, got sent out into path five exiting it, had no
offering. WIN WITH PRIDE took up position in the two path after losing its footing at the start, was firmly rated until the three-eighths pole, fanned out into
path six from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, launched no bids.

THREE TWO ZONE six then five paths off the inside down the backstretch prompting the leader to the outside, tucked three wide through the turn coming
under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, advanced to take over narrow command near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, edged
clear under a drive kept to task. JOHNNY SACK four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch
and ran on to secure the place honors. RETURN THE RING chased three paths off the inside until tucked to the inside half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. DOCTOR K established the front and showed the way in
hand just off the inside under pressure from a pair, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under increasing pressure from a pair three furlongs out, got
headed for command inside that station, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. BY GEORGE prompted the pace between foes four to five paths
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn advancing to take narrow command just inside the three-eighths under coaxing,
got headed near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. WELLMAN stumbled badly at the start popping the rider briefly from
the off side iron when taken hold recovering and conceded five to six lengths to the front, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch detached at
the tail of the field, went three wide through the turn, cornered three to four wide into upper stretch trailing throughout and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
BUSTIN BAY vied as the widest of three from path three until the end of the bend, took charge when given her cue at the three-sixteenths pole, came out
slightly from left side pressure for a few strides in midstretch, recovered afterwards to proceed on a fairly straight course and scampered away.
DOYOUKNOWWHOIAM grabbed a narrow advantage, showed the way forced to fend of a pair of opponents from the outside, pulling on the left, got
overpowered when the winner was itself called upon in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, had enough stretch energy to save second. VIVE LA
LIBERTY argued for command from path two in between rivals until the quarter pole, having already been roused prior to arriving at that station, stepped
into the lane and came up empty. FORTUNE'S SISTER sluggish on the backstretch, raced primarily from the two path, wound up trailing throughout.
