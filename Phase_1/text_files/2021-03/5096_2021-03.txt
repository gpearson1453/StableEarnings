Footnotes
MONDAY'S WITH MIKE tracked off the first flight five wide, then four wide racing through the backstretch, was prompted to advance in tandem with SIXTY
ONE four deep entering the turn, shifted inwards racing into upper stretch disputing the issue outside that foe and edged forward to a clear advantage late
under firm right handed pressure. SIXTY ONE, pulling between rivals while shifting inwards to track off the first flight in the opening stages, shifted out three
deep nearing the turn to bid for command between foes, shifted to the rail disputing the issue inside the winner past midstretch but proved only second best.
NEW SOUTH, prominent between foes from the break dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, dueled for command between foes into the turn and gave
way nearing upper stretch. PACIFIC LEGEND ducked inwards at the start, was urged inside rivals through the backstretch to press the pace into the turn
but gave way after a half. STRIKING MIKE, held up avoiding close quarters momentarily leaving the chute, tracked off the second flight just off the inside
racing into the turn and continued evenly into the lane. CAPTAIN LIO flashed brief pace four wide between foes in the opening quarter but gave way early.
LORD DARNLEY broke in the air, then shied inwards at the start while getting away last and failed to menace thereafter. WILD CHASE settled last on the
backstretch and failed to menace. IS IT BY CHANCE, caught six wide in the opening quarter, soon retreated.

Footnotes
MOBEATYABAD, urged inside a rival disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing through the backstretch, shook clear midway through turn and
widened the advantage to the end under steady pressure. LARGE tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening stages, was prompted to advance
three wide into the turn, couldn't gain terms with the winner but proved best of the others. TITHED tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the
turn, made brief progress to gain some position inside foes on the bend, faded leaving midstretch and switched out late while just lasting for a share.
JUSTLYREWARDED settled along the inside early, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. ACTION WARRIOR dropped out early. HAIL
SOUTHERN angled inwards to prompt the pace outside the eventual winner racing to the turn and gave way between foes in upper stretch. TEDDY'S
HONOR tracked off the second flight four wide in early stages and retreated entering the turn.

Footnotes
CONCRETE CHARLIE was rated along the inside tracking off the first flight into the first turn, switched off the inside conceding some position under patient
handling after a half, was prompted to advance three wide into the far turn, was carried out five wide in upper stretch but produced a steady late response in
a prolonged drive to just edge ANALYZEYOURVISION in time under firm left handed pressure. The latter, forwardly placed along the inside racing to the
first turn, conceded the lead to track the pacesetter inside foes racing to the far turn, tipped out to the three path advancing to challenge in upper stretch,
gained a brief advantage late but was collared at the wire. SWIFT KID angled to the inside while reserved off the second flight racing to the first turn, made a
steady advance to contention inside foes racing into upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. WILD ENOUGH, urged three deep between foes
leaving the chute to challenge for command, went clear while angling to the rail racing into the backstretch, held sway through the far turn to upper stretch
shifting a bit off the inside but yielded between foes late. SHIPWRECK, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half,
faded into the stretch. PASCAL settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled four wide entering upper stretch but had no rally. IT'S ME AGAIN
prompted to gain a contending position racing three deep between foes to the backstretch, advanced nearing the far turn to lodge a brief bid but gave way
racing into upper stretch. ALPERES, reserved early, proved no threat. SUNNY SAINT, pulling against restraint racing four wide through the first turn to the
backstretch, was through after a half.

Footnotes
JUPITER BLUES broke sharply, dictated the pace outside rivals through the backstretch, forged clear racing into the bend remaining a bit off the rail and
was kept to pressure. ADIOS SENOR, carried inwards by STERLING ICE in the opening stages, switched out after the opening furlong, was steadied
momentarily between foes leaving the half mile marker dropping off the second flight, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch and produced a steady
late response to prove best of the others. TINKER'S PAL tracked the pacesetter outside rivals as part of the second flight, continued in pursuit of the
pacesetter to upper stretch but faded late. DENY tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved ground on the turn, then tipped out in the closing
stages while continuing evenly. STERLING ICE, bumped from both sides at the start, angled in sharply while being urged to prompt the pace in the opening
three sixteenths, tracked the pacesetter inside a rival into the turn and proved empty in the drive. EAGLE KEEPER tracked off the second flight racing four
wide into the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. STRETCH RUNNER broke out bumping STERLING ICE, was settled inside a rival and failed to
menace. TOMMY TUESDAY broke inwards bumping STERLING ICE and dropped out early.

Footnotes
EL TOTO was rated between rivals in the opening stages, angled to the inside midway through the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, tipped out in
upper stretch, exchanged bumps while shifting out three wide in the closing stages and just edged TIO BLAS on the wire under firm right handed pressure.
The latter angled to the rail racing to the first turn tracking off the second flight, made a steady advance inside foes racing into the far turn, came out entering
upper stretch to wrest a narrow advantage from between foes, resisted the winner's bid to the end and just missed. DIVINE CONTROL tracked just off the
leader along the inside in the opening stages, shifted out three wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance, was fanned four wide while
exchanging bumps with the eventual winner in late stages and was just outkicked by the top pair. O'HAIRE, caught four wide racing to the backstretch
tracking off the second flight, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but had no rally. REALTOR DANNY D sped clear while angling to the rail, dictated the
pace on a clear advantage to upper stretch and gave out leaving the furlong marker. NIP OF BOURBON tracked the pacesetter between foes as part of the
second flight racing to the backstretch but faded early. ALVARADO switched out pursuing the pacesetter into the backstretch and gave way nearing upper
stretch. ADIOS BOBBY, reserved early, offered no rally. PARADE GRAND, caught three wide between foes racing to the backstretch, dropped out early.
CHANNEL MAN trailed throughout.

Footnotes
IRISH MAJOR angled to the rail racing to the first turn to track off the first flight, saved ground on the far turn steadily advancing on the leader, bid for
command entering upper stretch, then went clear through the closing stages under firm encouragement. NICOLE MUNNINGS angled inwards racing to the
first turn while sprinting to the lead, held sway on a narrow advantage a bit off the rail racing into the far turn but couldn't contain the winner in the drive while
narrowly prevailing for the place honors. TIP SHEET switched outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, was prompted in pursuit of that foe three
deep through the backstretch into the far turn and weakened entering the lane. WHISTLE ME HOME, forwardly placed along the rail in the opening stages,
shifted out after the opening quarter to make a brief bid between foes, conceded some position nearing the second bend and faded into upper stretch.
UNSPOILED MOMENTS settled last to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and made a belated effort to improve position. SIX CIDER tracked
the pacesetter three deep between foes to the first turn, was held up avoiding close quarters entering the backstretch, angled inwards after a half while
being prompted to advance but had no closing response. ROLLER settled between foes racing to the backstretch and never gained contention.
HERECOMESYOURMAN, caught four wide in second flight racing to the backstretch while being prompted to contend, faded after a half. TWO STEP
SLEW, off a step slowly, settled between foes and proved no threat.

MR. WHO, tracked off the second flight outside a rival under light reserve to the backstretch, shifted three wide leaving the midway point of the far turn while
coming under pressure to advance, continued willingly in that path through the stretch and wore down the leader to go clear in time under firm handling.
LION CHARMER was urged to force the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, dueled with that rival through the far turn past midstretch, edged
forward between calls in the closing stages but couldn't contain the winner. FORTYEIGHTSTRAIGHT angled to the inside leaving the chute to track behind
the second flight racing to the far turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share. TRUE GRACE angled
to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch while being prompted to advance but was outkicked.
AGRIPINO, urged along the rail disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, dueled for command to midstretch and gave out. FLEETRIDGE settled
outside foes racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. RED HOOD, forwardly placed three wide in the opening stages, shifted in to track the leaders
outside a rival as part of the second flight to the far turn but faded in late stages. IN HONOR OF ARTIE settled between foes racing to the backstretch and
proved no threat. INSIDER TRADING settled along the inside racing to the backstretch and had no closing response. VICTORY TOUR was off last and
never threatened thereafter.

RIDE INTO THE SKY, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, shifted off the rail racing into upper stretch and edged clear under
firm right handed pressure. FOURTH DESIGN angled inwards tracking off the first flight racing through the backstretch, shifted out to bid three wide
between foes entering upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap while prevailing for the place honors. PERFETTO tracked the leaders in the
four path racing three deep in second flight racing to the turn, was prompted to advance while being fanned five wide into upper stretch but continued with
interest to edge rivals for a share. QUICK ENTRY, in touch with the first flight between foes, was eased outside the leaders racing into the turn while being
urged to bid three deep, then four wide between foes nearing the lane but weakened between rivals late. HEY BIG GUY, off slowly, was settled last while
switching out early, angled in entering the turn to split foes just off the inside entering upper stretch but flattened out in late stages. NATIVE HAWK tracked
off the first flight between foes racing to the turn but faded early. MAGICAL TALE, brushed at the start, was rated off the second flight while angling inside
but offered no rally. CALL ME HANDSOME joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards racing into the turn pressing the pace outside
the eventual winner but gave way between foes midstretch.

Footnotes
THE CURT FOX (GB), reserved in early stages, was prompted to advance three wide racing into the far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and
continued with a sustained response to wrest a clear advantage in time under firm handling. SILENT JET was rated inside rivals as part of the second flight
racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while switching out four wide in upper stretch, gained a brief advantage leaving the furlong marker but
couldn't contain the winner, then was vanned off the course when failing to return to be unsaddled, subsequently voiding a claim. HOT AND HEAVY angled
inwards racing through the chute crossing the path of MINNESOTA LUCKY to gain a forward placing between foes prompting the pace into the backstretch,
tracked the pacesetter outside a rival to the second bend, shifted three deep nearing upper stretch to bid for command between foes, contested the issue
past midstretch but weakened late while just lasting for a share. JUST THE FACTS, gained a position just off the first flight along the inside, was eased back
to be reserved off the second flight racing through the backstretch, switched out nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position
between foes. NOTORIOUS NICK ducked out at the start forcing out DERBY CHAMPAGNE, was righted, then urged to the lead along the inside racing to
the first turn, conceded the lead entering the backstretch to track the pacesetter along the inside, was prompted to bid for command along the rail nearing
upper stretch but had no final kick. TOUPHA was rated between foes in second flight to the backstretch but came up empty nearing the lane. MINNESOTA
LUCKY, caught in tight quarters leaving the chute, switched outside foes on the first turn while prompted to gain the advantage, set the pace along the
inside on a clear margin racing to the far turn and gave out between foes entering upper stretch. NEW JERSEY JOHN settled inside foes racing to the
backstretch and failed to menace. MAYRHOFEN, cut off at the start, proved no threat. DERBY CHAMPAGNE, forced out at the start crossing over the path
of MAYRHOFEN, was righted to track the leaders four wide, then three wide in second flight to the backstretch but faded early.
