GENESIS G G raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear. BECOMING SMITTY was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished well to gain the place. ASK ME
HOW IKNOW tracked the pace from the inside, moved up in tandem with the winner to offer a bid in mid-stretch but failed to sustain his rally. MIDNIGHT
HORIZON was off a step slow then allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with some late run.
STERLING GLADIATOR was off slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. WINDSOR'S FUN broke sharply to chase the
leader while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. MARLEESBEEBEE broke through the gate prior to the start, sprinted clear at once, saved
ground while setting the pace and weakened after a half. PER RULING #19 FROM THE WEST VIRIGINA RACING COMMISSION, GENESIS G G WAS

PROTA sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch, responded when set down for the
drive and held sway to the wire. MARTIN MAN was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out late and finished with good late courage.
ABSALOM broke sharply then checked nearing the seven-eighths pole, chased the winner while racing three-wide throughout and failed to gain on that foe
in the drive. SIENTE EL VIENTO settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. SING A VERSE
lagged early, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace. BRIBERY was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn
and gradually weakened. Due to a timer malfunction some of the internal fractions were unavailable.

Footnotes
KEVINS CHIOCE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive, wore down
SHORTLISTER inside the sixteenth pole and was going away late. SHORTLISTER sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, remained
in control through mid-stretch but could no match strides with the winner late. TAURIAN showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn,
angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. BROTHER SKYE broke sharply to chase the pace of SHORTLISTER while racing
three-wide and gave way in the drive. CECIL THE LION settled off the leaders throughout and failed to rally. FIFTH OF NOVEMBER was void of early
speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace. FAVOR MAKER raced four-wide through the first turn, showed brief speed and
weakened.

furlong to run and held sway to the wire. MY FRIENDS BEER was bumped at the start, raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second
turn and was up for the place. DONTMESAWITHME set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way to the winner after going five furlongs. TRIFOR

Footnotes
YOU MADE IT was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew clear.
KATIE'S BAYOU sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, remained in control with a furlong to run and yielded to the winner through
the final sixteenth. PARCHED GHOST settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out with a furlong to run and finished
evenly late. ESTHER'S FORTUNE was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, remained inside and finished with
some late run. PUT POSITION broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing four-wide and gradually gave way. EARNED THE SHOT was void of early
speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. BOOM BOOM GONE raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the
second turn and failed to rally. MY MISS MARILYN chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. DAH PHILLY
raced four-wide through both turns, lacked early foot and did not offer a bid. ADIOS HILLARY showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second
turn and was not a factor.
