Footnotes
REPORT TO DUTY saved ground just off the leaders, rallied inside through the final sixteenth and was along in time. J TRAIN was on the pace inside rivals,
came to the three path into the lane then could not contain the winner's late run while saving the place late. MR. BIG SHOT moved up outside J TRAIN to
challenge into the far turn, continued evenly and could not produce the needed late run. LEON'S DIAMOND stalked the pace four wide to have aim through
the far turn but lacked a final closing run. RAGTOP RED raced well off the rail while trailing. EL PRIETO chased the early pace, gave way in the far turn and
pulled up in the lane but walked off under his own power.

chased the winner three wide and closed some in the lane. EVERYDAYISAGOODDAY was along the inside and could not go with the top pair. KNOCK ON
IT had no rally four wide. CHAN MAN also had no rally four wide. HEY WHERES LOGAN was not a factor. KID WINMOR was sluggish into stride and
trailed.

TROUBLEWITHACURVE made the pace on a short lead about the two path, shook free through the far turn then was kept to urging in the lane while well
clear. DOUBLE ONE SHOT stalked the pace three or four wide, rallied clear for the place in the lane but could not get to the winner. MIDNIGHT LEWIS was
close up along the inside to the far turn and weakened in the lane to lose position. ROLLIN RIVER saved ground and moved up through the lane to narrowly
miss third. KIDO'S SLING SHOT pressed the winner outside for a half and weakened. BIG BLUE OKIE was not a factor four wide. PAIN FOR GAIN failed to
offer a bid racing about the three path. SLIM CHANCE was always back.

Footnotes
ANWARA was last away and settled at the back of the field through the opening half, began her rally while angling out in the far turn, came six wide into the
lane and closed late to be up in the closing yards. HOBBS HOPE stalked the lead group three and four wide, rallied through the lane but missed late.
MEMORIES GALORE stalked the leaders three and four wide to bid and gain the lead into the lane but could not contain the top pair late. BRENDA'S
FEVER was back off the pace outside, moved five wide in the far turn but lacked the needed late bid. EYE ON HARPER saved ground and lacked a rally.
DIXIE DELTA contested the pace between rivals and weakened. GOLD ZEPHYR prompted the pace three and four wide to the far turn and weakened into
the lane. HANNAH BO BABY showed the most speed to gain inside position and contest the pace to the far turn then tired in that bend.

ROCKET late and was in time. SYLVIA'S ROCKET was on the pace outside rivals to move clear midway up the backstretch, resisted then traded contact
with the winner deep stretch and missed. The rider of Sylvia's Rocket lodged a claim of foul against the winner alleging interference in deep stretch which
was not allowed. P R GIRL CRUSH followed the pace two and three wide, gained position in the lane but could not get to the top pair. JOY FOREVER
moved up three and four wide but could not threaten late. TREPI'S TRPL CROWN saved ground and was not a serious threat. JUST SPLENDID was with
the early pace four wide, fanned six wide into the lane and weakened. STRIKE PERFECTION was always back. ALWAYS A TIZ showed some early foot to
contest the lead and tired.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN MOJO was off the early leaders three wide, rallied through the far turn then responded with a late rally to run down MY PERFECT GRAYDAR
in the closing yards. MY PERFECT GRAYDAR dueled outside a pair of rivals early, continued into the lane then could not contain the winner late.
CONTRABAND dueled inside to upper stretch and weakened late. BIG MACINTOSH saved ground and lacked the needed closing bid late while finishing
on even terms with I'M LUCKY. I'M LUCKY was four wide in the turn, fanned six wide into the lane and made a mild late run. GO FOR JIM failed to mount a
rally three wide. SKY GLORY lacked a bid racing four and five wide. MR. WHITE showed brief speed between rivals and weakened.

Footnotes
KING OF ANYTHING stalked the leaders three and four wide, bid between rivals nearing the lane and slowly edged clear late. LIGHT BOUND BID stalked
the pace four wide, bid going to the far turn then could not handle the winner late. DOMINANTE settled off the pace three wide, rallied four wide in the far
turn and gained third. I CALL SHOTGUN was in reach three or four wide but lacked a solid closing bid. STICKINWITHTHEGUYS was last away, rallied
outside to fan seven wide into the lane and could not threaten late. CALLME MR MISTER was two or three wide and failed to seriously threaten. KEEP ON
ZENON ON settled in reach three wide, fanned six wide into the lane and had no rally. BRETT'S BOY tracked the leaders racing out from the rail and
weakened. CHERUBIM showed the most early speed to gain position out from the rail, made the pace to late backstretch and tired. RAIN RAY was always
back.
