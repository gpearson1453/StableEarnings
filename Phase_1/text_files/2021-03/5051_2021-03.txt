MITHRA allowed to settle inside, made a quick wide bid on the final turn, collared the leader and edged clear while confidently handled. INSTAFAMOUS set
a clear pace, drifted out in the stretch and continued gamely to the finish. AND SEEK saved ground throughout, was asked for run on the final turn but
flattened out. LIAR SIDE CHAT pursued the loose pacesetter outside and was finished after three quarters. PETER G. FOX dropped back early and lost
contact with his field.

BORDERLINE GENIUS broke a step slowly, advanced inside to the stretch, angled out and surged clear in the late stages. MIRACULOUSBLESSING
forced the pace outside, took over near the quarter pole, rallied clear but was outfinished. OUR DIXIE BLUE hustled to the front inside, was collared on the
turn and weakened. UNION RALLY chased off the pace in the two path, moved wide in the stretch and lacked a bid. ORIGINALY FROM DOT urged close
up inside, steadied into the far turn and had no further response. LUCKY IMAGINATION raced three wide just off the leaders and gave way readily.

GLORY SONG pressed the pace from the outside, then stalked, chased on the far turn, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied outside of FIRST CITIZEN
and dug in gamely to prevail. FIRST CITIZEN set the pace racing with a short lead, showed the way into the far turn, responded when roused, dug in
gamely in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly. KINGSVILLE stalked outside, chased the leaders on the far turn and finished evenly. IRISH MEADOW
raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane and had no rally. NAUGHTY PRINCE steadied slightly after the start, raced two wide off the pace,
chased on the far turn and failed to threaten. SOCIETY'S TIGER was off a bit slow, raced three wide off the pace, moved up on the far turn, then faded.
TEAM EFFORT pulled a bit early, then tracked close up inside, chased and gave way.

SENSE A MILLION outrun early inside, advanced wide on the turn then closed strongly through the stretch outfinishing pair of inside rivals. SHATTER ME
urged in the two path down the backstretch, rallied with the winner late and was second best. THIS ROUND'S MINE dueled briefly inside, widened on the
turn and in the stretch but weakened late. LIKE A PRO lagged far behind racing wide and showed some late energy. CHARLY'S CHARM dropped back
wide and continued well while no threat. NEW JERSEY saved ground behind the pacesetters and lacked a rally. ELIZABETH T lagged far behind and was
never in contention. ARTEMIS RISING forced the pace briefly, began stopping on the turn and was eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
INDIAN LAKE set the pace racing with a clear lead throughout, moved away on the far turn, responded when roused and was kept to the task in the final
furlong. NINE TOE JOHNNY was off a bit slow, raced off the pace, advanced on the far turn, rallied inside entering the stretch, angled out and came up
second best. LOUIE'S LAW tracked inside, chased inside on the far turn, between rivals into the stretch, lacked a winning bid and earned the show spot.
DOLLARIZATION raced three wide early, then stalked between rivals, chased two wide on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. SMOKUM PEACE
PIPE raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. BLUEBERRY MASH raced four wide early, stalked three wide and faded. NOBODY KNEW raced off
the rail, off the pace and did not factor.

GETOFFMYBACK stalked the dueling leaders, angled out nearing the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane, rallied steadily outside, gained command
and edged away late, driving. THE ITALIAN dueled between rivals for the lead, dueled on the turn, dug in gamely in the stretch drive, battled on and earned
the place spot. INKY DINKY DO dueled inside for the lead, chased on the turn, re bid on the rail entering the stretch and dug in gamely inside to the finish.
