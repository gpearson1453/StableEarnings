Footnotes
UNION PARK GAL (IRE) tracked the dueling leaders three wide around the turn, wrested command outside MISS LAMARR past the eighth-pole and was all
out to prove best. MISS LAMARR dueled inside LA DAME for three furlongs, got the best of that dispute in upper stretch, swapped back to her left lead
battling back inside the winner a sixteenth out, and fought gamely to the finish. BAHAMIAN RHAPSODY stayed in range two to three wide to the stretch,
and finished evenly. HASHTAG LUCKY raced two wide, and lacked a closing response. ECLIPTICALS CAROL saved ground and failed to factor. FIOR DI
LATTE raced three to four wide, and had no rally. LA DAME dueled outside MISS LAMARR for three-eighths of a mile, and tired. CATIRUSIA broke slowly,
and was always outrun. PISCES was never prominent. BOCA GIRL bumped with GREATA at the start, and raced far back. LA GUERRERITA was outrun
throughout. GREATA bumped with BOCA GIRL at the start, bore out to the outside fence entering the turn and lost contact with the others, then was
carefully handled through the lane.

Footnotes
INFATUATING set the pace along the rail, eased into the two path nearing the quarter pole, drew off under a drive and held well clear under mild urging in
the final furlong. SHAKEM settled off the pace outside, raced four wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and was clearly second best.
KENTUCKY PRIDE raced off the pace two wide and was along for the show. KIRBY was in range inside, angled three wide near the three-eighths marker
and faded. GREENWOOD DRIVE pressed the winner two wide and retreated nearing the quarter pole. FEARLESS IDEAS stalked the pace three wide,
angled in near the five-sixteenths pole, swung widest in upper stretch and had no response.

Footnotes
OCEAN AIR settled off the early leaders three wide, moved in a path edging a bit closer after six furlongs, rallied through between horses in deep stretch
and was up outside HONOR HOP near the line. HONOR HOP was in tight quarters, steadied and bumped with TALK RADIO entering the first turn, saved
ground in the second flight to the stretch, rallied gamely along the rail and was nipped in the final strides. SO ELUSIVE set the pace near the inside, shook
off STARRY HOPE while drifting to the three-path coming off the far turn, and stayed clear into the final furlong before being overhauled from inside by the
top two finishers. RUNAWAY MOM bumped with A LOOKER a few strides from the gate, came four wide into the stretch and found her best stride too late.
TALK RADIO bumped with HONOR HOP and checked sharply entering the first turn, and never got out of the second flight. A LOOKER bumped with
RUNAWAY MOM after the start, stayed in range three wide to the far turn, was unhurried a quarter-mile out with the rider looking around on both sides,
remained on hold to the eighth-pole and was empty when roused. STARRY HOPE pressed SO ELUSIVE from outside, got shaken off into the lane and
gave way. KISS THEORY was hustled along attempting to make room for herself along the rail approaching the first turn, checked and took up sharply
inside HONOR HOP and lost her action, and ran along far behind. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY FOCUSING ON THE RUN TO THE FIRST TURN
BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
BEARS WATCHING brushed with GOLDEN SPOKE at the start, was up with the front flight but let them go on with it after a quarter-mile, saved ground
content to follow along from close range into the turn, moved out four wide near the five-sixteenths as the rider let out a notch, swept past and opened up
hand urged once straightened away, and was wrapped up through the late stages. GRAN RUNNER moved off the inside midway up the backstretch, came
five wide rallying off the turn and finished willingly to best the others. RABDAN moved out three wide approaching the quarter-pole, and was up for the
show. MYSTERY MO broke awkwardly, lost some ground entering the turn two wide, shifted to the four-path into the lane and was outfinished for third.
STAINLESS STEEL bumped twice with KODADEPENDENT at the start, pressed the pace three wide to the top of the stretch, and weakened. SENSIBLE
JIM became fractious in the gate dislodging the rider prior to the start, broke inward and was never close. SUMMER SERMON broke outward, vied inside
rivals for a half-mile, and faded steadily through the lane. ZALINSKY walked out of the gate two lengths behind the next-to-last horse, and was outrun
inside. KODAPENDENT took the worst of two bumps with STAINLESS STEEL at the break, and was outrun three wide. MAYBE AFTER LATER vied up
front between horses early, and was finished before reaching the stretch. GOLDEN SPOKE brushed with BEARS WATCHING at the start, raced three to
four wide, and was through leaving the turn.

BOURBON IN MAY settled off the pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, seized command in upper stretch and drew clear under a drive.
RIJEKA (IRE) trailed inside through the opening mile, went three wide around the far turn and finished well to gain the place. THEREGOESJOJO contested
the pace two wide under a snug hold around the first two turns, cleared the pace rival and angled in approaching the far turn, set the pace inside from there
to upper stretch and stayed on to hold third. SOGLIO fought rating two wide between foes and lacked a rally. SMALL HOPE set the early pace inside and
weakened around the far turn. MORNING STRIDE saved ground in midpack early, went four wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. YAMATO
stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the lane and came up empty. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
FLY LIKE AN EAGLE settled in striking range three wide for six furlongs, rallied to overhaul EL SOCIO in deep stretch and drove clear. NEOTROPIC saved
ground in the middle of the pack to the far turn, moved to the two-path for the drive and rallied between horses. EL SOCIO took a stutter-step hop while
breaking alertly, set a moderate pace inside to the stretch, and weakened leaving the eighth-pole. PLEASE THE PHAROAH was never far back, raced three
then four wide around the far turn, and rallied mildly outside. SAILOR'S RETURN was three to four wide around the far turn, and made no appreciable
headway late. GWAUN RIVER VALLEY tugged along under a firm hold behind the early leaders, remained inside to the far turn, and could not quicken on
the rail through the lane. LUPINO (GB) pressed the pace outside EL SOCIO to upper stretch, and tired. HARDISON was forced out at the start and slow to
begin, and remained outrun. BIGGIE broke outward, and was never close. ADARA was outrun three to four wide. CHANNELING was always far back.
FIRST TASK was forced out at the start, lost contact with the field soon after that, got pulled up entering the backstretch, and walked off.

Footnotes
CAROTARI took the lead with an alert getaway, edged away in upper stretch and was driving to remain clear. CITRUS BURST raced close up around the
turn three then four wide, and finished willingly outside THE CONNECTOR to get the place. THE CONNECTOR pressed the pace two wide from the start,
could not gain through the lane and was edged for second while clear of the rest. MAI TY ONE ON raced between horses around the turn two wide, and
was one-paced through the drive. HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE saved ground throughout, and lacked the needed closing response. YES I AM FREE was a
step slow to begin, moved off the inside to wind up four wide late on the turn, and could not gain. KOBE FIFTY TWO pressed the pace three wide, and gave
way into the stretch. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR was no menace two to three wide.

Footnotes
DANZING DUNHILL settled in midpack while saving ground, split rivals nearing the eighth pole, closed inside, took over near the sixteenth marker and
edged ahead under a steady drive. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT raced off the pace two wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and finished strongly outside to get
up for second on the wire. NINJA DUST tracked the pace from the rail, angled three wide in upper stretch, bid between foes and was narrowly outfinished.
JUAN PABLO was pinched back at the start, raced well back two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, shifted widest in upper stretch and rallied.
GUACO raced three wide in midpack early, advanced three wide around the far turn, battled on between but was outkicked in the lane. BEACH TRAFFIC
was bumped and forced to check at the start, saved ground well back, made good progress just inside of the winner in upper stretch, was blocked near the
eighth pole and never got clear sailing. HERO UP set the pace along the rail and tired late. WISE TO LISTEN pressed the pace two wide, continued on the
left lead in the lane and faded. MEMORABLE veered in at the start and bumped BEACH TRAFFIC, raced three and four wide and lacked a rally. BEINFUN
chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid.
