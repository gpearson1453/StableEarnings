Footnotes
MERMAID KISSES broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin near the inside racing to the turn, shook clear nearing upper stretch and held sway
to the end under pressure. LIGHTS DOWN LOW, off slowly, tracked the pacesetter along the inside, continued with a steady effort into the stretch and
proved best of the others. U KNOW I B LION tracked the pacesetter three wide while rated just outside that rival, was fanned four wide into the stretch and
had no closing bid while continuing well enough to edge a rival for a share. PASZ THE PEPPER, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the
pacesetter to the turn, steadily faded nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
SOSUA broke readily, dictated the pace between rivals on a narrow advantage on her own courage racing to the turn, forged clear nearing upper stretch,
widened the advantage under pressure and was gathered up nearing the wire. MASTERING BELA broke out bumping JOYOUS FAIRY TALE, was settled
last racing to the turn, angled four wide in upper stretch and displayed some late interest to gain the place honors late. JOYOUS FAIRY TALE, bumped at
the start, tracked off the second flight a bit off the inside, made brief progress to gain second while swerving about under pressure entering upper stretch
and came up empty. HEY HOTTIE, urged prompting the pacesetter in the three path racing to the turn, gave way into upper stretch. MA COCO tracked off
the second flight along the inside, switched out nearing upper stretch but lacked a rally. SENA THE DUCHESS angled inside early and soon faded.

Footnotes
MAGO ON MY MIND, off slowly, was settled between foes, shifted out on the far turn while being prompted to advance, produced a steady rally racing five
wide into upper stretch and went clear late under firm encouragement. CLAP FOR ME tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight to the
backstretch, conceded position to the pacesetter racing to the far turn, continued with a steady advance to wrest the advantage in upper stretch but couldn't
fend off the winner's bid. VOW SAVER, bumped by FIRST GOLD, bobbled at the start, was reserved in the last flight, angled to the inside nearing the far
turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. STARSHIP HARLEM exchanged bumps with LADY CHITU at the
break, ducked inwards crossing the path of WHAT A KNOCKOUT in the opening stages, tracked just off the second flight along the inside to the
backstretch, shifted out racing into the far turn to lodge a brief, three wide bid in upper stretch but had no final kick. R TENDERONI, caught in tight nearest
the rail just after the start, settled while switching off the inside and continued evenly three deep between foes to late stages. FIRST GOLD broke inwards
bumping VOW SAVER lightly, was righted while angling to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight to the backstretch, advanced along
the inside to close the gap on the nearing upper stretch but had no closing bid. WHAT A KNOCKOUT, cut off, then steadied just after the start, was
reserved near the inside to the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn, was fanned four wide into the lane and had no late response. INERTIA swerved out
at the start, was righted to set the pace along the inside, was sent well clear racing through the backstretch into the far turn and gave out entering upper
stretch. LADY CHITU exchanged bumps with STARSHIP HARLEM at the start, was righted to track off the second flight between rivals and faded into the
lane. SOCIAL DISCUSSION, caught wide from the chute to the backstretch, dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED
AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE START AND DISQUALIFIED STARSHIP HARLEM FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER SEVENTH.

Footnotes
ORNERY ANGEL broke readily, tracked just off the first flight outside foes on the backstretch, continued with a steady advance in tandem with a rival to
race four wide through the turn, gained the advantage while shifting inwards leaving midstretch and held the late challenge of MI CLEOPATRA AND I to the
end under strong handling. The latter exchanged bumps at the start with ARNOLD'S PATSY, was settled off the leaders while switching out racing to the
turn, circled foes five wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap. CLARIST was hustled up inside foes to set the pace on a
narrow margin just off the rail racing to the turn, dueled inside foes past midstretch but yielded late. PURPLE SCOOTER tracked just off the leaders nearest
the inside and continued evenly late. PLAY THE MAX tracked just off the first flight four wide in early stages, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner
three deep between foes nearing upper stretch, then shifted out in the closing stages while flattening out. FLAMING INDY, urged three wide between foes
prompting the pace in the opening stages, dueled between foes into the lane and gave way. THE OTHER CAT tracked off the first flight between foes racing
to the turn but dropped back early. ARNOLD'S PATSY exchanged bumps at the start, was settled last and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DAZZLING TRUTHS, reserved along the inside just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, shifted out four wide
nearing midstretch and produced a steady late response to just prevail in time under firm handling. THRESHOLD settled along the inside in the opening
half, shifted out gathering momentum entering the far turn, split foes three wide racing into upper stretch, bid for command in tandem with several rivals
leaving the sixteenth marker and just rivals for second on the wire while failing to match the winner. FLY THE W tracked the pacesetter outside a rival, then
between foes as part of the second flight racing to the far turn, steadily gained terms with the pacesetter to bid for command between rivals leaving
midstretch but was outkicked by the winner while just missing for second. SKIPPY'S STRIKE sped clear of the field while angling to the inside, dictated the
pace on a clear margin along the rail to upper stretch, resisted when challenged leaving the furlong marker but was collared late. LORD BARNA tracked the
pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight, was urged to advance in tight quarters between foes just off the inside racing through the stretch but
lacked the needed final kick. JUNGLE FIGHTER tracked off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to make some brief progress three
wide racing into the far turn but proved empty in the drive. THE BOSS FACTOR broke in the air while ducking outwards hitting the gate to nearly dislodge
his rider, was settled last while collecting his stride and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SHARON'S LAW broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the rail to the backstretch, resisted when challenged by WILL TAKE ROSES
leaving the midway point of the far turn, dueled inside that foe past midstretch, drifted out under left handed pressure in the closing stages bumping that rival
but edged forward in time to prevail. WILL TAKE ROSES, forwardly placed between rivals attending the pace in the opening half, pressed the issue on the
far turn to gain a narrow advantage, continued in a protracted skirmish past midstretch, then was bumped, then carried out in the closing stages while failing
to match terms with her rival. DREAMINOFDASIES tracked off the first flight between foes, then along the inside racing into the lane, altered course four
wide in the closing stages but prevailed for a share. HONESTA settled near the inside dropping well off the second flight to the backstretch, angled out five
wide racing through the lane and gained some position while making no real impression. KAUFY FUTURES tracked the leaders outside rivals in second
flight in the opening stages, advanced after a half to lodge a brief, three wide bid racing into the far turn but flattened out in upper stretch.
CAPTUREMENOW tracked off the first flight inside rivals, saved ground on the far turn and faded in the drive. VANA GRAND, off slowly, then caught wide
early while being prompted to contend, failed to menace. MY BLONDE MARY broke outwards bumping at the start, was held up out of tight quarters
conceding some position, shifted out three wide racing to the backstretch to race as part of the second flight but emptied out early. FOLLOWING THE
RACE, THE RIDER OF WILL TAKES ROSES LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SHARON'S LAW ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN
LATE STRETCH WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED SHARON'S LAW FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER SECOND.

Footnotes
T J MUNNINGS gained a forward placing along the rail racing to the first turn while pulling hard against restraint once headed entering that bend, was rated
inside foes conceding some position under patient handling to the second bend, saved ground to upper stretch, then shifted three deep advancing on the
leaders nearing the furlong marker and took charge under firm handling. POSEIDONS MYTH switched outside foes racing to the backstretch to gain terms
with the pacesetter three wide between foes after a half, shifted in on the far turn to press the issue outside a rival into upper stretch, dueled for command to
midstretch but couldn't contain the winner while prevailing for the place honors. CHARGE INTO WAR was rated off the second flight along the inside to the
backstretch, switched out after a half, was prompted to advance four wide on the far turn, was fanned six wide into the lane but continued with interest to
edge rivals for a share. NOTHIN REALLY ducked out at the start cutting off OLD MAN MAC, was prompted to a contending position while caught four wide
racing to the backstretch, continued just outside the leaders while fanned five wide into the lane and was outkicked for a share. TOLL GATE was hustled to
the lead outside foes racing to the first turn, angled to the rail once gaining the advantage, dueled for command inside foes through the far turn into upper
stretch but gave way leaving the furlong marker. NOT INVENTED HERE was rated just off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch but couldn't
produce a closing bid. UNCLE CHARMING angled inwards while being urged to contention between foes prompting the pace after the opening, couldn't
match the leaders after six furlongs and gave way into the lane. MAGIC BOMB tracked off the second flight unhurried between foes in early stages, was
shuffled back avoiding close quarters nearing the backstretch and offered no rally. OLD MAN MAC, cut off at the start, was settled off the inside early and
failed to menace. COMMANDER KEITH hopped at the start, then was steadied out of tight quarters early and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PAPAJUDGY broke sharply to gain a clear advantage between calls, angled inwards racing through the backstretch to dictate the pace on a narrow
advantage just off the inside, dueled for command between foes through the turn to upper stretch, then shook clear late under firm left handed pressure to
prove best. ARRIVEDERLA tracked off the first flight between foes, was prompted to advance three wide entering the turn to challenge in that path nearing
upper stretch but couldn't match terms with the winner while besting the others. HARD WEST angled to the inside in early to track just off the first flight
racing into the turn, advanced along the rail when presented an opening in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. LEGACY AZTECA tracked off the
second flight outside foes on the backstretch, advanced four wide racing into the turn to gain a contending position nearing the lane but flattened out late.
STRIKING HEIR, urged along the inside prompting the pacesetter into the turn, dueled inside that foe to upper stretch and gave way late. VALLEY
WILDCAT, held up avoiding close quarters in early stages, settled off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn and failed to produce a closing
response. LI'L MEATBALL was a brief factor three wide between foes in second flight but faded early.

PRINCESS NINA tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted inwards nearing the far turn to advance on
the leader between foes, bid for command nearing upper stretch, quickly wrested the advantage and went clear under firm handling. KITTEN WITH A WHIP
tracked off the second flight outside foes under light rating in the opening half, was prompted to advance three wide entering the far turn, couldn't match the
winner in the drive but proved best of the others. MUSETTA worked her way to the inside settling out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance while switching out four wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share. DONYA'S MAGIC broke outwards at
the start, was urged clear along the rail to the backstretch, set the pace on a clear margin to the far turn but gave out once headed by the winner.
DIXIELAND DARLING, brushed at the start, angled to the inside to track off the second flight but offered no rally. TIZ HERSELF settled last along the inside
early and passed inside tiring rivals. BABY BEE MERRY, brushed at the start, was righted to track just off the pacesetter along the inside as part of the
second flight racing to the backstretch but came up empty nearing the lane. CHARLITA, forwardly placed between foes in second flight, faded after a half.
DOUBLE DOT settled outside foes off the second flight, angled out five wide in upper stretch but had no rally. HOPE LADY, squeezed at the start, then held
up just after the break, was settled between foes, then fanned six wide into the stretch while proving no threat.
