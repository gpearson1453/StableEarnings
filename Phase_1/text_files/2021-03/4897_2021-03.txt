CARRIE'S SUCCESS tracked the early pace, went six wide into the turn, was gaining through the turn, took control at the eighth pole and edged clear for
the win. RED NOON RISING was up close early, went five wide into the turn, took a brief lead into the stretch, couldn't hold off the winner and finished
second best. JUST CLASSY was void of any early speed, angled to the inside out of the turn and offered a mild late rally. CASA BONITA was outrun early,
raced off the rail into the turn, angled out through the turn and flattened out. DELIGHTFUL HIPS pressed the early pace, went three wide into the turn,
drifted out and weakened. HIT IT TWICE was unhurried early, circled eight wide and offered no late rally. SHESAHEATWAVE pressed the early pace, went
four wide into the turn, checked and faded. THE STEWARDS CALLED FOR AN INQUIRY FOR AN INCIDENT THROUGH THE TURN AND TOOK NO
ACTION.

Footnotes
MR. MAGICO was reserved early, raced along the inside, angled out four wide in early stretch, was closing late and was up in time for the win. LIFELINE
was unhurried early, went four wide into the second turn, angled out, gaining, just missed. FAMOUS ROCK STAR set a clear pace, raced off the rail, drifted
out, weakened late stretch and finished a game third. DAWOOD was void of speed, advanced six wide through the second turn, was closing late and
needed more ground. THORN HILL CAT was void of speed, saved ground and finished belatedly. REY COLIMAN was taken back early from the inside and
offered a mild late rally. ITS A BOY raced in mid pack early, went five wide into the second turn and was evenly late. RED CLEM followed the early pace
and faded. REAL LUTE was outrun early and was no factor. MI MALDITO AMOR was allowed to settle early and was finished early.
