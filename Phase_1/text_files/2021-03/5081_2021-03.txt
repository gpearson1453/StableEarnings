Footnotes
THAT'STHEWAYTODOIT well placed inside to the turn, angled out five wide into the stretch with a good rush and ran past to clear in the final sixteenth.
ANSWER MY CALL had an awkward start, no speed to the turn, rallied outside through the stretch run for place spot. APPEALING JULIA never far back to
the turn, rallied three wide while outpaced for second spot. JILLS PASSION dueled from two path to the turn and weakened in the stretch run. SWEET
CARLI tracked three wide to the turn but gave way readily from that point. LOVE THE POWER (FR) inside speed to the quarter pole and gave way in the
stretch run. THERE WAS NO FIVE EIGHTHS TIME DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.

GRAND HIDEAWAY chased outside, roused wide into stretch, along in time. ANYTIMEALLTHETIME close up throughout, stayed on in the stretch,
outfinished. MY PAL DAL outside to turn, angled in stretch, rallied up rail for show spot. MACHO MADNESS inside run to turn, got through to lead,
outkicked to wire. ROYAL LEIGE quick speed to chase to turn, led into stretch, faltered late. LAS ANA never close to turn, improved position only in the
drive. RESPECT THE BOSS never menaced. I PROWL ALONE rushed inside, to the front, gave way from the turn. WICKED WEDNESDAY tardy start,
never a factor. ZOODLES never far back to turn, steadied quarter pole, gave way readily. SNORING BARTH off slow, always trailed.

Footnotes
SEQUIN sharp speed to the front, well handled to stay well clear in the final furlong. MISS MOSAIC chased all out to the turn, could not go on, proving no
match for winner late. STRONG ODOR swerved in start bothering rival, never far back to stretch but leveled off late. BROOKE MARIE chased winner to turn
but gave way in the stretch run. PRINCESSTAPITURE raced evenly while lacking the late response needed. CLEAR AS DAY never close. SHELLEY'S
GEM was slammed hard at the start and never recovered.

aim, missed. CHRISTIANS CITY inside run to far turn, angled out with run, outpaced to wire. CACAHUETE chased pace to the half, leveled off from far turn.
EASY DOER sharp break, pace to deep stretch, weakened in the drive. LIZZY'S LURE widest first turn, improved position only from the half. CATCH A CAB
never factored. STEWARDS RULES raced evenly along to far turn, nothing left, came up empty. DETERMINATOR through after half, dropped back readily.
HONDO GUSTO dropped back quickly from inside. ALPHA BOY never close far back, vanned off following the finish.
