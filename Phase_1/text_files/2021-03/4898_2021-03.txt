Footnotes
SMOOTH COLLIERY stalked the leaders in the early going, waited around the turn, blocked, split rivals entering the stretch, rallied and was going away at
the end. BIG EM C vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. RED WHITE AND LOUD
raced near the back in the early part, came around the turn wide, rallied and got up for third. DREWZANO challenged for the early lead, weakened and was
no threat late. LENAPE DRIVE dueled on the front end and faded. MASTERLY went to the front and was finished early. STORMATION always raced near
the back and was outrun.

SLICK IT UP raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the stretch and prevailed. FLASHLIGHTSECURITY void of early speed,
moved up around the final turn, racing wide, rallied down the lane and finished willingly. CLEVER PRINCE lacked early speed, came around the second turn
wide, made a late bid and was outfinished by the top two. DIT sprinted to the front, drove clear, was outfinished late, lacking a kick. FIRSTTIMEVALENTINE
raced within striking distance, lacked a rally and finished evenly. REMEMBER ME POP pressed the pace, saved ground around the final turn and
weakened. GRIP TIGHT raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. AMANDAS LIGHTENING raced in the middle of the field, came around the first
wide, faded and was no threat late. DALE'S LIL BRO showed early speed and dropped back. TOO TUFF TO CRY void of early speed and showed little.

CHU CHU'S LEGACY went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and won under steady urging. CARBON STRYKER vied for the early lead, forwardly
placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. ADIOS CARLOS challenged for the early lead, saved ground, raced close
throughout, but proved third best at the wire. LAST APPEAL raced within contention, came around the turn on the outside and finished evenly. G'WILDCAT
raced near the back in the beginning, improved position, but was no factor. TAPPED TO THE MAX raced within striking distance, near the middle of the field
and weakened. SIXTO void of early speed, lacked a bid and was outrun. ON TILT always raced near the back and showed little.

WISH FOR INTEREST challenged for the early advantage, raced outside around the turn, made a late bid, four wide and proved the best. ROSE CROWN
unhurried in the beginning, saved ground around the turn, gained ground and was a clear second. RAISING THE ROOF dueled for the early lead, raced
close throughout and weakened. CAJUN MUSIC raced in the back of the pack, closed willingly and missed the show position. MALLORY'S HOME showed
early speed, saved ground around the turn and faded. ARANCIA stumbled start, raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. MANE PRIORITY
raced within contention and dropped to the rear.

close throughout and was a clear second at the wire. VIVINSKY raced in the back in the beginning, came around the first turn on the outside, saved ground
around the final turn, made a late rail bid, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. ZENS SECRET raced within striking distance, came around
the final turn four wide, made a mild bid and finished evenly. READY REDDING unruly in the gates, bumped start, racing in the rear, showed late interest,
but was no threat. LAURIANO bumped at the start, vied for the lead and weakened down the final stretch. WATERWILD broke out, raced near the back and
was never a threat. WICKED CITI lacked early speed and showed little. BLAZIN' ASIAN dueled for the early lead, raced inside around the second turn and
faded.
