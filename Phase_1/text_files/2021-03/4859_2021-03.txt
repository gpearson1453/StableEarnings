Footnotes
TROUBLE N PARADISE sat off of early moderate pace, travelling in the two path on the turn, was asked for run at the head of the stretch, rallied and
gamely dueled HEAT SEEKING LETA in the closing stages. HEAT SEEKING LETA was unhurried early, saved ground along the turn, swung three wide at
the top of the stretch, dueled TROUBLE N PARADISE to the wire and just missed. ROYAL ALEXIS was hustled early to the lead, setting moderate fractions
while navigating a rail trip, was headed in the stretch and tired in the drive. RED DAHLIA settled midpack early, lost position on the turn while travelling four
wide, and made a belated late run. BRITE TAN settled toward the rear of the field in the early stages, was outrun into the turn, saved ground coming into the
stretch and had no late response.

Footnotes
ROUEN was well placed to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, edged clear to mid stretch and held driving. AL MILLON BOB set the pace in
the two path, was collared in upper stretch but stubbornly saved second. COUNTING CARDS was rank into the first turn between rivals, settled on the
backstretch, raced three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and could not make an impact late. ASSET was unhurried for a half mile, got
fanned four wide on the second turn and did not rally in the drive. SAL MAGLIE broke a step slow, had no speed, came off the rail at the quarter pole then
lugged inward under right handed urging in mid stretch and finished evenly. PARADISE FOREVER tracked the pace to the second turn, saved ground but
was tiring in upper stretch then had to steady when crowded by SAL MAGLIE in mid stretch and gave way.

mid stretch and held driving. LUCKY MS JONES trailed to the second turn, circled rivals four wide to the stretch and finished steadily for second. INDIAN
DANCER set the pace while off the rail on both turns, stayed to mid stretch but was weakening late. BORN TO REIGN was settled for a half mile, came two
wide to the stretch but lacked a response in the drive. MARJORIE E pressed the pace three wide for six furlongs then tired.

ECOLOGIST had no speed, was two wide on the turn then was steered out for room, got forced out further by SHOULD BE ILLEGAL in mid stretch then
dug in gamely and wore NIGHT GIG. NIGHT GIG hustled to stalk the pace, was four wide on the turn, drifted out under left handed urging in mid stretch
then was straightened, rallied to the front but could not stall the winner. SHOULD BE ILLEGAL chased the pace three wide to the stretch, got forced off his
path in mid stretch by NIGHT GIG then finished willingly. TIZ A SPEED BOMB set the pace while racing off the rail to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch
then weakened. EXHORTATION trailed to the turn, was three wide to the stretch, swung out widest for the drive then was also forced off his path when
NIGHT GIG drifted out and had a mild late bid. RUNKERRY was sent for speed but outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch but weakened in
the final furlong. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run involving NIGHT GIG and disqualified that one from second to fifth for interference.

Footnotes
HYDROGEN pressed the pace to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch, rallied when set down, inched to the front and held determinedly. MY
SUNSHINE never far back, saved ground to the stretch then shifted off the rail, rallied between and was along for second. STONE GROOVE chased the
pace for five furlongs, raced two wide to the stretch then shifted out and closed willingly. DEBT MONGER set the pace to the second turn, responded to the
stretch, stayed to mid stretch then was giving way late. DIRT ROAD RED had no speed, settled for a half mile, raced three then four wide on the far turn but
lacked the needed late response. FRIENDLY OUTTHEDOR had no speed, raced two wide on both turns but failed to rally when asked.
PRINCEOFTHENORTH trailed for six furlongs and was never a factor. IMPERATOR chased the pace for five furlongs then gave way.
