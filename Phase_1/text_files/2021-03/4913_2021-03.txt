Footnotes
GIO DUDE stalked from the two and three paths then challenged nearing the three eighths pole, moved to even terms past the quarter, took the nod two
deep approaching the top of the lane, dug in determinedly to turn back the game challenge of The Predictor and held off the later charge of CRAZY IDEA,
who raced well back from early contention then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, steadily progressed in the three path of the far turn, dug in to take
second the final strides and was gaining on the winner. THE PREDICTOR rated a clear lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and
was met at the rail past the quarter, gave up the nod toward the top of the stretch but dug in gamely to deep stretch before relenting. MY EMINENCE settled
off the early pace in the two and three paths, raced outside into the backstretch and bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then
flattened through the lane. BANISHMENT saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. ROSAS
WAY raced in the five path the opening turn and settled off the pace, picked up the chase into the backstretch, but faded through the far turn.

Footnotes
BARN YARD BRAT chased then challenged three wide approaching the five sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage in the three path of the turn,
but dug in for the lead mid-stretch and dueled clear later yards. STERLING CAESAR was hustled along to set a pressured pace inside, contested the edge
nearest the rail rounding the turn, gave up the nod mid-stretch then relented later yards. GRECIAN ADMIRAL stumbled at the break but picked up the chase
through the backstretch, came through the turn about the three path, was carried to the five path approaching the top of the lane, dug in for third later yards
and was gaining on the runner-up. LUCKY PENGUIN gave chase off the rail, angled to the six path approaching the top of the stretch and finished evenly to
pass rivals. ISLAND CADGER pressured the pace off the rail and dueled at a close disadvantage two deep while between horses on the turn, but dropped
back into the stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. TURNER ASHBY chased from the outside, raced in the five path most of the turn, angled to the seven
path approaching the head of the lane then flattened. MINI BOLT chased and raced at the rail on the turn, angled to the four path toward the head of the
lane, though showed little more. MAKANA gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the seven path.

well under steady handling. SONDE OF MUSIC chased and rounded the turn just off the rail, drifted a bit into the lane then dug in while continuing in an
outward drift through the lane, and held on for second. THREE BOPS chased, raced at the rail on the turn, angled to the four path approaching the top of
the stretch and finished evenly. ZIRCON ZLOTY gave chase, rounded the turn in the three and four paths then passed a rival outside. COLLEGE KID gave
chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail then weakened. DISTORTED SPLENDOR lacked speed and raced in the three path of the turn.

SILVER CASTLE angled to the inside to rate a short lead, came under pressure from the three eighths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was
steadily encouraged through the lane. PONT DU GARD saved ground just off the pace, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the
far turn then dueled through the stretch for second. RELENTLESS STRIKE stalked from the two and three paths, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole but dropped back off the rail rounding the turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. CAUSE FOR SURPRISE settled just off the
earlier pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, then flattened stride later yards.
FRENCH'S QUEST dropped well off the pace while saving ground the opening turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the
far turn and showed little further. GOODBYESEEULATER raced in the four path the first turn, entered the backstretch outside, though showed little
response. THE IRON BANK saved ground racing well back. ABLE BAKER CHARLIE raced off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn and showed
little response through the backstretch. THIRSTY ACTOR raced well off the pace mostly inside.
