Footnotes
SIDE CAR was well placed just off the speed, rallied three wide in the stretch, closed determinedly and wore down his rivals. NO TREBLE dueled on the
lead throughout, raced between horses in the stretch and held stubbornly. THE DUSTMAN dueled on the lead from the rail and gradually weakened.
WATCH THE DIP raced mid pack early, angled out in the stretch and had a late gain. FAST FAIRY raced on the inside and was no threat. VENTUS was no
factor. NO MAS broke slowly and trailed.
