Footnotes
VIENNA CODE at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, sat parked out four wide on the turn, flashed interest springing from the
five-sixteenths pole, stepped onto the head of the stretch and was given her cue, responded, closing the gap on the one to catch, collared the runner up in
the vicinity of the sixteenth pole and kicked well clear. MISSPOTOFGOLD sparred for command from the two path, put away the nemesis crossing midpoint
on the turn, extended the margin, was coming up to the three-sixteenths pole when switched to stronger handling, got reeled in a furlong later, narrowly
saved the place. STEPPIN' HAWK rode the rail, was let out a notch at the five-sixteenths pole, got spotted into path two at the top of the lane, fell short of
snagging away second. MIA CALIA worked out a tuck into the two path approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, got sent out five wide from upper to
midlane, had no punch. BETTY'S SMILE underwent a three wide journey, was under a drive coming into the stretch, gave way. QUALIFYING OFFER
contended for command on the backstretch, slid onto the inside route at the half mile pole, began to call it day a little more then a furlong down the road,
stepped into the lane and retreated to the rear.

Footnotes
SWEET MIA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from HAPPY SOPHIA to the outside through that rival's
presence, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, went clear under a drive through
to inside the sixteenth pole, then was ridden out through the final seventy yards. APPLETINI chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to safely preserve the place honors.
ANYDAYISHERDAY chased two then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the
furlong grounds, weakened in the late stages. MANI PEDI four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and passed tired rivals. HAPPY SOPHIA coaxed from the start, prompted the pace three then two wide, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. EVAN'S NICE NOW chased two to three wide, got let out nearing the quarter pole and went
four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DYNAMIC ONE assumed the role of primary pursuer after bumping with MINUTEMAN, was on hold prompting the pacesetter from path two, hitched up to
that rival as third fraction was being finalized, challenged in earnest heading for the top of the lane, wrested away the advantage making his way through the
furlong grounds, then steadily kicked away, kept to some encouragement to the end. MUTASALLEM sat reserved two wide for three-quarters, angled out
four wide entering the stretch, straightened away and ground his way into second. MINUTEMAN (GER) made contact with the winner right after the field had
been released, shook it off and grabbed the advantage, tucked along the inside route on the crown of the clubhouse turn, showed the way, shadowed by the
top one all the while, saw that rival increase its pressure as six furlongs was being rattled, got put to a drive at the quarter pole, lost the lead soon
afterwards, then lost the place in the shadow of the finish line. GOLD BEAR guided over to the rail well before arriving at the end of the backstretch, was
rated along tracking fron the pocket until the half mile pole, had the pilot begin to hand ride the mount leaving that station, got put to a drive at the
five-sixteenths pole, cut the corner, made no headway. TAPIT'S FLASHBACK hesitated at the start, got going and stayed put along the inside route, got set
down in the general area of the three-eighths pole, swung out four wide into the stretch, wound up trailing throughout.

Footnotes
RYAN'S CAT chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, advanced to assume command at the five-sixteenths patiently handled in stark contrast
to ARISTOCRATIC under a drive, got roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, went clear and was ridden out to the finish. SPIKES SHIRL three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and angled to the four path straightened away as ARISTOCRATIC
floated out a path to his inside, proved no match for the top one while along well clear for the place honors. ARISTOCRATIC a bit fractious in the gate prior
to the start, established the front just after the initial jump from the gate and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under urging at the
three-eighths as RYAN'S CAT advanced to latch on, yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and floated three
wide straightened away, displayed poor action, the rider looking down to the near side nearing the eighth pole, got protected to the finish being flashed the
stick and folded. CREATIVE STYLE chased just off the inside from the tail of the compact field, took a bad step nearing the seven-sixteenths and was
injured, was immediately placed to a protective hold and expertly pulled up near the three-eighths and was subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
ITS ALL RELEVANT retained the advantage after breaking on top, trekked its way over to the rail, getting there shortly after exiting the chute, was
loosely-pressed throwing down split after split, got set down stepping onto the head of the stretch, emerged a furlong later holding his largest lead, had it
carved into substantially by the second place finisher, but held sway. THE QUEENS JULES along the inside early, abandoned it for path three coming up to
the top of the turn, improved position during the run around the bend, was steered towards path four for the stretch drive, had a good finish down the center
of the strip en route to place honors. RUNABOUT pursued the winner from the two path, stepped into the lane, failed to make any headway. HAMMERIN
AAMER sluggish on the chute, departed the backstretch from the two path, got roused leaving the three-eighths pole, came into the stretch and came up
empty. BEACH ACCESS got set up along the inside route, was put to a hand ride going about the turn, cut the corner into the stretch and gave way.
CREATIVE PLAN steadily tired while saving ground for three-quarters, tipped out into the two path going into the stretch and backed away into last.

FOOLISH GHOST established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand three then two wide widening away through the latter portion of the
turn, spun just off the inside for home, drew off under a drive to prevail. MORNING BREEZ chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the winner while running on clear of the rest to be along second best. INSTINCTIVE
RHYTHM bobbled at the start, chased five then four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung three wide for home and improved position to
secure the show honors. SNEAKINESS chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. AMERICAN RULE six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the
turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact. TRASH TALKER forwardly placed four paths
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway, faded, swung five wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
ESPRESSO SHOT attained a forward position, disputed the pace from path two for the first three-quarters, shifted towards the third path when challenging
in earnest entering the lane, clawed up to the one to catch, ventured onward, not intimidated as the nemesis slowly made its way towards her being fed
some left side pressure, leaving the eighth pole, struck the front end a sixteenth later and edged away with determination. LOVE AND LOVE cut over to the
inside with the advantage, showed the way being coaxed along, feeling the presence of the eventual winner all the while, was turned loose for the drive
home, saw EXPRESSO SHOT whittle away at the deficit, began to move towards the middle of the strip and thus over to the top one under a left whip
starting from midstretch, yielded with approximately a sixteenth to go, crossed the wire to earn the second best designation. CRITICAL VALUE reserved two
wide for the initial half, was switched to a hand ride after entering the turn, came under a drive by the five-sixteenths marker, went into the lane and
haplessly watched the top twosome assert themselves. FIRENZE FREEDOM rode the rail for six furlongs, angled five wide into the lane, becoming the
widest of all, lacked a response. WASP forwardly placed three wide, was set down a short distance from the quarter pole, commenced the stretch one path
farther off the rail, gave out.

Footnotes
WINNERS LAUGH struck the near side stall at the start and came under hustling to establish the front shortly after and show the way in hand along the
inside, came under pressure midway on the turn and got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat from
a pair and edged away under a drive to prevail. SINFUL DANCER brushed the near side stall at the start, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest. MR. BUCKLEY broke in at the start,
chased three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive prominent to the eighth pole, then
weakened in the late stages while safely along for the show honors. TRIPLE AMERICANO coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until tucked
inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. ME 'N SAP chased
just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. BLACK IRISH chased three wide under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. MICRO ME stumbled badly at the start pecking the ground and recovering
inwards conceding three to four lengths before settling into stride, chased two then three wide down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn put to
coaxing three furlongs from home, swung five wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. NOBLE CONQUEST four then three wide in
pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, went four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
