Footnotes
OUR BERMUDA bumped soundly with a rival at the start, went to the front, set the pace while inside to the two path, inched clear into upper stretch,
responded well under a right-handed crop in the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. BOLD ZARB was hustled from the start, prompted the
pace between horses in the two to three path, was asked on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and was outfinished while well clear for the
place. MISS YOU JO broke very slow and spotted the front several lengths, went two to three wide on the first turn, settled comfortably down the
backstretch, saved ground under urging on the far turn and lacked the needed response while just able to get the show. GUITAR KING was hustled from the
start, saved ground on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, chased in the two path under strong urging on the far turn and tired then just missed
the show. RICHIE GARY went around the first turn in the four path, stalked the pace on the outside, was urged along passing the seven-sixteenths, chased
three then four wide on the far turn and also tired. STRIKING STAR was bumped into the first turn then caught five wide on that bend, settled at the rear,
was urged along in the two path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to threaten. MUSICAL MAN broke out and bumped
soundly with a foe, bumped with another rival while carried out into the first turn, went four wide on that bend, settled on the outside, was urged along
passing the half-mile pole, went four then five wide on the far turn and came up empty. SILVER KING broke a step slow, was carried out into the first turn
then caught six wide on that bend, settled on the outside, was urged five then six wide on the far turn and failed to respond. M V P MOOKIE broke out then
was hustled, became hard to control when taken in hand early, checked while lugging out into the first turn, checked sharply shortly thereafter, lugged out to
the five path by late on that bend, dropped to the rear before the half-mile pole and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
DICTATOR was hustled to the lead, set the clear pace in the two path, drew off on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and widened under
strong urging. KILLEEN went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, moved out near the seven-sixteenths, was urged three wide on the
far turn and secured the place while no match for the winner. AQUALITYINDIVIDUAL went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged four
wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response while just up for the show. SKYCRAFT raced inside early on the first turn then shifted three wide, was
urged along while last but one on the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn and just missed the show. KING OF CANDY went five wide on the first
turn, moved in while off the pace on the backstretch, steadied behind a rival into the far turn, was roused while two then three wide on that bend and also
lacked the needed response. CATALOGUE went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while dropping from the two path to the
rail on the far turn and tired. GATO AMERICANO went around the first turn in the two path, settled well back in the field, was urged along while inside early
on the far turn then moved to the two path, checked behind a foe inside the quarter-pole and was no factor. CITALI dropped well behind while two to three
wide, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten. GO FOR MOONSHINE went three wide on the first turn, followed the
solo leader down the backstretch, came up empty while inside on the far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
OFFICE PARTY was well placed just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, shifted three while asked at the quarter-pole,
rallied through a sizable opening in upper stretch, closed well to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under confident handling. FAIRCHILD
tucked into the four path on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, came under urging while four wide on the far turn, rallied six wide into the stretch,
gained the lead inside the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished but willingly earned the place.
DANCEFORTHEEMPIRE broke a step slow, went three to four wide on the turns, swung seven wide into the stretch and improved position to get the show.
GATHERED FLOWERS stalked the pace on the outside in the two to three path, was asked on the far turn, took the lead while spinning four wide into the
stretch, lost the advantage inside the three-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. SPEED LANE was reserved on the inside,
swung five wide into the stretch then raced behind foes before being roused around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. SUM KINDA
PRETTY went four wide on the first turn, was rated towards the front on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and
tired. SPARE CASH hit the inside of the gate at the start, was taken under a strong hold early, went two to three wide on the turns, came under urging at the
five-sixteenths, swung six wide into the stretch and came up empty. MARY OF BETHANY saved ground on the first turn, moved out while reserved at the
rear, went three to four wide on the far turn, dropped in after turning into the stretch and failed to rally. HONOR AND JUSTICE was given some pops of the
crop on the initial straightaway, rounded the first turn in the two path, was given some more props of the crop early on the backstretch, settled towards the
rear, went two to three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. WALK ME HOME went to the front, set the pace on the inside, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, lost the lead into the stretch and faded. (Rail at 16 Feet)

pace, moved closer while four wide on the far turn, rallied six wide into the stretch, closed well to make a bid outside the eighth-pole, fought with the winner
in the final furlong and missed while able to get the place. MORE GOOD TIMES broke a step slow then angled in early, went two to three wide on the turns,
swung six wide into the stretch then moved further out and finished with good energy for the show. FLASHING RED went three to four wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, was asked while four to five wide on the far turn, made a bid into upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and was
out-kicked then missed the show. YLIKEDIS saved ground on the first turn, settled well off the pace, went around the far turn in the two path, swung six wide
into the stretch then moved further out, lacked optimal room behind horses in the drive and finished willingly. TEENAGE KICKS went three wide on the first
turn, settled off the pace, was roused while two to three wide on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong and
lacked the needed kick. WEST BANK BABY rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was put to a drive in
upper stretch and also lacked the needed response. PERFECT REINS rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, went three to four
wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. GINNY B went three then two wide on the first turn, set the clear pace while in
hand, came under pressure while inside to the two path on the far turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole and faded. MIZZEN BEAU went two then three wide
on the first turn, was rated in second position, chased three to four wide on the far turn and came up empty. AIFE dwelt very badly and just stood in the
gate, came out over a furlong behind the rest of the field, saved ground on the turn and trailed while driven to the wire. (Rail at 16 Feet) FOLLOWING A

Footnotes
GUILTY LOVER went four wide early on the first turn then dropped to the two path, settled towards the rear, moved closer while shifting from the inside to
the three path on the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch and closed strongly to win going away. LAST TO KNOW went three wide on the first turn,
settled well off the pace, moved closer under urging while five wide on the far turn, was driven six wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the place.
BANQUET CHEF broke out and hit the gate, went two to three wide on the first turn, settled outside on the backstretch, ranged up three to four wide on the
far turn, took the lead before the quarter-pole, shook clear under a drive into the stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while clear for the
show. GREY SLOAN was hustled from the start, went three to four wide on the first turn, moved in while settling off the pace on the backstretch, went two
then three wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and weakened. KAMARA VISION went four then five wide on the first turn, settled on
the outside, was urged four wide on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. MISTA VALENTINE went to the front,
raced four then three wide on the first turn, set the pace, vied in the two path on the far turn, lost the lead before the quarter-pole and tired. WIDDLE ZEE
went three then two wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the inside of the leader, dropped back while inside on the far turn, moved out in upper
stretch and came up empty. BASSETT raced inside to the two path on the turns and was no factor. MULTIDIMENSIONAL went three then four wide on the
first turn, settled towards the rear, went five to six wide for most of the far turn, dropped to the four path late on that bend and failed to respond. RUNNIN
BRAVE went five then four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, came up empty on the far turn and faltered.
