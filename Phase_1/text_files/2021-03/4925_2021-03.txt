Footnotes
FLAT RATE took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to set a clear pace, came under pressure past the five sixteenths pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn and was steadily encouraged to hold off IHEARUKNOCKIN, who came through the opening turn in the three path and stalked
into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail and moved to within a length of the winner
mid-stretch, but ultimately, needed a bit more. TOTAL FUTBOL settled off the pace and off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the
far turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. SUNMAN rounded the opening turn about the four path and raced outside into the backstretch,
bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path but showed little more. TEATOE saved ground the first turn and faded past
the three eighths pole.

Footnotes
MACKENZIE'S STAR rated close inside the opening turn, started a three wide bid approaching the five sixteenths pole and dug in leaving the far turn to get
up the final yards. NORTHERN HEAT settled off the early pace in the two and three paths then raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, took the nod just inside the quarter, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the far turn but was caught in the final yards. CHARITABLE
ROSE saved early ground then bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path most of the far turn, angled to the six path leaving the turn and
was along for third the final yards. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW stalked from the inside then picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, dueled to a
slim brief lead approaching the quarter, but was caught past the pole and weakened leaving the far turn. CASTLEINTHEMEADOW was reluctant to load
then stalked from the three path, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, but weakened into the far turn. OUR BAD GIRL closed to the lead
at the three quarter pole and rated the pace off the rail, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was caught toward the quarter pole, dropped
back midway on the far turn and weakened.

LIVE THE MOMENT took the lead between horses nearing the three quarter pole and rated a clear lead, widened through the backstretch and continued to
extend that margin with steady urging, though, was taken in hand late. SIGNATURE DISH was bumped lightly at the break then stalked two deep, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, proved no match for the winner, though, held on for second. CALLINGHERCOLLINS
settled off the pace and off the rail, bid leaving the half mile pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and finished evenly. MISS CHEENY was bumped
lightly at the break and raced well off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off the
rail and passed rivals in the lane. LINCOLN CENTER broke awkwardly and made light contact with Signature Dish then saved ground off the pace, picked
up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response. BORROWED ANGEL showed little response through the backstretch. EASY'S
FINAL ROSE came away awkwardly and made contact with Miss Cheeny, appeared a bit rank early and dropped well off early contention.

Footnotes
YESIKNOWWHOIAM stalked off the rail then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled for the nod two deep midway on the far turn and dug in
determinedly to edge out the game effort of IN THE GOSPEL, who rated a short lead inside, dueled the winner leaving the three eighths pole, gave up the
nod at the rail midway on the far turn, but dug in gamely to deep stretch before relenting; grudgingly. PONTICELLO settled just off the pace and off the rail
the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for
third. LET'S GET STARTED raced well off the early pace while saving ground then angled to the outside into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for show. ALLOVERBUTTHECRYIN saved ground off the pace,
picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened in the stretch duel. ITSAHATTATACK rounded the first
turn in the three and four paths, raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response. ASK ME HOW IKNOW was not a factor.

Footnotes
BRIAN'S AVENUE took the lead two deep approaching the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace, pulled himself clear toward the five sixteenths, came
under pressure nearing the quarter pole and raced at the rail through the far turn, then widened under steady stretch handling. SWISS SUNRISE settled off
the pace about the three path then mounted a three wide bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced in range of the winner about the three path on the
far turn but proved no match in the lane. RIGHTEOUS MAN saved ground racing well off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved position in
the four path of the far turn and was along for third later yards. SKY GAZER R V F set the pace most of the opening quarter mile then stalked inside from
the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths but dropped back approaching the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn.
NEW AFLEET raced well off the pace while saving early ground and showed little response through the backstretch. LONDON WEREWOLF saved ground
off the pace the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn.

AZZURRA saved ground off the pace the opening turn then eased outward into the backstretch, bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole and closed to
the lead two deep nearing the head of the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and widened later yards. MABEL rounded the first turn in the three path then
stalked four wide into the backstretch, closed to the front approaching the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn but was
caught toward the head of the lane, dropped back mid-stretch and had to settle for second best. ONE SMART COOKIE saved ground off the pace, lost
momentum while in tight nearest the rail approaching the quarter pole, recovered stride through the far turn but showed little more in the lane. VINTAGE
GIN stalked the early pace and took a brief slim lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole, but was caught toward the three eighths and faded off the rail
on the far turn. WONDER CHARM surged to the front and angled to the inside to set the early pace, was caught approaching the seven sixteenths pole and

Footnotes
WILD CAPPUCINO stalked two deep the first turn then took a short lead nearing the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths,
dueled clear at the rail on the far turn and was steadily encouraged to widen. RUN ON ENERGY rated close to the early pace in the three and four paths,
challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and continued close through the far turn, but dropped back into the stretch and had to settle for second best.
LIL SWEETHEART set the pace at the rail the first turn, was caught nearing the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the
far turn at the rail, then weakened. WHIZ PASS raced in the four path the first turn then entered the backstretch outside, picked up the chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little more. WAKES UP HAPPY settled off the pace and off the rail, eased out with a bid
into the backstretch but showed little response. CITY BIRD FLYING rounded the opening turn about the five path and was never a factor.
