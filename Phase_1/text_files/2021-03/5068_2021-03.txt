Footnotes
RATTLESNAKEROSE broke readily, was urged between foes dictating the pace on a narrow margin just off the rail racing into the turn, then held sway to
the end under firm left, then right handed pressure to prevail. APRIL FOG, in touch three wide prompting the pace racing through the backstretch into the
turn, proved no match late. SOLD ON SALSA, urged to a forward placing along the rail tracking just off the pacesetter, steadily faded into upper stretch.
I'LLMAKEYOUSMILE, a bit outpaced while five wide in early stages, failed to menace. NOBLE INTENTIONS switched out four wide tracking off the first
flight racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY CURLS, bumped, then held up avoiding tight quarters at the start, angled to the inside dropping off the second flight, steadily gathered
momentum racing into the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch, took over under pressure and was taken in hand once the issue was decided.
ORNERY ANGEL, urged along pursuing the leaders three deep racing into the bend, moved to wrest the advantage racing into upper stretch but proved no
match when confronted by the winner. CLARIST, urged between foes from the outset disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the turn, weakened
leaving midstretch. TEGLA settled outside a rival in the last flight early, angled inside rivals racing into the turn and continued with an even effort to improve
position. LUNA QUEEN shied inwards bumping the eventual winner at the start, tracked off the first flight racing four wide between foes to the turn and
steadily faded into the lane. TREASURED INFO tracked off the first flight five wide racing through the backstretch, continued five wide into the lane but
proved no threat. RETURN THE FAVOR, caught six wide in early stages, failed to menace. ANDREA'S WORRY, urged inside foes disputing the pace along
the rail racing into the turn, was pulled up after a half in some distress and was vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
BABY GUNDIN exchanged light contact with RANSOMS REWARD at the start, was prompted to a forward placing between foes tracking just off the
pacesetter racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady bid three deep between foes to challenge for command nearing upper stretch and edged
forward to a narrow advantage in the closing stages under firm handling. CONTINUALLY broke readily, was urged inside rivals to prompt the pace while
conceding the lead, pressed the issue along the rail on the far turn past midstretch but was just outkicked. RANSOMS REWARD broke through the gate
prior to the start, exchanged contact with the eventual winner at the break, was urged between foes to gain a narrow advantage dictating the pace just off
the inside, dueled between foes into the far turn to upper stretch and weakened late while holding a rival for a share. NAKIBEYA, caught four wide racing to
the first turn tracking just off the pace, continued in that path into the far turn and faded in the drive. AS IT SEEMS tracked off the first flight along the inside
racing to the backstretch but retreated early.

Footnotes
CHATTIN WITH JENNY was rated just off the second flight near the inside, split foes racing into the turn, steadily advanced on the pacesetter to wrest the
advantage late, then just held TENERIFE MOON to the end under firm encouragement. The latter settled along the inside early, shifted out five wide on the
bend commencing a steady rally, then continued in that path to late stages to just miss. BELLA SERENA, urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail, held
sway on a clear advantage to upper stretch and gave out in late stretch. TETON THAI tracked the pacesetter three wide between foes in second flight
racing to the turn and faded in late stages. RACHEL'S WISH tracked off the second flight between foes to the turn and continued evenly. INDY PRINCESS
KOKO tracked off the second flight racing four wide into the turn but had no closing bid. CHILLIN LADY, forwardly placed along the rail, faded into the
stretch. FLORESITA tracked off the second flight six wide in early stages, angled to the inside nearing the turn but had no rally. MI TIA REGIS settled last
early and proved no threat. DEESSE was a brief factor seven wide in early stages, shifted inwards nearing the turn and steadily faded. MISS UTOPIA
dropped out early.

Footnotes
OBIWAN, reserved while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, advanced to contention along the rail nearing the far turn, shifted out splitting foes
nearing upper stretch, switched out four wide in the stretch and continued with a solid late response to prevail in time under pressure. FOOD AND WINE
sped to the lead, dictated the pace a bit off the rail, resisted the winner's bid to late stages and just missed. SOARING BIRD angled to the inside tracking
just off the pacesetter, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. KING OTTOKAR angled inwards to track the leader between foes in
second flight, shifted three wide in the drive but had no final kick. DANCERONTHEBEACH switched out early to track off the second flight racing three, then
four wide into the lane but offered no rally. KING LEONARDO was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch but offered no closing bid.
JUAN BOLY tracked the leaders three wide off the second flight but came up empty racing into the far turn. KRAMDEN settled between foes and dropped
out early.

SHALL RETURN tracked off the first flight outside rivals racing three deep on the backstretch, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and produced a late
surge to just edge INEDATEQUILA in time under firm handling. The latter was urged inside rivals disputing the pace, shook clear in upper stretch but was
collared nearing the wire. CELESTIAL ORB settled off the second flight on the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch, split foes leaving midstretch
then angled inwards to narrowly prevail for a share on the wire. MY GIRL ANNIE tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the turn and continued
evenly in the closing stages. MULBERRY, in touch prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn, weakened in late stages. LADY
BREANNA tracked the pace inside foes in second flight and steadily faded into the turn. EYE ON THE FINISH trailed throughout.

PYTHONESS broke slowly, angled to the rail leaving the chute, made steady progress inside foes to gain terms with the second flight nearing the far turn,
split rivals just off the inside to challenge for the lead nearest the rail racing into upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and drove clear.
MADEMOISELLE NOVA tracked off the first flight near the inside, then between foes on the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing through the stretch
while being prompted to challenge and prevailed for the place honors. TAKE TO THE SKIES, forwardly placed stalking a rival's pace to the backstretch,
pressed the issue on the far turn to gain a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, briefly contested the winner's bid but yielded late. DANCE RECITAL
settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, advanced to contention racing four wide through the far turn to upper stretch but flattened out
once entering the lane. C'EST PARTI tracked off the first flight outside rivals to the backstretch and faded after a half. ORIOLE sped to the lead along the
inside, set the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled for command inside foes to upper stretch and abruptly gave way. BORN MEAN, reserved
between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, dropped out early.

Footnotes
FOX ROX tracked the pace, angled out through the turn three wide, came four wide to bid, then made a steady gain and drew off late. GREAT BLAKE rated
back in the early going, saved ground through the turn on the two path, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out midstretch, then closed well
late to gain the place. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and lacked the
needed late kick. R BOY BODE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin to the final furlong, then weakened and held a share.
REBOUNDER stalked the pace in the early going, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path and flattened. DERBY CITY allowed to settle,
saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch and evened out. WHERE'S JORDAN allowed to settle, looped three and four
wide through the turn, angled widest once in the stretch, then passed tiring rivals. IMPERIAL BREW ran evenly. SOLITARY JACK well placed and between
rivals, held position through the turn, then faded in the drive. RAOFTHESUN was never involved. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER OF
SOLITARY JACK AGAINST THE RIDER OF R BOY BODE WAS NOT ALLOWED.
