Footnotes
COMMISSIONESS chased leader four wide on the backstretch, continued four wide on the turn, entered stretch in the four path, overtook leader with a
sixteenth to go, dueled with rallying rival and just held. MISS MOZART chased leader three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn,
entered stretch in the three path and gamely rallied in between horses to just miss. BLUE BUTTERFLY cleared rivals on the backstretch, continued clear on
the turn, margin reduced on the turn but still clear at the top of the lane, overtaken by rival with a sixteenth to go and kept to task to save third. UNTAPPED
POTENTIAL chased leader in between rivals on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and out-moved on the turn falling back into last while still two wide
and not crossed over by clear rival outside of her, entered stretch in the two path and kept to task while never threatening for the win spot. DORITA'S
LEMON chased inside throughout, in rang entering the stretch and lacked needed punch to improve position.
