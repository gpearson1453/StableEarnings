Footnotes
COMMITTEEMAN broke readily to gain the advantage, angled inwards dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail into the turn, then
continued with a steady effort into the lane to go clear under firm handling. PITAMAN shifted out at the start while being prompted to a forward placing along
the inside racing through the backstretch, conceded some position under patient handling on the turn, shifted out three wide racing through the stretch and
prevailed for the place honors. SIXTY ONE switched out three deep early while being urged to a forward placing, moved to challenge the pacesetter nearing
upper stretch but proved no match leaving midstretch. ALL FOOLS DAY, off slowly, switched outside rivals racing into the turn and continued evenly to late
stages. VILLAGE PREACHER settled outside foes racing through the backstretch and never seriously menaced. D TACHYON settled between foes in the
last flight and faded from contention early. ROYAL BIZ, urged to contention four wide tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn, emptied out into upper
stretch.

Footnotes
WILLIAM CROTTY, forward placed between foes racing to the backstretch, was held up avoiding close quarters midway through the backstretch, angled
inside the pacesetter while being prompted to advance on that rival racing into the turn, bid for command racing past the quarter mile marker, shifted out
disputing the issue on a narrow advantage racing through the stretch and just held ENGLISH LAUGHTER under firm right handed pressure. The latter,
urged to the lead a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, dictated the pace into the far turn, grudgingly resisted the winner's bid while being carried out to
the four path racing past midstretch but continued to dispute the issue to the end. GRAY BEAU settled into stride shifting a bit off the inside racing to the
backstretch, angled to the rail on the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch gaining position but finished evenly late. ONE STOP SHOP angled to the inside
racing to the first turn tracking just off the second flight, was prompted to gain position inside foes after a half, switched out entering the far turn but had no
closing response. WHISTLE ME HOME, caught four wide racing through the first turn while being prompted to maintain striking distance, angled inwards
entering the backstretch prompting the pacesetter to the second bend and gave way. NED DEVINE settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and
proved no threat. PURIMETER flashed brief pace three wide between foes racing to the first turn, was eased back to track the leaders between rivals but
faded early.

Footnotes
FOGGY FLIGHT was urged between foes, then inside a rival disputing the pace through the backstretch, shook clear entering the turn and maintained a
commanding advantage to the end under pressure. QUIET NO MORE, off slowly, was settled last to the turn, was prompted to advance four, then five wide
racing to upper stretch and continued well enough to edge a rival for the place honors late. BABIE MONSTER tracked off the second flight while shifting out
early, then improved position three, then four wide racing into the stretch while being just outkicked for second. ANIMAUXSELLE settled outside foes off the
second flight, angled inwards on the turn to split foes entering the stretch and passed some tiring rivals. TALE OF V K broke sharply, forced the pace
outside foes racing into the turn, continued in pursuit of the winner through the bend and gave way in the drive. MAST COVE, urged to a forward placing
along the inside in the opening stages, switched out racing into the turn to make brief progress three wide but came up empty midstretch. GIPSEY
SORCERESS was a brief factor outside a rival in second flight and gave way early.

Footnotes
GEARHEAD was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out racing through the far turn to split foes three wide entering
upper stretch challenging for command, drifted out markedly through the closing stages but went well clear under pressure. RUDIGER settled outside foes
in the last flight racing to the backstretch, split foes three deep leaving the midway point of the far turn, swung out five wide entering upper stretch and
continued with a steady late response to prove best of the others. TALE OF THE NILE was rated off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to
upper stretch, then split rivals just off the inside in late stages to prevail for a share. PUDDING, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the
pacesetter to the backstretch, shifted out three wide on the far turn while advancing to challenge for command nearing upper stretch but couldn't sustain that
bid past midstretch. WILLING TO SPEED, caught a bit wide tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide on
the far turn to upper stretch but had no closing response. THE CURT FOX (GB) settled along the inside early, angled out five wide entering the stretch and
gained some position while making no real impression. HERECOMESYOURMAN, pulling against restraint and held up between foes racing to the
backstretch, lacked a closing response. TOSS, rank under restraint, then steadied along the inside racing to the first turn, switched out nearing the
backstretch to race five wide through the backstretch and came up empty entering the far turn. BOURBON TAN switched out three deep racing to the first
turn while prompted to a forward placing, was urged to terms with the pacesetter forcing the issue midway through the backstretch and gave way abruptly
between foes entering the lane. NOTORIOUS NICK sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside leaving the chute, dueled for command inside foes
through the backstretch into the far turn and gave way leaving midstretch.

Footnotes
UNION APPRECIATION, off slowly, was urged to regain position inside foes racing through the backstretch, came through along the rail to challenge for
command in upper stretch, contested the issue in a prolonged drive to late stages but narrowly prevailed in time under firm encouragement. DISCO'S
BRIDGE was urged to gain the lead racing a bit off the rail in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin racing into the turn, was taken
in hand momentarily avoiding a loose rival when losing his path to that foe racing into upper stretch but continued to grudgingly contest the issue outside a
rival to the end to just miss. HE HAD A SECRET tracked the leader outside rivals in second flight racing to the turn and continued to advance three deep in
the closing stages to make a mild gain late. ZAMAN tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn, then shifted four wide entering the stretch
while finished evenly. TALON hopped at the start, was settled last, saved ground to upper stretch but made no real impression on the leaders. COUSIN
switched outside foes early while being rated off the second flight and lacked a closing response. BAHAMIAN PARK was rated between foes leading the
second flight out of striking distance racing to the turn but faded early. HIMELSTEIN stumbled at the start, dislodging his rider. FOLLOWING THE RACE
THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
GOLDEN OLDIE was rated along the rail stalking off the first flight racing into the backstretch, switched outside the leader while moving to challenge racing
into the far turn, took over while shifting to the three path in upper stretch, then widened her advantage under pressure. SWEET MARY LOU angled inwards
to track off the leaders leaving the chute, was bumped soundly by GRAPEVINE on the first turn, recovered to track the leaders along the rail to the
backstretch, gained some position along the inside on the far turn, then switched out to prevail for the place honors between foes in late stages. LULLABY
LAND, caught four wide racing to the first turn, tracked the pacesetter outside foes in second flight, was prompted to advance three wide on the far turn,
shifted four wide in upper stretch but continued well enough to prevail for a share. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY raced four deep between foes through the
chute, shied inwards entering the first turn making solid contact with BAROLA, was righted while pulling her way to a clear advantage along the inside racing
through the backstretch, briefly resisted the winner's challenge nearing upper stretch but yielded leaving the furlong marker. BAROLA, caught in tight
quarters, then bumped soundly racing into the first turn, momentarily dislodging her rider from his irons, was collected to track off the second flight outside a
rival racing to the backstretch, then continued evenly between foes into the lane. GRAPEVINE raced between foes while angling inwards a bit leaving the
chute, was bumped by BAROLA while being forced into SWEET MARY LOU racing into the first turn, was collected to track off the second flight and
continued evenly into the stretch while proving no threat. VOW SAVER was settled inside foes, then steadied avoiding traffic racing into the first turn and
never gained contention. VARSITY FLYGIRL, held up leaving the chute avoiding close quarters, angled to the inside racing as part of the last flight to the
backstretch but never proved a threat. STILLHER, off slowly, was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace
thereafter. YES IT'S FREE, urged to prompt the pace between foes racing to the first turn, lost ground to the leaders entering the backstretch and gave way
abruptly approaching the far turn. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDERS OF GRAPEVINE AND BAROLA LODGED CLAIMS OF FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF THEUNCAPTUREDLADY WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE FIRST TURN. AFTER
REVIEWING THE INCIDENT, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED THEUNCAPTUREDLADY FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER SIXTH.

Footnotes
BOLD PAYNTER broke outwards bumping GENERAL PADDY, was righted, then angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter from well out of striking
distance as part of the second flight, shifted out on the far turn, was prompted to close the gap on the leader nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage
entering the lane and went clear through the closing stages under firm right handed pressure. TONY SMALL tracked off the second flight inside foes, then
between rivals racing to the far turn, was prompted to split foes three deep racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for the place
honors. GENERAL PADDY, bumped, then squeezed between foes at the start, settled last while angling to the inside, was prompted to advance inside foes
entering the far turn, then shifted out to prevail for a share late. CONTRAFLOW sprinted clear of the field racing to the backstretch, held sway on a
commanding margin racing to the far turn, but gave out once headed in upper stretch. TIZ RYE TIME, bumped, then forced into GENERAL PADDY at the
start, settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. BOW AND ARROW tracked off the second flight outside foes to
the first turn, was prompted to make brief progress three deep entering the far turn but came up empty in the drive. OBIWAN broke inwards bumping TIZ
RYE TIME, was righted to track outside a rival in second flight racing to the backstretch but dropped out early. UNCLE DREW tracked off the second flight
between foes while being three deep after a half and faded early.

Footnotes
SURVEY (IRE), carried out by MR. WHO racing into the first turn after securing a position just off the leaders, was rated dropping off the second flight racing
to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage while shifting inwards nearing midstretch and edged
clear under firm handling. AGRIPINO, forwardly placed along the inside racing to the backstretch, continued inside a rival as part of the second flight racing
to the far turn, conceded some position under patient handling while awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, switched outside foes entering the lane to
bid three deep in the closing stages and edged a rival for the place honors. MR. WHO, prompted to a forward placing along the inside, drifted out entering
the first turn carrying out the eventual winner, moved to terms with a rival to track just off the pacesetter to the second bend, advanced to challenge for
command nearing upper stretch, shifted to the inside once gaining the advantage between calls entering upper stretch but weakened in the drive. FLORIDA
EXPRESS settled between foes in the last flight to the backstretch, then split rivals just off the inside racing into the stretch to make some belated progress.
IN HONOR OF ARTIE tracked off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while switching outside
foes entering the lane but had no closing bid. TITHED, urged to the lead racing to the first turn, set the pace on a clear margin along the rail racing to the far
turn and gave way entering upper stretch. GEORGIA PINES, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, never gained contention. VICTORY TOUR
settled outside foes and proved no threat. RIVER KNIGHT, caught four wide between foes leaving the chute, tracked off the second flight outside foes to the
backstretch and faded after a half. ACTION WARRIOR, off slowly, was caught wide racing to the first turn and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
LIBERTARIAN took up a position tracking just off the pacesetter nearest the rail racing through the backstretch, saved ground on the turn continuing under
patient handling, was prompted to advance along the rail when presented an opening in upper stretch, came through tight quarters in late stages but just
struck the front in time to prevail under firm right handed pressure. MAGICAL TALE was urged to gain the lead in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a
narrow margin racing just off the rail into the turn, maintained a narrow advantage dueling for command in a prolonged skirmish racing through the stretch
and just missed. NATIVE HAWK, prompted to forward placing between foes racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue between into upper stretch
and continued grudgingly three deep to the wire while just outkicked by the top pair. SACRAMENTO Q, forced into the path of SECRET LIFE STYLE at the
start, was settled outside foes tracking off the second flight racing into the turn, angled inwards racing through the stretch but continued willingly between
foes to gain position to the end. QUICK ENTRY angled in sharply at the start to gain a forward placing racing just off the pacesetter, was urged to prompt
the leader three deep into the turn, was fanned four wide midstretch and weakened late. LEGACY AZTECA tracked off the first flight three deep racing
through the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide on the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and faded in the drive. OX TROT tracked
off the first flight racing a bit off the rail to the turn and faded into upper stretch. WAPITI WAY settled well off the leaders along the inside racing through the
backstretch and proved no threat. SECRET LIFE STYLE, shut off at the start, settled last racing to the turn and never menaced thereafter.

Footnotes
MONEY AND HONEY broke sharply to gain a clear advantage, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail into the turn, shook clear
entering upper stretch and maintained that advantage under firm right handed pressure. QUICK CONVERSATION was urged between rivals pursuing the
pacesetter in the opening stages, lost some position when caught in tight quarters entering the turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and
continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors. BEACHSIDE BUNNY, bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight along the inside racing
into the turn, then swung out four wide in upper stretch to edge rivals for a share late. AWESOME VIEW broke inwards bumping BEACHSIDE BUNNY, was
righted, then urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter into the turn but weakened midstretch. BONNY BELL, a bit reluctant to load, was urged three
deep between foes pursuing the pacesetter through the opening stages, was shuffled out of tight quarters approaching the bend and continued evenly
between foes into the stretch. BRAMBLE BUSH, carried out by THAWED at the start, was settled last racing to the turn, then swung six wide into upper
stretch but proved no threat. LADY BLAKENEY ducked out at the start into the path of THAWED, was righted, then urged along four wide to gain striking
distance in the opening stages, angled in racing into the turn pursuing the pacesetter between foes and gave way in upper stretch. SUNDANCE PEAK shied
outwards avoiding BRAMBLE BUSH at the start, settled outside foes and never menaced thereafter. SHE CAN'T HELP IT broke slowly while caught wide
early and proved no threat. THAWED, forced out at the start by LADY BLAKENEY into the path of BRAMBLE BUSH, was righted to make brief pursuit of
the pacesetter racing five wide to the turn but gave way early.
