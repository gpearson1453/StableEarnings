CAMGO showed speed from the outset, pressed outside in the three path, took over in early stretch, held and returned with the saddle slipped far back. NO
HITTER ducked out into STILL CHIEF leaving the gate, moved to a short lead inside the winner before going a furlong, stayed out from the rail around the
turn and continued with good courage once displaced. STILL CHIEF was bumped leaving the gate, lagged early, raced two wide around the turn and closed
a gap from the outside. CLEAR PROSPERITY raced the three path and failed to matter. MAGICIAN'SCALENDAR chased the top two for a half then
stopped.

Footnotes
PATAZ moved two wide to command midway on the turn then drove clear through the lane. SAN ELIJO was slow to settle then finished willingly outside.
INDIGESTION moved closer in the three path in early stretch but lacked a strong closing. IRONBOUND wasn't far back along the inside early, angled out,
gave his best into the final furlong then weakened. CONQUEST PRANKSTER made the early pace outside, angled to the rail on the turn and tired.
CHEESE ON threw his head to the inside as the doors opened, hit the gate, went in the air, left about a dozen lengths behind the field then couldn't catch
up.

two wide on the final turn but lacked the needed closing response. MIA ANGELINA advanced two wide on the final turn and continued evenly through the

EYES OF ZEUS made the pace along the rail, ran out while moving clear into the stretch and was all out to hold. BOURBON AGOGO was unhurried, began
a run two wide into the far turn, swung wide into the stretch, tried outside the winner through late stretch but wasn't enough. MARC WELLS was slow early,
rallied the rail, gave his best in deep stretch but hung. LAST BOW ran out while showing speed into the first turn, moved two wide to a short lived lead
before three-quarters then weakened. ELECTRIC HEAT made a three wide run into contention on the final turn then flattened out. RINGLE BELLE was
finished early. COSMIC COWBOY trailed.
