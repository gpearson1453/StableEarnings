RUVIES IN TIME away in good order, pressed the issue from the two path, turned into the lane directly abreast of the nemesis, responded when given her
cue, out-dueling MALIBU MISCHIEF over the the next sixteenth to strike the front end, steadily extended the margin under good handling. FAIR REGIS
broke forwardly placed despite stumbling at the start, recovered and tracked the front runners while taking the inside route, angled three wide coming into
the stretch, straightened away and rallied for the place. MALIBU MISCHIEF grabbed the advantage after the field had been sent off and running, gradually
made her way over to the rail, getting there by the conclusion of the backstretch, had the winner out in the two path whittle away at the deficit during the run
around the bend, got put to the test at the three-sixteenths pole, succumbed, then after weakening in a steadfast manner, lost out on second. RUDE
AWAKING underwent a two wide pursuit, fanned out into path four from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, had no punch. LEM ME HAVE IT rode
the rail to no avail.

AMERICAN POWER bobbled at the break under coaxing and brushed with TRUE PALACE before establishing the front showing the way early on under the
close watchful eye of PETE'S PLAY CALL to the outside, had that rival advance and dueled with that foe into and through the turn coming under coaxing
three furlongs from home, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in continuing to knock heads through to the sixteenth marker in game fashion
before inching away in the late stages to score. PETE'S PLAY CALL away to the front from the start, prompted the pace from the outside in the early going
before advancing to challenge for the front into the turn, dueled through the bend patiently handled as his main rival got busy along the inside, got set down
spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive dueling through the stretch to the sixteenth pole fighting on gallant but was ultimately
rebuffed at the end and shaken off in the final jumps to the finish. AMERICAN RULE five then four wide in pursuit coaxed along from the five-sixteenths,
angled six wide into upper stretch and kept on under a drive to secure the show honors. MAD MUNNYS coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside
briefly before tipping out to the four path in behind the duel with five and a half furlongs remaining, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and angled out
to swing five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. TRUE PALACE got brushed at the start by AMERICAN POWER, chased along the inside
under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

LETMETAKETHISCALL sparred for command from the two path, took over from JUMP FOR JOY as the half was being completed, stepped into the lane,
drew off as much the best, handily. DOVEY LOVEY pursued the pace three wide, was under a drive heading home, haplessly watch the winner assert
herself while securing second. LADY BY CHOICE two wide on the backstretch, rode the rail beginning from the top of the turn before tipping back into the
two path in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, went into the stretch and made no headway. JUMP FOR JOY remained stationed along the inside
route, vied for control matched up with the winner for the initial half, failed to respond when called upon for more after releasing the advantage, faded down
the lane.

BEARS MAFIA got hustled from the gate to knock heads briefly with STORM ADVISORY before establishing sole command five furlongs from home,
showed the way under pressure from that same rival to the outside coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three then two wide into upper
stretch straightened away shaking off his main pace foe briefly safely in front before confronted by the eventual runner up, dug in gamely to fend off that
challenger to the finish. SQUARE SHOOTER four then three wide in pursuit under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied
to issue a challenge latching on to the top one a furlong from home, dug in under a drive unable to get on even terms and was ultimately repelled to the
wire. STORM ADVISORY coaxed from the start, knocked heads with BEARS MAFIA for the front four paths off the inside until eased off five furlongs out to
apply pressure to the outside, tucked three wide through the turn and got placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper
stretch, got shaken off straightened away and kept on to secure the show honors. SUMMER BOURBON coaxed along three then two wide in pursuit, spun
three wide into upper stretch and weakened. SPIKES SHIRL five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, went six wide at the

Footnotes
DUBLINORNOTHIN away well, stalked the pace from the three path, between foes for most of the trip leading up to the five-sixteenths marker, was given
her cue challenging in earnest a furlong down the road, wrested away the advantage with under an eighth to go, held late to hold sway. MOVIE SCORE at a
considerable distance from off the rail throughout, pursued the pace from between opponent beginning from the five-eighths marker, was stacked four wide
during the run the around the bend, came under stronger handling coming up to the three-sixteenths marker, was beaten to the lead by the eventual winner,
stayed on for second. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY pinched at the start, headed for the rail afterwards, getting there by the top of the backstretch, contently
brought up the back of the pack, tipped into the two path at the three-sixteenths pole, rallied for the show. SISTER PATRICIA put into the two path,
contended for the top from between rivals for over a half, had already taken over by a narrow lead turning into the stretch, came under a ride a sixteenth
later, desperately clutched to a narrow lead, yielded leaving the eighth pole and weakened. LOVELY LADY LEXI remained stationed along the inside route,
showed the way, hounded by heavy outside pressure, gave in to it late on the bend, got set down cutting the corner into the lane, stayed prominently placed
for a little while longer then faltered. DIRTY BIRD strung out on the overland route on the turn, folded.

Footnotes
RYAN'S CAT four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, advanced from the seven-sixteenths to stack outside the top trio three furlongs from home, took
over narrow command inside the five-sixteenths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. CLENCH five paths off
the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing behind a wall of rivals at the three-eighths, angled five wide into
upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. ZAEVION coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace three wide
outside a pair coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages while safely
preserving the show honors. FAMILY BIZ bumped at the start by THE GREAT DANSKY due to pressure from LATIN LOVE BUG breaking inwards to that
rival's outside, chased three then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish.
LATIN LOVE BUG broke in at the start bumping THE GREAT DANSKY into FAMILY BIZ, chased two to three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn,
swung four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. TWELFTH LABOUR prompted the pace from the two path between foes, got set down spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. THE GREAT DANSKY got bumped at the start by LATIN LOVE BUG and in turn bumped FAMILY BIZ,
chased three then two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went three wide for home and tired. REJECTED AGAIN bobbled at the break getting
away near the rear of the field and came under hustling advancing to take command five and a half furlongs from home, showed the way in hand under
pressure from a pair and then a trio when joined by the eventual winner on the turn, yielded the front just inside the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and folded.

CONTROL GROUP away in good order, attained a prominent position, stalked MALIBU PRO within striking distance from path two, got asked for more
springing from the five-sixteenths marker, hitched up to the one to catch shortly afterwards, chipped away at the deficit with good determination, wore down
the second place finisher well inside the sixteenth pole and edged clear. MALIBU PRO established the top on the chute, got guided onto the inside route,
rated kindly carving out the pace, with the winner keeping watch from the outside, inched away from the competition to lead by his largest margin as
three-quarters was being completed, settled in upper stretch and saw the pilot to to work, clung tenaciously to an ever-dwindling advantage, relinquished for
good in the final seventy yards, had plenty left to salvage second. DARK STORM at a considerable distance from off the inside throughout, chased the pace
four wide n the turn, fanned out out towards path five for the stretch run, finished well enough to be along for the show. SUPREME AURA held in reserve
tracking the pacesetter from the pocket, was let out a notch at the five-sixteenths pole and still more cutting the corner into the lane, got outkicked.
COLONEL JUAN took up position in midpack, travelled in the three path on the bend, got turned loose at the five-sixteenths pole, went into the stretch and
came up empty. DURKIN'S CALL saved ground to no avail. CHIEF KNOW IT ALL forwardly placed three wide, gave way after going six furlongs.

MIA BELLA ROSSA four then three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, angled five to six wide into upper stretch,
rallied to take command a furlong out and edged away under a drive kept to task. DARIA'S ANGEL four then three wide in aim of the leader, advanced to
take over command just inside the five-sixteenths, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, ran
on to secure the place honors. FLAT AWESOME JENNY broke in at the start bumping HAPPYCREST into FIRST DAWN and pinching those rivals back
against pressure inside from VIOLENT TRICK breaking outwards, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for
home and improved position to garner the show honors. EXCESS CAPACITY forwardly placed three wide from the start, advanced to take command six
and a half furlongs out showing the way down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under increasing pressure to the outside, got headed
for the front inside the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. MISS MI MI chased four then three wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. VIOLENT TRICK broke out at the start bumping FIRST DAWN into
HAPPYCREST and pinching those pair of rivals back against pressure outside from FLAT AWESOME JENNY, who broke inwards, chased along the inside
coaxed along from midway on the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. SIRENIC showed the way early on five paths off the inside,
conceded the front to his barn and stable mate six and a half furlongs from home and chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went
six wide into upper stretch and tired. FIRST DAWN got bumped and pinched back between foes at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and made no impact. HAPPYCREST got bumped between foes and pinched back at the start,

Footnotes
AIR ATTACK got worked into the three path proceeding along the homestretch, vied as the widest of three all the way to the seven-sixteenths pole, flashed
interest hitching up to MUSICAL HEART a furlong down the road, challenged in earnest as the twosome stepped onto the head of the stretch, igniting a
spirited tussle that would last all the way to the wire, struck the front traversing through the furlong grounds, then dug in well to fend off a stubborn foe to
preserve the decision. MUSICAL HEART was getting out slightly racing keenly as the field made its way towards the finish line for the initial time, got
checked and shortly afterwards went about in a more professional manner, cut over to the inside at the crown of the clubhouse turn, set the splits, attended
by a pair of foes positioned in paths two and three themselves, saw the middle member, that being SEVEN LILIES drop back out of the pace contest leaving
the half mile pole, came under aim from the winner an eighth later, was put to a drive a few jumps shy of the quarter pole, offered resistance before
releasing the lead, fought on with good courage but had to settle for the place. SHOOGER RAY TOO underwent a two wide pursuit after making some
contact with EHKTIBAAR in the shadow of the starting gate, kept watch towards the back of the pack, fanned out into the six path from upper to midlane,
becoming the widest of all, had good, but belated energy rallying for the show. DOUBLY BLESSED rated in the pocket until the five-sixteenths pole, tipped
into the two path for entrance into the lane, made no headway. SUPER DUDE forced the issue from path two in between rivals until the seven-sixteenths
pole, before backing away steadily thereafter. VILLAINOUS rode the rail to the end of the second bend, angled five wide into the stretch, made no impact.
HEIRLOOM KITTEN towards the inside in the early going, travelled two wide on the far turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, gave way.
EKHTIBAAR bumped with SHOOGER RAY TOO as the field was sent off and running, made his way into the two path on the backstretch, was back into
path three entering the stretch, lacked a response. AMERICAN LINCOLN strung out three wide on the first turn, got guided over to the rail by the
subsequent one, went into the lane under his own power and was allowed to fade away.
