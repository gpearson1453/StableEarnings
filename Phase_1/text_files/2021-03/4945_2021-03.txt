BETTERTON hard to load, prevailed. BOMBAY SHAKER dueled, outnodded. FIERY PASSAGE dueled, outfinished. RARE B dueled, gamely.
DESVELADO even effort. FIRST PRIZE DYNASTY broke out, no factor. A DIRTY DASH no menace. SLP PAINT MY WAGON off slow, drifted out. DUST
ON A CARTEL stumbled, steadied. REBELDE off slow.
