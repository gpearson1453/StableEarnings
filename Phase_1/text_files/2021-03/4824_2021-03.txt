out on the turn then closed well too late just missing. J WASS chased close up between foes, moved inside on the turn but flattened out. BUCKS ARE
MOVING was urged to the front inside for half a mile and faltered. REBEL TRAVELLER dropped back inside, faded on the turn and was no factor. FOX IN
THE FOG saved ground just behind the leader and gave way after three furlongs.

and lacked a rally. PRINCESS PALOMAR stalked the leaders, chased three wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. YES MZ ADAH vied between rivals
early, then stalked two wide, chased and tired. CANOOCHEE ducked in at the break and was off slowly, then outrun inside.

CALL FITZROY settled off the pace, tracked inside, bid three wide nearing the quarter pole, took over in the stretch and drew clear under urging. OUR
UNCLE DREW vied two wide for the lead, dueled into the far turn, dug in gamely in upper stretch, yielded and then held on late for second. LT. COLUMBO
raced two wide off the pace, moved up on the far turn, rallied outside, gained late and just missed for second. INSPIRED OPTIONS was in tight on the rail
and steadied entering the first turn, then vied inside for the lead, dueled on the far turn and weakened. TRUSTED REDEMPTION was reluctant to load,
raced off the pace inside and did not factor. FACTUM LOVE STYLE stalked outside and faded. SLAM BANG was off a bit slow and outrun.

inside then weakened slightly nearing the finish in a game try. HIGH FLYING GUY split rivals advancing on the turn then flattened out late. RUNS FOR

offered a mild bid. BANKER'S ISLAND saved ground close up to the stretch and faltered. LUNAR ROVER was urged just off the leaders inside and gave
way readily. DRAXHALL WOODS chased wide off the pace and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
ECLIPSED MOON raced off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn, angled out at the quarter pole, swung wide, rallied steadily outside and wore down
his rival in deep stretch to prevail. STARINTHEMAKING pressed the pace from the outside, bid entering the turn, dueled, gained a short lead, dug in gamely
inside of the winner and yielded grudgingly late. WORTH HIS SALT set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn, dug in gamely, then weakened in the
final furlong. KLAATU tracked on the inside, chased between rivals on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and got the nod for fourth. ZITMAN was off a bit
slow, raced off the pace inside, went four wide on the far turn and closed belatedly outside. KID MAC COOL raced two wide off the pace, moved up three
wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. NOBLE KENT raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. THREATLOVESMIDNITE raced three wide early,
stalked outside and gave way.
