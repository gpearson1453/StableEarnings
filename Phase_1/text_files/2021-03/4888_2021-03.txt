Footnotes
STORM RISK broke sharply to the lead drawing off on the turn holding rivals safe through the lane in impressive fashion. ADHHAR stalked the pace as the
leader moved away on the turn, gained some to threaten outside of foe down the lane proving no match late. CAZMAN slow early saved ground into upper
stretch gaining then holding position along the rail. SACCO AND VANZETTI chased early then dropped off some on the turn racing evenly there then
through the lane holding the others in the four paht. CIGAR BOX chased early then weakened on the turn. TOWN DANCER chased on the outside fading
near mid track down the lane. FAST FAIRY played no factor. SCIENCE TO WIN was never involved. BREVET OFFICER was always a step slow.
SUCCESSFUL ROMAN showed little.

Footnotes
DENIRO'SRUNFORFUN hustled up inside pressured through the turn shaking clear in upper stretch winning as much the best. MYSTIC MAGIC sent hard
pressed to draw even three deep on the turn, no match for the winner down the lane would duel abreast foe for place as the pair exchanged bumps winning
out in the end. PERFECT ILLUSION away alertly pressed the pace dueling between horses on the turn, would battle for place while in close bumping in mid
stretch ceding to rival late. WELLOILEDCAT slow early played no factor. ZVOLUME was never involved. AFLAXENDREAM was always outrun. THE
STWARDS REVIEWED THE STRETCH RUN AND TOOK NO ACTION.

MAKING ME CRAZY raced mid pack saving ground to upper stretch swinging off the rail in mid stretch surging in the six path getting up in the last yards.
SEVENTY EIGHT pressed in bid three deep on the turn extending into upper stretch ceding late to wide pressure. KULP a step slow through the turn raced
inside to upper stretch responding to finish well in the two path. AINTGOTTACLUE went evenly off a trio on lead through the turn circling out into upper
stretch threatening late seven wide. FROSTED WHITE FACE broke to the lead pressing between horses on the turn into upper stretch continuing to
respond until late coming up a bit short. ONLY ONE WAY BACK pressed on the inside on the turn wresting a narrow lead in upper stretch weakening late.
EPIMYTHIUM played no factor. UNCLEJACKOMO was never involved. GRANDER PLAN hustled along pursued through the turn wearing out in upper
stretch. ROYAL DRAGOON was always a step slow. NAMATH was always outrun. LANDON'S MIRACLE dropped back early trailing throughout.
