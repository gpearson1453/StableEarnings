Footnotes
GIZMO'S DESTINY was unhurried early, advanced the two path around the final turn, took over from the outside after a mile and was clear late. PLATINUM
AFFAIR took command at once, began to draw off in the two path entering the far turn, bore out under left hand whip in the drive and gave way. STRAW
HAT made a run along the rail around the final turn, angled out for the drive but lacked the needed closing. LADYOFDRAGONSTONE broke in the air, was
caught five wide around the first turn and was finished after five furlongs. JUDGEMENT FREE pressed the early leader in the three path, stopped and was
eased up late. MISS AL DILA was four wide between rivals around the first turn and was eased up late while no factor. MISS FORESTER stopped inside
and was eased up.

YES IT'S ROO settled between horses, rallied three wide around the turn, vied outside into the final furlong and drew clear late. GRAB THE GOLD showed
speed outside, took over early on the turn, edged clear before a half then gave way late. HARD BELLE wasn't far back two wide between horses to the
stretch but lacked the needed closing. OLD FAITHFUL broke sharply to make the early pace along the rail and was finished after a half. JEBOLOGIST went
in the air at the break, left far behind the field, stayed inside and made up ground too late. ANNAMATED MOON advanced outside early then tired.

GAVIE was unhurried after a slow break, rallied the rail around the turn, reached the front entering the final sixteenth then drove clear. IRON WILMA chased
the early leader while out from the inside, swung wide into the stretch and couldn't keep up with the winner. EMPRESS NEFERTITI raced the three path
around the turn, came wide into the stretch and lacked the needed closing. SECRETIVE REVENGE sped to a clear lead soon after the break, ran out
entering the stretch and tired. SPARKLES N GLITTER was never close to the action.

WILDCAT CURA did not break sharply, moved quickly along the inside, stayed along the rail into the stretch, took over after five furlongs and drew out
under brisk urging. SCOOP THE CASH showed speed from the outset, was bumped midway on the backstretch, ran out on the turn and faltered. UNCLE
MANNY was slow early, stayed inside into the stretch, angled between horses, bumped ALL TACKED UP in midstretch and continued evenly. ALL TACKED
UP was slow early, raced three wide around the turn, was bumped in midstretch and continued evenly. LIFE MASTER JIM came in, bumped SCOOP THE
CASH while pressing outside that one midway on the backstretch, was carried wide on the turn and tired. PHIL THE BANKER wasn't far back to the stretch
then stopped. BUSCH LATTE broke slowly, came well out into the track soon after and never caught up.
