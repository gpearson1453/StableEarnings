Footnotes
STUNNING PRINCESS prompted the pace outside CARAMEL SWIRL for six furlongs, challenged in the three-path outside that one and NEVISIAN
SUNRISE turning for home, and proved best after a late duel with the latter. NEVISIAN SUNRISE sat in the pocket tracking behind the leaders, tipped to the
two-path with a bid between horses at the top of the lane, dueled inside STUNNING PRINCESS through deep stretch and came up second best. CARAMEL
SWIRL broke alertly and cut an even early pace inside, picked up the tempo feeling pressure after six furlongs, yielded to challengers through the furlong
grounds and was able to save the show. LAYNLOMAKNDOUGH underwent a three-wide trip, and just missed the show outside CARAMEL SWIRL with a
mild closing response. WOLFBANE bumped with LOOK WHAT I FOUND at the start, raced well back for six furlongs, moved out approaching the stretch
and improved without threatening. FAMILY FRIEND was strung out four wide on the first turn, stayed in range moving in just a bit to the far turn, but faded in
the stretch. BRINA saved ground early, and never reached contention. DALIDA tired after six furlongs. SCARLETT LACE raced three wide to the far turn,
and faded steadily through the lane. KYLEE ROSE was finished early inside. BELLE ELLE was outrun throughout. LOOK WHAT I FOUND bumped with
WOLFBANE and stumbled sharply at the start, and was always far back.

Footnotes
OURNATIONONPARADE was hustled along early to stay close, moved out three wide with aim at KRSTO SKYE leaving the turn, kept to task determinedly
and forged past from outside in the last 70 yards. KRSTO SKYE pressed POSITIVELY AWESOME from outside early, met little resistance taking over and
kicking away after a sharp half-mile, dug in when challenged by the winner through the lane and stayed on stubbornly. WHERE PARADISE LAY was
outsprinted for a half, moved out for the drive and offered a mild response. CREED broke slow and lagged far back early, began to find stride leaving the
turn, finished well on the far outside and galloped out strongly. RUNNING FOR RIZ was taken outside soon after the start, raced three to four wide around
the turn, and could not make an impact. POSITIVELY AWESOME broke through the gate prior to the start, set the early pace hounded by KRSTO SKYE,
could not fend that one off midway on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
FINAL BELLE settled off the early pace two wide, angled four wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole, closed steadily outside under left-handed urging and
was up in deep stretch. COPACETIC prompted the pace two wide, led between foes nearing the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch, finished willingly but
was unable to hold off the winner in the later yards. THIRD DRAFT lacked speed while saving ground, went two wide around the far turn and rallied between
foes to gain the show. CREATIVE CAIRO steadied crossing the wire the first turn, raced off the pace two wide and had a mild rally. TRAFFIC SONG
steadied early, steadied again rounding the first turn, saved ground for five furlongs, angled three wide early on the far turn and was one-paced in the lane.
FUCHSIA stalked the pace three wide, reached even terms near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. MULSANNE (IRE)
saved ground well back, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. BLUE TWIRLIN set the pace along the rail and tired in the lane.
MADEIRA WINE played no factor while racing two wide early and four wide rounding the far turn. PURE FASHION (GB) chased the pace inside and came
up empty in the lane. JUST OK IS NOT OK was outrun inside. RAINBOW BELLE was outrun three wide.

LAVI edged closer to SUBSIDIARY two wide between horses approaching the quarter-pole, challenged from outside into the stretch, and proved best
through a long drive. SUBSIDIARY vied early inside WITCH HUNTER and DANA GRACE, shook off those two after six furlongs, fought back when
confronted by LAVI turning for home, and was bested through the late stages. BETTYB raced two wide outsprinted early, moved inside for the drive and
was along for the show while no threat to the top two. YES FACTOR raced close up inside for six furlongs, and tired. WITCH HUNTER vied outside
SUBSIDIARY early, and weakened in the three-path approaching the stretch. DANA GRACE pressed the pace three then four wide, and began to fade
nearing the stretch. FANTASTIC KINGDOM dropped far back leaving the turn, was pulled up in mid stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
MONTAUK SUMMER hugged the rail in range, waited for room in upper stretch, angled three wide near the eighth pole, closed between rivals under strong
hand urging and was up on the wire. PLEASECALLMEBACK saved ground in midpack, moved up between rivals rounding the far turn, angled three wide
turning for home, took the lead near the eighth pole, quickly put away the pace rivals and led until the final stride. STRONG HEADED was bumped at the
start, raced off the pace two wide, saved ground around the far turn, swung four wide in upper stretch, rallied outside but was outkicked. MONY stalked the
pace two wide, bid between foes in upper stretch but was outfinished from there. FLY FLY AWAY set the pace along the rail to midstretch and gave way.
EMOJI GUY bumped with STRONG HEADED at the start, saved ground off the pace, swung out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. SEIZE THE
HAY lacked speed while saving ground early, went five wide around the far turn and never threatened. SIR HOSKI hit the starting gate, raced off the pace
two wide around the first turn, made some progress four wide around the far turn but faded in the lane. THENORTHREMEMBERS hopped at the start,
raced two and three wide and made little impact. ROAD TO PEACE chased the pace two and three wide, bobbled while tiring nearing the quarter pole and
retreated through the lane. STRIKE THE TOP played no factor while racing three wide.

EASY STRIDE crossed over with the lead after the start, vied inside BEYOND THE CALL and FEELING DANGEROUS for six furlongs, moved clear
through upper stretch, drifted out and had just enough to hold off FARM STRONG in the final yards. FARM STRONG eyed the battling trio entering the far
turn in the two-path, shifted out with aim outside EASY STRIDE into the stretch, gained gradually but could not get past. BEYOND THE CALL pressed the
pace between horses for six furlongs, could not go with EASY STRIDE into the stretch, but stayed on willingly for the show. FEELING DANGEROUS broke
slowly, went up to press the pace three wide, and gave way after six furlongs. LIL JOJO came in shortly after the start and got clipped behind by FLORIDA
LION, and turned in an even effort without threatening. LIQUID LOUIE was always outrun. GRAN PATRON brushed with FLORIDA LION soon after the
start, and was never prominent. FLORIDA LION brushed with GRAN PATRON, clipped heels and stumbled behind LIL JOJO soon after the start, got pulled
up after six furlongs, and walked off.

Footnotes
WILLY BOI contested the early pace between WARRIOR'S PRIDE and RODERICK, poked a head in front coming to the quarter-pole, edged away in upper
stretch, drifted out from left-hand pressure past the eighth-pole and again late, and remained clear. ULTIMATE BADGER trailed into the turn near the
two-path, gradually shifted out to be five wide at the top of the stretch, and finished with good energy on the far outside. LAUDA SPEED bumped with REAL
TALK at the start, raced off the leading trio three then four wide for a half-mile, and rallied mildly. REAL TALK bumped with LAUDA SPEED at the start,
followed behind WILLY BOI in the two-path coming off the turn, shifted out a bit further with aim through the furlong grounds, but did not have enough.
WARRIOR'S PRIDE rushed up inside after breaking a bit slowly, vied inside WILLY BOI and RODERICK for a half, and faded through the final furlong.
RODERICK was widest of a threesome battling up front for a half, and gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
A BIT OF BOTH raced well back three wide, came five wide into the lane, closed strongly outside and was up in the final strides. MISS AURAMET stalked
the pace from the rail, took the lead inside of foes turning for home, put away the pace rivals in midstretch and led until deep stretch. TRACY ANN'S
LEGACY pressed the pace three wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole but was outfinished in the lane. CHOOSE JOY settled off the pace while
racing two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. NIGHTLIFE trailed in the three path early, angled out in upper stretch and
rallied belatedly. COMPENSATE chased the pace four wide and was one-paced in the lane. QUEEN OF SHADES set the pace in the two path and stopped
nearing the lane.

FARSIGHTED broke alertly and vied early outside BOSTON POST ROAD in the three-path, disposed of that rival once roused past the three-sixteenths,
and widened under pressure while drifting out. SHOP GIRL was in range outside early, lost some ground to the leaders moving four then five wide around
the turn, and rallied with good courage on the far outside to get up for second. FEELING MISCHIEF angled to the inside trailing into the turn, put in a run
along the rail to loom a threat in upper stretch, but flattened out late. SHEA D SUMMER bumped with NO MO' SPENDING at the start, pursued the leaders
while moving out four wide approaching the stretch, rallied into second through the furlong grounds, but was outfinished from there. BOSTON POST ROAD
rushed up after the start to duel inside FARSIGHTED from the two-path, could not match strides after a half-mile and gave way. COACH JER'S JOY
bumped with NO MO' SPENDING at the start, raced two to three wide around the turn, and made no headway. SWEET BABY RAELYNN showed speed
inside to the end of the turn, and tired. NO MO' SPENDING got jostled around between SHEA D SUMMER and COACH JER'S JOY at the break, and
retired early. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL raced wide and dropped far back before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
TRAPPEZOID stalked the pace two and three wide, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole, quickly drew off in hand and held well clear while kept in
hand. MYSTICAL MOON was in range three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was clearly second best. ZONIC raced well back in about the
three path, came six wide into the lane and was along for the show. MOZO BELLO chased the pace five wide and lacked a closing bid. CHARLIE THE
GREEK failed to menace while racing five wide. DONJI prompted the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. AREYOUTALKINGTOME played no
factor while racing two wide. POWERFUL ALLY dueled inside for a half and retreated. SO LONG CHUCK dueled two wide and stopped in the lane.
LAUDERDALE was outrun inside. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, SEVEN-FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.
