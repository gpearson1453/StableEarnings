Footnotes
SECRET CLUB raced in a bit tight and steadied from inside entering the first turn, settled into a good position after, remained inside then angled out at the
three-sixteenths pole, rallied outside the top pair under hand urging and won going away. BEAUDACIOUS traveled two wide then moved to the rail around
the first turn, stalked inside and cut the corner exiting the far turn, switched outside the leader in upper stretch and got up for second. IN VRONSKY STYLE
set the pace from inside, inched away nearing the quarter pole, led to deep stretch and yielded late. LUCK IS GOLDEN forwardly placed outside a rival,
came two wide into the stretch and lacked late response. BY MOONLIGHT tracked the pacesetter outside a rival then two wide around the far turn and
weakened. MASTER DIAMOND leaned back and came away slow, fell back early and never got involved.

Footnotes
BRISTOL BAYOU stalked outside the leader up the backstretch, bid alongside LA V. at the quarter pole, led into the drive then put that rival away in upper
stretch and drew off. LA V. sped clear and crossed over to the inside, challenged by the winner at the quarter pole, offered little resistance, chased
BRISTOL BAYOU through the final furlong and finished a clear second. BIG PASSION chased the lone leader from inside then two wide into the stretch and
held the show. BACKTOFLASH was fractious in the gate, lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, lacked a rally but filled out the superfecta.
COSMIC COWGIRL reared in the gate, stumbled at the start, went two wide into the turn then three wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
DU JOUR forced in at the start by HUBRISH, sped to the front and set the pace inside of that same rival, challenged at the quarter pole and responded by
turning that foe away at the top of the lane and drew away. HUBRIS broke in, pressed the pace from outside, headed the leader at the quarter pole, could
not sustain the bid into the drive and shifted in near the three-sixteenths, then chased the winner to the wire while clearly second best. LOST IN SPACE
(IRE) stalked outside a rival or two wide, tipped out into the three path leaving the far turn and weakened. STYLEDOME (IRE) chased from inside through
the both turns and also weakened.

MUSICAL GEM chased outside a pair of rivals early, bid outside BRAVESTONE on the turn and dueled to the stretch, kicked clear of rival and edged away
under a drive. CARELESS KITTEN chased inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch then along the rail into the turn, came off the rail and exited turn two to
three wide, finished willingly and whittle the gap late. COASTAL KING checked off heels early, settled inside and saved ground to the stretch, produced a
mild rally gained the show. THE ROAN RANGER chased the leader between rivals then outside a rival into the turn, came three to four wide into the stretch
and kept on to earn a minor award. BRAVESTONE showed speed along the inside to set the pace, met bid and dueled around the turn, lost contact in upper
stretch, switched off the rail with a furlong to go and weakened. CALL NINE ONE ONE chased behind the pace early then lost ground up the backstretch,
traveled three then two wide on the turn and failed to menace. TROJAN CLUBHOUSE was off slow to begin and dropped back early, moved to the inside
and saved ground through the turn and was never a factor. TODAY MATTERS sat off the pace off the inside, went four wide through the turn and came up
empty.

Footnotes
OX BRIDGE away quickly to establish the front, crossed over to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch and held gamely under right-handed urging. HOLY
EMPEROR tracked between rivals then two to three wide on the far turn, angled out in the stretch, rallied while drifting in a bit late and held second on the
line. COMMANDING CHIEF chased two wide off the pace, angled into the three path around the far turn, came out in upper stretch, rallied while drifting in a
bit late and missed the place. GOT CURLY stalked from inside, saved ground to the stretch and finished evenly to round out the superfecta. MONGOLIAN
KINGDOM stalked outside a rival and came two wide into the drive, steered out in upper stretch, chased within range but could not find more late. MOUNT
PELLIAR was closest in pursuit early in the two path, took aim two wide into the stretch but flattened deep stretch. LABOR UNION stumbled badly at the
start, raced at or near the back of the pack outside a rival, steadied off heels at the seven-sixteenths, angled to the rail past the quarter pole, tipped out in
the stretch and improved position. MY INDY tracked outside a pair of rivals then came four wide into the stretch and never made an impact. PRINCE
MAGICIAN traveled along the inside in mid-pack, lost ground around the far turn and weakened. UNCLE RAY raced three wide early then settled outside a
rival, went three then two wide around the far turn and could not rally. COMPELLUS fractious in the gate, came away a bit slow from inside, traveled near
the back of the pack, swung out entering the stretch, drifted out in the lane and never got involved.

Footnotes
MAGIC ON TAP bobbled at the break, stalked the leader from inside to the stretch, gained a clear path, rallied up the fence and drew clear late. TWO
THIRTY FIVE stumbled a bit leaving the gate, went four wide into the first turn then stalked outside rivals, bid three deep a quarter mile out, struck the front
briefly nearing the sixteenth pole and got outkicked by the winner. PALACE COUP took control early, set the pace from inside, pressured at the
seven-sixteenths pole, challenged by a pair of rivals around the far turn, cleared again into the lane, held a narrow lead at the eighth pole and yielded in the
final sixteenth. ADARE traveled two wide around the first turn, raced in range off the inside, exited far turn three wide and finished evenly late. POTANTICO
traveled near the back of the pack, came five wide into the stretch and kept on to improved position. OFFSHORE AFFAIR up close early, pressed from
outside at the seven-sixteenths, bid between runners a quarter mile out, lost contact into the stretch and weakened. MULBERRY STREET raced off the rail
in mid-pack, entered the stretch four wide and weakened. GO DADDY GO angled in on the first turn, raced along the inside then moved out on the
backstretch, came out on the far turn and entered the stretch five wide but lacked further response. MONGOLIAN LEGEND unhurried in the early going,
traveled along the inside then two wide into the stretch, altered out when rival drifted in late and proved no menace.

Footnotes
JIBBER JABBER (IRE) went three wide into the first turn, stalked outside a rival then off the rail, entered the stretch two wide, rallied between foes and was
crowded near the eighth pole, inched ahead nearing the sixteenth pole and held over the runner-up. VELVET threw his head and came away to a slow
beginning, was unhurried and moved to the inside, angled out on the second turn, split foes with a furlong to go, closed fast but was too late. RHYTHM AND
GRACE up close early outside the leader, bid three wide into the drive, took over in upper stretch, lugged in nearing the eighth pole and got outkicked by the
top pair. WHISTLER'S STYLE stumbled a bit leaving the gate, traveled in mid-pack on the inside, exited far turn two wide and showed a mild response to
earn a minor award. DAMN THE TORPEDOES sped to the front and crossed over to the inside around the first turn, showed the way along the inside to the
stretch, was overtaken in upper stretch, put in tight quarters and steadied near the eighth pole and weakened. HYLAND HAVEN broke out leaving the gate,
settled outside a rival, went three deep into the far turn, four wide leaving that bend and failed to rally. MONGOLIAN MISSION chased off the rail or outside
a rival, entered the lane three wide and flattened out. RAGGED ROSE tracked the pace from inside to the stretch and weakened. FOR THE GOOD TIMES
off slow from inside, dropped back early, came out into the stretch and never made an impact. QUICK TIME (GB) was off slow and broke inward, tucked
inside early, saved ground to the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
AX MAN cleared early and crossed over to the inside, set a pressured pace up the backstretch, moved into the two path nearing the far turn, shook free
approaching the quarter pole and widened under right-handed urging. RESTRAINEDVENGENCE settled off the inside, raced outside a pair of rivals up the
backstretch, four deep on the far turn, entered the stretch four to five wide and bested the rest. FASHIONABLY FAST in range early off the inside, exited the
far turn three to four wide and held the show. MASTERING broke out and bumped MAJOR CABBIE leaving the gate, chased on the inside to the stretch
and never produced a bid. GROWTH ENGINE chased between rivals or two wide, lacked room in upper stretch then altered out with a furlong to go and
could not rally. MAJOR CABBIE got bumped by MASTERING at the start, chased the pacesetter around the first turn then moved up to apply pressure, lost
contact past the five-sixteenths, chased two to three wide into the stretch and faded.
