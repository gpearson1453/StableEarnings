Footnotes
LAVENDER (IRE) steered to the inside on the backstretch, saved ground around the bend, rallied along the fence, took over mid-stretch and kicked clear
under right-handed urging. TROUVILLE came away last in a clean beginning, tracked off the rail then outside a rival, angled four wide around the turn, five
wide in upper stretch, rallied and got up for second. GALLOVIE (GB) chased from inside into the turn, came out on the bend and entered the stretch three
wide, bid four wide and got edged for the place. COVER VERSION angled to the rail, swung five wide leaving the turn, raced seven wide in upper stretch
and produced a mild rally. QUEEN OF THE TRACK away quickly to take control set the pace outside a rival then inched away into the turn, remained clear
to the eighth pole then weakened late. SABURAI lacked early speed and settled off the rail, angled in on the turn and was a bit off the rail into the stretch,
steered out in the drive and never threatened. CAPITAL HEAT up close early inside the pacesetter, chased foe into the turn then angled outside that rival on
the bend, had aim on the leader approaching the eighth pole but flattened between late.

Footnotes
PAWNEE set the pace with VAROMA to the outside, cleared rival past the seven-sixteenths, inched away around the turn then drew off under strong
handling. MAMA SUPERIOR went four wide around the first turn, went up outside the top pair on the backstretch, chased three to four wide around the
second bend and bested the rest. VAROMA pressed the pace from outside, chased the winner into the far turn, entered the stretch three wide and lost the
place. BIG MAMA SUE settled at the back of the field, traveled off the inside then came out on the final turn and entered the lane five wide, asked in the
drive but lacked the needed rally. WARREN'S MEMORABLE chased two wide to the stretch and also failed to rally. MALIBU HANNAH stumbled at the start,
steadied briefly at the three-quarter pole, continued to stalk the pace from inside and remained there to the stretch then faded out of contention.

GIDGETTA stalked the top pair early, raced a bit off the rail through the turn, angled out in the lane, urged once right-handed mid-stretch and reeled in the
leader with a sixteenth to go and drew clear under hand urging. RAKASSAH (IRE) stumbled at the start but recovered quickly, dueled outside of QUIET
SECRETARY for command, shook free at the quarter pole, inched away in upper stretch but could not offer any resistance when challenged by the winner.
NU PI LAMBDA raced off the pace, traveled two to three wide into the lane and finished willingly. ALL QUALITY settled along the fence, tipped out in upper
stretch and could not rally. OVER ATTRACTED trailed the field through the early going, saved ground around the turn, angled out in the stretch and never
threatened. QUIET SECRETARY dueled for the lead from inside into and around the turn, steadied briefly off the heels of RAKASSAH into the stretch and
faded.

BEAUTIFUL GIFT stalked inside then in the two path on the backstretch, moved back inside nearing the far turn, saved ground then came out into the
stretch, surged late and nailed the runner-up on the line. MORAZ chased three wide around the first turn, pressed from outside on the backstretch, took over
past the five-sixteenths pole, fought with KAYLPSO into the lane, put away that rival in upper stretch, inched away then got nailed at the wire. KALYPSO
broke in a bit at the start, sped to the front in the two path then got pressured by MORAZ, lost the lead past the five-sixteenths, fought back from inside to
upper stretch and flattened in the late stages. HEELS UP settled off the pace early while four wide on the first turn, raced in range to the far turn, came four
wide into the stretch, eased in the drive and walked off.

Footnotes
SENSIBLE CAT steadied briefly nearing the finish line for the first time and altered out, went two then three wide around the first turn and chased outside a
rival, gained ground four then three wide on the second bend, struck the front in upper stretch and kicked clear in the furlong grounds. GO GRETA (GB)
bumped leaving the gate, stalked from inside, tipped out on the second turn and headed rival at the quarter pole, took over shortly after and led into the
stretch, lost command nearing the furlong grounds and held the place. MAJESTIC STEPS (IRE) broke out and bumped rival then pulled early, settled into a
stalking position outside a rival, ranged up three wide around the far turn, entered the lane two wide and could not match the top pair in the final furlong.
POLISHED LADY brushed with inner rival at the start, tucked inside and saved ground around the turns, came out into the stretch and improved position.
DERBY QUEST brushed at the start, saved ground throughout and passed tired rivals in the drive. CARPE FORTUNA hopped slightly at the start then
steadied early, chased from inside then moved into the two path around the far turn and weakened. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) pulled early and while
clearing from outside, opened up a comfortable lead and showed the way up the backstretch, started to weaken around the second bend and clung to a
short lead approaching the quarter pole, was overtaken soon after that marker and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
TRAFFIC STOPPER stalked the top trio two wide into the turn, eased out and entered the lane three to four wide, collared the runner-up with a sixteenth to
go and drove past. BIG PASSION vied three deep for command then dueled from quarter pole to the eighth pole, put away inner rival but could not hold off
the winner. WICKS AND CHAPPIES vied for the lead between rivals, dueled with BIG PASSION from the quarter pole to the eighth pole and weakened in
the late stages. PARTYATTHECAPITAL shuffled back between rivals at the start, chased from inside then in the two path exiting the turn and kept on for a
minor award. BINGOS SYSTEM tracked off the inside, went three wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and lacked further response. SUGAR MOON
vied for the lead from inside to the five-sixteenths, started to weaken approaching the quarter pole and retreated in the stretch. QUEEN LARISSA JANE
settled early then closed in four wide leaving the backstretch, moved to the three path around the bend and weakened. SWEET MEG dropped back early,
raced in the two path then angled in on the turn and was never a factor. DIANA PRINCE off a bit slow to begin, lacked early speed, moved to the inside then
came out into the stretch, eased through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
NORTH COUNTY GUY pressed the pace from inside, dueled around the second bend, cleared foe into the stretch and drew away under a hand urging and
geared down nearing the wire. BORDER TOWN steadied between rivals at the three-quarter pole, chased two wide then angled in around the second turn,
rallied up the fence and bested the rest. BROWN STORM (CHI) set the pace under pressure from inside, dueled with that rival into and around the far turn,
lost contact with the winner entering the stretch and kept on to hold the show. MIND THE GAP went two to three wide around both turns and finished with
late effort to earn a minor award. NEXT SHARES raced along the inside while in range, traveled a bit off the rail into the stretch, between foes at the eighth
pole and could not offer the necessary response. RESTRAINEDVENGENCE stalked in the three path then chased four wide in the stretch and lacked a bid.
TIZ PLUS stalked the pace outside a rival, steadied between past the three-eighth pole, lacked room behind rivals in the stretch and was not persevered
with late. MUSAWAAT (GB) traveled mid-pack three wide or outside rivals, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. STIRLING DRIVE stumbled
leaving the gate, angled in and tucked inside on the first turn, remained inside then came out into the stretch, moved out further in the drive and had little
left.

Footnotes
PRAY FOR MY OWNER sped to the front, set the pace with OMG IT'S JESSICA to the outside, cleared that rival in upper stretch and drew off under a
drive. OMG IT'S JESSICA pressed the pace from outside, could not match the winner in the drive and lasted for second. FI FI PHAROAH chased the speed
from inside, angled out on the turn, moved back to the two path into the stretch then came back out, finished willingly and missed the place. SO VERY
SMART chased four deep or five wide early, took the turn four wide, angled in mid-stretch and never rallied. OUR MISS MILLIE sat off the pace, went five
wide into the stretch and never threatened. JEANNE B tracked off the inside then three deep, between foes around the turn, two wide into the drive and
weakened. STRIKING TIGRESS threw head and came away slowly, entered the turn two wide, came four wide into the lane, lugged in upper stretch and
was never a factor. MISS BAYLEE chased outside a rival then between foes early, dropped back around the turn, checked leaving the bend, eased and
steered out in the drive and walked off.

Footnotes
INVINCIBELLA (GB) tracked the speed from inside, tipped out into the stretch, angled out then rallied from outside and got up late. NAVY QUEEN pressed
from outside then moved up to duel for command, chased the leader three wide into the stretch, came back and led briefly late and was edged by the
winner. ACAI chased behind the top pair, saved ground into the stretch, tipped out in upper stretch, bid between mid-stretch and got outkicked. SOPHIE
ANTOINETTE lugged out early crossing surfaces, chased between rivals and was crowded past the half-mile pole, angled five wide into the stretch and
finished with a mild late bid. LADY NOGUEZ broke out and bumped rival lightly at the start, jumped the track crossing surfaces early, trailed the field up the
backstretch, went four to five wide around the turn, steered inward in the stretch then angled back out and finished willingly between late. QUEEN
STORMBORN bobbled a bit at the start, set a pressured pace then dueled with NAVY QUEEN, cleared into the stretch and got caught in the final sixteenth.
GALLANTLYSTREAMING (IRE) forced out by rival crossing surfaces early, chased outside a rival then four wide into the lane, angled in mid-stretch and
flattened. SECRET SQUARE bumped from inside at the start, tracked off the rail then angled in on the turn, steered out in the stretch and never made an
impact. OLE SILVER pulled up the backstretch, chased two then three wide around the turn, angled in upper stretch and lacked a rally.
