Footnotes
SHANANIES PAYNTER was a bit slow at the break after making some contact between WILD CAT WEST and REALTOR DANNY D, advanced steadily
entering the turn while shifting off the inside to the three-path, challenged outside WILD CAT WEST in upper stretch, and edged away through the late
stages. WILD CAT WEST brushed with SHANANIES PAYNTER at the start, stayed close early, took over outside HALO'S DANCE coming to the
quarter-pole, fought back when the winner ranged alongside through mid stretch, and was clearly second best. REALTOR DANNY D bumped lightly with
SHANANIES PAYNTER at the start, stayed in range for six furlongs, came four wide off the turn and finished evenly. HALO'S DANCE set the pace inside,
and faded after being displaced for command. MAGICAL CAUSE raced four to five wide around the turn, and tired in the stretch. BLOKE checked between
horses outside the three-eighths pole, and dropped far back leaving the turn. SKYLINE VIEW had no response to urging entering the turn. REINOANIMAUX
was finished early outside.

Footnotes
MAUREENLOVESFRANK stalked the pace inside, waited for room nearing the lane, angled three wide near the quarter pole, responded to mild urging in
upper stretch, seized command leaving the eighth pole and drew off while ridden out. LIESEL tracked the pace three wide, took the lead in upper stretch,
led past the eighth pole, switched back to the left lead leaving that marker and was clearly second best late. BRODY'S HONOR pressed the pace two wide,
took over near the five-sixteenths pole, angled in entering the lane and weakened. TRASHTHETRAILER settled off the early pace along the inside, angled
out entering the turn, raced three and four wide around the bend and lacked a closing bid. TALK DIRTY set the pace along the rail, was collared near the
five-sixteenths pole, steadied while tiring nearing the three-sixteenths marker and retreated inside. NANCY WORK veered in at the start, chased the pace
four wide around the turn, stopped and was easing through the lane.

Footnotes
THE REIGN MAN tracked outside the early leaders, took over three wide near the five-sixteenths and moved in a path, and widened away from CAPTURED
BY FATE through the last eighth of a mile. CAPTURED BY FATE hustled to the lead after the start, came under fire from two rivals entering the turn, could
not match strides with THE REIGN MAN in upper stretch, drifted out late and saved the place. TOOK A CAB swung four wide approaching the stretch,
finished evenly outside and was up for the show. CAPITAN FOFO had to tap on the brakes behind the leads midway on the turn, came under a ride near
the five-sixteenths, stayed on his left lead in the stretch and was outfinished. STARSHIP TAXI pressed the early pace outside CAPTURED BY FATE, vied
into the turn between the latter and THE REIGN MAN, and shifted out three wide weakening at the top of the lane. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE angled to the
rail early, and was outrun.

TOO MUCH TIP stalked the pace four wide, cruised up to the front near the quarter pole, quickly drew clear, angled in in upper stretch and widened while
ridden out. NIKEE KAN vied two wide between foes to upper stretch, was no match for the winner but stayed on to hold second. REAGAN'S ROSE raced
off the pace three and four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was along for the show. UNAQUOI steadied nearing the half-mile pole, saved
ground off the pace, got through a wide open rail in upper stretch but flattened out late. OVER GATORS had speed three wide between and weakened in
the lane. OUR LITTLE DEVIL set a pressured pace along the rail and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
CHIPSHAPE bumped with SIDARTH at the start, advanced around the turn inside, tried to get through on the rail at the top of the stretch to no avail, angled
to the far outside past the eighth-pole and responded to be along in time on his left lead. SIDARTH was bumped between horses at the start, shifted out four
wide approaching the stretch, rallied to the lead entering the final furlong, but was overhauled near the finish. GREYZER bumped with FITZ'S MO at the
start, tracked the leaders three wide, challenged for command after six furlongs, but weakened through the late stages. JR SPEED bumped with SIDARTH
at the start, set the pace slightly off the rail to upper stretch, and gave way. UNCLE PIP was no factor near the inside. FITZ'S MO bumped with GREYZER
at the start, pressed the pace outside, came under a ride early on the turn, and was empty before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
LIVIN AT THE BEACH settled off the early pace along the inside, lost some ground bottled up between rivals around much of the far turn, swung five wide
near the quarter pole, surged to the front in upper stretch, drifted in under left-handed urging in upper stretch, continued on the left lead to sixteenth pole,
switched over and continued to widened while geared down from there. LETSNOTGETOEXCITED raced two wide in midpack early, made progress four
wide around the far turn, was no match for the winner in upper stretch but stayed on to gain the place. MIRANDA SOFIA raced off the early pace three wide,
made a strong three wide move around the far turn, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, was collared soon after and weakened in the lane. PRINCESS
MERIDA saved ground and failed to menace. NIGHT ORCHID set the early pace along the rail, chased inside down the backstretch and faded around the
far turn. SAINTE MERE EGLISE played no factor while racing two and three wide. MARICOPA steadied after the start, saved ground early, went four and
five wide around the far turn and never threatened. TETRAHYDRO came in and bumped foes at the start, advanced four wide around the first turn, dueled
outside down the backstretch and around the far turn then wilted in the lane. WINNIPEG WONDER advanced three wide around the first turn to take lead
nearing the backstretch, angled in soon after, dueled inside from there to the quarter pole then retreated. MYSTICAL CHARGE was squeezed back at the
start and never involved. CHARDRENEE broke and bumped foes at the start, was hard held in range while racing two wide for six furlongs, stopped and
was eased. TAPIZAR GIRL was pinched back at the start, saved ground and made little impact.

FREE TO FLY became unsettled at the break and came lunging out four lengths behind the field, recovered to a contending position two wide before
reaching the turn, moved out to the four-path cruising up outside the leaders at the top of the stretch, got shaken up mildly as she gained command into the
last eighth of a mile, and drew away in hand. BEAST OF WILDWOOD pressed the early pace outside SALSA RITA, held a short lead from midway on the
turn to the five-sixteenths pole, got collared from outside approaching the stretch by FLASHING DIAMOND, moved to the rail and dug in to prove best in the
battle for second. FLASHING DIAMOND was taken off the inside midway up the backstretch, rallied to the lead three wide just before completing a half-mile,
battled between rivals into the lane, and was outfinished for the runner-up spot. WHIP ME INTO SHAPE raced near the inside at the back early, and tired
through the stretch. SALSA RITA set a pressured early pace inside, was overrun by three pursuers around the turn and folded up.

Footnotes
DANCING DOLL raced well back four wide, swung widest in upper stretch, closed outside under steady left-handed urging, took the lead leaving the
sixteenth pole, switched back to the left lead, straightened out and edged ahead under hand urging. AFFICIONADO (FR) lacked early speed while racing
two wide, angled out in upper stretch and rallied between foes. TONY'S ROSE saved ground well off the pace, got through inside in the lane and rallied for
the show while outkicked by the top two. TRUE HEIRESS settled off the pace while racing three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, bid between
foes in midstretch but was outkicked in the final furlong. SWEETLY MAID raced two wide in midpack, angled out in upper stretch, raced between foes in the
lane and was one-paced. BRIGHT VENEZUELAN saved ground off the pace and was no threat while lacking room through most of the stretch.
FIGHTRESS chased the pace four wide, bid in upper stretch then weakened in the last eighth. SWIRLING CANDY pressed the pace three wide, briefly led
in midstretch and tired. GOT GLEE stalked the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT was outrun outside. DEALER'S GIRL
set the pace in the two path to midstretch and caved.

BIMINI bumped with SHES ALL WOMAN at the start, began closing in on the leaders around the turn, came four wide lodging a bid outside SHES ALL
WOMAN through upper stretch, and drove clear past the furlong marker. SHES ALL WOMAN bumped with BIMINI at the start, advanced outside TIZ
POSSIBLE DEAR after a half-mile, reached a narrow advantage into the stretch, but could not handle the winner late. NACHO MAMA was outsprinted for a
half three then four wide, and rallied on the far outside. TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR dashed clear soon after the start, got overhauled after straightening away for
the drive, and weakened on the rail. BAHAMIAN GIRL pursued the pacesetter toward the inside for a half, came two wide into the lane and faded.
AWESOME ANNMARIE was no factor inside. MY ASHLEIGH broke two lengths behind the next-to-last horse, raced two to three wide around the turn,
moved in through upper stretch and could not gain. MISS MIAMI dropped back to midpack after an alert beginning, and was through early outside.

Footnotes
LONTANO settled off the pace while racing two wide, swung out in upper stretch, closed with a rush and was up in the final strides. SCOTTY BROWN
saved ground off the pace, swung out in upper stretch, closed strongly between rivals and just missed. BIG DRINK OF WATER dueled two wide, drew clear
in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the stretch, drifted out late and led until deep stretch. THE VIRGINIAN broke out and slammed FLATTER
ME at the start, tracked the pace two wide, made progress through the lane, was carried out by BIG DRINK OF WATER late and was outkicked. READY TO
ANSWER raced far back three wide, angled widest in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. ZANNO raced three wide in midpack, shifted further out in upper
stretch, raced between foes in the lane and steadied in deep stretch. KING SNAKE stalked the pace three wide, stayed on between rivals and steadied in
deep stretch. FLATTER ME was slammed at the start, dropped well back outside, shifted wider in upper stretch and finished with some interest.
BLOODPROF failed to menace while racing two wide. LIVING VICARIOUSLY dueled inside to upper stretch and tired. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE RUN THROUGH THE STRETCH BUT FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
MISCHIEFFUL sped clear soon after the start, showed the way inside to the stretch, and held firm under pressure. GOODNIGHT OLIVE chased inside from
the start, moved out to the two-path with aim at the top of the stretch, could not reach the winner and was clearly second best. ALLWORTHY broke slowly
and was outrun early, came five wide off the turn and finished well to go clear for the show. GIVERNY bumped with KAY'S PROJECT at the start, chased
three wide to the stretch, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. FROZAY ALL DAY broke slowly, lagged well back four wide for a half-mile, and
improved past tired horses. VIGILANTIA raced in striking range two to three wide for a half, and tired. HITECH IS BACK settled in midpack two to three
wide, and lacked a response. FLASHY TOO was outrun inside. A HIGHER LOVE chased after the winner early, and was finished on the turn. KAY'S
PROJECT stumbled at the break and recovered bumping into GIVERNY, and was always far back. HOSTILE PRINCESS was done early three wide.
