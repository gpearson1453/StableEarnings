Footnotes
MANHATTAN LEGACY was lightly bumped by CHARLO in the opening strides, stalked the pace outside her, engaged outside her near the five sixteenths,
responded well when driven past the quarter pole and drew off from the three sixteenths. HEART OF REASON was difficult to settle early, raced second
last, chased in the two to three path on the turn while improving position from near the three eighths, swung five wide in upper stretch, kept on mildly under
a drive and got up for place late. CHARLO broke outward and lightly bumped MANHATTAN LEGACY in the opening strides, was placed on the lead, saved
ground through the turn, was confronted by MANHATTAN LEGACY near the five sixteenths, vied inside her under a drive until proving no match near the
three sixteenths, and weakened inside. PERFECT DIVA chased the leading pair early, angled three wide near the half mile mark for a bid, tracked outside
the leading pair around the bend, could not keep pace with them in upper stretch and weakened in the three to four path while under a drive in the lane.
NURSE SADIE settled at the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, swung out and was driven six wide in upper stretch, and lacked the needed
response.

Footnotes
EMPTY HOLSTER led the field while saving ground around the first turn, continued to show the way from the inside up the backstretch, began to distance
himself from the field while still under a hold around the far turn and continued to extend his lead to the wire, winning easily under a hand ride. OFF TO THE
BEACH raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in midpack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and
chased the winner home, the best of the rest. ROCKET RIDE broke slowly, lugging in slightly leaving the gate, recovered to race in the two path around the
turn, moved up on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and finished evenly. BE AN INSPIRATION took up slightly
headed into the first turn, saved ground from there, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the far turn, swung wider still into the
stretch and offered no bid. FELIXNITETRAINCOLE dueled for the lead from the three path around the first turn, raced between horses up the backstretch,
began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
STORMY EMPIRE broke in and bumped I JUANA HERO in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and three wide around the
bend, loomed outside of BOBBIE TOO TOO from upper stretch, took the lead approaching the sixteenth pole and drew clear. BOBBIE TOO TOO was sent
for pace, saved ground around the turn, clung to the lead under a drive in the lane while STORMY EMPIRE loomed to her outside, grudgingly relinquished
the lead approaching the sixteenth pole, and kept on clear for place. SAY CHEESE acted fractious in the gate, was urged to show pace early but
outsprinted to the lead by BOBBIE TOO TOO, encroached outside that foe near the half mile mark, stalked two wide on the turn, was driven approaching
the quarter pole, proved no match for BOBBIE TOO TOO and STORMY EMPIRE into the lane, and chased on for show under a drive. MAGNITUDE TEN
broke out and bumped I JUANA HERO in the opening strides, settled inside of that foe in the rear pair early, chased toward the rear in the two path on the
turn, went to a drive past the quarter pole, but lacked the needed rally. I JUANA HERO was bumped between horses in the opening strides, raced outside of
MAGNITUDE TEN in the rear pair down the backstretch, trailed in the four to five path on the turn, and offered no response under a drive in the lane.

ENZOEXPRESS dueled for the lead on the inside around the backstretch and around the turn, dug in gamely to pull clear with a furlong to go and held off a
late closer to save the win. NYOMAN hopped up and was shut out at the break, trailed the field in the opening stages, began to move up headed into the
turn, launched a bid from the two path approaching the three eighths pole, and gained ground on the outside while drifting out in late stretch. SACRA
HOXEN dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, continued to contest in upper stretch, gave way with a
furlong to go and finished evenly. COUNTRY COOL raced off the pace on the outside early, dropped back to trail the field headed into the turn, navigated
the turn from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and passed tiring horses on the outside. ROAD GAME hit the gate and veered out at the
break, raced off the pace on the inside early, came around the turn in the two path and faded on the rail in the stretch. HIGH HERO pressed the pace on the

Footnotes
HINTON settled three wide in the rear pair, began to improve position past the nine sixteenths, took closer order in the two to three path on the far turn,
sustained his rally two wide in the lane, reeled in the leader at the sixteenth mark and cleared. RUNNINGFROMTHEFEDS soon led, set a quick pace inside
while hounded by ZANFORCE, cleared past the half mile mark, saved ground around the far turn, went to a drive near the three sixteenths, was headed by
HINTON near the sixteenth pole but kept on well enough under urging to save the place. ANGELINO settled at the inside of the rear pair, was pushed along
in the three path on the far turn and improved position, shifted out midstretch, and gained under a drive. CHARLIE IRISH chased well behind the dueling
pair, was pushed along while saving ground on the far turn and driven in upper stretch but offered no response, and was eased in the final furlong.
ZANFORCE stumbled out of the gate, sent to hound the pace outside of RUNNINGFROMTHEFEDS, began to weaken near the half mile mark, faded in the
two path on the far turn, and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
CHAINMAIL raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the
three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, and gained ground on the outside to get up in the final sixteenth of a mile. SERTOMAN raced in the
two path around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, bumped lightly with GO FOR SHERRIE
near the quarter pole, and raced gamely down the lane, getting caught late. PENTIMENTO trailed the field from the two path around the first turn, began to
move up on the outside for the run up the backstretch, launched a bid approaching the half mile pole, came around the far turn in the three path, and dueled
between horses in the final furlong, just falling short. FORT RAMSEY saved ground around the first turn, stalked the frontrunners on the inside up the
backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path, entered the stretch with nowhere to go, finally shifted out to find room and gained ground late, but ran
out of ground. GO FOR SHERRIE raced in the four path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn
in the two path, bumped lightly with SERTOMAN entering the stretch and tired from there.

Footnotes
VALIANT VINNY broke sharply, set the pace while taking pressure early from DEMAND RANSOM to his inside, ran clear in the two path on the turn,
opened up in the lane while under a mild drive, and ran on clear to the wire. BABA LOU chased toward the rear down the backstretch and in the two to three
path on the turn, rallied inside horses into the lane, sustained his rally between horses under a drive in the lane, proved no match for the winner but got up
for place near the sixteenth. JEFF THE LION chased outside of D' YANK down the backstretch, was driven in the six path on the turn, raced three wide into
the lane, kept on with interest under a drive but was outfinished for the place. D' YANK chased inside of JEFF THE LION down the backstretch and in the
five path on the turn, came into the lane between horses, shifted out approaching the furlong mark, and kept on four wide past tiring horses. GIVIN UP
NONE tracked the leading pair down the backstretch, tracked the leader in the four path on the turn while racing outside of DEMAND RANSOM, was driven
two wide into the lane, proved no match for VALIANT VINNY, and weakened inside in the final furlong. MISTER CHARMING settled near the rear down the
backstretch and in the three path on the turn, was urged while taken toward the center of the track in upper stretch, and lacked the needed rally. DEMAND
RANSOM broke slightly awkwardly, was sent inside to press the pace inside of VALIANT VINNY, was wrangled back near the seven sixteenths and tracked
the leader inside of GIVIN UP NONE from there, was driven into the lane, proved no match for the leading pair, and weakened inside. YOUNG CORBETT
settled at the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, and offered no response.

FIRST SQUADRON chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, moved up to challenge the frontrunner
approaching the five sixteenths pole and pulled clear in the final furlong. U. S. CURRENCY led the field on the rail through the opening half mile, was caught
with a furlong to go and finished evenly to hold second. HENRYS GIRL raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn
from the two path, and improved position between horses in late stretch. PROMISES KEPT raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, began a bid
from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, entered the stretch in the three path and made a mild gain of ground on the outside late. STOLEN
GLANCE stumbled and brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the
three path, and came up empty from there. WILDWOOD MAGGIE broke slowly, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the turn and made no bid. DETOUR brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and faded in the stretch. DULCE MARIA chased the leader between horses through the opening quarter
of a mile, saved ground around the turn and tired entering the stretch.
