Footnotes
EARNER broke alertly, set or forced the pace along the inside throughout, gave ground grudgingly to the winner through the lane, well clear of the others.
BUTTERED NOODLES away in good order, with the pace from the start while between horses, narrowly showed the way through the turn in the two path,
held that advantage into the stretch, held the runner up at bay under steady handling. DEFLATER last to leave, raced in the second flight off the inside,
steered three wide exiting the turn, staged a mild rally well out in the strip to be along for the show, no match for the top two. HANSENS MISCHIEF pressed
the issue while three wide, pressed the winner from the outside turning into the stretch, weakened, caught late for the show. APPRAISAL void of speed in
trailing for a half, saved ground, made little impact in lacking a closing kick. PINTXOS in the second ground while out in the strip, weakened in the drive to
trail home.

Footnotes
FRILLS broke alertly, briefly dueled with the other speed off the inside, chased that rival into the turn, rebid late in the bend, floated out a bit into the lane,
shook clear, kept to task. SHAHARAZAD settled off the pace just off the inside, came three wide into the stretch, rallied to be up late for the place. SHOWIT
last away, moved up to become a forward factor before a quarter toward the inside, saved ground into the lane, could not match the winner in the drive,
nipped late for the second spot. BIG TINY void of speed, four wide into the turn, five out to six wide exiting, improved position while remaining well out in the
strip. BACKSEAT PROMISES in mid pack outside, four wide turn, five wide into the lane, picked off some tiring rivals late. SKAMANIA broke through the
start prior to the start, clear before a quarter, dueled turn, weakened in the drive. FRIENDLY AND KIND broke back, made an early advance through much
of the turn inside, tilted out to be in the two path around a tiring rival entering the stretch, flattened out in the drive. MIA PROMESSA back off the pace and
the inside, four wide turning for home, retreated. CAN'T TOUCH ME was never back involved in remaining back.

Footnotes
SUGAR LOVE with the pace from the start outside, vied three wide into the stretch, disposed of the other speed to be clear when straightened for home,
held the next two safe late under steady handling. SUPER WONDER GIRL lacked early foot while racing in the four path, swung out five wide for the stretch
run, finished willingly late to be up for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. RAGGEDY ANNIE behind the first flight well off the inside, three wide
turn, angled out four wide for the drive, lodged a brief and mild bid outside the winner nearing the furlong grounds, flattened out, caught late for the place.
FLASHY BIZ last to leave, trailed for over a half, picked off some tiring rivals while not a serious threat to the top three. WICKED FLASHBACK broke
sharply, narrowly set the pace inside, continued to contest the issue through the turn, faltered turning for home. BLINKERS forwardly place early, moved up
to contest the issue while between horses through the turn, weakened in the drive. PREMIER WISH was finished early.

Footnotes
NIALL off a step slow, raced well back, three wide into the turn, swung five wide into the lane, finished with good late energy while widest in the drive to be
up in time. CHANGE DIRECTION back off the pace and the inside, four wide through the bend, moved out a bit for the drive and also closed well while just
inside the winner, up late for the place while between horses. JACK VAN BERG with the pace outside, vied four wide into and through the turn, continued to
do battle past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end while also between foes at the wire. TAPALIST broke pace, lagged well back in the two path,
moved out to be three wide into the lane, finished willingly through traffic. TIME HEIST with the pace along the inside, narrowly showed the way pace the
furlong grounds while remaining closest to the inside, yielded late. CHURCH OF MANY with the pace while three wide and between rivals for a half, began
to weaken nearing the furlong grounds. CANDY'S LITTLE TIP behind the leaders off the inside, three wide into the stretch, in some traffic late in lacking
clear room. WINGS UP broke slowly, raced well back, three wide through the turn, made little impact. ITS MY BAG BABY broke through the gate prior to the
start, raced three wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. BOO REID saved ground to no avail. WYOMING CONQUEST
with the early while between rivals, gave way in the turn. SYCAMORE RUN broke with the field, shortened stride soon after, was pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
BODE'S MAKER allowed the pace to go early while outside, continued in the four path up the backstretch, ranged up to challenge while remaining in the
four path turning for home, shook clear nearing the furlong marker, held the runner up safe late under firm handling. JUMPER broke in, settled off the pace
and the inside, closer in some traffic late in the final turn, came three out to four wide for the drive, finished willingly late to be getting to the winner late.
SHORTLIST void of speed outside, four wide through the first turn, four out to five wide when moving closer turning for home, flattened out a bit late,
finished up best of the rest. CHARLIE'SARCHANGEL chased the leader off the inside, continued prominently into the stretch then gradually weakened.
CATDADDY settled off the pace toward the inside, continued to race within striking distance 2nd turn, lacked a punch in the stretch. HARD TO BE GOOD
forwardly placed while racing three wide, had little left for the drive. SHWEET PERSUASION sprinted clear to set a quick pace, gave way when headed
turning for home. TAKE CHARGE D'ORO steadied at the start, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
TYLER'S TYRONZA outrun early off the inside, four wide early 9in the bend, came five wide into the stretch, set down for the drive when rallying, assumed
command inside the furlong grounds and edged clear late under steady handling. SPURWINK LANE forwardly placed from the start, challenged and took
over outside the early leader midway on the turn, showed the way into and through upper stretch, gave ground grudgingly to the winner until late. HOT
SPRINGS BLING off slow, raced back off the early pace, asked along and moved slightly closer in some traffic late in the turn, lacked room and was
shuffled back soon after the start, steered out for room entering the stretch and finished willingly to improve position. MOONSHINE PRINCESS broke back,
void of any early foot, continued to trail, four out to five wide through the turn, improved position with some mild late interest. LITTLE BURRITO broke well,
showed the way in the run up the backstretch, dueled briefly along the inside turn then began to gradually weaken through the stretch. ARKANSAS BLING
broke with the field, moved out to race four wide through the turn, came up flat in the drive. LONGNTALL void of speed outside, raced four out to six wide
through the turn, lacked a closing kick. DEE LIKES THIS ONE broke through the gate prior to the start, broke well, fell back, saved ground through the turn
then faded. DO ME A FAVOR prompted the pace while racing off the inside, gave way. DENALI ROCKET in mid pack while racing toward the inside, traffic
late in the turn, failed to muster a rally when clear for the drive. THIS GIRL DOES pressed the issue early off the inside, steadily faded. CHOCTAW
CHARLIE lacked early foot, checked up in tight quarters early in the turn, recovered only to encounter traffic once again late in the turn and through early
stretch to lose all chance.

Footnotes
NAUGHTY ALFRED within striking distance while racing three wide, set down turning for home, finished with good energy to be up in time. TOUGH STUFF
broke well, dueled early off the inside, shook clear midway on the turn, continued to show a clear advantage past the furlong marker, could not contain the
winner, held sway for the place. EXULTING in tight at the start, raced back early, came four wide out of the turn, rallied out in the strip to be getting to the
runner up late. HE'S NO BULL broke on top, dueled inside, could not keep up with the runner up turning for home, weakened steadily to be caught late for
the show. PLEASE THE COURT raced in mid pack outside, came five wide out of the turn, roused, managed little in the way of a late bid to finish up evenly.
DAAHER'S SUCCESS settled in the two path in the second flight, lacked a closing kick as well. WHOLE LOTTA LUCK broke in, slight brush, void of speed,
four wide turn, improved slightly while never a threat. RECOUNT failed to menace while racing outside. BAR STOOL BUDGET was finished early.

Footnotes
BLACKBERRY WINE cleared toward the inside into the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, widened through the second bend, not menaced in the
drive under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. MO MOSA allowed to settle off the pace and the inside, three wide through both turns, roused for the drive,
proved no match for the winner, game for the second spot late. GUN IT pinched back at the start, raced well back most of the way, four wide into the stretch,
late bid from the outside for the place, outfinished for that position, clear of the others. BRUDER BOB within striking distance early inside, continued to save
ground into and through the second turn, finished up evenly in lacked a late punch. LYKAN chased the winner in vain from the two path, weakened in the
drive. DEAN MARTINI broke in, raced back and three wide, was never a threat. SPA CITY settled off the pace toward the inside, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
WILL'S SECRET broke with the tightly bunched field, with the pace in the two path, put a head in front under a snug hold after a quarter, continued to firmly
rate into the far turn, extended that advantage when let out a notch into the lane, held the runner up safe in the late going under firm pressure while outside
that rival. PAULINE'S PEARL took back at the start, moved closer off the inside after a quarter, in some traffic second turn, split foes three sixteenths out,
finished up willingly while closest just before the wire, no gain in the final strides, second best. SUN PATH forwardly placed while outside the winner, crept
closer in hand far turn, pressed that same foe into and through upper stretch, had little for that one late while drifting in slightly. OLIVIAOFTHEDESERT
broke well, within striking distance while racing outside, four wide while still in good position second turn, came up empty when called on in the drive.
COACH lacked early foot while three out to four wide in the first turn, continued to race outside, three wide through the second bend, made little impact
through the stretch. TABOR HALL showed the way past the wire the first time inside, relinquished the advantage to the winner onto the backstretch, rated
when pressing the issue along the middle half, weakened when the real running began turning for home. WILLFUL WOMAN off a step slow and steadied
slightly, settled off the pace inside in the second flight,fell back far turn, moved out three wide, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
OTTOTHELEGEND broke out to be off a step slow, four wide through the first turn, moved closer in traffic into the far turn, continued covered up through
that bend, tipped out a bit for room when straightened for home, set down, finished with good late energy to win going away. CAERUS broke on top,
narrowly set the pace inside, continued with good mettle when showing the way past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late, narrowly held
the place. SAQEEL void of early foot, continued back second turn, came in the two path for the drive, finished full of run to narrowly miss the place.
WINDCRACKER pressed the runner up off the inside, kept up the pressure into and through the final turn, weakened slightly in the drive to be outkicked late
for the second spot between horses. HE'SMYHONEYBADGER evenly paced while racing off the inside, three wide into the stretch, lacked a closing
response for the drive. HANKS off a step slow, four wide into the first turn, continued to race outside, came up empty for the stretch run. RAM settled off the
pace while three wide early, was four wide through the second bend, also failed to muster a rally when called on. CHROME RUN forwardly placed early
while saving ground, steadily faded after a half.
