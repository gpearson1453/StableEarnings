Footnotes
WHISPERING ROSE was settled outside foes racing three deep to the backstretch, shifted in splitting rivals after a half, angled inside entering the far turn
steadily gathering momentum, angled out five wide racing into upper stretch, moved to wrest command nearing the sixteenth marker and kicked away under
some right handed pressure. VOLADOR tracked off the second flight while shifting out racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide
nearing the midway point of the far turn, moved to gain the advantage in that path racing into upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the
winner. RIDGELYSREDHOT, bumped at the start, recovered quickly to gain a forward placing, was rated near the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of
the second flight, briefly awaited an opening racing into the far turn, was fanned six wide while being prompted to advance with the eventual winner racing
into upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick while prevailing for a share. MINEWELLRECEIVED broke inwards bumping a rival, was settled near the
inside, shifted outside rivals on the far turn, was fanned seven wide into upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. HOLIDAY CURLS
tracked the pacesetter outside rivals in second flight, advanced three deep racing into the far turn to lodge a brief bid between foes but flattened out in upper
stretch. ATHENASWAY settled last early and proved no threat. MOMENTS TO SAVER was urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace to the far
turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. COUNTESS JESSICA, urged to gain a forward placing in the opening stages, tracked just off the pacesetter
between foes to the backstretch, advanced to press the issue entering the far turn and emptied out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
NOTHINS FREE broke readily, was urged along the inside disputing the pace through the backstretch, shook clear racing into upper stretch and extended
the advantage late under firm left handed pressure. SOLD ON SALSA was urged to force the pace outside the eventual winner through the backstretch into
the turn, couldn't match that foe in upper stretch but continued with interest to hold a rival for the place honors. LEDECKY was settled off the second flight
while angling inwards nearing the turn, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and finished well enough to earn a share. MI TIA CHRISTINA tracked
off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch but lacked a closing kick. NOBLE INTENTIONS tracked off the first
flight inside rivals racing to the turn but faded early. I'LLMAKEYOUSMILE tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing into the bend, shifted out
four wide nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. ROSALDA was never a factor.

lead a bit off the rail in the opening stages, dueled for command inside a rival to midstretch but proved no match late. HONEY BEEST, urged to a forward

stages. KISSMELIPS swerved inwards just after the start bumping DOSHA, was righted to make pursuit of the leaders between foes racing into the turn but
faded nearing the lane. VOODOOISM, caught five wide off the second flight, raced four wide through the turn to upper stretch and continued evenly.

Footnotes
ROSE'S CAUSE tracked off the first flight outside foes racing through the backstretch, shifted four wide on the turn while being prompted to advance,
moved to challenge the pacesetter in that path nearing midstretch, then went clear under strong handling. GOLDA BISCUIT, urged to dispute the pace a bit
off the rail from the outset, edged forward into upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. THATS ALL SHEWROTE tracked off the
first flight between foes racing into the bend, shifted out four wide in late stages but lacked the needed final kick while prevailing for a share. WHAT A
KNOCKOUT tracked off the second flight three wide racing to the turn and improved position between foes in that path in the closing stages. LADY
PROTONICO, slow into stride, then held up avoiding close quarters in the opening stages, angled outside foes on the backstretch, was fanned six wide
entering the stretch and made no real impression. MARLEE, bumped at the start, was settled along the inside, split rivals just off the inside entering upper
stretch but had no final kick. BILL'S BEAUTY angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn and gave way in upper
stretch. LET'S GO MAYA, bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight racing to the turn, shifted three wide in upper stertch and faded. PASS THE
SALSA dropped out early. BY MY OWN angled to the rail while being prompted in pursuit of the leaders racing into the turn and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
FORTYEIGHTSTRAIGHT, reserved along the inside dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, steadily gained momentum inside foes racing
into the far turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch, moved to challenge for command in that path midstretch, took over, then went clear late under
firm encouragement. WILD ENOUGH tracked just off the pacesetter between foes racing to the backstretch, advanced to challenge nearing upper stretch
but proved only second best in the drive. SWIFT KID settled between foes off the second flight, gained position three deep racing into the far turn, was
fanned four wide into upper stretch but continued with interest to edge rivals for a share. TIO BLAS, off slowly, was settled along the inside racing to the
backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, tipped out three wide racing through upper stretch and improved his position between foes while just missing for a
share. GOT FLOFFY broke readily, angled inwards dictating the pace on a comfortable margin to the far turn, turned back challengers to maintain the
advantage to midstretch but gave out late. SIERRA CAT angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, bid inside the leader in
upper stretch but was caught in tight quarters nearing the furlong marker and quickly came up empty. AHMAS settled outside foes racing to the backstretch
and failed to menace. GARNETT broke awkwardly, was settled last to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. ODESSA GOLD angled inwards to
track off the second flight between foes in the opening half but steadily faded racing into the far turn. DR. ALBERT, pulling against restraint while racing four
wide into the first turn, was caught wide to the backstretch racing on terms with the second flight and was spent entering the far turn.

AHIMELECH broke readily to attend the pace outside foes racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue outside a rival entering the turn, shook clear
nearing upper stretch while shifting to the inside and held sway to the end under firm left handed encouragement. YES SIR ROBERT tracked off the first
flight outside foes in the opening quarter, angled inwards nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady effort between foes to prove second best. R
GOODTIME CHARLIE, urged between foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing through the backstretch, shifted inwards on the turn dueling
for command and gave way in upper stretch. WALLYPOP tracked off the first flight along the inside and made an effort to improve position inside rivals in
late stages. V. I. P. WHO was rated along the inside in early stages, switched outside foes on the turn, angled four wide entering upper stretch but had no
closing bid. HEATHER'S GOLD vied for command inside foes racing to the turn and gave way nearing the lane. TICKET TO ALASKA proved no factor.

Footnotes
TRUE GRACE, urged to the lead while angling to the inside leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, came under
pressure racing through the far turn to turn back the challenge of PHARAOH FANCY PANT to go clear midstretch and maintained the advantage to the end
under firm handling. The latter, pulling against restraint in early stages, advanced on the pacesetter three wide racing to the backstretch, shifted in to press
the issue racing into the far turn, couldn't match the winner midstretch but continued willingly in the closing stages to close the gap. ADIOS BOBBY was
rated off the second flight while angling inside nearing the first turn, split foes on the backstretch to gain a position just off the leaders along the inside racing
through the far turn, couldn't gain terms with the top pair in the drive and just lasted for a share. CONCRETE CHARLIE was rated off the first flight while
angling to the inside leaving the chute, saved ground while conceding some position midway through the backstretch, continued along the rail to late stages
and finished evenly late while just missing for a share. PARADE GRAND was rated off the second flight racing to the first turn, shifted out four wide on the
backstretch, then continued evenly outside foes to late stages. MUST BE A MONSTER, forwardly placed along the inside, then between rivals racing into
the first turn, was held to track off the first flight entering the backstretch, switched out three deep racing into the far turn and gave way into upper stretch.
PASCAL, off slowly, was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. DRILL BIT, off slowly, settled along the inside and never
gained contention. KALININGRAD dropped out early.

Footnotes
BIG BASE switched outside the leaders racing into the first turn to track the pace under light rating, was prompted to advance three wide after a half,
continued with a sustained response to press the issue in a protracted skirmish past midstretch and wrested a narrow advantage in time under right handed
pressure. SUNDRENCHED sped to the lead while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch,
dueled for command inside foes through the far turn past midstretch, grudgingly resisting the winner to late stages but came up second best. DARLINDIVA,
forwardly placed between foes racing to the backstretch, advanced to press the issue on the far turn past midstretch, weakened in late stages and was
taken up avoiding tight quarters in the final strides. CROWN OF JOY tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide
nearing midstretch carrying out MARVELLA but continued evenly. MARVELLA tracked off the first flight racing four wide to the backstretch, continued three
deep in second flight racing into the far turn, was forced out to the five path nearing midstretch and had no closing response. NOT ORBINARY settled off the
second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes entering the far turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but had no rally.
SASSY MISS MARGIE was rated inside foes tracking the leaders as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch but steadily faded on the far turn.
ROYALBONNIELEGACY threw her head while breaking in the air, then getting away slowly from the gate and trailed the field throughout. FOLLOWING
THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND THE INCIDENT IN LATE STRETCH BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
DOUBLE DOT broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside, came under pressure to turn back challenges nearing upper stretch and
set the balance of the pace under firm right handed pressure on a clear margin. SAYOH broke outwards bumping TABLE ONE, was rated off the pacesetter
along the inside to the backstretch, tipped out racing into upper stretch while being urged to advance but proved only second best. FAST FASHION,
forwardly placed between foes prompting the pacesetter, pressed the issue on the far turn, shifted three wide nearing midstretch and weakened. STARSHIP
HARLEM, caught in tight quarters while held up off the second flight along the inside, came through close quarters along the inside on the far turn, shifted
out three wide entering the lane and continued to improve position. BLAZING ZENNA was rated off the second flight while angling inwards racing to the
backstretch, gained between foes racing through the far turn, steadied avoiding tight quarters nearing upper stretch and lacked the needed final kick.
UPPER SPEED DS angled inwards to track off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted to the rail entering the far turn but had no closing
response. MAGIC SOLUTION, pulling against restraint racing to the first turn, made an early move to gain striking distance four wide after a half but gave
way racing into the far turn. TABLE ONE, bumped at the start, settled along the inside and failed to menace. RED PIXIE was urged to make brief progress
three wide between foes racing to the backstretch but gave way early. NANCYS CONNECTION, off slowly, then rank under restraint, was caught wide to
the backstretch and dropped back early.
