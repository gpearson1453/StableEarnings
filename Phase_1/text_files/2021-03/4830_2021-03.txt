Footnotes
DIAL EM IN lacked early speed, moved up around the turn, split rivals down the stretch and was going away at the end. QUIET TRIP raced in the middle of
the field, came around the turn on the outside, was no match for the winner, but proved an easy second. GIVEN KISSES raced evenly near the middle of
the field, came around the turn wide, made a late bid and proved no match for the top two. DIXIELAND FLASH lacked early speed, showed late interest, but
was no factor. TIZ THE TIME showed early speed, weakened and finished evenly. TODAYISNOTTHEDAY dueled for the early advantage and was finished
early. NO NO NO vied for the early lead and dropped back. SING THE SONG pressed the early pace, saved ground and retreated.
WANDERNINTHEFOREST void of early speed and trailed throughout.

MADISON'S WILD ONE unhurried in the beginning, saved ground around the final turn, pulled away and won easily. CAUGHT HIS EYE pressed the pace,
raced close throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. EBONY BAY raced near the middle of the field, made a mild bid and
finished evenly. GEORGIA DAWN vied for the early lead, saved ground and weakened. TWILIGHT GLOW went to the front, drove clear and faded.
STREETTALKINHOTTIE had an awkward start, racing in the back and was never a threat. MY MALLORY'S ON lost irons, pulled up and walked off.

LIL EVA JANE had an awkward start, racing in the rear, came around both turns wide, swung out entering the home stretch, rallied and proved the best.
MAIDEN ROCK pressed the pace, eased back, made a late gain and was a clear second. IZEONPOINT raced in the middle of the field, moved up on the
inside around the final turn, angled out, made a bid, took the lead, but proved no match for the top two. STONE TOP steadied, broke in, pressed the pace
and weakened. ABIGAIL'S BEAUTY sprinted to the front, drove clear and faded. THIRSTYPROSPECT raced evenly near the back and was no factor.
CHIEF THE GREAT void of early speed and was outrun.
