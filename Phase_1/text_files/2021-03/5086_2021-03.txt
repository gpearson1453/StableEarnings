FLASHY PASS assumed command of the early fractions from a ground saving trip, settled on the turn, was briefly confronted by ROYAL ALEXIS, turned
back that foe and kicked clear for the win. TIZ THE STANDARD settled early, saved ground through the turn, and made a steady run in the drive for second,
though was not catching the winner. ROYAL ALEXIS chased the early pace from a three wide running position along the turn, made a bid at the top of the
stretch to challenge FLASHY PASS, but was turned away by that rival and was outfinished. MERGIE TROID pressed early pace from a two wide path along
the turn, lost position along the turn and tired in the stretch run. GEE STREET was unhurried early, settled at the rear of the field, was four wide along the
turn and had no late response for the stretch drive. TIZAPEPPER settled toward the rear of the field early, saved ground along the turn, and had no late rally
in the stretch.

EVENEREVENWORSE was hustled early to command the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused at the top of the stretch and stayed about his
business to win as much the best. EMPEROR'S FISC chased the early pace from a two wide running position on the turn, continued to chase while close
through the turn, was kept to the task through the drive and just held on for second. CROWN AND PICKLES was unhurried early, settling toward the rear of
the field, came four wide off of the turn and was gaining in the stretch, putting pressure on EMPEROR'S FISC late, but not able to overcome that one for
second. RUNNING TO WIN settled early, two wide on turn, and was outfinished in the stretch. SOULONG was close to the early pace, swung five wide on
the turn, and finished evenly in the drive. WALKING WITH DINO settled early, maintaining a ground saving trip through the turn, was passed coming into the
stretch and tired in the drive. RENEGADE CHIEF stalked the early pace from a three wide position, lost position along the turn and was empty for the
stretch drive. YOU'RE MY VIRGINIA was unhurried early, settling in the three path along the turn and had no late bid in the stretch. FLASH OF GRAY
stalked the early pace from a two wide running position, continued to be close while saving ground into the turn, was outrun on the turn, and faded in the
late stages.

CANNONBALL COMIN pinballed at the start between ROCK SLINGER and ARNO'S MANE MAN, settled toward the rear during the run into the
backstretch, saved ground along the turn, swung three wide for the drive and prevailed. SILENT MOVIES dueled with ROCK SLINGER for the early
fractions, saved ground while in the two path on the turn, was confronted in the final sixteenth by CANNONBALL COMIN and could not hold off that foe.
MISSED THE BOAT settled midpack early, advanced position along the turn, swung four wide off of the turn to mount a late bid but was outfinished in the

and won in a drive. MISS EVER READY unhurried early, settled at the back of the field through the early going, came three wide along the turn and into the
stretch, dueled with LILA AT THE BEACH through the final sixteenth and held on for second. LILA AT THE BEACH pressed the pace from a two wide
position through the backstretch and second turn, dueled MISS EVER READY through the stretch and was just nipped at the wire by that foe for second.
BIG WISH chased the early pace from a ground saving trip, lost position into the stretch and had no late response. LOTSABLING chased the early pace
while saving ground, continued to save ground into the stretch and faded in the drive. PRINCESS ALMA chased the early pace while saving ground the
early stages, lost position along the turn and weakened late.

Footnotes
BREAKING THE CODE pressed the early pace from a two wide running position on the second turn, was asked for run in the stretch, dug in, and held off an
oncoming BORN TO REIGN in the final stages. BORN TO REIGN settled midpack early, advanced position on the second turn while three wide, made a
final late push to pressure BREAKING THE CODE but could not get past that foe for the win. AMERICAN ROYALTY was unhurried early, two wide along
the second turn, gained position into the stretch and finished evenly for third. LUCKY MS JONES had no early speed, four wide off of the second turn, and
put in a mild late bid in the stretch. LIZZY'S INTHEGAME settled midflight early, three wide on the second turn, and had no late response in the stretch.
NORTHERN ROSE stalked the early pace from a ground saving position, lost position along the second turn and was outrun in the stretch. INDIAN
DANCER assumed command of early fractions while saving ground, began tiring entering the stretch and was empty late.
