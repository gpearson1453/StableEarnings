COLTON'S COMMAND was unhurried early in the two-path, swung four wide gathering momentum approaching the stretch, ran by SHAFTESBURY from
outside while mildly roused past the furlong marker and drew off hand urged. SHAFTESBURY was difficult to load, came away in good order to press
FORTIFIED from outside, took over soon after completing six furlongs, then was no match for the winner past the eighth-pole. INCITATUS saved ground
early under a stout hold, moved to the two-path being asked at the head of the lane, and was outfinished. TIZ TACT TOE broke inward, raced three wide in
the second flight to the stretch, and improved without threatening. CITY TAVERN was forced in at the start by TIZ TACT TOE, lagged well back early, and
improved without factoring. OUR INTEGRITY came in after the start, stayed in range to the stretch two to three wide, and tired. FORTIFIED bumped with
MUSK at the start, set a pressured pace inside for six furlongs, and gave way. CAMPEADOR was strung out four wide on the first turn, and gave way
outside before reaching the stretch. SI COMO NO was outrun inside. WAR BOMBER (IRE) prompted the early pace three wide, and tired. MUSK bumped
with FORTIFIED at the start, and was never close. GOING BESERK walked out of the gate two to three lengths slow, and was far back throughout.

Footnotes
TEXTPECTATION lagged well back down the backstretch, advanced four wide around the turn, shifted widest in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside
and was up in the final strides. AYCAPOTE dueled inside of SWING WEST past the sixteenth pole, edged ahead of that foe but was nailed by the winner.
SWING WEST dueled two wide to deep stretch, continued on the left lead and was outfinished. MYSTICAL MOON steadied nearing the three-quarters pole,
raced in range in traffic two and three wide around the turn, was one-paced in behind rivals in the lane and swung out late. DOCTOR D J settled off the
pace outside, bid four wide around the turn but faded in the lane. CANDY CRUSHEM steadied nearing the three-quarters pole, stalked the pace three wide
and came up empty in the lane. MINISTER'S STRIKE failed to menace while racing two wide. MOZO BELLO was up close inside and retreated in the lane.
ZONIC was outrun while racing two wide. CHARLIE THE GREEK was outrun inside.

Footnotes
I GET IT broke slowly and trailed in the two-path for a half-mile, began moving around the far turn while swinging out four wide, rallied strongly to overhaul
the leaders from outside entering the final furlong and edged away. WORLD TOUR bumped with LA LIBERTEE at the start, prompted the pace under a hold
two wide, dove to the rail with a bid in upper stretch and finished gamely. HIT THE WOAH was never far back, advanced off the far turn three wide, bid
between horses through the furlong grounds but did not have quite enough. LINE DANCING saved ground toward the rear to the far turn, moved out for the
drive and rallied willingly. COWORTH PARK hugged the rail to the stretch, moved out near the eighth-pole and finished evenly. JOY OF PAINTING set an
easy pace inside for six furlongs, drifted off the fence turning for home, and was overrun from both sides. LA LIBERTEE bumped with WORLD TOUR at the
start, prompted the pace three then two wide, got out-moved through the furlong grounds and steadied behind horses, and dropped back. BALL
LIGHTNING was no factor two wide.

BASIN raced three to four wide around the turn, rallied to contention through upper stretch, fought late between horses and gamely prevailed. FROSTED
GRACE vied outside SHIVAREE for a half-mile, took over going comfortably late on the turn, edged clear in upper stretch, drifted out late under heavy
pressure and saved the place. TOWN CLASSIC was unhurried early, swung widest in the five-path turning for home, ranged up outside the leaders a
furlong out, and was outfinished under light urging. YODEL E. A. WHO broke two lengths slow, moved up inside behind the leaders midway up the
backstretch, shifted out in the stretch and lacked a final bid. SHIVAREE vied early inside FROSTED GRACE, could not keep pace with that one after a half,
and faded steadily. LETMENO broke two lengths slow, and was outrun two to three wide. COOL ARROW tracked outside the leaders three wide, and was
empty under a drive leaving the turn.

Footnotes
GRAY'S FABLE set the pace along the rail, shrugged off a bid from EVER DANGEROUS nearing the quarter pole, re-cleared in upper stretch and held
clear under a drive. RENAISANCE FROLIC tracked the pace two wide, came three wide into the lane and finished willingly to be a clear second. EVER
DANGEROUS prompted the winner two wide, bid nearing the quarter pole, could not keep pace in upper stretch but stayed on to hold third. PERFECT
SPEIGHTY went evenly inside. SEISMIC WAVE was off a bit slow, trailed inside early, angled three wide near the quarter pole and never threatened.
FOREVER MO played no factor while racing two wide. LITTLE MENACE failed to menace while racing three wide. FROSTMOURNE bobbled at the break,
saved ground while pulling through the opening half, went two wide around the far turn and had no response.

Footnotes
NO ORDINARY TIME settled in midpack for six furlongs, rallied three then four wide coming off the far turn, reached the front past the eighth-pole and
edged CADENCIA after a late duel. CADENCIA lagged far back early, circled five wide into the stretch, rallied outside NO ORDINARY TIME, and was
edged to the finish while able to save second. NORTH COUNTRY FAIR (GB) was far back for six furlongs, came widest for the drive and finished strongly.
COMMUNITY ADJUSTED raced in the two-path most of the way, and finished with interest. CONUNDRUM QUEEN bobbled along the inside midway on the
first turn, put in a mild run two wide leaving the far turn, then flattened out. CHARGES DROPPED chased the pacesetter from outside to the stretch, and
gave way through the last eighth of a mile. UNSHAKABLE U set the pace inside, was under a drive at the top of the stretch, and had nothing left a furlong
out. BADGER KITTEN advanced mildly three then four wide after six furlongs, but could not sustain the bid. KIND WAYS raced three to four wide for six
furlongs, moved inward turning for home, and lacked a closing response inside. MY DESDEMONA stayed in range for six furlongs, and tired inside.
AMERICAN HEIRESS (GB) raced three wide on the turns, and gave way into the lane. BELLE PLAIN was slow into stride, and showed little.

EYE OF A JEDI settled off the pace along the inside, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths marker, closed outside, seized command near the eighth
pole and drew off under a drive. LAST JUDGMENT set a pressured pace along the rail, put away the pace rivals near the quarter pole but was no match for
the winner in the final furlong. SUPERFECTO pressed the pace two wide, weakened in the lane but easily bested the rest. WAR STOPPER was in range
four wide and faded around the far turn. JUST WHISTLE played no factor while racing three wide. KING SLEW (ARG) was outrun while racing three and
four wide. VIOLENT CITY had early speed three wide between foes, stopped and was eased.

SAYYAAF took control soon after the start, rated along on a clear lead to the stretch, and held firm under a mild drive. NOBLE INDY lunged at the break,
rushed up outside through the stretch the first time, pursued the winner throughout and held well for the place. FIRST PREMIO was never far back, rallied
four wide off the far turn to loom a threat, but could not gain through the stretch on his left lead. CHOCOLATE BAR settled in midpack for six furlongs, came
four wide into the lane, and lacked a solid response. HAY DAKOTA broke slowly, lagged well back for six furlongs two then three wide, and passed tired
horses. SUMMER TO REMEMBER hugged the rail throughout, and had no rally. FORTUNE'S FOOL raced in the second flight throughout and never
factored. BLAMELESS raced forwardly two to three wide, and tired after six furlongs. MALIBU MAMBO raced three wide early, and never reached
contention. SAND DANCER was outrun inside. NIXON JOY (ARG) broke slowly and showed little.

CHURN N BURN cleared early, rated a clear lead inside and held clear under a drive. MOON OVER MIAMI raced two wide in midpack, angled out nearing
the lane and rallied to gain the place in deep stretch. CROSS BORDER was off a step slow, rushed up inside to gain a stalking position at the rail, remained
there around all three turns, tipped out in upper stretch and was outkicked. SADLER'S JOY lacked early speed while racing two wide, advanced three wide
around the far turn, loomed boldly near the quarter pole but flattened out in the drive. SIR SAHIB played no factor while racing two wide. TEMPLE saved
ground and failed to menace. RIJEKA (IRE) saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. ANGELUS WARRIOR stalked
the winner two wide and came up empty in the lane. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

ANNEX went along two wide and in striking distance to the far turn, swung four wide roused into the stretch, kicked in determinedly and was up in time
outside rivals. FULMINI secured the garden spot saving ground in the clear off the leaders, was guided outside them three wide coming off the far turn, bid
through the furlong grounds and finished gamely between horses. IT CAN BE DONE vied outside KING OF DREAMS from the outset, got the best of that
dispute by mid stretch, moved to the rail and stayed on tenaciously inside the top two. LUCKY LAW (IRE) hit the left side of the gate and bumped with
FIGHTING FORCE coming out, raced in the second flight to the far turn, moved out four wide at the top of the stretch, and brushed with HYPERFOCUS
while inside that foe and gaining gradually to the finish. HYPERFOCUS saved ground outrun for six furlongs, came two wide into the stretch, had some late
interest and brushed with LUCKY LAW while in close quarters. KING OF DREAMS set the pace inside while hounded by IT CAN BE DONE, and gave way
entering the final furlong. FIGHTING FORCE bumped with LUCKY LAW at the break, and failed to menace inside. STEP DANCER spotted the field a
couple lengths at the start, and was never in contention.

Footnotes
CRAZY BEAUTIFUL was reluctant to load, settled off the pace along the inside, advanced three wide between foes around the far turn, found clear sailing
outside turning for home, surged to the front in midstretch and cleared off under a mild drive. MILLEFEUILLE was caught wide entering the first turn, angled
into the two path midway around that bend raced off the pace between rivals, bid three wide around the far turn, seized command near the quarter pole, led
to midstretch but was no match for the winner late. COMPETITIVE SPEED raced off the pace four wide early, advanced five wide around the far turn and
stayed on to gain the show. CON LIMA bumped with BOW BOW GIRL at the start, set the pace under pressure from that rival, gave way near the quarter
pole, angled out in upper stretch and continued to fade. PENS STREET tracked the pace three wide, edged closer four wide around the far turn and came
up empty in the lane. BOW BOW GIRL bumped with CON LIMA at the start, pressed the pace two wide and tired nearing the lane. LEN LO LADY saved
ground in range and retreated nearing the lane.

Footnotes
WAR LIKE GODDESS saved ground unhurried for a mile, moved out five wide approaching the stretch, rallied relentlessly and was up outside ALWAYS
SHOPPING in the final strides. ALWAYS SHOPPING settled in easy striking range to the third turn, rallied three wide past the quarter-pole, caught SISTER
HANAN from outside through the furlong grounds and edged away, then drifted out under heavy left-hand pressure and could not hold on while clearly
second best. SORREL (IRE) went along in the second flight near the two-path early, took the third turn three then four wide, rallied mildly outside and was
up for the show while no threat to the top two. DELTA'S KINGDOM raced three wide on the turns, and lacked the needed closing response. SISTER
HANAN took over outside BELLE LAURA on the first turn, moved inside showing the way and picking up the tempo after six furlongs, could not handle
ALWAYS SHOPPING coming to the eighth-pole and gave way. MORNING MOLLY saved ground throughout, and faded in the drive. CRYSTALLE raced
two to three wide at the back, and made no headway through the lane. BELLE LAURA led into the first turn but yielded to SISTER HANAN approaching the
stretch the first time, stayed on the chase for a mile, and had nothing left turning for home. DIZZY raced in the middle of the field while saving ground to the
stretch, and tired.

KNOWN AGENDA settled off the early pace two wide, angled to the rail midway around the first turn, saved ground in in midpack from there to the
five-sixteenths marker, angled three wide to move between rivals nearing the quarter pole, put a head in front turning for home, quickly drew clear in upper
stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging to the sixteenth pole then angled in while well clear. SOUP AND SANDWICH prompted the pace three wide
around the first turn, set the pace two wide down the backstretch and around the far turn, was collared in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through
most of the stretch and stayed on well to be a clear second. GREATEST HONOUR was unhurried while racing two wide around the first turn, made some
progress inside down the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, tipped three wide leaving the quarter pole and was one-paced through
the lane. NOVA RAGS bumped with QUANTUM LEAP at the start, set the early pace along the rail, pressed inside of SOUP AND SANDWICH down the
backstretch and around the far turn and weakened in the stretch. COLLABORATE bumped with SPIELBERG at the start, stalked the pace four wide and
had little left for the drive. SOUTHERN PASSAGE lagged far back inside, went two wide around the far turn and passed tiring rivals. PAPETU failed to
menace while racing four and five wide. SPIELBERG was bumped at the start, raced four to five wide around both turns and never threatened. QUANTUM
LEAP bobbled a bit and bumped NOVA RAGS at the start, had early speed two wide, went three wide around the far turn and faltered. JIRAFALES was
outrun inside. SIGILOSO bobbled at the break, raced three wide in midpack and retreated around the far turn.
