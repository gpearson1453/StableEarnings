move passing the quarter pole and gained ground steadily on the outside to get up in the final sixteenth of a mile. HALO HUNTER led the field from the rail
up the backstretch and around the turn, dueled with an outside challenger in upper stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS
raced off the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and gained ground mildly down the lane. MIAS MOONBEAM trailed the field up
the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and made no bid. AMERICAN HERITAGE pressed the pace on the outside early, moved up to

DEMAND RANSOM disputed the early pace inside of POWER CRY, prompted the pace inside of that foe past the half mile mark, overtook him in the two
path near the three eighths, opened a clear lead into upper stretch, and held sway under a drive. SOUTHSIDER broke in and bumped FRENCH MINDED in
the opening strides, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and while saving ground on the turn, went to a drive inside in upper stretch, proved no
match for DEMAND RANSOM, but chased on willingly while drifting out. JUSTENUFFTUFF chased midpack down the backstretch and in the three path on
the turn, was driven between horses in upper stretch, was taken out five wide near the three sixteenths, and continued to improve mildly under a drive in the
lane. POWER CRY broke outward, raced keenly in the leading pair early, pulled to the lead past the half mile mark, briefly set the pace in the three path
while being pressed by DEMAND RANSOM to his inside, was headed by that foe near the three eighths, proved no match two wide into the lane, and
weakened. ELUSIVE FORCE was grazed by POWER CRY in the opening strides, settled at the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, was driven for an
inside bid into the lane, but leveled out in the final furlong. FRENCH MINDED was bumped by SOUTHSIDER in the opening strides, settled near the rear,
offered a mild bid under a drive in the four path on the turn, continued under a drive four wide into the lane, and emptied out.

Footnotes
SHEZ STUCK UP disputed the early pace outside of GOLD GEM, was pushed along past the half mile pole, opened up in the two path, drew off further
under a drive in the lane and proved much the best. BIRD KEY settled third last well behind the leading and tracking flights, chased in the four path on the
turn, swung into the seven path in upper stretch and went to a drive, and improved outside to prove best of the rest. GOLD GEM disputed the early pace
inside of SHEZ STUCK UP, could not match stride with her past the half mile mark, raced in the tracking flight while hugging the rail on the turn, was urged
inside into the lane, kept on willingly but was outfinished for the place. MISSEN THE POINT tracked the leading pair three wide on the backstretch, raced in
the two to three path in the tracking flight on the turn, was driven between horses in upper stretch, and flattened out in the final furlong. PERFECT SMOKEY
EYE tracked the leading pair while racing along the rail on the backstretch, was pushed along to keep up in the three path on the turn, was driven three wide
in upper stretch, and weakened. SHE APPEALS HOLY settled in second last far behind the main group while still well clear of the trailing horse, swung into
the lane in the six path, was driven, but lacked the needed rally. PIPPITY DO DA hit the gate and veered out at the start, soon trailed far behind the field,
came into the lane in the three to four path, offered no bid and was allowed to trail home.

Footnotes
ORDAINED KISS raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, began a bid approaching the three eighths pole, swung five wide
entering the stretch and dueled gamely down the stretch to prevail on the outside. MORA VALLEY was reluctant to load, broke well to lead the field up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and dueled gamely in the stretch, getting caught late. DEVIL'S ROSE raced off the pace on the inside
through the opening stages, came around the turn in the two path, began a bid at the head of the stretch and improved position on the rail from there.
DUSTY MILLER chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began his move nearing the three eighths pole, entered the stretch four wide and
weakened slightly between horses in the final sixteenth. HEY HEY chased the frontrunner on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the
three path around the turn and finished evenly, getting outkicked late. PRAISEM broke a step slowly, trailed the field on the outside early, continued around
the turn in the two path and made no bid. MY FOUROONE KPLAN raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around
the turn and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
ARCH FLYER was sent to the front, set a pressured pace down the backstretch, vied inside of HELEN MAE'S SONG on the turn, was driven to a defined
lead into upper stretch, kept on gamely inside horses under a drive and held. HYPNOTISING chased the leading trio inside of BODEMAX down the
backstretch and in the two path on the turn, raced between horses into the lane, altered inside of a fading horse in upper stretch, rallied under a drive but
missed between horses. SUPERSTAR DIVA settled at the rear, was pushed along from near the three eighths while racing in the two to three path, bid
inside horses into the stretch, was taken out three wide near the three sixteenths and then guided five wide near midstretch, found her best in the final
sixteenth and missed. KIANA'S LOVE was away sharply, attended the leading flight three wide, proved no match for the pacesetter from the quarter pole,
and ran evenly late. LIL B QUICK raced keenly while wrangled back to second last, was taken outside near the seven sixteenths while still difficult to control,
raced in the six path around the bend, trailed in upper stretch, and offered a mild belated rally in the final furlong while drifting further out. HELEN MAE'S
SONG pressed the pace between horses down the backstretch, vied outside of ARCH FLYER on the turn, was no match for that foe past the quarter, and
weakened between horses. BODEMAX chased midpack, was pushed along into the turn outside of HYPNOTISING, chased in the five path around the
bend, went to a drive in upper stretch, and weakened. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THERE WAS NO FIVE EIGHTHS TIME.

ANTRIM'S GIANT saved ground around the first turn, stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail nearing the three eighths
pole and chased the winner home, gaining ground late. CANDY STORE fought his rider while racing in close quarters in the two path around the first turn,
trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, swung out to find racing room in upper stretch and gained ground
late on the outside. LEMON BLITZ raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside,

first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and tired in the stretch. AMENDED raced in the

Footnotes
EDISON FIRE was pushed along to show pace inside, led into the clubhouse turn, took pressure past the thirteen sixteenths from TWO COOKIE RULE to
his outside, edged clear of that foe near the five eighths, saved ground through the turn, kept his head in front as FLASHY RICHIE loomed to his outside
near the five sixteenths, turned back that foe when driven in upper stretch, and edged further clear under continued urging. FLASHY RICHIE was fractious
in the gate and grazed it on the way out, tracked between horses on the first turn, continued to track the leading pair down the backstretch, rallied three wide
on the far turn, loomed outside of EDISON FIRE from near the five sixteenths into the stretch, could not get past that foe under a drive, and was taken in
hand late. KING ZION raced at the inside of the tracking flight through the clubhouse turn, settled back to the rear of the main pack into the backstretch,
improved position past the half mile mark while hugging the rail, proved no match for the leading pair into the lane, but chased on best of the rest under a
drive. TO THE BANK came away sharply, tracked the pace four wide around the clubhouse turn, chased outside horses down the backstretch and in the
three to four path on the far turn, was driven between foes in upper stretch and failed to find the needed kick. TWO COOKIE RULE was bumped in the
opening strides by B'S TURNING POINT, tracked three wide between horses around the first turn, pulled to prompt outside the pacesetter past the thirteen
sixteenths, tracked behind that leader as he cleared again near the five eighths, began to lose ground past the half mile mark, raced two wide around the far
turn, was driven in upper stretch but proved empty for the drive. OFF TO THE BEACH hit the gate while breaking slowly, settled outside of B'S TURNING
POINT in the rear pair while racing well behind the main track, continued in the trailing pair in the three path on the far turn, and never mustered a rally. B'S
TURNING POINT broke outward and bumped TWO COOKIE RULE in the opening strides, settled inside of OFF TO THE BEACH well behind the leading
pair, was urged in the two path on the far turn and driven in upper stretch, but offered no response. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE MILE TIME
WAS UNAVAILABLE.
