TWO SIXTYONE just off leaders to turn, split horses into the stretch to go away late under good handling in the late going. SUGARSUGARSUGAR never
far back outside with a steady run from turn for the place spot. MYEERAH set a pressured pace to deep stretch but weakened in late going. COLDWATER
quick outside, pressed leader to turn but weakened, in the drive with no excuse. A. P. PRINCESS raced evenly with no response when needed. HEAVEN
ESCAPE never untracked throughout. HOLLYWOOD HOOPLA raced close up to turn, gave way readily in the stretch run. PER RULING #21-0053 FROM
THE KENTUCKY RACING COMMISSION, MYEERAH WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 3rd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

WOMEN NOT EASY raced a horrific trip inside, when finally clear out of far turn, rallied and proved tons best under good handling. CATCH MY KITTY
unhurried early, bid into far turn and rallied along for place while no match. OUT OF POCKET outrun to far turn, drifted widest into stretch and moved up for
show spot. OXBOW'S RUBY no speed, moved up steadily to improve position in the stretch. SMARTY ARTIE outrun to far turn checked hard inside quarter
pole no recovery. CRYPTO CAT outside trip with good position, strong bid quarter pole, empty. POPPY'S GIRL never far back, dueled past quarter pole,
flattened out in drive. TWIRLING DERVISH raced back to turn, mild bid with no late kick when needed. MIDNIGHT CLASS outside run first turn, drifted
widest into the stretch run. MISS O' PRADO dueled to the half, caved from the quarter pole. MIRIANA'S QUEEN had a sharp break and was through early,
stopped badly and struggled to the wire while far back.
