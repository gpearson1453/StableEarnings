MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT trailed inside for a half, made good progress inside of foes around the far turn, tipped two wide in upper stretch, split rivals near the
eighth pole and drove clear soon after. SHADILEE saved ground in midpack, went two wide around the far turn, angled further out in upper stretch and
rallied for the place. JUDY'S WAY pressed the pace two wide, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and held for the show. CAT LADY set the pace along the rail
past the eighth pole and weakened. PARDON MY HEART failed to menace while racing three and four wide. DIVIDED SKY (IRE) stalked the pace three
wide and faded in the lane. TWILIGHT never threatened while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
NIMBLE BEAST vied inside early, edged away around the turn, drew well clear through upper stretch and was kept busy to the end. RACK GIN broke
slowly and trailed for a half-mile, moved out leaving the turn and rallied to go clear of the rest. METEORITO was a step slow to begin, saved ground around
the turn, rallied mildly into the lane but flattened out late. ONE EYED JACK raced three then two wide around the turn, and lacked a closing response.
CAPITAN FOFO shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, and made no headway. EMICRACK (CHI) contested the early pace outside NIMBLE BEAST,
could not match strides around the turn, and gave way. CHAMBERLAIN tracked outside the early leaders three wide, and was finished before going a half.

LEASE pressed the pace two wide, took the lead in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. MUTARAAFEQ raced off the pace four wide, rallied mildly
while lugging in and gained the place. SHOOTING was fractious in the gate, bumped at the start, was in range inside, angled three wide nearing the
five-sixteenth marker and was one-paced in the lane. NAHUATL prompted the pace three wide, dropped back around the turn, angled in nearing the lane
and lacked a stretch bid. WEIGHT OF GLORY set the pace along the rail, vied inside of the winner to midstretch then tired. SANDY DUDE bumped with
SHOOTING at the start, dropped far back and trailed throughout.

POR QUE NO tracked three wide for six furlongs. took over outside SUNSHINE CITY and edged away in mid stretch, swapped back to her left lead and
was all out to hold on. KATE'S KINGDOM brushed a few times with CHEVALITA after the start, settled within range to the far turn, swung four wide into the
stretch, finished gamely and was gaining outside the winner to the wire. SUNSHINE CITY set the pace inside, got overhauled by the winner coming to the
furlong marker, and yielded on the rail. LULLULA raced close up inside to the stretch, was boxed in along the rail through the furlong grounds and could
never be fully set down. PRETTY RACHEL pressed the pace two wide, lodged a mild bid between horses a quarter-mile out, then weakened through the
lane. WINTER PRINCESS checked sharply while being forced out to the four-path by CHEVALITA into the first turn, moved inside leaving the backstretch,
tried to get through on the rail in upper stretch to no avail and steadied, altered course outside and ran on one-paced. CHEVELITA brushed with KATE'S
KINGDOM several times after the start, became rank and got out into the first turn, remained tough to handle six wide into the backstretch, got pulled up
after a half-mile and walked off.

MID DAY IMAGE settled off the fast pace in the clear inside, advanced two wide around the far turn, closed outside and was up in the final strides. ABIDING
STAR sprinted off to a clear lead inside, held clear past the sixteenth pole, switched back to the left lead late and was nailed on the wire. CALABASH raced
closest to the pacesetter two wide and finished evenly to hold the show. J P HELLISH saved ground and failed to menace. TUSK saved ground off the pace,
angled three wide nearing the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. TIZZARUNNER played no factor while racing two wide. RECKLESS SPIRIT was
outrun while racing two and three wide.

BERHANU broke outward, saved ground close up into the turn, moved out three wide near the five-sixteenths, took over outside THOROVER in upper
stretch, and drew clear staying on his left lead. EMIT was outsprinted early, swung four wide coming off the turn, rallied on the far outside and was up for the
place, then was vanned off after the finish. THOROVER bumped with BARREL PROOF after the start, pressed the latter from outside early, reached the
front approaching the quarter-pole, was no match for the winner into the stretch and weakened. BACH raced in range three wide to the stretch, and was
outfinished for larger shares between horses. PERUVIAN DANCER was forced out by BERHANU at the start, raced three wide and could not reach
contention. CRAZY SHOT was hustled along inside after the start, lost some position up the backstretch, and had no rally. BARREL PROOF bumped with
THOROVER after the start, dashed clear early and moved inside, shortened stride noticeably in upper stretch, and was being gathered up through the last
sixteenth of a mile. C. P. A. GENIUS was slow into stride, and showed little at the rear.

Footnotes
FOOLISH HEART broke outward, dashed clear early and moved inside, responded when set down in the stretch and remained well in command. DEM A
WONDER waited behind the pacesetter and inside INCLUDE THE BEAST around the turn, came two wide finding a clear lane at the top of the stretch,
could not reach the winner and was clearly second best. INCLUDE THE BEAST pursued the leader two then three wide for a half-mile, could not make
progress through the stretch and was best of the remainder. LIGHTS ON GIRL was floated out a bit by FOOLISH HEART at the start, moved inside entering
the turn, and posed no threat. LEYENDA moved off the inside to the three-path approaching the stretch, and made no headway. NICOLE PRINCESS broke
a step slowly, raced three to four wide, and tired through the stretch.

Footnotes
PILLAR MOUNTAIN (IRE) settled off the pace while racing two wide between rivals, angled three wide near the quarter pole, closed outside, seized
command near the eighth pole and powered clear. CALL CURT led two wide early, settled back when TROUBLE COFFEE sprinted clear turning into the
stretch the first time, re-bid two wide midway down the backstretch, vied two wide to midstretch, could not match strides with the winner but stayed on
willingly to hold the place. GO POKE THE BEAR saved ground off the pace, moved up two wide around the far turn, swung out in upper stretch, bid nearing
the eighth pole but was outkicked. BASHA saved ground off the pace, tipped in upper stretch, continued on the left lead was one-paced between foes.
PREFECT trailed inside for ten furlongs, cut the corner into the lane, got through seamlessly, bid inside nearing the eighth pole and flattened out.
COWTOWN was squeezed back at the start, raced off the pace three wide, made a middle move into contention outside, remained up close three wide
rounding the far turn but faded in the lane. COUNTER OFFER failed to menace while racing four wide. TROUBLE COFFEE vied inside early, ran off nearing
the lane the first time, set the pace inside to upper stretch and tired. FOCUS GROUP played no factor while racing two and three wide. CIBOLIAN chased
the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane.

LIESEL took closer order three wide approaching the quarter-pole, wrested command through upper stretch outside TRASHTHETRAILER and HOT BABE,
and moved away through the late stages. HOT BABE pressed TRASHTHETRAILER two wide, battled between horses at the top of the stretch, and came
up second best. ADDI broke slowly, moved out leaving the turn, and was along for the show outside. TRASHTHETRAILER set the pace inside, got collared
turning for home, and gave way on the rail. CAPTURED LIGHT was put to a drive midway on the turn, and made no progress. MYSTICAL CHARGE was
outrun three to four wide. ST. LOUIE ARCH was outrun throughout. QUEEN ASHY BABY was never prominent. SENORITA SALSA tired after a half-mile
inside.
