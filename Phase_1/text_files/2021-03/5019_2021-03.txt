stretch then dug in determinedly but was nailed on the wire. MARZANNA pressed the leader early, made a run two wide to engage for the lead but was
outkicked in upper stretch and finished evenly. WATCHFUL EYE chased the pace three wide to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch and did not rally.
FICTIONAL stalked the leaders two wide to the stretch but weakened in the drive. BROADWAY BABE broke a bit slow, had no speed and saved ground to
no avail. ZEPHYR CAT broke slow and was always outrun.

Footnotes
SEAHAWK CODY bobbled shortly after the start then was unhurried to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, shifted out widest and responded in
the final furlong and surged in the late stages to win going away. TWICE THE PRICE pressed the pace to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch,
dueled to mid stretch then inched away late but was overtaken by the winner. STREET DANCING set the pace while off the rail to the stretch then drifted in
slightly in upper stretch and again at the eighth pole, straightened, stayed to deep stretch then weakened. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS settled to the half,
raced two wide on the second turn, tried to rally inside of STREET DANCING in upper stretch but was crowded and checked at the three sixteenths then
again bid inside that one but was cut off, had to steady leaving the furlong grounds and finished evenly. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch
run involving STREET DANCING and CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS and disqualified STREET DANCING from third to fourth for interference.

BEE EINSTEIN broke alertly and went right to the front, set all the pace off the rail to the stretch then pushed clear to mid stretch and widened under steady
urging. CLOCHARD STREET stalked the winner three wide to the stretch, could not impact that one but was not threatened for second. ICE KITTY got
outsprinted to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. JUMPING JILL FLASH pressed the winner from the rail to the
stretch but tired through the final furlong. SUPER BUNNY had no speed and trailed throughout.

BABY FRANKIE chased the leaders to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch and held driving. MEGAMEISTER
dueled for the lead outside of STACKIN SILVER, responded to pressure on the second turn, got outkicked by the winner to mid stretch but dug in gamely to
hold second. T BONES TRICK bumped with PUSH THROUGH at the start, settled to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch and finished in a
mild rally. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) was chasing for a half mile, raced two wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly.
PUSH THROUGH bumped with T BONES TRICK at the start, had no speed, was two wide to the stretch and did not rally. STACKIN SILVER hustled to
contest the pace from the rail for six furlongs then was outrun in upper stretch and tired. FINAL FINAL had no speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PRINCE ON THE RUN pressed the pace early, was three wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and overtook LOCKWOOD to prevail. LOCKWOOD set
the pace while in the two path to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then could not stall the winner and got the nod for second. MR. ARTISTIC was
chasing early and eased in to race in the two path on the turn, rallied steadily late but was outnodded for second. GOVENOR'S GAMBLE stalked the pace
in the three path to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task and was gaining late. TRIBUNAL LOVE got outsprinted to the turn, raced two
wide to the stretch and also made up ground belatedly. STARK MARK tracked the leaders early then dropped back on the turn and gave out in the stretch.
EFFECTIVE UNION was very green, dropped far back then eased in the stretch but walked off.

FACTS MATTER set the pace to the turn, inched away to the stretch then responded to pressure and held determinedly. SEQUENTIALLY stalked the
winner early, was fanned four wide to the stretch then finished well to hold second. REAL TROUBLE pressed the winner three wide, eased in for the stretch
run but could not impact the top two. HONEYMOONZ OVER had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch and was gaining ground late. CLEM LABINE
chased the pace in the two path, was in tight behind rivals nearing the quarter pole, steadied and dropped back then finished willingly. OISEAU DE
GUERRE tracked the pace three wide, eased out in upper stretch but lacked the needed late response. The jockey aboard CLEM LABINE lodged an
objection against both REAL TROUBLE and SEQUENTIALLY but it was not allowed by the stewards.

Footnotes
TONI TWO POCKET attended the pace outside ANA LISA, was two wide to the stretch, edged clear to mid stretch under urging and held driving. SHEZA
GIRLY GIRL got outsprinted to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch and closed steadily outside rivals. HABOBANERO stalked the pace from the rail
to the stretch, remained a factor to mid stretch then was outfinished. THIS IS THE ONE chased the leaders to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, loomed
a threat to mid stretch then lost her punch. DR WYSONG had no speed, was two wide on the turn then eased out and was showing some late interest.
PENTEWAN (GB) got outsprinted early, came two then three wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. PERFECT STORIES was outrun to
the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch and also did not rally. SMILING SPIRIT had no speed and was never a threat. ANA LISA hustled to contest the
pace from the rail to the stretch then gave out.

was rank inside runners early while a bit green, saved ground on the turn and finished willingly inside in a good bow. BROCK ON BY had no speed, bid
three wide into the turn then swung out five deep into the stretch and closed steadily. SQUARE ROOT attended the pace outside the winner and three wide
to the stretch, battled on to the sixteenth marker then was outfinished. FAITHFUL SON got outsprinted to the turn, bid two wide to the stretch, was up to
briefly loom a threat in mid stretch then finished evenly. BARHOPSKY had no speed, circled rivals five wide on the turn and did not threaten in the drive. LIL
MIRACLE MAN got outsprinted to the turn, was pushed out to the five path into the stretch and did not rally. MOOGIE CAT stalked the pace four wide to the
