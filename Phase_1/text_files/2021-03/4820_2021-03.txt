SHERIFF BROWN unhurried in the beginning, moved up around the second turn, rallied down the lane and got up in time. PADDOCK PICK sprinted to the
front, pulled away and got caught at the wire. NATE'S ATTACK raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two.
FLYING HONEYPOT raced near the back in the early part, made a mild bid, but was no factor. LANGS DAY void of early speed, trailing the field, closed the
gap around the final turn and passed a tiring rival down the stretch. JIMI'S A STAR raced within contention, saved ground, faded and was no threat late.

DIALED J raced within contention, made a strong move around the final turn, collared the leader down the stretch and prevailed for the win. STAR
FASHION broke out, bobbled at the start, racing from the back, rallied around the second turn, rallied down the stretch and needed more ground. BACK
INTHAT ACTION vied for the early advantage, took command, lacked a finish and was outkicked by the top two. ANNIE SULLIVAN challenged for the early
lead and weakened down the home stretch. C. F. SHELAUH raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. WHILE MY GUITAR lacked early
speed and was never a threat. MISS MIRACLE GIRL raced near the back, lacked a bid and was outrun. THEBOYZTAP raced within striking distance, came
around the first turn four wide and dropped back.

SUCKERFORAGREY vied for the early lead, challenged on the front end throughout, pulled away down the final stretch and proved the best. MOLLY
GOLIGHTLY unhurried in the early going, moved up around the final turn, made a late rally down the stretch and got up for second. COOL SPRING dueled
for the early lead, raced close throughout and was outfinished late for second. SILVER SIREN lacked early speed, finished wide and was never a factor.
LADY RAD challenged for the early advantage, raced four wide around the first turn and weakened. ORETTA raced within striking distance and dropped
back.

TOP DRAW dueled for the early lead, challenged throughout, pulled away at the end and proved much the best. CHARLIES TICKET was an early factor,
saved ground around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but got by LIKEN IT for second. LIKEN IT pressed the pace, forwardly placed
throughout and was outfinished for second. HEZA PRIORITY raced near the back in the early part, showed late interest, but was no real threat. MUFFIN
NUTS raced in the back of the pack in the early going, made a mild bid, finishing wide, but was no factor. MUSCADINE raced near the back, came around
the second turn on the outside, made a mild bid and hung. TURN ON THE MAGIC pressed the pace and dropped back.

Footnotes
I'M LOOKING UP vied for the early advantage, drove clear around the turn, pulled away down the stretch and won handily. MOVE IT unhurried in the early
part, racing near the middle of the field, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. CUSTOM KAT lacked early speed, made
a late rail bid and got up for third. SUPERCONDUCTOR raced within striking distance, finished wide and lacked a rally. SECRET REDEMPTION raced in
the back of the pack, improved position, but was no factor. KATAMA BAY pressed the early pace and faded. KRISYNSARASBOY raced in the middle of the
field, came around the turn wide and was never a threat. WAR SONG showed early speed, was finished early and dropped back down the home stretch.
LIONS HOT MESS bobbled at the start, raced near the back and showed little.

close throughout and proved third best. LA JAZZ lacked early speed, raced outside around the final turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. LADY'S
TRIBUTE void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no threat. NATIVE TRIP pressed the early pace and faded. VALID BREAK dueled for the early
advantage and was finished early. STAR'S GOLD MINE raced near the middle of the field, dropped back and was no threat late. MADELYN'S MOMENT
