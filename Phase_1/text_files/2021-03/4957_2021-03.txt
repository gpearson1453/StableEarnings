Footnotes
MULHIMA (IRE) sat just off of the early pace while saving ground along the backstretch and second turn, slipped through along the rail to make a late bid
and prevailed over ODESSA. ODESSA took command of the early pace while traveling in the two path down the backside and second turn, left the rail open
in the stretch, allowing MULHIMA to slip through and could not hold off that rival. SPLASHING was unhurried early, saving ground at the rear of the field
through the early stages, was two wide along the second turn and made a late move to get into contention in the stretch but was no match for the winner.
HAL'S BUDDY sat just off of the pace while three wide, advanced position along the turn but tired in the stretch. CRIMSON CLOUD settled toward the back
of the field early, was two wide along the turn and had no late response. MUSIC BABE was three wide on the first turn while sitting just off of the pace, went
five wide on the second turn, lost position coming into the stretch and had no late rally.

had to take up just before the drive, found running room in the stretch and kicked clear in the final stages. ON ICE stalked the early fractions while saving
ground along the backstretch and second turn, took command entering the stretch but was not able to hold off ROBBER BARON while still second best.

response. WILD WAGER settled early, traveled in the two path down the backstretch and into the second turn, and finished evenly. GOLD N GRAND

Footnotes
BOLD ROMAN assumed control of the early pace, settled on the lead while in the two path along the turn, was roused a bit in the stretch and kicked clear
for the win. PORTANDO maintained a ground saving trip in the early stages and through the turn, gained position through the stretch and made a late bid
along the rail but was not catching the winner. KATZUMOTO was up close to the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was fanned four wide in the
turn, and was just nosed out late by PORTANDO for second. GOBSMACK sat just off of the early pace while four wide down the backstretch, was fanned
five wide in the turn, gained position though the stretch but was outfinished. IMPLICITLY settled off of the pace while two wide in the early going, gained
position around the turn but had no response in the late stages. IRISH SWING was unhurried early, maintaining a two wide trip at the rear of the field,
passed a tiring rival around the turn to go three wide into the stretch but was outrun in the late stages. THUNDER BOAT was unhurried early, settled at the
back of the field while maintaining a two wide trip and faded after a half-mile.
