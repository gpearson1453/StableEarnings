ITSNOTMYJOB went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and proved much the best. DEJOKE'S SONG pressed the pace, saved ground, proved no
match for the winner, but was best of others. STARBUCK LUCK showed early speed, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two.
MATT'S PRIDE void of early speed, improved position, but was no factor. SOPHISTICATED GIRL raced within contention in the beginning, lacked a bid and
put forth an even effort. PERFECT JUSTICE void of early speed, finished wide and was no threat. MISS UNDERRATED raced within striking distance,
saved ground around the turn and dropped back.

LIMITLESS MAZIE vied for the early lead, drove clear around the second turn, pulled away and proved much the best today. SEVEN COME ELEVEN was
fractious in the gates, raced in the rear in the beginning, made a steady gain, came around the final turn on the outside, entered the stretch seven wide,
proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. TRIBUTE GALAXY challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the second turn and got
caught late for second. TOSHITA FOREVER raced in the middle of the pack, came around the second turn on the outside, made a mild bid and hung.
CABEZA DE TORTUGA broke out, raced near the middle of the field and was no threat late. MADELYN'S MOMENT pressed the pace, raced outside
around the first turn and faded. OVERLY SWEET void of early speed and was never a threat. BEAR TOOTH PASS raced within contention, saved ground
and dropped back. RED REBEL STAR lacked early speed and showed little.

SABER CUT raced within contention, saved ground around the final turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied and drove clear. THE COMPLETE COURT
dueled for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, couldn't match strides with the winner, but was a clear second. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS raced within
striking distance, came around the last turn on the outside, made a wide bid and was clearly third. MY SISTER ANNETTE dueled on the front end, saved
ground and weakened. RUN NOW ESTELLA raced within contention, came around the first turn on the outside and faded. BIRDIE CALL void of early speed
and was never a threat. COMMERCIAL FLASH always raced near the back and showed little. RUNPEGGYRUN lacked early speed and was outrun.

Footnotes
CHEROKEETIN XPRESS pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn, made a bid, four wide and got up in time. VALID BREAK dueled for the early
lead, took the advantage, but was outfinished late for the win. CRAPAUD raced within striking distance, made a late rail bid and proved no match for the top
two. PRICEY challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, was forwardly placed throughout and lacked a finish. SHE CAUSED IT raced
within contention and faded. LANDWOMAN'S GIFT lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor. HILLHIDOLLARYANKEE
void of early speed, raced outside around the turn and was never a threat. MY PAL CHARLENE broke a step slow, raced in the back and showed little.
LAUREL'S CRICKET raced near the back, came around the turn wide and was outrun.
