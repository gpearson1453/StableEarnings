LADY ABIGAIL was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and held that advantage to the wire. EURO
STEP raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. DIAMOND LEGACY
chased the winner while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. RARE POPPY lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn
and finished evenly late. GP'S AMAZING GRACE was void of early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. FINAL DESIGN pressed the
pace of the winner while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

KEEPING SECRETS raced four-wide through both turns while being unhurried early, responded when set down for the drive and wore RIVER CHARMER
down in the closing yards. RIVER CHARMER pressed the pace of GOSPEL GINA while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run but could not resist the winner late. GOSPEL GINA was away in good order to set a
pressured pace from off the rail and gave way after going seven furlongs. J LOVE was forwardly placed early, moved up from the inside to offer a bid
nearing the three-eighths marker and gave way soon after. SWIFT JUSTICE lagged throughout.

deep stretch and edged away late. JOLLY JUMPER sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, responded when challenged
by the winner into the lane, vied and gave way grudgingly late. GLIMPSE OF GLORY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further
nearing the three-sixteenths marker and finished with a late bid. ZIP TIE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the
needed closing response. EURO SUPRISE was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and again with a furlong to
run and did not offer a bid. YOU'REOBADBOY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. SANDMAN'S
LEGACY showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and did not menace.

ARCHRIVAL was allowed to settle early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached MAYFAIR HEIGHTS with a sixteenth to run and edged away
from that rival through the closing yards. MAYFAIR HEIGHTS set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and gave
way grudgingly to the winner late. STACCATO raced four-wide through the first turn, pulled to contend, pressed the pace of MAYFAIR HEIGHTS while
racing four-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. CLIFTON PARK settled off the leaders from between foes and failed to rally. HOODOO BROWN
was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and did not offer a bid.

CRYSTAL CODE was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and drew off through the lane as a handy
winner with little need of urging. MS. WILD ARGUMENT showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with late energy to gain the
place. DOWNEASTER ALEXA was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. AMERICAN PAYDAY
checked soon after the start, pressed the pace from the inside for a half and weakened. WATERMELON KIZS stumbled soon after the start and unseated
his rider.

PUSSYCAT PUSSYCAT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and edged away
late. MYSTERY STAR was away in good order to chase the pace of PINK PHLOX while racing three-wide, stayed on well in the drive and finished with
good courage. PINK PHLOX was off a step slow, rushed to the lead, opened a clear margin before going a quarter, raced off the rail while setting the pace
and gave way through the final yards. PRAIRIE STAR raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and
finished evenly late. SAVE THE DAY showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. CHEROKEE ROSE was up close early,
saved ground and weakened. ONE RING was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ROOMANTICS CHA CHA was off
slow, checked and lagged throughout.

Footnotes
CASH KITTEN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run, moved between rivals in the final yards and got up.
PROUD MOMENTS was allowed to settle early, moved six-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, rallied late and just missed. MUTINEER
stalked the pace of BURTNJOE while racing four-wide, reached the fore inside the sixteenth pole but could not resist the closers late. BURTNJOE broke
sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin into the stretch, drifted in and gave way through the final yards. TOTALLY TIGER
settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. POP CULTURE settled off the leaders early, moved up five-wide to
offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenth pole and gave way in the drive. ONE SON OF A CHIEF pressed the pace from between foes, moved three-wide
through the turn and weakened. CONSUMERCONFIDENCE was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. AWESOME K P lacked early foot, saved ground and did not reach contention.
