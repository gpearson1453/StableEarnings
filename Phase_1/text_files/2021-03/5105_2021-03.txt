Footnotes
VALIANT LADY led the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held of a rival while drifting out mildly
under a drive. TROPHY BRIDLE settled in in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path nearing the three eighths
pole, entered the stretch in the four path and chased the winner home on the outside, the best of the rest. TINDERELLA pressed the pace on the outside in
the early going, navigated the turn from the two and three path, and folded entering the stretch. LADY EXPRESS trailed the field on the outside through the
opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn and gained ground late on the rail in the stretch, but was no match for the top two. WAY
TOO SMARTE trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and offered no bid. TOUR ON raced off the pace in
the opening stages, saved ground around the turn, began to drop back entering the stretch and continued to tire from there. DUE TO A TIMER ERROR
THERE IS NO TIME FOR THE FIVE EIGHTHS.

Footnotes
RUBY ROUND HERE broke very sharply, set the pace down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was confronted by PROMISES KEPT to her
outside near the five sixteenths, shook her off when asked into the lane, and held sway. PROMISES KEPT was nudged early to track the pace outside
horses, bid in the three path past the three eighths, loomed into upper stretch but was turned back past the quarter pole, continued to give dogged chase
while driven in the five path, but could not reel the leader in. HENRYS GIRL chased midpack early, raced three wide into the turn, was pushed along in the
four path in range on the bend, went to a drive six wide in upper stretch, lacked the needed kick to catch the top two but kept on willingly to hold the show
while drifting in late. I SAW HER FIRST was held up in the rear pair early, raced in the two path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, and rallied
mildly between horses. IRISH HALO leapt at the start, raced at the outside of the rear pair early, inched forward approaching the half, chased in the four to
five path on the turn, was driven between horses in upper stretch, but ran only evenly. STOLEN GLANCE chased midpack early, was wrangled back to the
rear pair from the five eighths, raced in the four path with the rear pair around the bend, was driven into the lane in the seven path, but only passed tiring
horses. DULCE MARIA tracked the early pace inside, was relegated to midpack from near the half mile mark, saved ground through the turn, was driven
into the lane, and continued to weaken inside. EMILY BUG tracked the pace between horses early, began to lose position from near the nine sixteenths,
chased in the three to four path between horses on the turn, and proved empty in the lane.

ROAD GAME hopped up leaving the gate, recovered to duel between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, kicked clear
entering the stretch and held off a late closer under a drive. HIGH HERO chased the frontrunners in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground
around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground in late stretch on the outside. GREELEYS ICE trailed the field up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid entering the stretch and improved position on the rail from there. WILLOW RIDGE hit the gate
leaving it, raced outside off the pace early, navigated the turn from the three path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. RIPE ATTACK dueled on the
outside up the backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch in the three path and gave way between horses in the final furlong. SEANSHINE was
away from the gate sharply, dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and tired.

Footnotes
FIRST SQUADRON tracked the leader inside of SAY CHEESE, raced in the pocket on the turn, rallied when driven inside into the lane, took the lead in
upper stretch, and held sway driving. LADY MAGNA broke inward and herded MISS LEARJET inward along with her, settled toward the rear, was pushed
along to improve in the three path on the turn, came into the lane three wide, sustained a rally, and got up for place while drifting out. SAY CHEESE tracked
the leader outside of FIRST SQUADRON, encroached outside of the pacesetter in the three path from the seven sixteenths, headed her past the five
sixteenths, raced three wide into the lane while coming in slightly, could not hold off the inside rally of FIRST SQUADRON, chased on with continued
interest but lost the place late. I JUANA HERO broke outward, was hustled to the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, took pressure from SAY
CHEESE from near the seven sixteenths, was headed by that foe past the five sixteenths, was in a bit tight between horses into the lane, kept on under a
drive until flattening in the final sixteenth. SEVEN SEVENTEEN broke out and bumped TRUE TO JEANINE, chased inside of MISS LEARJET early, saved
ground midpack through the turn, was driven inside into the stretch, and kept on up the inside while lacking the needed kick to threaten the leaders. LA
NEGRA NOCHE settled near the rear, raced in the four path on the turn, was driven in the five to six path in upper stretch, and lacked the needed rally.
TRUE TO JEANINE was reluctant to load, was bumped in the opening strides by SEVEN SEVENTEEN and then by MISS LEARJET, took back to the rear,
trailed in the four path on the turn, was driven in the six path in upper stretch, but lacked the needed rally. MISS LEARJET was herded in during the opening
strides and bumped TRUE TO JEANINE, chased outside of SEVEN SEVENTEEN, continued well behind the leading trio two wide on the turn, raced
between horses into the lane, and faded.

PADDY'S HOUSE was bumped by the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled in to chase the leaders on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn, ran into traffic and was forced to check near the five sixteenths pole, raced into tight quarters once more while launching a bid
approaching the eighth pole, found room and improved position quickly in the final furlong to get clear. MKAR THE FAST reared up in the gate, broke well,
settled between horses at the back of the pack early, raced in the two path around the turn, began to gain ground in midstretch, found racing room and
continued to improve to just get up for second in the final strides. KING'S STORY veered out and bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate,
recovered to lead the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, and raced gamely down the lane, drifting out
in the final furlong and getting caught late. BILLY NOT WILLIAM stalked the leaders between horses early, saved ground around the turn, began his bid with
a quarter to go and flattened out in the final strides. MARESONOFAGUN broke slowly, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to move up from the three
path around the turn, and was outkicked down the lane, though was forced out and bumped mildly with ONE PUTT RICHIE late. ONE PUTT RICHIE
pressed the pace on the outside early, raced in the three path around the turn, challenged between horses in upper stretch, was forced out and bumped
with MARESONOFAGUN in the final strides and weakened late. MOMMAS BOY OTIS stalked the leader between horses early, saved ground around the
turn, entered the stretch in the two path, and flattened out in the final furlong. Half and five furlong times omitted pending review.

SAND MOUNTAIN was keen to take the lead, set the pace in the two to three path on the turn, came into the lane two wide, and held safe under a drive.
TODDLES raced keenly while tracking the pacesetter early, continued to track the pace in the three to four path on the turn, came three wide into the lane,
could not reel in the pacesetter but continued his pursuit evenly under a drive. COCO BRAVADO broke outward, chased three deep down the backstretch
and in the four path on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch, and rallied belatedly while drifting out. DAY IN THE COUNTRY broke inward and hit the
gate, settled at the rear, was urged for an inside bid on the turn and improved to midpack, went to a drive inside into the lane, and weakened in the final
furlong. VENETIAN DREAM was anxious in the gate, chased between horses down the backstretch, continued to chase between horses in the two to three
path into the turn, weakened from the three eighths, had no response under a drive in upper stretch and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
MACHO CLASSIC attended the pace outside of CHEYENNE VIHO, vied outside him in the four path from the seven sixteenths, continued to dispute the
pace under a drive past midstretch, cleared off approaching the sixteenth and held safe. CLEVER BOY broke inward, settled at the rear inside, was patient
to the three eighths, tipped out to the four path and began to rally, was taken inside in upper stretch, continued to improve under a drive, went two wide past
the furlong mark to get around a tiring horse, and got up for the place. ROCKET RIDE settled near the rear, was pushed along into the turn and began to
improve in the four path around the bend, rallied under a drive five wide in the lane and got up for show late. CHEYENNE VIHO was bumped by SARACEN
in the opening strides, was hard sent to the lead, set a pressured pace, vied inside of MACHO CLASSIC from the seven sixteenths, continued to vie inside
him until weakening inside past the furlong mark. WAR TRAIL raced at the inside of the tracking flight early, continued keenly while saving ground in the
pocket on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, chased two wide between horses past midstretch, and flattened out late. SARACEN broke outward and
bumped CHEYENNE VIHO in the opening strides, raced three wide in the tracking flight early, tracked the pace between horses in the three path on the
turn, came into the lane three wide, kept on in range past the furlong mark and weakened late. STRATUS STORM settled at the outside of the rear pair
early, continued at the rear in the five path on the turn, raced between horses in upper stretch, but only passed tiring horses. BOOGY SOKS was urged
early but only got position near the rear, was asked for more three wide into the turn, chased four deep in the six path past the three eights, was driven six
wide into upper stretch and emptied out. DISTINCT THUNDER was fractious in the gate, raced between horses in the tracking flight early, began to lose
position from the half mile mark, weakened in the three path on the turn, and continued to fade inside in the lane.
