was up in time. HONOR STRIKE set a pressured early pace, raced along the inside into the home turn, couldn't hold off the winner drifted in and finished
second best. BARELYSTILLCOUNTS was void of speed, raced along the inside into the home turn, angled out through the stretch, was closing late and
needed more ground. FAST GALLITO broke out at the start, was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside into the home turn and offered no late rally.
HOLY CROSS raced in mid pack early, angled out six wide out of the turn, drifted out late and offered no rally. BOLD COWBOY pressed the early pace,
went three wide into the second turn and weakened. SQUARED STRAIGHT was squeezed at the start, was outrun early, went eight wide through both turns
and flattened out late. DEVILS WORKSHOP tracked the early pace, went five wide into the second turn and was empty. KEATON was taken back and was
no factor. THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED NUMBER ONE FAST GALLITO AND PLACED HIM SEVENTH FOR INTERFERANCE AT THE START.
