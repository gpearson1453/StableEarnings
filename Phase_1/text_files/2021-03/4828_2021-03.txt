Footnotes
ISLE BE GABBY set a pressured early pace, went four wide through both turns, opened up in early stretch, drifted out and held. LOOKIN' SWEET was
outrun early, raced three wide into the second turn, angled out six wide out of the turn, was gaining late, drifted out late and finished second best. SWEET
RYAN raced in mid pack early, went six wide through the second turn and was even late. BIG ENOUGH was allowed to settle early, saved ground into the
home turn and finished belatedly. CEDE'S DREAM was unhurried early, raced off the rail into the home turn, angled out and never fired. ABRAAJEENA was
void of speed, angled out seven wide out of the turn and offered no late rally. LADY SUZZETT tracked the early pace, raced eight wide into the second turn
and was no factor. CAT IN THE PULPIT pressed the early pace, went five wide through the second turn and faded. The seven furlong fractional time was
