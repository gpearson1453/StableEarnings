Footnotes
DOMINATOR, urged to gain a position outside a rival in second flight racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady three wide advance to challenge for
command nearing upper stretch and drove clear. ELUSIVE ROAD broke slowly, angled inwards racing into the first turn, steadily gained position inside foes
through the second bend, switched out three deep entering upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to edge a rival for the place honors.
MAN OF MEN, urged to a forward placing tracking just off the leader in the opening stages, angled to the rail nearing the far turn, bid for command midway
through the second bend to gain a brief advantage but failed to sustain that momentum. BELLAMY'S TREASURE, off slowly, was settled between foes in
the last flight early, shifted out five wide racing into the lane but passed only tiring foes. CUP GAME tracked off the second flight between foes to the
backstretch but lacked a closing response. UPRISE, urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, set the pace on a clear margin to
the far turn and gave out nearing upper stretch. MONROES DREAM settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and dropped back early. CLEAR
WONDER was a brief factor between foes but retreated after a half.

Footnotes
PROBABLY GRACE, settled between foes in the last flight while dropping out last after the opening furlong, steadily gained momentum splitting foes while
shifting out five wide nearing upper stretch and produced a steady late response to wear down the leaders in time under firm encouragement. HEATHER
HILLS, urged between foes from the outset pressing the pace into the turn, dueled for command inside a rival to late stages and was collared by the winner
while prevailing for the place honors. NOTHINS FREE joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival past midstretch
but was outfinished by the top pair. R KISS EM GOODBYE settled inside foes in early stages, dropped out last entering the turn, angled out six wide in
upper stretch and found her best stride late to close the gap on the leaders. MAST COVE tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn and faded
into upper stretch. MARCHING IN, urged inside foes disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. SAY ADIOS
tracked off the first flight inside foes racing to the turn and faded in late stages. TALE OF V K tracked outside rivals in second flight, was fanned six wide
nearing upper stretch and soon retreated.

Footnotes
YES SIR ROBERT switched outside early tracking off the first flight racing to the turn, made steady progress four wide racing into the turn to challenge for
command in upper stretch and edged clear late under firm encouragement. ALABAMA SLAMMER, bumped at the start, was quickly righted, then prompted
between foes to press the pace between foes into the turn, was eased out while dropping off the leaders nearing upper stretch, then shifted outside the
winner entering the lane while producing a solid second effort to prevail for the place honors. R GOODTIME CHARLIE, urged inside foes disputing the pace
racing through the backstretch into the turn, continued grudgingly inside rivals to late stages while finishing on even terms with a rival for a share.
WALLYPOP broke in, bumping ALABAMA SLAMMER, was righted to join the the pace three wide racing through the backstretch, edged clear midway
through the turn but failed to sustain that momentum while finishing on even terms for a share. MARKET angled inwards tracking off the first flight racing to
the turn, shifted out five wide entering upper stretch but had no rally. FRANKIE Z, slow to gather stride, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PEACEFUL WAY, bumped at the start, was quickly righted, then urged inside a rival disputing the pace, shook clear nearing the turn, held sway on a
comfortable margin to the stretch and was kept to firm encouragement to maintain the advantage. LOVIELEE broke sharply, forced the pace outside the
eventual winner racing to the turn, continued in pursuit of that foe through the turn to late stages but proved only second best. ROMANTICAL NOTE ducked
out at the start bumping BONSAI BENNY, was collected off that foe while dropping off the second flight, then split rivals just off the inside racing into the
stretch to improve her position to the end. J'S SILKY tracked off the first flight four wide, then three wide racing into the turn but lacked the needed closing
bid. OUR GIRL ducked inwards bumping the eventual winner at the start, settled off the second flight along the inside early but lacked a rally.
SOPHISTICURL tracked off the second flight three wide between foes in the opening stages but dropped back early while angling inside. BONSAI BENNY,
forced out at the start, was settled last racing to the turn and failed to menace. LADY JEAN came through tight quarters at the start, angled to the inside
pursuing the leaders in second flight racing into the turn and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
BIG VENEZUELA was urged to the lead while angling to the inside leaving the chute dictating the pace on a narrow margin, shook clear racing into the far
turn, held sway on a comfortable advantage past midstretch and just held the late challenge of LOWCOUNTRY under firm encouragement. The latter was
rated off the second flight between foes in the opening half, came around a tiring foe to advance inside foes nearing upper stretch and steadily closed the
gap on the winner to the end. DELFT BLUE settled between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out five wide racing through the far turn while being
prompted to advance and continued to improve position to the end while prevailing for a share. SMILES OF JOY angled inwards to track just off the
pacesetter between foes in second flight, briefly prompted the eventual winner midway through the backstretch but steadily faded nearing upper stretch.
THE WILD FLYER tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance after a half while caught four wide between
foes racing through the far turn and had no closing response. REINER, pulling a bit against rating along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter to the
backstretch, steadily faded racing into the far turn. DEVILISH TAIL settled near the inside racing to the backstretch and never mounted a serious challenge.
GIOVANE'S PROMISE broke inwards bumping SMILE OF JOY, was prompted to gain a forward placing three deep racing to the backstretch but gave way
nearing the lane. KINDLY settled in the last flight along the inside in early stages and never menaced thereafter. VILLAGE PREACHER was settled outside
a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch but proved no factor.

Footnotes
KITTEN'S SPA was settled outside foes in the last flight in the opening mile, was prompted to advance four wide through the third bend to upper stretch and
produced a sustained response to wrest a clear advantage in time under firm handling. JEGOS FIRE, rank while pulling between rivals in the opening
stages, took over after the opening half, held sway a bit off the rail racing through the third bend to upper stretch but proved no match while confronted by
the winner. SHENDAM (FR) tracked the leaders between foes in second flight in the opening mile, was urged to bid between foes into the lane but had no
final kick. TOSS, checked avoiding close quarters along the rail in the opening quarter, continued under rating along the inside to the second bend, swung
out five wide with three furlongs to go and continued to make a mild gain. ANDREZ CONQUIST tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening
mile but offered no rally. TONY SMALL tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the third turn and came up empty nearing upper stretch. DOVER
CLIFFS sped to the fore along the inside, ceded the lead after the opening half while continuing in pursuit of the pacesetter along the rail to the third bend
but gave out into the lane. LAST PROMISE tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening mile and steadily faded entering the third turn.

Footnotes
JEOPARDY JAMES was rated just off the leaders a bit off the rail in the opening stages, steadily gained terms with the pacesetter between foes entering
the turn, disputed the issue in a prolonged drive through the turn past midstretch and narrowly prevailed under firm encouragement. PUDDING tracked the
pacesetter outside foes in the opening stages, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner three deep entering the turn to force the issue, continued in a
protracted skirmish to late stages but was just outfinished. CREA'S BKLYN LAW settled last racing to the turn, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch
and produced a steady late response to gain position while earning a share. FLORIDA TWO STEP was urged to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage
along the rail in the opening stages, continued in pursuit of the leaders on the turn but faded in late stages. SUN SQUALL settled off the second flight racing
to the turn but offered no rally. ELGAR tracked just off the first flight inside foes in early stages but steadily faded into upper stretch. TIZ APPROVED angled
inwards briefly contesting the pace, shifted out four wide while conceding the lead after the opening quarter and soon gave way.

Footnotes
ANTALYA, reserved last near the inside for the opening seven furlongs, switched out nearing the third bend, circled foes on that turn, swung out four wide in
upper stretch and produced a stout rally under firm handling to take over leaving the sixteenth marker, then was taken in hand approaching the wire.
BLOODY MARY MORNIN switched a bit off the inside in the opening stages to stalk just outside the pacesetter under light rating in the opening half, was
prompted to close the gap on that foe nearing upper stretch, continued to dispute the issue three deep through the lane and edged a rival for second late
while failing to match the winner. BELLA PIERINA sped to the lead while angling over, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin along the inside to the
third turn, shifted out while being roused to resist a challenger racing past midstretch but yielded to the top pair late. WONDER BLONDY, away a step
slowly, was rated off the second flight along the inside, gained some position inside foes when presented an opening leaving the second bend, saved
ground to upper stretch to challenge inside the leaders nearing the furlong marker but lacked the needed final kick. CLASSY OF COURSE tracked off the
first flight along the inside for the opening six furlongs, shifted out leaving the second turn and continued evenly between foes to late stages. MAJESTIC
QUEEN tracked off the second flight outside rivals racing to the third turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. UNABRIDGED (IRE) settled outside foes in
the last flight in the opening mile and offered no rally. WRITTEN IN RED settled between foes in the last flight and dropped out early.

Footnotes
OPTIMISTIC VALOR angled inwards gaining a position off the first flight stalking those foes under light reserve, shifted inside nearing the far turn
maintaining striking distance, shifted out nearing upper stretch to advance three deep on the leaders in tandem with HELLFIRE BOB, then came under firm
left handed pressure to kick clear leaving midstretch to prove best HELLFIRE BOB, held up between foes just off the second flight racing to the backstretch,
switched out nearing the far turn while being prompted to advance, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch advancing in tandem with the eventual
winner to challenge for command but proved only second best. HE HAD A SECRET shifted in leaving the chute while moving to terms prompting the
pacesetter to the backstretch, pressed the issue outside that foe through the far turn to upper stretch and kept on for a share late while failing to contain the
top pair. BIG TALL DAWG, roused to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, disputed the pace inside a rival through the far turn to upper stretch
and weakened late. IT'S MANDATORY settled while angling nearer the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing through the far turn
and gained some position in an even effort. TOP BOMB settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide entering the
lane to gain some position but made no real impression. FEISTY KITTEN exchanged bumps with SECERT MAGICIAN in the opening stages, settled
outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. COUSIN switched off the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch but faded
early. IRISH MAIL tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch and retreated early. SECRET MAGICIAN exchanged bumps at the start,
angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight to the backstretch but emptied out after a half.
