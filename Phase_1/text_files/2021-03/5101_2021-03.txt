on the leader late on the backstretch, ranged up two to three wide on the far turn, took over outside the quarter-pole, was put to the crop in upper stretch,
braced for the challenge of the runner-up into the final sixteenth, dug in gamely in the final strides and narrowly prevailed. SHAKE SOME ACTION went four
then five wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, rounded the far turn in the four path, dropped in while put to a drive in upper stretch, moved out while
rallying behind the winner into the final furlong, gained on that foe into the final sixteenth, drew alongside late but was denied while clear for the place.
TAKAFUMI (BRZ) bumped with a rival at the start, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, went around the far turn in the two path,
was carried inward in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. THE GREEN MO'STER bumped with a rival at the start, went
three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused while three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed response. JURISDICTION went three wide on the first turn, drifted out near the five-eighths pole, settled towards the front, moved closer in the three
path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. CHANTRY FLATS went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused
five wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LOOKIN HIGH went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the
rear, saved ground on the far turn, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond. DREAMING OF CARATS sped clear early, drew off
to a sizable lead on the inside, saw the advantage diminish late on the backstretch, shortened stride on the far turn, was collared inside the five-sixteenths
and faded. (Rail at 10 Feet)

forced strongly into another foe, raced in the three path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, lugged out leaving the backstretch, came up empty
in the four path on the far turn and faltered. (Rail at 10 Feet)

Footnotes
SOUTHERN LIGHT settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, moved out while gaining in upper stretch then made a bid, dueled with the runner-up in
the final furlong and gamely prevailed under strong urging. OUR LAST SHOT bumped with a rival at the start, settled well off the pace, went four wide on
the turn, gained five wide into the stretch then came between horses before making a bid around the three-sixteenths, dueled outside of the winner in the
final furlong and was denied while able to get the place. P T'S FLASH lacked early speed from the outside, went two to three wide on the turn, came four
wide into the stretch, moved out near the three-sixteenths, dropped in while gaining at the furlong marker, moved further in while closing fast into the final
sixteenth and finished with good energy for the show. MR. OLD HAT broke out and bumped with a foe, settled on the far outside, was urged five wide on the
turn, came seven wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CAJUN NAVY was eased back off the pace then well placed behind the leading
duo, chased in the five path on the turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, drifted in while in front near the three-sixteenths then lost the advantage,
dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. PERMANENTDETENTION settled off the pace, moved closer in the two path on the turn, was asked for
his best in upper stretch and also lacked the needed response. PRIMEINTERESTRATE set the pace under pressure to his outside, came out leaving the
backstretch, vied three then two wide on the turn, lost the lead outside the three-sixteenths and tired. WAR ROGUE tossed his head at the start, raced in the
front half of the field, was urged five wide on the turn then was carried six wide into the stretch and had nothing left. BITSY'S OTHER HALF broke out a bit
at the start, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. SWEET LEVI was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths,
saved ground on the turn and was no factor. HEZA FORTUNE pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the four path on the turn and faded. SADIE'S
GROOM leaned in at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, went around the turn in the two path and trailed.

Footnotes
UNRESTRICTED went to the front, set the pace on the inside, extended the advantage under his own power on the far turn, responded well when asked at
the three-sixteenths and drew off while kept to the task. LIKE MIKE stumbled at the start and bumped with a rival, went around the first turn in the two path,
was rated just off the pace, chased two to three wide on the far turn, pursued the winner into upper stretch and proved no match while able to get the place.
PAYDAY TOO went five wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, came under urging while three to four wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. MUCH CLASS settled on the inside, saved ground through the far turn and failed
to rally. POWER JET bumped with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged four to five wide on the far turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and also lacked the needed response. CABO'S RUMOR went four wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace,
checked very badly to avoid an injured rival midway down the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and lost all chance. FREEDOMFI rounded the first
turn in the two path, settled at the rear, checked severely midway down the backstretch to avoid the injured rival and also lost any chance. MAKE ME SMILE
traveled around the first turn in the four path, stalked the pace on the outside, went wrong passing the nine-sixteenths and was pulled up then vanned off.

Footnotes
ORETTA pressed the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader in the three path early on the turn, shook clear under the crop while four wide into the
stretch, extended the advantage under a drive into the final furlong and proved much the best under steady urging. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA settled off the
pace, raced inside early on the turn, shifted three wide nearing the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch and safely secured the place. BLONDIE
LOX BABE set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole, dropped back into upper stretch
then moved out behind the winner and tired while clear for the show. GRACE FOREVER was off a couple of lengths slow, saved ground at the rear of the
field, swung seven wide into the stretch and improved position without threatening. SPEAK TO ME was coaxed along on the outside, chased four wide on
the turn and came up empty. ROCKIN SUNDAY showed speed then chased the pace, went around the turn in the two path and also came up empty.
DANCE AWAY settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, steadied briefly when MAW MAW'S SOPHIA came out inside the three-eighths, was driven
four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. BALOOK raced well back in the field, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was
no factor. ACTIVE GIRL broke a step slow, raced towards the rear of the field, went three wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to respond.
MANDOLINE STAR settled off the pace, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and also failed to respond. RONNIE'S PESO settled
towards the back, was taken in hand near the half-mile pole, dropped back while moving out leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, came five
wide into the stretch then moved out and had nothing left.

Footnotes
CEES GET DEGREES disputed the pace on the outside, vied three then two wide on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, dueled outside of the
runner-up in the stretch and gamely prevailed under strong urging. SILK TRADE showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along
the rail on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, dueled inside of the winner in the stretch and missed while narrowly able to get the place. PRAIRIE
settled off the pace, went four wide on the turn, shifted six wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside and finished fast to just miss the place but earned the
show. CLARESTOWN was well placed while rated just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was asked in the two path just after turning into the stretch,
chased into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and finished with good courage but missed the trifecta. KOUFAX hit the outside of the gate at the
start then brushed with a foe, stalked the leading duo on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, dropped back
under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked. AMERICAREDWHITEBLU broke in at the start, was reserved off the pace, raced under tight restraint
outside the seven-sixteenths, was let out some in the two path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. FILIPPO was
rated on the far outside, went five wide on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and weakened. THIRTY SEVEN was bumped at the start and forced
in badly, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. SAMYAZA was off slow, went three to four wide on the turn and was no factor.
PHAROAHSWHEEL veered in at the start, settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. (Rail at 10
