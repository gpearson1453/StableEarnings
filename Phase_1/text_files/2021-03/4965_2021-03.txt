Footnotes
SENSEMAKER vied for the lead early then cleared around the turn, set all the pace to the stretch, responded when challenged from outside and held
gamely under right-handed urging. PLAY CHICKEN broke in and bumped rival, vied between rivals early then outside SENSEMAKER, dropped back to
stalk that rival around the first turn, bid outside in the stretch but could not summon the needed late kick. GOLDINI showed early speed three deep then let
the top pair go to the front, angled to the rail around the first turn, waited for room two wide exiting the far turn, shifted to the inside in upper stretch and
lacked room along the fence through the final furlong. SWIFT AS I AM sandwiched between rivals at the start, reserved in the early stages near the inside,
saved ground into the lane, was impeded by GOLDINI and forced to check in upper stretch, moved off the rail and finished late energy. MY SUMMER
DREAM showed brief speed outside a trio of rivals then dropped back and angled from four wide down to the two path on the first turn, tracked outside a
rival then came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. MR. PICKLES broke out and bumped rival at the start, trailed the field early while under a hold,
traveled off the inside, three then four wide on the far turn and weakened. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED GOLDINI FROM
THIRD TO FOURTH FOR CROSSING OVER WITHOUT SUFFICIENT CLEARANCE AND IMPEDING SWIFT AS I AM IN UPPER STRETCH, COSTING
SWIFT AS I AM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

STARSHIP CHEWBACCA away quickest from outside, chased then attended the pace four deep, vied three deep around the turn, dueled outside of the
runner-up in the final furlong and proved best. LUCKYS LAST STAND sped to the front, dueled outside of DANCING IN PARIS then vied between rivals
around the turn, dueled with the winner down the stretch and but had to settle for second best. SHOTGUN RIDER off a bit slow to begin, angled outside
early, chased four then three wide into the lane, drifted to the inside and gained the show. FLY BUDDY FLY chased outside the leader then moved up three
deep, vied between rivals around the turn, lost contact with the top pair in upper stretch, tipped out at the eighth pole and weakened. DANCING IN PARIS
broke in at the start, went up to duel from inside, could not keep pace nearing the turn, dropped back around the bend drifted out in the lane and tired.
STING LIKE A BEE broke awkwardly, chased off the rail, drifted out and checked at the five-sixteenths, exited the bend four wide and had little left.

K P KAN DO chased off the rail, closed in three wide through the turn, took over in upper stretch and kicked clear. SWEETHEART trailed the field early,
entered the bend three wide, exited four wide, rallied and gained the place. VICIOUS VELMA settled outside rivals, traveled four to five wide around the turn
and got outkicked for the place. CONSIDER ME GONE tracked between foes up the backstretch then outside rivals on the turn, came four wide into the
lane, drifted inward and needed more late. AVISSE stalked two wide into the turn, angled to the fence around the bend, moved out and went between rivals
in upper stretch, floated in by CONSIDER ME GONE and weakened. CIRCLE OF HONOR was closest in pursuit early, chased two wide through the turn,
three wide in upper stretch and weakened. PURDA VITA took control from inside, showed the way saving ground around the turn, clung to a short lead into
the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
LULUMARU showed speed from inside then lugged out early, steered back inward and set the pace in the two path through the turn, kicked clear from rival
around the turn, urged right-handed through lane maintaining a clear lead, drifted out late and held safely. ETERNAL ENDEAVOUR (GB) tracked off the
inside, checked off heels when TODOS SANTOS shifted out at the five-sixteenths, split foes then came three wide into the stretch, floated out by the winner
late and finished well for second. MADAME BARBARIAN allowed to settled in the early going, moved inside and saved ground to the stretch, summoned a
mild rally but needed more late. TIZ TOFFEE floated out by the leader early, chased outside a rival then got floated out again at the five-sixteenths, exited
the turn four wide and got bumped into the lane and could not rally. TODOS SANTOS stumbled leaving the gate, sent to press the pace from inside, lost
contact with the leader then shifted out at the five-sixteenths, dropped back around the turn, drifted and bumped outside rival into the stretch and tired.
MAJESTIC DIVA went three wide into the turn, angled in around the bend and was never a factor.

Footnotes
LEGGS GALORE broke quickly from the far outside, cleared and crossed over into the two path, held a comfortable lead through the turn and into the
stretch a bit off the rail, urged right-handed in the lane and won easily. BELLA VITA stalked from inside then a bit off the rail into the drive, failed to threaten
the winner in the late stages but was clearly second best. SADIE BLUEGRASS chased in the two path through the turn, could not summon the needed
response in the final furlong but stayed on to hold the show. NARDINI tracked the pace from inside, saved ground around the turn and missed the show.
PULPIT RIDER off a bit slow to begin, unhurried in the beginning and angled to the two path, found the rail around the turn and trailed the field from inside
to the stretch, moved off the inside and improved position. SAPPHIRE KID stalked outside a rival, two to three wide around the turn and could not rally.
SCARLET HEAT settled outside a rival, entered the stretch three to four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
ANNA FANTASTIC dueled inside of VELLA to the stretch, kicked clear in the lane and drew off. SOFI'S GOLD forwardly placed to the inside of the top pair,
lost ground around the turn and remained inside to the stretch, finished willingly and bested the rest. SHYLOCK EDDIE chased outside a rival then two to
three wide into the stretch, angled out and earned the show. PEACE PIPE trailed the field up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, came out around
the bend and entered the stretch four to five wide, produced a mild rally and filled out the superfecta. BELLA D settled off the pace, went outside rivals on
the turn, exited the bend three wide and failed to threaten. VELLA dueled for the lead from outside to the stretch, drifted out at the top of the lane and lost
contact with the winner, drifted out a bit further and weakened. SWEET RAFAELA stalked the leaders from between rivals to the stretch and could not rally.
PUSHING SIXTY stalked the pace from inside, saved ground into the drive and weakened.
