REAL GOOD DEAL was outrun early, made a six wide middle move into the second turn, took control at the quarter pole and drew off as an easy winner.
MOMS FAVORITE was taken back early, advanced seven wide through the second turn, followed the winner hone, drifted in and finished second best.
SECRETS OF MY SOUL set a pressured early pace, raced three wide into the second turn and weakened. OUR LAST ROSE raced in mid pack early,
raced between rivals into the home turn and faded. SHADOW ME GRAY was void of speed, went six wide into the second turn, angled out and offered no
rally. IMA FINAL DE BUY was up close early from between rivals and tired. SUPAH SISTA stalked the early pace, made a middle move along the
backstretch and was finished early. MISS WINE TOPPER was unhurried early, drifted far wide through the home turn and was no factor. PERFECTUS
pressed the early pace, went eight wide out of the turn and retreated.
