Footnotes
LISTEN LINDA led inside of rival on the backstretch, continued to lead into the turn and shook free from pressing rival early on the turn, continued on well in
the stretch under a strong drive. ROCKETANN tracked leader along the rail on the backstretch, continued saving ground into the turn, angled three wide
midway through the turn to advance three wide on the second half of the turn, entered stretch in the four path and battled gamely to get up for second.
ELECTRIC ELIZABETA stalked pace off the rail on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside, launched bid along the rail in the stretch and dueled with
ROCKETANN for second the final sixteenth and just missed. SHENANDOAH STAR pressed leader two wide on the backstretch, unable to match strides
with leader on the turn, lacked needed response in the lane and finished a weakening fourth. THICK SMOKE lacked speed and failed to threatened.
