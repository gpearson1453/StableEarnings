Footnotes
PALM D'ORO stalked the early pace from a ground saving two wide trip around the turn, passed NIP NAP heading into the final furlong and dug in to fend
off a rallying STAND IN YOUR LOVE to get the win. STAND IN YOUR LOVE was unhurried early, advanced position while four wide along the turn, made a
sustained rally in the stretch to pressure PALM D' ORO but couldn't get past that rival late. HOLY CATHOLIC sat midpack through the early stages, had to
check entering the turn, was two wide coming off of the turn and was outfinished in the stretch. NIP NAP was away alertly, setting fractions from the two
path, continued to save ground off the turn but tired in the drive. AUTUMN ISABELLA settled midflight early, while still close to the leaders, assumed a two
wide trip around the turn, and weakened in the stretch run. LIL INDIAN ANNIE settled toward the rear of the field in the early going, saved ground into the
turn, lost position off of the turn and had no late bid in the stretch.

I AM ALLTHATYOUARE saved ground while setting early fractions, was roused at the head of the lane when confronted by OUR EXPECTATION and
kicked clear in the drive. OUR EXPECTATION settled early, chased the pace from a four wide position along the turn, mounted a sustained run at the head
of the lane but could not get to the leader in the final stages. LOAFERS BOY sat just off of the early pace while saving ground on the turn, was asked for run
at the head of the stretch and was outfinished by the top two. UNUSUAL MISCHIEF was unhurried early, settling at the back of the field while saving ground
two wide, began passing tiring rivals in the stretch and finished evenly. RUNKERRY stalked the early pace while two wide on the turn, was outrun off of the
turn and had no late response in the stretch. HAWK HILL settled midpack early, chasing the pace three wide on the turn, and was empty for the stretch
drive.

CRACK A COLD ONE pressed the early pace while saving ground along the turn, took the lead entering the stretch and held off an oncoming SURPRISE
FASHION for the win. SURPRISE FASHION sat just off of the early pace, saved ground two wide onto the turn, began a sustained rally inside of the eighth
pole and pressured CRACK A COLD ONE late, but was not getting past the winner. LEADVILLE set pace through the early going, saved ground along the
turn, was urged in the stretch but tired in the drive. IRISH SWING was unhurried early, chased the leaders three wide on the turn, and had no late kick in the
stretch. IVORIAN settled midflight early, came four wide along the turn and was not a factor late. PRINCEOFTHENORTH settled toward the back of the
back early while saving ground, was outrun into the turn and was empty for the stretch drive. HARDY CHISEL was up close to the pace early, saved ground
along the turn, began losing position off of the turn and had no late response in the stretch.

not impact that one but was not threatened for second. HEMATITE chased the top two while off the rail to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch, tired
but held thjird. BIG DRESS was outrun to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch but did not offer the needed late response. DIVALICIOUS had no speed,
was forced to circle five wide on the turn and did not rally. KRISTIN'S PICNIC got outrun to the turn, was four then five wide to the stretch and not a factor.

ground to no avail. DIAMONDVILLE chased the leaders from the rail to the stretch then gave way. MISS PEG was outsprinted to the turn and gave way in
