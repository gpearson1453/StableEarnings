VASTLY DEEP dueled outside of rival for lead on the backstretch, continued to duel two wide on the turn and into the stretch, shook free from rival and clear
with a sixteenth to go, held safely while close gained ground late. LEGALLY GRAY pressed leaders along the inside, continued along the rail on the turn
and eased out to bid three wide late in the turn, kept to task in the stretch and gained ground on leader while second best. MR. ESKEN bumped at the start,
tracked leaders along the rail on the backstretch, entered turn along the rail, eased out in the stretch and rallied to pass tiring rival for third. BADGER
bumped at the start, dueled inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, unable to match strides with winner in deep stretch and edged
out for third. HARPER'S GEM hopped at the start, recovered and tracked leaders two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, fanned four wide late
on the turn and lacked need rally while one paced in the stretch. SHANGHAI CURLY lacked speed and fell far back on the backstretch, lacked any
response at any point and coasted in to the finish.
