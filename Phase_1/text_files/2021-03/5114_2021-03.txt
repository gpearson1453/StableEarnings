Footnotes
MIND MELD angled to the inside up the backstretch, saved ground to the lane, tipped off the rail then rallied while drifting out and drew clear in the final
sixteenth. BLAZINGBELLABLU was crowded and checked between rivals early, moved to the inside then two wide leaving the turn, angled out to be widest
in the drive and finished well for the place. BOSSY MAMA was off a bit slow to begin then rushed up to establish the front, cleared and crossed over to the
inside, saved ground through the turn, led clear to the eighth pole and yielded to the top pair. S. S. UNICORN traveled two wide around the turn and passed
tired rivals. JEANNE B chased inside then outside the leader, went two wide into the turn, drifted out past the quarter pole and flattened in the final furlong.
FLAG SALUTE stalked the pace from outside or outside a rival, got floated out leaving the turn, came five wide into the stretch and weakened.

upper stretch, drew alongside the leader at the eighth pole, bumped with that rival mid-stretch and dug in late for the victory. WHATDIDIDO broke in and
bumped rival at the start, dropped back early then moved inside, saved ground into the lane, angled out in upper stretch, drifted out and bumped JUDAS
repeatedly, rallied and got up for second, then pulled up on the gallop out and was vanned off. FERRARIANO sped to the front then angled over to the
inside, remained inside to the stretch, held a short lead with a furlong to go, lost command then drifted out and bumped rival mid-stretch, finished gamely
from inside and got edged for the place. JUDAS jumped the track crossing surfaces early, raced between rivals then outside another foe, angled four wide
into the lane, drifted in upper stretch, got bumped repeatedly by WHATDIDIDO and kept on to the wire. MINISTER SHANE chased from outside then
dropped back to the rear of the field, angled into the two path, came out leaving the turn then altered out into the stretch and could not rally. MARKSMAN

Footnotes
EXULTATION stalked the speed outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch, bumped at the three-sixteenths pole, drifted in at the eighth pole, then
drew clear while drifting in further and held off ARMOUR PLATE in the closing moments. ARMOUR PLATE stalked the pace from inside then tipped out into
the two path leaving the turn, bumped outside rival at the three-sixteenths, bumped with KRIS' WILD KAT while between foes at the eighth pole, switch
outside of EXULTATION after and finished well. HARTEL dueled from inside to the stretch, held a short lead at the eighth pole, succumbed to pressure
inside the furlong grounds and flattened to third. AMERICAN DANCER angled in and settled inside, went between rivals midway around the turn then came
back to the rail leaving the bend, moved out mid-stretch and finished with a mild rally to fill out the superfecta. RAILSPLITTER sat off the pace early, went
two to three wide around the turn and kept on to improve placing. KRIS' WILD KAT dueled outside HARTEL to upper stretch, bumped ARMOUR PLATE at
the eighth pole and weakened. SIGALERT bumped with inside rival at the start, trailed early from inside, went around a rival into the stretch and was never
a factor. SUANCES SECRET bumped with SIGALERT at the start, raced mid-pack up the backstretch, angled to the rail and saved ground to the stretch
and came up empty.

Footnotes
SELF TAUGHT settled off the pace early, entered the turn four wide, steered into the two path around the turn, rallied inside the leader and drew clear late.
CAPTAIN SCOTTY dueled for the lead from outside, cleared rival exiting the turn, led into the final sixteenth and could not hold off the winner. OUTLAW
was forwardly placed off the inside, put in a mild bid outside the top pair into the turn, could not sustain the momentum and chased those rivals three wide
through the bend, finished willingly through the drive and held the show. SATCHEL DE RITCHES tracked outside a rivals while widest of all, took the turn
five wide, churned on through the final furlong but needed more late. CAPTURE THE SEA dueled for the lead from inside, lost contact into the stretch and
flattened near the inside. CAMBY chased between rivals well off the rail, went four wide through the turn and lacked a bid. ENGRAM dropped far back early,
angled to the rail on the turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
AWARD WINNER set the pace under pressure from outside, inched away from rival on the first turn only to be pressured again up the backstretch,
responded when headed approaching the quarter pole, shook free at the top of the lane and drew away. GREGDAR pressed the pace from outside, bid
outside on the final turn and headed rival at the quarter pole, lost touch with the winner at the top of the lane and stayed on to hold the place. SALVATOR
MUNDI unhurried in the beginning from inside, came out on the far turn and four wide into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and earned the show honors.
HEYWOODS BEACH tracked off the rail then between runners, went three wide into the lane and lacked further response. MIND THE GAP stalked the
pace from inside, saved ground then tipped out two wide into the stretch and weakened. BIG BUZZ raced well off the rail into the stretch the first time,
angled in some and settled outside a pair of rivals, moved into the two path around the final turn and weakened.

NOTRE DAME dueled for command from inside, vied two wide inside pair of rivals on the turn, moved clear approaching the eighth pole and lasted over the
late rally from the runner-up. DEFENSE WINS hopped at the start, trailed the field up the backstretch, moved to the inside then swung six wide leaving the
turn, closed fast from outside but was too late. DARK PRINCE was forwardly placed from outside, bid three deep into the turn, vied outside rivals around the
bend and into the stretch and could not match the top pair in the final furlong. I GOT NO MUNNY chased along the inside then angled off the rail, went two
wide into the turn, angled four wide leaving the bend and never produced a bid. HOLDEN THE LUTE chased outside a rival then four deep on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and weakened. PRINCE ALI dueled outside of NOTRE DAME early, vied between rivals around the turn and gave way in the
stretch. MIDNIGHT MYSTERY broke out and bumped GATE SPEED, showed early speed then chased the top pair from inside, saved ground into the lane
and weakened. GATE SPEED bumped from inside in the beginning, tracked off the rail, went between rivals on the turn then angled in leaving the bend and
came up empty.

Footnotes
GOING TO VEGAS vied with MUCHO UNUSUAL early before clearing that rival first time through the stretch, showed the way along the inside into the
drive, then drew off under right-handed urging and strong handling in the final furlong. MUCHO UNUSUAL showed early speed from inside then let GOING
TO VEGAS take control, stalked near the fence to the stretch, could not summon the needed late kick to threaten the winner but bested the rest. RED LARK
(IRE) settled off the pace outside a rival, raced two wide then swung four wide into the stretch and gained the show. NEIGE BLANCHE (FR) was off a bit
slow at the start, stalked in the two path, came out a bit in upper stretch and weakened. ALTEA (FR) came away a bit slow, steered to the inside shortly
after, settled inside and saved ground through the turns, shifted into the two path entering the stretch and could not rally. SILBERPFEIL (IRE) was off a bit
slow to begin, fought the rider down the hill and first time through the stretch, pulled a bit through the clubhouse turn, went two wide around the clubhouse
turn, continued to throw her head past the five-eighths, tipped outside leaving the backstretch, went three wide into the drive, was bothered by rival at the
three-sixteenths pole and faded.
