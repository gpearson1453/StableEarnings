Footnotes
KEITANY stalked the pace inside, angled three wide in upper stretch, split rivals soon after, seized command nearing the sixteenth pole and edged ahead
under left-handed urging. MANUELA was in range two wide, bid outside of the winner in upper stretch, battled on outside of that foe and was outkicked.
METAFORA saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. DORA PRINCELLA was bumped at the start, raced off the pace
tow wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, came widest into the lane and failed to sustain the bid. TIME SENSITIVE pressed the pace two wide, led
in upper stretch and weakened inside through the final furlong. STARSHIP MISHKA was bumped at the start, brushed with DUAPHINE entering the first
turn, raced three wide around that bend, made some progress four wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. TONALA stalked the pace three wide
around the first turn, moved up between rivals early on the backstretch, vied three wide from there to upper stretch, steadied near the three-sixteenths pole
and retreated. JAZZY T set the pace along the rail and gave way near the quarter pole. DAUPHINE was reluctant to load, broke slowly, was brushed
entering the first turn, rushed up four wide while rank, and was through after a half. BELLE ELLE was outrun inside.

DARK TIMBER vied outside GRAND WISER for a half-mile, took over from there and drew away in hand. GRAND WISER dueled inside DARK TIMBER for
a half, was no match into the lane, stayed on his left lead and clearly bested the others. KURT'S A KEEPER broke two lengths slow, raced two wide on the
turn, and did enough to be much best of the remainder. EL ZOPILOTE advanced mildly on the turn two wide, but could not sustain the bid. KLEON was a
length slow at the start, and never got close. DRUM AND DRUMMER showed brief speed, and was finished on the turn. READTHETRANSCRIPT stayed in
range to the end of the turn, and had nothing left.

Footnotes
MIA AT MIDNIGHT saved ground close up to the far turn, shifted out rallying between horses at the top of the stretch, overpowered BLUE KENTUCKY
GIRL from outside and drew off under a drive. BLUE KENTUCKY GIRL prompted the pace outside TAKE ME AS I AM, took over after six furlongs, could
not withstand the winner in upper stretch, and ran on clearly second best. MAGICAL CHARM broke a step slow, raced two to three wide in the second flight
for six furlongs, and rallied mildly to wind up a distant third. LOOK WHAT I FOUND bobbled a couple strides from the gate, put in a brief three-wide bid near
the quarter-pole, but flattened out. AMERICAN CLASSIC raced near the inside on the turns, and failed to factor. CHECK TWICE was outrun inside. TAKE
ME AS I AM cleared inside with the lead soon after the start, got collared after six furlongs and folded up. FIVE K KITTEN was skittish coming onto the track
unseating the rider, hit the left side of the gate at the start coming out behind the field, lost contact with the others soon after, got pulled up entering the
backstretch and walked off.

Footnotes
FINANCIAL SYSTEM stalked the pace three and four wide, reached even terms in upper stretch, dueled outside of GRAN MALBEC through the lane and
prevailed. GRAN MALBEC pressed the pace two wide, took the lead nearing the lane, drifted out into the stretch, dueled inside of the winner through the
lane and just missed in a game try. STATION ROCK settled off the pace while racing two wide and rallied inside of foes to gain the show. APACHE BRAVE
was in range two wide and boxed in for three furlongs, swung widest in upper stretch and had a mild rally. CRYOGENIC was off slow, raced four wide and
never threatened. TENACITY ZIP steadied along inside through the opening quarter, chased inside around the turn and weakened in the lane. REAGAN'S
HEART was outrun inside. BLACK JET set the pace along the rail and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
ANOTHER WOMAN broke alertly and pursued MEET THE BEAUTY from outside, challenged for command between that one and PERFECT GRACE
midway on the turn, outdueled the latter through the furlong grounds and edged away all out. PERFECT GRACE was a bit reluctant to load, came away in
good order tracking from close range, ranged up three wide to join the leaders after a half-mile, battled outside ANOTHER WOMAN through upper stretch,
and was bested through the late stages. ALLWORTHY broke two lengths slow, rallied into third position turning for home, but made no further progress
staying on her left lead. SURREALIST raced close up early inside, and had no response into the stretch. MEET THE BEAUTY dashed clear early, came
under fire from the top two finishers going to the three-eighths, and gave way. VIDA YELLOW was roused early on the turn, and failed to respond.
MARILYN MERLOT lunged at the break and was off two lengths slow, raced widest up the backstretch, and moved in around the turn unable to keep up.

Footnotes
KEEP QUIET (FR) settled off the early pace three wide, made good progress three deep rounding the far turn, reached near even terms in midstretch, vied
outside of DR. SHANE to the wire and won the bob. DR. SHANE stalked the pace two wide, took the lead in upper stretch, dug in gamely inside of the
winner through the final eighth, led until the final stride and lost the head bob. UHTRED steadied early, raced well back two wide early, advanced four wide
around the far turn and was along for the show. TIL THE END raced off the pace three and four wide and improved position in the lane. ROCKET JOE
COPPER lacked early speed while racing four wide, made a strong four wide move around the far turn but failed to sustain in the lane. DREAM FRIEND
prompted the pace three wide and weakened in the final furlong. PROJECTED (GB) rated back to last, trailed inside, swung out nearing the lane and
passed tiring rivals. TRAFFIC PATTERN set the pace along the rail and tired in the drive. ALL GOOD was in range two and three wide between foes and
lacked a rally. CAN'T TRUMP KITTEN failed to menace while racing two wide. APRECIADO saved ground to no avail. DEVOTED KITTEN chased the pace
inside and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
GIROLAMO'S ATTACK broke sharply but was content to stalk three wide to the turn, poked a head in front going confidently outside FLATTER ME past the
quarter-pole, opened up roused through upper stretch, and continued to widen under a mild drive. SCAR bumped with ROMAN EMPIRE at the start,
advanced around the turn three then four wide, could not keep pace with the winner into the lane but ran on clearly second best. SILVERLY ENOUGH
bumped with ROMAN EMPIRE at the start, stayed in range two then three wide to the end of the turn, moved out past the eighth-pole and was along for the
show. FLATTER ME came through on the rail with an early move to the lead, could not hold off GIROLAMO'S ATTACK turning for home and faded steadily.
ROMAN EMPIRE lost his footing at the start and was bounced around between SILVERLY ENOUGH and SCAR, struggled to stay in range to the turn in the
two-path, and came up empty. RALSTON led out of the chute, yielded to FLATTER ME midway up the backstretch, rebid briefly between horses near the
three-eighths, and was done after six furlongs.

Footnotes
PHAT MAN advanced to contention around the turn four wide, took over outside LEXITONIAN a quarter-mile out and drove clear decisively. ENDORSED
broke slowly, recovered to a forward position inside, lacked room from the five-sixteenths to the quarter-pole before moving out, rallied through the furlong
grounds but the winner was long gone by then. SOLDADO stayed close early, shifted out four wide while getting outpaced approaching the stretch, and ran
on well enough to go clear for the show. LEXITONIAN pressed LUDINGTON from outside early, challenged between horses after a half-mile, could not go
with PHAT MAN coming off the turn, and faded steadily. WHERE PARADISE LAY took an awkward first step and steadied off the heels of PHAT MAN, and
moved out four wide tiring after a half. LUDINGTON set a pressured pace inside to midway on the turn, and gave way after relinquishing the lead.

CUESTION DE TIEMPO stalked the pace two wide, slowly gained outside of the pacesetter through the lane, took the lead in deep stretch and just lasted
between foes. STREET COPPER was fractious in the starting gate, tracked the pace two wide, tipped three wide in upper stretch, rallied outside and just
missed. FIG JELLY set the pace along the rail, led to deep stretch and yielded in the late yards. IMPERIAL MISSION settled off the pace along the inside,
checked leaving the half-mile pole, continued to save ground around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and had a mild rally between. PROLIFERATE
went evenly inside. SCANNO failed to menace while racing three and four wide. DUROCHER was in range three wide and faded in the lane. SALUTE THE
COLONEL steadied nearing the first turn, raced well back two wide around that bend, rushed up between foes down the backstretch, checked near the
seven-sixteenths marker, angled four wide into the turn and lacked a rally. NASHTRICK steadied at the start and played no factor while racing two and three
wide.

Footnotes
YOUNG FLINT got sawed off between HE AIN'T NO SAINT and WARP SPEED BABY and checked back at the start, began moving on the far turn while
shifting out four wide, overhauled SWEENEY'S CAT from outside past the furlong marker and drew away hand urged. HE AIN'T NO SAINT bumped with
YOUNG FLINT at the start, saved ground within range for a half-mile, advanced moving off the rail approaching the stretch, finished willingly but was second
best. SWEENEY'S CAT lost his footing at the break but recovered quickly, pressed LIL CROWN from outside, took over near the quarter-pole, proved no
match for the winner a furlong out and weakened. WARP SPEED BABY broke in shying away from ASSERT DOMINANCE and bumped YOUNG FLINT at
the start, raced near the three-path in range for a half, and could not seriously menace. LIL CROWN set the pace inside, got overtaken by SWEENEY'S
CAT approaching the stretch, and was on fumes by the eighth-pole. TORQUE broke slowly, raced three wide early, and never reached contention.
FIVEFINGERDISCOUNT broke two lengths slow, and was always outrun. OVERSTATED broke slowly and was no factor three wide. ASSERT
DOMINANCE broke in causing crowding, got out on the first turn, and was through before reaching the stretch. YANKEE BATBOY broke two lengths slow,
and was far back throughout. COMPASS CAY bore out badly on the first turn, and dropped far back after a half.
