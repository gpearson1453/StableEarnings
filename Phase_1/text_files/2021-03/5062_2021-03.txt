Footnotes
TAAMER vied outside CASH NOW and MACHIAVELLI early, got the best of those two and moved inward as GEMO and THE REIGN MAN came calling
from his right flank after a half-mile, gave that pair the slip past the eighth-pole and drove clear. THE REIGN MAN was never far back, moved menacingly
four wide on the turn, brushed with GEMO through the furlong grounds and prevailed over that rival for the place. GEMO was moving his head at the break
and came out two lengths behind the next-to-last horse, moved to challenge between horses near the five-sixteenths, exchanged brushes with THE REIGN
MAN through mid stretch while staying on his left lead, and was outfinished for second. CASH NOW contested the early pace inside rivals, got outpaced
through the turn, shifted out widest at the top of the stretch and had nothing more. MR. CESCO was no factor three to four wide. MACHIAVELLI argued the
early pace between CASH NOW and TAAMER, and was finished after a half.

Footnotes
GAGA OH LA LA set the pace in the two path, shrugged off a challenge nearing the lane, re-cleared in upper stretch and widened while ridden out. SIREN'S
LUCKY SONG tracked the pace outside, bid four wide nearing the lane and was clearly second best in the lane. KAREN'S WAY pressed the winner in the
three path, reached near even terms by the five-sixteenths pole but weakened in the lane. RAINBOW BELLE saved ground and failed to menace. BENEFIT
ST hit the starting gate, raced well back two wide and never threatened. MIRACULOUS had brief speed four wide. MAVI was outrun while racing three wide.

COWBOY AT HEART set a pressured pace inside, shook off SOUL DANCER through mid stretch and drew clear under a drive. THE RED MAN chased
three to four wide around the turn, and was along outside SOUL DANCER late for the place. SOUL DANCER pressed the winner from outside to the
eighth-pole, and weakened. SOUPER BOOM hit the left side of the gate at the start, saved ground up close early, moved out approaching the stretch, went
back in past the eighth-pole and was empty. NACHO SUPREME was outrun inside. KHOZAN'S KOOKIN broke slowly and showed little inside. THIS RACE
WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
NINETYDAYSOFWINTER tracked the pace four wide, angled into the two path nearing the five-sixteenths pole, took over approaching the quarter pole,
drew clear in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the lane, angled out late and lasted under a drive. EXCALIBUR saved ground off the pace,
angled four wide near the quarter pole, rallied down the center of the track and just missed. ALASTOR set the pace along the rail, was collared near the
quarter pole and stayed on hold third. HARPER GO LUCKY failed to menace while racing four wide. PROSPECT PROJECT stalked the pace three wide
and faded after a half. TOOK A CAB prompted the pace two wide and was through after a half. POINT WINNER was sluggish at the start and trailed inside.

Footnotes
FULLY LOADED tracked outside the dueling leaders for three-eighths of a mile, took over outside EARTH into the final furlong, and was all out to repel late
challengers from both sides. WHAT'S INSIDE saved ground in the middle of the field for three furlongs, bid in the two-path through deep stretch and just
missed inside the winner. LEGAL DEAL was never far back, moved out and had some difficulty cornering five wide at the top of the stretch, finished with
good courage and missed narrowly outside the top two. MARCELINO broke slowly, alternated between the rail and the two-path on the turn, moved out
rallying past the eighth-pole, then lacked room behind the leaders and could not be fully set down late. KOBE FIFTY TWO broke slowly, lagged well back to
the stretch, angled to the far outside leaving the furlong grounds and gained mildly. EARTH dueled inside HENRY'S WORLD to the stretch, and gave way
past the eighth-pole. FAIR CATCH was no factor three to four wide. HENRY'S WORLD vied for command outside EARTH early, and weakened in upper
stretch. DON FAGER broke two lengths slow, moved inside and trailed.

Footnotes
AWESOME ANNMARIE vied two wide down the backstretch, drew clear around the turn and widened under a drive in the lane. GILDED LADY chased the
winner three wide, could not keep pace in the lane but was clearly second best. FAST CATALINA hit the starting gate to get away clearly last, advanced
outside down the backstretch, was in range four wide around the turn and lacked a stretch rally. GASPARILLA BLAST had some early speed between foes,
steadied near the five-eighths pole, raced three wide around the turn and improved position outside. BIRD MAP had brief speed inside of the winner. GREY
JAZMINE had early speed between foes but was through early.

Footnotes
JABUTICABA took command at once, rated along through a manageable pace slightly off the inside, and remained clear late under a mild drive.
LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN went along in the two-path within range, moved out a bit more through the stretch and was up outside rivals for second. ZODIAC
PRINCESS checked while rank under restraint on the first turn, remained on hold inside while hemmed in entering the far turn, stayed on the rail through the
lane and finished one-paced. VITAEMI prompted the pace outside JABUTICABA to the stretch, had the rider drop the whip leaving the eighth-pole, and was
outfinished between horses for larger shares. ISADORABLE AIDA raced three wide on the turns, and lacked the needed closing bid. FEATURE
CREATURE steadied along the fence inside LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN entering the first turn, moved out three wide and posed no threat. CODRINGTON was
slow into stride early inside, and never reached contention. MAGICGIRL trailed throughout toward the inside.

CAIRO CAMPAIGN set a clear pace along the rail and held firm under a drive. SEMPER FI stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch, bid
outside of the winner but was turned back. AMERICAN NINJA saved ground off the pace, angled three wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally. UNCLE
CURLY went evenly while racing two and three wide. BURLY BOY never threatened while racing four wide throughout. MR. TIP bumped with TIO WIL at
the start, raced off the pace three wide, clipped heels entering the stretch and lacked any further bids. TIO WIL was bumped at the start, rated in the three
path, retreated nearing the lane and was clipped behind by MR. TIP near the three-sixteenths pole. RUN-UP WAS UNAVAILABLE.

clear while swapping leads back and forth late. BATTLE CRY saved ground outsprinted early, moved out widest for the drive and finished well to be clearly
second best. BIG RINGS bumped with RESTOFTHESTORY shortly after the start, pressed the latter from outside for a half, and faded through the stretch.
RESTOFTHESTORY bumped with BIG RINGS after the start, set a pressured pace near the inside, and tired after a half. TWIN BRIDGES followed behind

Footnotes
ESPECIALLEA saved ground in range, tipped two wide nearing the quarter pole, reached near even terms turning for home, vied to the eighth pole,
switched back to the left lead leaving that marker and burst clear under a drive. THE GREAT OZ set a clear pace along the rail, fought on inside of the
winner in upper stretch, could not keep pace leaving the eighth pole but stayed on to save the place. CITY MAGIC chased the pace three wide, made some
progress in upper stretch but flattened out a bit in the final furlong. BOLD MINISTER raced well back inside, swung eight wide turning for home, rallied
outside but evened out in the final sixteenth. AMERICAN GREAT raced well back two wide, bumped with HEY PADRE nearing the lane, raced between
foes in the lane and never threatened. CORE CURRICULUM failed to menace while racing two and three wide. EL ROMANTICO saved ground off the
pace, swung out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. HEY PADRE saved ground in midpack, bumped with AMERICAN GREAT nearing the lane, steadied in
upper stretch, angled out soon after, lugged in and faded. CORRELATE played no factor while racing two and three wide. BRETT'S WORLD was reluctant
to load and made little impact while racing three and four wide. NAVY PIER stalked the pace two wide and retreated in the lane. BIG CITY DREAMS had
early speed three wide but was through after a half.
