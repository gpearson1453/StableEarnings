Footnotes
WISH IN THE CASTLE settled off the pace in the three path, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then dug in
for the lead later yards and raced clear nearing the wire. RAVIN' MAVEN raced well off the early pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase into
the backstretch, angled to the five path on the far turn and dug in to take second the final stride. CHESTNUT LIME raced with the early pace two deep then
took the nod approaching the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths, came in a path and had his heels clipped by Fibertown
toward the quarter, rounded the turn near the rail and was caught later yards. BRILLIANT IDEAS saved ground off the early pace, bid leaving the three
eighths pole but checked off the heels of FIBERTOWN, who had just clipped the heels of Chestnut Lime nearing the quarter pole, came through the far turn
in the three and four paths then finished well, while the latter raced with the early pace inside, gave chase from the nine sixteenths pole, was shut off and
clipped the heels of Chestnut Lime approaching the quarter pole, then couldn't recover stride. HE SURPRISED ME raced off the pace in the three and four
paths, showed little response through the backstretch and was eased the final quarter mile. A Stewards inquiry resulted in the disqualification of Chestnut
Lime to fifth place, for coming in across the path of Fibertown, causing the latter to clip heels nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
USED TO BE FUN was carried to the four path into the opening turn then stalked two deep entering the backstretch, challenged from the three eighths pole
and raced with the edge three wide on the far turn, briefly ceded the advantage toward the top of the lane but dug in under steady encouragement to
recover the lead later yards while holding off the game stretch challenge of CRIMSON RIDE, who drifted into the opening turn then rated a slim lead toward
the inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and was met at even terms into the far turn, raced at a close disadvantage while between
horses through the turn and dug in to take second later yards while outfinished for the win. SARAH BELLUM rated off the early pace toward the inside, bid
nearing the five sixteenths pole and came through the far turn at the rail to take the nod toward the head of the lane, dug in under steady encouragement
from that point but was caught flattening stride later yards. WATERLOO ROSE was carried to the six path into the first turn and raced outside entering the
backstretch, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and finished evenly. ZAP MAMA was carried to the five
path into the opening turn then stalked three wide entering the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far
turn then flattened. ROYALANDTOULOUSE raced off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch but showed little
response.

WINDSOR'S FUN lunged and bobbled leaving the gate but took quick control to set a well reserved pace, was given rein at the rail on the turn, prompted
mildly into the lane and drew off, much the best. JEFFERSON COUNTY chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn and settled for second best. IRON
HENRY chased, raced off the rail on the turn then dueled for third. EIGHT OF DIAMONDS gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened
in the stretch duel for third. YOUCANTFIXSTUPID gave chase and raced in the three path of the turn.

Footnotes
GLAD MOON (GER) settled close toward the inside and lacked room through the second turn, angled four wide to give chase into the backstretch, took the
lead nearing the three eighths pole, contested the edge off the rail on the far turn and drew clear in the upper stretch, then held well with steady handling.
WASJUANNOWPAUL settled off the pace about the four path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close four wide on the far turn, dug in to take
second later yards and was gaining slowly on the winner. KATMAN QUICK had the early lead inside then stalked from the thirteen sixteenths pole, picked
up the chase nearing the three eighths and dueled close at the rail rounding the far turn, but dropped back midway through the turn and flattened inside the
sixteenth pole. CANTAKEITANYMORE raced off the pace in the four and five paths then raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and ran close three wide on the far turn, though flattened the final sixteenth. TIZEZZY stalked the early pace three wide, challenged into the
backstretch and gave chase from that point, but flattened stride while losing ground on the far turn. FRANKIE DOTS raced well back from contention early
on. THE CREEP took the lead two deep while between horses leaving the thirteen sixteenths pole and raced with the pace, but dropped back toward the
five sixteenths, checked at the rail approaching the quarter and weakened on the far turn.

Footnotes
GOLDEN KEY angled to the inside to set a clear pace, was pressured into the turn and raced at the rail through the turn, then steadily handled down the
lane. SPURN chased, raced off the rail on the turn and proved no match in the lane. DERBY DAY DREAMS chased the early pace inside, steadied inside
Uncle Funky leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the turn and finished evenly. ADDING MACHINE gave chase inside, raced at the rail
on the turn and finished evenly. RUSTY THE UPS MAN chased outside, raced in the six path of the turn and finished evenly to pass rivals.
MISSIONSNINETYNINE gave chase and faded in the five path of the turn. NO CHANGE and EISELE were not factors, nor was HENRY STANDINGBEAR.
UNCLE FUNKY angled in to engage in close early chase, but was pulled up with a fatal injury nearing the five sixteenths pole and had to be euthanized on
the track.

Footnotes
TAR HEEL PALACE angled to the inside and rated a clear pace, was pressured leaving the three eighths pole, opened up at the rail on the far turn, then
continued to widen under mostly, an aggressive hand ride. BUSINESS CLASS stalked from the three path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths
pole, but ultimately settled for second. MAGNIFICENT ROCKET raced just off the early pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
two deep and dueled for third. DOMS LADY saved ground through the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail
on the far turn then flattened in the stretch duel for third. SWEET PIPER saved ground racing well off the pace then made a mild middle bid from the three
eighths pole. LWF DRIVE BYE GAL raced in the five path the opening turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and weakened. CARROT CAKE raced off the pace toward the inside and showed little response through the
backstretch. TRINNI SOPHIA steadied early and raced in the four path of the first turn, left the turn outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole then
weakened on the far turn. TRINNI LOVE brushed the gate upon exit, raced in the six path of the opening turn and was through early.
