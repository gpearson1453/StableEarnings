RESPECT THE HUSTLE was three wide to the backstretch, tracked to the second turn, rallied four wide to the stretch, was on terms in mid stretch then dug
in determinedly. HARVEST A STORM stalked the pace to the backstretch then pushed up to duel three wide to the stretch, resisted the winner to deep
stretch then was an easy second. ANGELO'S PRIDE broke a bit slow, trailed to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch then did not threaten the top
two. CONCENSUS hurried to the lead early, dueled down the backstretch, was outkicked on the second turn and came up empty in the drive. MITHQAAL
pressed the pace while saving ground to the stretch then weakened.

unhurried to the half, raced two then three wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid stretch then could not hold. ALLEYCAT had no speed, settled to the
second turn, bid three wide to the stretch and finished steadily. CLASSY CHASIE was also settled to the half, raced two wide on the second turn then
finished willingly in traffic late. WILL DANCER was hustled to contest the pace, saved grsound to the second turn but tired after six furlongs. LINGUA
