Footnotes
EXPRIMIR prompted the early pace edging to daylight on the far turn, angled four wide to keep outside position in upper stretch would hold inside rivals at
bay drawing off late. TOM T gave a prompted middle move looming on the far turn, extending in the two path down the lane proved no match for the winner
while securing second. MACADOOOO KID tracked evenly through the backside rallying on the inside to bid from the quarter pole finishing evenly the final
sixteenth along the rail. IS SHE QUICK raced second flight improving modestly in the four path. HILLBILLY RICH set a pressured early pace wearing out on
the far turn. YOU'RE MY BOY BLUE was never involved. BIG PERFORMER played no factor. CHILLINLIKAVILLIN was checked into the first turn.
BODYGUARD tracked through the far turn then faded in upper stretch. JOES A ROCKIN was always outrun.

DARK TEMPTRESS stalked the pace drawing even three deep in upper stretch needing full extension to prevail at the wire. LICHITA sent hard pressed a
narrow lead to upper stretch dueling between horses down the lane staying on gamely to the end. FANGIRL pressed then chased on the turn engaging from
the rail in upper stretch battling to the wire. SHE'S A TROOPER was a step slow throughout. SIERRA DIAMOND pressured the pace through the turn
wilting in upper stretch. TRUST IN ME raced evenly through the turn losing ground to upper stretch tiring there. SAYSO off slowly trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BUMP gave a prompted middle move advancing to a slim lead on the far turn, dueling abreast foe in upper stretch would wear rival down late to clear.
INDIANA RED prompted the pace dueling through the far turn moving inside of rival down the lane ceding grudgingly in the final yards. GRAND DEAL
gained on the backside giving chase through the far turn, lost momentum in upper stretch finishing evenly near mid track. HE'S A BELIEVER pressured the
pace through the backside then tired on the far turn. SHAENA BUE was never involved. DO YOUR BEST showed little. WIZARD OF WAZ hesitated
breaking late.

pack posing no menace. DON'T MATTER was steadied when in close between horses at the break. WATCH THE DIP raced evenly on the outside through
the turn fading in the six path in upper stretch. VAPOR POINT chased to the quarter pole then gave way in upper stretch. J J JUNIOR was never involved.

Footnotes
JUST FLASHY stalked the pace pressing to wrest the lead on the turn edging off some in upper stretch holding under a drive in the four path. O'PRADO
PERK slow early rallied along the inside to upper stretch angling out in mid stretch getting up for place. UNBRIDLED BOILER raced evenly through the turn
rallying to bid five wide in upper stretch hanging under a drive late. ROGUE PATRIOT chased early then raced evenly through the turn, emerged to threaten
again in upper stretch vying willingly the final eighth. YOUNG AMERICAN a step slow through the turn was no factor. NANO sent clear was hooked on the
turn fading along the inside down the lane. INDEPENDENT INDY played no factor. LABYRINTH was always outrun. CORTEGE raced mid pack giving way
to upper stretch.
