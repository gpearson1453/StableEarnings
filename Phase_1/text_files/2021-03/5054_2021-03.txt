Footnotes
TODAYISNOTTHEDAY went to the front, vied for the lead, dueled down the final stretch and drove clear late. RUNFASTANDLOUD challenged for the early
advantage, saved ground around the final turn, dueled down the lane, couldn't keep up with the winner, but was best of rest. LOVE AND LEMONS raced
within contention, made a mild bid, but proved no match for the top two. SUNDEREYA lacked early speed, entered the home stretch wide and showed late
interest, but was no factor. SILENT TRICK void of early speed and passed tired ones. WAR BANDIT raced within striking distance, saved ground around
the final turn and lacked a late kick. ISLAND BLUE had an awkward start, raced in the back and was never a threat. QUICK RAE RAE had an awkward start
and was never close. DATA GIRL always raced near the back and was outrun.

Footnotes
CLOCKED IN TYME unhurried in the beginning, had an outside trip, moved up around the final turn, took command and was going away at the end.
PRIMARY FIRST raced near the middle of the field in the early part, came around the first turn wide, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but
held on for second. SWANEE BEACH lacked early speed, moved up around the final turn, entered the stretch wide, rallied down the lane and missed
second. AUNT SUNSHINE raced in the middle of the pack, showed late interest, while finishing on the rail, but was no factor. ENOUGH HEART challenged
for the early lead and faded. MISS INVADER raced within contention and was finished early. IMPAZIBLE PAT raced in the back of the back in the early part
and passed tired ones late. PRUD AS PUNCH raced within striking distance and dropped back. FICKLE FLASH dueled on the front end in the beginning
and retreated to the rear.

THINKING OF HER void of early speed, came around the second turn on the outside, made a late rally, racing four wide and was a clear second.
ULTIMATE CHALLENGE went to the front, drove clear and lacked a finish. MONEY SUNK pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and missed the
show position. BATTY lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. PADDY O'BELLE raced evenly near the back, finished wide and was no
threat. MISSGREELEY'SSONG had a tight start, raced near the middle of the field, weakened and was no threat late. LAURALEE COCODREE raced in the
middle of the pack in the beginning, faded and was outrun. FEARLESS DIXIE raced within striking distance and dropped back. INSEPARABLE flashed early
speed and stopped.
