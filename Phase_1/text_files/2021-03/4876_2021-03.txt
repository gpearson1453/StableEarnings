drive and made a mild late rally for third. NORTHERN QUEST sat off pace early while in the two path down the backstretch, advanced position in the middle
stages, maintained a two wide trip through the far turn and could not hold off HULA KING for third. GEM STATE sat off early pace while maintaining a
ground saving trip, lost position along the far turn, angled out three wide for the drive and had no late rally. BLUES RAPPER had no early speed, was outrun

CITY CHAMP stalked the pace early, swung out four wide into the stretch then rallied to the front and held driving. GORDON ANTHONY was bumped by
DOGHOUSE into A LITTLE BIT LUCKY at the start, pressed the pace to the turn, dueled two wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch but was
easily second best. A LITTLE BIT LUCKY was bumped by GORDON ANTHONY at the start, had no speed, was two wide to the stretch but lacked the
needed late response. DOGHOUSE broke out, bumped into GORDON ANTHONY which caused a chain reaction of bumping, set the pace to the turn, was
overtaken into the stretch and tired. RUNAWAY KRISTIN was chasing the pace three wide to the stretch then got outkicked and weakened.
LASTBESTHOPE was crowded by A LITTLE BIT LUCKY in the chain reaction bumping at the start, took up and did not recover. The stewards conducted
an inquiry into the start and disqualified DOGHOUSE from fourth to last for interference.

Footnotes
SACRED RIDER pressed the pace to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, collared DESCARTES in mid stretch and inched clear. DESCARTES
set all the pace in the two path to the stretch, dug in when challenged by the winner, resisted to deep stretch then was second best. READY SAY GO
chased the top two to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch then could make no headway in the drive. ON RAGLAN ROAD was outsprinted to the
backstretch, settled to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then lacked the needed late response. STRIKING A POSE had no speed, settled for
a half mile, was also three deep to the stretch and also did not rally. SHADRACK saved ground to no avail. MULHOLLAND HIGHWAY (IRE) was outrun to
the backstretch, settled to the second turn then got fanned four wide to the stretch but weakened in the drive. MAKAH LANE trailed to the second turn then
circled five wide but was not a threat in the lane. IRREFUTABLE settled mid pack for a half mile, came four wide to the stretch but was outrun in the drive.
I'M A COOL DUDE stalked the pace to the backstretch, got outkicked to the second turn and tired after six furlongs.
