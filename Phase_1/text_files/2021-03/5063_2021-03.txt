on well with steady handling. LAST PARTY was crowded on the chute then picked up the chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn at the rail and
finished evenly to be second best. MISTER DEEKS broke inward to make contact with THAT'S FOR SURE and was bumped a stride later by Stolen Biz,
picked up the chase outside, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened stride late, while the latter was bumped leaving the gate, gave chase
through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and showed little more. EMPEROR PENGUIN bobbled on the chute then gave chase, rounded

Footnotes
TAKE ME HOME angled to the inside to set a well reserved pace, was met at even terms into the backstretch but quickly recovered the edge toward the
three eighths pole, drew clear approaching the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn and was kept in hand through the stretch. LADY MACHO
rounded the opening turn about the three path, bid approaching the three eighths pole and improved in the five path of the far turn, but ultimately, had to
settle for second best. KINGSTON TIME settled off the pace inside the opening turn, started a three wide bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn off the rail but showed little more. WEDDING DAY KITTEN saved ground off the pace, bid toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the
far turn and showed little further. I AM I WILL raced in the four path the first turn and left the turn outside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole
but showed little response through the backstretch. SOLID AS A ROCK stalked the earlier pace two deep and drew to even terms into the backstretch, had
a brief lead between calls past the half mile pole, gave chase through the backstretch but faded on the far turn. PROCIDANA raced well back.

LEADING INDICATOR tapered toward mid track to set a pressured pace, contested the edge two deep on the turn, drifted approaching the head of the lane
and dug in under all out handling to hold on. UNCANNY gave early chase toward mid track, raced in the four path of the turn, was carried out nearing the
head of the lane, dug in for second later yards and was gaining steadily on the winner. DIMITRI'S ROMANCE pressured the pace inside and raced at the
rail on the turn, steadied in tight in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at the rail and finished evenly. GLORIOUS MYSTERY gave chase
inside, rounded the turn about the three path, angled to the six path approaching the top of the stretch and passed rivals in an even finish. PAPPAROXY
gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn and finished evenly. SAVANNAH ROXANNA gave early chase outside then saved ground on the turn.
WAGERED gave chase and rounded the turn about the four path. WIGGLE IT JIGGLEIT angled in to pressure the pace, contested the turn nearest the rail
while at a close disadvantage, threatened the winner to mid-stretch, showed no further response to steady urging, suffered a fatal injury later yards and had

Footnotes
BROTHER SKYE stalked the early pace off the rail then took the lead at the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, rounded
the far turn at the rail and dug in under steady handling to hold off PRINCE VALESKI, who took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the
inside to set the pace, was caught at the nine sixteenths pole and settled close from that point, started a rebound bid toward the three eighths pole and
raced at the rail on the far turn, angled to the four path entering the stretch, dug in for second the final yards and was gaining on the winner. BANK ON
CANDY stalked the earlier pace from the three path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, but
flattened stride the final furlong. YES MEANS NO rounded the first turn in the four path and raced well off the pace outside entering the backstretch, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, angled seven wide on the far turn and passed rivals outside. CECIL THE LION saved ground through the first turn and
was well off the pace leaving the turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and finished evenly. LUCKY PARK raced
boxed at the rail the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened. TAURIAN saved
early ground then raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, ran six wide on the far turn then weakened. BRANANX was
unprepared for the break, raced in the five path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths
pole then flattened stride about the five path of the far turn.
