Footnotes
BELLE TAPISSERIE , bumped by APPEALING FUTURE soon after the break, accelerated to a three deep lead entering the turn, remained three wide
around the turn, remained on his left lead in the stretch, pulled away under intermittent urging and lugged in near the sixteenth pole. APPEALING FUTURE
bumped the winner when bearing out leaving the starting gate, showed speed along the inner rail and finished willingly. SEANY P , angled in mid way down
the backstretch, advanced in the two path between horses to challenge for the lead leaving the turn and weakened in the drive. NOVA BOY lacked speed,
swung to the four path in upper stretch and was not a factor. UPLIFTING advanced our deep mid way on the turn then tired.

Footnotes
ITALIAN DRESSING rated forwardly four wide, took closer order and challenged outside embattled rivals into the lane, secured command soon past mid
stretch, drifted in when clear then held firm under a drive. CHLOE ROSE drifted out at the break and bumped with a rival, corrected and edged up between
runners nearing the half mile marker and stalked the pace, awaited room behind rivals past the five sixteenths, altered in near mid stretch, slipped through
along the rail with a sixteenth to go and finished gamely. TARGE prompted the pace two wide outside the leader, bid to engage leaving the far turn, dueled
on a short lead between rivals into the lane, held a tenuous advantage to mid stretch then weakened very late. TRIPLE DIGIT drafted back off the pace
soon after the start, moved up three wide into the far turn, shifted out wider while put to pressure into the stretch and churned on with some interest.
MAVILUS saved ground, eased out through the drive but lacked a solid kick. DOUBLE FIREBALL , bumped at the break, stalked three wide, bid three deep
leaving the far turn, fought on between runners into the lane then faded in the final furlong. SHACKABOOM sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail,
was hounded by rivals leaving the far turn, stayed on while under pressure to the head of the lane, tired and was eased late.

Footnotes
DREAM BIG DREAMS , rated behind horses for five furlongs, swung to the five path turning for home, closed resolutely outside rivals and took command
inside the sixteenth pole. ALOYSIUS LUCK , up close down the backstretch, advanced three deep leaving the turn, gained the lead in mid stretch and gave
way grudgingly. PHAROAH'S FURY set the pace near the inner rail and weakened the final furlong. UNORTHODOX raced in the four path around the turn
and failed to rally. TALES OF SARATOGA bore in when stumbling at the break, chased the pace outside PHAROAH'S FURY to the stretch then faded.
IMAGINE HONGKONG raced in the two path inside horses on the turn and was not a factor. RIPPOLINO hugged the inner rail on the turn, was well placed
leaving the bend and weakened. UNCLE JEROME , checked when pinched back leaving the starting gate, trailed.

Footnotes
SAMMIE SUNSHINE was nudged clear of a rival after a furlong, dropped in and set a rated pace towards the rail, moved away after a half mile, responded
when set down past the three sixteenths then maintained a comfortable advantage while kept to task. INSTINCTIVE had gate speed then was rated back off
the winner leaving the three quarter pole, stalked two wide, was under asking pursuing into the lane then stayed on well to be clear of the rest. BLUE SKY
VENEZUELA , three wide, gave hard chase into the lane and lacked a bid. PARCHED GHOST settled off the rail, raced four wide into the lane, swung wider
past the three sixteenths but could only muster up a mild kick. DRAGONESS circled the turn four wide, was under coaxing into the stretch, moved up
slightly nearing mid stretch then flattened out. SPLENDOR GAL edged up towards the rail in the opening quarter mile, chased around the turn, eased out
and faded. TWO CARAT lagged off the pace, cut the corner under a ride into the lane but failed to menace. STATED lacked speed while two to three wide
and never responded.

Footnotes
BANDOLINI prompted the pace outside PARDON THE PUN around the turn, secured command in upper stretch then drew off while kept to his business.
CONFUSION BABY BOY , four deep leaving the backstretch, circled foes on the turn and chased the winner through the stretch in a nice effort. QUEST OF
GLORY hugged the inner rail most of the race and passed tired foes late. TRUE SHIPMAN worked between horses throughout and failed to rally. FIFTY
SEVEN CHEVY , lightly steadied leaving the backstretch, was taken to the five path entering the stretch and showed mild interest late. LITTLE BAY trailed
to the stretch, raced outside horses in the lane and passed tired ones. PARDON THE PUN showed speed near the rail, raced in the two path in the stretch
and gave way. NIC NIC BOOM , along the inner rail on the turn, failed to be a factor. WHISKEY DREAMIN lacked speed, raced in the three path entering
the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
KEEPYOURGUARDUP rated kindly off the dueling leaders, crept closer in hand mid turn, eased out three wide into the lane, rallied under pressure to take
command outside foes in mid stretch, went clear soon after, drifted in then was fully extended to hold sway. INJECT THE LIGHT drifted in at the break and
bumped with a rival, straightened and rated off the pace, advanced four wide into the lane, ranged up past the eighth pole, bid outside the winner but was
kept at bay. MOONZANO saved ground off the early pace, angled five wide gathering momentum into the stretch then closed steadily on his left lead. HERE
COMES RUDY , bumped at the break, regrouped and edged up towards the inside, shifted out in mid stretch and offered a mild kick.
DOUBLBARRELBOURBON , sluggish while off the rail, angled wider into the lane but lacked a solid finish. SCOTTSDALE got involved in a battle to the
inside of MAGIC OF LOVE soon after the break, ceded command mid turn, kept up the scrum to mid stretch then weakened. RUNBACK saved ground
without threatening. GONNA WIN IT , bumped and pinched back at the break, raced well back into the turn, angled four wide but failed to seriously recover.
MAGIC OF LOVE dueled outside SCOTTSDALE, gained a short lead mid turn, stayed on to mid stretch then surrendered. KEEPYOURGUARDUP was
disqualified per stewards ruling #21-090- phenylbutazone overage.

Footnotes
HYDRA was sent clear early, set the pace towards the rail, handled outside pressure past the five sixteenths, kicked back clear under a drive in upper
stretch then dug in tenaciously to fend off PAISLEY SINGING. PAISLEY SINGING , taken to rate three wide while in range, took closer order past the five
sixteenths, closed steadily through the final furlong but just could not get past. DECOUPAGE saved ground, eased out past mid stretch and closed mildly.
TRUNK OF MONEY broke a step slow, was sent up between soon after, stalked two wide, bid mid turn, forced the issue into the lane then faded. BUNTING
was rated back off the pace, saved ground mid turn and failed to menace. GIFTED HEART was shuffled back early, angled five wide into the lane but failed
to respond.

SKYSCANNER stalked the pace, moved up three deep entering the stretch, took command in upper stretch, drifted in and drew out under brisk urging.
BOUNCING AROUND , rank leaving the starting gate, was steered to the four path mid way on the turn then rallied outside horses. WELLING lacked speed,
raced in the three path leaving the turn then passed tired horses late. GREEK PRINCE hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to mid stretch then faded.
AMEN CORNER saved ground on the turn, angled out for the drive, worked between horses and weakened. HOLY SAINT disputed the pace outside
GREEK PRINCE and gave way approaching the eighth pole. JUSTICE OF WAR , well placed in the two path between horses leaving the backstretch, failed
to keep up on the turn and was being eased through the stretch.
