a step slowly, rushed to contention outside, loomed a threat but tired late. THE POOCH forced the pace inside then the two path and weakened in the final
furlong. DON'T MAKE IT EASY chased wide throughout and gave way readily. NICK THE CARDSHARK raced off the leaders three wide and stopped

inside, widened in mid stretch but was nailed at the wire. LOOKINGFORANEWSPOT pursued the leader to the final furlong and yielded. TIZ A DATE
dropped far behind, chased inside with a mild rally. SPECIAL RISK lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. SHE'S PRIMO raced very wide down the

Footnotes
LOOKIN AT ROSES tracked along the inside, moved up nearing the final turn, chased on the turn, rallied outside of LOOKIN AT ROSES turning for home
and wore down that rival after a long drive. FLAT OUT FLASHY set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the final turn, dug in gamely
when challenged and battled on determinedly through the final furlong. AMI'S ARTIE raced off the pace, chased the leaders on the final turn, lacked a
stretch rally and finished evenly. THE ROBERT trailed the field, raced off the pace inside, moved off the rail, steadied to avoid a fallen rival nearing the
seven sixteenths marker, then did not factor. COMMISSIONER DAVE stalked two wide, lacked a response when asked, steadied to avoid a fallen rival and
gave way. SKIPIN ON ORCHARD raced off the pace, hit a fallen rival nearing the final turn losing the rider, walked off after. O'KRAM raced off the pace
inside, moved up three wide on the backside, then was injured badly, fell nearing the far turn and was euthanized. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the incident,
the race was declared official.

SOUPER FLY OVER settled between foes in the second flight, angled out rallying into the stretch and moved clear under urging. MONTELEONE dueled in
the two path, edged ahead midway on the turn but was outfinished. THOUSAND PERCENT set a pressured pace inside then weakened through the stretch.
MACH TRIAL trailed early then offered some late energy outside. GENGHIS vied three wide down the backstretch and began fading on the turn.
MANOLETE saved ground and gradually faltered while no factor. JUPI'S LIGHTNING eased back in the opening quarter and had no further response.

COLLOQUIUM vied outside under a rating hold, took over after half a mile and remained safe driving. SWEET BLAME well placed behind the dueling
leaders, bid and continued well while no match for the winner. TOMARIE saved ground off the pace, angled out on the final turn and finished willingly.
LOLANITA lagged far behind inside and rallied mildly. DR. ANN hustled leaving the gate, vied inside for half a mile and faded. IZZADORA BELLA chased
wide and weakened steadily. CHECKBOUNCIN BILLY dropped back in the opening quarter and was always outrun.
