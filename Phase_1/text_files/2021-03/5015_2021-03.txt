Footnotes
PURPLE HEARTED moved into the three path after the field had been released, vied as the outermost of a trio for command for most of the journey leading
up to the five-sixteenths marker, took charge when asked springing from that station, lugged over to the rail in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, pilot
countering the miscue with a snug grip on the right, extended the advantage to its largest margin the rest of the way to the eighth pole, had it cut into late,
but held sway. REUNION TOUR one paced in path three for the opening half, slid over to the inside route at the top of the turn, flashed interest late on the
bend, still being held in reserve, angled four wide for racing room entering the lane, had a good finish down the center of the strip to procure the place. GOT
THE GOLD rated in the pocket until midpoint on the turn, tipped out into the two path for the stretch run, got outkicked. WICKED EASY strung out four wide
on the turn, commenced the stretch slightly closer to the rail, tired. JADE'S DREAM towards the inside, argued as the innermost of a three for nearly
three-quarters, faltered. KING MOONRACER pressed the issue from path two in between foes until around the five-sixteenths marker, folded.

Footnotes
HAMMERIN AAMER prompted the leader from the outside three wide, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths and took command just outside that
station, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive inching away to the finish kept to task. FRANKIE BARONE chased four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors in the late stages. BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE hustled from the gate, showed the way
lightly coaxed just off the inside under some pressure from HAMMERIN AAMER to the outside, came under a drive near the five-sixteenths when headed
for command, spun just off the inside for home, fought on to the sixteenth marker before weakening in the late stages. PLAYWRIGHT chased three then two
wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and made no headway. MILLS chased along the inside down the
backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and offered no
response. HERO'S HOPE broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, went three wide
into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
JUST READ IT away in good order, was firmly rated pressing the issue from the two path, turned into the lane still abreast of the nemesis, challenged in
earnest in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker, took over, edged away to her largest lead during the remainder of the run leading up to the eighth pole,
came under an intense assault from the rail-hugging EXOGEN, dug in gamely to fend off that rival off. EXOGEN tracked the front runners from along the
inside, was forced to bide time and draft off the left shoulder of SAVE during the final stages of the run around the bend, saw that opponent shift into path
two spinning into the stretch, availed of the opportunity with which to launch a rail rally along an open corridor, clawed up to the winner, enough so as to
loom boldly by the beginning of the final furlong, maintained the momentum, continuing to whittle away at the deficit, fell short, then was reported after the
race to have bled. SAVE emerged at the shadow of the gate in possession of the lead, moved inward, showed the way, spaced at a slight at a slight
distance from off the inside, with JUST READ IT putting on some pressure from the outside, was put to the test by that foe nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
relinquished then weakened steadily in the last eighth. SALT PLAGE pursued the pace from the three path, got set down a short distance from the end of
the bend, angled into the path four for entrance into the stretch, lacked the necessary response.

TEETOTALER chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, rallied loosely between foes and took command just inside the eighth pole when getting the whip knocked out of the rider's grip to the near
side by the rider of BREAKFASTATBONNIES when that rival employed an off sided stick, edged away under a drive to the finish to prevail kept to task.
PLEASURE LUCK three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the
place honors. BREAKFASTATBONNIES established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn and slipped
away through the latter portion of the bend given some rein to work with, spun just off the inside into upper stretch set down for the drive, dug in under threat
from a pair, got collared just inside the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. SHANES PRETTY LADY chased along the inside under prolonged

Footnotes
PROFUSION brushed at the start, raced from off the inside, underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, got let out leaving the five-sixteenths marker, closed
the gap readily, emerged at the eighth pole vying for command from between rivals, emerged at a sixteenth later engaged one on one with WARFRONT
FIGHTER, gamely bested that foe. WARFRONT FIGHTER got set up in path four after making light contact with OUR LUCKY MAN right after the field had
been sent off and running, travelled four wide on the turn, was as wide under a drive stepping onto the head of the stretch, drew up to the leader, fought as
the widest of three from midlane to the sixteenth pole, then dueled with the top one from that station onward, wound up the one to be denied.
BALLYDOOLEY (GB) grabbed control and cut over to the inside, extended the lead making its way on the turn, settled in upper stretch and was turned
loose, came under attack from the first two finishers soon afterwards, offered resistance for a sixteenth before weakening into the show slot. CHAMBO
made it over to the rail after departing the backstretch, was under a drive swinging three wide into the lane, shifted one path farther off the rail a few jumps,
mustered up a mild response sufficient enough for the final significant slice of the purse. CONFECTIONER kept watch on the pace towards the inside route
by the top of the turn, was still along it entering the stretch, got outkicked. OUR LUCKY MAN took up the chase two then three wide on the turn, got sent out
into path five from upper to midstretch, made no impact. LEAS TALKIN ALOT sighted saving ground while pulling a bit on the bit early, slipped to the outside
coming up to the midway point of the turn, angled four wide stepping into the stretch, lacked the needed offering. MACLEAN'S LEGACY bumped with MR
GAZZO after bobbling at the start, got guided over to the inside, never made its presence felt. MR GAZZO bumped at the start, chased the pace two wide
while forwardly placed, began to fall back shortly after going onto the turn, lost its best action after coming up a ride approaching the five-sixteenths pole, got
eased down the stretch, then walked off the track.

MOONACHIE coaxed from the gate, showed the way early on until displaced from the front nearing the nine-sixteenths by BASSMAN DAVE, chased that
rival just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, advanced and spun three wide into upper stretch, seized command
straightened away, edged clear under a drive kept busy to the finish. QUICKFLASH four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home safe for the place honors. FINANCIALSTABILITY four then three wide in pursuit
detached at the tail of the field when devoid of speed early on, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch,
closed outside kicking on belatedly to procure the show honors. LEAP TO GLORY chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three
wide into upper stretch and offered no response. TIZ KAZ NOW hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from midway on the turn,
swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. Following a shoe repair in the paddock, BASSMAN DAVE forwardly placed three paths off the inside down the
backstretch, advanced to take over command near the nine-sixteenths, tucked inside through the turn shaking away through the bend before coming under
growing threat to the outside, came under coaxing in response nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home and yielded the front straightened
away, then folded in the stretch.

Footnotes
REED KAN gradually made his way to the inside after establishing the top, appeared to be nearly two body lengths to the good tucking into path two a panel
into the contest, moved further inward in time to begin the run around the bend on the inside route, showed the way tailed by the runner up to its outside,
was approaching the three-sixteenths marker when asked for more, gave the desired response and kicked well clear. VICI assumed the role of primary
pursuer, was towards the two path stalking the winner, came under a brisk hand ride at the five-sixteenths pole, proved no match when the winner was
turned loose himself, narrowly saved second. THE SICARII bobbled slightly losing his footing springing from the starting gate, departed the backstretch from
path three, got driven towards the five path entering the stretch, ground its way up to VICI, came up on the short end of the place photo. SNEAKINESS
appeared unsettled puling on the bit while being worked to the inside during the initial stages, got bumped off stride after making contact with AJNADEEN at
the five-eighths pole, recovered after the temporary loss of momentum, took up the chase two wide on the turn, still offering some resistance on the bit,
swung out wide stepping onto the top of the lane, had no response. AJNADEEN gunned out of the gate, remained stationed along the rail, made some
contact with SNEAKINESS midway on the backstretch, shook it off and resumed its pursuit, with the rider continuing to encourage the mount, cut the corner
into the lane and backed away. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on an incident on the backstretch, in addition to a claim of foul lodged by the rider of
SNEAKNIESS against the rider of REED KAN alleging interference, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

DARK MONEY three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a
good finish outside to close in on the leader with a pair overhauling that rival inside the sixteenth marker and was just up to score on the wire. BUSTIN
TIMBERLAKE traded a bump at the start with GOLANI BRIGADE when breaking in a step as that rival broke outwards, came under coaxing and chased
three then two wide in closest aim of the spurting away leader, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, closed well between foes through the late stages
and just missed at the finish. BRONX BOMBER leapt up at the break getting away last and conceding three lengths to the front, chased three then two wide
from near the rear detached from the main body of the field in tandem with DOUBLE SHOT, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, made ground and
swung three wide into upper stretch, threaded his way through some light traffic showing good courage to to get within a neck of the top pair at the wire.
STEAM ENGINE broke out at the start and was corrected coming under hustling to show the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn
spurting away, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive clear to the eighth pole, came under growing late threat from a trio and was overhauled
inside the final sixteenth while able to preserve the last major share. GOLANI BRIGADE traded a bump at the start with BUSTIN TIMBERLAKE when
breaking outwards as that rival broke inwards, came under coaxing and chased just off the inside until tucked to the rail half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. PATEGORY ONE five then four wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home, made some late ground but was outkicked. DOUBLE SHOT four paths off the
inside down the backstretch detached near the rear in tandem with BRONX BOMBER, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, made ground through to the finish while not improving position and unable to make an impact. MORE
GRAYTFUL struck the near side stall at the start, chased four then three wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four
wide for home and weakened.

Footnotes
SUMMER BREW assumed a forward position, pressed the issue from path three, was put to a drive turning into the lane, wrested away control during the
ensuing furlong, held IRRESISTABLE GIRL at bay, kept to some urging to the end. IRRESISTIBLE GIRL tracked the front runners towards the inside route,
was put to stronger handling springing from the five-sixteenths pole, got steered to the outside as the half was being reeled off, wound up in path four by the
three-sixteenths pole, proved no match, then got geared down for the final seventy yards with the place not in danger of being lost. BLACK PANDA a pace
factor from the inside on the backstretch, saw ESOTICA assert herself stepping onto the top of the turn, began to lose contact with the top twosome late on
the bend, cut the corner into the lane, went on to claim the show from a weakening ESOTICA in the final stages. ESOTICA disputed the pace from along the
outside, stepped onto the turn in the two path holding the advantage, got put to the test by SUMMER BREW as they spun into the stretch directly abreast of
each other heading home, relinquished for good soon afterwards then steadily backed away. WINDS OF CAPRI taken hold getting pinched after stumbling
at the start, raced mostly two wide on the turn, was about as wide entering the turn, alongside a riderless rival, never made her presence felt. MAYBE I
KNOW took up position towards the rear, was just off the rail coming up to a prostrate rider at the three-eighths pole, lost its own pilot trying to hop off over
him, then got escorted off the track after being subsequently apprehended. TELLAPERFECTTALE worked its way into the two path on the backstretch, lost
her rider being maneuvered to the outside avoiding a fallen rival and jockey in the vicinity of the three-eighths pole, was apprehended by an outrider and
escorted off the track. KISS ME DAVE took up the chase from path two in midpack, fell fatally losing her rider at the midway point on the turn. Following a
Stewards' Inquiry focusing on an incident on the turn, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.
