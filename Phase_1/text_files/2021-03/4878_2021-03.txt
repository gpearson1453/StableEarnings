Footnotes
BERACUDA HEART broke inward and bumped ROCKET RIDE in the opening strides, was urged for speed three deep on the backstretch, shook to the
lead approaching the seven sixteenths, set the pace in the two path on the bend, continued on a clear lead in upper stretch, went to a drive near the furlong
mark, and held sway. OFF TO THE BEACH settled at the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, was pushed along from the three eighths, went to a drive
inside in upper stretch, responded with a rally, ran on between horses late but came too late to reel in the leader. DISTINCT THUNDER was sent for pace
inside, brushed with ROCKET RIDE approaching the turn, tracked BERACUDA HEART while racing in the three path on the turn, went to a drive in upper
stretch while no match for BERACUDA HEART at that point, chased on with continued interest, gained late three wide but was outfinished for the place.
ROCKET RIDE was bumped by BERACUDA HEART in the opening strides, was sent for pace between horses, brushed with DISTINCT THUNDER
approaching the half mile mark, tracked the pace in the four path around the bend, went to a drive in upper stretch, and chased on without finding the
needed kick. TO THE BANK chased the leading trio down the backstretch and in the five path on the turn, was driven five wide in upper stretch, and offered
no rally.

Footnotes
BODEMAX led the field throughout, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was kept to task to the wire. LADY MAGNA chased
the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path while racing around the far turn, continued to chase the winner home and had to
settle for second best. GOLDEN LILY trailed the field on the inside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground on the outside
in late stretch. TRUE TO JEANINE raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path, swung
wide to enter the stretch from the three path and weakened in the final furlong. BE AUTHENTIC stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground from the middle of the pack around the turn, and tired in the stretch.

DOM THE BOMB was bumped between horses in the opening strides but nevertheless soon cleared the field, set the pace in the two to three path on the
turn, and held sway under a drive. RIPE ATTACK stumbled at the start, chased well off the leading pair down the backstretch and while saving ground
around the bend, was urged for an inside bid into the lane, and kept on willingly to the wire while proving second best. ENZOEXPRESS bobbled out of the
gate and broke outward, bumped DOM THE BOMB in the opening strides, tracked the pace set by that foe in the four path on the turn, went to a drive
approaching the quarter pole, and weakened through the final furlong. HIGH HERO broke slightly in and bumped DOM THE BOMB in the opening strides,
settled at the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch but offered no bid.

KIANA'S LOVE dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was ridden out to
the wire. DUSTY MILLER was squeezed back at the start, brushing with the horse to her inside, recovered to race in the middle of the pack on the outside
up the backstretch, raced two wide around the turn, began a bid with a furlong to go and was no match for the winner. LIL B QUICK fought her rider up the
backstretch and into the turn, settled in to enter the stretch from the two path, and gained ground on the outside in late stretch while drifting out mildly.
MORA VALLEY dueled for the lead on the outside through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the turn and faded in the stretch. HER GOLD
MINE trailed the field up the backstretch and around the turn, swung three wide entering the stretch and was empty from there. VEGAN GOES BEST
veered out and bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace between horses early, saved ground around the turn and tired on
the rail in the stretch.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S ROSE chased near the rear inside of WILDWOOD SCAT early, took gradually closer order in the two path on the turn, was driven inside in upper
stretch, kept on unrelentingly inside of VALIANT LADY and got up in the final strides. VALIANT LADY sent for pace, dueled inside of TROPHY BRIDLE from
past the five eighths, shook clear of that foe in upper stretch, kept on under a drive, but was caught in the final jumps. LADY EXPRESS settled at the rear,
improved while saving ground on the turn, swung out to the eight path in upper stretch and went to a drive, found her best stride in the final sixteenth and
got up for show. TROPHY BRIDLE was asked for pace, engaged outside of VALIANT LADY past the five eighths, dueled two wide to upper stretch, could
not match strides with VALIANT LADY from upper stretch, chased the leading pair down the lane and lost show late. HEY HEY tracked the dueling pair
down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, was driven four wide in upper stretch, and flattened out. WILDWOOD SCAT chased two wide early,
raced in the four path in the rear pair on the turn, went to a drive past the five sixteenths, offered no response, and was allowed to fade from midstretch.

Footnotes
ANTRIM'S GIANT raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the frontrunner between horses up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around
the far turn, and then dueled down the stretch on the outside to get up in the final strides. SERTOMAN brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the
gate, recovered to lead the field from the rail around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and dueled down the
stretch, giving way late. LEMON BLITZ bobbled slightly leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the
backstretch, ran into traffic and was forced to steady headed into the far turn, entered the stretch from the two path and gained some ground on the outside
from there. YOU'RE IN COREY was bumped and squeezed back leaving the gate, continued to race in tight quarters headed into the first turn, angled out to
the three path to find room, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path passing the half mile pole, and
weakened in the final furlong. RIVER EVANGELIST broke slowly, navigated the first turn from the two path, trailed the field up the backstretch, began a bid
from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, entered the stretch from the three path and was outkicked late.

I'M CORFU was placed on the lead, set the pace down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, opened up under light hand urging in upper stretch
and coasted home. COLONEL KLINK broke inward, tracked the leader early inside of FOLLOW THE SIGNS, switched out approaching the three eighths to
track I'M CORFU from the three path, went to a drive in upper stretch outside that foe, proved no match but kept on safe for the place. FOLLOW THE
SIGNS was pushed for pace early, tracked the pace outside of COLONEL KLINK, began to lose ground past the seven sixteenths while racing in the five to
six path on the bend, went to a drive past the three eighths but still proved unable to keep pace with the leading pair, chased on down the lane while losing
further ground to the top pair but salvaged the show. BULLDOG OF BERGEN settled at the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, went to a drive near
the quarter pole, and lacked the needed kick. HERE COMES KYLE broke out and grazed the gate on his way out, chased toward the rear down the
backstretch and in the three path around the bend, went to a drive into upper stretch, and faded.

MAXIMUS IMAGE trailed the field on the rail around the first turn, began to move up on the inside up the backstretch, took over nearing the three eighths
pole and drew off while drifting out down the lane. Z U SOON raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, began a bid
from the two path approaching the five sixteenths pole and proved to be the best of the rest while drifting in down the stretch. CONSPICUOUS BOX raced in
the two path around the first turn, settled in in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and made a
mild gain of ground in the stretch. TORNADO BOY raced in three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, angled
in to save ground around the far turn, made a mild bid in upper stretch and flattened out from there. DRIVER DAN was hustled out of the gate to grab the
early lead, showed the way from the rail around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the far turn and
continued to tire between horses in the stretch.
