Footnotes
CONSTITUTIONAFFAIR stalked a bit off the rail then in the two path, bid alongside at the quarter pole, took over and kicked clear in upper stretch, then
drew away under strong handling. LIAR LIAR (IRE) angled in early then moved off the rail into the backstretch, traveled two then three wide around the far
turn, came out and chased five wide in upper stretch, then rallied to best the rest. RAGER sat off the pace two or three wide, went two wide around the far
turn, angled out four wide entering the stretch and got outkicked for the place. TALKING tracked the leader from inside around the first turn then moved out
into the two path, remained two wide to the stretch, finished evenly through the final furlong and was outfinished for the place and show. HOOP DREAM
stumbled a bit at the start, raced off the pace along the inside, came off the rail entering the lane, lacked room in upper stretch, moved out to a clear path
and improved position late. WITCH'S VOW sped to the front from inside, controlled the pace up the backstretch, challenged at the quarter pole and offered
little resistance to the winner leaving that turn, then faded inside the furlong grounds. CHASING FAME tucked inside on the first turn, stayed inside to the
stretch then tipped out and weakened.

OUR BONNIE LASS dueled for the lead outside of WATCH THE FED, cleared foe past the three-eighths and widened under hand urging. KEEP IT
CLASSY tracked the top pair from inside, steered out into the clear on the backstretch, took the second turn three then four wide, summoned a mild rally
and was clearly second best. WATCH THE FED dueled with OUR BONNIE LASS for command along the inside, lost contact past the three-eighths, drifted
into the lane and weakened. SLEWPYS LAST SONG stumbled and propped at the start, went around rivals two then three wide on the first turn, took closer
order up the backstretch, chased off the rail then two wide into the stretch and weakened. PARTYATTHECAPITAL went three then two wide around the
clubhouse turn, moved to the fence, angled out on the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
BIG CLARE was off slow to begin, steadied off heels on the first turn, settled at the back, went outside a rival on the backstretch, came out on the far turn
and exited four wide, struck the front in upper stretch, cleared while drifting to the inside and stayed strong to the wire. MENSA ON TAP was off a bit slow to
begin, pulled around the first turn from off the rail, moved up to apply pressure past the seven-sixteenths, dueled around the bend and took over at the
quarter pole, put away inside rival nearing the lane, was overtaken in upper stretch and stayed on to secure the place. SUNSHINE BABE stalked outside a
rival, coaxed three wide on the far turn, bid between in upper stretch but flattened out a bit in deep stretch. WARRIOR LADY stalked the pace inside then in
the two path under reserve, angled to the rail on the second bend, tipped out in the drive and lacked a rally. ALOT OF MAGIC steadied briefly off the heels
of the leader on the first turn, chased along the rail to the far turn, eased out into the two path around that bend, waited for room at the top of the lane,
angled out into the clear and flattened in the furlong grounds. STRIKING TIGRESS sped clear and crossed over to the inside, pressed leaving the
backstretch, dueled around the far turn and faded in the stretch.

a mild bid three deep at the quarter pole, could not kick on with the top pair, drifted out a bit from left-handed urging and flattened while maintaining the
show. TIP TOP GAL bobbled at the start, raced four deep into the first turn or five wide then moved into the four path, stayed four to five wide around the far
turn and came up empty. MONGOLIAN WINDOW threw head her head in a rank beginning, trailed the field in the two path then moved inside for the far
turn, entered the stretch a bit off the rail and was never a factor.

Footnotes
EQUILOVE (IRE) came away a bit slow, tracked under some reserve, went two then three wide around the turn, closed under right-handed urging and
strong handling and reeled in the runner-up in deep stretch. XMAS SURPRISE stalked off the rail then bid outside around the turn, led into the stretch,
kicked clear and led to deep stretch and got caught late. CIELO D'ORO broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, settled off the pace, was bothered by
rival and steadied nearing the half-mile pole, angled to the two path after then came three wide into the stretch and got up for the show. BOWL OF
CHERRIES was along the inside early while in range, lost ground into the turn, stayed inside to the stretch, kept on and earned a minor award. NOBU sped
to the front and set the pace up the backstretch, relinquished the lead leaving the bend and flattened in the late stages. LADY MACARENA chased behind
the speed two wide into and around the turn, shifted out in upper stretch, eased past the eighth pole and walked off. FLAPS UP bumped from outside at the
start, was hard to ride while drifting out on the backstretch, went four wide into the turn then moved to the inside around the bend and faded.

Footnotes
GOTTA BE LUCKY established the front quickly, set all the pace to the stretch, asked right-handed in the drive and inched away. LUCKY LONG LEGS
moved to the inside early and was well placed behind the leader, cut the corner into the stretch and outkicked SECRET SQUARE for second. SECRET
SQUARE was closest in pursuit early in the two path, asked at the three-eighths, chased three wide into the stretch, could not find the needed late response
and was outfinished for the place honors. PASITO stalked in the three path on both turns and could not rally when needed. REALREALGOOD steadied at
the seven-eighths pole, raced two wide to the stretch and failed to menace. INFO'S TREASURE fractious in the gate, steadied off heels passing the finish
line the first time, went two wide into the first turn then moved inside around the bend, came off the rail on the backstretch, entered the stretch four wide and
was never a factor.

Footnotes
BRANDOTHEBARTENDER settled off the pace outside a rival, went two wide around the bend, angled out in the stretch, rallied five wide and drew clear
late. JAMMING EDDY stalked from inside then moved out into the two path, came three wide into the stretch, tipped out at the top of the stretch, rallied and
was outclosed by the winner while getting bumped late. DESMOND DOSS showed early speed inside of JETOVATOR then was in a bit tight at the
seven-sixteenths, chased inside to the lane, steadied in upper stretch then lacked room to the sixteenth pole, gained a clear path and finished well along the
fence. JETOVATOR set the pace outside of DESMOND DOSS then cleared that rival approaching the seven-sixteenths, led a bit off the rail into the drive,
clung to a short lead with a sixteenth to go then drifted out and brushed rival late. PEACEFUL TRANSFER chased off the inside, asked at the quarter pole,
bid between rivals then got bumped late which halted his momentum. PRODIGAL SON sat off the pace inside the winner, saved ground through the turn,
came out in the stretch and needed to find more. MARGOT'S BOY tracked off the rail, went three to four wide around the bend and weakened. PEACEFUL
TRANSFER raced as ROYAL TRUMP.

Footnotes
PELICAN WAY got bumped leaving the gate, advanced up the backstretch, gained ground through the turn, rallied outside the leader and got up late. STIR
THE POT away quickly and crossed over to he inside, showed the way in the two path through the turn, shifted inward in upper stretch and got caught late.
BETITO broke out a bit, stalked the pace from inside, came off the rail a bit on the turn then moved back to the rail, switch outside the leader at the eighth
pole but lacked the needed late kick. LUCKY RYAN SEVEN chased the leader early then moved up to press between rivals, lost touch around the bend and
chased three wide into the lane, then flattened out in the final furlong. EL CENTENARIO traveled near the back of the pack, went three wide into the turn,
four to five wide into the stretch and kept on through the final furlong. SALAH broke out and bumped rival, saved ground into the drive and improved
position. CHOSEN MOON settled off the inside, took the turn two wide and never threatened. MISTER STOCK off a bit slow to begin, chased two then three
wide around the turn and lacked further response. SYNSKY had early speed outside the top pair, lost ground around the turn and faded. WHERES MY
COOKIES chased four wide around the bend and had little left for the drive. SOUNDS SWEET lacked early speed, went four then three wide around the
turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
DR. TROUTMAN cleared the field early to take control, met the challenge from BORU around the far turn, dueled to the stretch, cleared rival mid-stretch
and kept to task to the wire. SEEKING REFUGE tracked two wide and between runners around the first turn, came three wide into the stretch and outkicked
BORU for the place. BORU was in range outside a rival then three deep past the half-mile pole, bid outside and dueled around the far turn and into the
stretch, could not match the winner in the final furlong and got edged for the place. SLY stalked the pace from inside then between on the backstretch,
entered the stretch two wide and lacked a serious bid. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) shifted out and bumped rival leaving the gate, settled at the back, took a
bad step leaving the far turn and kept on willingly through the final furlong. M TOWN GEM got bumped leaving the gate, raced outside rivals then off the rail,
came four wide into the stretch, altered out twice near the eighth pole and never threatened. HONOS MAN pinballed between rivals at the start, went three
wide around the first turn, moved out further on the backstretch, came five wide into the drive, was forced out by rival at the eighth pole and could not rally.
SKY CONFIDENTIAL stalked in the two path first time through the stretch then moved inside, dropped back into the far turn and was through early.
MANTRA settled inside, went between near the three-eighths, went three wide into the stretch, shifted out then pulled up in distress at the eighth pole,
crossed the wire and was vanned off.
