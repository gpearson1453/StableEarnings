TOMMY THE TORCH forced the pace inside, took over near the three eighths pole and eagerly drew away under moderate urging. STRICTLY THE BEST
lagged far behind, advanced wide into the stretch and closed well while no threat to the winner. STONEGATE settled outside, moved wide into the stretch
and flattened out. MAINE was urged just off the leaders inside and continued willingly. CATCH MY VIBE dropped back early inside, made a brief bid on the
turn then faltered. AMERICAN QUALITY flashed speed in the two path and began retreating on the turn.

Footnotes
LEGAL GUMP moved clear for half a mile, vied the remainder of the way and came again late in a game score. DANCE FOR ORO well placed inside the
dueling leaders, angled out in the stretch and rallied strongly too late. QUALITY SPECIAL engaged the pacesetter outside after half a mile, led at the quarter
pole but was outfinished. KING'S GOLD dropped back in the two path and continued willingly while no threat. SPEED SYNDROME saved ground well
behind and was never in contention. SURFER BOY GEORGE trailed early and was always outrun. CAPE MAY STYLE lacked speed and raced far back
throughout.

OFF DUTY took control at once, remained clear, widened in the stretch while kept to a drive. MUCHO MAS GRANDE bumped at the start, angled out on on
the turn and closed well. WATCH YOUR WORDS chased off the pace and continued well missing the place. DEVINE DENTAL pursued the winner
throughout and weakened late. MANAHAWKIN lacked speed and gained late wide with some energy. DELINQUENT dropped back early outside, was
blocked in mid-stretch and had no further response. GET THE W saved ground off the leaders, made a brief bid into the stretch and proved empty. JONES
TAXI lagged far behind, was taken up sharply inside at the quarter pole. TACTICAL PLAN came out bumping rival at the start, raced wide on the turn and
faded. INKY DINKY DO was urged close up wide down the backstretch and stopped abruptly.

SLINGIN SAMMY B split rivals advancing on the turn, moved wide into the stretch then surged clear in the final furlong. MADAME TIGER led inside, moved
clear on the turn but could not hold off the winner. YOUR PAL saved ground just off the leaders, bid then flattened out late. LIL MISS HOTSHOT lagged far
behind then passed rivals without menacing. LOVE ON FIRE was urged close up between rivals down the backstretch and faded. AUSSIE MIST chased
three wide for half a mile and faltered. LINDA'S BALLET prompted the pace wide to the far turn and stopped abruptly. J J LOVES BILLY raced very wide,
moved closer at the three eighths pole and gave way.

SQUAN'S KINGDOM set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way on the turn, drifted out bothering rivals entering the stretch, dug in gamely,
drifted out again past the sixteenth marker and held on. SHERO was bumped at the start, stalked close up outside, rallied outside entering the stretch, was
floated out wide by the winner, dug in gamely between rivals in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed in the photo for second. CONJECTURE steadied at
the start, raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, was floated out wide entering the stretch, dug in gamely outside rivals in the stretch run and dug in
determinedly to the wire. GYPSY JANIE raced off the pace, advanced inside on the turn, came two wide into the lane and gained mildly inside. MONACO
PRINCESS raced off the pace, chased on the turn and had no rally. HIDENSEEK SALLY tracked inside, lacked a bid and tired. SEXYAMA was bumped at
the start, raced off the rail and did not factor. ATINA SALSA dwelt at the start and was outrun. JOYCEE'S SPIRIT raced off the pace inside and did not
factor. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start and stretch run, along with a Jockey Objection by the rider of SHERO against the winner, after video
review, SQUAN'S KINGDOM was disqualified and placed third for bothering rivals in the stretch run.

MADELYN'S DANCER settled outside, advanced very wide into the stretch and surged clear through the final furlong. DONA CAMILE moved clear to mid
stretch and weakened in the final furlong. YOURINDENIAL lacked speed inside, rallied along the rail to gain the show. FOUR SEASONS GIRL lacked
speed outside, moved wider in the stretch passing rivals. CONNOISSEUR broke slowest, moved up inside then flattened out. RUNNING GIRL prompted the
pace outside for half a mile and faltered. PASATIME settled wide behind the leaders and weakened after half a mile. WOOD BEE dropped back early and
was always outrun. BETTER BEGIN trailed for half a mile then passed fading rivals. MRS. PHELPS chased off the pace between foes and gave way.
RAGAZZA CARINA saved ground in mid pack and steadily faded. PER RULING #21083PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION
