Footnotes
DESTINATIONWNRSCIR four then three wide in closest aim of the leader latched on to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, advanced to
take command at the quarter pole and spun three then two wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. STORMI CAT LADY just off the
inside early on, tipped out to chase four paths off the rail lightly coaxed along, tucked to the two path into the turn, angled out through the latter portion of the
bend nearing the quarter pole and went four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. EPONA'S
DREAM brushed the near side stall at the start, chased three then two wide, took to the rail at the three-eighths placed to coaxing, swung three wide into
upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. GALLINA hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under close attendance to
the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths as the pressure intensified, yielded the front near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper
stretch, then weakened in the drive. DUCKPHAT chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and
made no impact. QUIET TYPE five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths,
cornered three to four wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
MEBS WEB attained a forward position, stalked the frontrunners towards the three path during the run around the bend, crept up to the one to catch after
the half had been completed, was slightly closer to the rail challenging for the top in upper stretch, wasted no time taking charge, then padded the winning
margin in the last eighth. GAGLIANO remained near the rear after being one of the slowest out of the starting gate, was in the two path stepping onto the
top of the turn, fanned out into path seven from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, rallied mildly to procure the place. LOVE ME TOMORROW
disputed the pace from the two path, felt the presence of the winner late on the bend and got let out in response, proved no match, relinquishing readily,
weakened into the show slot. MAMA KIN tracked the pacesetter from just off the rail, angled three wide into the stretch, had no punch. REMOANE forwardly
placed along the inside as a pace factor for the opening half, faltered. DAZZLING SPEED worked out a tuck into the two path at the half mile pole, was
moved out five wide turning into the stretch, had no offering. SHANNON'S GIRL rode the rail until the quarter pole, tipped into the two path at the top of the
lane, wasn't making any headway at the time when the pilot lost the whip at the eighth pole.

Footnotes
PROFESSOR SNAPE got bumped and pinched at the start due to pressure from MORGANTOWN breaking inwards and was forced to be steadied off that
rival's heels conceding three lengths to the front, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming
under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the very last
jumps to score. NINTH HOUR three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch,
rallied to threaten through the final furlong loosely between foes taking command seventy yards from home, led late until nailed in the final strides to the
finish. MORGANTOWN broke in at the start bumping PROFESSOR SNAPE and pinching that rival out before taking over the lane and forcing him to steady
in behind, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair inside the final eighth, had the rider lost the handle on the whip when switching it to the near side
nearing the sixteenth pole, got collared seventy yards from home and was along clear for the show honors. DIDDLEY broke in at the start bumping SAN
JUAN DIEGO in concert with CORPORATE RAIDER who broke outwards, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside for home, kept on through to the finish but was outkicked. SAN JUAN DIEGO got bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way, chased
three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the late stages. IRISH ROAR (IRE) four then
three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. CORPORATE RAIDER broke out at the start
bumping SAN JUAN DIEGO in tandem with DIDDLEY, who broke inwards, chased along the inside coaxed along from midway on the turn, cut the corner
into upper stretch and tired.

NOT PHAR NOW remained stationed towards the two path after establishing the top under his own power, flicked off INSIDE INFO after the first fraction
had been finalized and steadily extended the advantage during the run around the bend, was in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole when switched to
stronger handling, began the last eighth leading by its largest margin, squandered nearly all of it tiring in the final seventy yards, but made it to the finish line
in time to prevail. FINANCIALSTABILITY got bumped at the start, took up the chase four wide on the turn, angled one path farther off the rail for the stretch
run, improved during the early stages of it, left the sixteenth pole and closed in belatedly on the weakening NOT PHAR NOW, only to come up short. KAZ'S
BEACH tracked NOT PHAR NOW from along the inside route, cut the corner into the lane, gained ground in the final seventy yards on a winner with
ever-dwindling energy himself in the last yards. MAGNETRON guided into the two path, pursued the top one from midpack on the turn, swung out into path
four entering the top of the lane, had no closing punch. FLEET WARRIOR stalked the winner three wide on the turn, was more in the four path entering the
lane, folded. FUTURE BOOK made contact with the second place finisher after losing his footing springing from the gate, travelled three wide on the turn,
got steered one wider for the drive, had no offering. INSIDE INFO prompted the pace three wide for nearly a half, was on empty strolling eight wide into the
lane, was allowed to fade away, kept to a protective hold.

SEARCH RESULTS away without apparent mishap, was rated along accompanying MISS BRAZIL for the opening half from the two path, spun towards
path three under a drive entering the top of the lane, battled abreast of the aforementioned rival, saw the runner up begin to drift out, got pulled slightly wider
by her pilot, attempting to avoid contact, had the twosome exchange a couple of brushes in the general area of the sixteenth pole, resulting in the
formerly-errant MISS BRAZIL assuming a truer course herself however, gamely wore down that opponent in the last jumps to prove best. MISS BRAZIL
established the top after being placed to a hand ride on the chute, was kept to it after having done so, showed the way from along the inside route,
shadowed by SEARCH RESULTS out in the two path, shifted into the two path itself when let out turning into the lane, being challenged in earnest, began to
come out in midstretch, leading to some contact between the combatants a sixteenth later, relinquished reluctantly shortly afterwards. THE GRASS IS BLUE
pursued the pace from path two, between rivals for most of the trip leading up the end of the bend, got momentarily steadied displaying some keenness right
around the five-sixteenths pole, slithered her way into path four for the stretch run, proved no match. LAOBANONAPRAYER tracked the front runners from
the pocket, was let out a notch a short distance from the quarter pole, cut the corner into the lane, failed to fire. MAKE MISCHIEF brought up the back of the
pack, was put to stronger handling crossing the midway point on the turn, got sent out six wide from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, made
no impact. MO DESSERTS forwardly placed three wide, was through after going six furlongs.

CHATEAU hustled from the gate, briefly tussled with HAPPY FARM for the front before establishing sole command, showed the way in hand along the
inside, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to the eighth pole, held clear geared down nearing the finish to prevail
comfortably. WENDELL FONG broke in at the start bumping SPEED PASS, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four
wide into upper stretch, closed well to cut into the winner's margin while along clear for the place honors. SPEED PASS broke outwards hitting the off side
stall at the start, then got bumped by WENDELL FONG who broke inwards, chased three then two wide advancing into contention half a mile from home,
chased the winner in closest aim through the turn placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, kept on one paced to the finish
while along safe for the show honors. PETE'S PLAY CALL hustled from the gate, chased inside briefly before tipping to the two path five furlongs from
home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position. HAPPY FARM hustled from the start, tussled
with CHATEAU showing brief speed before being shaken off by that rival into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths beginning to retreat, spun
three wide into upper stretch and tired. Following a shoe repair in the paddock, SHARE THE RIDE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a
ride from the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

LAKE AVENUE away in good order, made her way into the two path down the backstrech, was held in reserve taking up the chase within striking distance
of the front runners, tipped into the three path approaching the five-sixteenths pole, finished off the remainder of the run around the bend, spun into the lane
as the outermost of three front runners, took charge when given her cue at the three-sixteenths pole, drew out to a lengthy advantage before finally being
geared down for the final seventy yards. PORTAL CREEK got hustled along on the chute to establish the top, cut over the inside at the conclusion after
achieving the goal, got rated showing the way, tailed by FLASHNDYNAMITE from the outside, saw the winner arrive threateningly on the scene as
three-quarters was being completed, was let out in response to the two-pronged attack that soon followed, proved no match when the rider of the top one
went to work a few strides down the road, stayed to salvage second. FLASHNDYNAMITE stalked the pace from the two path, was between opponents
challenging for the lead stepping onto the head of the stretch, wasn't up to the task at hand and backed away. NEEDS SUPERVISION pursued the pace
from path two in midpack, angled four wide for the drive, made no headway. HALO CITY raced out in the middle of the strip on the backstretch as the early
trailer, departed it from path two, fanned out six wide from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, made no impact. LANDING ZONE sent to the rail at
the half mile pole, took it until the end of the bend, got driven into path two for entrance into the stretch, had no gain. THANKFUL took the inside route,
slipped into the three path at the three-eighths pole, was steered out five wide for the drive, failed to rally. GONE GLIMMERING pocketed, faltered.

WEYBURN reluctant to load prior to the start, broke to the front and steadily crossed to the two path to attend the leader from the outside, remained
patiently handled keeping pace given some rein to work with until placed to coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, shied
inwards nearing the eighth pole and was corrected before contact could be made with FREEDOM FIGHTER, rallied to duel through the final furlong down
along the rail with CROWDED TRADE to his outside and gamely got up in the very last jump to prevail by a sliver. CROWDED TRADE bobbled at the start,
settled four then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under light coaxing seven-sixteenths from home three wide, swung three to four wide into
upper stretch, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths, dug in coming in a path to look WEYBURN in the eye through the final furlong dueling to the
finish and was nailed in the shadow of the wire. HIGHLY MOTIVATED bobbled at the start getting away towards the rear, got placed in a bit tight by WIPE
THE SLATE near the seven-eighths pole forcing ATLANTIC ROAD to steady in behind and alter outwards, then got put in tight himself as WIPE THE
SLATE once more came inwards nearing six and a half furlongs remaining and was forced to briefly steady along the temporary rail extended from the
intersection of the clubhouse turn, lost about a length of position in total, tipped out soon after and chased three wide from mid pack, followed his barn mate
through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs out and advancing to be just off the pace swinging four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
offering up a mild kick to garner the show honors clear of the rest. FREEDOM FIGHTER established the front shortly after the start and crossed to show the
way in hand along the inside under the watchful eye of WEYBURN but facing little pressure saved that rival's presence, settled into a comfortable rhythm
and was patiently handled until nearing the quarter pole and the pressure intensified, cut the corner into upper stretch, got collared three-sixteenths out and
paused briefly in tight as WEYBURN shied in and was corrected nearing the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. THE REDS five paths off the
inside down the backstretch near the rear of the field, went four wide through the turn put to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch
and passed tired rivals to the finish. CAPO KANE just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun three wide into
upper stretch and tired. WIPE THE SLATE came over shortly after the start placing both ATLANTIC ROAD and HIGHLY MOTIVATED in tight seven
furlongs from home, then placed HIGHLY MOTIVATED in tight once more briefly nearing six and a half furlongs to go before making his way along the
inside, chased inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went three wide into upper stretch and faltered. ATLANTIC ROAD got steadied off the
heels of HIGHLY MOTIVATED seven furlongs from home when that foe was placed in tight by WIPE THE SLATE directly in front, altered out to chase four
wide, then tucked three wide five furlongs out before taking to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled out four to five
wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
IMPERIO D took up position in midpack after the field had been sent off and running, moved into the pocket coming up to the top of the turn, waited for
options beginning from the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, inched out, eventually shoe-horning himself into a snug fit on the two path, stepped into the
lane, slipped by a beleaguered COOLBOY a few strides later and was given its cue, forged to the front, extended the margin, then finished off the late
stages of the event, having been switched over to much lighter handling. THE BIG S disputed the pace as the outermost of three from path three for the
opening half, was approximately four wide when turned loose at the top of the lane, saw the winner take charge soon afterwards, failed to keep pace,
ventured onward to win place honors by a very comfortable margin. TRAPPEZE ARTIST rode the rail for the initial half, angled three wide for the drive, got
outkicked. BLUES CITY worked out a tuck into path two striking the half mile pole, kept watch on the pace from the middle of the field, swung out four wide
entering the stretch, made no headway. NUMBER ONE DILLON strung out four wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the inside,
gave way. QUINTARELLI sparred for the top from path two in between rivals for a half, appeared to poke a head in front as the half the second split was
about to be posted, got overwhelmed by severe pressure shortly afterwards, steadily backed away. BREITHORN hung out in the four path travelling on the
turn, angled six wide for the stretch drive, had no offering. COOLBOY cut over to the rail, showed the way on a short lease feeling pressure from a pair of
foes out in paths two and three themselves, yielded late on the bend, was straddling the right border of the inside route when forced to check in a bit tight as
the top one was launching his move, this occurring in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, lost any remaining interest and retreated.
COMPETITIVE HERO three wide onto the turn, displayed only brief speed.
