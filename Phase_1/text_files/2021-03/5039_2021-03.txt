Footnotes
LADY ATLANTIC tracked the leader down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, responded when driven approaching the three sixteenths, struck
the front past the furlong pole, and cleared while hand ridden from there. COOKIN ROSES broke outward, was sent to the lead, set the pace while clear in
the two path on the turn, went to a drive approaching the three sixteenths, was headed past the eighth pole, but kept on under a drive to hold the place.
APRIL'S GEM chased the leading pair down the backstretch and in the four to five path on the turn, was driven six wide in upper stretch, kept on all out
down the lane but lacked the needed kick to catch the top two. FIGHT ON PENN was wrangled to the rear early, began to rally while saving ground through
the turn, was driven inside into the lane, and weakened in the final furlong. RULER DAENERYS settled near the rear, raced in the rear flight in the six path
on the turn, had no response to a single strike of the crop in upper stretch, and was allowed to trail home.

ROAD TO QUALITY hit the gate at the break, was hustled up the rail to contest for the lead up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and continued
to duel gamely down the stretch, holding on to win by a neck. LUSCIOUS dueled for the lead from the two path up the backstretch and around the turn,
raced gamely while drifting slightly in the stretch and just missed. MISS HATTIE raced inside early, began to move up while saving ground around the far
turn and continued to gain ground on the outside in late stretch. POLLY WAR CRY raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile,
navigated the turn from the three path and improved position mildly in the final sixteenth but was outkicked. MIDNIGHT FROST chased the leaders up the
backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and faded on the rail in the stretch. RUSSIAN GYPSY trailed the field on the outside early, began to
drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and was never a factor.

STRONG WILL set the pace down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn while taking pressure from MALPAIS, was pushed along in upper stretch,
and edged clear of his foes past the furlong mark while drifting out under a drive. THE TABULATOR broke sharply, stalked outside of STRONG WILL and
MALPAIS, was pushed along in the four path on the turn and driven in upper stretch, kept on willingly but could not keep pace with STRONG WILL late.
MALPAIS broke out and bumped BULLDOG OF BERGEN in the opening strides, pressed the pace outside of STRONG WILL down the backstretch and in
the three path on the turn while racing between horses, was driven into the lane while still between foes, kept on in range until just past the furlong marker,
and weakened. TRAPPE VALLEY tracked behind the leading trio down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch,
but had no rally. BULLDOG OF BERGEN broke slightly awkwardly and was bumped by MALPAIS in the opening strides, soon trailed, saved ground through
the turn, was driven past the five sixteenths, but offered no response.

FINAL CALL raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, made his bid entering the stretch, bore out and bumped
with CAPTAIN CARNEGIE at the eighth pole, causing that rival to go down, raced on to take over with a sixteenth of a mile to go and managed to hold to his
lead to the wire. DISTINCT THUNDER chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, moved up to challenge
in upper stretch, bore in approaching the eighth pole, bumped soundly with CAPTAIN CARNEGIE, raced on to continue to gain ground on the outside but
couldn't get by in the final sixteenth. MOON FLASH led the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, continued to show the way
in upper stretch, and faded in the final furlong. A HINT OF GRAY raced at the back of pack through the opening quarter of a mile, fought his rider headed
into the far turn, trailed well behind the field while saving ground around the turn, was forced to swerve sharply at the eighth pole due to a fallen horse,
angled back in after avoiding both the horse and rider, and finished evenly. COLIDA raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the
turn in the two path, was forced to swerve sharply at the eighth pole to avoid a fallen horse and finished in the middle of the track. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE
pressed the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, moved up to challenge in upper stretch, was squeezed
and bumped soundly by the rivals to either side of him just before the eighth pole, fell, got up and ran on, and was caught by an outrider shortly after the
wire and walked off. AN INQUIRY AND OBJECTION WAS MADE INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE EIGHTH POLE. AFTER REVIEW, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED BOTH FINAL CALL AND DISTINCT THUNDER AND PLACED THEM FOURTH AND FIFTH, RESPECTIVELY, FOR INTERFERENCE.

Footnotes
TALIS PARK GRAD tracked the leading trio down the backstretch and in the three to four path on the turn, began to rally past the three eighths, engaged
outside the leading pair in upper stretch, took the lead near the three sixteenths, drove clear past the eighth pole and increased his lead while drifting out.
TOM'S LAST GENERAL settled well off the pace down the backstretch, chased in the five path on the turn, swung six wide in upper stretch, went to a drive,
responded with a rally despite drifting further out, and got up for place just in time. LONESOME DREAM attended the pace three deep down the backstretch
and around the turn, continued to press outside of VENETIAN DREAM into the lane, dug in when passed by the rallying TALIS PARK GRAD near the three
sixteenths, but proved no match past the furlong mark and lost place in the final jumps. VENETIAN DREAM set a pressured pace inside of BERACUDA
HEART and LONESOME DREAM, was headed in upper stretch, vied to midstretch but emptied out in the final furlong. DOCTOR VICTOR broke slightly out
and grazed BERACUDA HEART in the opening strides, settled in second last, saved ground through the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, and found no
rally. LINE OF DENHAMS was soon outpaced, trailed in the two to three path on the turn, was taken out and driven in the eight path in upper stretch, and
passed a tiring foe. BERACUDA HEART broke slightly in and grazed DOCTOR VICTOR in the opening strides, prompted the pace between horses, began
to weaken past the three eighths, and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
RICH E Z raced between horses in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail nearing the
five sixteenths pole, dueled down the lane and managed to keep his head in front at the wire. PISTOL BOX raced in the three path around the first turn,
trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch, was bumped slightly by
ZANFORCE passing the quarter pole, recovered to gain ground on the outside down the stretch and just missed. FORT RAMSEY raced between horses in
the two path around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, took over while racing in the two path around the far turn, was
challenged in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. FORT RIDGE saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the
inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, improved position in upper stretch and was outkicked late. SHELL FIRE saved
ground around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to race on the rail around the turn and tired in the final furlong.
DRIVER DAN raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, made a bid from the three path nearing the
three eighths pole and flattened out in the stretch. ZANFORCE raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the
pack on the outside, came around the far turn in the three path, bumped slightly with PISTOL BOX entering the stretch and made no bid from there.

LOST IN MANHATTAN tracked outside the pacesetter early, tracked the leading pair in the pocket on the turn, tipped out near the five sixteenths,
responded with a rally when driven in the six path in upper stretch, headed JETTIN OUT just inside the furlong mark, and cleared while under a drive until
the final fifty yards. JETTIN OUT hopped at the start, broke outward and grazed TRES GENERACIONES in the opening strides, chased the leading pair
early, inched forward three wide into the turn, engaged outside of MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH near the five sixteenths, vied two wide into the lane, led briefly
midstretch when the leader began to tire, proved no match for the winner, but chased on with continued interest to be safe for the place. TRES
GENERACIONES was grazed by JETTIN OUT in the opening strides, settled at the rear, trailed in the two path on the turn, swung out and was driven in the
five path in upper stretch, lacked the needed kick to challenge for the win but did pass a tiring horse late. MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH was urged for speed
inside, set the pace down the backstretch and while saving ground on the turn, was engaged by JETTIN OUT near the five sixteenths, vied inside that foe
from there and under a drive into the lane, but emptied out with a furlong remaining and weakened inside. TIME FOR THE QUARTER MILE WAS
ADJUSTED FROM WHAT IS SHOWN ON THE REPLAY TO THE ACCURATE SPLIT FOR THAT DISTANCE.

GREAT SCAT was hustled to the front right out of the gate, led the field throughout, raced in the two path around the turn, and continued to extend his lead
to the wire, winning easily. DEANO raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the three path, began his bid
approaching the five sixteenths pole and improved position in the stretch, settling for second best. MINISTER'S GLORY settled off the pace for the run up
the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and improved position on the outside in the stretch. TWO PAIR chased the leader on the outside up
the backstretch, dropped back slightly while racing in the two path around the turn and finished evenly. GIANT'S FORREST chased the frontrunner on the
inside through the opening three eighths of a mile, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. TIMINGISEVERYTHING trailed the field
up the backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch from the two path and got his neck in front of tiring horses in the final strides. FORGOT TO
FORGET raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and faded on the rail in the stretch. COUNTRY COOL swerved
out slightly leaving the gate, raced at the back of the through the opening half mile, swung out to the four path entering the stretch and was empty from
there.
