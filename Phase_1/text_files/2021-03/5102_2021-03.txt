Footnotes
AWESOME PEGASUS was on the pace inside rivals to the far turn, kicked clear nearing the lane then held the margin under steady handling in the lane.
TICKER rallied four and five wide to get nearest the winner into the lane but could not close the gap. TEXAS FUGITIVE saved ground to the far turn, angled
out to move up through the lane and gain third while no threat. NURSE KATIE stalked the leaders three and four wide but lacked a final closing run. SASSY
SAPPHIRE followed the pace three and four wide to the far turn and weakened into the lane. HOME EARLY SHIRLEY pressed outside the winner to the far
turn and weakened. HOLIDAY CHIMES vied from between rivals, checked into the far turn and dropped out through that bend. GRAM'Z DIAMOND was not
a threat. HOT HABANERO drifted out over heels through the first turn and was soon finished. MAFFIA'S BEST hesitated at the break and was always
outrun.

Footnotes
LEMONS IS GONE tracked the leader three or four wide, closed the gap as that one lost stride into the lane and wore down SENNEBEC SUMMER through
the final sixteenth. SENNEBEC SUMMER moved to a clear lead racing out from the rail, made the running throughout then drifted wide and shortened up
into the lane and could not contain the winner late. ULTRA CORDIAL settled back off the pace three wide, moved up through the far turn and rallied to gain
third. MISS CHIT followed the pace four wide and lacked a solid closing bid. STREET RINGER tucked inside on the first turn, remained in reach through the
far turn and weakened. AVABELL followed the pace four wide and tired. MISS MAGDALENA broke in a tangle and was always back. SHE GLITTERS
trailed throughout, lost contact and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
BREAKIN DAYLIGHT settled back off the pace two or three wide, rallied through the far turn to move four wide into the lane and closed determinedly late to
narrowly gain the win. WINTERS RUN dueled on the pace outside FRONT OFFICE, lost ground into the lane but rallied back late to just miss. GOOSE was
five wide in the first turn, continued just off the leaders four wide and closed but missed in the blanket finish. FRONT OFFICE dueled on the pace inside the
runnerup, briefly got clear but was outfinished for position late. NEXTPORTOFCALL saved ground and could not produce the needed late rally.
AUCTIONEER stalked the leaders three wide and weakened. CALOGERO failed to mount a bid racing three wide. STRAIT N' SILENT saved ground and
was not a factor. GOOD OLD LUNCH BOX was always back.

Footnotes
STARRING JOHN WAIN settled back off the pace outside, rallied four and five wide in the far turn to take aim turning for home and closed late to nip ALEX
OF ICE at the line. ALEX OF ICE settled off the leaders four wide, rallied clear nearing the lane then just failed to last. SIDE STREET DAVE bumped at the
start, reeled in GO GO SAMS BRO to bid into the far turn then could not sustain the run nearing the lane. L B GOLD bumped at the break, settled three
wide and lacked a rally. SWAGSATIONAL was not a threat four wide. LUCK CHECK was not a factor. GO GO SAMS BRO was bumped between rivals at
the start, soon rushed clear to open a good lead in the first turn but had nothing left going to the far turn.

Footnotes
FAYETTE WARRIOR tracked the early leaders four wide, bid through the far turn to move clear into the lane then held safe under steady handling.
BUBBAS DIXIE saved ground back off the early pace, angled through the far turn to rally four wide into the lane and closed but could not reach the winner.
ROCK CITY ROADHOG settled back off the pace three or four wide, angled six wide into the lane and rallied belatedly. DOBY tracked the pace three wide,
made a mild bid in late backstretch then weakened through the lane. DOCS HOLIDAY made the pace inside rivals and came up empty in the drive. DANCE
DOCTOR followed the pace four to five wide and failed to rally. BANANA PEPPER failed to threaten racing three wide. AWESOME EMMIT was just off the
early leader three wide, remained a factor to the stretch and weakened. SHANGHAI SKIPPER was last away and trailed.

Footnotes
CANDY WOMPUS was on the pace about the three path throughout while pressed, continued well into the lane and kicked clear under a drive. COLLINS
AVE was midpack racing three or four wide in reach, rallied through the lane and gained the place late. MY BOY LOLLIPOP was six wide in the first turn,
moved four wide to bid into the far turn but lacked a final closing run. BREAK FREE stalked the pace four wide and could not produce the needed late run.
OUTRUN THE POSSE was on the pace inside the winner early, rallied back turning for home but weakened late. SPOTITUDE settled back off the pace,
moved out and fanned seven wide into the lane and could not threaten. SMOKIN B failed to mount a bid three wide. TAYLOR'S PRINCE saved ground and
lacked a rally. HOLIDAY MAN was five wide in the first turn, bid three wide going to the far turn and weakened. FOR THE HUSTLE was not a factor.
