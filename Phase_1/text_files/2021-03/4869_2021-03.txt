Footnotes
GOING GLOBAL (IRE) angled to the inside early then moved out a bit on the backstretch, swung four wide exiting the far turn then five wide in upper
stretch, drew alongside the leader at the eighth pole, drifted inward and drew clear near the sixteenth pole and held safely late. CLOSING REMARKS
tucked inside early, saved ground off the pace then came a bit off the rail leaving the second bend, tipped out and brushed rival in upper stretch and finished
well to earn the place honors. QUATTROELLE (IRE) settled in the two path then moved out three wide, angled back to the two path around the far turn,
steered out in the drive and gained the show. SWEETEST ANGEL controlled the pace while pressured from outside, showed the way along the inside to the
stretch, shook free of rival at the top of the lane, clung to a short lead with a furlong to go and weakened. GOLDEN settled off the pace, came three wide
into the lane, brushed with rival in upper stretch and lacked a late bid. BLEU BALLON stumbled leaving the gate, prompted the pace from outside to the
stretch, lost contact with the leader at the top of the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
MASTERING threw his head at the start and came away a bit slow, chased inside then moved out into the two path around the first turn, steered out on the
second bend and came four wide into drive, bid outside the leader inside the eighth pole and proved best late. BOLD ENDEAVOR dueled outside
SHOOTERS SHOOTERS to the lane, cleared that rival in upper stretch, fought with the winner through the furlong grounds and yielded grudgingly.
KERSHAW sat off the pace three wide up the backstretch, went between rivals around the far turn then two wide into the stretch, came out some at the top
of the stretch and summoned a mild rally for the show. MULTIPLIER was unhurried in the early going and steered to the inside, saved ground throughout
then moved out into the two path in the drive and improved position. TWO THIRTY FIVE traveled three to four wide around the clubhouse turn, stayed off
the rail then went three deep around the far turn, came out and entered the drive five wide and proved no menace. SHOOTERS SHOOT dueled from inside
with BOLD ENDEAVOR to the stretch and gave way. INDIAN PEAK stalked the top pair outside a rival, traveled three wide into the far turn then angled four
wide into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
RACE JUDICATA away quickly from the gate and sped to the front, dueled for the lead from outside, pressured from both sides around the turn, put away
inner rival at the quarter pole, fought with PISTACHIO PRINCESS in the drive and gamely prevailed. PISTACHIO PRINCESS chased from outside, bid
three deep around the turn, fought with the winner through the lane, dug in late and missed. MEDUSA'S GAZE brushed with outside rival at the start,
forwardly placed along the inside, moved out into the two path around the turn, came out a bit further in the lane and finished willingly for the show honors.
OUR LITTLE TIGER chased outside a rival early, drifted out around the turn and finished evenly. ENSLEYS DREAM went up to duel for command form
inside, lost contact with rival approaching the quarter pole, saved ground into the drive and gave way. PREMIUMONSATURDAY tracked off the inside, took
the turn four wide, had the rider lose his whip past the eighth pole and never threatened. ELA CALIMERA MOU came away slow and brushed with inside
rival at the start, saved ground to the lane and was never a factor. ROYALLY COMMAND bobbled at the start, entered the turn three wide, moved to the
four path then steered back in leaving the bend and had little left for the drive.

the runner-up. BRILLIANT CUT traveled along the inside, cut the corner into the stretch, bid along the fence in the lane, fought with the winner late and
missed. DANCING CRANE shifted in and bumped rival at the start, sped clear then came in early, saved ground into the stretch, led to the eighth pole then
yielded to the top pair. SQUARED SHADY stalked the speed along the inside with a pair of rivals to the outside, moved into the two path around the turn,
chased three wide in upper stretch and needed more in deep stretch. PLUM SEXY raced near or at the back of the pack outside a rival, took the turn two or
three wide, came out into the stretch and never threatened. LITTLE VICKY stalked the pace from between foes to the stretch and weakened. FREEDOM
FLYER bothered from outside leaving the gate, stalked the leader outside a pair of rivals and came four wide into the stretch and weakened.

widened under mild hand urging and ridden out late. MEDINA SPIRIT chased three wide early then stalked off the rail, exited the far turn two wide and
bested the rest. DREAM SHAKE stalked the pace in the two path then angled in and saved ground around the far turn, chased the winner with MEDINA
SPIRIT to the outside and got outkicked for second. ROMAN CENTURIAN trailed early then passed a rival on the backstretch, went three then two wide
around the far turn and kept on for a minor share. THE GREAT ONE broke in and bumped rival, chased outside foes then came four wide into the stretch
and weakened. NONE ABOVE THE LAW bumped leaving the gate, tracked the pace from inside, saved ground into the lane and proved no menace.
GOVENOR'S PARTY took the first turn three wide, remained off the rail to the stretch, eased through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
WHISPER NOT (GB) sped clear early and opened up around the first turn, remained well clear up the backstretch, carried a comfortable lead into the drive,
urged right-handed in the final furlong and held safely. RIP CITY was closest in pursuit early, chased two wide and cut into the lead around the second turn,
whittle the gap late but could not threaten the winner. TRIPOLI raced three then two wide around the first turn, angled in a bit on the second bend and raced
a bit off the rail into the stretch and finished evenly to best the rest. TIBERIUS MERCURIUS went two to three wide around the first turn, traveled outside a
pair of rivals leaving the backstretch, entered the lane three wide and never produced a bid. GAUGUIN (GER) was unprepared, tossing his head prior to the
start then stumbled when the gates opened, trailed the field to the far turn, went around a rival then exited that bend two wide and lacked further response.
CLUB ASPEN tracked the pace from inside to the lane and lacked a rally. VANTASTIC angled in early, pulled and checked into the first turn, saved ground
to the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
BRICKYARD RIDE cleared the field to set the pace, padded the lead up the backstretch, showed the way in the two path into the drive and won easily under
left-handed encouragement. TIGRE DI SLUGO stalked off the rail, raced three wide then angled five wide into the stretch and outkicked EXAULTED for
second. EXAULTED settled off the pace, traveled four wide into the turn, angled out and exited the bend six wide, fought with TIGRE DI SLUGO in the late
stages and got outfinished for the place honors. MAJOR CABBIE got bumped from inside at the start, raced mid-pack up the backstretch and moved to the
inside, saved ground around the turn, moved into second approaching the eighth pole but flattened out in deep stretch. STORM THE COURT closest to the
leader early, went three wide around the turn and weakened. MANHATTAN UP sat at the back of the pack early inside STRONGCONSTITUTION, raced
along the rail to the turn, came out into the stretch, angled back to the inside in the lane and never threatened. STRONGCONSTITUTION traveled at the
back of the back outside a rival, entered the turn two wide then angled five wide into the stretch and was never a factor. EXTRA HOPE broke out and
bumped rival at the start, raced off the rail then angled into the two path entering the turn, steered back out and came four wide into the stretch and had little
left for the drive. LOUD MOUTH stalked outside a rival and four wide around the bend, then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
HIT THE ROAD stalked the pace from inside, waited for room in the two path leaving the far turn, bid between rivals in upper stretch and edged a pair of
foes late under a drive. SMOOTH LIKE STRAIT forwardly placed in the two path, bid outside around the far turn, gained command in upper stretch,
challenged from both sides in the final furlong and finished gamely to the wire. COUNT AGAIN traveled at the back of the pack outside a rival, went three
wide into the lane, angled widest in the stretch and was closing fast. FLAVIUS stalked outside a rival then exited the far turn three wide, bid four wide in
upper stretch but got outkicked. ROYAL SHIP (BRZ) chased two wide through both turns, produced a late effort and finished well to the wire. CASA CREED
tracked the speed outside a rival, went three wide into the drive, finished willingly but needed more late. RIDE A COMET bumped with outside rival at the
start, sat off the pace from off the inside, went three to four wide into the stretch, tipped out and lacked a rally. SPIRIT ANIMAL reserved in the early going
and angled to the inside, steered out in upper stretch and never made an impact. FLYING SCOTSMAN bumped with rival at the start, sent for the lead from
outside, cleared and crossed over to the inside, challenged around the far turn and fought back from inside, lost command in upper stretch and gave way in
the final furlong. SOCIAL PARANOIA tracked the speed along the fence, entered the stretch two wide and weakened.

INDEPENDENCE HALL rank into the first turn, stalked along the inside then moved out and exited the far turn three wide, chased within striking distance
through the lane and got edged for the show. TIZAMAGICIAN checked behind the leader and altered out into the first turn, stalked off the rail then bid
between rivals into the second turn, led briefly then lost command, chased the the leader into the drive and weakened. KISS TODAY GOODBYE unhurried
in the early going, entered the stretch four to five wide and never made an impact. COASTAL DEFENSE traveled off the inside then shifted in nearing the
first turn, moved out into the two path and remained there to the stretch and weakened. KING GUILLERMO away quickly from the far outside, sped to the
