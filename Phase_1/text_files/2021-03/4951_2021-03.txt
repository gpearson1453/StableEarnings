Footnotes
SWEET GIANT, forwardly placed four wide attending the pace to the backstretch, was urged to press the leaders three deep entering the far turn, shifted in
dueling for command outside a rival into upper stretch and edged forward late under firm encouragement. ROGUE RAGE broke sharply, was urged along
the rail prompting a rival's pace into the backstretch, tracked just off that foe to the second bend, was urged to advance along the rail, then steadied out of
tight quarters racing past the three furlong marker, drove through to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, couldn't match the winner late and was
taken in hand approaching the wire while narrowly prevailing for the place honors. ALPERES was rated off the first flight a bit off the inside racing to the
backstretch, angled inwards after a half to race along the rail into the second bend, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued willingly in that
path to close the gap on the top pair. BELLAMY'S TREASURE, bumped by GARNETT at the start, tracked the leaders three deep as part of the second
flight racing to the far turn but had no closing bid. GARNETT broke outwards bumping a rival, angled to the inside dropping off the second flight racing to the
backstretch, switched out after a half to race four deep to the second bend and steadily faded. REACTION TIME angled inwards while being urged to the
lead between foes dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing to the backstretch, briefly resisted when challenged by the top pair but gave way into upper
stretch. CUP GAME, off slowly, shifted outside foes racing to the first turn, was caught five wide racing through the backstretch and proved no threat.
SMART SOLDIER flashed brief pace three wide between foes racing to the backstretch but was finished early.

Footnotes
CALL ME HANDSOME broke inwards while gaining a forward placing along the rail, attended the pace inside rivals racing into the turn, was urged to
advance inside the pacesetter challenging for command nearing upper stretch, then gradually drew on terms and edged that foe nearing the wire under firm
right handed pressure in a prolonged drive. TIZ APPROVED was urged to dictate the pace between foes from the outset on a narrow advantage racing into
the turn, came under pressure to resist the winner's challenge racing through the stretch and contested the issue grudgingly to the end. INDY RIDE tracked
off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch losing ground to the first flight but continued with interest to edge a rival for a share.
ROCKYSBUCKAROO, in touch with the first flight three deep prompting the pace into the turn, steadily faded into upper stretch. STEEL SHOT tracked off
the first flight racing four wide to the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. SAY ADIOS tracked off the first flight, between foes, dropped back entering
the turn, angled to the inside nearing the lane but lacked a rally. TWIN VALOR, off slowly, trailed throughout.

WAR GIANT raced between foes within striking distance attending the pace, angled to the rail nearing the turn while being prompted to advance, readily
wrested the advantage nearing upper stretch, then went clear through the stretch while being kept to firm right handed encouragement. SOUR KICKS, in
touch with the first flight four wide in the opening stages, was urged to press the issue racing three deep into the turn, couldn't match terms with the winner
after a half but proved best of the others. ARRIVEDERLA ducked in sharply at the start while breaking last, was settled along the inside dropping off the
field, saved ground to upper stretch and advanced inside foes in the closing stages to prevail for a share. PERFETTO vied three deep between foes in the
opening stages, dropped back entering the turn, angled nearing the inside racing into upper stretch and made an effort to regain some position while no real
threat. SIX CIDER broke slowly, angled inside foes while making brief progress entering the turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch and quickly came up
empty. SIESTA MOON, in touch between foes in the first flight in the opening furlong, was eased back while switching out four wide racing into the turn and
steadily faded into the lane. HARD WEST was urged inside foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing through the backstretch, shifted a bit off
the rail dueling for command between foes entering the turn and gave way leaving midstretch.

Footnotes
THUNDER BUGGY sprinted to the lead along the rail leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, held sway to upper stretch,
widened the advantage under firm pressure past midstretch and was taken in hand nearing the wire while proving best. GOODBYE CAROLINA, carried
inwards by GONE DREAMING leaving the chute, then taken up off that rival, was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, switched out
to gain position between foes advancing on the pacesetter nearing upper stretch but proved only second best. AGELESS ARTIST settled along the inside in
the opening half, saved ground through the far turn to upper stretch and continued to improve position while finishing on even terms with a rival for a share.
PRETTY PRINCESS, reserved between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to split foes gaining position on the far turn, angled
out four wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to finish on even terms with a rival for a share. VISIBLY was held up while switching outside foes in
the last flight racing three deep to the backstretch, continued outside foes on the far turn, was fanned four wide into the lane and lacked the needed late
response. D FLAT WHITE, restless in the gate, reared at the start losing position to the field, settled into stride and made the most of a ground saving trip to
pass inside tiring rivals late. BARREL OF BLISS, urged to a forward placing outside a rival tracking the pacesetter to the backstretch, continued in pursuit of
the leader along the inside into the far turn and gave way into the stretch. ROYAL GOLD DIGGER tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the
backstretch, made brief progress three deep racing into the far turn, but bore out abruptly racing past the quarter mile marker while quickly giving way.
GONE DREAMING shied inwards racing through the chute making some contact with GOODBYE CAROLINA, shifted to the inside racing into the first turn
tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight while rank under restraint and dropped back after a half. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
MAMA MAY I, off a step slow, was prompted to gain a position between foes in second flight racing through the backstretch, shifted out four wide on the turn
advancing on the first flight, moved to challenge three deep nearing midstretch and wrested the advantage late under firm encouragement. BEND THE
KNEE tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening quarter, split foes just off the inside nearing upper stretch to bid for command along the rail
nearing midstretch but proved only second best. LA LUISA vied for command three wide between foes through the backstretch, edged away to a clear
advantage nearing upper stretch, resisted challenges while between foes to late stages but yielded to the top pair late. GRANDMARY, slow into stride,
angled to the inside racing into the turn, steadily gathered momentum nearing upper stretch, then shifted out three wide in the closing stages improving her
position to the end. PRINCESS RENEE bobbled just after the start, was settled off the second flight, angled outside foes racing into the turn and continued
five wide to the lane while gaining position to late stages. MEANASASNAKE joined the pace four wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue three wide
racing into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. BOURN WILD AGAIN tracked the leaders four wide in second flight early and faded racing into the
turn. RUN AWESOME TIZ, urged inside foes prompting the pace in the opening stages, shifted out to race between foes entering the turn and steadily
faded in the final stages. DINNER FOR TWO, urged between foes disputing the pace, then along the inside racing into the turn, gave way into upper stretch.
SENORITA AURORA, away slowly, proved no threat. CASARENA HOTTIE broke very slowly losing position to the field and trailed to the stretch. RUN
SNIP RUN tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CLADDAGH'S RUN, reserved well back racing to the first turn, switched outside foes racing into the backstretch, was caught five wide racing past the half
mile marker, continued with a steady advance three deep on the far turn to challenge for command in upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and went
clear under firm left handed pressure. REAL WILD SOLUTION angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, saved ground on the far
turn, swung outside foes racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to edge a rival for the place honors. EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE broke
sharply, angled to the rail setting the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the backstretch, maintained that margin to upper stretch, briefly resisted the
winner's bid but weakened late. SLEWYS CHOSEN ONE, forwardly placed tracking just outside the pacesetter in the opening half, was urged to challenge
between foes nearing upper stretch and finished evenly between rivals in late stages. HOITY TOITY tracked off the second flight along the inside, saved
ground to upper stretch and gained some position in an even effort. BROADWAY PEGGY tracked the pace outside a rival in second flight was prompted to
advance between foes into the far turn, angled inside nearing upper stretch but had no closing bid. STONEY'S MONKEY broke awkwardly, settled last to
the backstretch and never gained contention. TIZ HERSELF settled between foes in the last flight and dropped out early. KELCIE'S MANDATE switched out
three deep tracking of the second flight, continued four wide between foes through the backstretch and steadily faded outside foes on the far turn. WILD
NORTH, reserved along the inside early, was prompted to make some brief progress between foes after a half but came up empty racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
MARIALUISA, caught in tight quarters at the start, angled to the rail dropping off the second flight, was prompted to make a steady advance inside foes
racing to the backstretch, came through tight quarters entering the far turn to bid for command along the rail, wrested the advantage and went well clear
under firm encouragement. CSILLA switched off the inside racing to the backstretch tracking the leaders between foes in second flight, gained position three
deep between foes and prevailed for the place honors late despite her rider having his whip struck from his hand in the drive. R D BLESSING settled
between foes racing behind the second flight in early stages, split rivals near the inside racing through the far turn to gain position nearing upper stretch and
was just outkicked for second. KAUFY FUTURES, caught four wide to the backstretch tracking the leaders in second flight, continued four wide through the
far turn to upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. SHARON'S LAW angled inwards forcing the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, dueled
for command between foes into the far turn and gave way nearing midstretch. HONESTA settled outside foes in the last flight early, was fanned five wide
into upper stretch and proved no threat. MARIANNA QUEEN tracked the leaders three wide between foes in second flight in the opening half, was prompted
to make a brief advance in that path entering the far turn but emptied out nearing upper stretch. WRITTEN IN RED settled last and proved no threat.
LASTING JOY made brief pursuit of the leaders along the inside but gave way early. AMBER PRINCESS vied for command between foes then along the
inside racing to the backstretch but was finished after a half while his rider was observed to have returned without a whip.

encouragement. QUALITY STEP was settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, swung outside foes on the far turn to advance five
wide into upper stretch, shifted inwards under pressure racing through the lane but edged a rival for the place honors. ATONE was rated off the first flight
along the inside racing to the far turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch while awaiting an opening, then was outkicked for second in late stages. GRAND
JOURNEY was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch to gain some position three
wide between rivals while racing in close quarters but lacked the needed late kick. LORD BARNA settled last near the inside racing to the far turn, angled
out five wide in upper stretch and gained some position while making no real impression. CURRENT was rated off the second flight outside a rival in the
opening half, was prompted to advance while caught four wide between foes nearing upper stretch, then was taken up out of tight quarters in upper stretch

Footnotes
SAVED AT THE WIRE tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside in the second quarter gaining a position just off the
leaders, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, split rivals to bid inside the leaders entering upper stretch and went clear in the closing stages
under firm encouragement. BODACIOUS BLEND, bumped at the start while forced into the path of VAN KHOZAN, was switched out five wide racing
through the backstretch, continued to make steady progress in that path racing through the turn to upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors. FIRST
GOLD, forwardly placed four wide in the opening stages, shifted in to press the pace three wide between foes to strike the front racing into upper stretch but
yielded to the top pair late. NAVAL WAVE, bumped by LADY CHITU at the start while forced into BODACIOUS BLEND, switched out four wide while
prompted to advance on the first flight racing through the backstretch, gained position four wide between foes racing into upper stretch but flattened out late.
INDY FRONT, prominent outside foes in the opening stages, shifted in to press the pace between foes racing into the turn and gave way into upper stretch.
VAN KHOZAN, bumped at the start, shifted out to track off the second flight between foes racing into the turn but lacked a closing response. CLAP FOR ME
settled between foes in early stages and failed to menace. PRETTY PRISCILLA dropped out early. SMOOTH DANCER angled to the inside after the
opening furlong disputing the pace inside foes racing into the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. LADY CHITU broke inwards bumping NAVAL WAVE
and forcing that rival inwards bumping rivals, angled to the rail early and soon retreated.

Footnotes
SIFTING SANDS (GB) angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking just off the first flight, continued under light rating to the backstretch, saved ground
on the far turn, then came through inside foes when presented an opening in upper stretch to wrest the advantage and hold DANCE SOME MO to the end
under firm handling. The latter, bumped at the start, was quickly righted to attend the pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the leader on the far turn, was
carried out by that foe into upper stretch but continued willingly to contest the issue to the end. AMERICAN DIAMOND settled outside foes racing to the
backstretch, advanced to contention four wide after a half, continued three deep on the far turn while moving to challenge nearing upper stretch, was floated
out entering the lane but continued well enough to edge a rival for a share late. HARD KNOCKING swerved out at the break bumping DANCE SOME MO,
was righted, then urged along the rail setting the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, dueled inside foes on the far turn, drifted out racing into upper
stretch and gave way. STAND WITH MO angled inwards to track the leaders between foes in second flight, was prompted to advance but couldn't make an
impression on the leaders while shifting out four wide in the closing stages. DANCE PANTS hopped, then was held up out of tight quarters at the start,
settled off the second flight racing to the far turn, was fanned five wide into the stretch and failed to menace. HABITUS was rated off the second flight along
the inside racing to the far turn but offered no rally. SALTY CANDY tracked the leaders three deep in second flight in the opening half, was fanned four wide
nearing upper stretch and quickly came up empty. WELL TOLD, reserved along the inside, dropped out early. COMMANDER KEITH ducked in at the start
while breaking last, trailed the field to the backstretch, was outdistanced into the stretch but walked off the course under his own power.
