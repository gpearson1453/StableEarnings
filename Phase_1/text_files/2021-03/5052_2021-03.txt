rally. BENITO CHICO raced in mid pack early, went eight wide through the turn and never fired. BOISTEROUS RASCAL was allowed to settle early, angled
out between rivals in early stretch and weakened. RUNNERATTHECORNER set a pressured early pace, went three wide into the turn and faded. TUONO

Footnotes
MONUMENTAL SEVEN stalked the early pace, raced along the inside into the home turn, angled out in early stretch, found room, was gaining late, drifted
out late and was up in time for the win. AVALON KING set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail through both turns, drifted out late, couldn't hold off the
winner and just missed. BROZILIAN (BRZ) was taken back early, advanced eight wide through the second turn, was closing late, was carried out late
stretch by the top two finishers and needed more ground. FISHEL was void of speed, went seven wide through the second turn, angled in late and finished
evenly late. COOL HAND LUCAS was unhurried early, raced along the inside into the home turn, angled out and flattened out. CAPTIVE KITTEN raced in
mid pack early, went five wide into the second turn and was empty late. BEA'S BOY was unhurried early, raced along the inside into the home turn and
never fired. MO GEE pressed the early pace, raced three wide into the second turn and gave way. INDIAN HEAD NICKLE was up close, went four wide into
the second turn and faded. FLASH OF GLORY was reserved early and retreated.
