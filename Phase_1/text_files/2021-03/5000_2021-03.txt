Footnotes
MAW MAW'S SOPHIA was coaxed along at the rear of the field, went three wide early on the turn, moved to four then five wide while striding forward in the
vicinity of the five-sixteenths, rallied outside into the stretch, closed strongly while still on her inside lead, gained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole
then moved clear, swapped to the proper lead about seventy yards from the wire and prevailed under steady urging. JUANANDORA was urged along off
the pace, went around the turn in the two path, turned into the stretch under a drive, pursued the leader into the final furlong, moved out approaching the
sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the place. GOODNIGHT GRACIE was last to commence, settled towards the rear, raced inside early on the turn then
shifted three wide, moved four wide later on that bend, was driven five wide into the stretch and improved position for the show. GLITTER TIME was away
alertly, showed the way down the backstretch, drew off while inside on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, remained on her inside lead while put to the
crop in upper stretch, shortened stride into the final furlong then was overtaken while faltering. LIL' SISTER LOU dropped off the pace then moved out
midway down the backstretch, went four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. TUFFOLOGY came in early then was taken in hand and
dropped back some, raced on the outside under some urging, went around the turn in the two path and faltered. SAY YES AGAIN broke out at the start,
chased the pace on the outside, came up empty in the three path on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
ORB'S SOUL was bumped at the start, went clear early then drew off on the inside, opened up a sizable advantage while traveling comfortably, saw the
lead diminish while patiently handled on the far turn, responded well when asked outside the three-sixteenths and drew off while kept to the task in a
dominant victory. MALARTACH raced inside on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while saving ground on the far turn and safely secured
the place while no threat to the winner. STAR'S DREAM went three wide on the first turn, settled well behind the solo leader, was urged along in the two
path on the far turn and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. DORI'S BIRDIES broke out and bumped with a foe, went around the first
turn in the two path, settled well back in the field, saved ground on the far turn and failed to threaten. TUPELO HON E was taken up between horses early,
went four wide on the first turn, was urged along while outside on the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed
to respond. MEG AND CLAIR went five wide on the first turn, raced well back in the field, went three then four wide on the turn and showed little. SMART
PEGASUS was taken in hand early, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped back under urging leaving the backstretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MONARCHOS PRAYER angled in quickly while going to the front, set the pace while coming under pressure from the outside, vied inside to the two path on
the turn, dueled with the runner-up in the stretch, brushed with that foe near the eighth-pole, drifted out some while digging in determinedly in the final
furlong and narrowly prevailed. STELLA'S SURPRISE showed early speed then was switched out behind the winner, moved up to dispute the pace on the
outside, vied two to three wide on the turn, dueled outside of the winner in the stretch, brushed with that foe near the eighth-pole, fought gamely in the final
furlong and just missed while narrowly able to get the place. SASSY MALLORY settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, rallied along the rail in the
stretch and closed strongly to just miss while able to get the show. C'ESTBON C'ESTBON broke a bit awkwardly then was forced in, raced on the outside
while ridden along, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under a drive, rallied into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and
finished willingly but missed the trifecta. SUCRE was forced in at the start then bumped with a foe, chased the pace down the backstretch, went two then
three wide on the turn, gained in the final furlong and finished willingly but was out-kicked. LUCKY LINZ broke in at the start, settled off the pace, went three
wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, steadied outside the three-sixteenths then altered in, altered out near the furlong marker and lacked the
needed kick. THAT'S A SONG bumped with a rival at the start after being reluctant to load, was forced in then checked, spotted the front several lengths,
went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
SMILING SILAS saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace, ranged up while shifting from the inside to the two path on the far turn, made a bid
nearing the five-sixteenths, took over into upper stretch and drew away under steady urging. ANICLUDE was hustled from the start, raced in the two path on
the first turn, contested the pace, vied inside on the far turn, was asked under threat from the winner coming to the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into
upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. WHISKEY PLANK went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked while
dropping from four to three wide on the far turn, chased into upper stretch, dropped back passing the three-sixteenths, had the rider lose his crop coming to
the furlong marker and came up empty while best of the rest. MANGO TREE bumped with a rival just after the start, bumped with that same foe early, went
five wide on the first turn, dropped back on the backstretch, went five wide on the far turn and faltered. TAPIT'S TEMPLE brushed the inside of the gate at
the start then was hustled, bumped with a rival shortly thereafter then was taken under a strong hold, bumped again with that foe while coming out into the
first turn, went four wide on that bend, moved up to contest the pace on the outside, came up empty in the three path on the far turn and stopped.

EUPHORIC broke in but was away clearly in front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, responded well
when asked in upper stretch, drew off under a strong hand ride into the final sixteenth then was placed under lighter encouragement while much the best.
MALLOY was recalcitrant behind the gate and reluctant to load, chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a
drive into the upper stretch and proved no match while just able to get the place. MAKEAJOYFULNOISE settled at the rear of the field, saved ground on the
turn, gained coming to the quarter-pole, was put to a drive in upper stretch and just missed the place while clear for the show. MALIBU BIRD was urged
along in third position, started the turn in the two path, shifted three around the three-eighths then four wide, turned into upper stretch under a drive then
moved out a path and came up empty. COEUR was taken up near the five-eighths then moved out, went four to five wide on the turn and faltered.

YES IT'S GINGER was hustled to the lead, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when asked coming to the three-sixteenths,
remained clear under a right-handed crop into the final sixteenth then drifted out when switched to a left-handed crop and just held under strong urging.
CHANGE OF CONTROL was urged along off the pace, raced inside early on the turn, shifted three wide outside the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the
stretch, chased the winner on the outside, gained on that foe late and just missed while able to get the place. SUNNY DALE tracked the pace on the outside
then four wide on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong, steadied when that foe drifted out late and was clear
for the show. STERLING MISS was last to commence, settled at the rear of the field, went around the turn in the two path, was roused while swinging six
wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SAINT MOON chased the pace down the backstretch, went three wide early on the turn then
dropped to the rail, fell to the rear in upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
VERB tracked the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, was asked four wide into the stretch, rallied to the lead inside the three-sixteenths, shook
clear into the final furlong then drifted in closer to the rail, raced under a drive into the final sixteenth then was eased up some while much the best. ABOUT
OUR TIME was hustled to the lead, went around the turn in the two path, was asked in the three path into the stretch, lost the advantage to the winner
inside the three-sixteenths and proved no match while clear for the place. CHARGE THE LINE was carried in early, settled off the pace, went three wide on
the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. LAND MARK DEAL was well placed towards the front,
saved ground on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. ELUSIVE D'ORO was taken up while tossing his head midway down the
backstretch, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. PERUVIAN BOY broke a step slow, raced well back in the field, went two to three wide on the
turn and was no factor. NICE WORK broke a step slow, moved up on the outside then stalked the pace, went four wide on the turn, was roused outside the
five-sixteenths, chased five wide into the stretch and capitulated. TAKAFUMI (BRZ) was carried in early, settled towards the rear, went four wide under
urging on the turn then came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
ORETTA was sent hard from the start, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the four path on the turn then was roused five wide at the
quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and proved best under steady urging. LOULEIGH brushed with a rival at the start, settled on the outside, went
four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, chased the winner in the drive and was second best. CHELSEA BRIDGE broke in and brushed the
gate but came out near the front, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and
weakened but held the show. THERUNAWAYCAMP broke out and brushed with a rival, was taken in hand early then settled off the pace, came under
urging in the three path on the turn, was driven seven wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. AMOREENA STAR was rated off the pace,
went two then three wide on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, shifted four wide into the stretch then was put to a drive around the
three-sixteenths and came up empty. HEY GRACE broke out at the start, lacked early speed, angled in at the rear near the half-mile pole, saved ground on
the turn, moved out in upper stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole and was no factor. WHOLESHACKSHIMMIES was hustled from the start, disputed
the pace on the inside of a rival while along the rail, dropped back in upper stretch and stopped.
