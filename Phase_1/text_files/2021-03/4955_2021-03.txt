Footnotes
MAINTAINANCE MATT tracked the pace on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, made a bid at the
quarter-pole then took the lead into upper stretch, responded well to the challenge of the runner-up into the final furlong and prevailed under steady urging.
TWILIGHT FANTASY broke a half-step slow and was last to commence, raced on the outside while urged along, chased four to five wide on the turn,
gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch, fought with the winner into the final furlong then was outfinished while clear for the place. FLASHYBOY
BOBB moved up to get the lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, moved clear while inside to the two path on the turn, was headed into upper
stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened while able to get the show. HOMELAND MESSA broke a half-step slow, moved in while coaxed
along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, shifted out while put to a drive in upper stretch, moved further out at the furlong marker and lacked the needed
kick. CAEUS IN PASADENA was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, angled out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten.
GRAND OMEGA pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, dropped back while two to three wide on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
SPYCRAFT showed good speed, set the clear pace, raced inside on the turn, floated out into upper stretch, responded well in the final furlong and proved
best under steady urging. VERIFIED was hustled from the start, settled on the outside, dropped in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was
put to a drive in upper stretch, chased the winner in the final furlong and was second best. BIARRITZ was hustled from the start then forwardly placed on
the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, moved in behind a drifting foe at the three-eighths, went three wide for most of the turn then shifted five
wide, came six wide into the stretch then drifted further out and lacked the needed response. HOOPERDRIVESTHBOAT tracked the pace down the
backstretch, began to lug out near the seven-sixteenths, went four wide while lugging out under heavy left-rein pressure on the turn and tired. MASTER
GUNS bumped multiple times with a foe early, settled at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted out inside the
furlong marker and failed to rally. THIRTYMINUTEMASS bumped multiple times with an opponent early then dropped back, lugged out a bit leaving the
backstretch, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. DA GOLD ROOM was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, came out leaving
the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond. (Rail at 25 Feet)

Footnotes
BUCKY angled in while going to the front, was well rated while setting the pace in the two path, controlled the action through the far turn, responded well
when set down in upper stretch, maintained a direct course in the two path as the runner-up made an inside bid coming the furlong marker, went clear when
that foe steadied near the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under good handling. TRIVISTA saved ground on the first turn, took an awkward stride against the
rail inside the three-quarter pole, was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, made a rail bid inside the
winner outside the furlong marker, steadied around the sixteenth-pole then altered to the outside and just held the place. EKATERINOSLAV went three wide
on the first turn, was rated off the pace under snug restraint, rounded the far turn in the two path while still under restraint, waited into upper stretch then was
asked while getting room at the three-sixteenths, chased the top two in the final furlong and finished willingly to just miss the place. MUSCADINE bumped
with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, went three to four wide on the far turn, was roused into the stretch and
came up empty. HERO OF THE HOUR was bumped at the start and forced into another foe, went four wide on the first turn, prompted the pace while
loosely between horses, was urged along in the three path on the far turn, came under the crop around the five-sixteenths and tired. AFLEET ROGER broke
out and bumped with an opponent, went two to three wide on the first turn, raced under a tight hold onto the backstretch then was reserved at the rear, went
around most of the far turn in the two path then shifted three wide, swung six wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. HUMPHREY went five wide on
the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the five path on the far turn, spun six wide into the stretch under a drive and capitulated.

the back of the field, went two to three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, rallied into the final furlong, angled out while gaining fast
coming to the sixteenth-pole, altered out from behind horses shortly thereafter and lost momentum but got up for the place. ALTERED DREAM settled off
the pace, moved in late on the backstretch, was roused in the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, chased in the drive and finished
willingly to get the show. D'WILD MUFFIN bumped with a rival near the five-eighths then checked, moved out before the half-mile pole, chased three wide
on the turn, took the lead into the final furlong but was overtaken then lost the show. BECCA'S WHISPER broke a step slow, raced well back in the field,
saved ground on the turn, came off the rail in upper stretch, drifted out into the final furlong, moved further out around the sixteenth-pole and improved
position. OVER THE BLUES showed good speed, moved clear outside the half-mile pole, raced inside on the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch,
lost the lead into the final furlong and weakened. KENAI COOL moved out significantly near the five-eighths, went three then four wide on the turn, was

the lead outside the quarter-pole, moved clear while four wide into upper stretch, drew away into the final furlong and proved much the best under steady

Footnotes
VEHEMENT settled just off the pace on the outside, went three wide on the turn, rallied to make a bid in upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and
prevailed under steady urging. ON THE MUSCLE bumped lightly with a rival at the start, was urged along towards the rear, went three to four wide on the
turn, came six wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the place. SKIP THE SMALLTALK was urged along off the pace, lost action leaving the
backstretch then checked while lugging out, went two to three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch under the crop and lacked the needed
kick while just able to get the show. SUMMER TUNE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced at the rear, dropped from the two path to the
rail early on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths and improved position to just miss the show.
BREEZY MONEY broke a bit slow while bumping lightly with a foe then was taken up, settled on the outside, bore out badly into the turn then checked
sharply while getting out near the outside fence, dropped to the five path before the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
SUGGESTED was coaxed along in the second flight, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path while behind horses, moved out while
put to a drive around the three-sixteenths and came up empty. KEEP A EYE ON MIKE pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn,
took the lead at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and tired. CLEARLY MAD set the pace under pressure to his outside,
vied along the rail on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch and capitulated. BOORNAZIAN settled on the
outside, bolted to the outside fence on the turn and was eased but walked off. (Rail at 25 Feet)

Footnotes
G DON'T KNOW was well placed just off the pace, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch then was put
to a drive, rallied to the lead inside the three-sixteenths, battled outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. PERFECT
PERIGEE was hustled to the lead, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path while still inside that foe on the turn, came under a drive
in upper stretch, drifted out nearing the eighth-pole, fought on well with the winner in the final furlong but missed while able to get the place. SHACKLE THE
GOLD came outward early, settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the turn and finished willingly for the show. CALLINGINTHENIGHT broke a step
slow, steadied very briefly when SHACKLE THE GOLD came out early, settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and improved position.
MIDNIGHT SPIRIT broke awkwardly and was off slow, settled at the rear, moved from three to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and also
improved position. HEREWECOMETOGETYOU broke a step slow, settled on the outside, was urged four then five wide on the turn, gained into the stretch,
chased into the final furlong then weakened. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back
into the final furlong and tired. HARPER'S DEELITE broke in and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, went four wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch and was no factor. MAKATI PHIL broke a step slow, was urged along on the outside, chased four wide on the turn and came up empty.
