KING OF CANDY contested the early lead outside HYPER DRIVE, moved clear in the second turn and drew off then continued in hand through the lane as
much best. PANIC BUTTON followed the pace while saving ground behind the top pair and gained the place in the lane. AFFIX was angled out turning into
the backstretch, moved up going to the far turn then continued on to gain the show. GOLDEN BULLET iimproved position four wide while not a threat.
HYPER DRIVE contested the pace inside the winner for a half, continued to chase nearest that one to the lane and tired. CHUCKMATE was not a factor.
CLEAR THE NILE followed the pace two or three wide and tired.

Footnotes
IT IS DEJAVU stalked the early pace inside, challenged into the far turn to bid clear turning for home and drew off under steady handling. BANDWIDTH
saved ground just off the early leaders, challenged through the far turn to get nearest the winner but could not go with that one while holding the place late.
FAITHFUL NEIGHBOR stalked the leaders four wide and made a mild bid at the place. LONESOME HIGHWAY settled back and angled in through the first
turn, rallied through the far turn but could not gain further in the lane. HOT BLOODED SONG was caught in tight passing under the wire the first turn,
followed the pace three wide, angled five wide into the lane but could not threaten late. DREAM BABY DREAM stalked the leaders four wide and failed to
mount a bid. GREEN CARD was on the pace about the three path and tired nearing the lane. MR MIDTOWN showed brief speed three wide and tired.
WILLOWY DANSEUR was always back. FULKERSON was not a factor.

Footnotes
PORSUMSUGARONME settled back off the leaders into the first turn, rallied four wide on the far turn to bid into the lane and was slowly edging clear. DIXIE
CHIP dueled from inside rivals on the pace, was topped into the lane but held well and kept the place late. IMPASSION pressed the pace three wide to bid
into the lane and show in front but could not handle the top pair late. SHELL LOCKET angled out heading up the backstretch, rallied in the far turn and
continued with a mild run late. SHAY'S GLORY was in reach four wide but lacked a final closing bid. SWEATY BETTY was with the early lead inside and
weakened. VICTORY ROSE was shuffled back at the break then was always back while fanned six wide into the lane. COMEONRILEY saved ground and
was not a factor. SUDDEN LIGHT was not a threat. SYDNEY ELIZABETH contested the pace between rivals and gave3 way in the far turn.
