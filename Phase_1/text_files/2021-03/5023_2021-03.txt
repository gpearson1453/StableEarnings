PASCAL CHANT chased the pace outside FERNWOOD DRIVE, overtook that one turning for home, drifted out in the drive and edged clear. JUSTICE OF
WAR , four deep on the turn, challenged for the lead outside PASCAL CHANT in mid stretch then flattened out. OUTSIDE THE BOX , four deep leaving the
turn, passed tired horses. SING A VERSE hugged the inner rail throughout, had a mild move to the eighth pole and flattened out. TAPPAHANNOCK raced
in the three path between horses on the turn and weakened. TIZ AUCTION TIME , steadied along the inner rail near the three eighths pole, was in hand
behind foes in upper stretch and failed to rally. FERNWOOD DRIVE sprinted to the early lead, angled over mid way down the backstretch, set the pace
along the rail around the turn and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BALLIVOR hesitated at the break, swung to the five path in upper stretch, closed relentlessly outside horses, drifted in late and was up approaching the
wire. FIVE CARD DRAW saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, eased out to the two path in upper stretch, gained the lead near the sixteenth pole and
gave way grudgingly. JUST KIDDING , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, had aim on the lead in mid stretch and flattened out. NO MORE TALK ,
three wide leaving the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and lacked the necessary rally. CANDYGRAMFORMONGO , rank leaving the starting
gate, accelerated to the early lead, set the pace near the rail and gave way the final eighth of a mile.

Footnotes
PETES PRIDE stalked the duel near the rail around the turn, eased out to the three path when set down in upper stretch, moved up outside horses to take
the lead near the sixteenth pole then drove clear. CONGRESS HALL disputed the pace between horses through out in a game performance. SCAMPER
ALONG showed speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace throughout and weakened late. ARBUTUS lacked speed, raced near the inner rail around the
turn and failed to rally. DRIVE IN , three deep disputing the pace around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened. DON'TBAGGAGECHECK
hopped at the break, steadied in traffic leaving the backstretch, circled the turn three wide and was never a factor. PERFECT EXCHANGE raced in the two
path on the turn and gave way.

DOUBLEOSEVEN , two wide prompting the pace around the turn, drew alongside ESCAPABILITY near the sixteenth pole and prevailed in an extended
drive. ESCAPABILITY accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, dug in tenaciously in the drive and was not quite good enough. SUE LOVES
BARBADOS bumped with GOLDEN GULLEY leaving the starting gate, moved up three deep leaving the turn and flattened out. PALATIAL TIMES lacked
speed, drifted to the four path entering the stretch and failed to rally. GOLDEN GULLEY bumped SUE LOVES BARBADOS when bearing out at the break,
was fanned five deep entering the stretch and failed to be a factor. SILENT SERVICE , a forward factor along the inner rail, chased the pace to the stretch
then faded. CLAW , outrun, raced along the inner rail on the turn.

not a factor and brushed with SHANGHAI SUPERFLY near the sixteenth pole. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY , no factor outside TORCH OF TRUTH, brushed

Footnotes
THE REVENGER disputed the pace racing along the rail, opened a clear lead turning for home then readily increased his advantage under brisk urging.
MARTINI LANE stalked the duel near the rail, eased out to the three path leaving the turn and gained the place. DISTANT THUNDER disputed the pace
outside the winner and faded in the drive. DESPITE ODDS , unhurried down the backstretch, was six deep leaving the turn and passed tired foes.
CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY was outrun. COME AND GET ME , off the duel, angled five wide entering the stretch and gave way. TYREEK stalked the duel,
was fanned four deep leaving the turn, faltered and was eased.
