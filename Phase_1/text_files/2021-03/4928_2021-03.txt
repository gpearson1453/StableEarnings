SECRET MUSIC ducked out into LIKEUONLYPRETTIER leaving the gate, rallied three wide around the turn then wore down PROPOSITION in deep
stretch. PROPOSITION ducked out into KEW PALACE leaving the gate, showed speed inside, edged clear before a half then gave way late while bearing
out under left hand whip. JESSE THE GREAT went in the air at the break, began a run three wide into the turn, swung wide into the stretch and gained
mildly. KEW PALACE was bumped leaving the gate, was slow early then made a belated run inside. OUR DIXIE BLUE pressed the pace two wide for about
a half then weakened. LIKEUONLYPRETTIER was bumped and forced out leaving the gate, raced wide around the turn and failed to matter.
TOOTSYSROCKNROLLER was outrun.

SALSA'S RETURN settled, rallied three wide around the final turn, drew off into the stretch and was under a hand ride to the end. MAIN COOL CAT lagged
early, swung wide into the stretch and finished with good energy. LE GROS BILL was taken back early, made a four wide run into the stretch but lacked the
needed closing. HIGH FLYING GUY pressed outside the early leader, moved two wide to command before six furlongs then tired. SPIN CYCLE tired
between horses. SCRAP IRON PHIL was caught in tight along the rail around the first turn, came out two wide between horses on the final turn then
stopped in the lane. HURRICANE DANCER made the pace along the rail for about six furlongs then stopped.
