Footnotes
JILL'S A HOT MESS bumped at the start by the breaking in NEBO, chased three wide in aim of the front, advanced to take over command inside the
three-eighths and shook away placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, drew clear under a drive to prevail. BELLA
DOMENICA chased two then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish to preserve
the place honors. KNOW IT ALL RED got bumped solidly askew at the start as BELLA PRINCIPESSA veered in from the outside and then got checked in
behind the rear of MADAME ROSE, conceding five lengths to the front, tipped out to chase four paths off the inside down the backstretch and through the
turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to offer up a mild kick closing belatedly to
secure the show honors after a rough beginning. BELLA PRINCIPESSA veered in at the start bumping KNOW IT ALL RED in the hindquarters and turning
her sideways, then got steadied and pulled off her rival conceding six lengths to the front, chased two then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung three to four wide into upper stretch and made no headway through the final furlong. QUEENTIGUA prompted the pace of MADAME ROSE from the
outside in the two path, got overtaken by the eventual winner at the three-eighths in tandem with the former leader and got placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths in response, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. LITTLE MS SCARLET chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch
before tucking inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. NEBO broke in at
the start bumping JILL'S A HOT MESS, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung
five wide into upper stretch and tired. CALIDAD chased three then two wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, cornered just off the inside for home,
tired. MADAME ROSE broke in at the start filling the space left vacated by the veering in BELLA PRINCIPESSA and was corrected, showed the way in
hand along the inside under pressure from QUEENTIGUA to the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths as the eventual winner ranged up
outside, yielded the front and chased through the latter portion of the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MADERA vied for control from the two path during the initial stages, shook free of the runner up and cut over to the rail nearing the conclusion of the
backstretch, showed the way on a loosely-contested advantage, with the aforementioned rival giving chase towards the two path, got turned loose in the
vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, extended the lead to its largest lead the remainder of the way to the eighth pole, was still comfortably in the clear when
geared down for the last seventy yards. MAGICALLYDELICIOUS disputed the pace to the inside for the top one during the setting of the opening fraction,
saw MADERA assert herself, tipped into path two and went on to stalk that opponent, a bit too far back to apply any serious pressure, got set down for the
drive, proved no match. TRAPPED N MY MIND underwent a three wide pursuit, reached the wire in time to save the show. NICKY SCISSORS hustled from
the gate, yet outsprinted, travelled two wide on the turn, angled into path four in upper stretch, flashed some late energy, missed third.

Footnotes
SICILIA MIKE chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, was in behind the top dueling pair and
tipped out a furlong out leaning on KOSCIUSZKO to gain a clear lane three paths off the rail inside that station, rallied to take command inside the sixteenth
pole and inched away to the finish to prevail. RUNAWAY LUTE hustled from the gate, dueled three then two wide with MANIFEST DESTINY to his inside,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, dug in knocking heads and was collared inside the sixteenth marker, ran on to
secure the place honors. MANIFEST DESTINY broke in at the start carrying in MISSION WRAPITUP, and forcing GIO D'ORO to steady, dueled from the
two path to the inside of the aforementioned foe, tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch,
dug in dueling through to the sixteenth marker when overtaken in tandem by the top one, kept on to preserve the show honors. KOSCIUSZKO four then
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was leaned on near the eighth
pole by SICILIA MIKE looking for a lane, conceded when weakening inside that station and backed away in the late stages. MISSION WRAPITUP got
carried in at the start by MANIFEST DESTINY, who broke inwards and forced GIO D'ORO to steady, chased three to four wide, got set down spinning four
wide into upper stretch and weakened. GIO D'ORO got steadied at the start when MISSION WRAPITUP was carried in by the breaking inwards MANIFEST
DESTINY, conceded three to four lengths to the front, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BIG RED GIRL contended for command from the two path during the initial stages, was allowed to ease back into a stalking role after the first fraction had
been finalized, was patiently ridden keeping watch two wide on the turn, remained on hold caught in some traffic beginning shortly after crossing the midway
point on the turn, stepped into the lane, idled along, keeping pace under a brisk hand ride, inched its way into clearance deep into the furlong grounds,
kicked into its best and clawed up to the one to catch, struck the front with approximately a sixteenth to go and edged away. MARIA'S GIFT cut over to the
inside, got engaged with AURANNIAN after having argued with the top one earlier, got turned loose as did the nemesis in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths
pole, had just vanquished the challenger when a now-freed BIG RED GIRL burst upon the scene in midlane, relinquished for good a sixteenth down the
road, held on for second. TREMAYNE chased the pace three wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path wider, stayed on for the show.
THEATRICAL DANCER took up position in midpack, raced two to three wide on the turn, swung out five for the drive, made no headway in the final furlong.
SOPHIE FATALE rode the rail for nearly three-quarters, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, made no impact. AURANNIAN forwardly placed,
stalked the winner from the two path during the run around the bend, got cued up coming up to the three-sixteenths pole, bid for the next sixteenth, then
weakened steadily after flattening out. EMMY WINNER pocketed, faltered. BELLA BAY lunged in at the start, saved ground for the opening six furlongs,
tipped into the two path at the head of the stretch, was never in it. TONILEE pursued the front runners towards path two for six furlongs, shifted one farther
off the rail at the top of the lane, failed to get involved.

Footnotes
DEMOCRATIC VALUES dueled from the two path with DUST DEVIL to his outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in continuing the duel through the length of the stretch to the wire and gamely fended off his
main rival to prevail at the end. DUST DEVIL dueled three then two wide with the aforementioned foe to his outside, remained patiently handled and swung
three wide for home, got roused straightened away, knocked heads through the length of the stretch trading the front with every bob, fought gamely to the
finish but was ultimately bested by a nostril on the line. PARADE FIELD got bumped at the start by BLOOD MOON and in turn bumped NO LIME shortly
after the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. GRIT AND
GLORY chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish but was
outkicked. BLOOD MOON broke in at the start bumping PARADE FIELD into NO LIME, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung four wide for home and tired. NO LIME got bumped shortly after the start by PARADE FIELD due to pressure from BLOOD MOON, chased along the
inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired.

AIR ATTACK along the inside, contended for the top, shook off the nemesis approaching the five-sixteenths pole, got asked for more a furlong later, gave
the desired response and drew well clear. VILLAINOUS tucked along the inside route, got set down at the five-sixteenths pole, was steered out four wide for
the stretch run, rallied for the place. CONTROL GROUP kept watch on the disputed pace from the two path, was driven into the stretch, got outfinished.
EKHTIBAAR vied for the lead from path two until the five-sixteenths pole, gave way. ATTENTIVE chased the pace from the two path under the end of the
second bend, cut the corner into the lane, lacked a response. KUMAR abandoned the two path for path four after going six furlongs, commenced the stretch
one wider, had no offering. MY AMANJENA strung out three wide on each bend, was under a ride on the second one, folded. DEEP SEA either on the
inside route or in the two path to the quarter pole, went very wide into the lane, got eased under a protected hold and afterwards walked off the track.

IRISH CONSTITUTION bumped at the start by MY ALLURING LADY, who broke inwards, came under hustling and vied inside a pair down the backstretch
and into the turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, shook away and took the inside route into upper stretch, shied out from a near sided stick
nearing the eighth pole before being corrected, edged clear to the finish kept to task. OUT FIRST coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest and along second best.
CHASING CARA hustled from the start, vied outside a pair three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
weakened. MY ALLURING LADY broke in at the start bumping IRISH CONSTITUTION, vied from the two path between foes under coaxing from three
furlongs out, swung three wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
SHE'S AN ALPHA was moved into the three path, crept up to the leader leaving midpoint on the turn, had narrowly taken over when set down spinning into
the lane towards path two by this juncture, inched clear, sensed the runner up closing in a steadfast manner, held sway. EMMA AND I tracked the pace from
the pocket, was asked for run travelling on the turn, angled three wide for the drive, ground up to the winner, fell short. FULL OF FIRE stalked the pace for
nearly three-quarters, commenced the stretch one path wider, staged a mild comeback en route for the show. DELAWARE DESTINY showed the way from
the inside route being coaxed along, was put to the test by SHE'S AN ALPHA as the twosome entering the stretch, yielded, then steadily weakened to finish
out of the money. BELLAMY'SPARTYGIRL saved ground until the end of the bend, got steered three wide into the stretch, made no impact. MIZZYS
IMAGE pursued the pace from path two in midpack, lacked the necessary response. IDAKA sighted pulling on the bit during the early stages, departed the
backstretch from the two path, got sent out five wide from upper to midlane, never made its presence felt. REGAL HONOR saved ground to no avail.
