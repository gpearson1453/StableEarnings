Footnotes
IRISH VALOR was settled last racing to the backstretch, switched outside rivals entering the far turn gathering some momentum, advanced to contention
four wide into upper stretch and produced a sustained response to just edge NICOLE MUNNINGS in time under left handed pressure. The latter was
prompted to a forward placing stalking just outside the pacesetter in the opening half, moved to wrest command from that foe entering the second bend,
shifted out nearing upper stretch, then resisted the winner's bid to the end but came up second best. TAPSOLUTE angled inwards racing to the first turn to
track off the first flight between foes, was prompted to split rivals just off the inside racing into upper stretch gaining striking distance but had no final kick.
TIP SHEET tracked off the first flight outside foes in the opening half, was prompted to gain terms with those three deep lodging a brief bid in that path
entering the far turn but soon emptied out. PAINTER'S PRIDE angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight but dropped out entering
the far turn. BACK PAGE, urged clear along the inside racing to the backstretch, gave way once headed on the far turn.

HONORIFIQUE took up a position tracking off the first flight along the inside, advanced along the rail racing through the far turn to bid inside the pacesetter
in upper stretch, then edged forward of that foe in the closing stages under energetic handling. STRIKING CHROME broke sharply, was urged to the lead
along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace a bit off the rail into the backstretch, dueled for command between foes on the far turn while
repelling a bid from SKY PROPOSAL nearing upper stretch but proved only second best when confronted by the winner. SKY PROPOSAL, a bit reluctant to
load, was urged to terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival in the three path racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue racing into the far turn and
weakened nearing midstretch. HINDSIGHT broke inwards bumping EAST WING, was righted to track off the leaders between foes racing to the
backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into the far turn but faded nearing upper stretch. EAST WING, reluctant to load in the starting gate, was bumped at
the start, settled last to the backstretch, switched out four wide after a half making brief progress but came up empty racing into the far turn.

A FOOLISH FANCY, bumped, then squeezed back at the start, settled last racing through the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the leaders racing
five wide entering the turn, shifted inwards moving to terms with the leaders nearing upper stretch, shifted in appearing to make light contact with RACHEL'S
WISH but took over from that foe and kicked clear under right handed pressure. RACHEL'S WISH broke outwards making contact with the eventual winner
at the start, was collected to track off the second flight outside rivals in the opening stages, steadily gained contention racing four wide into the turn, shifted
inwards nearing the lane to wrest the advantage between calls in upper stretch, appeared to be bumped while being roused to resist the winner's bid but
proved only second best. CHILLIN LADY was rated three wide between foes in second flight in early stages, was held up in close quarters racing past the
three furlong marker, shifted out nearing upper stretch to advance four wide in the stretch and continued willingly to close the gap. CHATTIN WITH JENNY
tracked off the first flight between racing through the backstretch, briefly awaited an opening entering the turn, swung wide nearing upper stretch but had no
closing response. DEEPLY ANALYTICAL broke readily, disputed the pace outside a rival through the backstretch, dueled between foes through the bend
and came up empty in upper stretch. V K PRINCESS ducked inwards at the start, was collected to race along the rail through the backstretch, was held up
entering the turn awaiting an opening, came through inside foes racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. BUSINESSINDUBAI, forwardly placed
three wide tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn, gave way nearing the lane. MARIA'S MIRAGE, urged along the inside disputing the pace through
the backstretch, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
VALLEY WILDCAT ducked out at the start while being bumped, then dropping out last just after the break, was prompted to regain position splitting foes
racing into the turn, angled inside on the bend gaining momentum, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest the
advantage in time under firm right handed pressure. FREE FLAYME angled inwards to track just outside the pacesetter racing into the turn, steadily moved
to close the gap racing through the stretch but was outkicked by the winner while edging a rival for the place honors. PRETTY CHITU broke sharply, angled
to the inside dictating the pace a bit off the rail racing into the turn, maintained the advantage past midstretch but was collared late.
DISTURBINGTHEPEACE split foes in the opening stages, then angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the turn, was prompted to
advance along the rail racing into upper stretch but had no final kick. IMPERIAL IVOR settled last along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out gaining
position between foes nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. LOGSDON angled to the inside early dropping off the second flight and failed to
menace thereafter. SPINNING JOEY, urged to a forward placing three deep in the opening stages, continued in pursuit of the leaders four wide through the
turn and steadily faded nearing upper stretch. SIR HIGGINS, off slowly, switched outside rivals early while being prompted to a contending position, was
caught five wide racing into the turn and soon emptied out.

Footnotes
COURAGEOUS CRAFT broke outwards making light contact with WORDMAN, was quickly righted, then urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the
backstretch into the turn, continued in a grudging effort past midstretch and edged away in the closing stages under firm left handed encouragement. PACHI
was urged forcing the pace just outside the eventual winner racing through the backstretch to the turn, pressed the issue to midstretch but came up second
best. EAGLE KEEPER tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, angled to the inside on the bend, then shifted three wide in the closing
stages while continuing in pursuit of the top pair. TARQUIN tracked off the first flight inside foes in the opening stages, shifted out four wide nearing upper
stretch but finished evenly late. VET'S GIFT joined the pace three wide racing through the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the leaders into the turn and
gave way racing through upper stretch. JUST LIKE DUNCAN tracked off the first flight three wide in the opening stages but couldn't produce a closing
response. LUCA DREW THE ACE broke sharply, was caught five wide on the backstretch tracking off the first flight and faded nearing upper stretch. SOLE
SEEKER dropped out early. MARK ME dislodged his rider to momentarily run loose in the chute before the start and retreated from contention early.
WORDMAN, bumped at the start, was devoid of pace despite being roused briskly by his rider, trailed the field throughout but displayed some late interest in
the last furlong.

Footnotes
MYSTIC LINK angled inwards tracking the first flight from just out of striking distance a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily gained between
rivals racing into the far turn, shifted out three wide entering upper stretch and produced a sustained response to just edge EXCHEQUER in time under right
handed pressure. The latter joined the pace three wide racing into the first turn, pressed the issue outside a rival to gain the advantage after a half, held
sway on a clear margin through the far turn past midstretch, resisted the winner's challenge but just failed to contain that foe. LITTLE MAZZY, off last, was
settled well off the leaders to the backstretch, was prompted to split foes just off the inside nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position
along the inside while prevailing for a share. DISCREET HEAT, urged between foes prompting the pace racing into the first turn, dropped back from that
position entering the backstretch to race last into the far turn, but continued three deep between foes into the stretch to regain position with a second effort
in the closing stages. PLATO exchanged light contact with BACANO at the start, was urged to gain a position in the second flight racing three wide between
foes to the backstretch, continued in that path to make brief pursuit of the pacesetter racing into the far turn but emptied out into upper stretch. LITIGANT
was urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset to the backstretch but gave way after a half. BACANO exchanged light contact with PLATO at the
start, switched out four wide gaining terms with the second flight racing to the backstretch, but retreated early.

Footnotes
INITFORTHELOVE broke readily to gain a forward placing stalking the pacesetter, continued with a steady bid to gain terms with that foe racing into the far
turn, went clear racing into the stretch and extended the advantage under firm handling. KING ANDRES was rated between foes while angling nearer to the
inside racing to the backstretch, shifted to the rail on the far turn steadily advancing to contention, tipped out racing into upper stretch but proved only
second best in the drive. ESTILO PELIGROSO was settled last racing to the backstretch, advanced three deep racing into the far turn, split rivals in that
path entering upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share. RED HOOD, urged to the lead along the inside, set the pace to the far turn,
dueled inside the eventual winner nearing the lane and gave way midstretch. NO TIME TO YAWN, a bit erratic racing into the backstretch, tracked the
leaders along the inside and saved ground to the lane in an even effort. MR. SARCASTIC, caught five wide racing into the first turn, was prompted to make
brief progress four wide racing to the far turn but came up empty in the drive. INSIDER TRADING angled to the inside while racing in the last flight entering
the first turn, steadied out of close quarters between foes entering the far turn and had no further response. VIOLATOR, caught four wide between racing
into the first turn, made brief progress three deep between foes racing to the far turn and gave way into the lane. GOT FASHION, pulling against restraint
while a bit rank racing through the chute, gained a forward placing racing three deep to the backstretch but was through after a half. MOUNTAIN HOLIDAY
WAS CAST IN THE GATE, NECESSITATING HIS LATE SCRATCH.

Footnotes
BROADWAY PETE, forwardly placed three wide prompting the pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue racing into the far turn to gain the
advantage, then forged clear while angling to the inside in upper stretch, holding sway to the end under firm left handed encouragement. IT'S
MANDATORY, caught four wide racing into the first turn tracking just off the first flight, was prompted to advance in that path racing into the far turn but
couldn't gain even terms with the winner. YEUDIEL, reserved between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to split foes while shifting out three
wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to gain a share. PRIVATE ASTRAY settled three deep between foes in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, split foes in that path on the far turn, was fanned four wide racing into upper stretch and had no late kick. STOPIT, urged inside foes disputing
the pace a bit off the rail from the outset to the far turn, gave way into the lane. IMPERIAL GUARD, urged between foes disputing the pace from the break to
the far turn, faded nearing upper stretch. BIJEMINI SLEW was rated off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch but gave way after a half. YADI, off
a step slowly, was prompted to regain contention racing five wide to the backstretch but dropped out early.

Footnotes
ANTALYA was settled between rivals in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail after a half, gradually gained position saving ground on the
far turn, advanced inside foes in upper stretch, tipped out three deep to split foes midstretch and wrested a clear advantage in time under firm handling.
MORGAN'S Z VA, forwardly placed along the rail tracking just off the pacesetter, switched outside that foe racing into the far turn to press the issue to upper
stretch, dueled for command between foes to late stages and prevailed for second. CLASSICAL MAGIC was urged clear racing through the chute while
angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, dueled for command inside foes past midstretch and yielded to the top pair
late. SHES DYNOMITE, forwardly placed outside the pacesetter as part of the second flight, was prompted to challenge three deep between foes nearing
upper stretch, lost some ground to the leaders entering the lane, then angled inwards in the closing stages and continued with interest to improve her
placing late. OVER TO YOU was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum while shifting out four wide in
upper stretch bumping ELUSIVE RYDER, bid between foes in that path but lacked the needed final kick. ELUSIVE RYDER settled outside foes in the last
flight racing to the backstretch, was caught five wide while gaining position after a half, advanced four wide through the far turn, was fanned five wide
entering the lane, was bumped in upper stretch and continued evenly late. MARMALADE was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the
backstretch and steadily faded into the stretch. SWEET STORY settled along the inside as part of the last flight and failed to menace. MAD GRACE, caught
four wide just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to gain some position in the second quarter but gave way after a half. TANAGER
tracked off the second flight three wide between foes racing to the backstretch and was through after half.
