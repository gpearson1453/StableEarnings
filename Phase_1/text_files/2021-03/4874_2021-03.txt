Footnotes
FIRST CONTACT showed good speed and set the pace, vied inside on the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, accelerated clear when
put to a right-handed crop approaching the furlong marker and drew off under steady urging. CONATIVE broke a bit slow, dropped well behind under urging,
went two to three wide on the turn, gained along the rail under a right-handed crop in the stretch and finished with late energy to get the place.
PASSAGEWAY tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two path on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, lost touch with the winner into
the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. JACKFRUIT was urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, swung six wide while
gaining into upper stretch but flattened out.. LYNCHBURG was hustled from the start, brushed with a foe early, was urged along off the pace, went around
the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. JAZZ IT UP bobbled at the start then was hustled before being taken in hand behind horses at the
five-eighths, moved out behind those foes shortly thereafter then settled on the outside, went three wide while asked on the turn, spun four wide into the
stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
JACI'S ROYALTY was hustled from the start then became keen when taken in hand early, lugged out some into the first turn then dropped towards the
inside, remained keen while tugging hard at the bit under vigorous restraint on the backstretch, saved ground while still in reserve on the far turn, finally
leveled out inside the five-sixteenths then was roused at the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed
strongly to get up late. IZZY'S BABY BOY went three then two wide on the first turn, dropped back while settling off the pace on the backstretch, saved
ground on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, rallied along the rail in the stretch, closed strongly to make a bid late but missed while narrowly able to
get the place. RELUCTANT WARRIOR went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the front on the outside, was asked three wide on the far turn, rallied
four wide into the stretch, took the lead passing the three-sixteenths, edged clear into the final furlong, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while able
to hold the show. INCA WARRIOR was reserved near the back while two to three wide, came under urging approaching the quarter-pole, moved out under
a drive in upper stretch and finished with good energy for the last spot in the superfecta. LUCKENBACHER saved ground on the first turn, settled off the
pace, was hard ridden while three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the superfecta. STANDING MAN
saved ground at the rear of the field, was put to a drive in upper stretch, moved out near the furlong marker and gained but missed the minor awards.
RIPITTOTHERIGHT contested the pace on the inside, moved clear briefly while asked at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage at the three-sixteenths pole
and gave way. LES PAUL came out into the first turn, went four wide on that bend, settled towards the rear, went four wide on the far turn, came six wide
into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ARCTIC ROSE was taken in hand early, went five wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside,
came under urging while four wide on the far turn and faltered. HOT APRIORITY rounded the first turn in the four path, contested the pace on the outside,
was asked in the two path on the far turn and stopped. (Rail at 16 Feet)

Footnotes
MR. UNIVERSE saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, moved closer while three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied
outside to make a bid outside the furlong marker, dueled with the runner-up to the wire and gamely prevailed under strong urging. BALLINONABUDJET
went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, moved closer while four wide on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, took the
lead at the three-sixteenths, dueled gamely inside of the winner in the final furlong and was denied while able to get the place. SMARTY ALEX settled on
the inside, moved closer on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, altered out behind foes near the furlong marker, altered out again just inside the
furlong marker and finished with good courage while well clear for the show. TOTALLY ADDICTED bumped with a rival at the start, went six wide early on
the first turn then dropped to the four path, settled off the pace, ranged up two then three wide on the far turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole then brushed
with a foe after straightening for the drive, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. MOMENT OF STARDOM lugged out into the first turn, went
three wide on that bend, settled towards the back, saved ground on the far turn, came off the rail into the stretch then moved further out under a drive and
lacked the needed response. MUSTA GOT LOST raced in the three path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far
turn, took a brief lead at the quarter-pole, brushed with a foe after turning into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. BITSY'S OTHER
HALF was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the inside, was asked on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and gave way. CHARLIE G
bumped with a rival at the start, went four to five wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked four wide on the far turn, dropped back
five wide into the stretch and capitulated. IRISH BAYOU was carried out into the first turn, went four wide on that bend, settled on the outside, raced three
wide while unasked on the far turn, dropped back four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. (Rail at 16 Feet)

the outside, moved in with a half-mile to run, came between horses under tight restraint at the seven-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn, was asked four
wide into the stretch, moved out around the three-sixteenths then made a bid, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to
get the place. ADINA was hustled from the start, showed good speed then pressed the pace on the outside, took a short lead in the two path inside the

sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked while just able to get the show. NINE LINE BIND came outward at the start, settled off the pace, was urged along in the
two path on the turn, came under the crop in upper stretch and finished willingly to just miss the show. BLUE RIDGE HEAT moved up between horses to get
the lead, set the pace under pressure, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead under urging just inside the three-eighths, dropped back into upper
stretch, paused when the winner came in at the furlong marker, drifted out around the sixteenth-pole and tired. HONDURAS GIRL was off slow and spotted
the front several lengths, went four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CANDY CANDY CANDY had a shoe repaired
in the paddock, settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, dropped in late and was no factor. LIL
PEASTOCH settled off the pace, was urged four wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. EMERY'S DREAM settled on
the outside, was urged five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and never reached contention. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK was slow into stride,

Footnotes
YOU'RE DOING FINE was hustled from the start, raced just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out into upper stretch, dropped in behind the
leaders at the furlong marker, rallied to make a rail bid into the final sixteenth and got up under strong handling. RUMPUS chased the pace, was carried out
into the turn, made a bid between horses while brushing with a foe in the four path at the five-sixteenths, fought on even terms for the lead into the final
furlong, drifted in under threat to her inside outside the sixteenth-pole, led into the final sixteenth and was caught but clear for the place. MY TOMMY LEE
settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out under a drive and finished willingly to just get
the show. PINK POSSE broke out and bumped hard with a rival, settled on the outside, was carried out leaving the backstretch, advanced to make a bid in
the five path on the turn, brushed with a foe at the five-sixteenths, battled on even terms for the lead under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back into
the final sixteenth and weakened. GLITTERARY settled towards the rear, went two to three wide on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and
improved position without threatening. CHAMBERS CREEK set the clear pace, lugged out into the turn, vied in the three path on that bend, was headed just
inside the five-sixteenths, dropped to the two path into the stretch, chased into the final furlong and tired. DEVIL WITH A DASH broke a step slow, settled
towards the rear on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. MISS DOGWOOD bumped hard
with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. IT'S MY TUNE was well placed
just off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. DOLLY EMMONS broke a few lengths slow, was
reserved at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, took an awkward stride against the rail while inside of a foe at the five-sixteenths and failed to
threaten. (Rail at 16 Feet)

Footnotes
G'S SQUEEZE brushed with a rival at the start while hustled, contested the pace on the inside of two foes, vied along the rail while still inside those rivals on
the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, battled with the runner-up into the final furlong, disposed of that foe outside the sixteenth-pole then drew clear
under strong urging. OURS FOREVER bumped with a rival at the start, disputed the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the three path on the turn, was
asked for her best in upper stretch, battled with the winner until outside the sixteenth-pole then proved no match while clear for the place. MY REBEL GIRL
was a bit reluctant to load, broke very slow and spotted the front several lengths, went three wide on the turn and finished with good energy to garner the
show. IBEGTODIFFER was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed response. OPPS MY
BAD was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved out near the half-mile pole, went five wide on the turn, floated nine wide into upper stretch and
improved position. HONG KONG STRONG was bumped at the start then forced into another rival, moved in while off the pace around the half-mile pole,
raced in the two early on the turn then dropped to the inside, was driven three wide while gaining into the stretch then moved out around the
three-sixteenths and flattened out. CUSTOM FOR ALY broke in and bumped with a rival, was urged along on the outside, went two to three wide on the
turn, came four wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed response. WHO DAT GREY broke out at the start, raced near the middle of the field, went
three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to rally. PUZZLING PRIORITY disputed the pace tightly
between horses, vied in the two path while still between horses on the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and tired. MA CHER AMIO was urged
along off the pace, went four to five wide on the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. PUMP IT brushed with a foe at the start, saved
ground towards the rear and faltered then was pulled up in upper stretch but walked off.
