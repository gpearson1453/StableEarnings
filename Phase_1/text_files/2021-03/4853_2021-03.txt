SHORT OF EZ was unhurried early, advanced six wide through the turn, was closing through the stretch, drifted in, took control late and edged clear.
MAJOR MUNNINGS set a pressured early pace, raced three wide into the turn, opened up in early stretch, couldn't hold off the winner and was clearly
second best. UNCLE GOYLE was up close early, went five wide into the turn, angled out late and weakened. BURN ME TWICE raced in mid pack early,
angled out eight wide out of the turn and finished belatedly. E J'S GOLD was void of any early speed, raced along the inside and never fired. SOMBRA
NEGRA was allowed to settle early, raced four wide and was empty. ONTHEWINGSOFADREAM pressed the early pace from between rivals and faded.
