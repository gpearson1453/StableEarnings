Footnotes
SOCIAL CHIC sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. LIKE SEGAL was off a step
slow, settled just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, could not gain on the winner but was clearly second best. SAINT VRAIN
chased the winner while racing four-wide throughout and gave way in the drive. RRACE DAY WARRIOR lagged early, saved ground through the 2nd turn
and was not a factor. DYNAMIC DAY pressed the pace of the winner for a half and weakened.

Footnotes
RYE HUMOR was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the
closing yards. AMERICAN PIPER sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, was in control through mid-stretch but could not
resist the winner from over the top. GOLD CZAR hopped at the start, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished
with a steady bid. NATIVE COURAGE broke sharply to track GOLD CZAR from the inside and gave way after going five furlongs. HAPPY BEE raced
five-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. PRINCE AMADEUS raced four-wide
through the first turn, settled off the leaders throughout and failed to rally. O DRISCOLL lagged throughout.

CAPE LOOKOUT was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear lead with a furlong to run and held sway to the wire.
UNEQUIVOCAL was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good late energy. SOUND OFF
was never far back, raced three-wide through the second turn, gained a striking position into the lane but failed to sustain his rally in the drive. HOBE
SOUND raced four-wide through the first turn then was forwardly placed, moved three-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed late response.
ITGOT GRANDMA was bumped at the break, showed brief speed and weakened. CHARITABLE SPENNY was off a step slow and bumped then hustled
along to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after going five furlongs.

TAKE ME HOME was away in good order to stalk the dueling leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole
and drew off with complete authority. KINGSTON TIME broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside, responded when challenged by the winner nearing
the three-sixteenths pole and yielded to that rival in the drive. LADY MACHO was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the
second turn and finished with a steady bid. BIRD TRAFFIC showed no early speed, saved ground throughout and did not reach contention. SOLID AS A
ROCK disputed the pace while racing three-wide for a half and weakened.

Footnotes
DAN THE MAN CAN dueled for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and drew off through the lane. MELTECH stalked the
leaders while racing four-wide throughout, reached a striking position into the stretch but failed to gain on the winner late. EASTBOUND N DOWN broke
sharply to dispute the early fractions with the winner while racing three-wide, gave way after going three furlongs, fell after the wire and was walked off.
REATA'S CASTLE settled off the leaders throughout and finished evenly in the drive. NAZCA MYSTERY was checked soon after the start, showed no early
speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. STERLING CAESAR lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not menace.

SUPER GARNER sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, increased his margin into the second turn, was ridden out while much the
best. SCOTTISH MAN was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy. POTENTIAL
GRIZZLY raced four-wide through the first turn, chased the leaders while racing three-wide, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths, was no match for the
winner and gave way for the place. ELLIE'S LIL MAN lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. CATCH MY
CABOOSE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed closing response. JEFFERY SCOTT hopped at
the start, lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. GRUMPELSTILTSKIN was fractious at the gate, chased the
winner while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. SILVER TAURUS settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn
and weakened.
