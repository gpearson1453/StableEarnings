Footnotes
SISTER IS DEVIL prompted the pace two wide, seized command near the three-eighths pole, drew clear around the turn, widened in upper stretch and
lasted under a steady drive. NOT TONIGHT BOBBY saved ground in range around the first turn, went two wide between foe around the far turn, angled out
in upper stretch, rallied while drifting out under left-handed urging and was gaining fast late. OUR TEN ANGELS tracked the pace three wide, bid nearing
the lane and was one-paced in the stretch. B C BELLE raced off the pace two wide, moved up a bit three wide around the far turn and lacked the needed
rally. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY failed to menace while racing three wide. ISLA BONITA chased the pace four wide around both turns and weakened in the
lane. DONTMESSWITHTESS saved ground to no avail. PRIZE PORTRAIT played no factor while racing three and four wide. WRONGFULLY ACCUSED
was forced out and checked entering the first turn, raced mostly four wide around that bend, saved ground around the far turn and never threatened.
WATERMELON SUGAR was bumped at the start, checked repeatedly through the opening quarter, saved ground, made some progress around the far
turn, checked off heels near the quarter pole, angled out and was not persevered with in the lane. MISS CONSTITUTION set the pace along the rail and
retreated from the three-eighths marker. THE JOKES ON ME got out entering the first turn and made little impact while racing three to four wide.

Footnotes
HIGH HEATER tracked the leaders three wide, took over from outside approaching the quarter-pole, drew clear under a drive through upper stretch and
was kept busy to the finish. ZIPPY spotted the field a couple lengths at the start, swung four wide leaving the turn, and finished well on the far outside to be
clearly second best. WHYRUAWESOME moved off the inside to the three-path on the turn, and tired through the last eighth of a mile. ROYAL SQUEEZE
pressed CHILL HAZE from outside for a half-mile, and faded. CHILL HAZE set a pressured pace inside, and was through soon after going a half. THE
MIGHTY JUDGE broke two lengths slow, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GHOSTLY BEAUTY was unhurried to the far turn, swung four wide rallying into the stretch, and finished determinedly outside SKYE SNOW to get up in
time. SKYE SNOW moved four wide to join the leaders approaching the stretch, reached the front through the furlong grounds while staying on her left lead,
and could not withstand the top one late. ANTIGONE stayed in range early, was strung out five wide just outside GHOSTLY BEAUTY past the quarter-pole,
could not kick on with the latter but finished willingly to go clear for the show. EMOLGA saved ground on the turns, entered the lane behind the first flight
and was outfinished. ALL ABOUT KATHERN raced three wide, lodged a bid turning for home, but weakened past the eighth-pole. MRS. MAISEL pressed
the pace outside KAYSERI, gained a brief lead between horses leaving the far turn, but gave way through the drive. KAYSERI tugged along showing the
way inside to the far turn, then succumbed to challengers at the top of the stretch. RUN BLONDIE RUN failed to factor inside.

TRAPPEZOID tracked the pace three wide, took over nearing the quarter pole, angled in in upper stretch and widened under left-handed urging. MEADE
settled off the pace outside, raced four wide around the turn, never threatened the winner but was along late for the place. BRASSTOWN set the pace along
the rail, was collared near the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch and lost second late. PLEASE SIT DOWN saved ground off the pace, swung out in
upper stretch and went evenly. HERO TIGER stalked the pace two wide and faded in the lane. LONG GRAY LINE failed to menace while racing two wide
around the turn and swinging six wide in upper stretch. JANUARY WON steadied early and trailed throughout. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
UNCAPTURED SOLDIER grabbed the lead with an alert break, vied inside AMERICAN MATTERS around the turn, and edged away past the eighth-pole
under a steady drive. THE ICE BEAST bumped with TOP BOSS up the backstretch, raced near the inside around the turn, and finished well to go clear for
the place. ESPIA broke slowly, raced three wide, and lacked a solid closing bid. AMERICAN MATTERS pressed UNCAPTURED SOLDIER from outside,
went head and head through the turn, then weakened in deep stretch yielding larger shares. TOP BOSS got bumped around between THE ICE BEAST and
TIMEWON'TLETMEGO up the backstretch, dropped back entering the turn and offered nothing more on the far outside late. TIMEWON'TLETMEGO
bumped with TOP BOSS early, raced two to three wide on the turn, and had nothing left in the stretch.

Footnotes
STAR WEAVER was bumped after the start, raced in range three wide between foes, shifted widest in upper stretch, closed outside and was up in the final
strides. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR pressed the pace in the three path, was floated out turning for home, dueled outside of ZORB through the lane, edged
ahead of that foe but could not quite hold off the winner. ZORB set the pace in the two path, drifted out turning for home, fought on between foes in the lane
and yielded late. COOL HAND COOP was in range inside, came through a wide open rail to bid nearing the eighth pole but flattened out in the final furlong.
KING OF ROCK was bumped between foes early, raced four wide and never threatened. SEA TRIDENT went evenly inside. ROCKET BLAST was bumped
soon after the start, raced three wide and played no further factor. FRANCO'S TEAM advanced four wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the
lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
TWIRLING FAITH saved ground behind the leaders on the turn, switched out for clearance at the top of the stretch, stayed on her left lead battling outside
rivals through a long drive and finished on even terms for the win. MS MESHAK set a pressured pace in the two-path, dug in when challenged by SHES ALL
WOMAN and TWIRLING FAITH through the lane, drifted out and held for a share of the top spot. SHES ALL WOMAN moved out three to four wide
approaching the stretch, bid between MS MESHAK and TWIRLING FAITH while in close quarters, and was edged out late. BARGAINAIRE raced in striking
range three to four wide early, and faded through the lane. REAGAN'S ROSE was no factor three then two wide. NANTUCKET RED broke slowly and was
never in the hunt. JESSICA was finished after a half-mile near the inside.

Footnotes
BEAUTY BOSS sprinted to the front after a quick getaway, shook off PINK SHOELACES approaching the stretch, and held firm for the decision. JULIE
BIRD (IRE) bumped with T. WALTZ at the start, saved ground in easy striking range for three furlongs, shifted to the two-path with aim outside the winner at
the top of the stretch, and finished willingly to be a clear runner-up. ALEXANDRA AM I bumped with BLUE SPARKLE at the start, raced three then four wide
around the turn, and finished evenly between horses to get the show. T. WALTZ bumped with JULIE BIRD at the start, settled in the two-path to the stretch,
and lacked the needed closing bid inside rivals. EXAGGERATED MOMENT raced four then five wide approaching the stretch, and finished evenly outside.
IMPRESSIVE ONE bumped with BLUE SPARKLE after the start, and raced far back toward the inside. PINK SHOELACES pursued BEAUTY BOSS from
outside into the turn, drifted out a path or two at the top of the stretch, and tired. BLUE SPARKLE bumped with IMPRESSIVE ONE at the break, then with
ALEXANDRA AM I right after that, and was far back throughout. MIAMI GOLD raced three wide and was never close.
