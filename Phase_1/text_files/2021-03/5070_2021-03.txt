ANOTATION had a tardy start, rushed three wide into the turn, stayed on with a game effort to wire. HOT HEELS inside run to quarter pole, stayed game to
wire but outfinished late. WATERMARK off slow with no speed to the turn, angled out with a late run in the drive for show. MINER'S GEM sparred with
leader to deep stretch but faltered in the late going. TRICK HAT never a real factor. ISABIS chased to the turn with nothing left and dropped back. ORIENT
NIGHT rushed between horses to lead but gave way readily into the stretch. AMBER WAVES always outrun.

the quarter pole while no match late. OSAGE MOON rushed to the front, pressured to far turn and weakened in the stretch to settle for the show spot. LORD
GUINNESS pulling along while in tight first turn, raced evenly throughout with no late kick in the stretch run. GLENNWOOD chased leader to far turn,
weakened from quarter pole readily. TEZ never a factor. ESKENFORIT raced evenly from inside to far turn, gave suddenly thereafter.
