Footnotes
DOM STRAIT was reserved early, circled seven wide through the second turn, was gaining late and was up in time for the win. SUPER ACCORD chased
the early pace, went four wide into the turn, took a brief lead in late stretch and was tagged in the final strides. TOWARDS THE LIGHT set a clear pace,
raced three wide into the second turn, met the bid of SUPER ACCORD, dueled to late stretch and finished a game third. VICTORY LANE was unhurried
early, circled eight wide through the second turn and offered a mild late rally. COLLINS AVE was outrun early, raced five wide into the second turn and
finished evenly late. MCTHANKS was outrun early, raced between rivals into the home turn and finished belatedly. IRON ALEX was taken back early, went
four wide into the second turn and never fired. RONTON was void of any early, saved ground and offered no late rally. FOREVER THE CHIEF was allowed
to settle early and was no threat. MUHNEY LINE raced in mid pack early, went six wide into the second turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
N. K. ROCKET MAN set a clear early pace, raced off the rail through both turns, opened up and edged clear for the win. MY GOLDEN BOY stalked the
early pace, raced along the inside into the home turn, angled out in mid stretch, was no match late and finished second best. HOLY CROSS was allowed to
settle early, saved ground into the home turn, angled out through the stretch and was along for third. JUROR was taken back early, raced off the rail into the
home turn, angled out far wide and finished belatedly. LUCKENBACH chased the early pace, went three wide into the second turn, drifted out and
weakened. FAST GALLITO raced in mid pack early, went six wide into the second turn, drifted out late and faded. SPINNING BLACK was outrun early,
raced five wide through the second turn and never fired. BARELYSTILLCOUNTS was unhurried and was no threat. THE THIRD RING broke in at the start,
raced in mid pack early, raced along the rail into the home turn and was empty late. GREY POINT was allowed to settled from between rivals and tired. MT.
TAYLOR was fractious in the gate, was void of speed and retreated.
