DYNAMIC DAY was squeezed leaving the gate then picked up the chase down the backstretch, came through the turn about the five path and dug in from
the top of the stretch to get up at the wire. BI BI CARPE became edgy in the gate then broke inward, angled to the inside and set a pressured pace,
rounded the turn at the rail, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was nipped under the wire. TANELEER chased off the rail, rounded the turn
about the three path, dug in through the lane and just lasted in third. CROWN AND COKE chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail, dug in from the head
of the lane and just missed third. LUNAR IMAGE came out to make contact with Grandpa Munster leaving the gate then picked up the chase, raced in the
four and five paths of the turn and passed rivals down the lane. MUSTA NEVER MET U was forced inward at the break, gave chase through the
backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path then weakened. GRANDPA MUNSTER became edgy in the gate then crowded and pinched back on the
chute, angled to the outside to give chase and raced in the six path of the turn. VINNYVINVINCENT was not a factor.

BOUNDTOBEOK stalked off the rail then challenged nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead approaching the quarter, raced clear on the far turn and
dug in under steady encouragement through the lane. JAMESTOWN ROAD settled off the pace toward the inside, steadied at the heels of Tiz Evan's
Honey past the three eighths pole, bid off the rail into the far turn and challenged past the eighth pole, but couldn't improve. MY EMMALLY raced in the four
path the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn three wide and showed little further. KATALIMA
came through the opening turn in the three path then stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase past the three eighths pole then weakened off the rail
on the far turn. TIZ EVAN'S HONEY rated the pace inside then came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught toward the quarter pole
and faded at the rail on the far turn. STERLINGS MORENA loped along early and was well back.
