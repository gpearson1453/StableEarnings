Footnotes
MAKER OF AN EMPIRE settled off the early pace two wide, advanced inside down the backstretch, stalked from the rail around the far turn, made little
progress while urged along near the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch, belatedly switched leads nearing the eighth pole, rallied outside of the
pacesetter, was up near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. COUNT DOWN set the pace in the two path, angled in nearing the far turn, led
to the sixteenth pole but could not hold off the winner. GUNMAN prompted the pace from the three path around the first turn, two wide around the far turn
and weakened in the lane. MUTAKAAMIL was no threat while racing three wide. COMMISSIONER G chased the pace four wide around the first turn and
faded three wide around the far turn. HALO'S DANCE had brief speed inside. MACADE was reluctant to load and trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
C'MON KAREN was outrun early, came five wide rallying off the turn, finished determinedly and edged SKYFLY after a long drive. SKYFLY pursued R
LOVE ON THE RUN from outside, bid between horses into the stretch, and could not match strides with the winner late while clearly second best. R LOVE
ON THE RUN set the pace a bit off the rail, got collared past the furlong marker and gave way inside the top two. CAJUN LADY broke slowly, raced four
wide advancing mildly after three-eighths of a mile, but flattened out in the lane. PIPER stayed in range three wide early, then faded. CHISPITA was outrun
three to four wide. PLAYERA tired inside through the stretch. DOES SHE KNOW broke slowly and showed little at the back.

Footnotes
LOVELORN LADY went head and head with HONORABLY from the start, put that one away in upper stretch and was kept to pressure to stay clear.
CALLEN'S CHARISMA received a bump from MOMENTITA at the start, pursued the battling leaders from the two-path to the stretch, finished willingly and
was clearly second best. SECRETS TOLD bumped with SUMMER BEAUTY at the start, chased three wide just outside CALLEN'S CHARISMA around the
turn, and lacked a closing response. HONORABLY dueled outside LOVELORN LADY to the top of the stretch, and gave way. SUMMER BEAUTY bumped
with SECRETS TOLD at the start, raced three to four wide, and dropped far back through the stretch. MOMENTITA broke out bumping CALLEN'S
CHARISMA, and was through early inside.

Footnotes
UNCLE FUN got bumped between DEWY'S HIT and MISTER LEONARDO and steadied first time under the wire, raced near the back early, rallied four
wide coming off the far turn, and finished with a flourish to win going away. CHAO split horses advancing early on the far turn, was in the midst of putting in
a run when forced to stall in traffic a quarter-mile out, regrouped into the stretch and finished well while swapping back to his left lead. MISTER LEONARDO
broke outward, was corrected and came in bumping with UNCLE FUN, moved strongly three then four wide around the far turn, took over in upper stretch,
then was overhauled through the last sixteenth of a mile. JEHA was slow into stride, trailed inside for six furlongs, swung four wide into the stretch and
rallied mildly. DEWY'S HIT bumped with UNCLE FUN shortly after the start, stalked the leaders in the clear leaving the backstretch, stayed in contention
three wide to upper stretch, but faded late. TAMANRASSETT bumped with OUR STUIE at the start, hugged the rail for six furlongs, lacked room and had to
check behind CHAO approaching the stretch, and could not recover. GO MIKE pressed OUR STUIE from outside for six furlongs, and had nothing left in the
stretch. OUR STUIE lunged out of the gate and bumped with TAMANRASSETT, went up to set the pace inside, and faltered into the stretch.

RASPBERRY BALLET was bumped at the start, raced well back two wide, swung five wide near the five-sixteenths pole, closed outside, seized command
leaving the eighth pole and powered clear while lugging in. RECIPROCAL tracked the early pace three wide, bid between rivals midway around the turn,
took the lead in upper stretch, led past the eighth pole but was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth. MY HAPPY GIRL broke in and bumped the
winner at the start, raced off the pace three wide, made some progress nearing the lane, angled four wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally. EMMA
ROSE dueled along the rail to midstretch and weakened. MO CLARE'S dueled two wide for five furlongs and faded in the lane. STARSHIP NUGGET
tracked the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. ROCKIN WITH LUCKY saved ground in range but was through after a half.

Footnotes
ACCESSIBLE was slow from the gate and unhurried early, circled five wide rallying past the quarter-pole, rallied steadily and was up outside POPPY'S
BOYS while brushed late by that rival. POPPY'S BOYS raced four wide most of the way, advanced after six furlongs, bid through mid stretch, drifted out
under heavy left-hand pressure brushing with ACCESSIBLE late, and was edged to the wire. AUBURN HILLS bumped with DILIGENT at the start, lagged
well back to the far turn, angled widest into the lane and finished gamely. EXPRESS PHAROAH raced in closest attendance to TREASURE RUN early,
wrested command from outside approaching the quarter-pole, moved inside for the drive and was outfinished. ZIPALONG saved ground on the turns, and
did not seriously threaten with an even finish. SOUPER ENERGIZER steadied slightly behind and between horses on the first turn, remained wedged
between foes in traffic on the far turn, put in a mild bid on the rail through mid stretch but did not have enough. STRIKE THE TOP raced two to three wide
throughout, and lacked a solid closing response. AFICIONADO stayed in range three wide to the stretch, and tired late. DILIGENT bumped with AUBURN
HILLS at the start, saved ground until shifting to the two-path at the top of the stretch, and made no headway. TREASURE RUN sped off early, got collared
approaching the quarter-pole, and gave way. ROAD TO PEACE lost contact with the field early, eventually crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
PURECRAZIDUDE tracked the pace three wide, seized command near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, drifted out under right-handed urging
through the stretch and widened. MEMORABLE settled off the pace outside, gained four wide around the turn, was no threat to the winner but stayed on to
gain the place. TONS OF GOLD saved ground in midpack, angled out near the eighth pole and finished evenly. SAINT LARNED was bumped at the start,
moved up inside to take the lead midway down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail around the far turn, led to the quarter pole, continued on the left
lead in the lane and tired. WICKED TEMPTATIONS had early speed outside, chased two wide and around the turn and faded nearing the lane. FLAMING
HOT had early speed, stopped and was eased. MASON'S SONG bumped with SAINT LARNED at the start, trailed outside and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BERNIE'S MISTRESS pressed CAPTAIN SAM from outside, wrested command leaving the eighth-pole and drew clear under a drive. UNAQUOI steadied
between horses passing the three-eighths pole, came three wide into the stretch, and rallied with good courage. LEXINTONIA hugged the rail throughout,
finished evenly and prevailed in a late scramble for the show. RISING BELLA lacked room and steadied back at the start, came two wide into the stretch,
moved out for clearance entering the final furlong and was going well at the finish. CAPTAIN SAM sprinted clear early, showed the way inside to the stretch,
and yielded a sixteenth out. MERSEYSIDE raced three to four wide on the turn, and made no appreciable headway on the far outside. SIMPLIFY (ARG)
was four wide entering the turn, and moved inside while dropping back approaching the lane.

Footnotes
MR MATUSCHEK was in range two wide early, advanced three wide around the far turn, seized command near the quarter pole, drew off in upper stretch
and held clear under a drive. GUN OF GLORY saved ground in range, tipped out in upper stretch and finished willingly. VIKING PLUNDER raced four wide
in midpack and stayed on to gain the show without threatening the top two. PERFECT ENOUGH was bumped at the start, raced well back two wide, went
four wide around the far turn and improved position in the lane. CUY saved ground in midpack, took some awkward strides nearing the first turn, was rank
inside around that bend, angled out to go three wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. GOT FLOFFY cleared off early, set the pace along the rail to the
quarter pole and tired. TONE FEELIN reared at the start, raced far back inside, swung out nearing the lane and never threatened. LIQUID LOUIE was
outrun inside. GRAN PATRON saved ground and failed to menace. JOYFUL SURPRISE stalked the pace two wide, bid nearing the far turn then stopped
midway around the bend. LIL JOJO was bumped at the start and played no further factor while racing three wide. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE START AND TOOK NO ACTION AFTER RULING THAT TONE FEELIN CAUSED HIS OWN TROUBLE.
