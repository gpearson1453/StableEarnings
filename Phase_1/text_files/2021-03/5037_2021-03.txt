Footnotes
WILL DANCER stumbled at the start, quickly regrouped to chase the pacesetter into the backstretch and second turn, swung three wide into the stretch and
made a late kick to prevail. FORT YORK showed early speed to assume command of the pace, saved ground along the backstretch and second turn, began
to tire in midstretch, was passed by WILL DANCER but held on to second. SOUTHEAST ASIA sat off of the early pace from a two wide position along the
backstretch and second turn, was asked for run in the stretch and made a mild late run to pass GOOCH EXPRESS for third. GOOCH EXPRESS saved
ground while off pace early, was engaged in the stretch late by SOUTHEAST ASIA and was nipped on the line by that rival for third. LINGUA FRANCA was
unhurried early, settling at the rear of the field, traveled three wide along the second turn, and had no late bid in the stretch. HERDSMAN was unhurried
early, settling toward the rear of the field, saved ground in the two path along the second turn and had no late response for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MUNN SHE'S PRETTY was hustled to set early fractions, saved ground through the backstretch and second turn, was asked for run entering the stretch
and kicked clear. DIAMETRIC chased the leader while two wide down the backstretch and into the second turn, narrowed the margin a bit on the turn but
was not able to reel in MUNN SHE'S PRETTY in the drive, while still second best. OLIVE YOU MORE settled midpack in the early stages while traveling
three wide down the backstretch, came under a ride along the second turn, and finished evenly in the stretch for third. LIVIN' AT THE BU settled toward the
rear of the field in the early stages while saving ground in the two path, continued to save ground into the stretch but had no late response in the drive.
SQUARE DREAMER was fanned four wide on the first turn, angled over to the two path for the run down the backstretch, continued saving ground along
the second turn, and was not a factor late.

MOON ROCKET set early fractions from a ground saving trip, was confronted by REAL KEEPER midstretch but dug in in the final sixteenth to best that
rival. REAL KEEPER chased the pacesetter from the two path through the backstretch and turn, pushed up to challenge MOON ROCKET at the eighth pole,
hung a bit while trying to pass that rival and was second best to the finish. INCREDIBLY LUCKY sat just off of the early pace while saving ground two wide,
began advancing position along the turn, slipped to the rail for the drive and made a mild late rally to get third. STARZA was three wide down the
backstretch and into the turn while just off of the early pace, lost position coming into the stretch and finished evenly. AROUSE N GO settled mid flight early
while traveling four wide, lost position along the turn and had no late response in the drive. MOONSHINE ANNIE was unhurried early, settling three wide at
the rear of the field through the backstretch run and onto the turn, was asked for run entering the stretch and had no late rally in the stretch.

EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER was outrun to the turn, bid four wide then swung out widest for the drive, closed with a rush in the final sixteenth and won going
away. SQUARE DEAL dueled for the lead outside LET'S REJOYCE, battled that one through a prolonged drive, was caught late by the winner but gamely
got the -place. LET'S REJOYCE was on the pace inside of SQUARE DEAL, dueled to the stretch, dug in determinedly, was overtaken by the winner and
lost the nod for second. JESS MO got outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then shifted out for the drive and was gaining steadily. EEL
POINT broke a bit slow, had no speed, was three wide on the turn then shifted out in upper stretch, had to shift out again leaving the furlong grounds and
was also closing well. OUR BOLD PRINCE tracked the leaders to the turn, was two wide to the stretch but was outfinished in the drive. TORPEDO AWAY
chased the pace three wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. WINE AND WHISKY had no speed and was never a threat.

Footnotes
NO PARKING HERE pressed PEQUENO MONTE two wide, moved up to engage for the lead into the stretch, inched clear to mid stretch and held
determinedly. PEQUENO MONTE was sent hard for the lead, set the pace from the rail, responded to mid stretch then held the place. COLLUSION
DELUSION stalked the leaders to the turn, came three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task to the line. IMPERATOR was
chasing early, raced two wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. MONSTRODAMOUS was outsprinted to the turn, came three wide to the
stretch but also did not rally. GOT TOBE AWESOME had no speed, was four wide on the turn and not a factor. INSANIAMANIA was always outrun.
