ALWAYS A TIZ vied for the early lead from the inside and prevailed under all out pressure. DREAMINGNDIAMONDS pressed the leader while racing two
deep and finished gamely to the wire to just miss. SAWYOUINOURDREAM stalked the top pair, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and finished willingly
to the wire. ABLE CATCH was hustled throughout, raced three deep in the lane and had not enough in the drive. ONE LITTLE INDY dropped back early,
raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no rally. MUWAAN MAT was slow early, raced five deep in the stretch and had no response. BETWEEN THE

Footnotes
TOP STAR was allowed to settle early on, made a strong move nearing the far turn and was well clear in the drive under a steady hand ride. GOOD BOY
ROY showed good speed along the inside and was no match for the winner. OUR HALF FIRST was unhurried early, moved up five wide through the lane
and showed late interest. BER MIS BOY stalked the early pace, raced six wide at the eighth pole and had no final winning bid. SUPER MOTION raced four
wide into the upper stretch and had no late response. DIRTY DEEDS raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. HOT ARTIE was slow
early and never threatened. ATWATER was slow early, saved ground and never was a factor. NORTHCOUNTY WILLY failed to respond. BACK TO BLACK
showed brief foot from the inside and tired readily.

U S S LOIS was allowed to settle in the early stages, moved up five wide through the lane and finished well to get up under strong handling. DISTINCT
FLIRT pressed the leader from the inside and finished second best. FIVE B C stalked the pace, raced four wide in the lane and finished willingly to the wire.
QUESTION MARKIE set all the pace from the outside and weakened in the drive. DREAMING ABOUT YOU was slow early, raced seven wide into the
upper stretch and never was a factor. KURIOUS KENNEDY was unhurried early and failed to respond. COMPLETE SENSE stalked the pace and
weakened along the inside. STRIKE PERFECTION raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. MISS ELISE failed to menace.
COUNTESS ST MICHEL drifted a bit around the first turn, was pulled up and walked off the track under her own power.

Footnotes

pace, moved up along the inside and finished second best. ALEUTIAN HARBOUR settled off the early pace, moved up four wide through the lane and had
not enough in the drive. WHATA PERFECT DAY was unhurried early, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and made a mild late gain. FLANAGAN stalked
the pace along the inside and had no late response. ARCH SEEKER raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. ARCH'S WILD vied for
the early lead and gave way. MISS ORATORY failed to respond. DRAX was slow early and never threatened. MAJOR BIZKIT was hustled along and tired
readily.
