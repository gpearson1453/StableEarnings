Footnotes
FAST VERDICT was well position down the backstretch, moved from the inside to the three path while stalking the leading duo on the turn, rallied four wide
into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the three-sixteenths while still on his inside lead, shook clear into the final furlong, swapped to the
proper lead while drawing away outside the sixteenth-pole then was eased up late while much the best. DIAMOND PALACE disputed the pace on the
outside then in the three path on the turn, battled under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match for the winner while able to get the place.
CRYPTOZONIC was coaxed along just off the pace, dropped back while three then four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, chased
outside into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. DISAPPROVAL was bumped at the start and forced in then checked
badly, spotted the front many lengths, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop, moved out into the final furlong, dropped back in
late and lacked the needed response. TOO MUCH BOURBON settled outside under some urging, went five wide on the turn, was driven six wide into the
stretch and failed to respond. SLAM'S MAN showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path while still inside that rival on
the turn, was put to the crop near the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. CAT ON THE ROOF broke in and bumped with a foe,
was taken in hand near the five-eighths then settled at the rear, went four then three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. RICHARD RONALD chased the
pace on the outside, dropped back four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
TREYS MIDNITE MOON rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, went around the far turn in the three path, was roused while
wheeling five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead outside the furlong marker, shook clear inside that marker and proved best under steady
handling. RUN TAPPY was last to commence, angled in at the rear, saved ground on the turns, was put to the crop while gaining in upper stretch, came
between horses late and got up for the place. ZANESVILLE was hustled from the start, raced in the two path on the first turn, was rated off the pace, came
under urging while three wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop, chased in the drive and just missed the place while able to get the
show. OVERZEALOUS broke out at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged four wide early on the far turn then moved to
the six path and failed to rally. LATE NITE MISCHIEF was hustled to the lead, set the clear pace on the inside, was asked after straightening for the drive,
lost the advantage to the winner outside the furlong marker and tired. CAP ROCK MINER went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside,
dropped back midway down the backstretch, came up empty while four then five wide on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
NO PEDIGREE bumped with a rival at the start, showed good speed and set the pace, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, was asked outside
the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, responded well when put to a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker and held under strong
urging. WAR SAVVY was away alertly from the outside post, chased the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner under a
drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. JANETS JAY JAY raced just off the pace, was taken up while rank midway down the backstretch,
dropped back near the seven-sixteenths, went around the turn in the three path, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly to
clearly secure the show. LT. BONURA was well placed just off the pace, dropped back under urging while inside on the turn and came up empty. GALLANT
STAR bumped twice with a foe at the start, was taken up near the five-eighths then climbed into the kickback behind horses, moved out under tight restraint
around the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path while let out, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CUSTOM
BOBBY'S bumped twice with an opponent at the start, raced just off the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn and capitulated. GOT KRAMER
broke out and was away awkwardly then bumped with a foe, settled near the back, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no
factor.

Footnotes
SCHMOOZIN broke a half-step slow, angled in while settling off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused while cutting the corner into the stretch,
rallied along the rail into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. BREW CREW disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path
while still inside that foe on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, dueled with ESTABLISHED until outside the sixteenth-pole, disposed of that foe
at that point, drifted in closer to the winner under a right-handed crop late and was caught by the winner while clear for the place. ESTABLISHED was
hustled from the start, contested the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, dueled outside of the runner-up until nearing the sixteenth-pole
then was out-kicked while clear for the show. TAP ATTACK chased the pace down the backstretch, moved from two to three wide early on the turn, shifted
out while put to a drive in upper stretch, drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. GHOSTLINER settled off the early pace then
was taken in hand around the nine-sixteenths, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, chased under a drive into the final
furlong and weakened. BENBOW CAT chased the pace on the outside, went five wide for most of the turn, dropped back near the five-sixteenths, moved to
the four then three path outside the quarter-pole and tired. LOVE ME ARCHIE broke a bit slow, settled at the rear, went two to three wide on the turn and
was no factor.

five-sixteenths then four wide shortly thereafter, rallied outside into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead at the three-sixteenths then kicked clear, swapped
back to her inside lead when given a couple taps of a down-turned crop coming to the furlong marker then widened under a hand ride to win ridden out.

into the final furlong and was no match for the winner but showed good courage to hold the show. TIZ SUSAN ANN broke out then was corrected by the

the turn and failed to threaten. HAVE NO FEAR pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and

Footnotes
COWBOY DIPLOMACY went four to five wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the three path on the far turn, took
the lead coming to the quarter-pole, responded well when set down in upper stretch, battled outside the runner-up into the final furlong, drifted out near the
sixteenth-pole then was straightened by the rider and proved best while placed under a hand ride to the wire. SIR ALFRED JAMES broke out a bit then was
hustled to the lead, set the pace in the two path, was asked under threat on the far turn, lost the advantage to the winner approaching the quarter-pole,
fought on with the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished while just able to get the place. SPRAWL was caught five to six wide for most of the first
turn then dropped to the three path, was rated off the pace, went three wide on the far turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive in
upper stretch then drifted further out before being straightened at the furlong marker and improved position to just miss the place while clear for the show.
BLUE JAYS went three to four wide on the turns and failed to threaten. PIT BOSS went four wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace, chased four wide
on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and tired. EXTRAORDINARY was well placed just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the rail on
the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole and came up empty. HARVEY WALLBANGER went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear,
was urged two then three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, moved further out under a drive around the three-sixteenths and failed to

Footnotes
LADY ANNA moved out early, settled comfortably off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was asked every so slightly at the five-sixteenths, gained four
wide into the stretch, cruised to the lead nearing the three-sixteenths then shook clear under a couple very light shakes of the reins and drew away with the
rider poised like a statue in the irons to win handily. DAWN'S DANCER was reserved off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was let out with three furlongs
to run then roused into upper stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. AMERICAN LEGEND bobbled slightly at the start, settled
outside under some urging, was roused four wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. COBRA CASABLANCA sped clear
early and opened up a sizable lead, remained clear in the two path through the turn, spun three wide with a diminishing lead into the stretch then was asked,
lost the advantage to the winner at the three-sixteenths and tired.
