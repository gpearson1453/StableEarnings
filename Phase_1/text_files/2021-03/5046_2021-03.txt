Footnotes
JUST A BIT SASSY was rated stalking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, continued to make a steady advance on the pacesetter entering the
far turn, bid for command nearing upper stretch and drove clear. WHISPERING ROSE settled outside a rival in the last flight dropping well off the leaders,
commenced a three wide advance midway through the far turn and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors at the wire. MELISSANI, in
touch prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, took over after a half, dictated the pace to the second bend, resisted the winner's challenge past
midstretch but yielded late. LAPULGA settled last along the inside, switched out racing into the far turn but offered no rally. GIPSEY SORCERESS, urged
along the inside disputing the pace from the outset to the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the leaders once headed into the far turn but gave way nearing
the lane.

BUMBLELICIOUS, caught in tight quarters at the start, settled off the first flight racing through the backstretch, steadily gathered momentum shifting out four
wide nearing upper stretch, moved to challenge for command in that path nearing the sixteenth marker, then took over and went clear with a sustained
response under firm left handed encouragement. CATCH THE RAINBOW joined the pace four wide racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue three
deep into upper stretch gaining a narrow advantage but proved no match when confronted by the winner. OB LA DI exchanged some contact with ADIOS
DEE DEE at the start, was quickly righted, then urged between foes disputing the pace, dueled into upper stretch and weakened leaving the furlong marker.
ADIOS DEE DEE exchanged bumps at the start, was urged three deep between foes disputing the pace into the turn but gave way leaving the midway point
of the bend. TRULY A DREAM, urged inside foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, dueled inside foes on the turn and
gave way abruptly racing into upper stretch. MY DIRTY MARTINI settled along the inside racing to the turn and failed to gain striking distance.

Footnotes
REMARKABLE SILVER was rated outside rivals in second flight in the opening half, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and produced a solid late
response to wrest command and go clear under firm handling. NEW YORK COMMANDER was settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, shifted outside foes entering the far turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and rallied for the place honors in the closing stages. SIGNING
BONUS was rated between foes, then along the inside racing as part of the second flight to the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch,
split foes to advance along the inside entering upper stretch but was outkicked for second. ANDIAMA stalked the leaders along the inside in early stages,
switched out after a half to advance three deep racing into the far turn, moved to gain a clear advantage nearing upper stretch but failed to sustain that
momentum. DINNER FOR TWO tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch but lacked the
needed closing bid. NANIE'S TREASURE, forwardly placed attending the pace in the opening half, was prompted to make a brief bid between foes entering
the far turn but gave way racing into the lane. JAENT settled off the second flight along the inside but never mounted a serious challenge.
BILLYSBIRTHDAYGIRL, urged to the lead along the inside, set the pace racing to the far turn and gave way abruptly into upper stretch. PALOMA MIA was
settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
STRIKING HEIR broke readily, prompted a rival's pace through the backstretch, moved clear midway through the turn, held sway a bit off the rail past
midstretch and was kept to firm right handed pressure to hold DIVINE AMBITION on a safe margin to the end. The latter broke in the air, quickly recovered
pulling his way to position three deep between foes in second flight racing through the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path on the turn to the
stretch with a steady bid but proved only second best. RATTLESNAKE RIDGE, urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace through the backstretch
into the turn, continued in pursuit of that foe but weakened entering upper stretch. FRIENDLY FELLA, bumped at the start, was rated inside rivals as part of
the second flight racing through the backstretch, switched out on the turn but steadily faded into the lane. SACRAMENTO Q settled outside foes racing four
deep on the backstretch and offered no rally. ED'S DOG broke inwards bumping a rival, was righted to track off the first flight between foes but dropped out
early.

Footnotes
GAMBLING CAT, held up in the opening stages, was rated outside a rival just off the second flight to the backstretch, shifted out three deep midway through
the far turn commencing a steady advance, moved to wrest the advantage nearing the sixteenth marker and edged clear in time under firm handling. AGOG
angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, inherited the lead racing into upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner in
the closing stages. ENTWINE (IRE) settled out of tight quarters racing last to the backstretch, swung out four wide nearing the lane and continued willingly
in that path to close the gap on the top pair late. COOL FRONT sped to the lead along the inside, set the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the far turn,
bore out leaving the quarter mile marker and gave out entering the stretch. COOL O TOOLE was rated off the second flight inside a rival racing to the
backstretch but lacked a closing response. SUCCESSFUL LEGACY, pulled her way way to a forward position prompting the pacesetter into the backstretch,
couldn't match terms with that foe entering the far turn and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CUMBERLAND AVENUE tracked off the first flight racing four wide through the backstretch, made a steady advance in that path through the turn to upper
stretch to challenge for command leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm encouragement. VIGO angled to the inside tracking off the first flight
racing through the backstretch, shifted out racing into upper stretch and responded to brisk handling to split foes three wide in the final stages to narrowly
prevail for the place honors. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA was settled last while shifting out five wide on the backstretch, continued in that path into upper stretch
and produced a belated response to close the gap outside foes while prevailing for a share. LIL GREEN MACHINE, urged prompting the pace between foes
in the opening stages, gained a narrow advantage racing into the turn while remaining a bit off the rail, set the pace to midstretch but was collared late.
VALEROSO, urged along three wide pursuing the leaders through the backstretch into the turn, closed the gap on the leader between foes nearing the lane
but came up empty in late stretch. MAN OF MEN broke awkwardly while ducking inwards momentarily dislodging his rider from his irons and never gained
contention. VET'S GIFT, urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch gave way after the opening quarter.

Footnotes
DONNAMEUP, in touch, prompting the pacesetter from the outset to the backstretch, pressed the issue nearing the far turn, took over nearing upper stretch
and just maintained the lead to the end under firm encouragement to prevail. SPEED SALSA tracked the leaders inside a rival as part of the second flight
racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, tipped out three wide racing through the stretch and continued willingly to the end to close the gap
while edging a rival for the place honors. PRINCESS JAVONCIA, urged to dictate the pace along the inside from the outset to the far turn, dueled inside the
winner into upper stretch but weakened in late stages to miss for second. LOVELY TROPHY GIRL switched out three deep early tracking off the second
flight, angled to the rail entering the far turn and saved ground to the lane while finishing evenly late. LONG STORY SHORT settled while angling inside in
the opening half, angled out four wide nearing upper stretch and gained some position while making no real impression. STRICT VOW, off slowly, switched
out to gain some position four wide after a half, then continued evenly into the lane. PEARLS FOR JOSIE tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to
the far turn and steadily faded nearing upper stretch. SUGAR BRITCHES settled last to the far turn, angled out six wide racing into upper stretch but offered
no rally. A FOOLISH FANCY tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch but steadily faded after a half. BIZ MAKER angled to the inside
early, soon dropped out and raced seven wide through late stretch.

Footnotes
BATTLE RAGS tracked off the second flight three deep between foes racing through the backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting out four wide on the
turn, then continued with a steady late response racing past midstretch to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. SOUL REFLECTION tracked just
off the pacesetter outside a rival in the opening stages, steadily advanced three wide pressing the issue to strike the front nearing upper stretch, held sway
past the furlong marker but couldn't contain the winner. LOGSDON, shuffled back after the break avoiding tight quarters, was prompted to split foes three
wide racing into the turn, angled out five wide entering the lane and found his best stride late to close the gap on the top pair. VEGAS LIFE tracked off the
second flight between foes racing to the turn, split rivals just off the inside entering the stretch to challenge inside the leader but had no final kick. PRETTY
CHITU, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter, was prompted to lodge a brief bid between foes on the turn but flattened out nearing midstretch.
FIRST HOMESTEAD tracked off the second flight between foes, was shuffled a bit avoiding close quarters nearing the turn, then continued between foes
into the lane but offered no rally. SIR HIGGINS tracked off the second flight inside foes into the turn but lacked a closing response. IMPERIAL IVOR, caught
in tight quarters at the start, was held up last while angling to the inside and never gained contention while splitting foes in late stages to gain some position
in hand nearing the wire. CONGRATS THAT, urged to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage racing to the turn, then gave way
once headed nearing upper stretch. EXCLUSIVE DONALD tracked off the second flight racing five wide into the turn and steadily faded nearing upper
stretch.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY GHOST, prompted to a forward placing racing four wide leaving the chute, shifted inwards to track outside a rival as part of the second flight,
was prompted to make a steady advance outside a rival on the far turn, moved to terms with the pacesetter nearing midstretch, wrested the advantage to go
clear under firm handling and was gathered up nearing the wire. RED STORM RISEN, urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing into the first turn,
was prompted to go well clear after a half, held sway on a commanding advantage to upper stretch, was roused to resist the winner's bid but proved no
match late. ROUGH NIGHT, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace, conceded some ground to that foe after a half, was urged to advance in tandem with
the eventual winner racing into the far turn, switched out three deep entering the lane and continued well enough to prevail for a share. IDLE TIME, forced in
at the start, settled along the inside to the backstretch, then continued with an effort to improved position between foes into the lane. I AM THAT I AM,
bumped at the start, then caught wide racing to the first turn, angled out five wide entering the lane and made an effort to gain some position late.
SIMMARDSTRIKE tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the far turn but offered no closing bid. SECLUDE, in a bit tight in the opening stages,
tracked between foes to the backstretch, shifted out to race four wide between rivals into the lane but had no rally. BATTLE CREEK broke awkwardly, was
settled last to the far turn and proved no threat. RECORDER tracked the leaders inside a rival in second flight to the backstretch and steadily faded on the
far turn. THAT'S BUCKBEAK broke inwards bumping I AM THAT I AM, then ducked inwards while racing rank under restraint between foes just off the
inside to the backstretch and soon dropped out.
