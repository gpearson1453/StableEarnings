Footnotes
WAR PLAYER raced within striking distance, moved up around the turn, entered the stretch wide, rallied down the stretch and proved the best. SILKY'S
DANCE pressed the early pace, raced outside around the turn and was outfinished for the win. AKHNAS broke a step slow, racing from the back, made a
late gain, split rivals down the stretch and finished willingly. NO QUARTER raced near the back in the beginning, came around the turn wide, made a mild
bid, but was no factor. BIG BAND'S LUCK broke out, went to the front and faded down the home stretch. DESIARD challenged for the early lead, saved
ground and dropped back. HOPE FOR CHANGE void of early speed and was never a threat.

HARLONS COMMISION dueled for the early advantage, drove clear around the turn and won under urging. PALMETTOVOWMENOT raced in the middle of
the field, came around the turn three wide, rallied down the lane, closed ground on the winner and proved best of others. IRISH PRIORITY raced within
contention, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the top two, but held on for the show. SOUTHERN DUDETTE raced within striking distance,
saved ground and was outfinished for third. DIXIELAND FLASH raced evenly near the back and was no threat. NO NO NO challenged for the early lead and
was finished early. MARQUEE MOMENT raced evenly in the rear and was never close. WANDERNINTHEFOREST trailed throughout and showed nothing.

couldn't catch the winner, but was a clear second. QUALITY PRODUCTION was an early factor, raced close throughout, while finishing on the rail and
lacked a finish. HE'S AN HONEST MAN lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. BEAUTY BOY raced evenly near the back and was never
a threat. MR. GRACEFUL void of early speed and showed little. ACTIF ONE pressed the early pace and dropped to the back.

Footnotes
GREATEST LOVE challenged for the early lead, dueled throughout and prevailed for the win. FOUR PRINCESSES broke in, vied for the lead, dueled
throughout and was outfinished for the win. DARPA raced within contention, had an outside trip, couldn't keep up with the top two late, but was best of
others. C C'S BABY GIRL raced near the back, was rank around the first turn, trying to get out, improved position and finished evenly. HERO OF GOLD
shuffled back at the start and was never a threat. MAJESTIC EDGE lacked early speed, saved ground around the final turn and showed little. NANCY'S
RESCUE broke sharp, flashed brief speed, dropped back and was pulled up. Walked off.
