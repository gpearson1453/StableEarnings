Footnotes
FRICKA bore in jamming rival at the break, fired out of the turn surging tin the three path down the lane blowing past a tiring leader late. LEXY ANNA broke
sharply setting the pace on a healthy lead to upper stretch, began to shorten stride in mid stretch ceding the lead somehow holding up for place. QUEEN
AIR was jammed and forced to check hard when rival bore in at the break, rushed to recover chased through the turn wavering in upper stretch finishing
evenly to best the others. SARAH JANE a step slow on the outside was hustled five wide to upper stretch improving a bit there. PISTOL PACKIN BOS
chased early then weakened on the turn. BOOGIE BOOGEE played no factor. TRUE LIGHT chased a loose leader through the turn tiring in upper stretch.
PALI'S REWARD was always outrun. FORMER BUNNY showed little. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF QUEEN AIR AGAINST THE RIDER OF
FRICKA FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE BREAK WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MIKEY prompted the pace coming between horses into upper stretch dueling inside of foe late being put in close digging deep to prevail. PLAY
BALL in close would angle out early rallying on the turn coming three deep from mid track in upper stretch moving abreast foe in the final yards trying to
tighten rival to no avail. EVEN KEELED slow early saved ground to upper stretch finishing well along the rail. PRIVATE DRIVE pressed the pace dueling
inside of rivals to upper stretch weakening late. NICK CAN FIX slow early gave an even finish to improve a bit. OAKEN raced mid pack failing to mount a
bid. FUNNEL CAKE hustled along would tire. CHARLEE'S MAGIC was never involved. SWEETNESSNCHARM gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
ROSKILDE sent clear set the pace shaking clear in upper stretch needing all to hold late. DAD'S YANKEES pressed on the turn extending into upper stretch
bidding gamely in the last yards. SILENT TIGER chased the pace racing evenly to upper stretch surging in the final yards. SHACKLESON hustled along
pursued close up through the turn wavering a bit the final eighth. KEYED ON TOP slow early lagged on the turn before finding stride after the fact.
SUNNY'S STORM raced evenly needing more late. IRISH CAT raced mid pack vying on the inside in upper stretch hanging late. ASTRO JAK played no
factor. KING DADDIO vied on the turn then gave way in upper stretch. KENTUCKY KITTEN was always outrun.
