Footnotes
SHECANFLATOUTPLAY took quick control to rate a short lead inside, was pressured a bit into the far turn and widened through the turn, then taken in
hand the final sixteenth. KINKY FROLIC stalked off the rail then picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, though, proved no match. CASTLE
REVIEW hesitated at the break and raced off the early pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn
and showed little more. UNEXPECTEDLY settled back off the rail, faded past the five sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn.

runner-up. BLAME IT ON HONEY broke outward to make contact with Thisisthetimetowin then picked up the chase, raced at the rail on the turn and ran
evenly down the lane. TWOBITSARIDE raced well back inside, rounded the turn off the rail, angled out into the lane and passed a rival.
THISISTHETIMETOWIN was bumped outward and into Truffles And Gold, gave chase through the backstretch then weakened past the five sixteenths pole.

J J WEDGIT MAN settled off the earlier pace about the three path, bid approaching the three eighths pole, was carried out toward the top of the stretch and
left the turn about the five path, then dug in to take over just inside the sixteenth pole. ANY WAY NOW raced off the pace and off the rail, bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole and closed to the lead two deep midway on the far turn, drifted toward the head of the lane and dug in with the advantage to late
stretch before flattening stride. NORTHERN RIDGE saved ground off the pace the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, bid toward the five
sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and was just up for third. NAUTICAL WARRIOR angled to the rail and rated a long early lead, came
under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn then weakened the final sixteenth. RUCKER saved ground.

Footnotes
ALPINE MOON took the lead approaching the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the three
eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dueled clear inside the eighth pole and was steadily encouraged through the lane.
SHERWOOD LADY settled off the early pace just off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn but
dropped back inside the eighth pole and flattened stride later yards. LONGSTORYLUCY saved ground off the pace, bid approaching the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened in the lane. SECRET CASTLE stalked off the rail, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and raced in
the three path of the far turn, then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. GAB'S LIL LEAGUER broke a bit awkwardly and settled back off the rail the first
turn, then showed little response through the backstretch.

FIBER AND EMILY took the lead between horses nearing the first turn and rated a short lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn at the rail and was steadily handled down the lane. RUSH TO THE CASTLE stumbled to his nose leaving the gate and settled off the
pace off the rail the opening turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and improved in the three and four paths of the far turn, dueled for second
mid-stretch and finished well while gaining on the winner. OPERA NITE stalked inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced close at the rail on the
far turn then dueled through the stretch to take third from AARON'S TAP at the wire, while the latter settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn then
eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled close in the three path of the far turn, flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole and
was nipped from third under the wire. WILLIAM AND MARY rounded the first turn in the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the
chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the three path the far turn and showed little more. FAIRWEATHER FRIEND stalked from the three path, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole, though, weakened at the rail on the far turn.

TALENT EXPECTED accelerated to the front approaching the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, widened at the rail on the turn and was
steadily handled to hold on well. ETERNAL HEART chased the earlier pace toward the inside, rounded the turn just off the rail, drifted to the four path
leaving the turn and finished evenly. MISS WAVE chased and rounded the turn off the rail, eased outward in the upper stretch, closed for third mid-stretch
and finished well while gaining on the top two. CHARITABLE ANY chased inside but steadied while boxed off the heels of Eternal Heart past the five
sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened. JUBA'S HOUSE gave chase outside, raced in the four path of the turn and showed little more.
TIZ THE REASON pressured the pace from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened while losing ground on the turn.

Footnotes
PARTLY DANDY exchanged contact with Anchor's Firstlady leaving the gate and was checked while in tight early, stalked into the backstretch, rallied from
the mid point of the far turn and came between horses past the eighth pole, took the lead mid-stretch and dug in determinedly to earn the nod. ANGELS
CASTLE was hustled outside through the front stretch and entered the first turn in the five path, stalked into the backstretch then bid toward the three
eighths pole, took a slim lead midway on the far turn and dueled gamely to the finish, although, missed the nod through the final strides. SING FROSTY
exchanged contact with Partly Dandy at the break and settled off the pace in the three and four paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, had range on the
lead in the four path of the far turn, dug in to take third mid-stretch and finished evenly. SONDE AFFAIR saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, angled to the six path on the far turn and finished well. MISS MORGANTOWN stalked the earlier pace about the three path then took the
lead into the backstretch, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was caught midway on the far turn and weakened the final furlong.
COWGIRL ETCH raced off the pace and off the rail the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and
showed little more. CASTLE'S TUFFY raced well back while saving early ground and showed little response through the backstretch. CREATIVE
SPLENDOR raced with the early pace inside then stalked into the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, though faded on the far
turn. ITSI BITSI was not a factor. ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY broke outward to exchange contact with Partly Dandy and was hustled with the pace through the
front stretch, took the lead into the first turn but was caught into the backstretch, gave chase from that point, checked from tight quarters at the rail in the
vicinity of the quarter pole then weakened at the rail.
