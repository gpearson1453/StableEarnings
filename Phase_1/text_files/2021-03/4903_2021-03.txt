AMIGOS TUNE dueled two wide from the outset, moved clear after five furlongs and held under mild urging. PRECIOUS lagged early, advanced two wide
between rivals on the turn then closed a gap in the final yards. TARA'S TALENT was slow early, raced three wide around the turn and finished with good
energy. KAYLASAURUS was slow to settle, stayed inside and made up some ground late. FLATTERING RUBY dueled inside the winner for over five
furlongs then weakened. LOVELY LYDIA chased the dueling leaders to the stretch then tired. MY LILLY PAD pulled up after suffering a catastrophic injury
to her left front leaving the half-mile pole then was walked into the horse ambulance.

GEM JUAN trailed early, circled into the stretch and was along in time. FIELD OFFICER was slow early, swung wide into the stretch, loomed boldly late but
was outfinished. LO Z ROLLS moved to a short lead leaving the furlong grounds, dueled through the lane and faltered. CIN CIN COWBOY bobbled leaving
the gate, advanced outside early, was wide into the stretch and lacked the needed closing. MORE LEVEL was clear soon after the break, drew far out on
the turn then stopped in the lane.
