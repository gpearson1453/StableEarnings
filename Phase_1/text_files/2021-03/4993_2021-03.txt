Footnotes
INDAWIN in the second flight while off the inside, ranged up closer three wide in the second turn, chased the runner up into the lane, engaged that one from
the outside with less than a furlong remaining, dueled, edged clear late under steady handling. HENNY FLY prompted the issue in hand from the outside,
advanced and engaged the leader into the far turn, dueled through much of the bend, clear into the lane, responded when the winner came alongside inside
the furlong grounds, gave ground grudgingly to that one late. JULIE ARKANSAS pulled hard when forwardly placed along the inside, continued under
restraint, moved out a bit turning for home, proved no match for the top pair the final furlong, well clear of the rest. SANTA ANA WINDS off a step slow,
trailed much of the way, three wide into the lane, improved position without posing a serious threat. MIDNIGHT KARMA broke on top, set the early pace
under stout restraint, briefly dueled along the inside with the runner up, began to weaken when headed by that one midway on the final turn.
SATTERSFIELD went one paced throughout while racing three wide. CITY GONE COUNTRY in mid pack off the rail, had nothing for the drive. ALL IN
BRONSON was always outrun.

Footnotes
ROCK RIDGE away in good order, showed the way early just off the inside, clear through the turn, crew off through the lane without being asked for his best
to win ridden out. GAINER back off the early pace, moved out to be three wide midway on the turn, tipped four wide and between foes turning for home,
long drive for the pace while not a threat to the winner. THAT DUDE settled in mid pack toward the inside, remained in the two path through the turn,
outfinished for the place while closest to the inside of the second flight. MORAL STANDARD within striking distance off the inside, four wide through the
turn, floated out five wide for the drive, weakened in the final furlong. PONTI POKER off a step slow, trailed for a half, came three wide into the lane,
improved position with some late interest, not a serious threat. HARRY chased the winner while off the inside, faltered. BEGGARTHYSTAR void of early
foot off the inside, made little impact. AXIS back off the pace well wide, five wide early in the turn, faded. SAMURAI SAINT staged a steady retreat along the
inside.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE ERICA close from the start, narrowly set the pace off the inside, headed through the turn in the two path, continued to do battle past the
furlong marker, found more late while between rivals to prove best in game fashion. SHACKLEFORD COUNTY broke a bit to the outside, pressed the
winner early inside, put a head in front through the turn, continued to hold a narrow advantage through past midstretch, outkicked in the late going while
holding sway for the place. SANDY SANGRIA pressed early outside, bit closer while three wide through the turn, contested the issue outside the top two
past the furlong marker, could not match that pair late, clear of the others. SUNSET PAULA JO went one paced in the two path behind the first flight, lacked
a closing punch in the drive. BOATHOUSE VIEW raced three wide and in the second flight, lacked a closing kick. MADISON WAY in the second flight while
racing outside, four wide through the turn, also failed to muster a rally.

RICHNESS away in good order, five wide turn when advancing, engaged the leader inside the furlong marker, wore that one down under firm handling.
HAMAZING LACE pressed early, dueled through the turn, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, late duel, outkicked. SAILAWAY AND
HIDE steadied while rank at the start, lacked speed early along the inside, moved out a bit when advancing late in the dropped back to the rail and was up
late for the show. COURTNEY FAY off a step slow, saved some ground through the turn, two path into lane, traffic upper stretch, moved out, improved
position while too late. MARCIAMARCIAMARCIA broke alertly, narrowly set the early pace, briefly got clear early in the turn, dueled into the stretch, faltered
the final furlong. EPWORTH back off the pace and the inside, three out to four wide late in the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing
response. MORNING VALENTINE within striking distance just off the inside, came three wide into the lane, had nothing left for the drive. MORO MAGIC
back off the pace while racing outside, three wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally when called on. MISS CHECKMARK raced in mid pack for a half,
gave way in the drive. PRINCESS STRATEGY off a step slow, remained always back. RED ROCKET GIRL chased the pace early off the inside, gave way
late in the turn, eased into the lane, eased, jogged in, walked off.

Footnotes
PIONEER SPIRIT broke on top, set the pace toward the inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, responded when the runner up moved closer late in the
final turn, held that foe at bay the length of the stretch while under steady handling. CHRIS AND DAVE pressed the winner from the outside, moved a bit
closer turning for home, fell back off that same rival when straightened for home, clearly second best. COAL TRUTH within striking distance just off the
inside, came three wide into the lane, proved no match for the top two in the drive. ARRIVAL in the second flight while outside, four wide exiting the final
turn, lacked a closing kick. CASHANOVA void of speed, saved some ground, picked off a couple of rivals while not posing a threat. EASY SHOT failed to
menace while three wide entering the stretch. LAUGHING FOX off a step slow, settled off the pace and the inside, tired.

Footnotes
GOLD N SEXY broke out, bumped, quickly recovered to race closest to the early leader, took over from that one in the two path midway on the turn, clear
into the lane, drew off under a steady right handed crop. WISH FOR CANDY broke a bit to the outside, was straightened to race forwardly and off the inside
three wide through the turn, could do little with the winner through the stretch, narrowly lasted for the place. FANCY BLAZE bothered and was in tight at the
start to race back, continued to lack speed into the turn, behind some traffic turning for home, came out and soundly bumped CYBER AFFAIR entering the
stretch, was set down after recovering and closed willingly to be rapidly getting to the winner. COUVERTURE crowded and bothered at the break, lacked
speed, two path through the turn, also encountered some traffic exiting the turn, improved position when clear the final furlong. FIVE RIVERS jammed,
checked up then bobbled at the break, raced back, came five wide into the lane, improved position while remaining well out in the strip through the stretch.
ALITTLEBITOFSMARTY unruly prior to the start, lacked speed, encountered some traffic in upper stretch, steered out, little impact. BONITA'S GOLD fell
back after the start, passed tiring rivals while not a threat. LADY MONDORO pushed in, bumped start, saved ground, came up empty for the drive. CYBER
AFFAIR broke in, bothered inner foes, raced in mid pack, bumped entering the stretch off the inside, failed to rally. SKADI broke in bothering NEBRASKA
RED, was quickly straightened to set the pace, weakened when headed by the winner in the turn. NEBRASKA RED bothered at the start, moved up into a
forward position just off the inside, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
HENRYS DEAL bothered at the start, raced back while dropping to the inside, slipped through along the rail to challenge into the lane, clear past the furlong
marker, enough left to hold off the runner up. BREAK CURFEW lightly bumped at the start, raced forwardly and well off the inside, four wide through the
turn, lost ground to the winner turning into the lane, slowly getting to that one late. CROWN JEWEL bothered and was pushed out at the break, recovered to
pressure the leader in the three path and between rivals, had little left for the stretch run in proving no match for the top two, lasted for the show. CYNICAL
GIRL within striking distance while well out in the strip, five down to four wide through the bend, failed to muster a closing response. DIGGIN GOLD broke
outward but on top bothering outer rivals, was straightened to set the pace in the two path, gave way when headed by the winner entering the stretch.

Footnotes
OCEAN BREEZE lacked early foot, worked way out to be four wide by late in the turn when advancing, challenged outside the leader past the furlong
marker, briskly roused, proved best late in determined fashion. WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY forwardly placed toward the inside, traffic late in the turn, steered
out for room into the lane, brushed with LADY ROCKET upper stretch, took over past the furlong marker, dueled to the wire with the winner inside that one,
proved stubborn to the end. LADY ROCKET in mid pack while well out in the strip, bit closer three wide late in the turn, brushed with the runner up into the
lane, lacked late punch while along for the show. AUBERGE broke alertly, cleared to the inside in the run up the backstretch, continued to show the way
through the turn, faltered when headed by the runner up when straightened for home. CHERISHED prompted the pace while off the inside, had little left for
the drive. SARA SEA forwardly placed along the inside, checked up sharply when in tight quarters along the rail into the turn, fell back and did not recover.
READY TO RUNAWAY fell back after the start, trailed, no threat.

Footnotes
DINNER AT CRUMPIES never far back off the inside, bid into far turn, extended duel, drifted in under a right handed stick the final furlong, proved narrowly
best. MO BETTA broke in good order, set the pace toward but not on the inside in the two path, responded when confronted by the winner in the second
turn, dueled through midstretch, lost whip a furlong out, continued to duel to the wire, narrowly missed in a solid effort. SERBIAN SAILOR settled off the
pace inside early, moved out a bit and raced in the two path between horses second turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive. I STAN FOR LOVE
pressed the issue early along the inside, fell back, the middle half, went evenly through the lane to report home best of the others. MOON IN THE SKY void
of speed, in some traffic far turn, came three wide into the lane, managed some mild improvement with some modest late interest. DUNRAVEN PASS off
slowly, raced back, improved position with some belated interest. RISKY SITUATION broke in the air, four wide through the first turn, continued outside, four
wide again into the far turn, lacked a late kick. INTO ORBIT four wide in the first turn, tired after five furlongs. TWISTED DIXIE raced outside through the first
turn, four wide through the second turn, failed to muster a rally. KAT'S HITMAN in some traffic into the first turn, steadied midway on that bend, remained
back in failing to respond. HOSS J W was finished early while racing well wide. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH
DEEP STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.
