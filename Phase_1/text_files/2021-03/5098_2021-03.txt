unhurried early, moved up out of the turn with a four wide run to move up late to complete the super. GREENSPAN chased outside to turn, stayed on well in
stretch and faltered late. DIXIE HIGHWAY raced evenly and failed to respond when needed in the stretch. COURT AND SPARK inside to turn and never
really factored. ZACAPA RUN was off slow and never threatened. CALL WEST hustled along inside for position to turn, stayed well to stretch but tired in the

Footnotes
FLOROPLUS inside rush, bottled up into turn, waited for room, angled four wide past quarter pole and ran on gamely to prevail in a gallant effort. ALIEN
SEASON outside trip throughout while never far back, rallied through the stretch gamely but outfinished in the late going while well clear of the rest. MAJOR
WAGER chased three wide, dueled into stretch but used up and could not stay with the top pair in the final sixteenth. CAN'T SAY NO unhurried early,
moved up out of turn and stretch run to improve late. OLDZFOURFORTYTWO was reluctant to load, had the rider reunite in the gate with a sharp break,
outpaced to turn and finished up evenly in the stretch run. DR. FORMAN good speed from two path, dueled to deep stretch but faltered late. STEVIS MAN
rushed inside to the front, stayed to the half and gave way readily. BIG LEMON never factored.

Footnotes
HAUNT never far back to turn, made a bold three wide bid, responded and ran off in a sharp effort in the final furlong. VIVID VERSE never far back to turn,
made a five run into stretch for place while proving no match. POWELL inside chase, stayed evenly in the stretch run to settle for the show spot. DONNELS
CREEK chased to turn outside, could not go on and faded in the drive. BOA NOVA (IRE) had an alert start, set pace to mid stretch but faltered in late going.
DABO never a menace. ARMY SCOUT unhurried early and never reached contention.

Footnotes
MR. ELEVENTH HOUR had sharp speed, flanked leader to the turn, took over into the stretch, cleared and held sway in the final stages. OAK ROOM trailed
early on with a steady gain to the turn, angled out for clear run late and got the place spot. FREDERICKTOWN never far back with an inside stretch run for
the show spot in a good effort. ANIMAL KRACKERS inside to quarter pole, angled out into the stretch and moved up in the late going. BROADWAY JOE
never far back, raced evenly, with no late response when needed. ASHER'S MUSIC rushed inside to lead, pressured into the turn, could not go on and
faded. CREASY stayed outside to the turn with no late gain in the stretch run. OUT ONA LIMB quick start outside, stayed close to the half but gave way
readily. COPPER CROSSING was through at the half from inside. KOBE BEACH had a tardy start while far back to turn and always outrun. KING BING
HAWK never a factor with a widest stretch run to no avail. DICEMAN was through early and dropped back readily.
