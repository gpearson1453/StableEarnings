Footnotes
WEST SIDE GIRL behind the early pace while saving ground, worked way out to four wide when beginning to advance late in the second turn, came four
wide into the stretch, outside bid just inside the furlong marker, edged clear under steady handling. MELTING SNOW pressed the issue through the first turn
in the two path, dueled into and through the second bend, showed the way past the furlong marker and gave ground grudgingly to the winner late. ARTIE'S
ROSE away in good order, narrowly set the pace inside, headed then dueled through the second turn, continued to contest the issue upper stretch, also
proved a bit stubborn to the end. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME four wide when within striking distance through the first turn, fell back a bid in the run up the
backstretch, loomed up boldly to briefly challenge on the outside and again in the four path second turn, hung in the drive. GOLDEN GRANT in the second
flight, lacked a winning bid. MOONSHINE DANCING firmly in hand while behind the pace early, was four wide late in the second turn, came up empty for
the drive. MORE IS MORE worked way to the inside first turn, failed to menace.

Footnotes
HOOKED A GOODWIN took command soon after the start, set all the pace toward the inside, continued to hold a daylight advance into the stretch, held
sway late under a firm right handed crop. REINSURE broke well, chased the winner throughout to that one's outside, set down for the drive, could not get to
the winner, lasted for the place. LAUTREC within striking distance off the inside, came three wide into the lane, slowly getting to the runner up late. GAINER
settled off the pace while saving ground, lacked a serious response in the drive. MAJESTIC DAY broke well, fell back off the pace, saved all the ground
through both turns, some improvement., flattened out in the final furlong. BEAU BOOK bumped at the start, void of speed, improved position while also
saving ground much of the way. DANCE AN IRISH JIG reluctant to load, failed to menace while racing outside. FACTION off a step slow, raced in the main
body well off the pace, lacked response. SHINE JACK'S DREAM tired while racing off the inside. MORAL STANDARD bumped at the start, raced four wide
through both turns, gave way in the drive. GOT IT ALL was finished early. FILLY RAY CYRUS off slowly, remained always back.

Footnotes
FLATOYA away well, showed the way along the inside, continued to set the pace into the lane, stayed clear to the wire while being kept to task.
JUSTATAPIN angled in after an alert break, pressed the winner off the inside, proved no match for that one the final furlong, clearly second best. MS
FALSETTO settled off the pace and the inside, three wide through the turn, along for show while no match for the top two. DIXIELAND DREAM five wide
into the turn, continued outside, went one paced to the wire. SOME WOULD SAY within striking distance early along the inside, came up empty inside.
WHOVILLE four wide when behind the pace, came up empty for the drive. DULCIMER DAME failed to menace while racing off the inside. WESTERN
ATTIRE void of early speed, four wide through the turn, never a threat in the drive. LADY PRIEST checked up early from between horses, fell back and
never menaced.

Footnotes
FOUNDER'S DAY away well to be with the pace from the start, dueled into and through the turn, put the other speed away entering the stretch, shook clear
then held the runner. BABY CLOUD back off the pace toward the inside, moved out to be three wide when moving slightly closer entering the stretch, could
do little more with the winner in the run to the wire, well clear of the others. GRAN MANNA forwardly placed while out in the strip, three wide turn, finished
up best of the rest. RIGHT TRAPPE last away, trailed early, also raced in the three path around the bend, made little impact through the stretch. EMERALD
PRINCESS moved up to set the pace along the inside, gave way in the drive. VIVA VIOLENCE fractious in the gate, steadied when in tight five furlongs out,
fell back, trailed home.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA SWING outrun in the early going, moved out, advanced on the leaders with a solid three wide move turning for home, shook clear, held a
comfortable margin to the end under steady hand ride to win ridden out. CHICORY BLUE prompted the early pace in the two path, moved up to duel before
a half, briefly gained the advantage late in the second turn, offered little resistance to the winner entering the stretch, proved no match, well clear of the
others. NEVER EVEN CALLED off a step slow, raced back early, traffic when beginning to move closer late in the final turn,dropped inside for room, rallied
up the rail to annex the show, no threat to the top two. DRIVEN TO COMPETE off a step slow, trailed early, steered out four wide late in the second turn,
improved position, outfinished for the show. ROCKO'S WHEEL settled off the pace within striking distance, came up empty for the drive. KID'S MISCHIEF
four wide when toward the front into the first turn, prompted the issue from the three path up the backstretch, asked along second turn, had little left for the
stretch. HINTON in mid pack while outside, came five wide out of the final turn, lacked kick. YOU SPLIT TENS got clear early, dueled the middle part, gave
way in the drive. ALWAYS A CATCH remained always back.

Footnotes
BACK RING LUCK chased the winner early off the inside, moved up to challenge midway on the second turn from the outside, showed the way into the
stretch, was clear past the furlong marker then dug in late to just hold the runner up safe in the waning strides. COUSIN LARRY outrun in the early going,
continued back onto the backstretch, moved closer in traffic late in the second bend, shifted out slightly, challenged outside the winner late, denied.
KINETIC SKY allowed to settled off the pace and the inside, three wide when within striking distance final turn, lacked a closing punch. BIG UNION cleared
in the first turn, set the pace under stout restraint, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner in the second turn then faltered when headed by that foe soon
after. RIPTIDE ROCK off the pace, moved out, four wide through the final turn, failed to muster a rally. NOTARY fell back to trail after the start, showed little.

Footnotes
TRUE CASTLE in the second flight off the inside, crept closer in the two path late in the turn, split foes nearing the furlong marker to take command, held
late in game fashion to narrowly prevail. GHAALEB THE GREAT broke in to be last away, trailed while moving well off the inside, came five wide out of the
turn, set down, rallied down the middle of the strip, floated out by a drifting rival late, continued willingly to the end to narrowly miss. SANDY SANGRIA in the
second flight along the inside, moved a bit closer along the inside turning for home, vied past the furlong marker, outkicked by the top two late. A
THOUSAND REASONS broke alertly, soon sprinted clear, showed the way into and through the turn toward but not on the rail, continued to hold a narrow
advantage a furlong out then gave ground grudgingly int he late going. FINAL FORM chased the leader to that one's outside, kept the pressure on through
the turn and into the stretch, vied past the furlong marker, drifted out late carrying the runner up out, weakened in the late going. FULL OF GRACE off a step
slow, never menaced.

Footnotes
BEACH FLOWER fell back to trail soon after the start, continued to lag the middle half toward the inside, steered out exiting the final turn, closed with a rush
to kick down the leader late. VAULT in mid pack early, advanced to challenge three wide late in the final turn, took over and shook well clear by midstretch,
caved in late when unable to contain the winner, just lasted for the place. BLESSED AGAIN behind the leaders while saving ground, steered out for the
drive, getting to the runner up late while unable to match the winner. LUNA FORTIS bothered at the start, four wide when with the main body through the
first turn, continued outside to be four wide again in the second bend, came up empty for the drive to finish up evenly. GOODBYE EARL lacked early foot
while toward the inside, two path into the far turn, got out to be six wide into the lane, improved a bit while not a serious threat. JENNEMILY vied early,
dueled through the first turn and up the backstretch through some quick early fractions, faltered in the drive. MUCHO AMOR away in good order, alternated
up front through those quick early fractions and also gave way when the real running began entering the stretch. PIECE OF MY HEART in mid pack early
three wide, began a steady fade after a half.

GOOSE ALMIGHTY away well, dueled up the backstretch closest to the inside, vied into the lane while continuing to save ground, headed with a furlong
remaining, battled back in game fashion to regain the advantage late. JAMES'S MOONSHINE back off the pace while racing outside, four wide through the
turn, came five wide into the lane to lose ground to the two leaders, set down, finished willilngly to be up for the place while getting to the winner late. IMA
BLING CAT off a step slow then steadied while rank, moved up steadily to lodge an early challenge four wide early in the turn, narrowly showed the way
past the furlong marker, drifted in then faltered late to be outkicked by the top two at the wire. DATA STORM broke alertly, dueled up front outside the
winner into the turn, vied between rivals exiting the bend, fell back off the first flight nearing the furlong marker then finished up evenly. SERBIAN SAILOR
back off the pace after breaking with the field, three wide through the turn, lacked the needed closing response to also finish up evenlly. PAPA STAR within
striking distance early, three wide while behind the first flight turn, came up empty for the drive as well. RIANTE SKY off a step slow, raced well back,
improved position while not a serious threat well off the inside. WARNING LABEL lacked a closing rally while racing toward the inside. ROLLING FORK
broke a step slow, moved up to the mid pack, tired in the drive. ONE WAY STREET off a step slow, was always outrun while four wide. NO CUSSING
finished early, well back. DIXIE'S HERO raced three wide, well beaten.
