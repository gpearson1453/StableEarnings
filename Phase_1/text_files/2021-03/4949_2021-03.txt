BEBOP BABY stalked the pace while three wide then rallied on the turn, was in a long drive and drew away in late stretch. EATON'S BOOGIE was
unhurried early then rallied along the inside in upper stretch, moved out to be two wide in late stretch and was up for place in the end. JAIME'S LIL FEAR
was allowed to settled then rallied four wide in the stretch, was gaining ground but was outfinished for the place. TWIRLING AROUND was very hard to load
then set the early pace while being pressured, was inside on the turn and faltered in the drive. MY GOLDEN BLING pressed the early while two wide, was
hard used then gave way.
