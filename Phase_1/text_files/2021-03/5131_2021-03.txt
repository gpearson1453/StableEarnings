Footnotes
CHERRY ROCK BRIDGE tracked off the first flight along the inside, shifted out racing through the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch while
advancing to challenge and took over late under steady pressure. SIP'N DIP tracked off the first flight between foes, was urged to bid three wide between
foes nearing upper stretch, led between calls late but proved only second best. YES IT'S FREE settled inside foes in the last flight, saved ground on the turn
advancing to contention, was caught in tight quarters nearest the rail racing past the sixteenth marker but continued with interest to edge a rival for a share.
GONE DREAMING, urged inside a rival disputing the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, dueled for command on the turn to midstretch
and yielded in late stages. THATS ALL SHEWROTE tracked off the first flight three wide, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch while between foes
and gave way. GOLDA BISCUIT angled inwards to prompt the pacesetter racing into the turn and gave way entering the lane. INDY FRONT settled outside
foes in the last flight early and failed to menace. KOZY VILLAGE, shuffled out of tight quarters at the start, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
STOPIT, urged to the lead along the inside in the opening stages, was urged to repel several challengers racing into the turn, regained a clear advantage
nearing upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm handling. WICKED STRONG ALEX broke inwards bumping BOX CANDY, angled to the inside
tracking off the first flight racing into the turn and made the most of an inside trip to prove best of the others. NICE OF ME off slowly, then shuffled out of
close quarters at the break, quickly recovered to track off the first flight between foes on the backstretch, angled inwards conceding some position on the
turn, but continued with interest inside foes to gain position to the end. BOX CANDY, bumped at the start while shifting inwards, dropped out last racing to
the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and displayed some late interest to improve his position. DISCO'S BRIDGE angled inwards while being urged
between foes prompting the pacesetter into the turn but gave way nearing midstretch. BAHAMIAN PARK, caught five wide in the opening stages, angled
inwards approaching the turn to track off the first flight between rivals but lacked the needed closing bid. ZAMAN settled between foes in the last flight and
proved no threat. IMPERIAL GUARD tracked off the first flight racing four wide to the turn and gave way nearing the lane. LIL BULL, urged along three wide
prompting the leaders through the backstretch into the turn, was through after a half.

Footnotes
BY MY OWN angled inwards to gain terms prompting a rival's pace racing into the turn, took over nearing upper stretch and made the balance of the pace
on a clear margin while being kept to pressure. BEND THE KNEE was rated off the second flight outside foes in the opening stages, advanced four wide on
the turn to upper stretch and proved best of the others. AKSARBEN SUMMER tracked off the second flight along the inside, shifted out nearing upper
stretch to advance five wide between foes and continued with interest to prevail for a share. MEANASASNAKE exchanged bumps at the start, angled to the
inside tracking off the first flight racing into the turn and continued evenly late. STARSHIP PRANKSTER settled outside foes racing through the backstretch,
swung out six wide nearing upper stretch and continued well with a belated response to improve position. ENOUGH KISSES exchanged bumps at the start,
was righted to track off the first flight between foes in early stages, shifted four wide nearing upper stretch and finished evenly late. FLASHY FRANNIE
veered out at the start, bumping SASSY MELLY, was urged to the lead near the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the turn and gave out
entering upper stretch. CRYSTAL SKY, bumped by SASSY MELLIE at the start, was urged in pursuit of the leaders three wide into the turn and faded into
upper stretch. BETTER BOAT broke inwards bumping PRINCESS LACIE, was settled well back in early stages and failed to menace. PRINCESS LACIE,
bumped, then shuffled back at the start, angled out eight wide entering the lane but had no rally. BROOKSIDE BELLE, held up avoiding tight quarters at the
start, failed to menace thereafter. SASSY MELLY, forced out at the start by FLASHY FRANNIE into the path of CRYSTAL SKY, was quickly righted to track
off the first flight three wide between foes but soon gave way.

Footnotes
OH STEVE moved to gain a forward placing stalking just off the first flight along the rail racing to the turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch,
shifted out to split foes three deep entering the lane, then went clear late in a ridden out effort. RILEYS DUDE angled inwards to force the pace outside a
rival racing into the turn, ducked inwards once losing the advantage racing into upper stretch crossing the path of IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK, but continued
with interest to prevail narrowly for the place honors. LORD EDDARD STARK broke outwards bumping MORE THAN HAPPY soundly at the start, was
taken up, then angled to the inside while being prompted to gain some position nearing the turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch and continued willingly
to just miss for second. MCRAGS tracked off the second flight outside a rival and continued evenly between foes to late stages. KARNAK tracked off the
first flight outside the eventual winner racing to the turn, was urged to advance three deep nearing the lane, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and
gave way. IMTAKINITTOTHEBANK angled inwards while being urged inside a rival disputing the pace, was forced in by RILEY'S DUDE entering upper
stretch and quickly came up empty. MORE THAN HAPPY, bumped soundly at the start, was off last and never gained contention. EL MAYOR tracked off
the second flight along the inside and steadily faded nearing the lane. DARLA'S BIG BOY, in hand momentarily avoiding traffic at the start, settled outside
foes and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
INDY LYON, urged to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, held sway past midstretch and just
maintained the advantage to the end under firm handling. OFFICIATING tracked just off the pacesetter inside rivals in the opening half, was eased back
entering the far turn while switching outside foes, was prompted to advance three deep between foes entering the lane and continued willingly in that path to
challenge the winner nearing the wire to just miss. CHESS'S DREAM, held up between foes just off the second flight racing into the first turn, was taken up
with an abrupt move entering that bend while shifting out four deep racing to the backstretch, continued to make steady progress outside foes racing into the
far turn to advance on the pacesetter nearing the lane, shifted about under pressure while caught in close quarters late but couldn't match terms with the top
pair. HOT BLOODED tracked just off the pacesetter between rivals in second flight racing to the far turn, faded nearing upper stretch, then produced a
second effort in the closing stages to regain some position between rivals nearing the wire. LIGHT US UP switched out three wide in the opening stages
tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, was prompted to lodge a brief bid entering the far turn but faded in the drive. OSPREY, caught a bit wide
into the first turn while momentarily losing her path, continued four wide to upper stretch but lacked the needed closing bid. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE
RIDER OF CHESS'S DREAM LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST OFFICIATING ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM
WAS DISALLOWED.

FATE OF OPHELIA tracked off the second flight three deep racing to the first turn, continued outside a rival through the backstretch, was prompted to
advance three deep nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage leaving the furlong marker and held IN ITALIAN (GB) to the end under firm handling. The
latter angled inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, switched off the inside nearing upper stretch, switched out sharply avoiding close
quarters entering the lane and continued willingly to the end to close the gap. EMIRATES AFFAIR, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace, pressed the
issue racing through the far turn to gain a brief advantage between foes nearing the lane but yielded to the top pair late. JEAN V'S LEGACY settled in the
last flight along the inside racing to the far turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch and made some belated progress. EARNESTINE N HAZEL (IRE)
tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, switched out leaving the far turn but had no rally. TAKE JOY settled outside foes in the last
flight racing to the backstretch, was fanned seven wide into upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. NABRUZZI settled between foes racing to the backstretch
and offered no rally. TONALISA, pulled her way clear along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, dueled
inside foes, then gave out racing into upper stretch. BALLET SCHOOL tracked off the second flight between foes to the far turn and faded into upper
stretch. SWEET MARY LOU angled to the inside stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, steadied sharply
nearing the quarter mile marker and faded while being gathered up in the lane. MYONGA proved no factor. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE QUARTER MILE MARKER BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

FOREMAN, in touch with the pacesetter three wide between foes leaving the chute attending that rival's pace, pressed the issue through the turn, couldn't
match terms with the pacesetter entering upper stretch but produced a solid closing response under firm left handed pressure to wear down that rival in time
to prevail. WILLY BOI broke sharply to gain the advantage, shifted inwards leaving the chute to dictate the pace between foes on a narrow advantage racing
a bit off the rail racing into the bend, shook clear in upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum through the final sixteenth. SHOO SHINE was
switched out of close quarters in the opening stages, then was prompted to advance three wide between foes racing into the turn, continued in that path to
upper stretch but couldn't close the gap on the top pair late. AWESOME PUDDING angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn,
saved ground through the bend and faded in the drive. GATSBY, held up off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out four wide racing
into upper stretch and steadily faded. TWO STEPPIN KLUKI, off slowly, raced last to the turn and proved no factor. BREEZE ON BY tracked just off the
pacesetter between foes racing to the turn but was through after a half. PIRATE PARADE was a brief factor racing four wide as part of the second flight in
the opening stages but steadily faded racing into the turn.

ME AND MR. C, reserved outside a rival behind the second flight racing to the first turn, shifted out four wide midway through the backstretch was prompted
to make a steady advance in that path racing into upper stretch and produced a solid closing response to just edge SHAMROCKET in the final stages under
firm handling. The latter, reserved near the inside behind the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out to race between foes, lost some position
nearing the far turn continuing under patient handling, was prompted to split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch to bid inside the pacesetter
leaving the furlong marker but was just outkicked. OVER THE CHANNEL tracked the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight, saved ground to
upper stretch and continued well enough to edge a rival for a share. J P HELLISH broke readily, dictated the pace on a clear margin racing a bit off the rail
to the far turn, held sway into upper stretch but yielded late. SECOND MATE angled inwards to gain a position just off the pacesetter attending that rival's
tempo, was urged to advance on that foe nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. WINTER'S WONDER was rated between foes as part of the
second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted three deep between foes into the far turn but gave way nearing the lane.

TAP IT TO WIN, bumped by R MERCEDES BOY in the opening stages, was rated between rivals racing just behind the first flight in the opening quarter,
angled to the rail on the turn briefly awaiting an opening, came through to challenge in upper stretch, wrested the advantage under firm right handed
pressure and was taken in hand approaching the wire once the issue had been decided. R MERCEDES BOY shifted out sharply in the opening stages,
making contact with HAUNTEDBYTHEMUSIC, then bumping the eventual winner, was urged inside rivals to dictate the pace on a narrow advantage racing
into the turn, dueled for command while shifting off the inside racing into upper stretch and proved no match for the winner while prevailing for the place
honors. HAUNTEDBYTHEMUSIC, bumped in the opening stages, switched outside foes early to track off the first flight, was prompted to advance four wide
nearing upper stretch and continued in that path to gain a share. CAJUN BROTHER angled inwards while being urged to press the pace between foes
through the backstretch into the turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. MY BOY LENNY, in touch with the leaders three wide, was urged to press the
issue in that path racing into the turn to upper stretch but gave way leaving the furlong marker. OLD TIME REVIVAL bobbled at the start while breaking
awkwardly, was righted to track off the first flight between foes but faded early.

Footnotes
SUMMERING advanced to a contending position while under rating to stalk just outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, continued under light
reserve to the second bend, steadily advanced to press the issue into upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage midstretch, then skirmished to the wire to
narrowly prevail under left handed pressure and firm handling. CLASSY WOMAN, pulled her way to the lead along the inside leaving the chute, dictated the
pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch to the far turn, dueled for command inside the winner past midstretch and resisted that foe grudgingly to
the end to just miss. LOVELY LUVY angled to the inside while tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground in that position to upper
stretch, then shifted out four wide in the closing stages to gain position between foes while prevailing narrowly for a share. SUN SUMMERS tracked the
leaders outside rivals as part of the second flight and continued evenly three wide between foes to the closing stages. BEAUTIFUL LOVER, caught in close
quarters in the last flight racing to the first turn, was settled last on the backstretch, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch and made some belated
progress. BIENVILLE STREET tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but weakened late. CROWN AND SUGAR,
forwardly placed in the opening stages to track just off the leaders between foes racing to the backstretch, continued in second flight to upper stretch and
faded late. SUGAR FIX was rated off the second flight between foes in the opening half, shifted out four wide in upper stretch while being prompted to
advance but had no rally. HERE COMES JACKIE switched outside foes in the last flight racing four wide to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter.

R ADIOS JERSEY broke outwards bumping a rival, was quickly righted while being urged to a clear advantage angling inwards racing through the
backstretch, set the pace just off the rail racing into the turn, was prompted to go clear and held sway through the stretch under some right handed pressure.
PSYCHIC ABILITY was rated off the second flight between foes racing through the backstretch, split rivals just off the inside racing into upper stretch and
proved best of the others. RAY AREWETHEREYET, bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight racing five wide between foes into the turn, advanced
to contention four wide in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. SPECIAL PRINCESS settled between foes in the last flight racing to the turn,
swung out six wide in upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. PRINCESS SECRET tracked the pacesetter four wide in second flight,
made some brief progress in that path on the turn but had no closing bid. FAN FAN switched off the inside early while being prompted between foes to gain
a a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, was urged to lodge a brief bid midway through the turn but came up
empty entering the lane. SKY PROPOSAL, urged to a forward placing while angling to the rail in the opening stages, tracked the pacesetter inside foes to
the turn and faded into upper stretch. GO JO JO GO was off slowly and failed to menace thereafter. EAST WING settled outside foes racing four wide to the
turn and proved no threat. QUINOA TIFAH vied briefly three wide between foes in second flight pursuing the pacesetter but gave way racing into the turn.
ADIOS TRIPPI tracked off the second flight racing six wide into the turn and soon retreated.

Footnotes
WAITING FOR A STAR was rated off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, advanced three wide through the far turn to challenge racing into
upper stretch, wrested the advantage and drove clear. CLASSICAL MAGIC sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the
far turn, resisted the winner's bid but proved only second best. LAKE PARIMA tracked the pacesetter outside a rival as part of the second flight, was urged
to advance between foes into the lane and continued willingly to prevail for a share. LUCY'S TOWN settled last while angling inside, saved ground into the
far turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch to split rivals three deep in the closing stages but continued with interest to gain position to the end. PIONEEROF
NEW YORK tracked just off the pacesetter inside a rival racing to the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch, was prompted to advance in tight quarters
nearest the rail but came up empty in the closing stages. MAGIC HATTER tracked off the second flight outside, was prompted to advance while being
fanned five wide into the lane but lacked a closing bid while bumped late. OVER TO YOU tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch,
shifted out to advance four wide between foes entering the lane but lacked a rally while bumping a rival and the loss of her rider's whip. ELUSIVE RYDER
settled into stride off the inside and offered no rally. TANAGER angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight but faded after a half. SWEET
STORY settled outside foes racing to the first turn and dropped out early.
