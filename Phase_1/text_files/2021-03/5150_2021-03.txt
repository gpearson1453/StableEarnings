TONKA FLOWER rushed to the front inside, widened on the turn and remained safe while kept to a drive. FEDERAL CASE pursued the winner inside and
continued gamely but was no match. ACED lagged far behind down the backstretch, split foes in the stretch rallying. LUCKY HERO broke sluggishly,
chased inside and flattened out in the stretch. KINGSVILLE lacked speed outside, moved wider in the stretch and was no factor. D T GOODIE raced wide
and gave way readily after half a mile. JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF prompted the winner for half a mile and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
ENIGMATICA dueled two wide for the early lead, took over on the clubhouse turn, showed the way into the far turn, responded when roused, dug in
determinedly in deep stretch and held on. OCEANO ROSSO dueled on the rail for the early lead, took back on the clubhouse turn, then stalked, chased on
the far turn, drifted out at the quarter pole, rallied outside in the stretch and dug in gamely to the finish. HOLA PRINCESS raced off the pace inside, chased
the leaders on the far turn and rallied mildly for third. MINI SCOOP trailed the field, moved up three wide on the far turn and flattened out. BETTER YET
raced off the rail, off the pace, chased the leaders on the far turn and tired. I'M NOT JOKING tracked inside, lacked a response and gave way. QUIET
PLEASE raced three wide early, then two wide off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
TRUE BOLDNESS settled off the leaders, angled out in the stretch and rallied clear while kept to his task. LUVINMEISEASY broke sluggishly and raced far
back, moved wide in the stretch rallying too late. NINETYEIGHTOCTANE dropped back outside, bore out on the turn then closed well very wide. GRAVES
ISLAND set the pace, moved inside near the far turn, led to the stretch and faltered. STRONG BREEZE prompted the leader inside to mid stretch and
weakened. WON THE CASE saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally. FIVE MORE MINUTES prompted the leader outside then proved empty in the
stretch. ASPHALT PAVING raced far behind and gave way readily.
