JACK BE FAST pressed early, rallied, on the far turn and gained the lead, remaained clear late under strong handling. OBSESSIONSOPTIMIST raced
close up throughout, could not gain late on the winner but held place. GRAD BASH was never far back, rallied in the stretch three wide and closed willingly.
GOLDEN AFLEET pressed the pace on the inside, was squeezed at the 3/8 pole and was no factor after that. OUR PETITION settled early, lacked a late
response. REALITY'S ROAD set the early pace, gave way on the far turn and was eased to the wire and walked off. The stewards posted the inquiry sign
but took no action.

MIGHTY ANGEL was well placed on the inside, angled out three wide on the turn, drew off in the stretch under a hand ride to win as much the best. SILVER
CONNECTION pressed early, rallied on the turn and gained the lead, was no match for the winner in the stretch but was second best. BLOWBACK vied for
the lead and weakened in the stretch. CARMEL BAY was allowed to settle early and was no menace. A PENN LEGACY was no factor. RUBY Y'ALL dueled
early and gave way on the turn. HURRICANE NATION was outrun.
