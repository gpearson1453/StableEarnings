Footnotes
PS BETTIN ON YOU led two wide on the backstretch, cleared inside rival on the turn, shook well clear from rivals on the turn and kept to task in the stretch
to win clear. NUTTY SIERRA stalked leaders along the inside on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn and made his bid along the rail in
the stretch, kept on well and got up for second at the wire. MELCHIOR chased leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered
stretch in range of clear leader, drifted in final sixteenth and lost second at the wire. HOSS CARTWRIGHT came out two lanes at the start, pressed for lead
along the inside on the backstretch, tried to hold rail into the turn but backed out of spot early on the turn and steadied, re-bid on the turn and outkicked in
deep stretch in between rivals. TIME N MONEY bothered by inside rival at the break, lost much ground and had to settled at the back of the pack off the rail,
entered turn off the rail, mildly urged in the lane to pass one rival. JUPITER S. stalked leaders off the pace two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two
wide and failed to launch a rally in the stretch.
