MOR BREEZE quickly made the lead from the rail, was nicely rated on the front end, repulsed a bid in mid stretch and drew off under firm handling. IT'S
ALL CASH pressed the winner on the inside, rallied in mid stretch and drew close, could not match strides late but was second best. THE NEW MIAMI
chased the winner throughout and went evenly late. SYMPHONY HALL never far back early, swung four wide in the stretch and lacked a late response.
CANDY FOR ALL was no factor. ANTHONY'S GIRL was outrun.

Footnotes
FROSTED WHITE FACE pressed early, rallied in the stretch, drew off, late driving. HURRY ON OUT was unhurried early, rallied in the stretch, split horses
and was up for place. ARMADA dueled early, drew clear on the turn, was hooked in mid stretch and held well late. COMPLY never far back, had a mild bid
on the inside. COMMANDER CHACHI contended throughout and went evenly late. SOUTHERN WILL well placed, lacked a late response. CLEVERLY
WICKED was no factor. LANDON'S MIRACLE was outrun. AWESOME OX wide early, was outrun. ONLY ONE WAY BACK had brief early foot, dropped
back on the turn and was eased in the stretch and walked off.
