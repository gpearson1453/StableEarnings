CLASSY BEAST was never far back, ranged up to take over outside MISS OVER THERE and JUST SMOK'N just after going three furlongs, kicked clear at
the top of the stretch and widened under mild pressure. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE bumped with MISS OVER THERE at the start, raced two wide around the
turn, and finished willingly on the rail. MYSTIC COMIN HOME saved ground into the turn, angled to the far outside at the head of the stretch, and offered a
mild response to pick up the show. MISS OVER THERE vied up front inside JUST SMOK'N before getting outsprinted to the turn, rebid between horses
near the five-sixteenths, but faded through the drive. TOO STYLISH bumped with JUST SMOK'N at the start, raced three wide and failed to menace. JUST
SMOK'N bumped with TOO STYLISH at the start, moved to a clear lead heading to the turn, yielded to challengers after three furlongs and tired.

Footnotes
BEASTER became fractious prior to the start breaking open the stall door and dislodging the rider, broke a step slowly and was outrun early, swung four to
five wide rallying off the turn, collared the leaders from outside entering the final furlong and drew off. PALADIO bobbled slightly at the start, advanced while
shifting out four wide after a half-mile, reached a short lead in mid stretch, then proved no match for the winner. AL HEYBAY pressed the early pace three
wide, poked a head in front between rivals turning for home, weakened near the eighth-pole, bumped late with DROP ANCHOR and saved the show. DROP
ANCHOR broke slowly and was outrun for a half, tried to get through on the fence in deep stretch, lacked sufficient clearance and steadied while bumping
with AL HEYBAY near the finish. THINKABOUTIT contested the early pace between AWESOME BEACH and AL HEYBAY, and dropped out of it midway on
the turn. AWESOME BEACH hustled through on the rail to set a pressured pace inside rivals, and faltered through upper stretch.

speed, raced five wide and went evenly. BONNO failed to menace while racing three wide. DAMIR was outrun inside. R GUITAR CASINO made little impact
while racing two wide. TORQUE played no factor while racing three wide. TRINNI VALANTINE had brief speed three wide.

GRAINGER COUNTY vied outside FRENCH REEF from the outset, stayed on task through the drive and proved best near the finish. FRENCH REEF (IRE)
hustled through inside after the start, battled inside GRAINGER COUNTY throughout and yielded grudgingly. MR NAPPY raced two wide to the stretch,
lacked the needed closing response and was able to salvage the show. COLD WARRIOR saved ground to the stretch, moved out near the eighth-pole and
finished evenly. FRONTIER MESA raced forwardly inside for three furlongs, and faded through the stretch. THE SPIDER was outrun inside. BALABAN was
outrun two to three wide.

PRETENDANT stalked the pace two wide, lost position while urged around the far turn, tipped further out in upper stretch, re-rallied outside and was up in
deep stretch. BUFFALO MAX was bumped at the start, saved ground off the early pace, moved three wide around the far turn, took the lead nearing the
quarter pole, vied outside of SPINNING KITTEN through the lane, narrowly won that duel but could not withstand the winner late. SPINNING KITTEN set a
rated pace inside, was headed nearing the lane, fought back inside to lead through most of the stretch and just missed. CONVICT PIKE was bumped at the
start, saved ground off the pace, made good progress in upper stretch but was blocked through the final sixteenth. FREEDOM'S FLIGHT was in range
inside and lacked a rally. MY GOOD MAN played no factor while saving ground early and racing three wide around the far turn. BREAK BEAT raced two
wide and was through early.

Footnotes
BAHAMIAN GIRL took control after the start, rated along near the inside to the stretch, and responded to pressure to remain clear. ETANA was slow into
stride and outrun for a half-mile inside, moved out in the stretch and found her best stride late to get up for second outside rivals. ASSUME CONTROL
saved ground forwardly placed to the stretch, could not reach the winner under strong urging through the furlong grounds, and was outfinished for second.
GRACE'S DRAMA raced three to four wide around the turn, advanced through upper stretch, then flattened out. SHE TAKES HEART prompted the pace
outside BAHAMIAN GIRL for six furlongs, and faded in the stretch. INTEREST was no factor four to five wide. DONT GET SMART was slow from the gate,
raced two to three wide, and was finished early. FLASHING DIAMOND tracked outside the leaders three wide to the turn, and gave way nearing the stretch.

Footnotes
STORMY DERBY DAY was unhurried in the second flight for six furlongs, swung four wide turning for home, finished determinedly and was up outside
FREDDYMO FACTOR in the final strides. FREDDYMO FACTOR took control after the start, rated along through manageable early fractions, fended off bids
from TRISH THE DISH and SETTING THE MOOD passing the quarter-pole, went clear again through the furlong grounds, but could not withstand the top
one. SETTING THE MOOD advanced outside through the middle stages, lodged a bid four then three wide around the far turn, could not sustain the rally by
mid stretch but stayed on well enough for the show. TRISH THE DISH moved up three then two wide to challenge between FREDDYMO FACTOR and
SETTING THE MOOD after six furlongs, but weakened late. SHE FLED THE SCENE saved ground early, shifted out four wide at the top of the stretch, and
did not have enough to threaten. PEARLESCENT prompted the pace to the far turn, and lacked a solid closing response. SMIRKOTCH was never
prominent. EIGHTY SEVEN NORTH was forwardly placed three then two wide for six furlongs, and tired.
