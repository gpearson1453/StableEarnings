Footnotes
GRAY SKY MESA stalked three wide, vied outside of DESTINY'S LOVE into the turn, drew off from that foe turning for home, and widened under driving
pressure. HEY ROXY vied along the inside, took back to stalk into the turn, tipped two wide turning for home to achieve place in upper stretch while proving
no match for the leader, then just held that position from an inner rallying rival. DELETERIOUS lagged well behind the pace early on, the improved along the
inside through the lane, but just missed catching HEY ROXY for place on the wire. RAILROAD ROSIE failed to factor. ROCKING SHOES chased two to
three wide around the turn, and faded. DESTINY'S LOVE led two wide early on, the inside of the eventual winner into the turn, but was headed by that foe
at the three furlong pole, weakened turning for home, and stopped through the lane. Due to a timer malfunction internal fractions are unavailable.

FLAT OUT LARCENY stalked along the inside, swept past the trio of leaders four wide turning for home, and drew off in upper stretch. TAYLOR'S VISION
prompted the duel three wide, but had little resistance for FLAT OUT LARCENY at the quarter pole, then kept on while battling for place outside of SARAHS
HOME, and drew clear from that foe in the final sixteenth to secure that position. SARAHS HOME dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but proved no
match for FLAT OUT LARCENY at the quarter pole, dug in inside of TAYLOR'S VISION to duel for place, but was bested by that foe at the sixteenth
marker. RIVER RUBY was off poorly, lied far off of the pace five wide around the turn, and failed to factor. NOTHIN BUT CLASS dueled for the lead two
wide and between horses, but weakened passing the quarter pole. ON A SHOESTRING was off poorly, and outrun. FRACTIONS ARE UNAVAILABLE.

TERRIS STRONG HOPE dueled for the lead outside of MISS CASEY BETH, forged an advantage from that foe at the five sixteenths grounds, battled on
after being re-headed by her inner dueling counterpart in upper stretch, forged an advantage inside the final sixteenth, and drove clear late. MISS CASEY
BETH dueled for the lead inside of TERRIS STRONG HOPE, got headed by that foe at the five sixteenths marker, but gamely regained an advantage in
upper stretch, clung to that margin inside the final sixteenth as she and her rival tired, but yielded to that foe approaching the wire. LILLY BELLE saved
ground far off of of the pace, shifted outside of the dueling leaders in upper stretch, then stayed on to cut the gap as those foes tired through the final
furlong. FLAT QUICK failed to factor. TWIN SISTERS was done early.

Footnotes
TAYLA chased the leading pair three wide, bid for the lead turning for home, drove clear passing the three sixteenths pole, and safely held from
JUSTABOUTRIGHT. JUSTABOUTRIGHT tracked from midpack four wide, ranged up outside of TAYLA turning for home as that foe bid, sustained chasing
position through the lane after that foe cleared, then failed to have enough to catch her late. SEEING DOUBLE saved ground far off of the pace, shifted
three wide approaching the furlong grounds, and improved position to just catch MAUI JANE for show. MAUI JANE tracked from midpack along the inside,
rallied inside of foes turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, then flattened out, and was nailed on the wire for show.
BROOKLYN BABY dueled for the lead along the inside of VIVA LA SECRETA, drifted outwards after clearing that rival while TAYLA produced a bid at the
quarter pole, then weakened in upper stretch. VIVA LA SECRETA failed to factor. LUCIA GAL was outrun. BERYL'S FLIGHT dueled for the lead two wide
into the turn, but faded at the three furlong pole, and weakened through the lane. BLING SPRINGSTEEN was never involved.

BOX SEAT tracked from midpack, made a three wide bid for the lead into the far turn, dueled outside of ROCKPORT KAT through upper stretch, then
prevailed over that foe in the late stages. ROCKPORT KAT set the pace along the inside, loped clear into the backstretch, dug in inside of a pair of foes into
the far turn, dueled inside of BOX SEAT in upper stretch, but was bested by that foe. CHOCOLATEICECREAM lied off of the pace along the inside, then
two to three wide around the far turn before improving position while failing to threaten the top pair. SHINING SOURCE lied far off of the pace two to four
wide around the turns, and failed to factor. NEWPORT BEACH stalked two wide, bid for the lead between horses when BOX SEAT forced his hand into the
turn, but failed to keep pace with those rivals at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened turning for home. BIG MONEY MACHINE was outrun.

Footnotes
SUNDAY'S VISION stalked the leading duelers three wide, inched closer around the turn, to bid for the lead turning for home, quickly drew off passing the
three sixteenths marker, opened up, and was geared down through the late stages. APPLE COUNTY trailed the field in the five path around the turn, shifted
to the six path turning for home, rallied outside of tiring foes, and reached place late. WIREWIREWIRE lied off of the pace four wide, altered outside of
PRINCESS ASYA in upper stretch after being guided inside of that rival entering the lane, then stayed on late inside of APPLE COUNTY, but was
outfinished for place. PRINCESS ASYA vied two wide, led briefly inside of SUNDAY'S VISION turning for home, but proved no match for that foe in upper
stretch, and weakened through the late stages. HIGH CLASS EURO saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. BREW CASA set the pace along the
inside, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
OKIE FRONT prompted the pace three wide, forged an advantage turning for home, spurted clear of inner rivals in upper stretch, widened after switching to
her right lead at the furlong grounds, and was geared down through the final sixteenth. MARIA ELENA Y. G dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals
around the turn, proved no match for OKIE FRONT entering the lane, shifted outwards in upper stretch, and held place to the wire. TWILIGHT CURFEW
lied off of the pace in the two to three path around the turn, then improved by splitting foes for a minor reward in midstretch. MISS TYRO chased along the
inside, but failed to produce a bid. AFLEET OKIE failed to factor. JENSEN GRACE chased four wide around the turn, and tired through the lane. BILLIE G
was never involved. SIGICRICKET dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but proved no match while weakening entering the lane. TELL ME
BOO BOO was outrun along the inside. MAGIC MINDY was bumped at the start and last away, trailed throughout, distanced in upper stretch, eased up
approaching the wire, then was unsaddled at the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
MAN U stalked three wide, bid for the lead turning for home, drove clear while shifting outwards in upper stretch, and held sway through the lane.
DROWNINGNDIAMONDS tracked from midpack four wide, rallied through the lane with MAN U to catch, but was only second best. FETCHUM KETCHUM
dueled for the lead two wide, held a brief lead turning for home, then gave way in upper stretch. IRISH CAPITAL dueled for the lead along the inside, but
weakened at the five sixteenths pole. ON THE BRIDGE was never involved. EUROBADGUY was no factor. CHUKKA lied far off of the pace four wide
around the turn, and failed to factor. STARWARD chased along the inside early on, but steadily faded around the turn. DALMAVSMAN were outrun.
