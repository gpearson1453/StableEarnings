JANET'S MAE tracked the early pace, loomed five wide through the turn, hooked up with WALTZING ATTILA out of the turn, took control at the eighth pole
and drew off as an easy winner. WALTZING ATTILA set a pressured pace, went four wide into the turn, met the bid of the winner, couldn't sustain the pace,
was no match late and finished second best. TUTTA TERLINGUA was allowed to settle early, raced between rivals into the turn, angled out six wide out of
the turn and was along for third. ZAMARA was void of speed, circled seven wide through the turn, passed foes and offered no rally. NORWEGIAN pressed
the early pace, went three wide into the turn, drifted out and faded. STEVE'S BABE DOLL stalked the early pace, raced off the rail and flattened out.

Footnotes
ADDISON BOOM was void of any early speed, raced along the inside into the home turn, angled out through the turn, made a bid on HONOR STRIKE,
dueled briefly with that rival, and edged clear for the win. HONOR STRIKE set a pressured early pace, raced three wide into the turns, opened up through
the second turn, met the bid of the winner, couldn't sustain the run and finished second best. OCULUS was allowed to settle early, raced six wide through
the second turn, drifted out late, finished evenly and was along for third. MCENTIRE was unhurried early, circled eight wide through the second turn and
offered no late rally. SQUARED STRAIGHT pressed the early pace, went five wide into the second turn and weakened. ALL CHROME tracked the early
pace, went six wide into the second turn and was empty late. LASTEN IMPRESSION was taken back early, saved ground and was no factor. LODESTONE
raced in mid pack early, raced off the rail and faded.

ASSETS INCLUDED pressed the early pace, raced four wide into the second turn, met the bid of CATS TOUCH through the second turn, dueled to late
stretch, shook that rival and held for the win. CHECK AND RAISE was void of any early speed, angled out nine wide into the stretch, was gaining late and
finished second best. CATS TOUCH tracked the early pace, went five wide into the turn, made a bid on the winner, dueled to late stretch and weakened in
the final strides. KONA SKYE was unhurried early, angled out eight wide into the stretch, was closing late and needed more ground. GOLD TREASURE
was reserved early, raced six wide into the second turn and offered no late rally. REMEMBERTOBREATHE was allowed to settle early, raced between
rivals into the home turn and was empty late. CAROLINA ISLAND was outrun early, raced five wide into the second turn and never fired. IRON BRITCHES
was sent hard to set a pressured early pace, raced three wide through both turns and faded.

Footnotes
HEAVY FAVOR set a three wide pressured pace, opened up through the turn and held for the win. UNION BROTHER tracked the early pace, raced six
wide into the turn, drifted out late and finished second best. REDACTION was unhurried early, raced seven wide through turn, angled in, was gaining late
and was up for third. JUST AWESOME M was taken back early, advanced eight through the turn and was closing late. TENGA'S GOLD was allowed to
settle early from off the rail and faded. DAVE'S GIFT was outrun early from the inside and offered mild late rally. ETERNAL KINGDOM was up close early,
raced five wide and gave way. RUNNING FOR GUS was void of speed, went six wide and never fired. OLD GUARD raced in mid pack, went seven wide
into the turn and retreated. PARTY WITH DADDY pressed the early pace and stopped. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
