Footnotes
SCAT FOR THE CAUSE forwardly placed while outside, three wide through the turn, extended stretch duel, wore down rival late. SUPER STEAMY pressed
the issue early from inside the winner and between rivals, dueled with that same foe the length of the stretch, gave ground grudgingly. WHATS UP
SWEETS off slowly to trail in the early going, remained back while in the two path into the turn, split foes when straightened for home, rallied for the show
while not a threat to the top two. WILDWOOD FLASH stumbled at the start, raced back and outside, four wide through the turn, improved a bit while not a
serious factor.l. I'M STYLIN void of speed while saving ground, continued along the inside, improved up the rail to improve. KOWGIRL KIRBY one paced
along the inside, continued evenly through the stretch. CAROLS KITTEN broke sharp, set the early pace along the inside, faltered when headed by the top
two turning for home. LADY LUTE in mid pack and outside, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
PRINCE LEO in the main body while racing outside in the run up the backstretch, four out to five wide through the turn, staged a willingly rally out in the strip
to be up in time. ROLLING FORK with the pace from the start off the inside, vied through the turn, continued to duel past the furlong marker closest to the
inside, led late, could not contain the winner while closest to the inside of the first flight. DATA STORM forwardly placed while outside, three wide through
the turn, challenged approaching the furlong grounds, dueled, late, weakened from between the top two in the late going. REDIVIVUS void of early foot
while outside, came five wide into the lane, improved position with some modest late interest. MY LITTLE TIPSY bumped soundly at the start, settled off the
pace and the inside, went flat through the stretch in lacking a serious kick. PRIVATE TRUTH lugged in, soundly bumping MY LITTLE TIPSY, raced well
back in trailing, four wide into the lane, showed some belated interest. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY void of speed, raced outside, improved slightly without posing a
serious threat. SHARP WILLY in the second flight while racing four wide, tired in the drive. GONNA GETCHA one paced in mid pack, continued to race
evenly in lacking a closing response. ONLY ICON dueled up front closest to the inside for a half, gave way. LA' HOPPER fractious in the gate, reloaded,
broke with the field, stopped before a half, trailed home.

Footnotes
SHARECROPPER close from the start, moved to the inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to show the way second turn, shook clear
through the lane under token encouragement to win ridden out. BULLION in the second flight while saving ground, continued inside through the second
bend, rallied up the inside to gain the nod for the place. UNCLE GREGORY settled off the pace off the inside, could do little with the winner in chasing that
one through the lane, nipped for the place. CARTE BLANCHE broke back, evenly paced just off the inside early, moved out, raced four wide through the
second turn, lacked a closing punch. DOWN HOME KITTEN was never dangerous while racing off the inside. ROAR OF THE LION off a step slow, trailed
most of the way in showing little. R V T THUNDER ROAD pressed the winner from the outside for six furlongs then gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
TAPALIST void of speed, four wide when making a commanding move toward the front, took over, quickly clear drew out under steady handling.
CONQUISTADOR SHOW dropped inside to save some ground in the first turn, continued inside, traffic through the second bend, angled out for room three
wide into the lane, proved no match for the winner, held sway for the place. MAJOR KONG broke back, lacked speed out in the strip, came five then six
wide out of the final turn, rallied for the show to be clear for that position, not enough for the place. ASTROLOGER pressed the issue while off the inside,
continued to force the issue second turn, weakened in the drive. GEORGIA DEPUTY settled in mid pack while off the inside early, steered out to be five
wide through the final bend, improved position slightly while not a serious threat. SHE LOVE ME pinched back at the start, dropped inside, behind horses
while saving ground through the far turn, asked along late n the final bend, went evenly through the stretch. COPLEY broke out to bother SHE LOVE ME,
was straightened to set pace just off the inside, dueled far turn, faltered drive. SHAKE IT void of speed, raced four wide through both turns, failed to rally.
STASH THE CASH fell back to trail after the start, saved ground through the final turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided.
TOUGH COMPANY four wide into the first turn when within striking distance, began a steady retreat three wide after a half. RIVER FINN five wide when
forwardly placed into the first turn, also gave way after four furlongs, trailed home.

Footnotes
MIGHTY MISCHIEF broke alertly, cleared early, showed the way through the turn, widened into the lane, not threatened to the wire under steady handling.
LONG TERM THINKING back off the pace toward the inside, four to five wide into the lane when floated out turning for home, rallied to be clear for the
place, no match for the winner. HANEY BOYS in the second flight while between horses in the two path, pressed turn, no match top two in the drive, clea4r
of the others. KING OF THE NITE broke into the gap to race back early, in some traffic late in the turn, improved somewhat when clear, no real threat. TIME
IS YOURS off a step slow, raced back, in some traffic while three wide turning for home, improved slightly, also did not pose a serious threat. ATOKA in the
second flight outside, crept closer in the three path midway on the turn, saw that momentum stall while appearing to get out late in the turn, continued to
weaken through the stretch. RESERVE in the second group along the inside, gave way in the drive. TANGO CHARLIE was finished early.

Footnotes
CANDY CORNELL broke in good order, cleared toward the inside before a quarter, shrugged off a couple of foes turning for home, edged clear again inside
the furlong grounds, keep to task. FROLIC MORE lacked speed toward the inside early, came three wide out of the turn, rallied willingly to be up for the
place in the final strides. CYRIL'S BOY forwardly placed between rivals early and in hand, moved closer to try the winner from the outside turning for home,
proved no match for that one through the lane, nipped for the place at the end while gaining the nod for the show. MO'S MOJO settled off the pace and the
outside, four wide into the turn, in good position in the three path turning for home, lacked the necessary response while between rivals at the wire.
CRYPTO CASH void of speed, raced in the two path through the turn, displayed a modest amount of late interest out in the strip. ENERGIZER prompted the
leader along the inside for a half, had little left for the drive. LULLABY BLING lacked speed, swung five wide exiting the turn, came up empty for the drive.
EUROCHIPPYGOLFER broke awkwardly and remained back.

Footnotes
ROBINSON settled off the pace inside, patiently handled into far turn, tipped out into the two path turning for home, closed with good resolve to be just up in
the final strides. MY BOY GUS broke on top, set a quick set of semi contested fractions, shook well clear into the lane, continued to hold daylight until late,
nipped in the final strides. VASARIANO within striking distance, three wide into the lane, set down for the drive, was going willingly to close the gap. WILD
UNION broke in, steadied to race be last to leave, continued back, came four wide into the lane, improved position while too late. DRAW THE LINE raced in
mid pack just off the inside, in some traffic turning for home, clear for the drive, finished up evenly to be flat in the late going. PERFECT SENSE broke in to
bother PAYNTER PARTY, was straightened to lack speed while three wide through the first turn, dropped inside to save ground through the second turn,
one paced to the wire. PAYNTER PARTY in tight at the start, settled in the main group off the inside, in some traffic in the second turn, lacked a response in
the drive. FIRST RATE in the second flight while four wide into the first turn, three wide through the second bend, weakened in the drive. QUARTERBACK
DAK remained always back. JACKS FIRE BALLS was always outrun while racing four wide. DON VITO CORLEONE chased the runner up for six furlongs,
stopped badly, trailed home, jogged in.

Footnotes
CARIBBEAN (AUS) broke on top, controlled all the pace toward the inside, drove well clear under steady pressure through the lane. DEFENDER pressed
the winner off the inside and in hand, asked along second turn, could not keep up in the drive, fully extended to preserve the place. BACKGROUND allowed
to settle off the pace and the inside, set down when three wide into the stretch, closed the gap late on the runner up while narrowly prevailing for the show.
STRONG TIDE three wide and off the pace through the first turn, continued outside, three out to four wide turning into the stretch, chased the runner up past
the furlong marker, flattened out late to be caught for the show. BEAVER HAT off the early pace and the inside, steadied repeatedly in traffic through the
first turn, continued back, in some additional traffic early in the far turn, got through in the two path, improved position slightly. ALL WEST settled off the
pace along the inside, had nothing for the stretch run. WARRIOR'S MAP four wide into the first turn, within striking distance for a half and then began to tire
soon after.

Footnotes
GOODNIGHT ARCHIE broke alertly, came out to bother BELLAMAYS ROAN early, was straightened to duel through the turn off the inside, continued to vie
into the lane, lugged in under a right handed stick a furlong out brushing with the runner up, came in again late, narrowly gained the nod at the wire. NAVY
SEAL with the pace closest to the inside, dueled through the turn and into the stretch, brushed by the winner past the furlong marker, again by that rival late,
narrowly missed. IMA BLING CAT bumped just after the start, raced in the second flight inside, steered out three wide into the lane, proved no match for the
top two late, remained well clear of the others. J'S LITTLE MAN in the second flight while racing outside, four wide through the turn, went evenly through the
stretch in lacking a closing response. ZOMBIE LOBO came out soon after the start to bother a couple of outer rivals, was straightened to race inside, altered
course around some traffic turning for home, finished up evenly. FUNNY ACTOR soundly exchanged bumps with STORM CLASSIC when tightened up just
after the start, raced in the second flight in the two path, in some traffic midway on the turn, came up empty for the drive. DOVER LIGHTS void of speed,
moved out to race three wide late in the turn, failed to make an impact through the lane. BELLAMYS ROAN bothered, pushed out by the winner a furlong in,
began a steady fade before a half while three wide. CATS GOTTA CHANCE off slowly, never menaced. STORM CLASSIC bumped soundly after the start,
remained always back. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF BELLAMYS ROAN AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED
