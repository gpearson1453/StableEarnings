Footnotes
TEKILA assumed a prominent position after bobbling at the start, vied for command from path two to the five-sixteenths marker, matched up with the
ground-saving ALPHA BABE, had no sooner put away the aforementioned rival when confronted by BRAVO REGINA, got set down spinning into the lane,
inched her way out to the outer border of her path, was in the process of doing so when solid contact was made with BRAVO REGINA twice, with that one
being worked closer to the inside at the time, between the eighth pole and the sixteenth marker, dug in with good determination to be the first to cross the
finish line. BRAVO REGINA tucked into the two path after the field had been sent on its way, drafted behind TEKILA for a good portion of the journey
leading up to the five-sixteenths pole, tipped into the three path at that station and went on to challenge in earnest a few jumps later, shied slightly to the
outside, reacting to the leader moving a bit to the outside herself, was being guided afterwards towards the rail as the one to catch was coming out roughly
to the same extent, saw the twosome bumped solidly with the each other two times, had the pilot drop the whip, ventured onward but was unable to muster
a serious bid thereafter. FIRING CAROL taken hold at intervals while appearing keen on the chute, departed the backstretch in the three path, went about
the turn hand urged, got switched over to stronger handling in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths marker, went into the stretch and made no headway. DARE
TO PROMISE unhurried two wide for nearly six furlongs, got sent out four wide from upper to midlane, lacked the necessary response. BARN QUEEN
underwent a ground-saving journey, came into the lane under a drive, failed to fire. ALPHA BABE along the inside, argued for control until the
five-sixteenths marker, faltered. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the stretch run, in addition to a claim of foul lodged by the rider of BRAVO
REGINA against the rider of TEKILA, the latter was disqualified from first and placed second for causing interference.

Footnotes
SISTER ALEXA four then three wide in pursuit from rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command nearing the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive kept to task. MOSIENKO chased four then three wide coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole before being set down three wide into upper stretch, took over command at the three-sixteenths, got collared nearing the eighth pole, proved no
match for the top one while running on well clear of the rest for the place honors. MONGOLIAN HUMOR three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at
the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and improved position to secure the show honors. WICKED TITLE four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the rail half a mile from home, got coaxed along midway on the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. BLITCHTON
LADY forwardly placed from the gate, advanced to take command six and a half furlongs from home and showed the way just off the inside while in hand,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front at the three-sixteenths and weakened. PERSIAN
QUEEN hustled from the gate, showed the way early on three paths off the inside until displaced by the aforementioned foe six and a half furlongs from
home, chased three then two wide, faded through the latter portion of the turn and swung three wide into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish.

Footnotes
OK HONEY away without apparent mishap, got guided into the three path, crept up to the front runners late on the bend, got set down in the general area of
the three-sixteenths marker, bested the nemesis during the ensuing furlong then edged clear, kept to encouragement to the end. MADERA brushed at the
break, vied for command two to three wide, shook free after the half had been rattled off, got turned loose spinning into the lane, faced off with the winner a
sixteenth later, yielded, battled onward until approximately a sixteenth remaining, stayed on well for second. PENDOLINO rode the rail until the quarter pole,
angled five wide into the stretch, made no headway en route to finishing on even terms with another for the show. GRINGOTTS took up the chase two wide
on the turn, got sent out into path six from upper to midstretch, was making any headway while dead heating for third. STUNNING MUNNINGS brushed
from both sides in the shadow of the starting gate, was never more than two wide for the first six furlongs, failed to menace. TUFF BIRD hustled out of the
gate to procure a forward position after making light contact with another, contended for the top from just off the rail for three-quarters before faltering.

Footnotes
IRISH GIANT bumped at the start by LIQUOR, who broke outwards and then bumped with MED SCHOOL MICHAEL, who got bumped from the outside by
NINETY NINE GEORGE, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a
challenge through the final furlong taking command a sixteenth from home, then inched away to the finish. LORENZEN four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and ran on to secure the place
honors. SIMBASALLTROUBLE forwardly placed from the start, was eased off reluctant to lead and settled three to four wide in pursuit from just off the
pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, bid six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive heads apart for command a furlong out, then got
outkicked to the finish. LIQUOR broke out at the start bumping IRISH GIANT, led early on under a firm hold reluctant on the lead, got displaced by MED
SCHOOL MICHAEL with six and a half furlongs to go and chased just off the inside in closest aim, came under coaxing near the quarter pole when taking
narrow command, swung three to four wide for home, dug in under threat and relented near the sixteenth marker, then weakened in the late stages.
TALESPIN four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. NINETY
NINE GEORGE broke in at the start bumping MED SCHOOL MICHAEL in concert with IRISH GIANT, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home, made no late headway. MED SCHOOL MICHAEL bumped between foes at the start, advanced after the break to
take command with six and a half furlongs remaining while three paths off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths under threat, succumbed nearing the quarter pole, went just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
HIM SHE KISSES cut over to the rail with the advantage shortly after the start, showed the way, forced to fend off a pair of opponents to the outside for
most of the trip leading up to the end of the bend, got called upon for more in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker, went at it one on with VICTORY
BUILT from the eighth pole onward, gamely got the job done. VICTORY BUILT off a half length the fastest, stayed forwardly placed, disputed the pace from
between rivals for over a half, was coming up to the three-sixteenths marker when let loose, fought to the outside of the top one during the final furlong, got
denied. JIMMY THE KID spotted just off the inside route, sat within range of three-way contested pace, was cued up tipped into the two path for entrance
into the lane, altered into a freshly-vacated three path in midlane, failed to cut into the deficit. GIANT SHOES made no impact while undergoing a
ground-saving journey. FARRAGUT came inward after losing his tooting springing from the starting gate, attained a forward position, vied from path three as
the outermost of a trio until head of the stretch, was put to a drive for the drive, shifted one path falling of the pace contest in the furlong grounds, steadily
backed away. BEAVER CREEK sighted along the rail on the turn, was moved out two wide for the drive, lacked the necessary response. LITTERBOX
checked getting squeezed at the start, took the inside route, angled into path five from upper to midlane, never made its presence felt. APEX PREDATOR
nudged towards the rail by FARRAGUT at the start, pursued the pace from the two path on the turn, swung out four wide entering the lane, came up empty.

BETSY BLUE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied through the final furlong to
get up in the final jumps and prevail. SHAKER SHACK brushed the near side stall at the start under hustling, chased just off the inside in aim of the leader,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, rallied to issue a challenge taking command nearing the sixteenth pole, got
caught in the last jumps to the finish. SHESADIRTYDANCER established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, took
the inside route into upper stretch and got roused straightened away for home, dug in under a drive getting collared near the sixteenth pole, then kept on to
preserve the show honors. TAP THE BARREL broke out at the start and was corrected, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued
three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. OVERDRESSED chased four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five to six
wide into upper stretch and offered no response. BUSTINMYGROOVE chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and weakened. DRAMATIC TWIST three paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE cut over to the rail of the turn, inched up as the half was being completed, got cued up angling three wide at the three-sixteenths
marker, began to close the gap, struck the front end with a few jumps to spare before the finish line. SHE'S A BLACK BELT prompted the pace from path
two, settled onto the head of the stretch and was called upon, out-battled DIAL ME UP to start the final furlong narrowly leading, saw the winner begin to
close in, relinquished reluctantly a short distance from the end. DIAL ME UP established the top, got guided onto the inside route at the half mile, showed
the way, with SHE'S A BLACK BELT in accompaniment from the outside, had a spirted tussle between them got sparked off at the top of the lane, appeared
to get headed as the twosome finished off their run through the furlong grounds, fought onward to earn the show award. RISK MODEL took up the chase
from the three path, fanned out six wide from upper to midstretch, continued down the center of the strip pretty much as the widest of all, narrowed in en
route for the last major check. GLASS CEILING off approximately a length the tardiest, raced in the two path for the initial half, was steered out five wide
once in the stretch, rallied mildly. FREEDOM PASSAGE saved ground for a half and faltered. ELEGANT ZIP brought the back of the pack, was down along
the fence on the bend, was moved out four wide entering the stretch, had no offering.

through the stretch to get up in the last jumps and prevail. DUTCHMEN FOREVER chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung
five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in under late threat and was caught in the final jumps to the finish. PAYNT THE
EDGES inside briefly, tipped out to chase three then two wide advancing on the leader with a pair to take command three furlongs out between foes, came
under coaxing through the latter portion of the turn, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive and was headed a furlong from home, weakened
in the late stages while along clear for the show honors. WHATS IN IT FOR ME broke out at the start, chased four then three wide advancing on the leader
at the three-eighths put to coaxing, challenged through the latter portion of the turn and spun three wide into upper stretch, then weakened through the
stretch. FLIPPING FUN five then four wide in pursuit, advanced with and outside a pair to challenge the leader placed to coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. PATTY O'MARC lunged at the start getting away last, chased along the inside under a ride
from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. CHIEF ASHAROKEN broke in at the start, chased six paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and tired.
CAPE COD GEM established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under challenge from a trio
and was overwhelmed at the three-eighths put to coaxing and yielded command, swung three to four wide into upper stretch in retreat and folded.
