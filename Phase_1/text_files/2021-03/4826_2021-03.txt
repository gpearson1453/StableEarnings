VALIANT APPEAL showed good early speed to set the pace, drew off in late stretch and clearly was much the best. BEST LITTLE MAN chased the early
speed while inside and saving ground on the turn, made a bid in the stretch and was second best in the end. ROLL ON CURLIN chased the early pace
while two wide into the turn, made a bid but came up empty in late stretch. SAMURAI CAUSE was inside and saving ground on the turn then made a mild
rally but was no threat. BOURBON WISDOM chased the early pace while four wide into the turn then failed to menace in late stretch. ARDENLEE STAR
chased the early pace while three wide, was used up then faltered. REBEL RUMBLE was unhurried early and no threat. WAR VETERAN raced four wide on
the turn and flattened out in the drive. MORO APPEAL was no factor.
