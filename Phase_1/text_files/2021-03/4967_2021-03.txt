Footnotes
GASPERGOU pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled with MY CALL down the lane and was just up. MY CALL raced within contention,
moved up on the outside around the final turn, dueled down the stretch and just missed. UNBRIDLED PULPIT lacked early speed, raced wide around the
final turn, made a bid and proved no match for the top two. TAP A MIRACLE raced in the back of the pack, showed late interest, but was no factor.
WILDFIRE STORM raced in the middle of the field, made a bid and hung. THIRSTY WIND dueled for the early lead, saved ground and faded. ST MARIA
void of early speed and showed little. IN COMING J flashed brief speed and dropped to the back. Due to a timer malfunction the opening quarter time is
unavailable.
