Footnotes
THAT'S A SONG tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up to make a bid in the four path on the turn, drifted in while taking the lead in upper stretch,
responded well in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. BROOKLYN BABY was hustled to the lead, set the pace on the inside while under
some pressure, lost the lead to the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished while able to hold the place. CUSTOM CUT bumped with a rival at the start,
settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, pursued the leaders under a drive into the final furlong and lacked
the needed kick while just able to get the show. LIL' SISTER LOU broke in and bumped with a foe, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on
the turn, moved out behind the leaders in upper stretch and was out-kicked then just missed the show. SUPERSPORT SALLY settled on the outside, went
three wide on the turn, steadied in traffic in upper stretch then altered course to the outside and lacked the needed response. GOODNIGHT GRACIE jostled
with a stumbling foe at the start, angled in while well placed just off the pace, went three then four wide while in dead aim of the leaders on the turn, was
roused five wide into the stretch but also lacked the needed response. RHETT'S RACER bumped with rivals on both sides at the start then was squeezed
back, checked sharply midway down the backstretch, came under urging before the half-mile pole, rounded the turn in the two path, angled out while put to
a drive in upper stretch and failed to rally. TUFFOLOGY stumbled very badly at the start and unseated the rider then was caught by the outrider in the
stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
SPECTROLITE broke very fast and was clear immediately, controlled the action while inside to the two path through the turn, responded well when asked
for his best in upper stretch, remained clear but with the margin diminishing into the final sixteenth, drifted out late and held under strong urging. MORE
ABUNDANCE was well placed just off the pace, bumped with a rival leaving the backstretch and dropped back, went around the turn in the two path, was
roused for his best into upper stretch, rallied into the final furlong and closed strongly but was too late while clear for the place. JUST BLAZE settled on the
outside, was roused four wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and finished willingly for the show. FREEDOM FACTOR reared at the start and
was last to commence, settled towards the back, moved closer late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch
and improved position to just miss the show. FIREWATER JAKE was well spotted just off the pace, bumped with a rival leaving the backstretch, saved
ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, drifted out in pursuit of the winner inside the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response.
LOOPALLU was rated off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path, was put to a drive in upper stretch and also
lacked the needed response. CORRUZE settled under some urging while traveling awkwardly, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. HOTFOOT
settled off the pace, dropped to the rear late on the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and was no factor.
JAKE THE BAND MAN tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the turn and tired. (Rail at 16 Feet)

BLONDIE LOX BABE broke out a bit at the start, showed good speed on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, drifted out under pressure in
upper stretch, drifted out more while dueling into the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed under strong urging. MALARTACH settled at the rear, raced inside
to the two path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, moved out outside the eighth-pole, rallied in the final furlong and closed strongly to just miss
while able to get the place. D'WILD BARONESS showed good speed on the outside and disputed the pace, vied in the three path on the turn, took a short
lead at the quarter-pole, dueled with the winner while being carried out in the stretch, fought on to the wire but missed and lost the place. BAR TAP settled
off the pace, moved in near the half-mile pole, went three wide on the turn, angled out outside the furlong marker and finished willingly. CRY LIKE A BABY
was well placed just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, chased into upper stretch, drifted in outside the furlong marker and lacked the
needed kick. ELLA'S LIL STAR pressed then chased the pace on the outside, raced in the four path on the turn then the five path into the stretch, dropped

wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CARAMEL ANGEL settled comfortably on the inside, was asked in the two path into the stretch, moved out behind the leading duo inside the
three-sixteenths, rallied outside into the final furlong, drew alongside the leaders coming to the sixteenth-pole then glided by while placed under a confident
hand ride to prevail. JURISDICTION went to the front then moved clear, rounded the first turn in the two path, was well rated while setting a tepid pace, saw
the lead diminish with a half-mile to run, vied inside on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive while under attack in upper
stretch, dueled with KINETIC SWAGGER into the final furlong, brushed with that foe outside the sixteenth-pole, fought on to the wire but missed while
narrowly able to get the place. KINETIC SWAGGER went three wide on the first turn, followed the solo leader from second, moved closer with a half-mile to
run, rounded the far turn in the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole, drew alongside the runner-up in upper stretch, dueled into the final furlong, brushed
with the aforementioned foe outside the sixteenth-pole, fought on to the wire but missed and was denied the place but clear for the show. CURLINGTON
raced under a tight hold in the two path on the first turn, was reserved under stout restraint, moved closer with a half-mile to run then dropped back leaving
the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the two path while still in reserve, was roused at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch and
improved position. COPPER FIDDLE went three wide on the first turn, was rated under a tight hold, dragged his way forward near the half-mile pole then
was placed under even stronger restraint, went three wide while let out some on the far turn, was asked four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
kick. BRIAR JUMPER settled on the inside towards the rear, saved ground under reserve on the far turn, was roused in the two path at the quarter-pole and
finished willingly. TAPAGE went three wide on the first turn, was rated on the inside of a rival, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was asked four wide on
the far turn then driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ARPINELLA went four wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside,
moved closer near the half-mile pole, went five wide on the far turn, was roused six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. (Rail at 16 Feet)

Footnotes
DISCREET TIGER bumped with a rival at the start, moved in while showing good speed, vied inside to the two path on the turn, responded well when asked
outside the three-sixteenths then came under a right-handed crop, switched to a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker and held under strong urging.
DECLINED settled off the pace, was taken in hand near the half-mile pole while moving closer, went two then three wide on the turn, was put to a drive
while four into upper stretch, pursued the winner determinedly into the final sixteenth, gained on that foe late but missed while able to get the place.
POPULIST bumped with a foe at the start, was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside to the two path on the turn, was asked once straightened for the
drive, pursued the winner into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. SHIPPINGPORT broke out at the start, settled off the
pace, went three then four wide on the turn, moved out while asked for his best in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. BUCKY stood in the gate
and was off slow, spotted the front many lengths, settled on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. RED HOT DEVIL stalked
the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole and came up empty. CAN IMAGINE dropped back early then
was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and was no factor.

Footnotes
MR. AL'S GAL settled off the pace, went around the turn in the three path, came five wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed well to get the lead
outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under good handling. OUR LOST LOVE showed good speed and set the pace, vied in the two path on the turn,
was asked the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while able to get the
place. SNOWBALL broke a bit slow, settled at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole, moved out near the furlong
marker, shifted further out while gaining approaching the sixteenth-pole and finished fast to just miss the place while narrowly up for the show. NUN OF
OURS tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into stretch under the
drop, pursued the leader into the final furlong and was outfinished then lost the trifecta. FAME FEATHER settled on the inside of a foe, went around the turn
in the three path, was roused four wide into the stretch and finished willingly. SARAH'S PASSION was hustled from the start then taken in hand early,
established a good position just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under the crop and lacked the needed
kick. FORT POLK settled on the outside, was asked while moving closer in the four path on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. CRESCENTCITYPRETTY broke out and hit the gate, settled off the pace, dropped back some while getting extra left-rein guidance leaving the
backstretch, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, was roused three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. (Rail at 16 Feet)

hold, vied in the three path on the far turn, was asked while on even terms for the lead into upper stretch, dueled on the outside of the runner-up, came in a
touch seventy yards from the wire and prevailed under steady handling. SINCERITY went to the front, set the pace on the inside, was urged along on the far
turn, dueled inside of the winner under a drive in the stretch, swapped back to her inside lead into seventy yards from the wire and missed while well clear
for the place. BREEZIN BYE YOU broke out at the start, was hard held in the two path while reserved at the rear, remained under a tight hold on the far

two path, checked late on that bend then dropped back, was rated off the pace, went two then three wide on the far turn, was given her cue at the
five-sixteenths and came up empty. THEBOYZGALAXY sat back just before the start and was off a couple of lengths slow, went five wide on the first turn,
