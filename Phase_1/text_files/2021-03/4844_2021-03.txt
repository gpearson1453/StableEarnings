Footnotes
FLAMINGO HAWK stalked the pace three wide, seized command near the quarter pole and drew off under steady left-handed urging. DR. ROGER tracked
the pace from the inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and gained second. BOTTOM DECK set the pace in
the two path, was no match for the winner from the quarter pole, continued on the left lead through the stretch and held third. DIVERT raced off the pace
four wide, angled down to the two path nearing the five-sixteenths pole and lacked the needed rally. JUGUETE failed to menace while racing three wide.
KOLOHE PRINCE never threatened while racing four wide. OVERSTATED was outrun while racing two wide. DAMIR saved ground off the pace, ducked
out leaving the eighth pole and never threatened. MILITARY COMMANDER had some speed two wide, stopped and was easing through the lane. LORD
THEO was through early and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
PASSION PLUS was outrun early, angled off the inside shouldering LOVE DADDY out of the way and into INTEREST at the top of the stretch, rallied to
overhaul SOMETHING MAGICAL from outside in deep stretch and drove clear. SOMETHING MAGICAL got outrun to the top by DIXIE PRINCESS nearing
the first turn and steadied awkwardly under a firm hold, moved out to press the pace, wrested command after six furlongs and kicked clear, but could not
withstand the top one late. AERODYNAMIC saved ground to the far turn, shifted to the two-path into the stretch and finished one-paced inside NYMUE'S
TREASURE to snag the show. NYMUE'S TREASURE raced three wide, edged closer after six furlongs, but lacked a solid final response. LOVE DADDY
angled to the rail after breaking behind the field, took the far turn two then three wide, got knocked into INTEREST by PASSION PLUS at the top of the
stretch, and kept on evenly. INTEREST ran along near the tail of the field three wide for six furlongs, got bumped and pushed out several paths by LOVE
DADDY turning for home, and dropped back. DIXIE PRINCESS set the pace inside, was collared approaching the stretch and folded up. THERE WAS A
STEWARDS INQUIRY FOCUSING ON THE INCIDENT AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

CAUSINGAHULLBALOO settled off the pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch, battled outside of
SYSTEMATIC through most of the stretch and held firm. SYSTEMATIC tracked the pace from the rail, got through inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch
and finished gamely inside of the winner. KATIESDREAMGIRL saved ground off the pace, went two wide around most of the far turn, swung five wide near
the quarter pole and had a mild rally to gain the show. EMIRATES AFFAIR set the pace just off the rail and weakened in the lane. TIZOFADEAL failed to
menace while racing two wide. BELLE'S KINGDOM pressed the pace three wide and tired in the drive. MANUELA stalked the pace three wide and came up
empty in the lane.

Footnotes
ROCKING THE BOAT tracked from close range inside for a half-mile, switched out three wide at the top of the stretch, responded well and wore down the
leaders from outside through the last eighth of a mile. TOWN CLASSIC ranged up three wide to join the front flight outside the quarter-pole, took a short
lead from COVE BLUE through the furlong grounds, but could not match strides with the winner a sixteenth out. COVE BLUE sprinted clear early, felt
pressure from TOWN CLASSIC turning for home, yielded in mid stretch but kept on to clearly best the remainder. ALL AROUND moved inside up the
backstretch while outrun, stayed on the rail through the drive and improved enough for the last major share. LIKE YOU was outsprinted early, shifted out
four wide leaving the turn, and made no headway. BENEFACTOR stayed in range two to three wide for a half, and faded through the stretch. BOJINGLE
saved ground early, moved out three wide and tired after a half.

OFFICIATING tracked the pace two wide, split rivals in upper stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and edged ahead under a drive. FLIGHT TO
PARADISE settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, bid outside nearing the eighth pole but was outkicked.
BORKAN hit the starting gate, raced off the pace three wide and rallied for the show. TRIPLE JEOPARDY raced off the pace three and four wide and had a
mild rally. MAGICAL ADVENTURE was strung out four wide around the first turn, went two wide rounding the far turn, stayed on through the lane but was
no threat. SKYWALKING saved ground off the pace, went four wide around the far turn, swung widest in upper stretch and was one-paced through the
stretch. THE RED MAN was up close four wide around the first turn, moved up to duel three wide down the backstretch and around the far turn, angled in in
upper stretch and tired in the final furlong. DUNKLE failed to menace while racing inside. GOLDEN TONE pressed the pace two wide, dueled between foes
rounding the far turn, remained up close to midstretch, was shut off nearing the eighth pole and lacked room from there. NACHO SUPREME set the pace
along the rail and retreated in the lane. COACH PAUL saved ground in midpack and lacked room through the stretch. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED
WITH FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

CREATE A STORY pressed the pace outside MYSTIC COMIN HOME and QUEEN ABARRIO, took over in upper stretch and widened under pressure.
BEAUTIFUL ROSIE dropped back entering the turn, continued along at the back three then four wide, began picking it up on the far outside through the
furlong grounds and was along for the place. QUEEN ABARRIO vied for command between horses for better than a half-mile, and weakened through the
final furlong. JOST DREAMY shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, and gained only mildly. BEASAICHI broke behind the field, moved inside up the
backstretch, went back out three wide at the top of the lane, and made no impact. MYSTIC COMIN HOME dueled inside QUEEN ABARRIO and CREATE A
STORY to the stretch, and weakened approaching the eighth-pole. LA GATA NEGRA moved out four then five wide while retreating after a half. WICKED
SPIRIT raced close up early, gradually moved out four to five wide around the turn, and had nothing left into the stretch.

Footnotes
SERENADE A KITTEN stalked the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn, closed steadily through the lane and was up in
deep stretch. CRYSTAL COAST set the pace along the inside, widened nearing the lane, continued on the left lead through the stretch and led until the final
strides. PRETTY RACHEL had her head turned at the start, raced off the pace two wide, angled three wide nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left
lead in the lane and rallied mildly outside. CELESTIAL CHEETAH saved ground well off the pace and had a mild belated gain inside. APPOINTED was
fractious in the gate, tracked the early pace two wide and faded around the far turn. VIKING QUEEN steadied along inside around the first turn, continued to
save ground well back rounding the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and lacked a bid. CHEERLEADER BARB was off a step slow, saved ground in
range, made some progress three wide around the far turn, bore out nearing the quarter pole, dropped well back and was no further factor.

Footnotes
GATSBY eyed the dueling leaders taking closer order around the turn three wide, challenged outside SPEARGUN once straightened away into the stretch,
and prevailed after a stiff drive. SPEARGUN went head and head for the lead inside TIMEWON'TLETMEGO, got the best of that dispute at the top of the
lane while being taken on by GATSBY, shifted off the rail battling shoulder to shoulder inside the latter, and yielded grudgingly. SIR OLLIE tracked the duel
just inside GATSBY into the turn, shifted out four wide after that one went by near the quarter-pole, and ran on to clearly best the remainder. SHOO SHINE
raced four to five wide around the turn, and could not reach contention. TIMEWON'TLETMEGO dueled outside SPEARGUN for just over a half-mile, and
gave way turning for home. AMPERSAND veered out sharply at the break, got steered to the rail up the backstretch, steadied attempting to get through
inside SIR OLLIE past the half-mile pole, and dropped back.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN RON saved ground waiting behind the dueling leaders near the quarter-pole, moved out three wide for clearance into the stretch, stayed on his
left lead challenging outside FULLY LOADED through the last eighth of a mile, and prevailed after a hard drive. FULLY LOADED dueled outside FAIR
CATCH from the outset, battled between that one and CAPTAIN RON into deep stretch and just missed. TROPICAT raced three wide in the second flight to
the stretch, rallied between horses late and finished gamely. BELGRANO was a bit slow to find his footing at the break, swung four wide at the back leaving
the turn, and was gaining widest of all to the wire. FAIR CATCH contested the pace inside FULLY LOADED from the start, stayed on to deep stretch and
yielded near the finish. HERO TIGER saved ground outsprinted to the stretch, moved to the two-path gaining mildly through the furlong grounds, then
lacked a clear path behind the leaders the last 70 yards or so. STATION ROCK had an inside trip, and could not make headway through the drive.
MALRAUX raced close up three wide to the stretch, and weakened.
