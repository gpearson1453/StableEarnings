Footnotes
MIAHSOLOMIAH vied early between horses, moved inside being hounded by MUDSLIDE WICKED entering the turn, dug in along the rail and prevailed
over that rival after a long drive. MUDSLIDE WICKED pressed MIAHSOLOMIAH from outside throughout, could not get past through the lane, but held well
to be clearly second best. COMPETENT settled in the middle of the field three wide to the quarter-pole, advanced turning for home, drifted out slightly in
deep stretch and saved the show. SASSY CAT saved ground outsprinted early, moved out for the drive, got floated out a bit while rallying through deep
stretch, and just missed third between horses. EMPEROR'S SONG bumped the left side of the gate at the break, raced three to four wide while far back to
the end of the turn, and improved on the far outside without threatening. BLESSING MEMORIES hustled up early inside, could not keep up with the leaders
approaching the turn, and had no closing response. KAYLA'S TUNE was no factor inside. OUR WEST INDY pursued the leaders for three furlongs, and
tired. DRAWNTOMUNNY was outrun three to four wide. TALEGA DINERO contested the early pace, got shuffled back and steadied approaching the turn,
and retreated steadily. AN OBJECTION AGAINST COMPETENT BY THE RIDER OF SASSY CAT ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS
DISMISSED.

LOAD UP MOE raced off the pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, seized command leaving the eighth pole, drew off under a drive then
widened under minimal urging through the final sixteenth. PARMENIDES saved ground well back, rallied inside through the lane and was up for the place
late. WESTERLY WIND prompted the pace four wide, reached near even terms nearing the quarter pole but flattened out in the lane. ULTIMATE GIFT set
the pace in the two path, led past the eighth pole then tired. COUCH DREAMS stalked the pace three wide between foes and came up empty in the lane.
LISA'S FIRST LOVE had brief speed two wide. JIMBO was outrun in the two path.

CAIRO CAMPAIGN tracked outside UNPRECEDENTED and BIG MAN BOB early, took over midway up the backstretch and moved inside, felt pressure
from several rivals around the far turn, dueled inside POSITIVE PHIL into the stretch, drifted out exchanging brushes and bumps with the latter and held firm
to the finish. POSITIVE PHIL saved ground early in the second flight, followed after CAIRO CAMPAIGN from outside heading into the far turn, brushed and
bumped with that foe through the last eighth of a mile and could not get by. BIG MAN BOB vied outside UNPRECEDENTED around the first turn, yielded to
CAIRO CAMPAIGN and POSITIVE PHIL after a half-mile, stayed in pursuit inside through the far turn, and could not gain late on the fence. KING
OTTOKAR trailed early inside, moved menacingly four wide around the far turn, but could not sustain the rally. ANOTHER SOFTBALL raced two to three
wide around the turns, and could not threaten. PAWNBROKER advanced with a three-wide challenge between horses approaching the stretch, but flattened
out into the lane. PRETENDANT was finished early two wide. UNPRECEDENTED vied early inside, stopped after a half-mile and dropped far back, was
pulled up in the stretch and walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN FOCUSING ON THE FIRST TWO FINISHERS
BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
VEGAS WEEKEND had early speed between rivals, settled back nearing the turn, re-bid three wide around the bend, took over near the five-sixteenths pole
and drew off under mild urging. JAMSSTAR was in range three wide, could not keep pace with the winner but stayed on to gain the place late. PLATINUM
FROLIC vied inside of foes to upper stretch and weakened. THE JOKES ON ME failed to menace while racing four wide. NUSCAA vied three wide down
the backstretch, two wide in to the turn and retreated nearing the lane. OUR TEN ANGELS played no factor while racing four wide. POISON IVY was outrun
inside. FLAINE broke a bit awkwardly, raced four wide and was never involved.

Footnotes
CANDY FLOWER prompted the pace outside MY LIPS ARE SEALED, dialed up the pressure around the far turn, took over through the furlong grounds and
drove clear. WICKED MERCURY saved ground in easy striking range for six furlongs, moved off the rail turning for home, finished well but could not
seriously menace the winner. CAMELLIA GAL was never far back, raced behind the leaders while between horses around the far turn, and lacked a solid
closing response. MY LIPS ARE SEALED set the pace inside, could not hold off CANDY FLOWER in mid stretch, and weakened on the rail. DIZZY broke
slowly, saved ground on the turns and failed to make her presence felt. INDICIA alternated between the rail and the two-path on the turns, and made no
progress. SENGEKONTACKET raced three wide, and tired after six furlongs. SCATNAP was no factor in or around the two-path.

SHACKLETTE set the pace in the two path, dug in inside of ALIZEE from the quarter pole, drifted out in the final furlong and lasted. TIME TO TWO STEP
saved ground off the pace, angled out nearing the quarter pole, closed outside and just missed. ALIZEE stalked the pace three wide, reached near even
terms approaching the quarter pole, vied outside of the winner from there and hung late. PERSPIRE failed to menace while racing three wide. VICTORY
CRUSADE lagged inside early, advanced four wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. BIRD MAP had early speed two wide
but was through early.

Footnotes
KATAMA MOONLIGHT set a sharp pace inside, shook clear around the far turn, widened through the stretch under a drive, and was geared down 70 yards
out. MINT EDITION raced two to three wide in the second flight for six furlongs, and finished willingly to be along for the place. HIGHTAILING steadied
along the rail first time under the wire, moved to the two-path near the back for six furlongs, and offered a mild late response. REGAL PASSAGE advanced
three wide after a half-mile, got shaken off by the winner approaching the stretch, and weakened. LOOK ME OVER made her way inside soon after the
start, saved ground to the stretch and faded. RECIPROCAL pressed the pace outside, could not stay with KATAMA MOONLIGHT around the far turn, and
tired. BORN MEAN was three wide early before moving inside, and showed little.

Footnotes
GAME BOY BENNY pressed the pace two wide, seized command near the quarter pole, vied to midstretch then drew off under a drive. ROUGH ENTRY set
the pace in the two path inside of the winner, battled to midstretch, could not keep pace from there but stayed on to hold the place. STAR JUANCHO saved
ground off the pace, angled out turning for home and was along for the show. VINCENT WILLIAM chased the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally.
SOLDOLLIE failed to menace while racing two and three wide and was vanned off. RAY'SWARRIOR chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the
lane. UNPUBLISHED had some speed inside and retreated in the lane. ONE TURN JOHNNY broke awkwardly and trailed well off the rail.

Footnotes
NORTH BROADWAY broke out bumping DROP A HINT, tugged her way along three wide under early restraint, shifted a bit further out getting set down
once straightened away for the drive, responded with a good late burst and was up late outside. FURIA VIKINGA (CHI) stayed in range near the inside
early, came two wide off the far turn, dove to the rail rallying inside the leaders a furlong out, reached even terms 50 yards from the wire and was edged out.
VIVIDLY (GB) settled in the second flight early, swung four wide at the top of the lane, and was going well too late on the far outside. MORAL REASONING
steadied between horses shortly after the start, advanced three wide with aim outside the leaders turning for home, and was outfinished for the show
between horses. DROP A HINT had her hind end bumped by NORTH BROADWAY at the start, vied outside SANITY early, moved inside after getting past
that one going to the turn, dueled with PILOT EPISODE to deep stretch, and was overrun from both sides. PILOT EPISODE contested the pace outside
SANITY and DROP A HINT up the backstretch, remained head and head with the latter around the far turn and into the stretch, and steadied late while
being swarmed from both flanks. STICKINGTOGETHER saved ground, and lacked the needed response. SANITY dueled inside for a half-mile, and gave
way entering the far turn. MY SASSY SARAH refused at the start, was backed out of the gate, and walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO
THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
GOING FOR GOLD sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace in the two path and widened under a drive. SURPRISE FACTOR settled off the pace
while racing two wide, finished willingly and gained the place late. ROMARIO stalked the winner from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch, lugged in leaving
the sixteenth pole and lost second late. GRAINGER COUNTY chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. CLAMOR hit the starting gate, raced off
the pace three wide and never threatened. GETTHE MUNY BERNIE was outrun inside. CRACK SHOT played no factor while racing two wide. OUR
DESTINY was in range three wide and faded in the lane. COLD WARRIOR hit the starting gate, raced four wide and made little impact.
