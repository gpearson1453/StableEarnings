throughout and lacked a finish. ZEDUSIVE showed early speed, raced close throughout and was outfinished for show. TIZ SASSY brushed at the start,
pressed the pace and finished evenly. ROARING QUINN brushed at the start, raced within contention and put forth an even effort. KIMMY brushed at the
start, raced near the back and was never a factor. TALE OF TENSAS void of early speed and was never a threat. LAWSON always raced near the back

Footnotes
MISS NITAP vied for the early lead, saved ground, took the lead around the final turn, drove clear, was all out and held on well for the win. INAWIC raced
within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a bid down the stretch and needed more ground. MIDNIGHT TRIP came out at
the break, dueled for the early lead, weakened and proved no match for the top two. NON BINDING raced within contention, had an outside trip and finished
evenly. BEAUX TOX steadied at the start, raced in the back and was never a factor. LONE STAR SECRET steadied, angled in at the start, raced near the
back and showed little.

Footnotes
FULL POWER was an early factor, took the lead around the turn, pulled away down the lane and proved much the best. JOE DIVER raced near the middle
of the pack in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a wide rally, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. FIFTY
PROTECTION vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the top two, but held on for third. SPEEDOFTHESPEED broke a
step slow, rushed up, challenged for the lead and was outfinished for show. KASEN'S KROSSING lacked early speed, came around the turn wide, showed
late interest, but was no factor. JAYS RIVERWRANGLER broke in, raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. RUN ETHAN RUN dueled
for the early lead and faded. MR. SNOWFLAKE shut off at the start, raced near the back and was never a threat. JUSTA BUSTER showed early speed and
dropped back. PRODUCTION TIME void of early speed and showed little.

GEORGIA DAWN raced within contention, moved up on the outside around the second turn and was going away at the end. SWEET MILAGROS lacked
early speed, made a steady gain, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. DIXIE LOVING raced near the back in the beginning, came
around the final turn wide, made a late gain and proved no match for the top two. EBONY BAY raced within striking distance, made a mild bid, but was no
factor. SHREW GRIT broke out, challenged for the early lead and weakened. RHETT'S RACER raced near the middle of the field, had an outside trip, made
a mild bid and faded. ENVOY'S GUILT challenged for the early lead and was finished early. CAUGHT HIS EYE dueled for the early lead, faded around the
second turn and was no threat late. SHILOH COUNTY always raced near the back and showed little.

pack, came around the first turn wide and was never a factor. OLD TIME GIRL broke out, raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort.
