COMMANDING GENERAL , urged to the early lead, hugged the rail setting a pressured pace and drew off in the drive. MORE TWIRL prompted the pace
outside the winner in a game effort. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN lacked speed, swung to the four path leaving the turn, raced outside horses and passed tired
ones. DAPER'S DRINK , reluctant to load into the starting gate, circled the turn three wide, chased the pace to the stretch then weakened. SHAKA STYLE
stalked the pace along the inner rail and faltered. COME AND GET ME was outrun.

Footnotes
TWITTY CITY stalked outside a rival then edged up to have aim on the dueling leaders past the three eighths, came three wide into the lane, rallied under a
drive to put a head in front in mid stretch, edged away slightly with about seventy yards out then was fully extended to hold off LUXERO. LUXERO settled
off the pace while in the clear, came under a solid ride into the far turn, commenced a run soon after, split rivals near the quarter pole, drifted in a bit when
chasing the embattled leaders near the sixteenth pole, altered out and finished gamely to gain. LOST MY VOWCHER was sent up three wide early,
prompted the pace outside SPANISH D'ORO, moved to apply more pressure past the five eighths, dueled into the far turn, put a head in front three furlongs
out, shook clear heading towards the lane, dug in when confronted past the three sixteenths, sparred and faded late. JACOBA broke a step slow, saved
ground and edged up past the seven eighths, had good position past the five eighths, angled out around the far turn, chased four wide nearing the lane,
failed to kick on from there and drifted in while fading. TINY TIN broke a step slow and was outrun. SPANISH D'ORO sped to the front, set the pace towards
the rail, took pressure past the three quarter pole, dueled into the far turn, kept on to the five sixteenths then gave way.

OMATI cleared soon after the break, set the pace under a light hold and towards the inside, took some pressure past the three eighths, dug in when
confronted past the three sixteenths, turned away BANANAS ON FIRE and kicked back away as his rider lost the stick inside the sixteenth marker.
BANANAS ON FIRE settled off the rail and within range, took closer order three wide past the three eighths, circled four wide under asking into the lane,
drew on even terms with a furlong remaining, was repelled and continued willingly to be second best. FULL DINNER JACKET , under snug hold early while
saving ground and stalking, came under a ride mid turn, eased out giving chase past mid stretch but came up empty. ONE MORE CHAPTER , four wide
early, settled off the pace, raced three wide into the lane, drifted in near mid stretch and had a slight response. DA CHROME settled in the clear, edged up
nearing the far turn, chased the leaders three wide past the quarter pole but lacked a stretch kick. JACK GAVE BACK lagged off the pace, came four wide
for the drive but failed to pose a threat. GOLDEN WARRIOR , a bit keen early when moving to a stalking spot, prompted the pace two wide, was under
some coaxing when lodging a mild bid after six furlongs, pursued into the stretch then gave way past mid stretch.

DARLING'S CURE stalked the pace, circled the turn four deep, gained the lead outside MEMPHIS MAFIA near the sixteenth pole then drew out. MEMPHIS
MAFIA chased the pace three wide around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, failed to hold off the winner but finished willingly. POLISH COOKIE
hugged the inner rail on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch for clear room and rallied mildly outside foes. UNION ANNIE saved ground on the
turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and flattened out. SELF ASSURED chased the pace racing in the two path between horses and weakened in the
drive. TRICKY SPIRITS sprinted clear leaving the chute, was steered to the inner rail, set the pace along the rail and gave way in mid stretch. HEARTFUL ,
along the inner rail on the turn, was outrun. SAME MOON showed brief speed. SEVEN CLUBS , three wide mid turn, swung to the four path entering the
stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
SWIRRLIE SHIRLIE rated nicely while saving ground and within range, eased out and edged up between rivals leaving the three eighths, cruised up four
wide and engaged the embattled leaders entering the lane, responded to strong handling and secured command in mid stretch, kicked away and was
steadily hand ridden the final yards. SUSIKIN had gate speed then rated back to be just off the dueling leaders leaving the far turn, eased out progressing
near the stretch, briefly waited behind foes, altered out for room in mid stretch, straightened and kept on with good energy. TAPETE CLAIRE , off the pace
and removed from the inside, circled four wide making some headway into the lane, continued progress to about the sixteenth marker then failed to
seriously sustain. JOYFUL NOISE broke a step slow, angled four wide advancing into the lane, chased between runners in mid stretch but came up empty.
R TRUE SENSATION broke awkwardly, recovered and edged up between foes, quick bid outside ONE ODD STORY nearing the turn, dueled outside that
one and gained a slim lead into the lane, stayed well to about the sixteenth marker then faded. NIGHTMARE , three wide under asking past the three
eighths, swung wider for the drive and had a mild kick. TRAPPE ME LATER , off the pace, cut the corner into the lane, eased out to move up some in mid
stretch, angled back in but failed to seriously follow through. ONE ODD STORY had speed to take over early, was hooked from her outside entering the
turn, fought on to upper stretch then tired.

Footnotes
DIVINE INTERVENTIO edged up between rivals near the five eighths and took a stalking position, closed in under strong handling and engaged
JAMMINWITHBRANDON past the three sixteenths, dueled, took a short lead with a sixteenth remaining, was fully extended to hold sway then stumbled
during the gallop out. JAMMINWITHBRANDON bobbled soon after the break, regrouped and to take command, was hooked from his inside and sparred
early, shook clear near the three quarter pole, set the pace inside, was collared heading towards mid stretch and kept on valiantly to the wire. MY MAN
POTS N PANS settled off the pace while saving some ground, raced two wide with momentum into the lane, eased out in the final furlong and slowly
gained. DON'T POKE THE CAT , three wide advancing past the five eighths, chased while removed from the rail into the lane but came up empty. TAP THE
MARK , four wide, lacked a stretch response. ZAYA broke a step slow and was outrun. DOTHAT DANCE rushed up to the inside of
JAMMINWITHBRANDON leaving the chute, vied briefly, chased into the turn while saving ground then faltered.

Footnotes
FOLE'S NOTION , along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the four path entering the stretch, closed nicely outside horses, led late and drove clear.
PORTAL ONE prompted the early pace, gained a two wide lead near the three eighths pole, opened up in mid stretch and weakened late. SPEIGHTSTER
RED , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, failed to rally in an even effort. TIPYOURHATTOTHAT worked between horses most of the trip and
lacked the needed rally. SHANGHAIED ASTORIA , in close quarters at the start, raced near the rail and encountered traffic in mid stretch. IRON PEARLS ,
a forward factor in the four path on the turn, weakened. FRANCIS X. sped to the early lead, raced along the inner rail and tired.
