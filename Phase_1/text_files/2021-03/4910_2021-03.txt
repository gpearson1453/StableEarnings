Footnotes
RIFLE MAN went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, drafted in the two path on the far turn, shifted four wide from behind foes late on that bend,
ranged up to make a bid into the stretch, cruised to the lead at the furlong marker, kicked clear when asked at the sixteenth-pole and proved best under
steady handling. TAKING NOTES bumped lightly with a foe at the start while hustled, went three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside,
dropped back near the half-mile pole, re-bid late on the backstretch, vied in the three path under urging on the far turn, took the lead under the crop into the
stretch, lost the advantage to the winner while drifting in at the furlong marker, bothered ALMA DERBY in the process and was outfinished while clear for the
place. REMEMBERMIS bumped lightly with a rival at the start, saved ground on the first turn, settled under some urging, raced inside on the far turn, moved
out under a drive around the furlong marker and finished willingly for the show. ALMA DERBY went to the front, raced inside on the first turn, set the pace
with some company, moved clear with a half-mile to run but was challenged again late on the backstretch, vied inside to the two path on the far turn, was
asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead under the crop into the stretch, was taken up when TAKING NOTES drifted in front at the eighth-pole and tired.
FROM NOW ON went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while two to three wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch
under a strong drive and lacked the needed kick. LOOKING FOR BULL went three wide on the first turn, was urged along on the backstretch, went three to
four wide on the far turn, moved out under a drive around the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. IMPRESSIVE STUDENT broke a step slow
then tossed his head while taken in hand early, went three wide on the first turn, settled near the back, was taken in hand midway down the backstretch then
moved out around the seven-sixteenths, was roused while making a five wide run on the far turn, gained while carried six wide late on that bend, chased
outside into the final furlong then weakened. TENSAS TODDY bobbled at the start, angled in early, saved ground on the first turn then moved out leaving
that bend, tracked outside on the backstretch, was asked four wide on the far turn then carried five wide late on that bend, dropped back into upper stretch
and came up empty. STAR BANJO went four wide on the first turn, was urged along on the outside, raced four wide while ridden along on the far turn and
failed to respond. SENATOR CON broke awkwardly and was off a bit slow, tossed his head badly then was taken up early, continued under steadying
restraint with the rider against the bit, moved from the inside to the two path on the first turn, settled at the rear, drifted out around the half-mile pole then
was carried out near the seven-sixteenths, went five wide on the far turn and was no factor. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF ALMA DERBY
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST TAKING NOTES ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, TAKING NOTES WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE EIGHTH-POLE

stretch and prevailed under strong urging. FLASHBURN was hustled from the start, disputed the pace on the inside of MISTER DON, vied in the two path
on the turn, dueled with the aforementioned foe in the stretch and missed while clear for the place. ANTIETAM ROAD bumped with a rival at the start, was
urged along on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and earned the show. OUR LAST SHOT was taken up briefly

with a rival at the start, was urged along on the outside, went six wide on the turn then came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
PERMANENTDETENTION was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, dropped back while shuffled a bit behind KANNON WITH A K near the
half-mile pole then dropped in, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, came three wide into the stretch, had the rider lose his whip inside
the three-sixteenths and was no factor. SOUTHERN LIGHT was bumped at the start and forced in, recovered to establish a good position just off the pace,
saved ground on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch then drifted further out and came up empty. REPOSADO broke in
and bumped with a foe, settled off the pace, moved out late on the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, was carried out in upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
BLAMEWORTHY showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was headed inside the five-sixteenths,
responded well when set down in upper stretch then regained the advantage, shook clear coming to the furlong marker and proved best under strong
urging. HE'S IN CHARGE was urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, lugged in while chasing the winner in the stretch, was corrected with
tugs of the right rein and safely secured the place. A C EXPRESSWAY brushed with a rival at the start, was urged along on the outside, went three then
four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved position for the show. SHACKLEFORD STRONG was hustled from the start, pressed the
pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, took a short lead late on that bend, was roused into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong
and tired. REGULAR GUY was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. INSPECTOR FROST brushed with a rival at the
start, was urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
VIOLENT WAYS moved in while going to the front, controlled the action while inside through the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch and
drew clear under steady urging. DRAKKAR bumped hard with a rival at the start then bumped with another foe, tracked the pace down the backstretch,
inched closer in the two to three path on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place.
STATE TREASURER bumped with a foe after the start, settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the
needed kick while able to get the show. CHEERS TO BERTI broke in then bumped with foes on both sides after the start, was well placed down the
backstretch, raced inside to the two path on the far turn, chased the winner into the final furlong and weakened. EDEN GREY'S KITTEN settled on the
outside, was urged four to five wide on the turn and failed to rally. GREELEY'S BANKER bumped hard with a rival at the start then was taken up, settled at
the rear, went around the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch then moved further out around the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. IM
A COWBOY TOO broke in at the start, settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, angled out under a drive in upper stretch and was no
factor. BIBLEMAN was coaxed along on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn and came up empty. MR. PRIORITY was last to commence then
reserved near the back, saved ground on the turn, came out into the stretch and was no factor. (Rail at 25 Feet) ALL TIMES WERE HAND-TIMED DUE TO

MUCHO MACHO MOMMA went four wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the far turn, took the lead
outside the quarter-pole, shook clear into the final furlong and drew away under steady handling. MAYBE LATER was reluctant to load, went three wide on
the first turn, tracked the pace down the backstretch, made a bid near the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path while between horses on the far turn,
battled under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match for the winner while just able to get the place. FAMOUS ATTRACTION went around the first turn
in the two path, set the pace while in hand, vied inside while under attack on the far turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole, battled under a drive in upper
stretch and proved no match for the winner then just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show. CLOSET SHOPPER was a bit keen under
restraint early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was rated off the pace, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was roused three wide into the
stretch, bumped with a rival around the three-sixteenths, drifted out into the final sixteenth and just missed the trifecta. WICKED BISOU went two to three
wide on the first turn, settled near the back, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response.
LADY FROSTED broke a step slow, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged three to four wide on the far turn, bumped
with a rival in upper stretch and came up empty. CANDYWRAPPER CRAZY broke out and hit the gate, was rank under restraint in the five path on the first

Footnotes
BARLEEWON had a rival clip his heels early, saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace, drafted in the two path on the far turn, swung five wide
into the stretch, rallied on the outside, took over in upper stretch then shook clear and prevailed under strong urging. COMEDIAN saved ground while
reserved off the pace, came under urging outside the five-sixteenths then drafted behind horses, cut the corner into stretch, hesitated while in tight against
the rail at the three-sixteenths, pursued the winner to the wire and finished willingly for the place. GUNNISON went three wide on the first turn, was reserved
on the outside, came under urging while four wide on the far turn, was carried six wide into the stretch, chased past the three-sixteenths and weakened but
earned the show. BROTH went around the first turn in the two path, settled well back in the field, moved closer while three wide on the far turn, swung
seven wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. YOUVESAIDITALL bumped with a rival after the start, went around the first turn in the two
path, settled off the pace, raced inside on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and also lacked the needed response. ANTARCTIC went four
wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside under snug restraint, went three wide on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and came up
empty. MARAUD went to the front, raced inside on the first turn, set the pace while in hand, vied inside on the far turn, spun into the two path entering the
stretch then lost the advantage and gave way. CLINT MAROON (GB) was taken under a very tight hold early, went around the first turn in the two path,
stalked the pace under vigorous restraint while inside of a foe, rounded the far turn in the two path, was put to a drive while three wide into upper stretch and
capitulated. ARMCHAIR JOCKEY bumped with a foe after the start then clipped heels, saved ground while well behind through the far turn, came three wide
into the stretch and was no factor.
