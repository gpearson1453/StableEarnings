Footnotes
DECEITFUL ANTHONY sprinted clear to an early lead up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn and held off a
late closer to save the win. COWBOY TUFF settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path approaching the three eighths
pole, closed steadily while drifting out slightly down the stretch and just missed. TODDLES raced inside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, ran into
traffic and bumped lightly with CLOUD TO GROUND near the half mile pole, navigated the turn from the two path, and gained ground mildly in the stretch
while proving to be no match for the top two. RENEGADE BOB was bumped by the horse to his inside leaving the gate, trailed the field on the outside up
the backstretch, raced in the three to four path around the turn and made no bid. CLOUD TO GROUND veered out and bumped with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, ran into tight quarters and was bumped by TODDLES heading into the turn,
raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and was empty from there.

Footnotes
BETTER ANGELS stalked outside the leader, bid two wide past the half, led narrowly near the seven sixteenths, edged clear from the three eighths,
asserted his lead when driven near the furlong mark, and won clear. COLOROFACLOUD came away slightly awkwardly, tracked the pace inside down the
backstretch, continued to track two wide on the turn, was urged near the five sixteenths, came three wide into the lane, loomed two wide in upper stretch,
proved no match for the winner past the three sixteenth but chased on with interest to prove second best. SHE APPEALS HOLY was off a bit slowly, settled
at the rear, was driven in the five to six path on the turn, floated out near the center of the track in upper stretch, improved under a drive, and passed tiring
horses while drifting in late. BELLA'S CHOICE raced between horses early, was wrangled back behind the tracking flight near the nine sixteenths, improved
again to track the leading pair while pushed along three wide between horses on the turn, went to a drive between horses in upper stretch but lacked the
necessary rally. MAJESTIC RAJ was urged to an early lead, was headed by BETTER ANGELS near the seven sixteenths, vied inside that foe to the three
eighths, proved no match from there, was driven inside in upper stretch but weakened steadily. THUNDER ISLAND settled in second last early, improved to
track the leading pair four wide on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, offered no response and faded.

Footnotes
RIO SECO bobbled in the opening strides, chased midpack early, tracked the leading pair outside of MONGOL BULL around the bend, took closer order
into the lane, went to a drive in upper stretch, rallied while drifted out and carrying COME ON DOVER out with him through midstretch, headed GREELEYS
ICE approaching the sixteenth pole, and held sway. PRESIDENT ELECT settled at the rear, raced in the five to six path on the turn swung out to the eight
path in upper stretch, went to a drive, found his best stride inside the furlong mark, continued to gain but could not catch the winner. COME ON DOVER was
reserved down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, swung out and was driven from the five to six path in upper stretch, improved position but
got carried out further as RIO SECO drifted out, and was outfinished in the final sixteenth of a mile. GREELEYS ICE raced midpack early, bid to engage
outside SEANSHINE past the nine sixteenths, dueled outside that foe while racing in the four path on the turn, drove clear in upper stretch, was headed
approaching the sixteenth pole and folded. SEANSHINE disputed the pace down the backstretch, dueled inside of GREELEYS ICE while racing in the three

Footnotes
COCO BRAVADO chased the leader between horses in the early going, launched a bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole, took over with a
furlong to go and drifted out while being ridden out to the wire. IMPERIAL TEMPLE chased the frontrunner between horses up the backstretch, navigated
the turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole and improved position while drifting in in the stretch to get up for second.
HATCHET CREEK bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and
gave way in the final furlong. DOES NOT STOP brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, trailed the field through the opening stages, raced in
the two path around the turn and made a mild gain of ground in the stretch. POQUITO MAN bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled in
to stalk the frontrunner up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and flattened out in the stretch. JULIO TUTWILER brushed with the horse to his
inside leaving the gate, settled in just off the pace on the outside, raced in the three path around the turn and tired entering the stretch.

Footnotes
VEGAN GOES BEST soon led while racing keenly, continued on a clear lead while saving ground through the far turn, went to a mild drive from upper
stretch and drew off in the final furlong. CHOLLA hit the gate while breaking outward, tracked the pacesetter inside of KARA'S ANGEL through the
clubhouse turn and down the back straight, continued to track in the two path on the far turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, was outpaced by the leader in
the final furlong but kept on with interest under a drive to prove a clear second best. SUMMER EXPRESS chased midpack, was pushed along from near the
half mile mark, saved ground through the far turn, went to a drive near the three eighths, lacked the needed kick but chased on well enough to stay clear for
show. WOOD NOT MIND was in tight during the opening strides, settled well off the pace, switched off the inside near the three eighths to try to get around
SUMMER EXPRESS, took closer order under a drive, swung out into the lane while still under a drive but lacked the needed rally. KARA'S ANGEL broke
inward, tracked the leader outside of CHOLLA through the far turn and down the backstretch, began to weaken from the seven sixteenths, lost ground in the
three to four path around the far turn, and continued to fade in the lane. LITTLE CHICK was slow into stride, soon trailed the field, swung out to the four path
into the lane and was pushed along, but offered no bid.

ANGELCENTS veered in sharply and bumped with the two horses to her inside at the break, dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, took
over headed into the turn, angled in to save ground, and held off the closers to save the win. TIZALADYBUG dueled for the lead early, dropped back to
settle in behind the leader headed into the turn, raced in the two path around the turn and chased the winner home. GET NONE was bumped by
ANGELCENTS leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and gained ground on the inside in late

down the lane. GUEST IN MY HEART was bumped hard by ANGELCENTS and blocked leaving the gate, trailed the field through the opening half mile,
saved ground around the turn and made no bid. HONEY MUG hit the gate leaving it, raced between horses in the middle of the pack up the backstretch,

Footnotes
STOPSHOPPINGAMY tracked the pace outside of OZETTE down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, went to a drive past the quarter pole,
chased behind the leading pair to midstretch, was taken outside of PLAY TWENTY approaching the sixteenth mark, rallied and got up in the final jumps.
TAPALONG was bumped lightly by OZETTE in the opening strides, sent to the lead, saved ground while clear on the turn and into upper stretch, was
headed by PLAY TWENTY approaching the furlong mark, kept on gamely under a drive, came back on that foe and led near home, but was nailed in the
final strides. PLAY TWENTY broke inward and bumped soundly with POLAR'S GRACE in the opening strides, began to improve three wide into the turn,
sustained a rally four wide around the bend, went to a drive in upper stretch while still three wide, headed TAPALONG approaching the eighth pole, carried
a narrow lead into the final sixteenth, but was outfinished between horses late. SIMPLY FAST settled toward the rear inside of POLAR'S GRACE, continued
in the three path inside of that foe on the turn, swung four wide into the lane, went to a drive approaching the three sixteenths, and improved mildly outside
of tiring horses. OZETTE broke inward and lightly bumped TAPALONG in the opening strides, tracked behind that pacesetter down the backstretch and into
the turn, lost position while saving ground on the turn, was driven inside past the quarter pole, and continued to weaken. GET N TIPSY chased midpack,
was pushed along in the three path on the turn and driven three wide into the lane, and came up empty. POLAR'S GRACE broke slightly outward and
bumped with PLAY TWENTY in the opening strides, settled toward the rear outside of SIMPLY FAST, raced in the rear flight in the four path on the turn,
swung five wide and was driven in upper stretch, but offered no response.
