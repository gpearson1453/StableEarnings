Footnotes
ORIGINAL INTENT settled comfortably off the pace while saving ground, was asked on the final turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, moved out while
rallying on the outside, took the lead outside the furlong marker and drew clear under steady urging. CHOP CHOP CHARLIE showed early speed then was
eased back off the pace, saved ground on the first turn, moved out nearing the second turn, went three wide on that bend, settled outside down the
backstretch, was asked three wide on the final turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out while chasing the leaders and finished willingly for the place
while no match for the winner. YA GOTTA WANNA went around the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside in the two path, turned up
the pressure on the final turn, was carried out while battling on even terms for the lead in upper stretch, fought on well into the final furlong and proved no
match for the winner then lost the place but held the show. PINE GROVE ROAD went to the lead before the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path,
showed the way through solid fractions while on the inside, was asked under pressure with a quarter-mile to go, drifted out under heavy pressure while
fighting on in upper stretch, battled into the final furlong and weakened then missed the show. SKYCRAFT settled off the pace while mostly three wide, was
urged five wide on the final turn and lacked the needed response. TAKE THAT FOR DATA was taken in hand early then reserved in the two path, came
under urging on the final turn and failed to rally. JIMMY D lagged at the rear of the field, went three wide on the second turn, saved ground on the final turn
and failed to respond. RUN TAPPY went three wide on the first turn, dropped in while off the pace, saved ground on the second and third turns then also
failed to respond. ARMCHAIR JOCKEY broke out at the start, settled while two to three wide, was urged four wide on the final turn and faltered. (Rail at 10
Feet)

Footnotes
WRAPPER RULE broke a step slow then was hustled, settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch, rallied
on the outside while still on her inside lead, made a bid coming to the furlong marker then took the lead inside that marker, drifted in outside the
sixteenth-pole while swapping to the proper lead and bothered foes, was straightened by the rider into the final sixteenth and prevailed. MISS MAMBA broke
a half-step slow, settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, moved out while gaining in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong, bumped
with a rival while looking for room outside the sixteenth-pole then steadied, regained momentum late and finished fast but missed while able to get the place.
RUMPUS pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead in the two path on the turn, led under a drive into the final furlong then was overtaken while able to
hold the show. FLATTERINGAPPLAUSE broke a half-step slow, settled nicely off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was given her cue in the two path at
the quarter-pole, dropped back to the rail inside the three-sixteenths, chased to the wire and was out-kicked. BLUE GRASS ANNA was forwardly placed
down the backstretch, chased three wide on the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong, was carried in by the winner outside the
sixteenth-pole, bumped with a rival at that point then checked and weakened. DEVIL WITH A DASH was urged along towards the rear, dropped back while
trying to get out a bit leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. HOODWINK set the pace under pressure to her outside, lost
the lead while along the rail on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. LIL BIT FUNNY veered out at the start and was off slow then corrected by
the rider, spotted the front many lengths, went around the turn in the two then three path and was no factor. (Rail at 10 Feet) FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY, WRAPPER RULE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED FIFTH FOR INTERFERENCE OUTSIDE THE SIXTEENTH-POLE

Footnotes
BEACHCOMBING bumped soundly with rival at the start then bumped again with that foe, strode clear early then opened up a sizable advantage in the two
path, remained well clear while inside on the far turn, responded well when put the crop in upper stretch and proved much the best under strong urging.
TOMA TODO went around the first turn in the two path, followed the solo leader down the backstretch, saved ground under urging on the far turn, pursued
the winner under a drive in the stretch and was no match but gamely earned the place. STANFORD (IRE) was taken in hand early, saved ground on the first
turn, settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out under a drive, battled with two foes for
the place and just missed that position while narrowly able to get the show. CARAMEL ANGEL went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, saved
ground on the far turn, fought for the minor awards in the stretch and just missed the trifecta. ATTORNEY TIM went four wide on the first turn, settled
towards the rear, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went three then four wide on the far turn, came seven wide into the stretch then moved out
significantly behind a drifting foe and failed to threaten. BRITTS A CLOSER bumped soundly with a foe at the start then bumped again with that opponent,
went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged two then three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch then moved further out
and failed to rally. LEMON KICK saved ground on the first turn, settled in the back half of the field, went two then three wide on the far turn, was driven six
wide into the stretch then drifted out badly coming to the three-sixteenths and was no factor. GOOD INTENT rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at
the rear, saved ground on the far turn and showed little. (Rail at 10 Feet)

MY WISE CAT broke in at the start, angled in early while showing speed, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, spun four wide
into the stretch, shook clear at the three-sixteenths, drifted in into the final furlong and proved much the best under a brisk hand ride. BORN AGAIN
GEORGE bumped hard with rivals on both sides early, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch
then moved further out and safely secured the place. WHY JOEY WHY clipped heels after the start, was urged along towards the rear, went three wide on
the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was along for the show. GREELEY'S BANKER broke a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went four
then five wide on the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. FREE INDEED was ridden along at the rear, went three wide on the
turn, angled out significantly nearing the sixteenth-pole and was no factor. SOUTHERN SWAGG brushed with a rival at the start, bumped hard with a foe
early, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn then spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. C'MON VE angled in quickly while
showing speed, disputed the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail on the turn and tired. BUCKETS bumped hard with a rival early then
