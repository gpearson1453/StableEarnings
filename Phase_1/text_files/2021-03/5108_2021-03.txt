clear, responded well to urging and stayed clear with a sixteenth to go, held off furious closer safely. BANZE NO OESTE (BRZ) far back early and settled
into a comfortable stride on the backstretch, continued far back entering the turn, made his move on the turn and gained ground quickly, in range entering
the stretch, split foes approaching the final sixteenth, and kept on gaining on clear leader to the wire. MO DINERO tracked leader along the inside on the
backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn, angled out aggressively entering the stretch three wide, kept to task in the lane and held third. CASH
ENCOUNTER tracked two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, floated out a path into the stretch, and bid four wide in the stretch, kept
on well and edged for show. TIME N MONEY pressed leader along the rail on the backstretch, continued to hold the rail on the turn, in range of leader in the
top of the stretch and gave way to the closers with a sixteenth to go. FORT LEWIS RIVERS chased leader two wide on the backstretch, continued in chase
mode entering the turn and faded entering the stretch. NUTTY SIERRA stalked pace on the backstretch and failed to ever launch a bid.
