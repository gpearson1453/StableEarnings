contention, eased back, raced outside around the second turn, made a bid and was a clear second at the wire. I'LL RAISE YOU void of early speed, made a
late bid and got up for third. HATTIES JEWEL lacked early speed, saved ground around the final turn, angled out entering the stretch and finished evenly.
ALLIDOISDREAMOFYOU sprinted to the front, drove clear and faded. SUCCESSFUL RYKER pressed the early pace, faded and was no threat late.

Footnotes
BAJAN CASH pressed the pace, moved up on the outside around the final turn, took command and was going away at the end. RED WINED UP
challenged for the early lead, raced close throughout, but proved no match for the winner late. JACK BE QUICK pressed the pace, made a mild bid, but
proved no match for the top two. MUNDO MUTADDA lacked early speed and was never close. HE'S AN HONEST MAN was rank at the start, quickly went
to the front, drove clear and was finished early.
