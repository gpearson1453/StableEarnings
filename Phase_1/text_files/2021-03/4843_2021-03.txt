Footnotes
NORTHERN GEM was unhurried to the backstretch then advanced outside rivals to attend the pace, dueled three wide to the stretch then edged away to
mid stretch and held stubbornly. MISS EVER READY trailed to the second turn, circled four wide to the stretch then finished willingly. LILA AT THE BEACH
contested the pace from the rail to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. TURA LURA was chasing the leaders to the second turn, raced
two wide then shifted out in upper stretch and was gaining belatedly. SAYITALL hustled to duel for the lead two wide for six furlongs, got outkicked in upper
stretch and weakened. BIG WISH also chased the leaders from the rail to the stretch then did not rally.

Footnotes
TERRYS TOM CAT was unhurried for a half mile, bid three wide into the second turn then swung out five deep into the stretch, rallied when straightened
and closed steadily to catch RIDEO on the wire. The latter stalked the pace to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms in mid
stretch, inched away from UPO a sixteenth out but could not stall the winner. UPO stalked the pace for a half mile, bid three wide and was along to duel for
the lead into the stretch, dueled to the sixteenth pole then was in tight off heels and outfinished. CONQUEST LEMONRAID was four wide to the backstretch,
settled to the second turn but had to circle six wide to the stretch and gave way in the drive. FIRE WHEN READY prompted the pace to the half, bid three
wide to engage for the lead on the second turn but tired in the final furlong. KYLEMORE was hustled to the lead, dropped over to the two path into the
backstretch, set a pressured pace to the second turn then was outrun to the stretch and tired. LITTLE JOHN had no speed, settled for a half mile then saved
ground to the stretch but gave way.

UNION DANCE settled mid pack to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms in mid stretch and battled determinedly to dead
heat. MECKLENBURG (IRE) was rank on the first turn, pressed the pace two wide to the far turn, dueled to the stretch then dug in gamely to tie UNION
DANCE for the win. HUGE BIGLY was settled for a half mile, raced two wide and moved up on the second turn then stayed on late. COMBAT ZONE set the
pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then weakened. GALLANT WARREN lagged for five furlongs, was three then four wide to the stretch
but could not make an impact. IRISH DECLARATION chased the pace for a half mile, was two wide on the far turn and came up empty in the drive. ORCZY
(IRE) had no speed, made a bid three wide on the second turn but weakened in the stretch.
