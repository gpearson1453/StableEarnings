Footnotes
GREENER PASTURES dueled for the lead inside of PARROT HEAD, kicked clear from that foe entering the lane, and held sway while hanging on his left
lead through the stretch. PARROT HEAD dueled for the lead outside of GREENER PASTURES, but proved no match for that foe entering the lane while
clinging to place from LAUNCH PAD, but was bested through the stretch by that foe for that position. LAUNCH PAD stalked along the inside, chased the
dueling duo from the three path around the far turn, inched closer turning for home, but failed to match strides with GREENER PASTURES through upper
stretch while bidding for place outside of PARROT HEAD, and secured that position through the late stages. I'M INTRIGUED lied off of the pace along the
inside, and failed to factor. MASTER OF WAR never got involved. BOONE'S SPIRIT lied forwardly placed three wide, but was done early.

Footnotes
CITY DRIFTER tracked from midpack four wide, stalked the leading duo from the three path around the turn, bid turning for home, swept past and drew off
approaching the three sixteenths pole, and was kept busy to the wire. CUZ lied off of the pace four wide while tracking CITY DRIFTER, followed that one's
move entering the lane to bid for place as that foe assumed command, forged that position in upper stretch, and safely held it to the wire. TOWN AGENDA
was off slowly and lagged well behind the field into the lane, shifted six wide in midstretch, and willingly improved while hanging on his left lead. FAST BOB
lied off of the pace two wide, circled five wide and outside of horses turning for home, but leveled off before menacing and lost show in the late stages.
SCATERRA chased while forwardly placed two wide, and faded turning for home. CHICKS FOR FREE saved ground while midpack around the turn, but to
no avail. ALGEBRAIC chased three wide before vying outside of his stablemate around the turn, then got overhauled by outer foes in upper stretch. FUNNY
BONE set the pace along the inside, vied inside of ALGEBRAIC around the turn, then wilted in upper stretch.

Footnotes
DECISION MAKER broke in a tangle and multiple lengths behind the field, improved position along the inside and saved ground around the far turn, then
sustained his rail advance through midstretch to drive past the outer pace setter with a sixteenth to go. SCABBARD tracked from midpack two wide, rallied
four wide around the far turn to bid for the lead outside of a pair of rivals with five sixteenths to run, but flattened out in upper stretch. FULCO established an
advantage into the first turn, maintained the loose lead down the backstretch before meeting a pair of bids into the far turn, fought off those rivals through
midstretch, but tired in the final furlong, was surpassed by an inner foe at the sixteenth pole, and faded thereafter. FRONT MAN stalked along the inside, bid
for the lead outside of the pace setter into the far turn, vied between horses turning for home, but was outkicked by an inner rallying rival in upper stretch,
then missed achieving place from between horses late. ARARECO LAKE stalked two to three wide, but failed to factor. EL AHIJADO never got involved.

Footnotes
SWEET SAMURAI dueled inside of DEFENDER OF FAITH, assumed command with five sixteenths to run, and widened her advantage through the final
furlong. CARLEXA tracked from midpack three wide, forged place behind the clear leader passing the quarter pole, and stayed clear of show thereafter.
MISS MCCOOL lied far off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide turning for home while meeting traffic problems, but split foes in upper stretch, and stayed
on mildly for a minor share. ESPECIALLY YOU chased along the inside, but tired before menacing. MINNIEMOREPROMISES tracked from midpack four
wide around the turn, but faded through the lane. DIMPLES OF VENUS lied far off of the pace, gained mildly in the five path turning for home, but hung on
her left lead through the lane and failed to threaten. MISS O' PRADO was never involved. CHLOE RENE lied forwardly placed two wide, but faded around
the turn. DEFENDER OF FAITH dueled for the lead two wide, but proved no match for her inner counterpart at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened. I'LL
GETTHEWHISKEY showed little.

Footnotes
SAMURAI PRINCE vied for the lead two wide early on, assumed command approaching the five sixteenths pole, drew off entering the lane, and widened
through the final furlong before being wrapped up approaching the wire. KIERKEGAARD tracked from midpack wide and from between horses, shifted five
wide turning for home to bid for place in midstretch, achieved that position passing the furlong marker, and held it from BIGMANCAN late. BIGMANCAN
saved ground far off of the pace, swung six wide in upper stretch, and rallied through the lane, but missed reaching place. HUG THE MUNNY rallied four
wide from midpack around the turn to bid for place turning for home, but faltered in midstretch. AREYAREADYFREDDY tracked from midpack along the
inside, then two wide at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to threaten the leaders. DIGITAL STAR failed to factor. CANDY COMA chased three wide, but
was outkicked for minor placings turning for home, and weakened. SWINGABIGSTICK never got involved. WINGING WAYS sparred for the lead inside of
the eventual winner, but weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole.

ELECTRIC AVENUE lied off of the pace three wide and between horses, split foes in upper stretch to commence a rally, and caught the leader approaching
the finish while outkicking outer rivals. AMANI'S KITTEN lied off of the pace two wide, swung five wide turning for home, produced a late bid outside of
ELECTRIC AVENUE approaching the wire, but was outfinished by that foe. RUN THIS TOWN lied off of the pace along the inside early on, swung seven
wide turning for home, and improved outside of foes through the lane. ZIPAWAY set the pace along the inside, showed the way around the turn before
drawing clear turning for home, but tired in the final furlong and was caught approaching the wire. BAYTOWN JIMBO trailed early on, came into the lane six
wide, and stayed on mildly. DIXIE HIGHWAY stalked two wide, chased the clear leader through upper stretch, shifted inside of that foe while getting
overhauled by outer rivals in midstretch, and failed to menace. PULL ME BACK lied off of the pace four wide, advanced to a three wide stalking position into
the turn, but faltered in upper stretch. SMUGGLER'S GHOST stalked along the inside, but came under coaxing into the turn, and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
FANDANCER settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted five wide approaching the final furlong, rallied with a stout late surge, and just got up at the
wire. CHA CHA MISSION settled off of the pace two wide, rallied behind foes through upper stretch, split rivals to produce a late bid approaching the wire,
but missed to an outer foe. BLUE ABBI ROAD pulled early on to duel for the lead inside of BARBALOOK, shook clear from that foe turning for home before
opening up in upper stretch, but hung on her left lead, tired through the final furlong, and got nailed on the wire by a pair of foes. LUCKY LAUREN lied off of
the pace three wide, rallied four wide turning for home, produced a bid approaching the wire via a long drive, but was outfinished by multiple foes, and
missed reaching show. BOLD FIGURE prompted the leaders three wide, chased the clear leader through upper stretch, but was outkicked by rivals on
either side in the late stages. ORGANZA never got involved. BARBALOOT dueled for the lead two wide, but faded at the five sixteenths marker, and
weakened through the lane. BLUE VAPOR TRAIL broke in a tangle, and never got involved.

Footnotes
INCLUSIVE rallied four wide into the far turn to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, reached the front via a long drive passing the sixteenth pole, and kept
ENGLISH CHALLENGE at bay to the wire. ENGLISH CHALLENGE lied off of the pace four wide around the far turn, surged approaching the wire to
complete a late rally, but missed. GOLDENPENCE set the pace along the inside, bumped to a clear margin down the backstretch, dug in through upper
stretch while meeting INCLUSIVE's bid, but was bested by that foe and another rival approaching the wire. SPEED GRACER lied forwardly placed two
wide, chased the leader through the lane while getting outkicked by outer foes, shifted in in midstretch, but failed to produce a bid. CHUCKLES CANDY
failed to factor. COME ON VENEZUELA made little impact. TORNADO BOY saved ground while stalking, but faded. SCIENCE TO WIN stalked two wide,
but chased the clear leader around the far turn before fading. RIVERS OF LITE never got involved. NEW YEAR'S LUCK lost all chance at the start when the
rider lost his irons, then was outrun thereafter.
