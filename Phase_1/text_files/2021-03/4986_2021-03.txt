1st turn, jumped tracks late with an eventful trip. BEOCCA off slow, tracked three wide to quarter pole but weakened late saving the show spot. SAVING
MAMA drifted out first turn, raced close up throughout with no late kick. BRONZE BEAST bothered into first turn, raced close up to the half but gave way.
ISOLATOR broke thru gate, reloaded with good early speed but was used up and gave way readily. HE'S NAUGHTY dwelt at the start and always far back.
KISSOFFTHEGLASS was through after the half and dropped back.
