GET HER READYEDDIE saved ground throughout then rallied and edged clear under a drive through the final furlong. THIRD TIME SUCCESS set a
measured pace off the inside, drifted out in the stretch and weakened. MISBEHAVING LADY chased three wide and continued willingly missing the place.
LADY CARMELA lacked speed inside then made a gradual gain while no threat. MO PARTY chased wide throughout and began fading on the turn.
BLESSED MOTHERMARY raced near the inside and was never in contention. CANDY TUNE SPIRIT broke awkwardly then trailed throughout while losing
ground.

Footnotes
HOLA PRINCESS stalked two wide, bid two wide on the backside, took over, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely inside rivals and turned back both bids
to prevail. ABACO DREAM hopped at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace, made a three wide run on the far turn, rallied outside rivals, dueled past
midstretch and dug in to earn the place spot. JUMPIN JETT stalked three wide, chased on the far turn, bid at the quarter pole, dueled between rivals in
upper stretch and was outkicked. GALILEO'S AFFAIR outrun early, moved up three wide on the far turn, angled in, rallied mildly late and just missed for
third. ROSE OF DUBLIN raced off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and failed to threaten. OUR CLAIRE BEAR set the early pace, then dueled inside
and faded. ROBIN'S DESTINY tracked along the inside, chased and gave way.

Footnotes
REFI broke slowest, settled in the two path, angled out in the stretch and was up late following a long drive. NO FLY ZONE set a pressured pace inside,
repelled challenges, was collared by the winner and battled gamely. RISING STORM well placed inside off the pace then flattened out in the stretch. BEST
START saved ground throughout and lacked a solid rally. JUST ENOUGH chased wide throughout and failed to menace. RODEO RED chased very wide
and weakened. MOUNTAIN TREE trailed early outside and was never a factor. GRAYS THE BAR pressed the pace outside for half a mile and stopped
abruptly.
