Footnotes
BUSINESS LADY went clear early, was well rated while setting a tepid pace in the two path, turned into the stretch under the crop, extended the advantage
into the final furlong, remained clear into the final sixteenth and just held while winning the head-bob on the wire. GOINGTOAGOGO settled on the inside,
was roused while swinging five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed fast to draw alongside the winner nearing the wire then was
out-nodded and denied on the wire but earned the place. GALILEAS PROMISE went around the first turn in the two path, was rated off the pace, rounded
the far turn in the two path, was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied into the final furlong, moved in while gaining into the final sixteenth and finished with
good courage for the show. ANNIE'S SHENANIGAN went four then three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the
far turn and weakened. SIMPLY BEGUILED broke a bit awkwardly, went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged four to five
wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. BEE HOUSE was keen into the first turn then came out six wide, remained
six wide through that bend, was rated on the outside, went three then four wide while asked on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up
empty. SWEET CONFUSION bumped the hindquarters of a foe while off a step slow, was taken under tight restraint early, went three wide on the first turn,
was reserved near the back, came under urging while three then two wide on the far turn and failed to respond. CRAZY GOOD was bumped in the
hindquarters at the start and turned sideways, settled while saving ground, was roused on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. I GOT WINGS was taken back early, lagged at the rear while racing in the two path, angled seven wide into upper stretch and was no factor. (Rail

Footnotes
CANTATA brushed the outside of the gate at the start, went two to three wide the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside under a snug hold, made a bid
while let out leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the far turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the runner-up in upper
stretch, drifted out some while battling with that foe into the final furlong, dueled to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. MINUTE WALTZ
broke awkwardly then bumped with a foe, went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked leaving the backstretch, chased in the
four path on the far turn, took a short lead in upper stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up, drifted out some near the sixteenth-pole and was denied while
clear for the place. SHE A HOT MESS went two to three wide on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, came under urging while three wide on the far
turn, swung six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. ZOOM UP was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, went to
the front, was well rated while setting the pace inside to the two path, came under pressure on the far turn, lost the lead passing the five-sixteenths, dropped
back into upper stretch and tired. KATIE'S KARAT broke out at the start, went five wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, traveled around the far turn in
the two path and was no factor. PEYTON ELIZABETH saved ground on the first turn, was rated just off the pace under a very strong hold, dropped back
while inside to the two path on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
GOLD DOUBLE was rated on the inside, moved closer with a half-mile to run, saved ground while drafting behind the leader on the far turn, altered course
to the outside of three foes in upper stretch, rallied on the outside, closed well to get the lead into the final sixteenth and prevailed under good handling.
TREASURY angled in while going to the front, set the clear pace in the two path, was asked under threat at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead under a drive in
upper stretch, dug in gamely to regain the advantage inside the furlong marker but was overtaken by the winner while able to get the place. SCARLET
FUSION bumped with a rival at the start, moved out early, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, advanced closer with a half-mile to run,
went four wide on the far turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, battled on even terms for the lead into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able
to get the show. GOLDENITE went three wide on the first turn, settled in second position, moved closer midway down the backstretch, went three wide on
the far turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, fought on even terms for the lead until near the sixteenth-pole then was out-kicked. PRIME TIME PLAYER
went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged three to four wide on the far turn and failed to respond. OLYMPIC CHAMPION went around
both turns in the two path and was no factor. NOMADIC FIGHTER broke in and bumped with a rival, dropped back between horses while carried out
nearing the first turn,went two to three wide on the turns, drifted in some near the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. AUTUMN RAGE bumped with foes
on both sides at the start, was forced out into the first turn, went four wide on that bend, settled off the pace, dropped back while inside on the far turn and
faltered.
