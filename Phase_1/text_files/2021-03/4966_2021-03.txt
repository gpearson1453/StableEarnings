Footnotes
RAASED, held up just off the leaders along the inside racing to the first turn, continued under light rating inside a rival in second flight to the backstretch,
shifted off the inside nearing upper stretch, was urged to bid for command three deep between foes entering the lane, wrested the advantage under
pressure and was gathered up in the final strides once the issue was decided. CAVEAT EMPTOR, forwardly placed between foes leaving the chute, was
rated just outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, moved to terms with that foe pressing the issue entering the far turn, gained the advantage
nearing upper stretch but proved no match for the winner in the drive. ASTROTURF, in touch with the leaders three deep leaving the chute, tracked the
leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight, was urged to advance shifting three deep nearing upper stretch, was fanned four wide entering the lane
and couldn't match terms with the top pair while edging a rival for a share. JARREAU was held up off the second flight while angling inwards racing to the
backstretch, split foes when presented an opening entering upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. CARMICHAEL, urged to the lead along the
inside, set the pace on a narrow margin racing to the far turn, dueled inside a rival through the second bend and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
POSEIDON'S PASSION shifted inwards just after the break carrying in GREGS POSSE, stalked the pacesetter under light rating between rivals racing to
the turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch to bid for command between foes entering the lane, then shifted inwards through the closing stages to turn back
SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT under firm left handed pressure and was taken in hand in the final strides. The latter tracked the pacesetter four deep as part of the
second flight racing through the backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep nearing upper stretch, was floated out slightly entering the lane, then
shifted inwards through the final furlong while just failing to match the winner's kick. CAUGHT UP IN YOU broke slowly, settled last near the inside racing to
the turn, shifted out splitting rivals racing into upper stretch and continued with interest three deep in the closing stages to edge a rival for a share. BLIP
SAYS BYE sprinted to the lead along the inside racing through the backstretch, dictated the pace to upper stretch and gave out leaving the furlong marker.
TROPICAL JOY flashed brief pace three wide between foes pursuing the pacesetter to the turn and emptied out early. GREGS POSSE hopped while
throwing her head at the start, then was carried inwards by the eventual winner just after the break, tracked the pacesetter along the rail racing to the turn
and retreated into upper stretch.

Footnotes
MOONSHINE STEVE angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival racing into the first turn, forged clear racing into the far turn and steadily extended his
advantage under pressure. KITTEN'S CLOWN, rated along the inside in the opening half, switched out midway through the backstretch, advanced three
wide through the far turn to upper stretch and edged rivals for the place honors. ON THE LIPS, bumped by SHIPWRECK, then forced into the path of NIP
OF BOURBON just after the start, dropped out last racing to the first turn, was prompted to gain position between foes avoiding tight quarters entering the
far turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and prevailed for a share. DIVINE CONTROL tracked just off the first flight in the three path racing to
the backstretch, then steadily faded between foes into upper stretch. NIP OF BOURBON, caught in tight quarters just after the start, was righted to track off
the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, gained some position nearing the far turn, steadied out of tight quarters entering the second bend,
then continued evenly between foes to late stages. SEA AND SAND settled along the inside, switched out avoiding traffic racing into the far turn but offered
no rally. OVERSHADOW, forwardly placed tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to lodge a brief bid entering the far turn but
quickly came up empty. VALUABLE PILLOW, urged along the inside disputing a rival's pace to the backstretch, gave way racing into the far turn.
SHIPWRECK broke inwards bumping ON THE LIPS while forcing that rival into the path of NIP OF BOURBON, was settled outside rivals in the last flight,
was caught wide racing into the far turn avoiding traffic and never proved a threat. SYMBOL AZTECA, caught in the four path racing to first turn as part of
the second flight, angled to the inside midway through the backstretch while being prompted to advance inside foes, checked out of tight quarters racing into
the far turn, then trailed the field into the lane. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE
FAR TURN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
RATTLESNAKE RIDGE broke readily, angled inwards forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, lost some ground to that foe while lugging inwards
midstretch but was corrected in time to narrowly prevail under pressure. GRAN CASIQUE broke sharply, was urged just off the inside in early stages
disputing the pace, dueled for command into the turn, then along the rail to late stages while gaining a brief advantage but was collared in the final strides.
TRULY STELLAR tracked off the first flight in the four path racing through the backstretch, advanced three wide on those foes nearing upper stretch and
continued willingly between foes to prevail for a share while closing the gap. OUTSTANDING DEBT settled well off the leaders racing to the turn, then
shifted inwards to split foes just off the inside in the closing stages with a belated rally. CHINOMADITO broke in the air losing position to the field, settled last
racing to the turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch and found his best stride late. FIRST HOMESTEAD tracked off the first flight along the inside racing
to the turn, shifted out four wide entering the lane but had no closing bid. SILENT MISCHIEF settled off the second flight and dropped out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
DAZZLING TRUTHS, reserved between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced on the leaders three wide into the far turn and
continued with a sustained response to edge SKIPPY'S STRIKE nearing the wire under firm handling. The latter broke sharply, angled to the inside setting
the pace on a comfortable margin to the backstretch. turned back a rival's bid to go clear racing past midstretch but just failed to contain the winner.
LAHINCH, held up along the inside racing to the backstretch, dropped out last on the far turn, swung out five wide entering upper stretch and continued
willingly to close the gap on the top pair nearing the wire. BIG TALL DAWG shifted out three wide early tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch,
advanced between foes to briefly challenge the pacesetter midway through the far turn but came up empty in the drive. AND WON tracked off the second
flight outside foes, was prompted to advance after a half while caught four wide racing into the far turn, then continued between foes in that path to late
stages making mild progress while being taken in hand nearing the wire. CAMMACK was rated along the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the first
turn, tipped out three deep in upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid while being gathered up in the closing stages. LONTANI hopped at the start,
settled last racing to the backstretch, continued along the inside into the lane but failed to menace. INFINITE angled to the inside racing to the first turn
tracking just off the pacesetter for a half, then steadily faded inside foes racing into upper stretch.

COMPANY STORE broke readily to gain terms prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue to upper stretch and went clear late under firm encouragement.
CAPTURED BY FATE broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing well off the rail into the turn, dueled through the bend to midstretch but
proved no match for the winner while besting the others. WEST SIDE WARRIOR angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing into the turn, then
shifted off the inside in the closing stages to edge a rival for a share. FLASH IT tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing into the turn, shifted out three
wide entering the lane and continued evenly late while being just outkicked for a share. SEATTLE COUNCIL tracked off the second flight along the inside
racing into the turn but offered no closing bid. FLYING BANKROLL settled along the inside racing through the backstretch, switched out with a sharp move
nearing the turn while crossing into the path of HALEL, forcing that rival to slip heels, swung out four wide entering upper stretch but lacked a rally. HALEL
settled outside foes in the last flight racing through the backstretch, was clipped by FLYING BANKROLL racing past the seven sixteenths marker dislodging
his rider but walked off the course under his own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT
NEARING THE TURN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
CONGRATS SMOKE was prompted to a forward placing outside foes leaving the chute while caught four wide into the first turn, gained a position just
outside the pacesetter racing three deep on the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path nearing upper stretch, then continued with a steady bid
into the lane to wrest the advantage and edge forward late under firm encouragement. T J MUNNINGS, held up between foes avoiding close quarters
dropping off the third flight racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes racing into the far turn while advancing sharply to contention, swung out four
wide entering upper stretch and continued with interest to prove best of the others. GATOR BITE was rated along the inside stalking just off the pacesetter
racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, was prompted to bid along the rail when presented an opening in upper stretch but was outkicked by
the top pair. POSEIDONS MYTH was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch, then
angled five wide in the closing stages but finished evenly late. NOTHIN REALLY, reserved while working his way to the inside racing to the backstretch,
switched out in upper stretch but passed only tiring foes. NO RENOVATIONS sped to the lead while angling over leaving the chute, dictated the pace just
off the inside racing to the far turn, then gave out abruptly between foes entering upper stretch. CAPTAIN LIO tracked off the second flight outside foes
racing to the backstretch and faded after a half. TOLL GATE broke slowly, was prompted to regain some position just after the start, then was rank under
restraint between foes while held up out of close quarters leaving the chute and dropped out early. IS IT BY CHANCE, caught five wide avoiding some traffic
racing to the first turn, dropped out early. CALL ME KALEN trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PACHI broke readily to gain a narrow advantage racing outside the field leaving the gap, angled inwards racing through the backstretch dictating the pace
on a narrow advantage racing in three path entering the turn and held sway to late stages remaining off the rail while being kept to right handed pressure.
ALMONASTER, forwardly placed six wide tracking just outside the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, shifted inwards racing into the bend while
continuing in steady pursuit of that rival into upper stretch but proved only second best. CHRISTMAS PRESENT, off a step slowly, gained a position tracking
off the second flight along the rail racing through the backstretch, switched out splitting rivals leaving the turn, angled four wide in upper stretch and
continued willingly to close the gap while earning a share. TINKER'S PAL, in touch with the second flight racing four wide, then three wide between foes
racing into the turn, weakened inside rivals late. ERIN GO BRAUGH, caught in tight quarters five wide between foes after the opening quarter, was
prompted to split foes three wide racing into the turn gaining brief contention but lacked the needed late bid. SUNNY SAINT broke inwards bumping DENY
at the start, switched outside foes to race eight wide through the backstretch and passed only tiring rivals. DENY, bumped at the start, then held up avoiding
tight quarters in early stages, angled outside foes racing into upper stretch but offered no rally. NELSON LEGEND ducked in at the start, then switched
outside foes in the opening furlong, was prompted to make brief progress racing five wide into the turn but soon faded. JUPI'SRESURRECTION broke
slowly and trailed the field to the stretch. LUCA DREW THE ACE, urged to brief contention inside rivals on the backstretch, steadily faded racing into the
turn. UPRISE, urged between foes in second flight racing through the backstretch, was held up avoiding tight quarters nearing the turn and quickly gave
way.

Footnotes
RAVIR, angled to the rail racing through the chute while taking up a position just off the second flight, continued inside foes gaining some position racing into
the far turn, switched off the inside racing through the far turn briefly awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, then shifted three deep entering the lane
while readily advancing to challenge and wrested a narrow advantage in time under some hand urging. BAFFLE 'EM came through tight quarters at the start
to steadily advance to a position outside a rival in the second flight tracking the leaders from well out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, shifted
three deep entering the second bend while making steady progress, moved to challenge for command in that path nearing upper stretch, contested the
issue between foes to late stages but couldn't contain the winner while edging a rival for the place honors late. TAYET, forwardly placed along the rail in the
opening furlong, conceded the lead while switching off the inside racing to the backstretch to track the pacesetter from just out of striking distance, was
prompted to close the gap on that foe nearing the far turn, bid for command between foes racing into upper stretch, contested the issue to late stages but
was outkicked by the top pair. SPATIAL dislodged his rider in the post parade to run loose momentarily to the main track chute before the start, shifted to
the inside racing to the first turn leading the second flight from out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, shifted out while being prompted to advance
between foes, lost some ground to the leaders entering the far turn, then came around tiring foes while angling to the inside racing into upper stretch and
continued willingly to close the gap late. FEDERALIST PAPERS, reserved along the inside in the opening stages, switched out entering the backstretch,
swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and made some mild progress. HIGHER TRUTH (IRE) ducked inwards in the opening stages, then was held
up along the rail dropping out last racing to the backstretch, swung out entering upper stretch but made no real impression. NOT SHY settled between foes
in the last flight racing to the backstretch, switched out nearing the second bend to make brief, four wide progress on the far turn but came up empty
entering upper stretch. ROSE GOLD settled outside foes racing in the last flight to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. EVENTIDE (FR) angled
inwards racing through the chute while pulling his way to the lead into the first turn, dictated the pace on a comfortable advantage racing to the second bend
and emptied out racing past the quarter mile marker.
