Footnotes
MISS JENNY'S HALO vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, was all out and held on for the win. RAMAAH lacked early speed, moved up
between rivals around the second turn, made a late rail bid and needed more. CHITTO pressed the pace, raced four wide around the first turn, was close
throughout and proved no match for the top two late. DATA LOAD raced within striking distance, came around the final turn on the outside, made a bid and
hung. SOBEK raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, came around the second turn wide, showed late interest, but was no factor. GRAND LITTLE
MAN raced near the back at the start, moved up, five wide around the second turn and finished evenly. GOLDEN PALACE pressed the pace, faded and
was no threat late. CORVETTE SPIRIT void of early speed and showed little. MR LEO flashed brief speed and dropped back.

MOSTLY AWESOME broke out, racing in the rear, moved up, pressed the pace and drove clear down the home stretch. RUBY SIOUX unhurried in the
early part, racing inside down the backside, swung out around the final turn, made a bid, couldn't match strides with the winner, but was a clear second.
ROCK THE JUKEBOX went to the front, forwardly placed throughout, but lacked a late kick. COSTA SUGAR void of early speed, raced four wide around
the second turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. FIANNA HILLS pressed the early pace, saved ground and weakened. TEMPLE SHADOW raced in the
middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. TOODALOO TO YOU always raced near the back and was outrun. MIZZ TUTU raced within contention and
dropped back.

GREELEY'S DEALER stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up around the final turn, pulled away and finished well. JOHNNYSJOURNEY raced
within contention, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was best of rest. KRAFTY BOY unhurried in the beginning, raced
outside around the second turn, made a late bid and was along for the show. FORESTDUNGONE dueled on the front end, saved ground around the final
turn and faded. I'M D'CAT lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. CLASSIC GREELEY raced within striking distance, faded and finished
evenly. BINDING always raced near the back and put forth a dull effort. ALEX'S TURN challenged for the early advantage and retreated to the back.

Footnotes
DEBONNAIRE DUDE challenged for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the stretch and proved the best late. ADIOS YANKEE
vied for the early lead, dueled throughout, was outfinished for the win, but was best of rest. WHISKEY'S GONE raced within contention, saved ground
around the final turn and finished evenly behind the top two. APALACHEE BAY raced within striking distance, came around the final turn on the outside,
finished evenly, lacking a bid. DUBNATION lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. VALLEY OF THE HIDE raced in the middle of the
field, had an outside trip and put forth an even effort. WRATH had an awkward start, broke slow and was never a threat. TEN SILVER PINS void of early
speed and showed little. CAEUS IN PASADENA raced near the middle of the field and retreated.
