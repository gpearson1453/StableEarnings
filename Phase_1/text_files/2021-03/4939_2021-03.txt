Footnotes
I'M A ROCKETTE was unhurried early, traveling four wide down the backstretch and into the turn, slipped onto the rail for the stretch drive, and made a
game late bid to get the win. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP sat early fractions while saving ground, was urged for run in the stretch but could not hold off I'M A
ROCKETTE in the final stages. DRAW ME was unhurried early, maintained a two wide trip along the turn and into the stretch, gained position and finished
willingly for third. MIDNIGHT SUNRISE settled off early pace while saving ground, advanced position along the turn but was outrun into the stretch and
finished evenly. SPRING HEAT sat just off of the early pace while traveling three wide down the backside and around the turn, lost position coming into the
stretch and finished evenly. THE SPIRAL JETTER had no early speed, was three wide down the backside, angled over to the two path for the stretch drive
but had no late response. UNO TROUBLE MAKER stalked the early pace from the two path along the backstretch and turn, lost position coming into the
stretch and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
DARKSABER was sent for speed, dueled two wide to the stretch then responded and kicked away under steady urging. AUBURN STREAK also was under
urging early, chased the leaders from the rail to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch but gamely got the place. LUCKY CAUSE had no speed, swung out
five wide for room into the stretch then did not threaten the winner and missed the place. SIZZLING INDIAN was chasing to the turn, got fanned four wide to
the stretch but lacked the needed late response. TEXAS BOB broke a bit slow, had no speed, was three wide on the turn but failed to threaten in the drive.
CIEN POR CIEN was used early to attend the pace outside the winner and three wide to the stretch then tired. AMBITIOUS ME got outsprinted to the turn
then saved ground to no avail. PROOF OF PARANOIA had no speed and was not a factor.
