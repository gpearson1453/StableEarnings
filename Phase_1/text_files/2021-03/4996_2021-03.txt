Footnotes
IT MAKES SENSE broke sharply to duel for the early advantage with SLEWS HYMN, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive and was up in a head
bob. SLEWS HYMN was away in good order to dispute the early fractions with the winner, vied with that foe through a vigorous final furlong, just missed and
was vanned off. DYNAMIC RULER settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. NUMEROLOGIST
lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished evenly late. CATS BLAME lagged early, raced off the rail
through the turn and did not threaten. CONQUEST SMARTEE showed brief speed and weakened. BUCKLEY BAY pressed the pace of the dueling leaders
from the inside for the opening quarter and weakened.

Footnotes
PRINCE CAIRO raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew off. IZERIGHT lacked early foot,
raced off the rail through the turn, reached the leaders into the lane, led and yielded to the winner. SIR DEPUTY chased the leaders while racing four-wide,
moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths pole, gained a brief lead and gave way. SMOKING GUN was off a step slow then hustled along , settled
off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and did not menace. EXILED was away in good order to set a
pressured pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. TEQUILA TIME chased the leaders while racing five-wide and gradually
weakened. OXBOW PARK was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LOOKOUT TAYLOR settled off the leaders early, advanced four-wide through the second turn, angled inside UH OH SEVEN into the stretch, reached the
fore with a sixteenth to run and drew off. STARLIGHT TWIST lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and finished with good late energy. UH OH SEVEN was away alertly to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the half
and gave way through the final furlong. PULPIT SINGER pressed the pace while racing three-wide and lacked the needed late response. REAL GOOD
DEAL raced four-wide through the first turn, moved five-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. LA MER was forwardly placed from off the rail
throughout and gradually weakened. ORATORY GLORY was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. SUBTLE
RIDE raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened. COME HOME CHANCE chased the leaders while racing
four-wide for a half and weakened.

Footnotes
COLONEL TRAVERS was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and was ridden
out to be kept to task. DYRDEK lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished with a steady bid.
ATTA BOY BILLY pressed the pace of the winner while racing four-wide and gave way to that rival after going a half. FLIGHT SPEED settled off the leaders
early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. LEGAL WEAPON was forwardly placed from off the rail and gradually weakened.
PAPERBOY JERRY lagged early, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. MCTHUNDER raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide
through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
TIZ DONNA BELLA stalked the pace of WRIGHT WINGED while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew off.
BABY ROSE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and finished with a steady bid to gain the
place. MY FUNNY GAL lacked early foot, moved eight wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. WRIGHT WINGED sprinted clear at once,
remained in control through mid-stretch but could not resist the winner late. INVODKAWETRUST settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
turn and lacked the needed late response. FABLES LOVE AFFAIR showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not threaten.
TILLTHELUVRUNSOUT was forwardly placed, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. JADEY AT THE BAR lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BELLA FIGURA (IRE) was away in good order to stalk the pace of LETS PARDI MARTI while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and drew off through the final furlong. LETS PARDI MARTI opened a clear lead before going a quarter, raced off the rail while setting
the pace and gave way to the winner after going three-quarters. JAZZY EINSTEIN was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the
second turn and gained the show. STREET SONATA raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn, drifted out in mid-stretch
and finished evenly late. SALSA VERDE was taken back at the start, raced five-wide through the second turn, checked nearing the sixteenth pole and failed
to gain late. DIVINE BLESSING chased the leaders while racing four-wide for a half and weakened. GOOD FOR NOW settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed rally. THE MALLARD QUEEN lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn,
angled out further in mid-stretch and did not menace. MEAN SHARON raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn and
weakened.
