HE'S ROYALTY, urged to a forward placing three deep prompting the pacesetter, continued with a steady bid in that path to challenge for command nearing
midstretch and edged forward to a narrow advantage nearing the wire under firm right handed pressure. JUMP BACK JACK angled to the rail while being
urged inside foes prompting the pace, pressed the issue into upper stretch and continued willingly to the end while just failing to match the winner.
HARRYKEEPTHECHANGE urged to the lead while angling over in the opening stages, set the pace between rivals on a narrow advantage racing into the
bend, dueled into upper stretch and yielded to the top pair nearing the wire. HIGHJUMP CHARLIE, off slowly, was settled near the inside and failed to
menace. TIZ TRIUMPHANT settled off the first flight racing four wide on the backstretch and dropped out nearing the lane. HE HAS NO FRIENDS WAS
CAST IN THE GATE PRIOR TO START WHILE MAKING SOME CONTACT WITH PAPA LUKE, NECESSITATING EACH RUNNER'S LATE SCRATCH.

Footnotes
DANCESWITHBOURBON tracked just off the pacesetter between foes racing through the backstretch, conceded some position to the leaders while shifting
out three deep nearing upper stretch but continued with a steady late response to wear down those rivals in time under firm left handed encouragement.
FLIPPANT, in touch with the pacesetter three deep racing through the backstretch, moved to press the issue nearing upper stretch while shifting inwards,
struck the front midstretch but couldn't contain the winner while prevailing narrowly for the place honors. MOANAS POWER broke sharply, dictated the pace
on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail racing to the turn, shifted inwards disputing the issue grudgingly past midstretch but couldn't contain the top pair.
OPULENT WAYS tracked just off the pacesetter along the rail in the opening quarter, was held up avoiding tight quarters racing past the seven sixteenths
marker, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. FOR SURE tracked off the second flight along the inside but offered no
rally. LADYS CROSS trailed throughout.

Footnotes
INDY LYON sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch to the far turn, shook clear in upper stretch and
was kept to steady pressure. DELAWARE DESTROYER was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper
stretch being prompted to advance four wide into the lane and continued with interest to prove best of the others. TAPSASIONAL tracked just off the
pacesetter near the inside in the opening stages, shifted out to make a brief bid between foes into the far turn, lost some position entering the lane but
edged a rival for a share in the closing stages. WESTWARD LOOK tracked the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the first turn, shifted three wide on the far
turn while being urged to challenge nearing upper stretch but faded in the drive. NIGHT THINGS angled inwards racing to the backstretch to track off the
second flight, switched out nearing upper stretch but had no rally. FORMAL TREASURE, caught four wide racing to the backstretch, settled outside foes
and dropped back after a half.

Footnotes
IRISH VALOR, settled last near the inside racing to the backstretch, switched out racing into the far turn to commence a steady, four wide advance racing
into upper stretch, wrested the advantage under mild urging in late stages and was taken in hand nearing the wire once the issue had been decided. PLATO
was hustled to the lead outside foes racing into the first turn, set the pace a bit off the rail to the second bend, dueled inside a rival while shifting to the rail
racing into upper stretch, couldn't contain the winner's late bid but continued with a grudging effort to prevail for the place honors late. CANDY COVE,
forwardly placed three wide racing to the backstretch while just off the pacesetter, advanced racing into the far turn to press the issue, gained a narrow
advantage nearing upper stretch but flattened out once headed by the winner late. PHILO switched off the inside racing to the backstretch tracking the
leaders between foes in second flight, shifted out to race three deep on the far turn and continued evenly into the stretch. PROFESSIONAL angled to the
inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch and steadily faded after a half. MIGHTY GHOST, reserved between foes in early stages, was
fanned three wide to the backstretch tracking the leaders as part of the second flight but retreated after a half.

Footnotes
ST JOE VIPER was rated off the first flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, switched out entering the far turn while being prompted to advance
three, then four wide into upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to narrowly prevail on the wire under brisk right handed pressure. SILVER
EDGE, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, steadily moved to terms with the pacesetter while shifting inwards
after a half, pressed the issue on the far turn edging forward to a narrow advantage racing into the lane, grudgingly resisted the winner's bid to the end and
just missed on the wire. MONEY HOUSE, urged to the lead along the inside, set the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, dueled for command
inside a rival entering the far turn and gave way leaving midstretch while continuing well enough to last for a share. DEBDURITE, in touch between foes
prompting the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, was eased off the first flight while shifting out racing into the far turn to race three wide between foes into
the lane but had no closing response. SHAKEM N BREAKEM settled well off the leaders racing to the backstretch, was fanned five wide into upper stretch
but made no impression. SILENT MISCHIEF stumbled at the start, dislodging his rider but walked off the course under his own power after being collected
by the outrider. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE INCIDENT AT THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
TWIRLING STAR moved to gain a forward placing stalking just off the pacesetter under light rating racing to the backstretch, steadily moved to terms with
that rival entering the second bend, pressed the issue leaving the midway point of the far turn, shook clear racing into upper stretch and maintained a safe
advantage under firm handling. FOXGLOVE, caught in tight quarters when squeezed by RAZZLEDAZZLEM, then forced into DANCE ALONG DEDE at the
start, was settled along the rail collecting her stride racing to the first turn, continued under patient handling to the second bend, switched outside foes on the
far turn, swung five wide racing into upper stretch and was going well late to finish on even terms with a rival for the place honors while closing the gap on
the winner. MAJESTIC QUEEN broke inwards bumping RAZZLEDAZZLEM forcing that rival inwards, was righted while angling to the inside to track off the
first flight inside foes, saved ground on the far turn gathering momentum, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to finish
on even terms with a rival for second. RAZZLEDAZZLEM, bumped soundly while forced into FOXGLOVE at the start, was righted to track off the second
flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance, then continued evenly in that path
through the closing stages. AIR FORCE PINK angled inwards racing to the first turn to track just off the leaders between rivals in the second flight racing to
the backstretch but steadily faded into the far turn. BEAUTY GENIUS came through close quarters in the opening stages to track off the second flight along
the inside racing to the far turn but offered no rally. BEACH CHICK, urged to a forward placing tracking the leaders three wide in second flight racing to the
far turn, faded between foes nearing upper stretch. LADY JEAN sped to the lead while angling to the rail leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow
margin into the backstretch, dueled for command on the far turn into upper stretch and gave way. DANCE ALONG DEDE, bumped, then forced in at the
start while momentarily dislodging her rider from his left iron, raced a bit erratically while her rider adjusted his equipment racing to the first turn and soon
dropped out.

Footnotes
RUMELI, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, went clear racing into upper stretch and held sway to the
end under firm encouragement. SEARCHING FOR GOLD, in touch attending the pace in the opening stages, continued in steady pursuit of the winner into
upper stretch but couldn't gain terms with that foe while proving best of the others. DYNABLUE tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the
backstretch, shifted out three wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance and edged a rival for a share. KING RAMOS tracked the leaders outside
foes in second flight to the backstretch, shifted inwards a bit to gain position nearing the lane but weakened racing past midstretch. RUSH DELIVERY (IRE)
tracked off the second flight along the inside, switched out gaining some position between foes lane entering the lane but lacked the needed rally. EL
AFORTUNADO tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the far turn but never gained contention. NEFARIOUS FELLA angled to the inside
tracking the leaders as part of the second flight but steadily faded nearing the lane. VENEZUELAN WINNER proved no factor. INTO PARADISE showed
little. SOAKING WET was a brief factor between rivals in second flight but gave way abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
GROWL TIGER broke readily, sped to the lead just off the rail racing through the backstretch, widened his margin to a commanding advantage racing into
upper stretch and was kept to firm right handed pressure. EASY DAY angled to the inside racing past the chute while being urged to prompt the pacesetter,
lost terms with that foe after the opening quarter, shifted off the inside racing into upper stretch but continued with interest to prove best of the others. OL
GREY GHOST angled inwards tracking just off the leaders in the opening stages, shifted out three deep on the turn while being prompted to advance and
prevailed for a share in the closing stages. MYQUEST, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening quarter, faded between
rivals nearing upper stretch. CREATIVE CHOICE tracked off the second flight four wide racing through the backstretch and continued in that path to the
closing stages in an even effort. DOUBLE DEMON, slow into stride while racing along the inside early, switched outside foes entering the stretch but never
gained contention. RED BARI broke slowly while being bumped by SARATOGA DANCER and never proved a threat. CAIRO EMPIRE ducked inwards at
the start, was settled well out of striking distance off the inside racing to the turn and failed to menace. SARATOGA DANCER shied inwards at the start
bumping RED BARI, dropped out last, was out distanced nearing the stretch but walked off the course under his own power. FALLEN EMPIRE WAS
FRACTIOUS IN THE GATE, NECESSITATING A LATE SCRATCH.

Footnotes
FLY NIGHTLY, bumped at the start by MILBURN, was firmly rated between foes while angling inwards to track off the second flight racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance while angling out five wide in upper stretch and produced a stout rally to wrest a clear advantage in time under firm
encouragement. BEE BY THE SEA sped to the fore while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, held sway into the lane
while shifting a bit off the rail but was collared late. MILBURN broke out bumping the eventual winner a the start, angled quickly to the rail tracking just off
the leaders, saved ground to upper stretch, then advanced to challenge inside the top pair late but was outkicked. BEE MAJOR, urged to terms with the first
flight while caught three deep between foes racing into the first turn, shifted inwards to track the leaders outside a rival on the backstretch, shifted out four
wide racing into upper stretch while being urged to advance but lacked the needed final kick. BIG RED ROCKS, forwardly placed attending the pace in the
opening half, weakened between foes racing into the stretch. VINTNER, caught five wide while being prompted to terms with the leaders racing into the first
turn, tracked off the second flight outside foes to the far turn, was fanned six wide into the stretch and continued evenly late. ALLGORILLA settled outside
foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. BARREL OF STOUT was settled along the rail, saved ground throughout but
had no closing bid. ARMANDO'S TEAM settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch, swung out seven wide in upper stretch but failed to menace.
BUC'S INVESTMINT, caught four wide between foes while being prompted to contention racing into the first turn, retreated early.
