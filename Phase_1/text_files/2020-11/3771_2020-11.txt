BIG TREASURE stumbled at the start, settled off the pace inside, raced three wide in the clear behind a duel around the far turn, closed late and was up in
the final strides. KING ANDRES pressed the pace two wide, poked a head in front near the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled two wide to the sixteenth pole,
finally dispatched the pace rival then but was unable to hold off the winner late. BLOKE was bumped at the start, set the pace along the rail, vied to the
sixteenth pole and weakened. STARSHIP MUFASA was pinched back at the start and trailed inside.

Footnotes
DOMINEER moved through inside to take over from ROYAL MISTRESS after a sixteenth of a mile, widened the advantage around the turn, and was driving
to stay clear. BELLA GIANNA saved ground into the turn, had aim in the two-path outside DOMINEER past the three-sixteenths, but could not reach that
rival while clearly second best. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE got pinched back between BELLA GIANNA and DOMINEER at the start, began moving along the
rail after three furlongs, drifted out through deep stretch and was clear of the remainder. ROYAL MISTRESS led briefly before deferring to DOMINEER,
stayed on the chase into the turn, and faded approaching the stretch. GRAVEL GERTIE was no factor three wide.

Footnotes
ROYAL JEWEL pressed the pace two wide, reached near even terms approaching the quarter pole, dueled outside to the sixteenth pole and edged ahead
late. FLYING SOFIA sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of the winner, continued on the left lead in the lane and
gave way grudgingly. KATNISS KAN raced off the pace inside, swung out near the eighth pole and finished strongly. QUEEN ABARRIO stalked the pace
two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. CLASSY BEAST was bumped at the start, chased the pace three and four wide and lacked a closing bid.
DINNER AT FIVE saved ground to no avail. CAPELINE was outrun while racing three and four wide. DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB was bumped at the start,
raced two wide and never threatened. DEGREES OF FREEDOM had the rider lose the whip soon after the start and trailed throughout while racing well off
the rail.

SHINY EMPIRE set the pace inside, shook off VEGAS WEEKEND turning for home, and was kept busy to 70 yards out before coasting in. VEGAS
WEEKEND pressed SHINY EMPIRE from outside, could not stay with that one into the lane, continued on willingly and held the place. TAYLER'S CHROME
advanced two then three wide after a half-mile, could not get by VEGAS WEEKEND from outside through the late stages, and was much best of the rest.
GREY CHARLOTTE faded inside after a half. NAJWA tired approaching the stretch three wide. SECRET SARAH gave way abruptly on the turn, and jogged
in far behind.

FEAST set the pace in the two path and widened under a drive. TRINNI JOHN advanced along the rail around the turn, bid inside of the winner in upper
stretch, could not keep pace from the eighth pole, angled out near the sixteenth marker and was clearly second best late. HIMELSTEIN was shut off at the
start, saved ground off the pace, tipped out nearing the quarter pole and was along for the show. TONE FEELIN broke inwardly, chased the pace four wide,
continued on the left lead in the lane and came up empty. MOON MAN WALKING failed to menace while racing four wide. ZAMIT was outrun inside.
BISHTON had only brief speed three wide.

YES FACTOR vied outside CLASSY WOMAN early, moved clear up the backstretch, saved ground widening the advantage after six furlongs, and was kept
to pressure. CLASSY WOMAN contested the early pace inside YES FACTOR, was ridden along on the far turn to stay in range, brushed with STEFANIE
ON FLEEK through the stretch and stayed on to regain second inside that rival. STEFANIE ON FLEEK broke a step slow, chased three wide early, was
ridden along on the far turn to stay close, brushed with CLASSY WOMAN through a long drive and was edged for the runner-up spot. MOMENTS TO
SAVER saved ground to no avail. VUYELWA raced two to three wide throughout, and lacked the needed response.

wide around the far turn, took the lead turning for home, vied well outside of NACHO PAPA to the sixteenth marker and drove clear late. NACHO PAPA
stalked the pace three wide around the first turn, bid two wide into the far turn, took the lead nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied inside of the winner to the
sixteenth pole and settled for second best. TOTONO tracked the pace two wide, could not keep pace with the top two in the lane and bested the rest.

Footnotes
PROSPECT PROJECT bumped with MY CHITU at the start, moved up to challenge outside KID LEE and OPTIMISTIC with five-sixteenths remaining,
wrested command coming to the eighth-pole and drove clear. SWEET GIANT was outrun early three wide, moved inward approaching the stretch, came
back out and rallied willingly to go clear late for the place. KID LEE broke a step slow, rushed up to get the lead and moved inside going to the first turn,
came under attack from two challengers on the far turn, yielded to the winner in upper stretch and ran on to hold the show. MY CHITU bumped with
PROSPECT PROJECT at the start, lagged well back for six furlongs, swung four wide into the lane, and improved past tired horses. OPTIMISTIC steadied
while keyed up heading to the first turn, pressed KID LEE from outside, bid between horses after six furlongs, then gave way through the stretch. ALL
STARR RUNNER broke a step slow, went into the first turn four wide, moved in a bit staying in range for six furlongs, and tired. FUTURE PRINCE was
finished early inside.
