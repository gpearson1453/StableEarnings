Footnotes
SUPERSTITION away quickly to begin then chased the lone speed up the backstretch from inside, took aim two wide into the lane, drove past inside the
furlong pole and drew away. LILYPOP hard to load, sped clear and angled across to the inside, remained unchallenged into the drive, lost command inside
the eighth pole and lasted for the place. VEGAS PALM raced off the pace, saved ground around the turn, moved out a bit in the stretch, showed a mild late
effort and missed the place. IRISH AURA stalked the pace along the inside, moved out into the two path leaving the turn, drifted out in the stretch and went
evenly late. SHIZAAM (IRE) off slow to begin, trailed the field along the inside to the stretch and was never a factor. MARIE tracked outside a rival, two then
three wide on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
PUBILIUS SYRUS trailed the field through the early stages, angled out in upper stretch, finished with late rush and edged the runner-up in the final strides.
HONORING MAJOR chased between foes, two wide into the stretch, tipped out and rallied outside the top pair, led late but was outkicked by the winner.
CONQUEST COBRA dueled for the lead outside a rival, took a short lead at the five-sixteenths pole, battled with WILSHIRE DUDE in the lane, edged away
then outfinished by the top pair in deep stretch. WILSHIRE DUDE dueled for the lead from inside and weakened late. MOVE OVER (GB) stumbled leaving
the gate, stalked a bit off the rail inside a pair of rivals, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. NEW YEAR settled off the pace, came off the final
turn four wide and failed to threaten. CAMINO DE ESTRELLA forwardly placed three deep, traveled four wide into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
DEL MAR FLASH hopped at the start to come away last, split foes at the three-eighths pole, angled out in the final furlong, surged late and nailed foe in the
final moments. LITTLE LILIANA pressed the pace between foes early, battled outside through the lane, took control late but was edged by the winner.
SQUARED SHADY set the pace inside a pair of rivals, challenged at the quarter pole, held a short lead over LITTLE LILIANA through the lane and yielded
grudgingly late. AGATA in range of the speedy trio up the backstretch, entered the turn a bit off the rail, two wide into the stretch, finished willingly in the final
furlong but needed to find more. COCO'S JOY in range early while outside a rival, entered the turn two wide then angled four wide leaving the bend and
gained some ground in the late stages. PRINCESS SADIE showed early speed then dropped back leaving the backstretch, came off the turn three wide,
angled out in upper stretch and improved position. FLAG SALUTE attended the pace three deep, failed to match strides around the bend, chased three wide
into the lane and weakened. RACE JUDICATA dropped back off the pace early while urged upon, saved ground into the lane and was never a threat. MS
MICHELLE lacked early speed, entered the lane two wide and was never a factor. SIRCAT NELLY unhurried off the inside, went four wide into the stretch
and had little left.

KISS TODAY GOODBYE went four wide around the first turn, chased off the inside up the backstretch, ranged up four wide nearing the quarter pole,
collared rival past the eighth pole and drew clear. CANADIAN PRIDE up close early between runners then dropped back a bit into a stalking position,
challenged again between foes at the three-eights pole, took over at the five-sixteenths, briefly clear into the lane, fought with the winner in the lane and
proved no match in deep stretch. SECRET TOUCH raced off the inside, three wide into the stretch, moved out further in the lane and bested the rest. DARK
PRINCE set the pace under pressured, cleared at the half-mile pole, headed by a pair of rivals approaching the five-sixteenths pole, relinquished the lead at
the marker, chased inside leaving the turn and faded. OIL CAN KNIGHT settled off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and weakened. MYSTERY MAN
stumbled at the start, pressed the pace three deep then outside the leader, lost contact with the pacesetter at the half-mile pole, bid three deep at the
three-eighths pole but could not sustain the momentum into the stretch and tired. BLUE JAYS stumbled leaving the gate, raced two wide the moved out on
the backstretch, came four wide into the lane and never made an impact.

Footnotes
THANKS MR. EIDSON settled off the pace, went four wide into the lane, rallied and took command nearing the sixteenth pole and held in the final moments.
QUICK FINISH traveled off the pace outside a rival, raced four wide at the three-sixteenths pole, angled out in the lane, bumped by inside rival at the eighth
pole and rallied for the place. PSYCHO DAR vied between runners for the lead, took a short lead at the eighth pole, overtaken near the sixteenth pole and
stayed on for the show. ONE FLEW SOUTH showed early speed between foes then dropped back to stalk, entered the lane two wide and showed a mild
rally but was outkicked in the final furlong. PREACHING TRAINER traveled near the inside then angled three wide into the stretch, lacked room off heels
while between foes in upper stretch, shifted out near the eighth pole, bumped at the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. UNDENIABLE PROOF vied for the
lead from inside, fought back through the lane but flattened late. FLIP THE COIN JAN traveled three wide into the turn, moved into the two path then back
out again, came out into the stretch and failed to threaten. FACTORIAL broke well then stalked the top trio, went three to four wide around the turn, drifted
out and bumped foe near the eighth pole and could not regain momentum. MR. LOVEJOY vied outside a pair of rivals into and around the turn, lost contact
in upper stretch, bumped outside rival near the sixteenth pole and gave way.

Footnotes
ASTUTE set the pace outside a rival then dueled with foe into and around the turn, shook free in upper stretch and powered away in the final furlong.
QUEENGOL knocked into rival at the start then steadied shortly after, settled off the pace, went three wide around the turn and outside a rival into the lane,
grinded out the final furlong and edged rival for the place. HEELS UP away quickly then stalked the top pair, went three to four wide around the turn and
missed the place. PRIVATE MISSION pressed the pace then moved up to duel from inside, fought with the winner around the turn and into the lane, could
not match strides in upper stretch, shifted out at the eighth pole and flattened in the late stages. CANOODLING stumbled, bumped and steadied at the start,
traveled near the inside then two wide into the lane and weakened. MISS COSTA RICA broke in and bumped rival repeatedly at the start, chased off the
inside, four wide exiting the turn and tired.

MOVING FAST bumped with outside rival at the start, settled inside then moved into the two path, exited the far turn three wide, angled out in upper stretch
and edged past the top pair under a drive. BIG FLINT off slow and bumped at the start, raced off the rail, four wide into the lane, rallied and got up for
second. DISCRETIONARY DAY stalked outside a rival, closed in around the far turn, took aim three wide exiting the bend, headed rival at the eighth pole
while drifting inward, took a short lead near the sixteenth marker and caught in the closing moments. WARRENS CANDY MAN raced off the pace, traveled
two wide then tipped out in the lane and showed late effort to earn a minor award. BIG STORY dueled for the lead from inside, fought gamely through the
lane but yielded late. BLUE STAR tucked inside on the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, steered out in upper stretch and summoned a mild rally.
ALPINE THUNDER entered the clubhouse turn between foes then chased outside a rival, traveled three then four wide on the far turn and lacked a rally.
WHISKEY VISION stalked the pace from inside and could not rally. CLUB CAL took the first turn three wide, settled off the pace outside a rival, came three
wide into the lane and never made an impact. CIRCLEOFCHAMPIONS dueled for the lead outside a rival, vied between foes in uppers stretch, put in tight
quarters and steadied past the eighth pole, then gave way. CLUB CHAMP off a bit slow to begin, raced in the two path on the first turn, angled in and saved
ground around the second bend and was never a factor.
