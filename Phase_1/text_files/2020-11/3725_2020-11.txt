Footnotes
STRIKING SPEED shied in at the break under hustling and bumped UNRELENTING FORCE, dueled briefly before taking over sole command inside six
furlongs remaining and showed the way from the two path in hand, tucked inside through the turn and widened away under his own power, spun just off the
inside for home, dug in clear to the eighth pole, grew a bit weary in the final sixteenth when having his margin cut into but was along clear on the wire.
BLOOD MOON broke in at the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch, then three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung four wide for home, offered up a mild kick to be along clear of the rest and second best. TITAN'S WILL hustled from the gate, chased
three then two wide under urging from the half mile pole, spun just off the inside for home, kept on under a drive to secure the show honors. JOINT AND
SEVERAL six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for
home and tired. GRIT AND GLORY chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four wide for home and tired. UNRELENTING
FORCE got bumped at the start by STRIKING SPEED, who shied in at the break, dueled early on narrowly showing the way before being displaced on the
front, remained forwardly placed to the half mile pole, came under brief coaxing and retreated through the turn, went three to four wide into upper stretch
and was eased.

Footnotes
DREAM CHASING away alertly, went at it on near even terms with EXCITED FEELING from along the inside for most of the opening half, inched away from
that opponent as the second fraction was being finalized, settled in at the three-sixteenths marker and was given her cue, steadily kicked clear of the
competition, kept busy to the wire. BONUS BABY tracked the front runners from along the inside route, was eased to the outside heading for the
five-sixteenths pole, fanned out wider and wider for good racing clearance during the early stages of the stretch drive, straightened away and launched a
seven wide rally to be along for the place. ROSEY'S INVASION pocketed within striking distance of the contested pace, was under a drive spinning into the
two path for entrance into the stretch, got outfinished. HERE COMES MEG quickly spotted along the rail, cut the corner, came up empty. CEMETERY V I P
two to three wide on the turn, got sent out five wide exiting it, had no punch. SANDRA'S MINE kept an eye on pace dispute from just off the rail, swung out
into path four into the stretch, made no impact. RUNNING ON ENTRY along the outside throughout, took up the chase from the two path on the turn, shifted
into path six from upper to midlane, had no gain. GHOSTGHOSTGHOST in range racing two wide, got ridden slightly wider into the stretch, gave way.
STEPPIN' HAWK three wide onto the turn, was steered out six wide leaving it, failed to menace. DUSTINTHEWIND underwent a two wide journey, was
never involved. EXCITED FEELING sparred with the winner from path two for almost a half, faltered. VINITA sighted two wide at the top of the turn, was
never in it.

Footnotes
ROYAL FLAG settled tracking the front just off the inside near the rear of the compact field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, began to tip three wide
inside the five-sixteenths angling four wide into upper stretch, dug in under an off sided stick and shied slightly before being corrected rallying to tackle the
top pair and take command near the sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish kept to task. MRS. ORB just off the inside through the first turn, chased
three then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths advancing to knock heads with NONNA MADELINE from the five-sixteenths through the stretch,
spun three wide for home, dueled through the length of the drive until overhauled by the top one near the sixteenth pole, then ran on to safely secure the
place honors. NONNA MADELINE saved ground through the first turn before chasing two then three wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced under
coaxing from the three-eighths to take command nearing the five-sixteenths, dueled with the aforementioned foe from that station through to the sixteenth
marker when displaced from command, then kept on for the show honors, well clear of the rest. ANOTHER BROAD tossed her head slightly at the start,
tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. GRACEFUL
PRINCESS coaxed from the gate, showed the way three then two wide through the first turn before settling in hand along the inside, came under coaxing
under pressure for the initial time three furlongs out, got displaced inside that station, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
WINTERS BACK established the top in short order, was in control sailing along on the inside route, got called upon for more coming up to the
three-sixteenths marker, gave the desired response and kicked away. BAY STREET MONEY pursued the winner two to three wide, was more the latter
heading onto the top of the lane, proved no match. JOHNNYPUMP tracked the pacesetter from along the inside route for three-quarters, tipped two wide
entering the stretch, narrowed in to be up for the show. EXULT chased the pace towards path two, angled four wide for the drive home, flattened out.
CLEMENZA raced primarily from the two path to the end of the bend, shifted out into path five from upper to midstretch, mustered up a mild response.
ETHOS pocketed, pulled on the bit during the opening phases, cut the corner into the stretch and faltered. MAKOTO stalked the top one from the two path,
was let out a notch in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, went into the stretch and backed away. VRIODINI sluggish and along the inside, failed to
contend.

CHAYSENBRYN four wide in aim of the leader down the backstretch, advanced three to four wide through the turn pressing the pace from outside a pair,
swung three wide into upper stretch, took over command at the three-sixteenths and went clear under a drive to prevail. PRINCESS IN CHARGE
established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home and came under increasing
pressure from a pair to the outside getting placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, yielded the front at the three-sixteenths,
weakened in the late stages while along well clear of the rest and along second best. TRIPP ROAD stumbled at the start, prompted the pace three then two
wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home and weakened. SHE'S A LUMBERJANE chased three to four wide down
the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and passed tired rivals. HAYEZHEE
brushed at the start by WILD NORTH due to pressure from MANI PEDI, chased three then two wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide
for home and tired. MANI PEDI bobbled at the break recovering outwards and bumping WILD NORTH into HAYEZHEE, chased just off the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired. SYZYGY chased two to three wide until tipped out to the five path five furlongs from
home, tucked three wide through the turn, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired. POSITIVE SKEW chased along the inside down the
backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. WILD
NORTH bumped at the start by MANI PEDI who recovered outwards from a bobble, showed brief speed just off the inside, retreated near the half mile pole,
got eased midway on the turn angling out, then completed the course under a walk to the finish before being walked off.

Footnotes
CARAMOCHA away well, quickly established the top, pulled a bit leading the field towards the two path on the backstretch, slid over closer to the rail in time
for the beginning of the run around the bend, struck the three-sixteenths marker and got switched over to stronger handling, edged away, stubbornly
venturing onward on the wrong lead. SUMMER BREW forwardly placed along the rail, was ridden three wide into the lane, proved no match. JAMAICA JOY
stalked the winner from path two, drifted about a couple paths farther off the rail onto the top of the lane, faltered. OUT FIRST kept watch on the top one
while saving ground, was already under a drive prior to the quarter pole, cut the corner into the stretch, made no headway. CHILLY CHOOS two wide on the
turn, tired after going a half. PHOTOFINISH JEANNE strung out three wide at the midway point on the turn, swung out five into path five entering the
stretch, altered back into the three path shortly afterwards, made no impact. STORMI CAT LADY gathered after breaking to the outside, raced four wide on
the turn, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, never made her presence felt. TEETOTALER came in after losing her footing springing from the
starting gate, darted over to the rail, rode it until the end of the bend, got spotted into path two at the head of the stretch, had no offering. PONCHO SONG
away last after bobbling out at the start, rode the rail for nearly a half, went three wide into the stretch, failed to menace. TWELVE TOES three wide onto the
turn, angled five wide exiting it, gave out.

Footnotes
MR. FIDGET broke out at the start brushing FUSILLI, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn
coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled seven wide into upper stretch, closed well brushing with HAVE A HEART as that foe came out
nearing the sixteenth marker and was up in the very last stride to the finish to score. POSSE CAN DISCO broke in at the start bumping RINGGOOD, came
under coaxing and pressed the leader from the outside in the four path, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
spun three wide for home, inched away to the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat and was nailed on the wire. HAVE A HEART three wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, closed well in tandem with the eventual winner to his outside coming
out and brushing that rival near the sixteenth marker and missed at the finish while clear for the show honors. BRICKYARD chased two to three wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. RIVER NILE broke out at the start bumping
RINGGOOD, came under hustling and showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from POSSE CAN DISCO to the outside, tucked inside
through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got headed for command at the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, weakened in
the late stages. TALESPIN chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired
rivals. RINGGOOD got bumped at the start by POSSE CAN DISCO breaking inwards then got bumped by RIVER NILE breaking outwards, chased five
paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, cornered two to three wide into upper
stretch and offered no response. EMPIRE EXPRESS four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under a
ride at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide for home and weakened. FUSILLI got bumped at the start by MR. FIDGET, who broke outwards, chased
five paths off the inside down the backstretch in aim of the leader, tucked three wide through the turn stacked outside the top pair coaxed along from the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. LIQUOR five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the
turn under a ride from midway, continued four wide for home and weakened. NEVER HOLD BACK chased two to three wide until tucked inside half a mile
from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. Following a shoe repair in the paddock, MIGHTY
WIND chased inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued along the rail into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ILLEGAL SMILE (IRE) away in good order, grabbed the advantage shortly after the field had been sent off and running, cut over to the inside, showed the
way well rated, accompanied by a firmly-held MAGICAL SOUL out in the two path, got turned loose approaching the three-sixteenths maker, came under
aim from HONEY PANTS the rest of the way home, dug in to prevail. HONEY PANTS tracked the winner from the pocket, was called upon more tipping to
the outside as the second split was about to be posted, got engaged with the winner from path two, fought on willingly but was denied. LEXINATOR
underwent a ground-saving journey, stepped into the stretch and narrowed in for the show. SHOW ME THE HONEY settled along the inside route,
abandoned it in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths marker, was gradually maneuvered into path four during the stretch run, made no headway en route for the
last major check. MAGISTERIUM (IRE) slow to settle, was along the rail by the top of the turn, cut the corner and went on to mostly improve position.
HERALD ANGEL took up the chase three wide on the turn, gave way. SPIRITED BEAUTY three wide onto the turn, was fanned out into path six backing
away down the stretch. MAGICAL SOUL prompted the winner from path two for the opening half, was pull off SHOW ME THE HONEY in retreat in upper
stretch.

SHARP STARR hustled from the gate, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch in close aim of the leader, tucked three wide through the turn,
took over command nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, went clear under a drive to inside the eighth pole, then got ridden out to
the finish. BLITCHTON LADY showed the way from the six path in hand under pressure from a trio, tucked to the two path into the turn shaking off two of
her prompters and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenth confronted by the top one, got displaced from command and spun just off the inside for home,
weakened in the stretch while along for the place honors. COURAGEOUS GIRL prompted the pace five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then
chased three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. LOTTIE'S MIZZION broke out
brushing the off side stall at the start, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, continued to take the inside route into upper stretch and tired. IFIHADACHANCE seven to eight paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. PRINCESS PINKY got steadied at the
start when CHEATHAM HILL broke outwards in front, chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled six wide for home and tired.
CHEATHAM HILL broke out at the start forcing the aforementioned foe to steady in behind, chased four wide forwardly placed down the backstretch, tucked
to the two path through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. DUBLINORNOTHIN showed speed
three wide down the backstretch for the opening half mile, tucked inside at that station, came under coaxing in retreat at the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and folded. KINKY SOX five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coaxed along from
three furlongs out, cornered four wide for home and made no impact.

Footnotes
ROBIN SPARKLES advanced along the hedge to assume the top shortly after the field had been released, showed the way, feeling some pressure from the
second place finisher out in the two path, spun onto the head of the stretch, had already extended its lead to its largest margin when called upon for more
deep into the furlong grounds, felt the presence of a pair of rivals in the final stages, dug in late to preserve the decision. ABUSE OF POWER pressed the
pace from path two, got roused for the drive home, came out two to three paths under steady left side pressure in the final furlong, moving momentarily onto
the path of FETCHING inside the sixteenth pole, continued to chip away at the deficit but was staved off. FETCHING got set up along the inside route
midway on the backstretch, bided her time, angled three wide coming into the stretch, closed in, shied out towards the middle of the course leaving the
eighth pole, reacting to the wayward ways of ABUSE OF POWER, steadied when caught in close proximity to that foe's heels for a stride with under a
sixteenth to go, recovered and ventured on to be the third to cross the finish line. UPLIFTED pursued the pace from the two path, waited behind a few as the
half was being completed, got steered out five wide from upper to midstretch, made no headway. FIONNBHARR loped at the back of the pack during the
initial stages after being pinched at the start, cut over to the rail, went on to save ground to no avail. SARATOGA LOVE taken hold of after breaking slightly
to the outside, tracked the pace from the pocket, slithered its way into the two path at the head of the stretch, faltered. PURE WOW chased the pace two to
three wide from midpack, got sent out into path six during the stretch drive, backed away. WICKED AMBER departed the backstretch from path three, was
through after the half had been run, wandered seven wide down the stretch in retreat. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on ABUSE OF POWER and
FETCHING in deep stretch, the former was disqualified from second and placed third for having caused interference.
