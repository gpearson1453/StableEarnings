Footnotes
SAVE THE STORY sent from between foes to gain lead early, set pressured pace into and on the turn while coming in some, edged away in upper stretch
and safely held under steady handling. STYLISH IN RED was bit hard to load, broke well and was close up early from the outside, angled over nearing the
bend, forced the issue outside the winner around the bend, lost contact in upper stretch and finished willingly. IT'S A RIDDLE between foes early then
stalked on two wide path, angled three wide leaving the bend and was clearly next best. KEEP IT CLASSY settled inside, hugged the rail throughout and
passed tiring foes in the drive to improve placing. OUR BONNIE LASS bobbled at the start, settled off the pace, chased three wide on the turn, shifted out
five wide into the stretch and did not menace. SHE'S A LADY GRIZ tracked the leaders from off the rail then three wide around the turn, raced four wide into
the stretch and came in slightly later. OUR ROMANCE forwardly placed early from off the rail, raced outside foe on the turn then between rivals and
weakened. MAGICAL SMILE settled outside, traveled four then three wide into the bend, remained off the fence and lacked needed response. MISTY AT
THE TOP was squeezed some leaving the gate, raced off the rail early, dropped back some into and early on the turn and also failed to threaten. LA
DOLFINA was slow into stride, chased from the inside, saved ground to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
LIFE IS GOOD broke alertly, steadied slightly leaving the chute and quickly sped clear, carved out sizzling fractions while slightly off the rail, padded that
cushion on two wide path into the lane and made an auspicious debut while ridden out to the wire. WIPE THE SLATE settled off the pacesetter, angled over
early, raced along the rail thereafter and was along for the place. SANTOS TO WILSON came in some early and was closest pursuer to pacesetter,
followed winner's path into the stretch but could not match inside rival in the final furlong for runner-up honors. ROMAN CENTURIAN reserved from the
inside, saved ground to the stretch, came out some and missed third while outside rival. SCALES OF JUSTICE lagged back early and weakened in the
stretch.

Footnotes
ROSES AND CANDY tucked in behind leaders, saved ground around the turn, lacked room along the rail in upper stretch, finally tipped out passing
sixteenth marker, found clear seam and surged late to get up from between rivals in the final jump. ACAI flashed keen early foot, set pace from the inside,
inched away on the turn, held slight advantage from inside in the drive, dug in late but was nailed on the wire. CLARO QUE SI was slow into stride, chased
two then three wide into the stretch, came out further in upper stretch, closed strongly from the outside but lost narrow decision while three abreast at the
finish. BRITTLE AND YOO forced the early pace from between foes, continued prominently into the stretch and between rivals but gave ground in final
sixteenth. FLORENTINE DIAMOND reserved from off the rail, raced three wide into the bend, came in slightly around the turn and failed to offer any late
response. MARIAH GIRL (ARG) close up early, traveled three wide into and around the turn, was three deep in upper stretch and weakened. FLAT OUT
JOY was off slow, chased from the inside, later came off the rai slightly and failed to menace. DAIRY KID was outside winner early, chased three then four
wide to the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
PAIGE RUNNER stepped to the front into initial turn, controlled pace while well in hand, padded cushion around the second turn and clearly proved best
under steady handling and few taps of the whip in the lane. BORN TO REIGN settled inside, moved up some from along the rail to the second turn, moved
into second while inside HIT IT TWICE around the final bend and comfortably held the place. BOONESBORO BEAUTY outside rival chasing the early pace,
angled out three wide on the second bend, came five wide into the stretch and cleared late to gain show honors. HIT IT TWICE three wide early, moved up
to force the pace outside winner, lost contact with that rival around the second bend and weakened. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY caught five wide into first turn,
stalked from the outside and four wide to the second bend, remained well off the rail and weakened. FREE MY SOUL four wide into first turn and between
foes, stalked three wide on the backstretch, remained bid wide and lacked any late response. FRUITFULLY reserved along the rail, chased inside
throughout and was no late threat. SHOE GAME bobbled slightly leaving the gate, raced outside runner-up early, between rivals on the second turn,
dropped back in upper stretch and was eased later in the lane.

Footnotes
MASTER RYAN dueled from the inside into the bend, remained along the rail, shook free in upper stretch and safely held under strong handling. FAT
STACKS stalked dueling pair from the inside early, remained along the fence around the turn and into the lane, came out slightly through the drive and went
willingly to the wire. QUEEN'S CODE chased from off the rail then three wide, angled five wide leaving the turn, battled outside rival through the lane and
won the battle for third. ZERO DOWN was off a step slow, raced two wide early, came out bit on the turn, was three wide and between rivals entering the
stretch, dueled inside rival through the stretch and lost the decision for the show. VERRY BOSSY unhurried while taken off the rail early, raced on two path
to the stretch, came out bit in upper stretch and did not menace. CRANKIN steadied off heels of SHIMMER ME TIMBERS early, raced outside rival into
bend, was fanned four then five wide around the turn and into the stretch and lacked late response. DYNAMIC DUO chased from the inside, remained along
the fence to the stretch then drifted out some in final furlong. BATTLING GERVINHO dueled outside winner into and on the turn, dropped back into the lane
and in upper stretch, came in some and weakened from the inside.

Footnotes
JOE DON LOONEY broke alertly then taken just off the pace, stalked from outside leader, advanced around the turn, reached front a furlong out and edged
away late under right handed urging and shown the stick late. CRASH CORRIGAN settled outside, advanced three then four wide around the bend,
remained well off the rail, closed late despite being on wrong lead and got up in final jump for second. SHIMMER ME TIMBERS sped to the front early, set
pace from the inside, remained on the rail into the stretch, was overtaken passing eighth marker then lost the place on the wire. BIG WELL stalked while bit
off the rail, raced on two wide path to the stretch, later secured the rail and weakened. DETECTIVE BERNARDO was close up early and bit off the fence,
tracked pace on two wide path, dropped back in upper stretch and also weakened. CARELESS KITTEN bumped with inside rival leaving the gate, reserved
inside, came out some entering the stretch and did not threaten. MY CHILD SBUD between rivals early, continued two wide to the bend, came out further
exiting the bend and failed to reach contention. BIG ENDEAVOR bumped with outside foe at the start, reserved along the rail, saved ground throughout and
was no late factor.

front, set pressured pace from the inside, resisted when challenged late on last turn, fought back from the inside through the lane and lost narrow decision.
TIME TO TESTIFY chased outside foe, continued three then four around around the final turn and finished willingly. WAYNE O off bit slow then rushed up to
attend early pace outside leader, forced issue to second bend, bid later on that turn, between rivals into the lane but weakened later in the drive. GOALIE
exchanged bumps with outside rival shortly after the break then had to be straighten away to avoid inside rail, chased along the rail, remained inside into the
stretch and failed to threaten late. I'M LEAVING YOU bumped with inside rival in initial strides, settled inside, also saved ground to second turn, angled
three wide into the lane and lacked needed late punch. DEFENSE WINS stalked from along the fence, also saved ground into the stretch and weakened.
