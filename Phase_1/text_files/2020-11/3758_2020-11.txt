Footnotes
AMIGO'S AFFAIR stumbled slightly at the start and quickly recovered, drew clear at the quarter pole with a quick move, widened late under steady handling.
SQUEEGEE was hard used early to keep up, rallied on the inside and was up for place. REBEL ROAD raced mid pack early, rallied in mid stretch, hung
late. SALT MINE was allowed to settle and failed to menace. EMPTY PRIZE pressed inside and had no rally. CIELO LINDO dueled early and was through
after a half. ZA WOODMAN raced wide and was no menace. YO BERBS had brief foot, and was through early. SMILING MASON flashed brief foot, and
gave way quickly.
