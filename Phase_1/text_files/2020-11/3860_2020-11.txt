the winner in the late stages. NESSUM DORMA trailed the field early on, was off the rail into the lane with a mild gain in the stretch run. LUCKY BE A LADY
stalked the pace early, made a bid while three wide from the five sixteenths pole to the stretch but weakened late in the stretch drive. I DREAM OF LOIS set

EASY TO BLESS dueled for the lead outside of JUST LIFE, assumed command passing the quarter pole, and drew off under driving pressure before being
wrapped up approaching the wire. JUST LIFE dueled for the lead inside of EASY TO BLESS, but proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, then chased
her well to stay well clear of show. SHIRLEYTHESHOPPER pressed the dueling leaders from the outside while staying a path away from them, inched
closer to bid at the five sixteenths pole, but was repelled by inner foes passing the quarter pole, then tired through the late stages, and just held show. MISS
MAGDALENA advanced from off of the pace in the two path around the turn, tipped to the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on through the late stages,
but just missed reaching show. FILLMORE EAST raced far off of the pace two wide around the turn, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and improved
past tiring foes. COUGER was off awkwardly, came under urging to keep pace early on while far back along the inside, then saved ground around the turn
before improving in the late without threatening. TIZ A BIT LUCKY broke outwardly, took the turn in the six path while far off of the pace, then lugged in in
upper stretch and failed to mount a rally. SPRINGFIELD DUSTY stalked along the inside, came off of the rail turning for home, but weakened through the
lane. PASSIONATE HEART saved ground around the turn in midpack, but to no avail. GOODY TWO SIOUX lied forwardly placed four wide early on, but
faded in the five path around the turn. FOUND MY MAN was outrun and showed little.

Footnotes
JALEN JOURNEY vied for the lead outside of BOYFRIEND MATERIAL while being kept in the three path around the turn by that foe, forged an advantage
from that rival in upper stretch, then drew off through the final furlong under driving pressure. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL set a pressured pace along the
inside, but was headed by his pressing counterpart in upper stretch, yielded to that foe at the furlong pole, and held place thereafter. MOONOVERSEBA
stalked along the inside, but lacked a kick to bid inside of the leaders in upper stretch, altered out when that opening shut passing the three sixteenths pole,
bumped THOMAS SHELBY approaching the furlong pole, then chased the leaders from inside of that rival through the late stages. THOMAS SHELBY
stalked two wide and between horses, but chased the leaders through upper stretch without making progress, then was bumped by an inner foe
approaching the furlong pole, and failed to produce a bid. RULER OF THE NILE advanced to stalking position outside of the pair of leaders into the turn,
tracked those foes from the four path before inching closer turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch. LITTLE KANSAS bumped with an outer foe
at the start, trailed the field in the three path around the turn before swinging to the five path at the quarter pole, but lacked a rally.

ROCK STAR PARKING stalked along the inside, tracked from the pocket while in the two path around the turn, committed to a rail rally passing the quarter
pole as PATTY H created ample racing room, then sustained a rally to produce a bid inside of the leader passing the furlong pole, and prevailed under a
long drive. HYBRID ECLIPSE dueled for the lead two wide, forged an advantage passing the quarter pole while in the three path and between horses, dug
in passing the furlong pole as ROCK STAR PARKING menaced along the rail, but flopped back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole, and got bested
approaching the wire. ZAPPORITA stalked two wide, then from the three path around the turn before producing a bid in the four path at the quarter pole,
vied with inner foes through midstretch, but was repelled by those rivals approaching the sixteenth pole. ASPROPODIA was urged along off of the pace
along the inside, took the turn in the two path before shifting to the five path in upper stretch, and improved. GENERAL GINNY took the turn in the three to
four path while off of the pace, shifted in after PATTY H drifted in front of her path in the final furlong, and failed to menace. PATTY H dueled along the
inside while about a path off of the inner railing, but was headed by outer foes passing the quarter pole, gave way at the three sixteenths pole, and drifted
out while weakening through the final furlong. J D'S VISTA was off slowly, raced far off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and failed to make an
impact. TAPTIME tracked from midpack along the inside, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole, and was done early. TONE MY BETTY hesitated
at the start, and was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
ROYAL DAAHER tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, tugged under a tight hold into the turn, tipped four wide at the quarter pole, rallied
through the lane to bid at the sixteenth pole, and drove past the leader approaching the wire. AMERICAN MANDATE prompted the pace two wide, vied
around the turn before forging an advantage at the quarter pole, cleared through midstretch, but drifted outwards after being confronted by ROYAL
DAAHER approaching the sixteenth pole, and was bested by that foe approaching the wire. CHIEF HOWCOME set the pace along the inside, vied inside of
the eventual winner around the turn before being headed by that foe approaching the quarter pole, gave way to that foe in upper stretch, and just held show
to the wire. TWILIGHT FANTASY stalked three wide, then from between horses passing the quarter pole, but was outkicked by an outer foe in upper
stretch, then chased the leaders home, and just failed to reach show. VERB stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid before fading. AMANI'S
KITTEN tracked from off of the pace in the four path around the turn, but was fanned to the five path at the quarter pole, and tired. EQUAL JUSTICE raced
off of the pace along the inside early on, then trailed around the turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
LADY MCKENZIE set the pace, built a clear margin in hand into the far turn, dug in inside of the bidding STRELLA'S WAR at the quarter pole, and gamely
repelled that foe at the sixteenth marker. STRELLA'S WAR saved ground from midpack, advanced inside of foes around the far turn before bidding outside
of the leader turning for home, vied through midstretch, but was turned back at the sixteenth pole. DOUBLE OAKED saved ground around both turns while
far off of the pace, and improved through the lane. TWELVE MONARCHS raced off of the pace three wide, and stayed on for a minor share. DIXIE MOLL
stalked two wide and between horses, but tired through the lane. SHE WANTS MORE hopped at the start and was off slowly, then raced off of the pace two
wide and between horses, and failed to factor. B SKY HIGH lied forwardly placed four wide, but weakened around the far turn. DECORATED FOR GOLD
lied forwardly placed three wide and between horses, but weakened in upper stretch.
