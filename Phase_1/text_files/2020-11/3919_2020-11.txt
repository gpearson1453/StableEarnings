Footnotes
GOODLUCKCHUCK , four to five wide outside rivals and chasing the pace, closed steadily under right handed encouragement, took command in deep
stretch and went clear at the wire. TO THE FRONT , bumped at the break, sped clear early and set a rated pace, thwarted a challenge while two wide into
the lane, spurted away under a drive in mid stretch, failed to contain the winner then managed to just save the place. THE WALK bobbled slightly at the
break and bumped with TO THE FRONT, pulled his way forward while saving ground past the five eighths, tracked patiently mid turn, eased out for room in
the final sixteenth and rallied between runners. BACKWOODS BOOGIE stalked the pace three to four wide and between rivals, was under pressure with
aim into the lane but lacked a serious finish. HOLY SAINT eased out early and stalked two to three wide, was under a hearty ride mid turn, briefly
threatened entering the lane, failed to quicken past the three sixteenths and weakened. THE QUANTICO KID broke a step slow, settled off the pace while
racing in the clear, was under urging three wide into the stretch but failed to rally. OUTSIDE THE BOX drafted back off the pace, saved ground mid turn,
was under asking past the quarter pole but had no response.

Footnotes
UNEQUIVOCAL , off a bit slow when brushed, recovered and pulled his way forward between rivals to reach a stalking spot, rated kindly mid turn, eased out
three wide and went on the attack into the lane, responded when roused inside the three sixteenths, secured command a bit later, kicked clear then held
firm under steady pressure. THE FORTY FACTOR vied outside a rival, took command in hand leaving the far turn, went clear mid turn, dug in when collared
heading to mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. TAKE YOUR PLACE , brushed at the start, saved ground while within range into the turn, awaited some
room mid turn, eased out and knifed his way between rivals into the stretch, shifted in a bit but failed to muster up a strong run. DAYSTRIKE , four wide
outside rivals, moved up a bit into the lane, chased in mid stretch but flattened out late. QUICK MAN , off the pace while off the inside, swung five wide and
made a slight run into the stretch but failed to seriously sustain. IWISHIWASPECIAL , brushed and in a bit tight soon after the break, lagged off the pace,
swung five wide into the lane but lacked a rally. PEP TALKING was urged to a short early lead, set a pressured pace towards the inside, could not keep
pace past the five sixteenths and weakened. NOTABLE chased three wide and faltered after a half mile.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY COOL saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, shut off TWITTY CITY when bearing out entering the stretch, closed outside horses and
was up late. LITTLE LION sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, opened a clear lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. TWITTY
CITY , three wide between horses on the turn, steadied when impeded turning for home then rallied outside foes. BRIBERY circled the turn three wide,
moved to the two path at the head of the stretch and weakened in the drive. SILVER SUN , briefly steadied in traffic leaving the turn, angled to the five path
entering the stretch and failed to menace. JUST NOD AND SMILE , four wide on the turn, weakened. NATTY BEAU prompted the pace outside LITTLE
LION and faltered entering the stretch. Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of TWITTY CITY, KENTUCKY COOL was disqualified and
placed third.

Footnotes
FEDERALE had speed and contested the early pace outside of ROBBER BOB, saw that one go clear leaving the three eighths but remained under some
rating, came under coaxing with a quarter to go, kept on under pressure and came back to earn a narrow decision between rivals. COOKE BROTHERS
lagged off the pace, commenced a run while saving ground past the three eighths, continued inside progress to the three sixteenths, angled ou to split
rivals, worked further out in the final seventy yards and finished gamely to just miss. ROBBER BOB dueled inside and gained a short lead heading to the
turn, shook clear mid turn, remained clear under a drive past the furlong grounds but just couldn't quite hold on. VICTORY GIVEN , bumped at the break,
was well placed stalking a contested early pace, ranged up four wide to have dead aim into the lane, failed to follow through and faded in the final sixteenth.
SAVE ME PAULA , off the pace, raced three wide into the lane but failed to menace. BRET'S LEGACY angled in leaving the far turn while stalking the pace,
took closer order along the rail heading into the lane, chased then gave way a sixteenth out. IRISHTOWN , bumped and pinched back at the break, was
rated well wide and well off the pace and never made an impact. SOUTHERN SEA , bumped at the break, raced four wide into the stretch and weakened.

CLOSER LOOK , reluctant to load into the starting gate, stalked the pace racing near the rail, moved up in the two path leaving the far turn, secured
command in upper stretch and was kept to his business in the drive. BENANDJOE saved ground on the far turn and rallied. MARKET MOVER , angled to
the five path in upper stretch, flattened out. PAUL THE WAITER lacked speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and offered a mild gain.
THREETHEHARDWAY chased the pace two wide and gave way leaving the far turn. MAYBE SOMEDAY set the pace along the inner rail and faltered after
seven furlongs.

Footnotes
AWESOME PAL rated close up while saving ground, steadied briefly past the five eighths, recovered and waited patiently mid turn, got through along the
inside leaving the three sixteenths, rallied under left handed pressure, took command a sixteenth out and went clear at the wire. CAIRO QUEEN broke a
step slow, edged up between runners early on and tracked the pace, bid three wide to draw alongside the leader into the lane, sparred past the furlong
grounds, kept on willingly and was clear of the rest. LE PETITE PAPILLON broke on top and set the pace towards the rail, was guided out a bit and set
down once collared past the quarter pole, dueled to the inside of CAIRO QUEEN from the three sixteenths past mid stretch then faded in the final seventy
yards. PERSIAN QUEEN was shuffled back nearing the turn, dropped in and lacked a solid run. TWEET AWAY ROBIN prompted the pace four wide, bid
outside rivals nearing the lane, failed to keep pace heading to the eighth pole and faded. FED POLICY , in range while off the inside, angled four to five wide
approaching the stretch but failed to respond.
