Footnotes
JADEY AT THE BAR led inside along the backstretch, entered turn along the rail and briefly headed late in the turn by outside rival, battled back gamely and
held off rivals well. DABZILLA steadied back at the start when inside rival came out, chased under snug hold along the inside and stayed inside until the
stretch, angled out and rallied well to be second best. COLOUR OF MONEY pressed leader two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and made
strong bid for lead late in the turn, headed leader briefly and lacked needed kick in deep stretch and faded late to third. THECHAMPISFLORING came out
and bumped rival at the start, stalked leader two wide, and entered turn three wide, into the stretch in the four path and bested rest. IN IT FOR LIFE chased
leader three wide on the backstretch, entered turn three wide and lacked any rally in the stretch. GODDESS APHRODITE settled along the inside
throughout and never threatened while along the rail in the stretch.
