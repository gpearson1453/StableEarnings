Footnotes
FROZEN FUNDS broke slowly, shifted out advancing into the stretch, caught GENERIC JOE from outside with 70 yards to go and edged away. GENERIC
JOE (IRE) sat behind the leaders awaiting an opening on the turn, was guided out for clearance into the stretch, overtook FORTY FLASH coming to the
eighth-pole, but could not hold off the top one. MINDSHIP Q saved ground outsprinted to the stretch, moved out a couple paths and finished willingly. MY
MAXAMILLION raced three wide around the turn, moved in a path into the stretch, and lacked a solid response. FORTY FLASH dueled outside VALEROSO
early, got the best of that dispute on the turn, then was overhauled by GENERIC JOE through the furlong grounds and faded. VALEROSO dueled early
inside FORTY FLASH, and gave way on the turn. YOUNG THOMAS was no factor four wide. LITTLE STORM GODS saved ground to no avail. LOST
LOVER tracked outside the early leaders three wide, and was finished turning for home. MAYOR REMO stayed in range three wide early, and dropped back
through the lane. The half-mile fraction was hand timed.

LET'S BE HONEST stalked the pace two wide, seized command leaving the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. SENSE A MILLION stalked the
pace from the rail early, angled three wide nearing the five-sixteenths marker, chased the winner outside through the lane and was clearly second best.
TREVESS set a clear pace along the rail, was collared near the five-sixteenths pole and weakened while holding third. TALE OF V K saved ground off the
pace and lacked the needed rally. TALKTHETALK raced off the pace outside, made some progress under urging while racing three and four wide around
the turn but came up empty in the lane. BLESSED BEAST steadied early, raced two wide and made little impact. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA played no
factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
HONORABLE pressed ANDRES EDUARDO from outside, took over around the far turn, and drove clear staying on his left lead. EXPONENTIAL saved
ground in the second flight for nearly six furlongs, moved out approaching the stretch and rallied mildly. EL AFORTUNADO bumped solidly with HARD
GAME at the start, raced two to three wide well back to the stretch, and offered a mild response to pick up a share. MISTA DONZELLA raced three wide
much of the way, and lacked a closing bid. RAULITO raced forwardly inside for six furlongs, and had no rally. ANDRES EDUARDO set the early pace
hounded by HONORABLE, came under heavy pressure unable to hold that foe off midway on the far turn, and faded through the final furlong. HARD GAME
was bumped solidly from both sides at the start, steadied through the stretch the first time at the back, and never got close. YOUNG FLINT buckled after
slamming into HARD GAME at the break, advanced mildly after six furlongs, then gave way. MISTER FERNANDO raced four wide around the first turn, and
was through soon after completing a half-mile.

Footnotes
LIGHTS ON GIRL was bumped at the start then steadied off heels soon after, advanced three wide around the turn, closed steadily while merely shown the
whip and was up and clear late. SIERRA DIAMOND broke out and bumped the winner at the start, quickly recovered to show speed inside down the
backstretch, eased back around the turn, angled two wide nearing the quarter pole, re-bid outside of FIFTH ILLUSION in upper stretch, continued on the left
lead, battled to deep stretch and won that duel while swallowed up by the winner in the late yards. FIFTH ILLUSION set the pace two wide, cleared midway
around the turn, vied inside to deep stretch and was outfinished. V K PRINCESS saved ground off the pace, hit the rail entering the turn, remained inside
throughout and had a mild rally. BACKSTORY was fractious and loose pre-race, chased the pace two wide and lacked a rally. JADA'S KINGDOM was
outrun while racing four wide. GLOBAL QUEEN COCO played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
MISS JEN advanced three then four wide approaching the quarter-pole, had aim outside the leaders through the furlong grounds, and finished determinedly
to get up late. LA INCONDICIONAL led through the stretch the first time, got eased back to let VUYELWA and VINYARDNINA go on with it around the first
turn, tracked from close range up the backstretch, waited for room in the two-path around the far turn, opted for a rail bid and reached a short lead a
sixteenth out, but was nailed in the closing strides. SASSY JUSTICE raced close up three wide early, took over from outside after six furlongs, stayed on
through the furlong grounds and was outkicked from there. CATNIP KITTEN was outrun early, swung four wide coming off the far turn, and gained late
without seriously menacing. QUEEN FIELD ranged up to challenge for command three wide on the far turn, but could not sustain the rally and flattened out
in mid stretch. ITS ABOUT ME checked along the inside heading into the first turn, and failed to threaten. SUBTLE JOY was never prominent. SWEET
STORY reared at the start spotting the field eight lengths or so, and never recovered. VUYELWA vied for command inside VINYARDNINA early, and was
finished before reaching the stretch. VINYARDNINA contested the pace outside VUYELWA, and faltered after six furlongs. THERE WAS A STEWARDS
INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

under a drive. OLD MAIN settled off the pace while racing two wide, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied to gain second in deep stretch. LORD

backstretch and around the far turn and weakened in the drive. MAJORITY RULES saved ground well back and passed tiring rivals. SOLE SEEKER saved
ground and failed to menace. VOICESINTHEDARKNEZ never threatened while racing five wide around the first turn and four wide rounding the far turn.
SKYLINE VIEW was bumped after the start and played no further factor while racing three and four wide. IMPERIAL GREATNESS had early speed four
wide and was through after a half. MOON MAN WALKING was bumped after the start, had brief speed three wide and was easing through the lane.

Footnotes
DISTINCTLY BLUE stayed in range two wide around the turn, rallied along the rail through the stretch, and was just up inside HEIR BALL. The latter set a
pressured pace inside FOLLOW ME MOM, edged away in the two-path with a furlong remaining, but could not withstand the winner. WAR STAR raced four
wide in striking range to the stretch, and finished gamely outside the top two. FOLLOW ME MOM contested the pace outside HEIR BALL to the stretch, and
weakened. TRUE HEIRESS lacked the needed response two wide. REAL DOOZIE was no factor inside. BRIGHT VENEZUELAN made no headway four
wide around the turn. TAYLOR'S IN ORBIT hit the left side of the gate at the start, and was outrun. PROSPECTIVE DIVA broke slowly and was outrun.
GLORY ROLL checked sharply midway on the turn, and dropped back. The half-mile fraction was hand timed.

Footnotes
CHEZ PAREE settled off the pace two wide, circled four wide around the far turn, seized command in upper stretch and drew off under a drive.
HEIRESSINDY was bumped after the start, stalked the pace four wide, took over nearing the three-eighths pole, angled into the two path, led to upper
stretch but had no answer for the winner. INDICIA lagged well back inside for six furlongs, angled three wide to pass tiring rivals near the quarter pole,
quickly angled back to the rail in upper stretch and rallied for the show. TWILIGHT chased the pace inside, angled three wide and was roused leaving the
three-eighths pole but lacked a rally. FURIA VIKINGA (CHI) saved ground off the pace early, advanced four wide around the far turn and flattened out
through the final furlong. ABILENE TRAIL was fractious in the gate, set the pace in the two path, angled in nearing the far turn and retreated.
CARISMATICA was bumped early, pressed the pace in the three path and was through after a half.

MONARCHS GLEN (GB) broke a step slow, advanced entering the far turn while moving in from the four-path, bid outside RENAISANCE FROLIC in upper
stretch, gained the upper hand and edged clear nearing the wire. RENAISANCE FROLIC took control early, rated along clear inside to the stretch,
responded when hooked by the eventual winner, yielded late and saved the place. STIRLING DRIVE moved inside entering the first turn, advanced after six
furlongs while getting out-moved by MONARCHS GLEN, shifted out for the drive and ran on with good courage narrowly missing second. HAY DAKOTA
saved ground early, moved up around the far turn two to three wide, and finished evenly. SPEED FRANCO bumped with EPIC BROMANCE at the start,
raced three wide and was finished early. NOBLE INDY faded inside after a half-mile. EPIC BROMANCE bumped with SPEED FRANCO at the start, chased
the pacesetter for a half, and was through on the far turn.

Footnotes
EL SOLITARIO raced in range inside for five furlongs, advanced four wide around the far turn, seized command nearing the quarter pole and drew off under
a drive. SULEMAN raced off the pace two wide, made progress around the far turn and rallied for the place. PERFECT ENOUGH settled off the pace along
the inside, steadied in somewhat tight nearing the quarter pole, got through soon after and stayed on to gain the place. ANGEL'S ENTRY was bumped at
the start, raced two wide off the pace around both turns and improved position in the lane. TONE FEELIN was bumped at the start, chased the pace two
and three wide and lacked the needed rally. GUN OF GLORY was bumped at the start, prompted the pace two wide, took the lead between rivals near the
five-sixteenths pole but weakened in the lane. CALABASH was bumped at the start, lacked speed inside, went three to four wide around the far turn and
never threatened. WITH REWARD was bumped at the start, raced well back three wide early, made a four wide middle move into contention then retreated
through the lane. MONETIZED set the pace inside and tired. HARD ASTRAY had brief speed three wide.
