Footnotes
ALLOUTPATRICIA was unhurried while in the three path through the first turn, continued to slowly advance closer up the backstretch, was three wide in
mid-turn, continued to advance on the leader while under a steady ride, bid into the lane, caught the leader outside the eighth pole then drove past and
widened to the wire. BEHOLD set the pace while under some pressure into the far turn, was still on the front end into the lane, stayed with the winner to just
inside the eighth pole then was no match for that one while lasting for the place spot. WANNA HAVE FUN was in the two or three path through the far turn
when never far back, bid into the lane then was closing in on the place spot at the wire. B DEB'S FORTUNE stalked the pacesetter while in the two path into
the far turn then weakened. QUIET DAWN was never a threat while along the inside through the turns. REWARDED chased the pace while along the inside
through the far turn then faded after entering the lane. LION LOVE was done after moving into the far turn while in the two path.

Footnotes
GINORMOUS was unhurried while along the inside through the far turn, came into the lane from the three path, under a drive through the lane while being
guided to the seven or eight path then surged up in the last thirty yards to win going away. MINTCHOCOLATECHIP was in the four path through the far turn
when chasing the pace, bid into the lane from the four path and between rivals, inched to the front with an eighth to go, maintained a short advantage
despite several challengers, looked to be a winner in deep stretch then was outfinished by the top one. AIKEN TO BE TAKIN vied for the lead two wide into
the far turn, gained a short lead into the lane, relinquished the advantage with a furlong to go then gave ground grudgingly the final eighth.
RUNNINAWAYWITHIT was in the two path through the turn while in the two path, bid into the lane, was close up with a clear lane then weakened late.
QUIET CONTENDER raced in the three path through the turn, bid into the lane, was between rivals inside the eighth pole and a contender then flattened
late. MISTY EXPRESS settled off the duel down the backstretch, moved up to bid between rivals near the three-eighths pole, continued close proximity into
the lane and was empty. BRIBE vied for the lead through the turn then gave way entering the lane. LADY STELLA was near the rail through the far turn and
had little to give. BABES ON A BUDGET was outrun while in the four path through the turn. TOO CROWDED was outrun while in the three path through the
far turn.

Footnotes
CHICKEN TRUCK chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid three wide in late turn and into the lane, hooked up outside the eighth pole with
the runner-up, dueled with that one through the final eighth and inched up. THAT KHENNY set the pace while some pressure in late turn, shook off one
challenger straightening in the lane, was joined by the winner soon after and could not hold that one safe while well clear for the place spot. ORB OF THE
BORO chased the pacesetter through the turn, bid into the lane and appeared a serious threat then could not sustain the effort while best of the rest. SAINT
VRAIN was unhurried while in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and moved up while not a threat to the show rival.
CACHACO never a factor while in the two path through the turn. EL PIQUIN raced in the four path through the turn and tired. MONEY POINT outrun while in
the two path through the turn. HANDSOME EFFORT was along the inside through the turn when steadily fading.

Footnotes
BRANDONS DANGER stumbled at the start, stalked in the four path, bid at the three-eighths pole, dueled outside of a foe, was clear at the eighth pole, then
shifted in the final yards from the whip in front of a rival. BEAV'S BOO vied between foes, settled off the pace, bid at the sixteenth pole and steadied late.
VILLAREGGIA vied three wide, dueled inside of the winner and then gave way. LYRICIST was unrushed inside, then had no bid. MUNNINGS SOUL vied
inside, then gave way. TIZ ABBY faded. OXBOWINDY was through early three wide. The Stewards upheld an objection by the rider of BEAV'S BOO
against BRANDONS DANGER, disqualifying her and placing her second. They dismissed an objection by the trainer of VILLAREGGIA against BRANDONS
DANGER for alleged interference in early stretch.

leader but had no late bid. AIR WONDERFUL stalked in the four path, bid at the half and then faltered on the turn. FAITHFUL NEIGHBOR led inside to the
