Footnotes
UNO away a length the tardiest after making contact with MASKED MARAUDER in the shadow of the starting gate, was under hand urging right from the
get-go, departed the backstretch from along the outer rim of path three, crept up menacingly as the half was being completed, settled onto the head of the
stretch and saw the rider to to work, fought its way to the front during the ensuing furlong, came out after some left side pressure in midstretch yet steadily
extended the winning margin nonetheless. BIG BROWN SHOES grabbed the top early on the backstretch, was in path two showing the way, attended by
HANGOUT from the outside until the five-sixteenths pole, had the top one replace the aforementioned opponent as the primary pursuer late on the turn, got
cued up for the drive home, yielded racing through the furlong grounds, held on to save second. MASKED MARAUDER brushed with the winner after
coming out at the start, settled into stride and worked out a tuck into the two path by the conclusion of the backstretch, loosely drafted behind the pacesetter,
spun into the lane, got outfinished. FORTY TWO ACE took the inside route for the opening half, angled three wide into the lane, lacked the necessary
response. HANGOUT pursued the pace three wide on the turn, wandered out into path four in upper stretch while backing away.

Footnotes
RUDE AWAKING established the top after a light hand ride, showed the way from along the inside route on backstretch, was more in path two leading the
competition on the turn, struck the three-sixteenths pole and got asked for a response, offered it up, leaving the eighth pole holding her largest advantage,
saw a threesome bearing down hard late, dug in to prevail. WICKED TITLE strung out four to five wide on the turn, flashed interest as the second fraction
was being finalized, got sent out onto path seven during the stretch run, closed in, getting up for the place. SKY KITTEN off the inside throughout, took up
the chase three wide on the turn, got roused by the three-eighths pole, fanned out into path six from upper to midlane, gained ground in a steadfast manner,
came up short. LOOKBOTHWAYS underwent a two wide journey for the initial half, swung out four wide onto the top of the lane, narrowed in, flattened out
slightly late. EVAN'S NICE NOW spotted along the inside route nearing the end of the backstretch, went on to save ground to no avail. APPLETINI stalked
the pace four wide on the turn, commenced the stretch slightly, gave way. HAPPY SOPHIA broke open the gate, proceeded to came out of the gate without
apparent mishap, prompted the pace from path three for nearly a half, before faltering.

Footnotes
MONEY IN THE BANK brushed at the start by I SAW IT ALL who broke in a step, chased just off the inside from near the rear of the compact field, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and tipped out swinging six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final
furlong and was up in the last jumps to the finish to prevail. SPITBALL dueled from the three path with VICTORY BUILT to his inside down the backstretch,
got shaken off a bit and prompted the leader tucked to the two path through the turn between foes from the five-sixteenths as a pair stacked outside, spun
three wide for home, dug in knocking heads through the length of the stretch with VICTORY BUILT and was caught in tandem by the eventual winner in the
final strides while winning the battle for the place honors. VICTORY BUILT dueled from the two path with the aforementioned foe to his outside, tucked
inside and shook that rival off a bit before being pressured by a trio through the latter portion of the turn, spun just off the inside for home, dug in stubborn
dueling once more with SPITBALL through the length of the stretch but was caught in the late stages in concert with his main rival then got bested for the
place honors at the end. I SAW IT ALL broke in a step at the start brushing MONEY IN THE BANK, chased four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. STARSHIP BUBBA three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. ONWARD chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, spun two to three
wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
FED FUNDS raced at a considerable distance from off the rail after making contact with TWELFTH LABOUR right after the field had been sent on its way,
pursued the pace three to four wide, the widest of all, on the turn, moved up menacingly at the second split was about to be posted, settled in at the top of
the stretch and was given his cue, forged to the front end during the ensuing furlong, kept going on with good energy and edged away. ROAD TO MEATH
sparred for control from the two path, well rated for the opening half, turned into the lane on dead even terms with the winner, relinquished as the twosome
dueled over the course of the next eighth, stayed on late to preserve the place. SMILE BRYAN stumbled at the start, recovered and took up the chase from
off the inside, travelled three wide on the turn, got sent out into path five from upper to midstretch, came up short of snagging away second. TWELFTH
LABOUR bumped with FED FUNDS at the start, took up the chase from the two path during the run around the bend, went into the stretch from the same
path, gave way. LIGHT THE POSSE quickly positioned along the rail, rode it until the end of the bend, angled four wide into the stretch, had no offering.
ALONGCAMETHEPRINCE forwardly placed inside, faltered.

MISS COMEDIAN coaxed from the gate, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the
very last jump to the wire to score. BIG TONY'S GIRL coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed five then four wide advancing to take command at the
five-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat
and was nailed at the finish while well clear of the rest. WISH FOR MAGIC got bumped at the start by FULL OF FIRE due to pressure from
GABBY'SGOLDENVOICE, chased three then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and improved position to
secure the show honors while never threatening the top pair. ROSEY'S PEACH broke in at the start and was corrected, showed the way early on before
being headed by FULL OF FIRE five furlongs from home, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along
from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. VIVE LA LIBERTY got bumped at the start by MADAME ROSE who ducked in
and was carried in three to four paths into the crest of the clubhouse turn put to tight restraint trying to extract herself from the situation and conceded about
twelve lengths to the front, tipped out seven paths off the inside detached at the tail of the field, tucked to the two path into the turn coming under coaxing
near the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to make up ground and position to the finish after a very rough
beginning. GABBY'SGOLDENVOICE brushed the off side stall at the start, then came inwards bumping FULL OF FIRE into WISH FOR MAGIC, chased five
to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went seven wide into
upper stretch and offered no rally. ADIRONDACK QUEEN chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and through the turn coaxed along from
three furlongs out, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and tired. FULL OF FIRE got bumped at the start by GABBY'SGOLDENVOICE, who came
inwards and in turn bumped WISH FOR MAGIC, raced three wide in aim of the leader before taking over five furlongs from home, tucked to the two path
through the turn, yielded the front at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. THE GREAT POOHDINI chased along the
inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, tired
and was eased through the final furlong. MADAME ROSE ducked in at the start carrying VIVE LA LIBERTY in with her three to four paths into the crest of
the clubhouse turn under restraint and correction to no avail and conceded ten lengths to the front, tipped out nine to ten paths off the inside down the
backstretch, went five wide through the turn and into upper stretch and was eased.

WEGOTOLDYOUGOTSOLD disputed the pace from the two path, was confidently-ridden taking over the lead as the second fraction was being finalized,
arrived at the quarter pole approximately four wide and switched over to stronger handling, responded and steadily kicked clear. FOX RED briefly placed
along the inside route during the initial stages, tipped to the outside after entering the turn, ventured onward on it primarily three wide, got steered about five
wide into the lane, secured second. TALE OF MIST tracked the pace from along the rail for the opening half, was under a drive heading home, tipped out
into path three during the early stages of the stretch run, flashed some late foot en route for the show. PROFESSOR SNAPE three wide entering the turn,
was sent out six wide exiting it, gave way. WUSHU WARRIOR argued for control from along the inside matched up with the top one, was the first of that pair
to have its pilot commit to a drive, this occurring a few jumps shy of the end of the bend, stepped into the lane and faltered. OUR HONOR spotted the others
a five length head start after hesitating at the start, travelled four wide on the turn, as the widest of all, was then moved out towards path seven in the
stretch, continuing onward as the widest of all, never made its presence felt.

Footnotes
MISCHIEF AFOOT four wide into the first turn, tucked to the two path soon after, chased three wide down the backstretch and then four to five wide through
the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying under an off sided stick and came in
brushing with DUDLEY SQUARE inside the sixteenth pole then just got up on the wire to prevail over a pair. DUDLEY SQUARE coaxed from the gate,
showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat from flanking
rivals, got headed near the sixteenth marker, then got brushed and carried in by MISCHIEF AFOOT and was just up for the place honors on the wire. V. I. P.
TICKET chased just off the inside from mid pack among a tightly compact group, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home,
rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command inside the final sixteenth briefly before being nailed at the finish. OUR LAST BUCK toss
his head at the start getting away a bit awkward, raced six wide into the first turn and went five wide through that bend, chased five wide down the
backstretch and through the far turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, continued five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. FIRST
LINE stumbled at the start, raced five wide into the first turn and went four wide through that bend, chased four wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home and tired. FRIED RICE KING three wide through the first turn, chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, folded, and was eased through to the finish. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into deep stretch focusing on
MISCHIEF AFOOT in relation to DUDLEY SQUARE. After review the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
TRI SAINT LORENZO guided into the three path, contended as the outermost of three for command for the opening six furlongs, got turned loose stepping
onto the top of the lane, took charge during the ensuing furlong and drew off. UNBRIDLED JOHN cut over to the rail, vied for lead against a pair of
opponents to the outside for most of the initial three-quarters pole, proved no match once the stretch drive began, stayed on for the place. UNCLE NED
pursued the pace from path two, fanned out six wide from upper to midstretch, mustered up a mild response sufficient enough to secure the show. TIZME
BOBBY MCGEE off the inside throughout, chased the pace three wide, was moved out into path eight after entering the stretch, inched up for the last major
check. CONFECTIONER in path two, fought for the top from between the first finishers until the end of the bend, backed away in the final furlong. TIZ ENVY
bumped shortly after the start, was sighted two wide at the top of the turn, angled five wide into the lane, had no punch. ACROSS THE CHANNEL tracked
the front runners from along the inside, came under a ride after leaving the backstretch, was taken in hand, forced to idle behind another for approximately a
sixteenth, beginning from the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, got re-roused in time to cut the corner into the stretch, came up empty. LORENZEN
off the rail, raced three wide on the turn, was about as wide spinning into the stretch, gave way. SEEDISKID made some contact with TIZ ENVY early on the
chute, went over to the inside, saved ground for nearly three-quarters, shifted out four wide for the drive, had no offering.
