Footnotes
DOUBLE WHOPPER cleared soon after the start, raced under pressure into the turn, re-cleared in mid-turn, widened into the lane and was kept to the task
to the end to hold. GOLDEN GRANT was unhurried while trailing the small field into the turn, was asked for more in mid-turn, began gaining momentum
through late turn and into the lane and finished with good energy while running out of real estate. TAYLOR AVENUE was in the two or three path through
the turn and into the lane, was gaining on the top one late when outfinished for the place spot. CHANDANA chased the pace from the two path through the
turn, was closest to the winner into the lane then weakened nearing the eighth pole. SEEKING SECA steadily faded along the inside.

Footnotes
HERE COMES TREY set the pace on a clear lead from the outset, continued with a comfortable advantage through the turn and into the lane and widened
the advantage through the final eighth while being kept to the task. MAJOR SPARKS was in the two path through the far turn, came into the lane from the
three path and was all out to gain the place spot while not a threat to the top one. PROUD N FAMOUS chased the winner from the three path into the far
turn, was asked for more entering the lane, could not gain on the winner and lost the place spot late. MILLION DOLLAR RED stumbled at the start and
spotted the field some two lengths, moved up to chase the pace from the three path into the far turn ,was asked for more entering the lane and lacked the
needed response while losing the show spot late. COMES N THREES was never a serious threat while saving ground. TWOBIRDSONESTONE was
always in the back while racing near the inside.

Footnotes
BAYOU CAT pressed the pace three wide into the far turn, dueled with another through late turn and into the lane, continued the duel through the final
eighth and just stayed up. MAI TAI'S GEM stalked the pace from the two path into the far turn, bid with the winner in mid-turn, dueled with that one while
moving closer to the inside, continued on near even terms to the wire and was just outfinished and settled for second best. REDYORNOTHEREICOME was
unhurried while in the three path into the turn, was asked for more in late turn, continued under a drive through the lane and could only gain the minor share.
STOP HAMMERTIME was near the rail into the turn, came off the inside to pass anther in mid-turn, continued along the rail into the lane then lacked the
needed response through the lane. MAX EXPRESS was in the four path through the turn when never far back, asked for more into the lane and weakened.
BANDIDO DE AMORES raced in the three path through the far turn and tired after entering the lane. MATERS N TATERS set the pace into the far turn then
gave way in mid-turn.

Footnotes
FASHION MO was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the five to the four path through the turn, swung into the lane from the five path when
under strong momentum, caught the leader outside the eighth pole then was kept to the task to the end while drifting closer to the rail. AUNTIE MABEL set
the pace from near the rail, continued on a clear lead into the lane, could not hold off the winner with a furlong to go then kept on well to remain clear for the
place spot. GRACEFUL CHOICE was unhurried while near the inside, gained momentum in late turn while moving off the inside, swung into the lane from
the eight path and finished with good energy. TWITTERPATED chased the pacesetter into the turn while in the two path, was asked for more near the
three-eighths pole, continued under a drive into the lane and lacked the needed response. GO TWEET pressed then chased the pace while along the inside
into the lane then weakened. TRIANGLE PARK was asked for more in mid-turn when in the four to the three path then weakened turning into the lane.
EKATI EMPRESS was never a factor while in the two path through the far turn. TIZ PENNEY raced in the three path through the far turn, came into the lane
from the five path with some momentum, took a bad step approaching the sixteenth pole and was put in hand. IMBUED chased the pace from the three path
into the turn and was done nearing the three-eighths pole. CANDYCREAM steadily faded along the inside. The half-mile time was omitted due to a timer
malfunction.

Footnotes
BLOODY MARY MORNIN was unhurried while in the two path into the turn, gained momentum in late turn, angled into the four path in late turn, entered the
lane from the six path when gaining momentum under minimal urging, swept up to the leader just inside the eighth pole while the rider sat chilly, shook her
up in the last seventy yards and drew clear in an impressive performance. OVER THE BLUES chased the pace from the inside through the turn, cut the
corner after passing the faltering pacesetter, gained the lead at once, cleared when straightening then was no match for the winner while clearly second
best. SHEESA PONTIAC pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, was asked for more into the lane and settled for best of the rest. SEDUCTIVE (IRE)
settled early while off the inside, bid four wide through the far turn to get into contention, came into the lane from the five path and weakened. AZILOOK bid
four wide into the turn to get close and was tiring into the lane. AIR TURBULENCE was in the two path through the turn turns and was never a serious
threat. HOLLY GO LIGHTLY hopped at the start, raced five wide through the far turn and tired entering the lane. TRAUMARAMA was never a factor while
while in the three path. FIRST HUNTER stalked the pace from the three path into the turn and was done near the three-eighths pole. MAJESTIC BOLD set
the pace along the inside and was suddenly done near the quarter pole. HER GOLD MINE was done early while along the inside.

WHITE WOLF vied outside of a foe, then was challenged in early stretch, went clear and lasted under mild urging. TALE OF FAME stalked between rivals,
angled four wide in the stretch and rallied late. LIBERTARIAN stalked in the four path but couldn't close late. GHOSTLY WHO pressed in the three path
before yielding. STEEL SHOT stalked in the four path, then couldn't close late. NAUGHTY ALFRED raced evenly. WILL KNOWS was not a factor.
