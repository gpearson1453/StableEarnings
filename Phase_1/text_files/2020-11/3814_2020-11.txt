Footnotes
MADDIE'S MUSIC set a well handled pace from the start, drew off on the turn then was kept to task and held sway in the end. SALACIOUSACUSATION
rallied four wide on the turn making a strong bid but came up empty and was second best. WHATEVER COMES chased the early pace while three wide into
the turn, made a bid then faltered in the drive. KEEPING SECRETS was unhurried early then rallied and swung out to be five in upper stretch, closed
ground willingly in late stretch but was too late. RARE WARRIOR was steadied off heels heading into the turn and taken up, dropped back then made a mild
rally while four wide on the turn and stretch but was no menace. BLUEGRASS DIXIE chased the early pace while inside, was used up then gave way.
SARAH'S STAR was unhurried early then saved ground but was no threat. WHYNOTDAN chased the early pace while three wide, was used up and gave
way. IAMINTERESTING was unhurried early and no threat. THIRSTY LUCY was unhurried early and was outrun.
