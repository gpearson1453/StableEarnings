Footnotes
KIFFLE set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane then drew away down the lane while ridden out to the wire. SHACKLEFORD COUNTY stalked
the pace early on, was in the five path into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run. MERADA chased the pace early, was off the rail into the
lane with a mild gain in the stretch drive. CENTERFOLD ANGEL hopped at the start, chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and flattened
out late in the stretch run. PARKING TICKET was never a factor. KIMBERLEY DREAM broke awkwardly and was through after a half. STROLLIN THE
BAYOU tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and was empty down the lane.

Footnotes
MRS. O'CONNELL stalked along the inside, then from the pocket around the far turn, tipped outside of the pace setter passing the quarter pole, and rallied
to forge an advantage passing the furlong pole. SYLVIA Q set the pace along the inside, dug in to hold an advantage in upper stretch, but was headed at
the furlong pole, fought on while flopping back to his left lead, but yielded late. ALWAYZ LATE lied forwardly placed three wide, but chased inner foes
through the lane and failed to make late headway. POINT OF INFINITY saved ground from midpack around both turns, shifted to the five path through
midstretch, and finished up willingly to claim a minor reward. LET'S SKEDADDLE prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace after MRS.
O'CONNELL shifted her out passing the quarter pole. TARA HILL (IRE) raced off of the pace two wide, inched closer turning for home, shifted inwards
passing the quarter pole, but lacked a kick to produce a bid. MCNALLY lied off of the pace three wide, got floated to the five path by SWEET WORKOUT
approaching the five sixteenths pole, and failed to factor thereafter. SWEET WORKOUT raced far off of the pace in the two path, got rank around the first
turn, advanced between foes into the far turn before tipping to the four path at the five sixteenths pole, but flattened out in upper stretch. STEPHEN'S JOY
trailed throughout. REBUFF saved ground far off of the pace before swinging five wide turning for home, but broke down passing the furlong pole, fell, and
was vanned off.

Footnotes
SCARRED vied outside of MIDLANER, forged an advantage from that foe in upper stretch, willingly drew off approaching the furlong pole, and held sway
through the late stages. HOLY REDEEMER stalked along the inside, tipped three wide passing the quarter pole, but chased the clear leader through the
final furlong to prove second best. PRIVATE NETWORK settled off of the pace along the inside, advanced by saving ground turning for home to chase from
behind the leaders in upper stretch, tipped to the four path through midstretch, and sustained his grinding charge to edge show in the late stages.
MIDLANER set the pace along the inside while feeling stern pressure from the eventual winner, got headed by that foe in upper stretch, and gave way
thereafter. SAQEEL raced well off of the pace along the inside early on, tipped to the four path around the turn before swinging to the five path turning for
home, and improved past tiring foes. TWO PRINCES was off a step slow, raced far off of the pace in the two path, and passed tired foes along the rail
through the lane. WARRIOR IN CHIEF tracked from off of the pace in the five path around the turn, inched closer turning for home, but flattened out in upper
stretch. TAP GOLD stalked four wide, but weakened in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead. RICOCHET tracked from midpack in the three to four
path around the turn, tipped to the six path turning for home, but lacked a rally. UNION GAP hopped at the start and was off slowly, raced far off of the pace
three wide around the turn, and never got involved. VEGAS GUY prompted the pace three wide, but weakened between horses turning for home. CROSBY
STREET dwelt at the start, trailed the field by a very wide margin throughout, and showed little.

CASH NOW set the pace along the inside, dug in inside of foes to hold an advantage through upper stretch, and clung to that margin through the lane. FIRE
MARSHALL BILL inched closer four wide around the turn to produce a bid in upper stretch, but hung and failed to reach the inside pace setter. HAYDENS
HAVOC saved ground in midpack, chased from behind the leading trio in upper stretch, was smoothly guided four wide through midstretch to be outside of
those foes, and stayed on to achieve show. ROB THE RICH reared in the gates before they opened, then was off a step slowly when they did, stalked the
pace three wide, inched closer into the turn to vie around the bend, held vying position in upper stretch as FIRE MARSHALL BILL also ranged up alongside,
but flattened out between rivals at the furlong pole. ITS A WRAP was off a step slowly, trailed the field through the turn, swung to the five path at the quarter
pole, then failed to factor, and bled. GROOVY LEMON PIE stalked two wide, vied between horses in to the turn, but weakened passing the five sixteenths
pole.

Footnotes
FROSTMOURNE cleared off passing the wire for the first time, held a loose lead down the backstretch, received a breather into and around the far turn as
MADE YOU LOOK inched closer, repelled that foe passing the quarter pole, drew off with a swift turn of foot, and was geared down through the final
sixteenth. MADE YOU LOOK stalked along the inside around the first turn, shifted outside of the loose leader and inched closer to that foe into and around
the far turn, produced a bid at the five sixteenths pole, but was guided to the five path passing the quarter pole as his inner counterpart held his path, which
caused him to be repelled by that foe in upper stretch, then held place through the lane. SNAPPER SINCLAIR stalked two wide while outside of MADE YOU
LOOK, came under a drive into the far turn to inch closer with that foe, but failed to do so around the bend, then chased through the lane, produced a bid for
place inside of MADE YOU LOOK, but did not have enough to catch him. MR. MISUNDERSTOOD tracked from midpack while being caught in the five path
into the first turn, tucked down to the two path around that bend, tracked two wide around the far turn before tipping to the four path turning for home, but
rallied evenly through the lane and failed to produce a bid. BIG SCORE saved ground far off of the pace, and improved along the rail in the late stages with
mild interest. PARLOR took a stuttered step at the start, raced far off of the pace along the inside around the first turn, got keen from kickback while two
wide into the backstretch, then took the far turn three wide before tipping to the five path turning for home, but lacked a rally. TELL YOUR DADDY tracked
from midpack in the four to three path around the first turn, saved ground around the far turn, but weakened through the final furlong. JASIKAN (IRE) was off
slowly, and trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
COULD YOU set the pace along the inside, shook free from a trio of bidding foes passing the quarter pole, drew off in upper stretch, and held sway. IRISH
WILLOW stalked three wide around the turn, inched closer turning for home inside of VEILED VIXEN, but failed to keep pace with an inner foe in upper
stretch, and held place thereafter. VEILED VIXEN lied forwardly four wide, inched closer turning for home to bid for the lead outside of a trio of foes at the
quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with then pace setter in upper stretch, leveled off, then just held show. CREATE A STORY chased from midpack along
the inside, bid for show inside of VEILED VIXEN in the final furlong and missed that position on the wire. ORB'S SOUL was off slowly, raced far off of the
pace three wide, and improved through the lane. LETTERS TO BELLE pressed two wide, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. BOW DOWN
TEWMEY bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace two wide, and did not factor. BLONDE BY NATURE bumped with an inner foe at the
start, raced off of the pace three to four wide, and did not make an impact. DUCHES OF GRACE was outrun. ACTRESS ON BOARD was off slowly, saved
ground around the turn, and weakened.
