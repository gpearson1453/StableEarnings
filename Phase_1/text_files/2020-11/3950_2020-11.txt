Footnotes
SILVER EDGE was urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the backstretch, disputed the issue on the far turn, then turned
back a challenge from PRIZED WARRIOR racing through the stretch under energetic handling to go clear. The latter was urged to terms prompting the
pacesetter racing to the first turn, continued to stalk that foe to the second bend, was urged to challenge between foes nearing upper stretch but proved no
match in the drive. SUPER EDGAR tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the first turn, then between foes entering the backstretch, saved
ground to upper stretch, then shifted out in the closing stages to edge a rival for a share. SILENT MISCHIEF tracked off the first flight between foes in the
opening half, shifted three wide racing into the far turn to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the lane. BIG CITY RALPH tracked the
leaders three, then four wide as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded outside foes racing through the far turn. TRAVELIN'
SONG worked his way to the inside early while coming under some prompting to gain terms with the second flight entering the backstretch but came up
empty racing into the far turn. HALEL was settled last racing in the three path to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. THE RACE WAS HAND
TIMED.

Footnotes
NED DEVINE, off a step slowly, was caught wide racing to the first turn dropping well off the second flight, continued unhurried outside foes into the
backstretch, gained some momentum three deep on the far turn, advanced in tandem with a rival to bid for command between foes nearing midstretch and
narrowly prevailed on the wire under firm left handed pressure. PAINTER'S PRIDE, bumped at the start, was settled last to the backstretch, switched
outside foes after a half, steadily advanced to contention four wide through the far turn to upper stretch, bid in tandem with the eventual winner racing past
midstretch and just missed. NICOLE MUNNINGS broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside racing to the backstretch, turned
back several challengers racing to the far turn, shifted out while under pressure to resist the top pair and contested the issue grudgingly to the wire while
failing to contain those rivals. BOXER BOY broke in bumping at the start, was rated off the second flight while shifting out four wide racing into the
backstretch, steadily advanced on the pacesetter racing into the far turn, bid between foes entering upper stretch but flattened out late. INSPIRATO (MEX)
tracked the pace inside foes in second flight to the backstretch and steadily faded nearing the lane. BRANDT, held up out of close quarters racing into the
first turn to track just off the second flight, continued between foes through the backstretch and came up empty entering the far turn. ENTERTAINER tracked
just off the pacesetter three wide between foes racing to the backstretch and faded after a half. DONE ACTING, caught four wide racing into the first turn
while urged to a forward placing, shifted inwards entering the backstretch to briefly prompt the leader but was spent early. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
ADONAI BLESS tracked the leaders from out of striking distance outside rivals as part of the second flight racing through the backstretch, steadily advanced
on the leaders three deep racing into the turn to gain a narrow advantage in upper stretch, then responded to left handed pressure and firm hand urging to
turn back RISEN CHANGE to go clear in time. The latter broke readily, angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight, steadily gained contention
between foes racing into the turn, altered course when lacking a path nearing upper stretch to race four wide entering the lane moving to terms with the
eventual winner but couldn't match that foe in the drive. CHIQUI THE GRAY, urged to a forward placing along the rail, pressed the issue on the turn into
upper stretch but weakened late. MARDI GRAS GIRL angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch into the turn and gave
way between foes entering the lane. MISS UNDERSTANDING settled last near the inside early and never gained contention. LANGUE LIEE was a brief
factor between foes in second flight, but retreated early.

Footnotes
FLORIDA EXPRESS, bumped at the start, was collected, then reserved along the inside in last to the backstretch, saved ground gradually gaining
momentum racing into the far turn, swung out five wide entering upper stretch and responded to firm left handed pressure to wrest the advantage and go
clear in time. DRAMATIC KITTEN broke readily, was urged to dictate the pace while angling to the rail entering the first turn, dueled for command inside
foes racing through the backstretch into the far turn, was headed in upper stretch but continued with a grudging effort to save the place honors while no
match for the winner. SWEET GIANT was rated just off the leaders in early stages, advanced on the first turn to press the issue three wide between foes
through the backstretch into the far turn and continued willingly four deep between foes late. ANALYZEYOURVISION attended the pace in the opening
stages, switched outside the pacesetter racing into the first turn to press the issue between foes, dueled for command between foes into the far turn, gained
a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch but faltered in the final sixteenth. ESTILO PELIGROSO settled outside foes racing to the first turn, shifted out
to race four wide through the far turn to upper stretch and made some belated progress. FEISTY KITTEN, caught five wide nearing the first turn, angled
inwards to track off the first flight outside foes to the backstretch, shifted in on the far turn, gained some position between foes racing into upper stretch, then
was gathered up in the closing stages when caught in tight quarters late. FRENCH KISS ME, a bit restless in the gate, angled to the inside tracking off the
first flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch gaining brief contention but proved empty leaving the furlong marker. IFEELGOOD broke
out bumping the eventual winner soundly, was collected, then urged three, then four wide between foes prompting the pace to the backstretch, emptied out
racing into the far turn. WICKYDIDIT, pulling hard against restraint in the opening stages, was caught four wide between foes racing into the first turn,
continued five wide into the backstretch and dropped out early. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

OBIWAN, firmly rated inside foes tracking just off the first flight into the backstretch, came around a tiring foe nearing upper stretch to bid inside the leader
entering the lane and wrested the advantage in the closing stages under strong handling. FLY NIGHTLY tracked just off the second flight between foes in
the opening half, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and made steady late progress to prevail for the place honors. HELLFIRE BOB, forwardly
placed three deep attending the pace in the opening half, shifted inwards racing into the far turn to press the issue into the lane gaining a brief advantage
but yielded to the top pair late. BRICE, bumped at the start, pulled his way to contention three deep between foes while racing in tight quarters into the
backstretch, lodged a brief, three wide bid on the far turn but flattened out racing into the lane. VICTORY TOUR settled last dropping well off the field to the
backstretch and passed between tiring rivals in the closing stages. STUNNING BABY, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter in the
opening half, faded from contention early. SORCIER, caught outside foes while steadying slightly avoiding some traffic on the first turn, continued four wide
through the backstretch, angled inwards racing into the lane but proved empty in the drive. AGRIPINO broke inwards bumping BRICE, was righted, then
urged along the inside setting the pace to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. PLAN OF ATTACK, rated along the inside to the backstretch,
dropped out early. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
TWIN VALOR was settled in hand in the opening stages while shifting well to the outside racing through the backstretch, made steady progress advancing
on the leaders through the turn while shifting to the five path racing into upper stretch, moved to terms with MISTER STORM in the closing stages and
narrowly edged that foe under firm handling. The latter, urged to dictate the pace soon after the break racing off the rail through the backstretch into the turn,
turned back foes to go clear racing into upper stretch but was collared late. STAR JUANCHO tracked off the second flight between foes through the
backstretch, angled in nearing upper stretch to split rivals just off the inside and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. DOUBLE DEEP angled to
the inside early tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn and faded into the stretch. FOURTH DESIGN, held up avoiding close quarters just after the
start, shifted to the four path nearing the turn while being prompted to advance, briefly gained striking position but gave out in late stages. PLATO settled
along the inside in the opening stages, angled out on the turn to race six wide entering the stretch but made no impression. GRINGO STAR, forwardly
placed three deep under some prompting racing to the turn, gave way nearing the lane. GETTININTOMISCHIEF angled to the inside early and steadily
retreated racing into the turn. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
PLAY THE MAX broke readily, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin racing a bit off the rail, held sway into the lane and was kept to firm
encouragement. MERMAID KISSES tracked just off the pacesetter between foes racing into the turn, couldn't gain terms with the winner but continued with
interest to edge rivals for the place honors. SOCIALLY ASTRAY dropped off the second flight from between foes racing through the backstretch, angled to
the rail nearing upper stretch and continued willingly to edge rivals for a share. LA WAPA ducked out at the start, tracked off the second flight near the
inside, continued between foes into the lane but was outkicked for a share. MS. GENUINE tracked just off the second flight three wide between foes racing
into the turn and continued evenly to late stages. DONA CAMILE tracked off the second flight racing four wide into the turn, was fanned six wide entering
the lane but faded late. LADY AND ME broke slowly, settled outside foes, switched out nearing upper stretch, was fanned seven wide entering the lane and
made no real impression. RED KITTEN worked her way to the inside dropping well off the leaders racing to the turn and failed to menace. SMARTY CAT
tracked the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing three deep into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. PRINCES DYNAMITE settled outside
foes early and proved no threat. JENNA DAWN proved no factor. PRINCESS JAVONCIA was forced out at the start and dropped out early.

Footnotes
SUCCESSFUL LEGACY broke readily, gained a forward placing along the rail while conceding the lead, tracked just off the pacesetter to the far turn,
shifted out three wide in upper stretch and produced a solid late response to just edge SPIN CLASS in time under firm handling. The latter raced in touch
from the outset stalking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn into upper stretch to gain a narrow advantage and
resisted the winner to the end. YOU NEVER CALL, pulled his way to the lead from between foes, then angling inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin
to the far turn, dueled for command into the lane but couldn't contain the top pair late. GOLD COUNTRY switched out early to race three deep tracking off
the second flight, was urged to lodge a brief bid in that path racing into the far turn but faded in the drive. BEE DANNA settled between foes racing to the
backstretch, shifted out entering the lane, exchanged bumps with INPENDING BREEZE in late stages and made no real impression. INPENDING BREEZE
tracked off the second flight between foes to the far turn, shifted three deep entering the lane while exchanging bumps late and came up empty. DANCING
IN FIRE angled to the inside tracking off the second flight, saved ground to the lane but lacked a rally. ATLANTIC PRINCESS broke slowly, switched outside
rivals racing to the backstretch but failed to menace. GOLDEN OLDIE switched out racing into the backstretch to make brief progress four wide between
foes but emptied out nearing the second bend. PONZI broke awkwardly, then was steadied while being righted early, was caught five wide racing past the
half mile marker and quickly dropped back.
