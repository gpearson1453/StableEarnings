Footnotes
PRINCESS ROBBI last away then was allowed to settle inside, drove four wide into the lane, responded to handling mid stretch and won driving. CAN'T
TOUCH THIS set a pressured pace while three to four wide, gained a short advantage through the turn and was ran down late. NOTICE rated off the pace
from the two path, rallied three wide through the stretch and missed for place. LA MER settled outside then was brushed nearing the far turn, went in pursuit
of the leader at the five sixteenth pole and flattened out in the stretch. BONNIE TRADER prompted the pace from just off the rail, was unable to move on
with outside rival and finished evenly. DOLLY DAGGER lugged out leaving the backstretch, brushed outside rival and faded. PURE ROSE contested the
pace from between rivals and left nothing in reserve for the drive.

Footnotes
BIG AL'S VISION sat in striking position while three wide, was asked to quicken into the final turn, gained the lead into the stretch and kicked clear under
intermittent handling. BACK ALLEY CAT chased leaving the backstretch, swung out four wide under urging and closed to take second. BABS DELIGHT
broke slow then picked up the chase through the backstretch, angled out at the head of the stretch and was edged out late. ROLL THE STONE raced in
second flight while two wide, was roused at the three sixteenth pole and closed gradually outside. MARACOCA'S DREAM set pace along the rail, was
overtaken nearing the stretch and gave way inside. HOLY MUCHACHO offered little. RYANWATER stalked five wide early, fanned three wide into the far
turn and had no response when called upon. SOUTHERN WARLORD settled off the early pacesetters, stopped with three furlongs remaining and was
eased. *It was reported by the Official Veterinarian has having SOUTHERN WARLORD bled.

SOMETHING ABOUT ME sat in striking range inside, lacked running room through the final turn, angled out sharply to the three path and won going away.
BLUSHING BROOKE sat off the early pacesetters, moved up alongside EVERYTHING'S QUIET to challenge the lead, edged away and was out kicked
through the stretch. SAVEITFORARAINYDAY lagged early, gained closer order under urging, shifted out into the stretch and rallied late to earn show.
FLORIST never far back outside, drifted in near the three sixteenth pole under right handed encouragement and flattened. EVERYTHING'S QUIET
contended the early pace inside of LIA'S ON TUNE, dueled to the three eighths pole then disposed of rival and gave way inside. LIA'S ON TUNE pressed
the pace outside, was unable to move on near the three eighths and wilted.

Footnotes
MISTER HENRY LEE settled in stride, angled out to the three path then was asked to quicken, closed steadily outside and was along in time. FROBISHER
BAY saved ground inside, angled to the rail nearing the three sixteenth pole and was out finished. BOOKIE showed the way through the backstretch, took
pressure leaving the backstretch, rallied inside and weakened in the final furlong. ALL UNDER CONTROL chased outside then bid leaving the three eighths
pole, moved up menacingly outside and was unable to improve through the stretch. FINALLY GOTTCHA raced in closest pursuit, moved up alongside
BOOKIE after the half mile to challenge the lead, rallied through the final turn and lacked the closing response needed. RUCK raced four wide, chased from
the rail into the lane and stopped.

Footnotes
TROOPER JENNY rated off the pace while four wide, bid approaching the quarter pole then prevailed under a drive. MISS MCFAD tracked inside under a
snug hold, swung out into the final turn, rallied outside of the TROOPER JENNY through the stretch then was out finished and just held for place. FLASHY
SISTER trailed the field, lacked running room in the final furlong inside then shifted out sharply and surged late but missed. LITTLE ROSALYN shifted out to
the four path through the backstretch, chased outside under encouragement and passed tiring rivals late. PEPPERMINT contended the pace inside of
VICTORY SHADOW, was overtaken at the head of the stretch and faded. SNEAKY SISTER lacked a serious bid. VICTORY SHADOW pressured the pace
outside and left nothing in reserve late.

ACE OF DIAMONDS saved ground while three wide, took closer order leaving the backstretch, came under coaxing into the final turn then rallied
determinedly inside and held on well. LONESOME CAT took back into the backstretch then raced in closest pursuit, drove four to five wide, angled out to
avoid LONE PIONEER into the stretch and held gamely for second. LONE PIONEER quickest to the turn, was under a strong hold into the backstretch,
showed the way to the far turn, bore out near the three sixteenth losing ground, kept on under steady handling and finished evenly. GUNN WITH THE WIND
reserved off the early pacesetters, launched a rail bid into the lane and flattened through the stretch. HUERFANO G. tracked four wide and failed to
threaten. STEELFORCE fractious in the gate then broke slow, trailed through the backstretch and offered a mild bid late. DOMENICO chased and lacked a
kick. PATRICK showed little.

SPIRE hustled away the prompted the pace inside, angled out to the three path nearing the three sixteenth pole, kept on gradually under steady urging and
held sway. CYCLONE DAN broke outward, raced from the back of the pack, swung out into the lane bumping NORM'S PLACE then rallied determinedly
outside and got up in the final strides for second. BIONIC BIRD set a pressured pace to the turn, repelled challenge from MYSTERIOUS PROMISE then
rallied determinedly through the stretch and weakened deep stretch. PACIORETTY reserved off the pacesetters while three wide, shifted out near the three
sixteenth and lacked the rally needed. IMPOSING CAT tracked inside, uncoiled a bid along the rail then gave way inside late stretch. MYSTERIOUS
PROMISE hurried outside then moved up menacingly to challenge the lead but lacked the closing response required. TIMELESS TALES gapped early and
passed tiring rivals. NORM'S PLACE raced four to five to the first turn and failed to menace. LOOKIECOOKIE stalked four wide early and tired with a furlong
remaining.

ORANGE THEORY fanned five wide into the opening turn, closed steadily outside and won the nod. GRADY'S SONG contested the early pace, drew away
into the lane and was run down late. GUARANTEEDDELIVERY sent for speed but was outsprinted to the turn, chased the leader into the lane and finished
evenly. PRINCESS SOIREE lugged out leaving the backstretch, chased inside then angled out to the three path into the stretch and closed late. FOREVER
JIMMY chased three wide and rallied belatedly. ALYS CODE vied outside, chased three wide then drifted out at the head of the lane and yielded. BAINE
THE BULL sat in striking range while four to five wide and was roused to no avail. REMAIN CALM steadied and was not a factor. DOCSLASTJOKE chased
outside, clipped heels near the three sixteenth pole and faded. THUNDER PRINCE chased throughout. BUFFALO BOYANN showed little.

Footnotes
MOROCCAN WARRIOR allowed to settle mid pack, moved up into striking range, roused four wide and won driving. INDICATIVE raced three wide through
the opening turn, sat in striking distance through the backstretch, moved up three wide near the three eighths pole to challenge the leaders, was overtaken
in the final sixteenth and held place. AZTEC KEY raced wide into the lane and closed well late. SMALL VICTORIES raced near the back early, circled the
field and was out kicked for show. BIG EGYPT raced four wide through the first turn, gained closer order leaving the backstretch and lacked the rally
needed. COURTLY PLEASURE vied outside, dueled to the five sixteenth pole outside of NEVERADOUBT and faded with two furlongs remaining.
NEVERADOUBT dueled for the lead, edged clear of rival and faded steadily. NEVER EVEREVER never reached contention.

Footnotes
SLEW'S BAK sat mid pack outside, fanned four wide into the far turn, advanced outside quickly gaining a slim advantage over SOLO RING into the stretch
and held under steady pressure. SOLO RING set a pressured pace under a snug hold, responded to looming threat at the head of the lane, dug in when
challenged and gave way grudgingly late. BACKSTREET BOBBY raced at the back of the pack, circled the field leaving the final turn and rallied belatedly
earning show honors. ZIPPITY ZAP saved ground inside, raced through traffic at the head of the lane and was out kicked. RACING RIVER stalked inside
under a snug hold, bid two wide near the three sixteenth pole and had little left in stretch. STORMCHASER sat in striking position from the five path, was
roused at the quarter pole and faded. INTENT TO STRIKE passed tiring rivals. TAP MASTER never far back in the four path and dropped back in traffic.
ROLLIN SEVENS offered little. TRIPLE POWER pressured the pace while three wide, was unable to move on with SOLO RING at the five sixteenth pole
and was eased with a furlong remaining.

Footnotes
DEVILS COMMAND stalked while racing along the rail, waited in traffic at the head of the lane, found running room between rivals mid stretch and edged
clear. HARRY'S HAMMER raced at the back of the pack early, advanced along the rail, lacked running room early stretch then took advantage of rail
opening up mid stretch and was out finished. TRIPLE LIVE led the field through the backstretch, responded to challenge from DITES MOI and was collared
mid stretch. WISER TIMES allowed to settle mid pack then shifted out to the three path, drove four wide and leveled off in drive. DITES MOI sat just off the
pace while two wide, moved up alongside TRIPLE LIVE to contest the lead, dueled under heavy urging approaching the stretch and weakened. SMILEY
tracked outside early, chased into stretch and was unable to improve position through the drive. SMALL TOWN DUDE sat in range outside and failed to
threaten. COMMISSION MAN saved ground from the three path and tired early. POOR RUBEN never reached contention.

Footnotes
SKY DESTINY raced five wide leaving the chute, tracked outside, asked to quicken through the far turn, drifted in under right handed encouragement after
the three sixteenth and continued to drifted late stretch then drove clear. HEREVERYWISH angled to rail into the far turn, was set down for a drive into the
lane, lacked running room in traffic then angled in sharply bumping HOLY HANNA and was along for second. LITTLE NEW YORK trailed early, swung out
at the quarter pole and closed steadily outside. MOE'SANNIE attended the early pace while three wide, chased the leader to the quarter pole then moved
up menacingly under urging and was narrowly denied for third. REBATE SHOP roused at the quarter pole and went evenly through the stretch. QUEEN'S
PARK tracked wide through the backstretch and lacked a closing response. HOLY HANNA broke alertly then vied for the early lead inside of DEW TELL,
lodged a rail bid nearing the three sixteenth pole, was bumped and yielded. TIGERINYOURTANK lacked a serious bid. PARIS IN PLAY lagged, circled wide
at the head of the lane and lacked a kick. DEW TELL vied for the early lead, drew away through the far turn, saw margins diminish nearing the quarter pole
and faltered. DANCING AWESOME offered little. SALTY O'DAY chased early and tired.
