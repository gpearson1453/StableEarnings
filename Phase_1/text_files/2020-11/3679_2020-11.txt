Footnotes
OFTEN ENOUGH was unhurried early, rallied in the stretch three wide, had a late burst and was along in time. REANIMATE was away alertly and quickly
made the lead, remained clear in mid stretch and was caught on the wire. GOLDEN AFLEET contended throughout and finished willingly in a good effort.
FASTEST MAX pressed the pace, rallied at the quarter pole and drew close, put in his bid and hung late. RANSOM THE BULL had good position
throughout and went evenly late. ROLLIN WAY OVER was unhurried early, rallied in the stretch and failed to sustain his bid. CHARLEE'S MAGIC was no
factor. CAPTAIN RILEY was no threat. PRADO COLORS flashed brief foot and was through early.
