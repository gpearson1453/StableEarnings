Footnotes
GATOR SHINING broke out slightly, tracked leader while bit off the rail, came three wide into the stretch, rallied from between rivals through the drive and
got up gamely while three deep on the wire. ENOUGH NONSENSE stalked early from along the rail, continued inside, steadied sharply in tight quarters just
outside quarter marker, dropped back some, angled out some, rallied from between rivals and inside the winner and narrowly missed in game effort.
GREGORY'S PRIDE settled off the leaders, chased two or three wide, tipped out further exiting the turn, battled outside winner and four wide through the
lane and lost a narrow decision. MAC DADDY TOO prompted the pace while outside leader to the bend, moved up and challenged entering the stretch,
gained advantage, angled in bit and could not hold off rivals late. CHASING FAME reserved while outside rival, continued two wide to the turn, lacked room
behind rivals on the bend, angled to the inside and went willingly to the wire. LANCE THE LEGEND was sent up from the inside to gain command, set pace
from the rail, relinquished control into the lane, fought back briefly from the inside but gave way in the final sixteenth. SAI CON (FR) settled inside, dropped
well back around the turn , was eventually eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
SUMMER LOVE sped clear and angled to the rail on the first turn, padded the lead around the second bend and stayed clear under right-handed urging.
INVINCIBELLA (GB) settled early near the fence, advanced inside rivals up the backstretch, chased the winner two wide into the lane and held the place.
REALREALGOOD trailed early on from inside, angled three wide on the far turn, drifted out in the lane and gained the show. HEART RIVER raced off the
pace while outside a rival, advanced two wide around the far turn, and kept on for a minor award. LA ROSA DRIVE stalked the lone leader from inside then
a bit off the rail, angled in around the far turn and saved ground into the stretch and failed to threaten. SAMANDAH went four wide through both turns and
came up empty. PASITO went five wide while outside foes on the first turn, entered the far turn five wide then moved down into the four path and was never
a factor. SAPPHIRE SILK stalked the pace outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and weakened.

BUY WAVE BUY off alertly and showed early speed, stalked the leader then moved up to press the pace. LAKAYA tucked inside early, saved ground into
the stretch, rallied and earned the place honors. ROSE'S CRYSTAL stumbled badly at the start, raced between rivals then lacked room and steadied a bit at
the three-eighths pole, steered out into the lane and produced a mild rally. PHOENIX TEARS set the pace under pressure from outside, lost command at
the five-sixteenths pole, drifted out in the lane and flattened. SLEW SOUTH raced a bit off the rail then moved into the two path, angled four wide around the
far turn and finished evenly in the final furlong. KEEP DANCING bit fractious in the gate, went three deep around the first turn, traveled four wide around the
second bend and lacked a rally. JAN JAN CAN stalked the pace near the inside, moved forward tugging early on the backstretch, angled out in upper
stretch and weakened. ENVY fractious in the gate, stalked off the rail, crowded in upper stretch and weakened. FOREVER FREE tracked outside a rival,

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT JAMBOREE fractious in the gate, raced mid-pack, angled four wide around the turn and ranged up three wide into the stretch, drifted in a bit in
the drive and wore down the runner-up. INTO VICTORY set the pace early, received some pressure near the halfway point then inched away from rival,
saved ground around the far turn, asked at the three-sixteenths pole, held a short lead over the winner through the lane but was overtaken in deep stretch.
GOTTA BE LUCKY stumbled leaving the gate, stalked near the inside, two wide into the lane, could not kick on with the top pair but finished well clear of
next rival. WITH A WHISPER traveled at the back of the field, stayed off the rail to the stretch and improved willingly. SLEW'S SCREEN STAR stalked the
leader off the inside, between rivals nearing the far turn, angled in around the second bend and weakened. NICOLE GRACE off slow to begin, stalked
outside a rival then three deep at the seven-sixteenths pole, moved out into the four path around the last turn and also weakened. MOREAVINO fractious in
the gate, bumped at the start, came out into the stretch and lacked a rally. ADRIENNE'S PROGENY bumped inside rival at the start, dropped back into the
far turn and was through early.

Footnotes
SEASIDE DANCER brushed leaving the gate, sped to the front, responded when challenged from outside, turned away MISS FLAWLESS in deep stretch
and held off the late rally from LUCKY PERIDOT in the closing moments. LUCKY PERIDOT bumped leaving the gate, stalked the pace inside, asked upper
stretch, rallied inside the winner and missed. HURLEY threw head and was off very slow, trailed the field to the far turn, went three wide into the lane, rallied
through the drive and finished a game third. QUINNIE stalked outside a rival, three wide leaving the far turn, tipped out in the lane, rallied but got outkicked.
MISS FLAWLESS (FR) forwardly placed in the beginning outside the leader, bid alongside at the quarter pole, challenged through the drive and flattened
out in deep stretch. LAKERBALL traveled along the inside, saved ground into the lane, failed to find a clear path and finished willingly. SUGARY bumped
leaving the gate, settled off the pace, angled four wide into the stretch, floated out at the eighth pole and failed to rally. PEACH TIME pulled early along the
inside through the first turn, tipped out into the two path around the far turn and lacked late punch. LEXINGTON GRACE (IRE) raced off the pace and
outside a rival, angled out on the second turn and came five wide into the stretch and lacked further response. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE
STEWARDS RULED THAT HURLEY CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS AT THE START BY THROWING HER HEAD WHICH CAUSED HER TO BREAK
SLOW AND IS RULED A STARTER.

JUST GRACE dueled for the lead inside a rival, chased that foe into the turn, raced outside a rival and three wide into the stretch, summoned a late bid and
overtook MAMA'S KID in the final moments. MAMA'S KID up close from inside, moved out into the two path on the turn, took command approaching the
eighth pole, held the lead through the final furlong but succumbed to the late bid from the winner. SENORADIABLO raced off the pace, took the turn three
wide, closed through the late stages and kept gaining to the wire. SYBIL'S KITTY dueled for the lead outside a rival, cleared into the bend and steered to the
inside, lost command nearing the furlong grounds and flattened out in deep stretch. HIT IT TWICE chased the top pair along the inside into the turn, exited
two wide and lacked a bid. MAJESTIC DIVA entered the turn along the inside, angled out around the bend and made no impact. ZILLINDA chased the
speed from off the rail, steadied off heels at the three-eighths pole, angled in on the turn and could not rally.

Footnotes
MUSAWAAT (GB) settled early, traveled two wide then bid three wide on the second turn, hounded CALI CALIENTE through the final furlong and wore
down rival to be up late. CALI CALIENTE set the pace inside, met bids around the far turn, resisted through the final furlong but was finally overtaken in the
closing moments. SALVATOR MUNDI raced two wide into the stretch for the first time then angled to the rail, pulled into the clubhouse turn, moved off the
inside on the backstretch, came three wide into the stretch, rallied and was gaining to the wire four deep late. MURAD KHAN (FR) stalked the pace from
inside, waited for room at the five-sixteenths pole, urged upon leaving the final turn, lacked room in upper stretch, angled in late and finished well up the
inside. KAZAN (IRE) angled in entering the stretch the first time, trailed the field to the far turn, angled out entering the lane for the final time and showed a
mild rally. UNTAMED DOMAIN steadied off heels entering the first turn, settled off the pace, checked off the heels MURAD KHAN in deep stretch and was
too late to regain momentum. CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE broke in and bit, settled off the pace, went four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. GRAY
MAGICIAN up close early outside the leader, showed a mild bid between foes but failed to kick on into the stretch and tired. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
RUTHIES RACER stalked the pace near the inside, bid inside the top pair leaving the turn, took over at the three-sixteenths and kicked clear in the late
stages. I'M THE BOSS OF ME chased the leader up the backstretch, bid three wide on the turn, shifted out at the three-sixteenths and could not match the
winner in the final furlong. DARING CAT traveled mid-pack early on, went five then four wide on the turn and bested the rest. BINGOS SYSTEM chased the
pace off the rail, angled in on the turn and kept on for a minor award. TEQUILA DIVA chased three deep early, came six wide into the stretch and showed a
mild response in the lane. YOU'RE ALL TALK chased between foes early, went five then three wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. GEMSTONE GAL off
slow to begin, traveled near the back of the field, angled out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. PAINT ME AGAIN sped clear of the field and angled in
some, traveled two to three wide around the turn, lost command into the stretch and gave way. AS REQUIRED bumped leaving the gate, raced mid-pack up
the backstretch, entered the turn six wide then moved down into the four path and never responded to urging. BREWED BIG off a bit slow to begin, dropped
back early, angled in on the turn and was never a factor. SMART LOLA broke in and bumped rival at the start, went five wide into the stretch and had little
left.

TEMBO hesitated and tossed head at the start in a poor beginning, trailed the field into the first turn, advanced up the inside then swung out into the stretch,
rallied alongside CANADIAN LUCK and drove past. CANADIAN LUCK tucked inside early stalking the pace, angled three wide on the second turn, took
over past the eighth pole but got outkicked by TEMBO in the late stages. C FALLS showed early speed from inside then steadied briefly at the three-quarter
pole, stalked outside the leader up the backstretch, bid outside at the five-sixteenths marker, took over shortly after and led into the stretch, lost command
inside the eighth pole, then held the show. MY INDY settled off the pace, advanced along the inside, tipped out into the stretch, raced between foes in upper
stretch and went evenly through the final furlong. FULL DRAW showed early speed from outside, cleared inside rival around the first turn, challenged
around the far turn and fought back inside to the stretch, then weakened in the drive. MEADWAY tossed head and came away to an awkward beginning,
lacked early speed, trailed the field to the far turn, bobbled past the quarter pole while angling out, came five wide into the stretch and improved position.
CAPO MAFIOSO in range early, traveled two wide then between foes, exited the far turn three wide and failed to rally. DRASARIO (IRE) raced off the pace
and outside a rival and proved no menace. RECREATE settled near the back of the field and never got involved. K P D DAY chased off the inside, four wide
into the lane and faded. HAND-TIMED.
