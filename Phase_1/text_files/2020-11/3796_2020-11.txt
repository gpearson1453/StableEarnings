of the stretch to take over inside the sixteenth pole and held on well under steady handling. SKI BUNNY settled off the pace in the three and four paths,
started a bid into the far turn and raced at the rail through the turn, then dug in down the lane to take second inside the sixteenth pole while outfinished for
the win. WITTY BANTER saved early ground while racing off the pace, bid angling outward on the far turn and left the turn about the seven path then
finished well outside. MARGIE'S HEAVEN broke a step slow then rushed up inside to rate the pace, came under pressure into the turn, was steadily
encouraged leaving the turn then weakened inside the sixteenth pole. M. J.'S LADY rounded the first turn about the five path and stalked into the
backstretch, bid entering the far turn and rounded the turn about the four path, though, weakened through the lane. WORSTBESTIDEAEVER saved ground
just off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole but flattened stride off the rail on the far turn. AWESOME JAZZ settled off the pace about the three path
the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the far turn, came through the far turn in the four and five paths and showed little further.

path into the turn, and showed little in the lane. POLISH COOKIE stalked outside, bid into the turn and raced in the five and six paths through the turn, but
proved empty down the lane. GRACE N FAVOR raced off the pace and outside then flattened stride about the five path of the turn. VANNA BELLE surged
clear and angled to the inside to rate the pace, was caught approaching the turn and faded abruptly through the turn.

Footnotes
ODDS ON broke in the air and inward, regrouped and stalked the pace wide through the backstretch, kept aim four wide on the turn, drew clear into the lane
and was steadily handled to hold on. NO MORE TALK chased the pace and rounded the turn at the rail, took aim into the stretch then dueled for second
while gaining on the winner. NOVA BOY was sluggish from the gate, hustled up then gave chase racing well off the rail, raced wide into the stretch and was
outfinished in the stretch duel for second. REGGIE'S BUDDY chased the leaders from the four and five paths then flattened stride leaving the turn. TAKE
YOUR PLACE gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn and passed some rivals in the lane. MORE ABUNDANCE chased the pace off the rail and
raced at a close disadvantage three wide on the turn, but dropped back into the lane and weakened. SUCCESSFUL ZIP was hustled along to set the pace
inside but gave up the lead leaving the turn and weakened inside the three sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
MISS LESLIE chased the pace through the backstretch but dropped back at the rail rounding the turn, recovered stride to surge to the lead a sixteenth away
and was steadily handled to hold on well. KEEPYOURSKATESON chased the pace and rounded the turn about the five path then dug in through the stretch
to get up for second later yards. DEW DAT was hustled along to set a pressured pace, raced clear into the lane but was caught a sixteenth away and
flattened stride later yards. COWGIRL NIGHT gave chase well back, rounded the turn six and seven wide and showed little more in the lane. APRILNESS
chased the pace outside and raced close in the three path of the turn then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. SHE'S ALL COURAGE saved ground turn.
CLASSY ESCORT gave chase and rounded the turn about the four path, then weakened. KRUBERA chased the pace and rounded the turn off the rail,
then weakened. CUE THE BAND was not a factor. KENS LADY gave chase through the backstretch and faded in the four path of the turn. USED TO BE
FUN saved ground. MYSTIQUE PALACE gave chase then faded in the three path of the turn.

LEWISFIELD chased the pace inside then rounded the turn about the three path, dug in for the lead a sixteenth away and held on well with steady
insistence. FIBER AND EMILY engaged in close chase and took the lead two deep approaching the head of the lane, but was caught a sixteenth away and
flattened stride a bit in later yards. REFORM SCHOOL gave chase and rounded the turn about the four path, angled to the outside in the upper stretch, dug
in under steady handling and finished well while gaining on the runner-up. W W SPRINGTIME chased the pace, raced near the rail on the turn then
weakened into the lane. LOST IN LIMBO gave chase, rounded the turn two deep then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. FREE DANCER was hustled
clear to set a pressure early pace, gave up the lead at the rail leaving the turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. SPIKES SHIRL gave only distant
chase.

Footnotes
HELLO HOT ROD surged to the front and set the pace inside, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, then dug in under steady encouragement to
draw away from ALL THREES, who was rated close and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, but started to give way leaving the eighth
pole. DR. FERBER gave chase while well off the rail, rounded the turn in the four and five paths and finished evenly. LADNEEDSAHANDLER gave chase
and rounded the turn near the rail then flattened stride inside the three sixteenths pole. WHAT THE FLASH gave chase and rounded the turn about the
three path, though showed little more in the lane. ALOYSIUS LUCK showed only mild response while widest on the turn. DELAWARE DESTROYER chased
the pace and rounded the turn near the rail, though showed little more. STEADY EDDIE was not a factor. NORDIC RHYTHM faded after three eighths of a
mile. WOODCHUCK rated close off the rail then faded through the turn. HUNTER JOE broke a step slow and raced off the pace inside then faded at the rail
rounding the turn.

Footnotes
PHANTOM RO took over to set the pace off the rail, raced clear on the turn and was steadily handled to show much the best. SOUND OFF chased the pace
and angled five wide into the stretch, dueled to take second in the vicinity of the eighth pole and had to settle for second best. JOHN'S PROMISE chased
the pace inside, rounded the turn off the rail then angled to the four path into the stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. LAWN BOY (GB) gave chase
inside and raced near the rail on the turn, though, flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. AMATTEROFTIME gave chase racing well off the pace and was
not a factor. AIR ON FIRE engaged in close early chase and rounded the turn about the four path then flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. FUTILE gave
chase outside, raced about the five path on the turn and showed little more. SINGANOTHERSONG gave chase inside then faded abruptly on the turn.

Footnotes
FIND YOUR BOAZ rated off the pace and off the rail the first turn and dropped well back leaving the turn, started a bid around the half mile pole and steadily
progressed in the five path of the far turn, then dug in from the head of the stretch to take the nod in the final strides. BRIGHTWOOD came away a step
slow and settled off the pace in the three and four paths, bid leaving the half mile pole, raced in range of the lead five wide on the far turn and dug in gamely
through the lane, but was outfinished the final strides. STEPHANOPOULOS settled off the pace in the three and four paths then bid at the rail into the far
turn, took the lead in the vicinity of the three sixteenths pole and dug in gamely to deep stretch before grudgingly ceding the final strides. NICKY BEAR
saved ground off the early pace then bid while angling out into the lane and was under all out handling to finish well. HINTING settled close off the rail then
picked up the chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and raced evenly to the sixteenth pole before flattening stride. BOURBON
AGOGO raced off the pace in the four and five paths and showed little response. KING PACAY stalked the earlier pace about the three path then took the
lead midway on the first turn, but steadied and was caught nearing the half mile pole, gave chase from that point then weakened inside the eighth pole.
ELUSIVE MOTION rated a slim early lead inside but was caught midway on the opening turn, recovered the advantage nearing the half mile pole, was
pressured at the rail through the far turn, drifted into the stretch, gave up the lead three sixteenths away and weakened the final furlong. TEMPTING
MOMENT rounded the opening turn in the four and five paths then stalked, though, faded leaving the far turn. COMPASS COURSE rounded the opening
turn in the five and six paths, raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response.
