Footnotes
DON'TTOUCHMYSTUFF saved ground stalking the early pace, eased back slight and was steered off the rail near half mile marker, raced between foes
taking the lead, opened a clear lead with a furlong to run and won under a drive. GROOVE raced outside, joined for command three wide on the
backstretch, raced between foes on the final turn then was left with the rail for the stretch run and gained place. MADELYN'S DANCER, just off the pace
and just off the rail, eased out and tried to split foes near half mile marker but steadied in tight, fell back a bit and moved to the outside on the final turn, took
up chase but had no late kick. AFRICAN SONG raced in the three path, eased out wider near stretch and was too late. OUR CLAIRE BEAR set the early
pace two wide then was left with the rail, stopped suddenly entering the stretch and was being eased. TWEETY KITTEN, far back and just off the rail, never
threatened and was also being eased through deep stretch. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF MADELYN'S DANCER AGAINST
DON'TTOUCHMYSTUFF FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE HALF MILE MARKER WAS DISMISSED.

Footnotes
THOMAS KNIGHT didn't break sharply but quickly established position racing three wide, took the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and held on under a
drive. DODDSPRIVATELABEL saved ground while not far back, moved out acing into the stretch and closed well. SLOT broke slowly but was quickly
hustled to the lead while saving ground, edged away near mid stretch and then held on tenaciously. COLORADO GRANDSLAM stalked the pace two wide
and held on well. BOLITA BOYZ broke slowly, saved ground throughout and was too late. COUNTY CORRECTIONS, very wide, failed to be a serious
threat. CATCH FIRE saved ground just off the pace then tired. DRAXHALL WOODS, outrun while inside, swung very wide into stretch and was no factor.
RIDE ON FAITH, very wide, showed little. THREATLOVESMIDNITE, wide and just off the pace, was finished after a half. VISIONARY RULER was well
placed between rivals, gave way leaving the turn.

Footnotes
CASEYOUDIDN'TKNOW didn't break sharply, saved ground throughout, closed determinedly and was along in time. ALEDA LUTZ saved ground in second
flight, split rivals in deep stretch and missed. PANTALONI raced wide and finished with good energy. NANCY B, slowest from the gate, saved ground,
steadied briefly on the far turn, moved out and rallied. VALERIE FIRST, outrun early, swung very wide into stretch and was too late. VALIANT SPIRIT, five
wide and just off the pace, moved in a bit and faded. IT'S A SHAW THING set the pace in the three path, extended her lead in mid stretch then faltered.
IWASBORNAWINNER saved ground just off the pace then tired. DANCINGTHEHNYDAWAY failed to menace. FROSTY FRIEND was extremely wide and
was never a facor. PASTICHE, four wide in second flight, tired badly.
