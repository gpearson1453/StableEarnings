Footnotes
POCKET TALK (IRE) performed a wire to wire victory with authority. SHOOTIST was rated towards the rear, rallied two fences out and closed ground for
second place. FIRST FRIDAY traveled up close throughout, was outfinished while in pursuit going into last fence yet stayed on gamely to claim third place.
SIDELING HILL mounted a challenge from fourth out to two out, then faded. WORZEL GUMMIDGE (IRE) was in a stalking position till four fences out, then
lost rider. EL JEFE GRANDE trailed and was pulled up. PAC YER TACK traveled mid pack, bid two fences out to drew within a length of the leader, then
stopped, dropped back and was pulled up. HAFAJAY (GB) raced just off the pace for the first mile, tired, dropped back and was pulled up. HIGHWAY
PRINCE (IRE) was always outrun, trailed and was pulled up. There was a stewards inquiry concerning apparent bumping of SHOOTIST and SIDELING
HILL when in close quarters at the second last fence, resulting in no change of order.
