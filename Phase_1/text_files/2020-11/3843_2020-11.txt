Footnotes
MISTY EXPRESS stalked then pressed the pace into the far turn, was asked for more soon after the three-eighths pole, gained a clear lead into the lane
and was ridden out while maintaining the advantage. QUIET CONTENDER was in the two path through the turn when never far back, bid into the lane but
could not gain on the top one while finishing well clear for the place spot. PRESCIENCE chased the pace from the two path through the turn, bid three wide
into the lane then then could not sustain the effort while settling for the distant minor share. TWILIGHT MAGIC was never a factor while racing near the
inside. ELUSIVE JUSTICE tracked the pace from along the inside into the far turn then faded. GOT SPIRIT set the pace into the far turn, was under
pressure in mid-turn then was suddenly done.

Footnotes
OFF SIXES was unhurried while off the inside, bid three and then four wide approaching the quarter pole, moved to the leader just outside the eighth pole,
dueled with that one and inched up late. WITCH DOCTOR stalked the pace from the three path into the turn, bid three wide near the three-eighths pole,
dueled with another into the lane, shook that one off but was immediately joined by the winner, dueled with that one through the final eighth and yielded late.
HYNDFORD tracked the pace from along the inside through the turn, bid from the two path into the lane, was a serious threat once straightened then could
not keep up with the top two. BOLD PROPHET pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, got rid of one dueler and was joined by then runner-up soon
after, stayed with that one into the lane then weakened. CACAHUETE was along the inside through the turns and never was a factor. MIDNIGHT SWAP
hustled out into the first turn to gain the lead, continued on a short lead approaching the far turn, continued to duel through mid-turn then was done.
CONFIDENTIAL raced in the two path through the turns and made no impact. PRAISE BE TO GOD was always far back while in the two path.

VERRY AMELIA chased the pace from the four path through the turn, moved four wide into the lane, was in the five or six path once straightened, was
under right and left handed urging through the final eighth and ran down the leader late. CECILIA'S HOPE was three wide into the turn to gain the lead,
cleared before mid-turn, widened the lead into the lane, continued clear inside the sixteenth pole and could not hold the winner safe. A TOUCH OF
JUSTICE chased the winner from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, could not gain on the top one and lost his place
spot. TAP THE LINE was in the two path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the three or four path, angled to the two path near
the sixteenth pole and gained mildly. ROYAL TO BE chased the pace along the inside through the turn and faded. PERFECT SMOKEY EYE was never a
factor while in the two path through the turn. SHES MY TREASURE was outrun while in the four path through the turn. SUMMER PICNIC was outrun while
in the two or three path through the turn.

RIVER ECHO (GB) set the pace while under pressure down the backstretch, cleared into the far turn, slowly widened through the turn and into the lane, was
under a singular right handed encouragement late while continuing to widen. ROCKY RUSH saved ground through the turn and into the lane, dueled with
another through the final eight for the place spot and just edged up late while not a threat to the winner. ARTEMUS EAGLE pressed the winner two wide
down the backstretch, chased the winner through the turn and into the lane, was not going to gain on the winner when engaged with another for the place
spot and could not hold that position. JARETH chased the pace from the two path for half and steadily lost ground.

SACRED KIKI BIRD set the pace from near the inside through the turn while under pressure, came into the lane from the two path and drew off through the
final eighth. WILLS DEFENCE pressed the winner two wide through the turn, was no match for the top one inside the eighth pole but kept on well to remain
clear for the place spot. HERE COMES DOC was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, gained momentum after straightening in the lane and
offered a mild bid for the show spot while not a threat to the top two. WING AND WHEEL was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the
three path and lacked a bid while losing the show spot late. YOU GO BOY saved ground through the turn and into the lane, continued along the rail through
the lane and lacked a closing bid. PASS THE BISCUITS chased then pressed the pace while three wide through the turn, swung into the lane from the five
path and tired. RICH KINGDOM was never a factor while in the four path through the turn. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER was in the four path through the turn

GALILEO'S ROCK vied for the lead along the inside of two others, continued to duel into the lane, inched up a bit with a furlong to go then cleared inside the
sixteenth pole. MACHO ALEGRE vied for the lead two wide through the turn and into the lane, was on near even terms with a furlong to go then could not
keep up but stayed on well to be clear for the place spot. SINGER MCGEE was along the inside through the turn, angled into the six path entering the lane,
continued under a drive while in mid-track and offered a mild rally. SUNSIGN was unrushed through the turn while in the two path, continued near the inside
into the lane and rallied belatedly. BAKER'S MAN was bumped around at the start, raced in two or three path through the turn, straightened in the lane from
the eight path and offered a mild gain. JENNSTONE was bothered at the start when bumped and forced in, hustled up to press the pace three wide into the
turn, continued a contender into the lane then weakened. ROCK N JUNE BUG chased the three rival duel through the turn and into the lane then tired.
EVEN MONEY steadily faded while in the three path through the turn. FLINT was outrun while in the rail to the three path through the turn. THE

Footnotes
STRONG TIDE was unhurried while near the inside into the far turn, came off the rail while advancing, bid three wide into the lane while bullying between
rivals in upper stretch, continued with good energy, cleared before the eighth pole and slowly widened. UPHOLD vied for the lead two wide through the turn,
shook off challenger entering the lane, could not go with the winner but kept on well to remain clear for the place spot. MAX EXPRESS was along the inside
through the far turn, came into the lane from the two path and moved up for the minor share. FLATTER HYMN chased the pace from the three path into the
far turn, continued close entering the lane while four wide, was still in good position with an eighth to go then weakened. CLASSY COWBOY was in the five
to the four path through the first turn, continued well off the inside into the far turn, swung five wide into the lane and lacked a closing bid. JOVA chased the
pace from the four path into the backstretch, settled back through the turn while still four wide, came into the lane from the five path then angled in late when
racing with tired ones. WHOLELOTACHOCOLATE was five wide through the turns, came six wide into the lane and lacked a response. TWO LAST
WORDS was bumped at the start, raced in the two path through the turns and never was a factor. MYSTERY UNBRIDLED vied for the lead into late turn
then faded along the rail through the lane. TOSS OF FATE was in the two path through the far turn and tired. UNBRIDLED BEAST was in the four path
through the far turn and lacked a response. OPERATION STEVIE trailed into the far turn, was pulled up near the three-eighths pole and was eventually
vanned off.
