Footnotes
EDDIE'S SISTER was away in good order to assume command, set all the pace from the rail to the stretch then kicked away to mid stretch but was under
steady urging while not switching leads to hold. LEMON DROP TINI had no speed, trailed to the half, made a bid two then three wide to the stretch and
closed steadily but too late. ZAHRA was allowed to settle to the second turn, shifted three wide for room then was making up ground belatedly. ONLY THE
FACTS pressed the winner three then two wide for six furlongs but was outrun in upper stretch and weakened. OLIVE YOU MORE had no speed, was well
wide throughout and not a factor. ROCKETANN stalked the winner from the rail to the second turn then got outkicked to the stretch and weakened.
ZAGRAH (GB) chased the pace three wide for five furlongs but was outrun on the second turn and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
BOUNDFORJAMAICA chased the pace to the turn, got forced four wide on the turn, rallied when set down, drifted in slightly nearing the sixteenth marker
then pushed to the front. DARLING DEMON set the pace in the two path to the stretch, responded to pressure to mid stretch then could not stall the winner
but held second. MIDNIGHT FLOWER broke off balance, was corrected and stalked the pace from the rail to the stretch, remained a threat through the
drive but was outfinished. PAPAYA had no speed, raced two then three wide to the stretch, was inside the winner and had to check off heels at the sixteenth
pole then finished steadily. SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE pressed the pace three wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then lacked the needed late
response.

Footnotes
LADY BREXIT never far back to the second turn, saved ground and followed LORETTA into the stretch, had smooth sailing inside that one in the drive and
rallied to the front. LORETTA set the pace from the rail to the second turn, battled determinedly after coming off the rail in upper stretch then was outfinished
for the win but gamely saved the place. ODESSA pressed the pace to the half, bid between rivals on the second turn, dueled to deep stretch then was
outfinished. UNCHAINING MELODY (GB) chased the leader to the second turn, rallied to contest for the lead three wide to the stretch, responded to mid
stretch but was weakening late. GOING TO SHABOOMS had no speed, raced off the rail on the second turn then tired in the drive. RUNNIN DIVA chased
the pace three wide for a half mile, gave way on the second turn and stopped in the stretch.

DO YOU HEAR THAT was pushed along early to attend the pace, dueled between rivals to the stretch, responded, inched clear to mid stretch then dug in
desperately late. EMMA'S DANCE attended the pace outside the winner and three wide to the stretch, got outkicked by that one to mid stretch but kept to
task and closed steadily to just miss. BOLD MISTRESS was chasing to the turn, circled rivals four wide to the stretch then also finished willingly but too late.
JASMINE CHIEFTAIN tracked the pace two wide to the stretch, was outrun to mid stretch but finished in a rally. SWEET KAELA bobbled at the break,
recovered but had no speed, saved ground then angled out for room in upper stretch and was gaining late. MAGGIE'S MAGIC hustled to contest the pace
from the rail to the stretch then got outkicked and weakened. RIGHTEOUSLY had no speed, was two then three wide on the turn then closed the gap
without being a serious menace.

Footnotes
CHARLIE'S A. T. M. settled mid pack to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch and held driving. LOOKIN'
SWEET had no speed, settled to the half, was also three wide to the stretch then closed willingly for the place. STYLE AWARD pressed the pace three
wide, pushed to the front on the second turn but could not hold off the winner in mid stretch and weakened. BRITE TAN chased the pace to the second turn,
circled four wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. SWEET RYAN was outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, raced four wide
to the stretch but never threatened. ENDLESS STORY checked soon after the start, trailed to the stretch and was not a factor. HOLA CHICA was chasing
for a half mile, raced two wide on the second turn but also did not rally when called upon. ARRIVEDERCI AMORE hustled to the front in a swift opening
quarter, tried to relax on the backstretch but was overtaken on the second turn and tired in the stretch.
