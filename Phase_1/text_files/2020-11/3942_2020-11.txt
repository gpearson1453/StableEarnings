Footnotes
MAJOR FRONTIER was outrun early inside, came three wide off the far turn, and closed strongly to overhaul the leaders from outside in deep stretch. KING
UHTRED got shuffled back considerably around the far turn, moved off the inside near the head of the stretch, and finished fastest of all outside. STAND
WITH MO came three wide into the stretch, rallied into second position just inside MAJOR FRONTIER past the sixteenth-pole, but was nipped on the wire
for the place. BOCA GUY raced four wide around the far turn, and offered a mild response to pick up the last major share. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) lodged a
four-wide bid near the quarter-pole, then flattened out through the drive. GOLOVKIN tracked the leaders three wide, bid between horses through the furlong
grounds, and was outfinished from there. TORETTO vied for command outside HONOR FACTOR, stayed on to mid stretch, and gave way. FAR AWAY
LOOK raced greenly five wide into the first turn, and made no impact. HIGH YIELD KITTEN bumped with HONOR FACTOR shortly after the start, stayed in
range two wide to the far turn, and tired. HONOR FACTOR bumped with HIGH YIELD KITTEN soon after the start, vied inside TORETTO early, and was
through soon after going a half-mile.

Footnotes
TIMEWON'TLETMEGO pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch, drew clear around the turn and held firm under left-handed urging. SPEARGUN
was bumped then pinched back at the start, made good progress inside around the turn, angled three wide near the quarter pole and finished willingly.
KICKS ON SIXTY SIX saved ground off the pace, continued on the left lead in the lane and was along for the show inside. COMPETITIVE HERO set the
pace along the rail, could not match strides with the winner around the turn and weakened in the lane. DANG IT broke a step slow, chased the pace two and
three wide and came up empty in the lane. MR TINGLES had brief speed three wide. KING TARZAN broke inwardly and soundly bumped SPEARGUN at
the start, raced three wide and was outrun.

Footnotes
I GET IT was bumped between horses at the start, lagged at the back for nearly six furlongs, circled five wide brushing with VIBURNUM coming off the far
turn, and finished with a flourish outside to go clear in the last 70 yards. VIBURNUM was unhurried early two wide, moved out three then four wide and
brushed with I GET IT while just inside that rival turning for home, and was up for the place outside. SWEET PEARL went up to get the lead first time
through the stretch, responded when hooked from outside by AGOG into the lane, and stayed on to the sixteenth-pole before giving way. AGOG prompted
the pace, challenged outside SWEET PEARL reaching even terms through upper stretch, and was outkicked between horses. HAPPY CONSTITUTION
became edgy in the gate prior to the start, lunged inward bumping I GET IT at the break, stayed close for six furlongs, and weakened in the drive.
MASHUGANA bumped with I GET IT at the start, saved ground on the turns, and had no rally. FEARLESS IDEAS raced two to three wide on the turns, and
tired after six furlongs.

Footnotes
OCEAN RIDE broke slowly, advanced inside down the backstretch, reached the front near the half-mile pole, bumped with TOSCANITO entering the turn,
dueled inside of that rival to upper stretch, kicked clear nearing the eighth pole and held off a late challenge. EMPEROR'S CAUSE broke inwardly and
bumped RABDAN at the start, saved ground off the pace, closed up the rail and was gaining late inside of the winner. MAXIM MOMENT was urged along
down the backstretch and while racing two wide around the turn and could only gain slightly through the stretch. AMERICAN DOLLAR was pinched back at
the break, raced four wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied belatedly. GODS PROMISE failed to menace while racing two
wide. TOSCANITO sped out to a clear lead soon after the start, bumped the winner entering the turn, vied two wide to upper stretch and weakened.
RABDAN was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide and faded.

Footnotes
KEEP QUIET (FR) was unhurried early inside, began moving four wide around the far turn, rallied to overtake the leaders into the final furlong and drove
clear. BASHA hit the left side of the gate and steadied back at the start, trailed inside early, moved out three wide on the far turn still well behind, shifted
further out for the drive and finished well to get up for second. DONJI prompted the pace outside TWENTY FOUR SEVEN, stayed on to the furlong grounds,
and brushed with PHILO while weakening in deep stretch. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN set the pace inside to mid stretch, and brushed with PHILO while giving
way late. PHILO advanced three wide after six furlongs, loomed a threat through the lane, and was brushed late between horses while being outfinished.
GOLDEN SPEAR saved ground much of the way, and lacked the needed response. ICE TEA raced in striking range for six furlongs, and tired through the
stretch inside. ALIEN INVASION raced two wide, and was finished before completing six furlongs.

LA GATA NEGRA was off slow, made good progress two wide around the turn, bulled through between rivals in upper stretch, swept to command leaving
the eighth pole and powered clear late. NATURELL (ECU) pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, led past the eighth pole but had
no answer for the winner in the final furlong. MADAME MOON lacked early speed, raced two wide around the turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch and
was along for the show. QUEEN LETIZIA was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. CAPTURED LIGHT was bumped
at the start, chased the pace inside, angled out in upper stretch and faded. MARICOPA failed to menace while racing four wide. FIERY PRINCESS was
bumped at the start, set the pace along the rail and tired in the drive. NEW YORK COMMANDER was bumped at the start, and played no further factor
while racing three wide. LOOKN FINE AS WINE was outrun inside.

Footnotes
PRETENDANT settled in the second flight four wide approaching the backstretch, remained out in the course rallying into the stretch, overhauled the
leaders from outside late and edged clear. BAD BOY E. J. saved ground advancing after six furlongs, challenged outside BABY BROTHER in upper stretch,
swapped leads several times and saved the place. BODIE CODY bumped with YADI midway on the far turn, and rallied between horses to get the show.
PROSPECT PROJECT was outrun early, raced four to five wide coming off the far turn, and was going well belatedly on the far outside. BEE MAJOR was
three wide early, moved in from the two-path turning for home, and did not have enough. BABY BROTHER set an even pace inside to the stretch, and gave
way through the last sixteenth of a mile. D. SILO was outrun for six furlongs, improved position through upper stretch and ran on evenly late. YADI was
three wide into the far turn, bumped with BODIE CODY, bobbled and took up sharply near the five-sixteenths, regrouped and finished up evenly. TIZ LUNA
raced two to three wide in range for six furlongs, and tired in the stretch. IMA COALMAN lagged well back early, and made no headway four to five wide
leaving the quarter-pole. MIKE IS READY was no factor three wide. ROBIN TEAM SHOW prompted the pace outside BABY BROTHER, and faltered soon
after going six furlongs.

ROCK WITH ROBIN set the pace in the two path and drew off under a mild drive. MISS ITALY chased the pace two wide, angled to the rail near the
five-sixteenths pole and finished willingly to be clearly second best. HEART OF GOD lacked early speed, raced two wide and was along for the show.
HOKKAIDO saved ground in range, made progress around the turn, angled three wide and was roused near the five-sixteenths pole and came up empty in
the lane. HOPE LADY had early speed three wide and tired in the lane. PRETTY LIDDIE was in tight at the start, raced four wide and never threatened.
MAK HERO hit the starting gate, saved ground and was never involved. STRUTTIN raced four wide and was through early.

Footnotes
PROJECTED (GB) went along covered up behind the leaders, bid along the hedge through mid stretch and edged away under good handling. MY POINT
EXACTLY bumped with MACAGONE at the start, prompted the pace outside MID DAY IMAGE, and stayed on gamely. MID DAY IMAGE went up to get the
lead and moved inside entering the first turn, set an even pace to the stretch, and weakened late between the top two. UNCLE CURLY raced three wide on
the turns, and lacked the needed closing bid. AMERICAN NINJA raced two to three wide around the far turn, moved inside improving position after six
furlongs, but needed more. MACAGONE bumped with MY POINT EXACTLY at the start, moved up mildly through the middle stages, but flattened out. HOT
AND HEAVY was no factor through an inside trip. HONEY DONT raced well back into the far turn four wide, and made no impact. FARLEY checked sharply
heading to the first turn near the back, and remained outrun. MAJESTIC LUNA was never prominent.

Footnotes
DILIGENT was bumped at the start, tracked the pace two wide, bid three wide nearing the lane, took a short lead in upper stretch, battled outside of two
foes to deep stretch and drove clear late. CALL BROS broke out and bumped the winner at the start, stalked the pace inside, got through turning for home,
reached near even terms in midstretch, battled on while skimming the hedge and was second best late. SCOTCH WHISKEY was bumped soon after the
start, set a pressured pace along the rail, continued to lead in the two path around the far turn, vied between foes through much of the lane and was
outfinished. KARAMOJO pressed the pace two wide for a half, dropped back around the far turn, came four wide into the lane and had a mild re-rally. ON
DUTY was rank and pulling around the first turn, dragged the rider forward between rivals down the backstretch, went four wide around the far turn and
finished evenly. MY CHITU was outrun inside. ELBRUS failed to menace while racing three wide. SIERRA CAT was outrun while racing four and five wide.
ULTRACONFIDENT played no factor while racing five wide around both turns. CHANELIN steadied entering the first turn, raced three wide and was through
after a half. Due to a timer malfunction, the fractions were unavailable and the final time was hand-timed.
