was left with rail, rallied three wide into and took the lead near mid stretch but couldn't last. SIGHT LINE saved ground, eased out on the final turn, raced
four wide into stretch and rallied late. MANTLE, racing outside winner, fought gamely but weakened late. MARTINI KID was three wide and tired.

Footnotes
MIAMI TIGER saved ground dueling, shook loose on the final turn, opened a huge lead stretch and won under mild handling. SALSA'S RETURN, two wide
while unhurried, found room along rail entering the stretch and gained place. STORM TALES was very wide and failed to menace passing faders. STORMY
JUSTIN, just off the rail, steadied lacking room entering the backstretch, eased out and raced just off the pace before tiring. DIAMOND SQUARE dueled for
command two wide, drifted out on the final turn and into stretch and tired. HIGH FLYING GUY joined for command three wide then tired.
HOWBOUTDEMPATS swung out entering the first turn, remained wide and was outrun. YEAR OF THE KITTEN showed little. BRILLIANT RICHIE was four
wide dueling for the early lead then stopped.

JUST A THOUGHT set the pace racing with a clear early lead, responded when challenged turning for home, dug in gamely inside and held well in the final
furlong under urging. BEREN stumbled at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace, made a four wide run at the quarter pole, rallied outside in the stretch
drive and got up for second. MARVALOUS MIKE chased four wide early, three wide on the turn, rallied passing the quarter pole, bid willingly in upper
stretch, then was outkicked. SMOKUM PEACE PIPE was bumped at the start, chased three wide, raced between rivals on the turn and weakened. LOUIE'S
LAW was bumped at the start, chased between rivals, was in tight and forced to check sharply at the seven sixteenths marker and dropped back. DAKOTA
OUTLAW chased inside, raced inside on the turn and tired. JAMMIN JAMIE raced off the pace inside and did not factor. O'BRIEN raced off the rail and was
outrun. After a Stewards' Inquiry, the race was declared official.

POPIZAR saved ground to near stretch, swung out racing into and through stretch, closed determinedly and was along in time. FIX ME A SANDWICH set
the pace just off the rail, remained clear through deep stretch but was nailed near the wire. APPEALING FUTURE raced between foes and just off pace,
drifted in slightly mid stretch, was straightened and just held show. CREDIT CYCLE broke slowly, saved ground to stretch, swung out and rallied too late.
LEITONE (CHI) raced wide and dropped back. PHISH FAN saved ground in second flight then tired. STRONG BREEZE, three wide and well placed,
dropped back on the turn. LUXURY SUITE showed nothing.

Footnotes
FINISHING SCHOOL dueled for command inside, shook loose near mid stretch and held safe under pressure. ROBIN'S DESTINY steadied after the start
and was far back early, split rivals on the final turn, moved out very wide into and through stretch and finished well. JUMPIN JETT fractious in the gate, well
placed two wide, drifted out, finish. MISS AL DILA saved ground to near stretch, split foes and rallied late. BIG RED SEVEN, fractious in the gate, saved
ground to stretch then swung wide and lacked a strong closing kick. HALLUCINATION raced in the four path while unhurried, passed tiring foes.
VOLODINA, never far back, challenged three wide on the far turn then gave way. ENCHANTABULL saved ground just off the pace then tired.
DESCARADO, four wide, failed to menace. TRAPPE ME LATER, very wide, stopped. ENIGMATICA dueled for command lapped on winner then had
nothing left.
