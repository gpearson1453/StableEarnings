Footnotes
MISS MIAMI stalked the pace two wide, seized command in upper stretch, drew clear while getting out badly through the lane and ending up near the
outside hedge. DAHLONEGA raced in range outside, went four wide around the turn, dropped back some in upper stretch then rallied late to gain the place
in deep stretch. NOT NICE settled off the pace while racing two wide, bid between foes in midstretch, switched back to the left lead late and flattened out.
SWEETLY MAID saved ground off the pace for three furlongs, swung four wide near the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. SUGAR BOLT set the pace
along the rail, was collared in upper stretch and tired. SPEED STAR was outrun while racing two wide. ALPILLES stalked the pace in the three path,
checked in upper stretch and retreated. GLORY ROLL hopped at the start and made little impact while racing three wide.

Footnotes
BLESSED JOURNEY pressed the early pace between horses, challenged outside NEW YORK STYLE after six furlongs, got brushed and pushed out by the
latter past the three-sixteenths, continued to get floated out through the furlong grounds, received a light bump late and was able to get up. NEW YORK
STYLE set an even pace inside, dug in when BLESSED JOURNEY ranged up turning for home, shifted out brushing that rival in upper stretch, continued to
drift out under heavy left-hand pressure eventually making contact again late, and was worn down in the closing yards. CAN'T HAVE ENOUGH broke
inward, trailed inside for a half-mile, shifted off the rail approaching the stretch, and was along for the show without threatening. SHARETHEBLAME lacked
the needed response from the two-path. EXCALIBUR saved ground to no avail. ROBIN TEAM SHOW raced three wide and was finished before reaching
the stretch.

NURSE JUDY tracked the pace three wide, closed determinedly and was up in the final strides. TAKE ME AS I AM set the pace along the rail, repulsed a
bid from VENEZUELAN TALENT near the sixteenth pole but was unable to withstand the winner's late charge. VENEZUELAN TALENT pressed the pace
two wide, bid between foes in deep stretch but switched back to the left lead late and was outkicked. BAHAMIAN RHAPSODY chased the pace inside and
lacked the needed rally. NOT TONIGHT BOBBY failed to menace while racing two wide. LIL'S KITTEN was outrun while racing three wide. SANGFROID
never threatened while racing two wide. LA GUERRERITA was outrun inside. PRIZE PORTRAIT lost contact early, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
I KICKN pressed CHILL HAZE from outside, took over at the top of the stretch, and widened while kept busy. CHILL HAZE set the pace inside, was no
match for the winner turning for home, weakened staying on his left lead and was able to hold the place. LORD MELBOURNE raced three wide around the
turn, ran on one-paced through the lane and was much best of the others. STOPIT went evenly inside and lacked a bid. GRAN PATRON broke two lengths
slow, and was outrun three wide. SALTO DEL SABIO (CHI) was no factor two wide. BOSTON BEAST hesitated at the start coming out several lengths
slow, and was never close. The five-eighths fraction was hand timed.

Footnotes
BROOKES ALL MINE vied outside down the backstretch, drew clear and angled in entering the turn, extended the advantage inside around the bend and
drew off under a drive in the lane. ASSUME CONTROL was off a bit slow, advanced inside down the backstretch, was shuffled back entering the turn,
angled four wide nearing the three-eighths marker, advanced outside and was clearly second best in the lane. LIL MISS HOTSHOT had early speed,
chased two wide around the turn, weakened in the lane but held on for the show. HANNAH CATHERINE lacked early speed, raced three wide around the
turn and passed tiring rivals. DARLINDIVA was bumped a the start, advanced outside down the backstretch, chased three wide into the turn and faded after
a half. KWAINA had brief speed outside and retreated in the five path around the turn. CILINGA (MEX) was bumped at the start, raced two wide and was
through after a half. ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA had brief speed inside.

TWIRLING STAR pressed the early pace three then two wide around the turn, took over outside STEAL THE STARS in upper stretch, and drove clear.
SUMMER RETURNS hit the left side of the gate at the start, was ridden along making little headway on the turn three wide, stayed on task through the lane
and was up outside for the place. STEAL THE STARS set a pressured pace inside to the stretch, and weakened. LIPSLIKECHERRIES (GB) hit the left side
of the gate at the start, saved ground and failed to seriously menace. ANYTHING GOES bumped with BLESSING MEMORIES at the start, and posed no
threat. MY ASHLEIGH raced two wide, and lacked the needed bid. BLESSING MEMORIES bumped with ANYTHING GOES at the start, pressed the pace
outside for three furlongs, and tired.

Footnotes
EXCHANGE DAY set the pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and drew off under a drive. SWAGGY GEORGE was bumped at the
start, prompted the winner two wide, was no match for that foe in the lane but stayed on to be a clear second. TOP BOSS was forced in at the start, made
progress in tight quarters at the rail down the backstretch, was bumped into the rail nearing the half-mile pole, dropped back sharply, got back on track
entering the turn, saved ground around the bend, tipped out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and was along for the show. HEAVENLY
BLESSING broke inwardly, chased the pace two wide, pushed TOP BOSS into the rail nearing the half-mile pole, angled in to save ground around the turn
and lacked a closing bid. FITZ'S MO failed to menace while racing four wide. MR TINGLES was forced in at the start, raced two wide and never threatened.
VALIANT THOR was bumped at the start, had brief speed three wide and retreated.

Footnotes
STARSHIP MALLOMAR saved ground reserved in easy striking range to the top of the stretch, moved off the rail to go after ROSA STAR, collared that rival
leaving the furlong grounds and edged clear. PUGILIST bumped with DYNATOWN at the start, raced three wide in the second flight to the lane, and
finished well outside. ROSA STAR set the pace inside to the stretch, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. BARONESS VONTRAPPE raced well
back near the inside for better than a half-mile, rallied between horses through mid stretch and finished with interest. PARDON MY HEART lagged well back
to the far turn inside, swung wide for the drive and gained belatedly. LADY PANDA was outrun to the far turn, shifted out four wide approaching the stretch,
and made up ground without threatening. O'MALLEY stayed in range three wide early, lodged a bid in upper stretch but flattened out late. DYNATOWN
bumped with PUGILIST at the start, and was no factor. SCATNAP worked her way to the two-path early, stayed in the hunt to upper stretch, and was
outkicked from there. CLASSY OF COURSE was four wide on the first turn, and could not seriously menace. TWILIGHT broke slowly, and was never close.
AMADORA pressed the pace outside ROSA STAR early, and faltered in the stretch.

early speed inside, steadied entering the turn, continued to save ground around the bend, angled out in upper stretch and finished well.
RESERVENOTATTAINED raced off the pace inside, steadied near the half-mile pole, swung out nearing the lane and rallied for the show. DOC AMSTER
set the pace two wide between foes to midstretch and weakened. MOZO BELLO lagged well back outside, raced three wide around the turn, angled in in
upper stretch and improved position. IKEISGREAT stalked the pace four wide, bid nearing the lane but faded through the lane. MAN OF HONOR had early
speed between rivals, checked entering the turn, angled out to race four wide around the bend, came six wide into the lane and lacked any further response.
