BLACKOUT (FR) tracked pacesetter from along the fence, shifted out in upper stretch, bid outside MR. LOVEJOY then gained advantage past sixteenth
pole, inched away and won bob on the wire over outside rival. MYSTERY MESSENGER content to chase early from the inside into and on the turn, swung
out three then four wide for room entering the stretch, rallied furiously from the outside, poked his nose in front one stride before the finish but lost the bob
on the wire while three deep. MR. LOVEJOY broke in slightly, sped to front while securing the inside, edged away in upper stretch, dug in approaching the
wire but could not hold top pair. HIT THE SEAM stalked while outside winner, continued on two path into turn, came out further into the stretch, was inside
runner-up in upper stretch but lacked needed late punch. ANNIE'S BOY pressured the pacesetter from outside that foe, remained two wide to the stretch,
dropped back and weakened late from the inside. PORTANDO was forced in bit leaving the gate, chased inside, came off the rail exiting the turn and failed
to threaten.

EXTRA HOPE quickly stepped to the front, carved out fractions while slightly off the rail and well in hand to last turn, responded when challenged into the
lane, edged away under urging and safely held. MIDCOURT was bumped sharply by inside rival leaving the gate, recovered and moved up to press the
pace outside winner, continued on same path to final turn, under asking and edged closer to lead late on that turn and went willingly outside winner to the
wire. COMBATANT prominently placed early from the inside, received a rail-hugging trip tracking the pace, roused on the second turn, then weakened some
in the late going. ROYAL SHIP (BRZ) stumbled to his nose then sharply bumped outside rival nearing unseating rider at the start, gradually made up deficit
while two wide to the second turn, remained bit off the rail and weakened some in the final furlong.

finished willingly outside winner. CANADIAN GINGER flashed good early foot, set pace while slightly off the fence, remained on two wide path to the stretch,
relinquished control a furlong out and weakened from the inside. FLYING BUSINESS broke in bit and brushed with inside rival at the start, hugged rail

Footnotes
KERSHAW content to chase pace from the outside, continued three wide into second bend, moved up briskly four wide around that turn to gain command,
angled over and quickly cleared and proved best under one tap of whip and steady hand pressure. BOLD ENDEAVOR led other pursuers while two wide
into backstretch, remained off the rail then three wide leaving last bend, shook free from others and safely held second. CHAMPAGNEONME stalked from
along the fence to the second turn, checked momentarily passing quarter marker, found clear path along the rail in upper stretch, responded and rallied for
the show. POPULAR KID was bit tight from between rivals into initial turn, settled between rivals then inside winner on the backstretch and weakened some
in later stages. PROMISE NOTHING saved ground chasing the pace, angled three wide on the second turn, came out further entering the stretch and
lacked late response. MONGOLIAN LEGEND reserved from off the rail, was caught four then five wide on the second turn and into the lane and failed to
threaten. HE'S THE REASON angled over while assuming control into first turn, set pace to midway on second turn, had little resistance for the winner and
weakened from between foes in the lane.

Footnotes
MAC DADDY TOO came in shortly after the break and stepped to the front, dictated fractions from inside, responded when challenged into lane and shook
free then just held late threat from outside rival. ENDLESS SUNSET was forced in after the start, saved ground chasing the pace. came out bit on second
bend, tipped out three wide in upper stretch, rallied strongly from between foes and just missed nailing the winner. EL JOY was also forced in some after the
start, stalked from the inside, continued prominently from between foes into the stretch, shifted out past eighth pole and finished very willingly from inside the
runner-up. LABOR UNION drifted out some early on the first turn, came back in slightly then steadied off heels of BY MOONLIGHT later on that bend,
dropped back then advanced from off the rail, caught five wide into the stretch and finished with interest from the far outside. BY MOONLIGHT forced the
pace outside leader, remained on two wide path and prominent into the stretch but weakened some in the lane. IVORY SKY was forced in some shortly
after the start, reserved along the fence, shifted out in upper stretch and did not menace. FLASH OF GLORY caught four wide into first turn then fanned out
bit further later on that bend, moved up three wide, loomed to second turn and later weakened. MARCONIS was off bit slow, chased five wide into first turn,
remained off the rail and also weakened.

Footnotes
CAERULEAN was off alertly then taken just off the pace, prompted the early issue outside leader, moved alongside that rival into the lane, reached front a
furlong late, edged away and safely held. JOHNNY PODRES hugged the rail while chasing the leaders into the stretch, shifted out nearing sixteenth pole,
surged and was up in final strides for the place. HARTEL rushed up from between rivals to grab early command, set pace from the inside, was overtaken
passing eighth marker, continued inside and lost second in final yards. KRIS' WILD KAT tracked leaders from along the fence, angled out passing quarter
marker, came out further in upper stretch, closed late and just missed getting up for the show. CUNNING MUNNINGS was off step slow, raced three deep
to the bend, continued on three then four wide path into the stretch and did not threaten. COMBAT ZONE chased three wide then outside rally, caught four
wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed response from off the rail in the stretch. SEVERIN between rivals into and early on the turn, remained two or
three wide to the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BRACE FOR IMPACT contested the early issue from the inside, gained slim advantage approaching the turn, edged away under asking in upper stretch
and held off late bid of SCARY FAST SMILE. SCARY FAST SMILE bumped with inside rival leaving the gate, chased outside, moved up four wide around
the turn, loomed on same path into the stretch, came in slightly and whittled gap on winner late. STARSHIP CHEWBACCA settled inside, hugged rail
traveling around the turn and into the lane, came out slightly through the drive and bested rest. CHIPPER tracked leaders from between foes, continued on
two wide path, lacked room in upper stretch, finally angled out for room later in the drive and finished with interest. LIL RICHARDS BELLO bumped with
outside foe at the start, dueled or forced the pace outside winner, continued two wide to the lane and weakened in the drive. SQUARE ROOT stumbled to
his nose leaving the gate, dropped well back and angled over, saved ground to the turn, came out four wide into the lane and was no threat. SHOULD BE
ILLEGAL showed good early foot, prominent while three deep, continued three wide on the turn, was in bit tight from between rivals leaving the bend,
dropped back and weakened.

Footnotes
ACKER content to chase from off the rail, continued three wide to final bend, remained patiently handled from between foes into the stretch, roused then
split rivals, surged from the inside, gained lead past sixteenth and held off late bid of JUSTIN'S QUEST. JUSTIN'S QUEST settled inside, saved ground
tracking the pace, was two wide on the final bend then three wide into and lane and finished with a flurry to narrowly miss outside winner. GOLDEN
DOUGHNUT stalked from off the rail, remained three wide, moved up around the last turn, challenged three deep nearing top of the stretch, reached front,
spurted clear but could not off top pair. FRENCH GETAWAY reserved along the rail, angled out three wide on the final turn, came out further entering the
stretch and finished strongly from the far outside. WORTHY TURK chased two wide or between foes to the final turn, shifted out three then four wide leaving
that bend and improved placing late. CONTAGION chased bit off the fence, remained two or three wide then between rivals, caught four wide around the
last bend and five wide into the lane and never seriously menaced. SKY CONFIDENTIAL was sent to the front early then extended lead into the
backstretch, held uncontested lead to final turn, overtaken nearing top of the stretch and weakened inside. SWAMP SOUFFLE led pursuers early, moved up
from just off the rail, bid between foes on the final bend and also weakened from the inside. COLOSI three deep early, remained off the rail chasing the
leaders, raced four wide around the last turn and five wide into the lane while no late factor.
