Footnotes
SHACKQUEENKING broke sharp and disputed the pace between rivals and under a rating, secured command past the five eighths, handled outside
pressure around the second turn, responded when roused entering the lane and spurted away, wandered outward from left handed stick work in the final
furlong and held firm. RIPPOLINO vied inside a pair of rivals and held a slim lead into the backstretch, maintained a forward position as the leading pair
went on with it mid way through the backstretch run, came back along the rail in mid stretch and finished gamely to be clear of the rest. FLIGHT MAP , with
the pace three deep, prompted the pace outside the winner from the five eighths to the quarter pole, failed to match strides while four wide past the three
sixteenths, but churned on with some interest to get the show. ERIC'S EMPIRE , fractious in the gate, was backed out, examined and re loaded, rated along
between rivals while in range, moved up into the lane, chased and flattened out late. GOLD FELLOW lost ground four to five wide, was under a solid ride
pursuing into the lane but came up empty. CAMP PENDLETON unseated his rider when unruly in the gate, was backed out and checked over, broke
outward and soundly bumped with ERIC'S EMPIRE, corrected and stalked inside, faded under pressure into the lane and shifted out.

Footnotes
SUPER DANCER prompted the pace between rivals early on, was put to a ride to maintain position past the three eighths, seized command under a drive
with a furlong to go, kicked clear then held sway when geared down through the final fifty yards. RATIFY advanced inside foes nearing the five eighths,
rated in the clear leaving the far turn, shifted out for a clear run near the three sixteenths, straightened and finished with good energy to gain the place.
JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ took over early, dropped towards the rail and set a rated pace, held a clear lead under asking past the quarter pole, relinquished the
advantage in mid stretch then weakened late. GALILEAN MOON broke outward and bumped with a foe, eased back soon after, edged up while saving
ground leaving the half mile marker, came out to work between runners mid turn, pursued five wide into the stretch but flattened out. SUPER HOUDINI ,
bumped at the break, stalked the early pace off the rail, was under a ride mid turn, shifted in leaving the quarter pole and came up empty. FIRECALL
tracked the leaders three to four wide, failed to kick on past the quarter pole and weakened. CRYING FOR MORE , four wide, was in range under a ride
past the five sixteenths, lacked a kick leaving the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
DIVINE INTERVENTIO saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, found room along the inner rail to challenge for the lead in upper stretch and drove
clear late. DRILL'S LI'L MAN set the pace along the inner rail on the turn, drifted to the two path entering the stretch and gave way grudgingly. KINGSTON
PIKE lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. GLENGAR , five wide on the turn, weakened.
SMOKIN HOT FACTOR raced between horses throughout and failed to be a late factor. CAUSE HE'S WESTERN , three wide between horses into the turn,
weakened approaching the stretch. KEEPING THE PEACE prompted the pace outside DRILL'S LI'L MAN and gave way. ROCK SOLID GOLFER , in the
four path between horses leaving the backstretch, retreated after a half mile.

Footnotes
REVOLUTIONARY ROAD , keen to go between rivals while stalking into the turn, bid outside the leader mid turn, took over without much asking entering
the lane, kicked clear under a drive inside the three sixteenths, widened a furlong out then held sway while kept alert. EXTRA MEDIUM broke a step slow,
raced off the pace while saving ground, angled out, rallied between foes inside the sixteenth pole and just got the place. JUNGLE WARRIOR lacked speed
while off the rail, angled further out mid turn, circled five wide into the stretch, rallied in tandem and outside JUNGLE WARRIOR and just missed second.
PASCAL CHANT rated in the clear past the three eighths, advanced between runners into the lane, emerged as the closest pursuer in mid stretch then
flattened out. D C FIREMAN had speed inside to lead early on, was displaced after a furlong, stalked around the turn, came out for the drive but came up
empty. DRAGON MOON , three deep stalking into the turn, chased four wide under a ride into the lane and faded in the final sixteenth. FERNWOOD DRIVE
bid two wide to take command after an eighth of a mile, spurted clear into the turn, was joined past the three eighths, vied into the lane then weakened in
mid stretch. FIVE CARD DRAW , brushed at the break, raced off the pace and off the rail, was under a ride four wide into the stretch but failed to recover.
BRIDOLOGIST , four wide, gave way.

Footnotes
JOVIS tracked the leader two wide, went on the attack mid turn, dueled and took a short lead entering the lane, continued the battle past the furlong
grounds, shook clear under a drive with a sixteenth to go, remained on his left lead and prevailed. CERULEAN SPRINGS broke a step slow, lagged off the
pace, raced two wide into the lane, leveled off past the eighth pole, split rivals with a bold run and gained. SEANY P stalked the pace three wide, raced four
wide under coaxing into the lane, had aim in mid stretch but failed to seriously sustain. WONDER IN sped clear soon after the break, set the pace towards
the inside, was joined mid turn, dueled to mid stretch, continued willingly to about the sixteenth pole then faded. BELLE TAPISSERIE , away alertly, drafted
back off the pace, angled out and circled five to six wide into the stretch, raced on his left lead and slowly gained. JAMMER lacked speed inside, was under
pressure into the lane and got past tired ones. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) , five wide early, dropped in near the turn, edged up to be in range mid turn,
came back out for the drive and faded. UNMATCHABLE , four wide stalking the early pace, was under coaxing mid stretch, failed to kick on and weakened
in the drive.
