Footnotes
LITTLEBITAMEDAL unhurried while between rivals then along the rail, roused early on the bend, shifted out four wide, rallied outside and reeled in leader
nearing the wire. I BELONG TO BECKY briefly dueled then grabbed command from the inside, padded cushion around the turn and into the stretch, but
could not stave off the winner in deep stretch. SHORT OF EZ tracked pacesetter from off the rail, moved up some three wide on the turn, continued
prominently into the lane, could not threaten top pair in final furlong but clearly bested others. PROOF IT bobbled slightly then brushed outside foe leaving
the gate, advanced some from along the fence into and on the bend, then had little left for the drive. COSA NOSTRA (IRE) reserved while three deep early,
chased off the rail or outside the winner into and early on the turn, dropped back and weakened. J T'S A. T. M. showed good early foot and prompted the
early issue while outside pacesetter, continued two wide then between rivals and also weakened.

Footnotes
CHAOS THEORY tracked pace from along the fence, continued inside then found clear path MIKES TIZNOW in the drive, surged under strong urging and
nailed TEXAS WEDGE in the final feet. TEXAS WEDGE moved up bit along the fence, was in bit tight nearing the bend, drifted out slightly exiting the bend,
bid outside leader late in the drive, gained brief lead but was overtaken by winner in final strides. MIKES TIZNOW sped to the front, carved out the pace
while slightly off the rail, continued two wide into and through the drive, was collared a sixteenth out and gave ground grudgingly from between the top pair.
OVERDUE was off a step slow, trailed from the inside, angled out four wide leaving the turn, continued outside and finished very willingly. MR VARGAS
stalked while outside rival, remained three wide around the turn, came out further entering the stretch and lacked needed response. TILTED TOWERS
rushed up early from the outside, stalked three wide into and around the bend then gradually shifted to the inside in the lane and weakened.

ZESTFUL quickly stepped to the front, deftly rated setting an uncontested pace, roused passing quarter marker and comfortably held while under steady
handling and shown stick in late stages. POTANTICO was bumped by inside rival in initial strides, between early then was taken back and angled well off
the rail, advanced four wide around final turn and into the stretch and clearly proved second best. THE STIFF stumbled then bumped with outside rival
leaving the gate, tracked pace from off the rail, continued three wide to final turn, was inside runner-up entering the lane and got up for the show while three
abreast at the wire. KING OF SPEED was closest pursuer to pacesetter while on two wide path, remained bit off the fence, between rivals into the stretch
and lost narrow decision for third. UNBROKEN STAR content to stalk from the inside, hugged the rail into and thorough the stretch and was outfinished by
outside rivals.

COVER VERSION unhurried while saving ground into backstretch, launched rally into second bend, advanced three then four wide into the stretch, inhaled
inside rivals in the drive, surged to the front and edged away nearing the wire. STARSHIP SKY tracked pacesetter from along the rail into and around the
final bend, came out slightly through the drive and outfinished I GIVE UP for the place. I GIVE UP between rivals early, continued either two wide or along
the rail to the second turn, moved up bid along the fence in the drive, loomed past mid-stretch then lost narrow decision for the place. BRISTOL BAYOU
quickly assumed control, set uncontested pace into the stretch, relinquished command past eighth marker then gave way in final sixteenth. UNBREAKABLE
caught three deep into first turn, stalked off the rail or three wide, came in slightly on second turn, between foes in upper stretch and weakened bit late.
LET'S GO NOW kept the pacesetter company while outside that foe to the second bend, left that turn three wide and also weakened some in the drive.

Footnotes
LITTLE NO WAY gained stalking position from off the rail, tracked pace three wide, moved up some under asking while four wide into the stretch and finally
wore down rivals in final yards from the far outside. VODKA TWIST attended the pace into and through the backstretch, moved alongside pacesetter a
quarter out, poked his now in front entering the stretch, battled between rivals through the drive and was denied from inside the winner. R CHA CHA was
sent to the front, set pressured pace from the inside, resisted when challenged late on the second bend, fought back inside through grueling drive and only
gave ground grudgingly late. WRITE ME A SONG prominently placed from the inside, saved ground into the stretch, loomed in mid-stretch but weakened
slightly in the final sixteenth. IN THE DEEP reserved along the rail, chased from the inside to second turn, came out slightly into the lane but failed to
menace late. DEVIL'S TEETH was bit squeezed in initial strides, settled two wide, chased three wide around the last turn and four wide into the stretch while
never threatening. CEDAR RAPIDS settled off the rail, came in some and chased the leaders, angled back out on the second bend, came four wide into the
stretch and lacked needed response. BIG SKY LOGAN reserved from off the rail, chased three wide to the last turn, dropped back around that bend and
weakened in the stretch.

FLY TO MARS bobbled leaving the gate, quickly recovered and prompted pace while outside leader, continued prominently into the lane, roused in the
drive, battled outside leader and finally got up past stubborn rival in final yards. CLAYTON DELANEY was sent to the front, dictated pace from the inside
into the lane, dug in from the inside, battled gamely but could not stave off winner nearing the wire. RUSTIC CANYON angled out in opening strides,
bumped sharply with outside rival, settled inside, saved ground to second turn, came out in upper stretch and finished willingly from between rivals.
TROPICAL TERROR was bumped and jostled from between rivals shortly after the start, settled well off the pace, saved ground into second bend, shiofted
out three then four wide into the stretch and finished strongly from the outside. SEA OF LIBERTY bumped between in initial strides, chased from off the rail,
continued three then four wide into the lane and outfinished for better placing. HANDSOME CAT bumped with inside rival after the start, stalked inside,
remained along the rail into the stretch and weakened in the drive. MYSTERIOUS STONES stalked three wide, remained on same path to the stretch and
also weakened. FIRST PREZ also was bumped shortly after the break, chased from between rivals, dropped back around the last turn and tired.
FOLLOWING A STEWAQRDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START, RUSTIC CANYON WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOURTH FOR COMING OUT
AND IMPEDING TROPICAL TERROR.

Footnotes
CROSSWORD sped to the front, set pace from along the rail, resisted when challenged late on the turn, re-stablished short advantage from the inside in
mid-stretch, inched away under right handed urging and safely held. THAT COREY close up early while three wide, moved up and challenged three abreast
leaving the bend, battled outside in upper stretch but was turned back by the winner. GORDY'S BOY had good early foot, forced the pace outside leader,
bid between rivals passing quarter pole and well into the stretch but weakened later in the drive. THELUTEISMINE reserved off the early pace, chased two
wide or between foes, came three wide into the stretch and went willingly to the wire. BUKAYO stalked from off the rail then three wide on the turn and failed
to make any late impact. PEDRO PEREZ chased from the inside, remained along the rail and lacked needed response. HARD METAL chased early from
the outside then three wide, angled over on the turn, shifted back out in the stretch and failed to menace. GABBY HAYES dwelt at the start, dropped far
back in the early stages and never recovered while saving ground. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A REVIEW INVOLVING THE START BUT RULED
THAT THE STARTING GATE OPENED PROPERLY GABBY HAYES CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEM.
