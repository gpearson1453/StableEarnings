BAYOU BELLE raced in mid pack, closed three-wide on the far turn, rallied gamely and was up late, driving. I WONDER, in range, closed three and
four-wide on the far turn, launched a determined drive but was outkicked late. UNDER THE EYE showed brief speed then stalked the pace, bid upper
stretch, shook clear but failed to stay as she approached the wire. CHOOSE HOPE raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the far turn then rallied
gamely outside. A BRIDGE TOO FAR settled in mid pack, raced two and three-wide on the final turn, chased into the stretch and gained steadily to the end.
ELEANOR POWELL, pinched back at the start, raced in mid pack, chased two-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and rallied, but lost positions
late. SHEDAT showed early speed, led midway through the first turn, set a reserved pace, was headed upper stretch and gave chase. VINYASA stumbled
leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, chased three then two-wide from far back on the turn and was unable to threaten. CHERUBIC stalked the pace, was
hustled two and three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the final 16th. CAPABLE, rated off the pace, was hustled four-wide on
the far turn and roused at the top of the stretch but never reached contention. D'S SOUL was taken back from speedy rivals and settled in mid pack, was
hustled from the rail on the far turn but failed to menace. VANA GRAND settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the far turn but lacked a strong late
response. REAL CHOPPER, in mid pack early, was hustled on the far turn but tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
DYNA'S GAMBLE won a multi-horse scramble for the lead, cleared off around the turn and maintained a safe margin to the wire, despite not changing leads
the entire stretch. LYRICAL NOTE was squeezed back at the start, came from well back along the rail before tipping out to the five or six path in upper
stretch, lugged in behind a rival and steadied nearing the eighth pole, regrouped and came running in the final sixteenth to grab the place spot. BIG TIME
LOUIE settled in mid pack and outside rivals, came three wide on the turn and drifted in and out in the stretch, eventually inside the place finisher with good
late energy. ONE MORE DRIFT chased inside the leader, had the place position turning into the stretch but was out run in the final eighth. HARDY CANDY
advanced three to four wide into range late on the turn, moved into second in midstretch but hung in the final stages, settling for a minor award. MAJESTIC
MELODY settled off the pace and was two to three wide on the turn, giving the rider trouble shifting in in upper stretch while lugging in and stalling in the
final sixteenth. DOUBLE THE HEART chased wide early, stayed in the three path around the turn but could not move up in the lane, retreating to the wire.
HESATHRILLER chased along the inside, out in the two path through the turn and lost ground down the stretch. SAN NICOLA BREW in mid pack and in the
two path around the bend, had no bid down the stretch. LEGAL GUMP sat in mid pack and circled three to four wide on the turn before fading down the
stetch. ABSOLUTION began sluggishly from the inside post, stayed near the rear throughout and could not reach contention. ITSTARTSWITHADRINK sat
in mid pack along the inside and dropped back from midway on the turn to the wire. KILKENNY PROSPECT went for the early lead with a few rivals, sat
inside and behind but had no response from the turn to the wire. LUCKY STREET off the pace and trailing into the turn, never reaching contention.

BETWIXTING stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn, bid in the final furlong and drew clear then finished under a hand ride.
DOUBLE MEDAL settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail through the turn then rallied gamely between foes. EVER SO D'WILD raced in mid pack,
was hustled two-wide on the turn then rallied determinedly. BIG MISTAKE settled off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn, chased into the
stretch and rallied outside. LADY KRATOS broke outward, stalked the pace, bid a furlong out, led for a stride and was passed and gave way. ISHIYAYA, in
range, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn and was all out through the stretch. SYSTEMIC RISK led quickly, set the pace, was headed a furlong out
and gave way. GELATO AMORE raced in mid pack, saved ground on the turn then was blocked through the stretch. TAKE IT EASY settled in mid pack,
chased three and four-wide on the turn then evened out in the final furlong. CAIRA, away slowly and off the pace, trailed throughout and was declared a non
starter due to an unfair start. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START CONCERNING CAIRA DEEMED THAT THE FILLY HAD RECEIVED AN
UNFAIR START AND CAIRA WAS A NON-STARTER.

FIELD PASS was away alertly, stalked the pace, chased hard on the far turn, challenged in the final furlong and drove clear. BELICHICK raced in mid pack,
closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, bid in the final furlong but was outfinished. MALIBU MAMBO stalked early then forced the pace on
the far turn, bid at the top of the stretch, was no match and gave way albeit grudgingly. MIGHTY HEART had the early lead, set a reserved pace, quickened
late turn but was joined at the top of the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. MNEMBA ISLAND settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the
turn then rallied belatedly. DEVIANT, away slowly then rated off the pace, chased three to five-wide on the turn but never reached contention. DUNE OF
PILAT (FR), pinched back at the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then evened out in the stretch. LUCKY CURLIN raced
in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
ARTIE'S PRINCESS broke in and bumped a rival at the start, advanced with two rivals with designs on the lead but was content to let another go, stalked
and bid for the front late on the turn and put that foe away in upper stretch, a diminishing margin late, the wire coming just in time. BOARDROOM off the
pace early and hard held, was run into the back of rivals when a foe closed up to her outside early on the turn, waited for traffic to clear and circled around
four wide late on the turn, switched leads in upper stretch and came at the winner fast but ran out of real estate. OUR SECRET AGENT leapt up awkwardly
at the start, settled between rivals chasing in behind the leaders on the turn, was in range turning for home but was outkicked by the top pair, clearly third
best today. AMALFI COAST settled in mid pack chasing the three pace setters into the turn, was in tight quarters on the turn and shuffled back to trail, mildly
re-rallying near the inside late but stalling in the final seventy yards. PAINTING was crowded by a rival at the start, rallied three wide on the turn into a good
position turning for home but was out of run by midstretch, falling back and losing ground. JAKARTA had the lead, was stalked and pressed by the winner,
headed by that one late on the turn and retreated down the stretch. SOUPER ESCAPE rushed up the rail to inside stalk the leader, dropped back to chase
on the turn and retreated down the lane.
