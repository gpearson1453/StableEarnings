Footnotes
KITTEN'S FIRSTLOVE stalked along the inside and from the pocket, tipped three wide at the five sixteenths pole to be outside of the dueling leaders, bid at
the three sixteenths pole, drew off readily under driving pressure through midstretch, and was ridden out through the final sixteenth. FULSOME raced far off
of the pace in the two, then three, paths around the turns, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, and rallied outside of foes through the final furlong to
reach place. BOURBON HIGHWAY lied forwardly placed two wide, then in the three to four path around the far turn before drifting to the six path turning for
home, and produced a mild rally, but was outfinished by an outer foe for place. HALFBARBERBINGIE was off step slowly, raced far off of the pace in the
two path around both turns, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, chased from behind foes while gaining mildly, then surged between rivals approaching
the wire for a minor reward. COMMITTED got a bit keen behind foes into the first turn, saved ground from midpack around that bend, then tracked from two
wide and between horses around the far turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and chased between horses through the lane. HAPPY CHAMP pulled
to set the pace along the inside, felt stern pressure from HIGH PRESS around the far turn, turned that foe back passing the quarter pole, but was quickly
headed by the eventual winner at the three sixteenths pole, and subsequently gave way. TAPWOOD got keen early when restrained from tight quarters,
tucked into the first turn while rating off of the pace, improved around the far turn while saving ground to chase the leaders from the inside in upper stretch,
tipped three wide around the furlong grounds, but lacked a kick to split foes and produce a bid. BENIAH saved ground far off of the pace, shifted to the four
path in upper stretch, but was bumped while trying to split foes at the furlong pole, and weakened. HIGH PRESS prompted the pace two wide while keen
around the first turn, vied around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch. ROOKIE YEAR raced off of the pace three wide around the first turn, but faded
while getting floated to the five path around the far turn.

advantage inside the final sixteenth under a long drive. MINE MY TIME stalked outside of foes early on, vied four to three wide around the turn, assumed
command turning for home, dug in in midstretch as SNAGGLETOOTH ranged up alongside, then was edged out by that foe in the final sixteenth, and just
held place. VIVID VERSE tracked from midpack three wide and between horses, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and sustained a grinding rally outside of
the leaders through the lane, but just missed place on the wire. PADDY O'DINI rushed along the inside to vie two wide and between horses into the turn,

Footnotes
HANSENS MISCHIEF chased the leading duelers from the three path into the turn, bid for the lead between horses at the five sixteenths pole, held an
advantage in upper stretch, then kicked clear from chasing foes passing the furlong pole. INTIMIDATION brushed an outer foe at the start and was off
slowly, trailed the field around the turn, came into the lane in the three path, shifted six wide in midstretch, then split foes and sustained a rally to reach
place. WYOMING CONQUEST lied forwardly placed in the four path, made a sweeping four wide bid at the five sixteenths pole while outside of HANSENS
MISCHIEF, chased that foe in upper stretch as others rallied along side, but failed to keep pace with him passing the furlong pole, and weakened late.
BIGMANCAN bumped an outer foe at the start, raced far off of the pace two wide around the turn, shifted to the seven path in midstretch, and stayed on
mildly outside of tiring foes through the late stagse. CRITIC tracked from midpack in the three to four path around the turn, swung six wide turning for home,
but failed to keep pace with the leader at the furlong pole, shifted in while hanging on his left lead, and kept on between horses. SOARING BIRD hopped at
the start, tracked from midpack two wide and between horses around the turn, shifted five wide turning for home, but was outkicked between horses in
upper stretch, then was outfinished for minor rewards. CONTINENTAL CLASH dueled for the lead two wide, but tired on his left lead in upper stretch. CAN
IMAGINE dueled for the lead inside of a rival, but was headed by other foes at the five sixteenths pole, then further weakened through the final furlong.
PHAST PHAROAH was bumped at the start, raced off of the pace in the four path around the turn, but faded. SUBLIMINALCRIMINAL saved ground off of
the pace, but was done early.

Footnotes
EVIL LYN tucked around the first turn to stalk the leaders along the inside, awaited racing room turning for home, then split foes at the furlong pole through
a large opening created by TYNAN drifting, produced a bid, drifted a bit inwards while clearing her inner rival, and prevailed over a pair of outer foes on the
wire. ASK BAILEY saved ground while trailing, shifted six wide through midstretch, and surged outside of foes in the late stages, but just missed while
getting up foe place. TEENAGE KICKS raced far off of the pace in the two path, then from the three to four path around the far turn before swinging five
wide turning for home, rallied outside of foes through upper stretch to produce a bid at the furlong pole, forged a narrow advantage, but was outfinished by
an inner and an outer rival in the late stages. TIMELESS ROSE set the pace along the inside, held an advantage from a pair foes around the far turn, dug in
in upper stretch, but was headed passing the furlong marker, and yielded on his left lead at the sixteenth pole. TYNAN stalked then vied two wide and
between horses, held vying position turning for home, but drifted out while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, then weakened between foes through
the final sixteenth. MARIAFOOT (FR) pressed the pace four to three wide, but failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch. KOURVOISIER (IRE)
got rank from restraint early on, tracked from midpack two wide, chased three wide around the far turn, then came into the lane four wide and between
horses, but was outkicked in upper stretch. MY HEART SINGS raced off of the pace along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, and failed to factor.

HONORABLE MEMORY prompted the pace three wide, bid turning for home, dueled outside of the bidding MY MANE GIRL through the lane, prevailed
over that foe inside the sixteenth pole, then held SILVERBELLA at bay to the wire. SILVERBELLA saved ground off of the pace, shifted four wide at the
quarter pole, split foes through midstretch and rallied to produce a late bid, but missed. MOTOWN GIRL tracked from midpack two wide and between
horses, shifted five wide while still between foes at the quarter pole, and produced a grinding rally through the final furlong, but did not have enough to catch
the leaders. MY MANE GIRL was off slowly, recovered and rushed to an inside stalking position, awaited racing room turning for home before smoothly
tipping two wide at the quarter pole, dueled for the lead inside of HONORABLE MEMORY through the lane, but brushed that foe while yielded passing the
sixteenth pole. WHISPERING PINES dueled for the lead along the inside of rivals, but gave way in upper stretch. SCONSET raced far off of the pace, came
into the lane in the three path, and improved past tiring feos. RED HOT BABE stalked four wide, then came into the lane six wide and between horses, but
faltered in upper stretch. SISTER'S GHOST raced off of the pace in the five path, gained in the six path approaching the five sixteenths pole before swinging
eight wide at the quarter pole, but flattened out in upper stretch. BELLUCCI advanced in the five path at the five sixteenths pole while inside of SISTER'S
GHOST, came into the lane seven wide and between horses, but flattened out in upper stretch. ZOOLOGY hopped at the start and was off slowly, then
never got involved. AMERICA'S SURPRISE dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened at the quarter pole. PICTORIAL was
unprepared and dwelt severely at the start, and was outrun thereafter.
