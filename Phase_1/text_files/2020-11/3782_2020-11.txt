Footnotes
QUIPO was bumped by both SUPERDUTY JUSTICE and GREY POINT at the start, recovered and chased the pace to the turn, saved ground to the
stretch, shifted off the rail, rallied when set down and wore down SUPERDUTY JUSTICE late. SUPERDUTY JUSTICE broke out, bumped the winner then
was knocked hard when that one was pushed inward by GREY POINT, recovered and set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded determinedly to
mid stretch then could not stall the winner. KODIACTION pressed the pace three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and lacked the needed late
response. GREY POINT broke inward, bumped the winner into the runnerup then prompted the pace inside of KODIACTION and two wide to the stretch but
also could not make an impact in the drive. TIGER ON THE PROWL had no speed, lagged to the stretch then closed the gap without threatening. EDWARD
T. also had no speed, was off the rail on the turn and came up empty in the stretch.

TWILIGHT RIDER was unhurried while trailing to the second, waited behind rivals to the stretch then shifted out for room, rallied when set down and edged
clear driving. BOBBY'S ALIBI set the pace from the rail to the second turn, met a bid from CITY CHAMP to mid stretch then could not stall the winner but
saved second. WARRIORS HERO was chasing to the half, bid three wide on the second turn, was a factor to mid stretch then was outfinished. CITY
CHAMP prompted the pace three wide, made a bid two wide into the second turn, engaged for the lead into the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then was
also outkicked to the line. A LITTLE BIT LUCKY stalked the pace from the rail to the stretch then came up empty.

Footnotes
TIM'S STREET GIRL was bumped by ABIGAIL ALDEN at the start, stalked hte leaders to the turn, was roused leaving the three eighths, rallied three wide,
engaged for the lead in mid stretch then inched clear driving. M FAST prompted the pace two wide, dueled to mid stretch then could not stay with the winner
but held second. KISS OF CONGRATS was outrun to the turn, shifted out to the three path to the stretch then swung out widest and was closing belatedly.
UNUSUAL SECRET had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch then picked off rivals without threatening. SPLIT MY JEANS hopped at the start and lost
about three lengths, was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. ON THE VERGE was also void of speed,
came two wide to the stretch but finished evenly. CHRIS IS READY hustled to contest the pace from the rail to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch
and tired. ABIGAIL ALDEN broke in, bumped the winner then chased the pace from the rail to the stretch and gave way.

ALWAYS IN VEGAS had the best speed, set the pace to the backstretch, dueled LIVE IT WELL from the rail to the stretch then met a bid from DROP THE
MIC in mid stretch and dug in gamely. DROP THE MIC was allowed to settle to the second turn, bid three then four wide to the stretch, rallied to challenge
the winner in mid stretch but was outfinished late. RED BUNTING (IRE) stalked the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then was outkicked
to mid stretch and finished evenly. SILLY NOTION was four wide to the backstretch, tracked to the half, was three wide to the stretch then got outrun to mid
stretch and did not rally. LIVE IT WELL pressed the pace to the half, dueled the winner two wide to the stretch then tired. LOUS TIZNOW broke out at the
start, was rank early and trailed throughout.
