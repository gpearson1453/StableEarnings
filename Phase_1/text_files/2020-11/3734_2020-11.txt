Footnotes
JACK BO was forwardly place to press the early leader, took command through the far turn and held gamely in the drive to be well clear under strong
handling. TAPPAHANNOCK stalked the early pace, raced three deep through the stretch and was no match for the winner. COOKE BROTHERS settled off
the early pace, moved up around the far turn, steadied briefly nearing the quarter pole, angled out to the four path and flattened out in the drive. A jockey
objection was filed for interference at the quarter pole against Tappahannock and stewards ruled no change. APPRAISED was allowed to settle early, raced
four wide into the upper stretch and had no late response. GREEK PRINCE was bumped at the break, raced five wide at the eighth pole and never was a
factor. ALPHASTEST showed good speed while racing along the inside and gave way. I'LL MAKE U FAMOUS dropped back early, saved ground and never
threatened.

Footnotes
PRINCESS PAO showed good early speed to set all the pace and was well clear late under steady handling. SING ALONG SUZY bobbled at the break,
raced five wide into the upper stretch and was no match for the winner. SEA STORY was off slowly, saved ground and had not enough late. BEAN
INDISCREET stalked the early pace, raced five wide through the stretch and had no late response. NOT MY MONEY was slow early on, raced three wide at
the eighth pole and failed to respond. DANCING TIL DUSK tracked the leader while racing two deep and tired. CORNETTA'S CHOICE was forced to check
sharply in the early stages, raced seven wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. GUILDER was unhurried early and never threatened. GOLD
CADILLAC failed to sustain a bid.

rivals and weakened a bit in the final stages. PALATIAL TIMES was slow early on, raced towards the inside and had no final bid. PENSAMIENTO settled off
the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. ALPHA QUEUE showed good early speed along the inside and gave way in the

DAY THE MUSIC DIED showed good early speed, set all the pace and drew off under a steady hand ride while racing in hand in the final stages. PROUD
ENOUGH stalked the early pace, saved ground around the far turn through the stretch and was no match for the winner. THE FORTY FACTOR tracked the
leader while racing two deep and weakened late. TIME FLIES BY was unhurried early, raced seven wide into the upper stretch and improved his position.
TEAM TIM settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside and had no response. FORT ROYAL was bumped at the break, raced in tight quarters just
past the eighth pole while racing four wide and never was a serious threat. IWISHIWASPECIAL was unhurried early, raced four wide at the eighth pole and
never was a factor. CORREJON broke awkwardly, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. TOWN POLICY failed to sustain a bid.
