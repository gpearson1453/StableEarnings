Footnotes
TAP THE BARREL away well, got steered into the two path prior to departing the backstretch, inched up to the leader during the final jumps of the run
around the bend, was given her cue and challenged in earnest stepping onto the top of the lane, took charge during the ensuing furlong then drew off, kept
busy to the end. CASHMERE QUEEN retained the advantage after out-breaking the competition, was a bit rank early on the backstretch fighting the bit,
settled down and moved onto the inside route by the half mile pole, showed the way, feeling only token resistance, was put to the test by TAP THE BARREL
shortly after spinning into the lane, yielded, then held on well enough long enough to save second. JORDY CAN TAP dove over to the rail after bumping
with GRAM'S GAL in the shadow of the starting gate, took it until the end of the bend, tipped towards path two for the drive, went on to secure the show.
TWIDDLE sighted two wide on the turn, angled approximately four wide into the stretch, was never in it. GRAM'S GAL out with her first step made contact
with JORDY CAN TP, was between the inside route and path two in pursuit of the pace for the opening half, commenced the stretch one path farther off the
rail, gave way.

Footnotes
ATHENA DANCER tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing three furlongs out, cut the corner into upper stretch, angled out to
the five path at the three-sixteenths and rallied outside a quartet to issue a challenge through the final sixteenth getting up in the last strides to the finish to
prevail. NO PAYNE three then two wide in pursuit in range of the front, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied
to take command a furlong out, dug in tussling with CAUMSETT to his inside, rebuffed that rival, then got caught in the last jumps to the finish while safe for
the place honors. GET THE CANDY coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
three wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish and was just up for the show honors on the wire. CAUMSETT three to four wide in aim of the front,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths issuing a challenge for the command, spun three wide into upper stretch, took over the front straightened away,
dug in under a drive and was collared a furlong out, kept on through to the finish and was nailed on the wire for the show honors. SOCIAL WHIRL
established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from BARREL OF BLISS to the outside, tucked inside briefly at the
seven-sixteenths, floated back to the two path midway on the turn when shaking off her main pace rival, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths
confronted by the aforementioned foe, took the inside route into upper stretch yielding the front straightened away and weakened in the late stages.
TRADEWAR chased just off the inside from mid pack coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and offered no response.
LOVE'S MISERY three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. BONANA FANNA FOE
lunged at the start getting away last and conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside down the backstretch
and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from midway, cut the corner into upper stretch and made no impact. DUTCHESS OF N Y chased
two to three wide striding a bit greenly down the backstretch and into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued two to three wide for
home and weakened. BARREL OF BLISS pressed the pace from the outside three then two wide until nearing the three-eighths, retreated through the latter
portion of the turn, went five to six wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
NOBLE THOUGHT saved ground for most of the initial three-quarters, got swung out into the two path for the drive home, closed in on the one to catch
relentlessly, stealing away the decision in the final jump. ABIDING STAR established the top before leaving the homestretch, was able to be rated showing
the way on a loosely-contested lead, subtly shifting about between the inside route and the two path, turned into the lane, was heading for the furlong
grounds when finally let loose, dug in with good determination as the winner chipped away at the deficit, got nailed in the last stride. MOROCCO underwent
a two wide pursuit until the end of the second bend, angled five wide into the stretch, had a good finish down the center of the course to garner the show.
WILLING TO SPEED tracked the front runners from along the rail, cut the corner into the stretch, made no headway in the final furlong. ATTENTIVE sat
reserved two wide in midpack during the initial stages, travelled towards the three path on the far turn, commenced the stretch one path wider, flattened out.
DREAM DOCTOR failed to fire after undergoing a ground-saving journey. SOULMATE kept watch from along the inside, went three wide into the stretch,
had no closing punch. PATRIOT DRIVE made it over to the rail prior to departing the chute, stayed put for nearly six furlongs, was let out a notch moving to
the outside from the five-sixteenths pole, wound up in the neighborhood of path six a furlong later, made no impact. RAPT cut over to the inside route,
abandoned it by tipping into the two path at the three-eighths pole, wandered out into path eight once in the stretch having never made his presence felt.
ZERO GRAVITY took up the chase from the two path after brushing the gate, was maneuvered out seven wide from upper to midstretch, lacked a response.
OLD DOMINION forwardly placed along the inside on the homestretch, stalked ABIDING STAR from path two after that one had assumed control, kept at it
for three-quarters and gave way.

Footnotes
MO MAVERICK directly abreast of CALL ME HARRY for the initial panel, was eased back, tipped into the two path coming up to the top of the turn, and
after being let out a notch, hitched up to the aforementioned opponent, kept the pressure on from the half mile pole to the quarter pole, inched up towards
that one as the half was being completed, settled in at the top of the lane and was given his cue, forged to the front end by the beginning of the final furlong
after battling from between rivals to get there, saw a three-way tussle morph into a one on one sort a sixteenth later, dug in gamely to fend off the second
place finisher. BUSTIN SHOUT along the outside throughout, departed the backstretch from the three path, increased its presence as the second fraction
was being finalized, got cued up, vied with vigour as the outermost of three from the top of the lane until the general of the sixteenth marker, left that station
dueling with the winner, was determined to the end but had to settle for the place. CALL ME HARRY assumed control early on the backstretch after MO
MAVERICK backed off a bit, cut over to the rail once sufficiently in the clear soon afterwards, showed the way, pressed by the top one, had the runner up
arrive on the scene at the end of the bend, got turned loose, gave in to the outside assault deep into the furlong grounds, fought on with willingness
afterwards to earn the show award. VALMONT took up position in midpack, worked out a tuck along the inside at the seven-sixteenths pole, patiently kept
watch on the front runners, angled four wide spinning into the stretch, narrowed in. OPT darted over to the rail, was still on it entering the stretch, gradually
altered into path five during the final furlong, gained some. QIAN B C gently pinched shortly after the field had been sent on its way, travelled two wide on
the turn, got moved out into the five path for the drive, made no impact. COLONEL TOM failed to fire after undergoing a ground-saving journey.
STEELERSFANFORLIFE pursued the pace from the two path, got sent out five wide entering the stretch, never made his presence felt. FREEWHEELER
chased the pace two to three wide, fanned out six once in the stretch while backing away.

COUNTERPARTY RISK (IRE) two to three wide through the first turn, settled three then four wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied outside to overhaul a trio battling for command just inside the sixteenth marker and prevailed
edging away at the end. PALAMOS (GB) tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper
stretch, rallied digging in to confront the top pair through the final furlong running on to the finish, got overhauled in concert with a pair of rivals inside the
sixteenth pole and finished willingly for the place honors. STAR COMMAND broke in at the start bumping THIS JUST IN, settled just off the pace two then
three wide, remained patiently handled until set down spinning three then two wide straightened away into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily
whittling away at the leader between foes when overtaken by the top one inside the sixteenth marker and kept on to preserve the show honors. ALEMIA
established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits settled into a comfortably rhythm, cut the corner roused into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive safe to the eighth pole, came under threat inside that station from a pair, relented the front a sixteenth out battling heads apart
for command with that pair when overthrown as a trio by the eventual winner, then weakened in the late stages. LOOK ME OVER tracked the pace along
the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, angled four wide into uppers tretch and made no headway. LEAH
CHASE two then three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch
and passed tired rivals. NICENO saved ground at the tail of the field, came under urging at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and improved
position by tired rivals. ADMAA chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. STRINGS
ATTACHED tracked the pace just off the inside from mid pack, got steadied off the heels six furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. I'M FINE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper
stretch and tired. THIS JUST IN bumped at the start by STAR COMMAND, who broke inwards, raced forwardly placed attending the leader to the outside in
the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside for home and tired.

Footnotes
LETMETAKETHISCALL away in good order, attained a forward position, was well held in the two path prompting the pacesetter, inched up towards that one
just as the second split was to be posted, had already grabbed away the advantage when asked for more deep into the furlong grounds, responded and
scampered away. MISS JIMMY pursued the pace primarily from the two path, proved no match for the runaway winner yet launched a good rally
nevertheless to procure the place. FIERCE LADY loosely pocket, was switched to some light hand urging on the turn after being firmly rated prior, angled
three wide into the lane, got outfinished. PUFFERY three wide onto the turn, got sent out five wide exiting it, mustered up a mild response sufficient enough
to grab the last major check. PLAYTONE settled towards the back of the pack, travelled from path two on the turn, got steered towards path four for the
drive, closed in, but all done without having made any impact. QUALITY STONES a forward factor three wide for the opening half, gave way. FORGOTTEN
HERO off a length the fastest, cut over to the rail with the advantage, was forced to fend off the winner, got collared shortly after stepping into the lane,
backed away steadily in the last eighth. JEWEL OF ARABIA took up residence in midpack, raced two to three wide on the turn, was induced into fanning out
six wide from upper to midstretch, faltered. FAIR REGIS sent over to the rail approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, cut the corner into the lane,
came up empty. SPEIGHTSTOWN GAL four wide departing the backstretch, displayed only brief speed.

SO HIGH (GB) tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, bumped with MALTHAEL
straightened away, dug in under a drive between foes through the final furlong taking narrow command a sixteenth from home and prevailed gamely on the
wire. MALTHAEL saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, got bumped by the
aforementioned foe straightened away, dug in under a drive heads apart for command inside the final furlong placing SO HIGH in a bit tight between rivals,
fought on game to the finish but was ultimately denied on the wire. DREAM FRIEND coaxed from the gate, outsprinted TURN OF EVENTS for the front and
forced that rival to concede midway on the first turn, showed the way in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into
upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and clung to command to the sixteenth marker when displaced, fought on inside that pair to the finish clear for
the show honors. VOTING CONTROL saved ground in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide
into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to close in in the late stages. KID MERCURY saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to close belatedly to the finish. TURN OF EVENTS hustled from the gate,
knocked heads early on with DREAM FRIEND into the first turn before being eased off to concede the front midway on that turn taking to the two path,
tracked the leader in closest aim, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive prominent to the eighth
pole before weakening in the late stages. IMPAZIBLE ODDS three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SCORESWHENHEWANTS broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, then
brushed with ARITHMETIC, chased just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside for home and tired. LETTERMAN three
wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide for home and tired. ARITHMETIC got
brushed at the start by SCORESWHENHEWANTS who broke inwards, chased three to four wide, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and was eased
through to the finish.

Footnotes
SUN SUMMERS secured the pocket after the field had been released, kept watch within striking distance, turned into the lane, obtained clear room along
the rail corridor soon afterwards, forged to the front, felt some heavy pressure in the final stages, but dug in with good determination to prevail. GOGO
SHOES saved ground for the opening three-quarters, angled four wide for the drive home, finished with willingness down the center of the course to garner
the place. WINDFALL PROFIT tracked the front runners while taking the inside route, slowly made her way into the two path as three-quarters was being
reeled off, idled along in traffic, out-shouldered a weakening SHORT POUR just past the eighth pole to secure running room, mustered up a mild response
for the show. APURATE circled its way into the role of primary pursuer with a three wide run on the clubhouse bend, tucked closer to the rail stepping onto
the backstretch and went on to press the issue from there all the way to the quarter pole, moved a bit wider to challenge about three wide stepping onto the
top of the lane, flattened out. FIERCE SCARLETT chased the pace two wide for nearly six furlongs, tipped into path three coming up to the five-sixteenths
pole, finished off the run around the far turn, got steered out towards path six from upper to midstretch, narrowed in. UNA LUNA mostly two wide early,
travelled in path three on the second bend, was one path wider getting ridden into the lane, lacked the necessary response. R V TREASURE brought up the
back of the pack, tucked along the rail at the half mile pole, continued along it, angled three wide coming into the lane, had no rally. EYE OF A SOLDIER
quickly placed in path two, ventured on it for three-quarters, arrived in the stretch, got sent out seven wide but all to no avail. FIONNBHARR two wide on
both turns, was slightly wider on the backstretch, went into path six for the drive home, came up empty. SHORT POUR broke on top and retained the
advantage, showed the way from the rail, shadowed by APURATE from the outside, got overhauled in the furlong grounds, steadily backed away.
