stretch. FACT CHECKING, bumped at the start, gained a short lead, set a pressured pace, dueled from upper stretch but was passed late and gave way.
RUNWAY DREAMER, bumped leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, was hustled angling from two to five-wide through the far turn, chased, but evened out
late.

Footnotes
RED FROG took the lead quickly, let a rival come up to his inside on the backstretch, pulled ahead into the turn, let the same rival come up inside midway
on the bend, drifted out turning for home and finally shook clear of that stubborn foe at the sixteenth pole while in the four path, holding safe but needing the
wire late. CHASING VINNY was along the rail and off the pace early, advanced inside around the turn, angled out to the four path in upper stretch and was
closing well late but the winner had too big an edge. GOLDMINE CAT took two shots up the inside of the winner, one in the backstretch and one on the turn,
staying on gamely to the sixteenth pole but losing the place spot in the shadow of the wire. COHIBA GHOST off the pace early and rallied two to three wide
on the turn, spending the entire time on the flank of the eventual place finisher, not gaining ground on that one but closing just as well. ACT OF BOB was
three wide chasing the two leaders throughout, failing to change leads down the lane and losing positions late. BARILKO sat behind the leaders along the
inside, looked dangerous in upper stretch but levelled off in the final stages. HEALY'S HOPE off the pace from his outside post, three to two wide on the turn
and inched up down the lane without entering contention. DARK ALE circled the field two to four wide on the turn and was fanned into the eight path in
upper stretch, lugging in outside a rival down the lane while inching up with that one. WHITE WEDDING was sluggish into stride and trailed the group, put in
a long slow rail run to be in range in upper stretch but stalled and faded in the final sixteenth. BET ALPHA off the pace, tapped on the brakes going into the
far turn and was asked for run on the bend but did not respond. TRAPPEZE ARTIST broke out and bumped a rival at the start, advanced to four wide chase
the leaders and stayed in range until the quarter pole when beginning to tire, backing up down the lane. JERSEY DIAMOND stumbled and was bumped at
the start, accelerated to chase the leaders five wide, then retreated while four wide from mid turn to the wire.

Footnotes
MS WICKED was far back and four to two wide through the first turn, rallied inside on the far turn and shifted out dramatically approaching the quarter pole,
in the six path turning for home, ducked in upper stretch behind rivals, came back out and drove by to lead at the seventy yard pole, in hand the final strides
when clear. SKY OF DREAMS was the first one to get after the leaders when the fast pace caught up to them around the far turn, had the lead turning for
home and held it stubbornly after changing leads by the eighth pole, unable to hold the winner but game to hold second. WAR EMPRESS sat three to two
wide off the pace around the first turn, circled three to four wide into contention by the quarter pole, bid outside while lugging in near the eighth pole,
outkicked late. FANCYSOUL had an awkward beginning, managed to get up the rail throughout and in behind the leaders in upper stretch, getting a seam
by the seventy yard pole and inching up in the final yards. OUT OF ROMANCE along the rail in mid pack, rallied inside on the far turn and angled out turning
for home, loomed dangerously before getting in tight at the sixteenth pole, levelling off late. MITZI was six wide trying for the front into the first turn, got the
lead going into the backstretch but dueled with a rival, shook that one off into the far turn but was headed turning for home and faded in the stretch.
BODENSEE off the pace, was rallying outside the winner in the two path through the far turn, steadied when herded out by that rival nearing the quarter
pole and seemed to lose interest, the rider not persevering down the stretch. EL VALOR was four to three wide off the pace around the first turn, advanced
into range three to five wide nearing the quarter pole when herded out, the rider up in the saddle down the stretch. KNEW AS A BREEZE in mid pack and
five to three wide around the first turn, trailed into the far turn and mildly closed to best the rest without threatening. CONZIP chased the top pair in the two
path around the first turn, was in the three path outside the eventual place finisher around the far turn and retreated down the stretch. OVERSTATE came
off the rail to press the leader entering the backstretch, dueled that one before tiring and retreated through the far turn. VICTORIAVILLE chased in mid pack
while five to four wide around the first turn, dropping back from the three eighths pole to the wire when tiring.

on the far turn then evened out in the final 16th. DR. GREEN steadied at the start and settled off the pace, closed four and five-wide on the far turn then

pinched back at the start, settled off the pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide then rallied along the inside. SHOW SOME SKIN raced in mid pack,
closed four and five-wide on the turn, chased in the stretch but never reached contention. LATER GATOR got away slowly and settled in mid pack, was
hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn, rallied gamely then evened out late. I AM I SAID broke outward and bumped TOUCH OF ROUGE, settled in

Footnotes
PREACHER POWER trailed by many under restraint looking like he didn't have a prayer, then administered an eye catching last to first move on the far turn
in a heartbeat, having a clear lead turning for home, leaving them in his dust while kept to the task. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) was three wide around the first
turn in mid pack, advanced gradually while three to four wide on the far turn and closed down the middle of the track in the stretch, his best stride late, up for
the place. ENGLISH CLASSIC was two wide chasing all the way until bidding early on the far turn, had a brief lead until Arazi went zooming by, a clear
second in mid stretch but passed for place late. SHANGASSAH chased in mid pack along the rail, came off the rail in the far turn and went back to the fence
in midstretch but was outkicked late, holding a minor award. KITTEN'S BOY settled four wide in mid pack around the first turn, rallied three wide into range
through the far turn and stayed in the battle for a placing until tiring in the final sixteenth. DOCTOR UPTOWN trailed after an awkward start, came up the rail
in the first turn to get into the pack near thee rear, angled out to the three path late on the far turn and was fanned out into the six path turning for home,
closing mildly late. WE TAKE CHECKS chased the leaders along the inside, got a dream run up the rail turning for home but had no response when asked
to go on. AM PREPARED was near the rear in the two path, steadied into the far turn when between runners and did not recover to make a bid. JAMMIN
STILL sped to the front, was headed by a rival midway on the far turn and retreated from there. AWESOME MINER stalked in the two path, on hold waiting
for room and lost his path in upper stretch, falling back.

Footnotes
SUITEDCONNECTED raced in mid pack, closed angling from two to five-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch, took command a a 16th out and held
under a drive. FRIGHT NIGHT settled in mid pack, closed angling from two to six-wide through the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch and gained steadily.
ZOOLOGICAL raced in mid pack, closed three-wide on the final turn, chased into the stretch, took command a furlong out but yielded with a 16th to run then
chased to the wire. TRULY ELITE was rated off the pace, closed angling from two to four-wide on the far turn then rallied willingly. HARD N'SWEET broke a
step slowly and settled in mid pack, closed three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and evened out late. MAJESTIC MELODY dueled from
the rail forced the issue on the backstretch then gained a narrow advantage on the far turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch but was headed a furlong
out and grudgingly gave up ground. PRISON PADRE settled off the early pace, was hustled along the rail on the far turn, angled out in the stretch and
gained steadily. SEEMEE was pinched back leaving the gate and settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the far turn, chased into the
stretch but evened out in the late stages. CAT'S WHISPER bumped with ITSTARTSWITHADRINK leaving the gate, chased hard angling from three to
five-wide on the final turn but had no closing response in the stretch. ICE CHALLENGE raced in mid pack while riding the rail, was hustled on the far turn
but was steadied in tight at the top of the stretch then tendered a mild rally but evened out late. ITSTARTSWITHADRINK broke outward and was steadied,
raced in mid pack, dropped back a bit late turn, showed a little run at the top of the stretch but evened out. SPRING EDITION raced in mid pack, closed
angling inward from the fourth path to two-wide on the final turn then flattened out in the final 16th. DOUBLE THE HEART dueled outside MAJESTIC
MELOODY from the outset, held a narrow lead on the backstretch, the positions were reversed and he forced the issue on the final turn and was left behind
at the top of the stretch when he tired and faded.
