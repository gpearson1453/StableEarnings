SECRET ACCOUNT stalked the early leader from along the rail, moved to the front entering the far turn, edged clear soon after and held under strong
urging. GRACEYGAB bobbled leaving the gate, settled inside, advanced the rail around the final turn, edged out nearing the stretch and gained slowly.
QUEEN STINKER was slow early, made a run in the three path around the final turn and gained slowly through the lane. INTOXICOLOGIST had position in
the three path for over six furlongs then weakened. SHINE LIKE BOBBY was no factor. WICKED T was outrun while wide around the final turn.
POSITIVELY MINE made the pace two wide to the far turn then stopped.
