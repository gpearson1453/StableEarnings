Footnotes
BOZZINI coaxed from the gate, dueled in hand from the two path with KING OF RANCH to his inside, shook off that rival three furlongs from home, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear to the eighth pole, the rider getting his whip caught in his arms
briefly before being able to extract it to the near side, dug in under lone threat and held on to prevail. MAGNETRON stumbled at the start, chased three to
four wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to threaten inside
the final sixteenth but ultimately missed at the end. MANDATORY PAYOUT bobbled at the break, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. ECONOMIC POLICY chased three paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tipped out five wide near the three-eighths put to a drive, continued five wide into upper stretch, made no headway through to the finish. KING
OF RANCH coaxed from the start, dueled in hand along the inside of BOZZINI, got shaken off three furlongs out and came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. TRUE BLUE GIANT broke a beat slow, chased four to five paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and made no impact. LOCAL
COUNSEL chased inside briefly before tipping out three wide, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide
for home and tired.

Footnotes
DIVIDED SKY (IRE) taken hold of after being gently pinched in the shadow of the starting gate, straddled the left rim of the inside route by moving into a
snugger fit on it at the top of the turn, was on hold, content to track the front runners from near the rear of the field, got cued up for the drive home, fanned
out, as did most of the others, into path six from upper to midstretch for optimal racing clearance, left the eighth pole full of energy, effortlessly took charge
slightly more than a sixteenth down the road and kicked clear. TEA IN CHINA kept watch on the pace towards the inside during the opening phases, slipped
to the outside and into the two path crossing midpoint on the turn, angled four wide entering the stretch, clawed its way into contention with willingness
during the ensuing furlong, got beaten to the front end by the winner in deep stretch, went on to snag place honors. BUYER'S REMORSE prompted the
pace from path, narrowed in during the final few jumps leading up to the quarter pole, challenged in earnest in the general area of the three-sixteenths
marker, grabbed away the advantage, was herself reeled in with under a sixteenth to go, stayed for the show. KISS AND RUN rode the rail, cut the corner
spinning into the lane, got outfinished. CAREFREE HIGHWAY pursued the pace from path two, got sent out seven wide from upper to midstretch, made no
headway. ROMA CARPE darted over to the inside after the field had been sent off and running, eventually taking up residence in the two path, sat there
until the end of the bend, got steered out towards path eight from upper to midstreth, becoming the widest of all, rallied mildly. RAPIDO GATTA two wide
onto the turn, was in the same one exiting it, had no offering. CELESTIAL DREAM in range two wide, was under rousing taking path three wide for entrance
into the stretch, gave way. IDAKA disputed the pace saving ground for the initial half, shifted into path two stepping onto the head of the stretch, remained in
the fight for the top until midlane before faltering. CANARSIE GIRL saved ground for the opening half, swung out five wide into the stretch, tired.

GONE GLIMMERING moved to the front, showed the way, rated from along the inside route and with OUR CIRCLE OF LOVE in accompaniment two to
three wide, began to edge away from the competition as the half was being completed, struck the three-sixteenths marker and was called upon for more,
built up the advantage to its largest over the course of the next sixteenth, saw the runner up closing in steadily from midstretch onward, held sway. UJJAYI
cut over to the inside after losing her footing springing from the starting gate, kept watch on the top one loosely pocketed, got asked to pick it up in the
vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, stepped into the lane, altered course to be outside the top one with a furlong remaining, gained ground in a steadfast
manner, fell short. OUR CIRCLE OF LOVE gathered after breaking to the outside, prompted the pact two to three wide, was more the latter heading home,
gave way. PERSISTO dove onto the inside route, took it until the end of the bend, got spotted in path two at the head of the stretch, made no headway.
SLIMEY loped along in path two, was worked into path the six path from upper to midstretch, never made her presence felt. JENNEMILY strung out three to
four wide on the turn, tired. FLASHNDYNAMITE three wide in pursuit of the front runners on the turn, got set down at the midway point of the turn, was sent
out into path five from upper to midstretch, faltered.

WESTERN ADVANTAGE broke a half a beat slow, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying willingly through the final furlong to issue a challenge and take command
seventy yards from home, then inched away to the finish to prevail. PERPETUAL CHANGE traded a bump after the start with DUSTGETSINYOUREYES,
saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, lost position and ground to the tail of the field into the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the
corner into upper stretch, tipped out three to four paths just inside the eighth pole and offered up a good finish to close in late and secure the place honors
latching on the leader as he hit the finish. DUSTGETSINYOUREYES traded a bump after the start with the aforementioned foe, tracked the pace along the
inside in closest aim of the leader, advanced in tandem with TANNERS NECK LANE to over throw the front taking command three furlongs from home, cut
the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was caught seventy yards from home. NOBLE JOURNEY four wide into the first turn, tucked three
then two wide settling just off the pace, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home
and ran on to the finish to procure the last major share. TANNERS NECK LANE broke a half a beat slow, chased three wide from mid pack, advanced on
the leader into the far turn in concert with DUSTGETSINYOUREYES, offering a bid for command at the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive getting rebuffed a furlong out and weakened in the late stages. EIGHT WEEKS LONG
chased along the inside early on, tipped three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and
made no headway. BIG LITTLE RISK broke a half a beat slow, raced along the inside through the first turn before chasing three then four wide, came under
coaxing three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. POLPIS coaxed from the gate, raced three wide through the
first turn establishing the front before spurting away just off the inside down the backstretch, had a flanking pair advance suddenly near the three-eighths
and yielded the front at that station, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. HUMPDAY five wide into the first turn, raced four then three wide through
that bend before giving chase three wide from in range of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and tired. Due to
a timer malfunction the quarter and half mile fractions were hand timed.

Footnotes
CARA'S DREAMER away well, established the top in short order, got guided over to the inside route, showed the way, rating kind and with MON CHERIE in
attendance from the outside, continued onward along the same set up for three-quarters, was put to stronger handling spinning into the lane, extended the
lead to its biggest margin over the course of the next furlong, held on well in the late stages to finish more than sufficiently in the clear. POP THE BUBBLY
underwent a three wide pursuit, got asked for more run after six furlongs had been reeled off, went into the stretch, was staved off. MENDHAM tracked the
pace from just off the rail, angled four wide into the stretch, straightened away and rallied for the show. MON CHERIE prompted the winner from two path
until the end of the second bend, gave way. HOME FOR CHRISTMAS hung out three wide on the clubhouse bend, took up the chase one path closer to the
rail afterwards, came into the stretch and came up empty. MASU chased the pace from the two path, racing rankly during the initial stages, ventured into the
stretch and went on to mainly improve position. SASSY MELISSA kept an eye on CARA'S DREAMER from the pocket, required some urging to keep pace
on the far turn, stepped into the lane and faltered. EAU CLAIRE towards the two path early, travelled three wide on turn two, was in the same path spinning
into the stretch, lacked the necessary response. B C BELLE along the outside throughout, raced three wide on the far turn, got sent out into path five from
upper to midstretch, had no offering. SALUKI stalked the front runners in midpack from path two, angled four wide into the stretch, gave way. GALLINA
saved ground to no avail. BOOMKITTYBYEBYE two wide until the quarter pole, commenced the stretch one path wider, never made her presence felt.

Footnotes
PRINCESS FAWZIA kept watch on the front runners from path two in midpack angled three wide into the stretch, arrived at the three-sixteenths marker and
was given her cue, gained ground on the ones to catch , struck the front end inside the sixteenth pole, kicked away in the final seventy yards. CANDY
FLOWER cut over to the inside route with the advantage, was coaxed along leading the way, feeling some pressure from a pair of opponents parked out
two and three wide respectively for three-quarters, settled in upper stretch before getting set down, yielded reluctantly with slightly less than a sixteenth to
go, kept going with some willingness to save second. OVERHEATED saved ground for over six furlongs, was moved out five wide entering the stretch,
rallied for the show. FLASHING RED took up position in the pocket, sat within range of CANDY FLOWER pulling a bit on the bit early, tipped to the outside
and went on to challenge in the two path stepping onto the top of the lane, flattened out. SHE THROWS HEAT chased the pace from the two path for
three-quarters, slid over to the rail and was let out a notch at the five-sixteenths marker, went into the lane and went on to muster up a mild response.
KITTEN BY THE SEA pursued the pace from along the inside route, closed the gap during the first half of the stretch drive, failed to sustain the momentum,
while appearing to have some, but perhaps not the best of room in the late stages. MICROMILLION underwent a two wide pursuit, commenced the stretch a
couple of paths farther off the rail, made no headway. MORE MANGO guided over to the rail at the three-eighths pole after being mostly two wide prior, cut
the corner into the stretch, made no impact. COME STORMING broke through the gate, but didn't run off, proceeded to come away without apparent
mishap, secured a forward position, forced the issue from path two in between foes for nearly three-quarters, then went at it one on one with the second
place finisher to midstretch before giving way. MY CANDY GIRL three wide, vied as the widest of a threesome for six furlongs, stayed in contention until
midpack and folded. POSITIVE POWER strung out three wide on each of the bend, came up to the whip approaching the five-sixteenths pole, wandered
into the six path stepping into upper stretch, tired. IMPRSSTHEPROFESSOR reserved two wide, gave out.

Footnotes
DURESS chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to close in from the outside taking
command seventy yards from home, then won the bob at the finish to prevail. BOURBON CURRENCY tracked the pace along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, closed well to threaten late and missed at the end. AHEAD OF PLAN hustled from the
gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow command inside the eighth pole,
dug in under threat, got collared seventy yards from home and was along for the show honors. IL PRIMO SOLE (GB) three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly for the last major share. LYNCHBURG chased just off the inside
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. NOTHING BETTER coaxed from the start,
dueled briefly with NOBLE EMOTION before emerging with sole command settling in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled just off the inside
when headed for command near the quarter pole, got set down spinning three wide for home, weakened in the late stages. LAST OPPORTUNITY (IRE)
saved ground in pursuit from near the rear, cut the corner roused into upper stretch and offered no rally. NOBLE EMOTION dueled briefly with NOTHING
BETTER before easing off to track in closest aim just off the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took over command spinning just off the
inside for home, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, weakened in the late going. SHIRAZ broke out at the start and was
corrected, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
GODLOVESASINNER three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled seven wide into upper stretch and weakened.

BEACH FRONT remained forwardly placed after a good start, was guided into the two path, disputed the pace from between rivals for most of the opening
half, got turned loose spinning into the stretch, forged to a slim lead with approximately an eighth to go, ventured on with enough run to inch away from the
second place finisher. MACHO BOY went onto the inside with the advantage, argued as the innermost of three for the opening half, was the last of that
grouping to get turned loose, this occurring a short distance from the three-sixteenths pole, got headed with just under an eighth remaining, fought on but
had to settle for second. PRINCIPAL DANCER contended for the top from path three as the widest of three until midstretch before weakening.
DANGEROUS EDGE took up the chase from path two, got sent out to the outside for racing room, launched a six wide rally down the lane for the final
significant slice of the purse. CHARGE AHEAD three wide onto the turn, was four wide exiting it, lacked the needed closing punch. LARCENY sat reserved
two wide for the opening half in midpack, angled five wide into the stretch, mustered up a mild response. NUMBER ONE DILLON hung out four to five wide
on the turn, fanned out into path seven from upper to midstretch, made no impact. BLUES CITY bumped lightly with BANK GALA after losing his footing
springing from the gate, travelled three wide on the turn, got maneuvered all the way into path eight during the stretch run to no avail. OUR AMERICAN
STAR cut over to the rail nearing the conclusion of the backstretch, went three wide into the lane, never made its presence felt. I SAW IT ALL four wide at
the top of the turn, was in the same one at the top of the stretch, tired. BANK GALA got corrected after coming out at the start, but not before some contact
with his next stall neighbor, raced in the two path on the turn, was ridden four wide into the stretch, failed to menace. NO MORE MIRACLES saved ground
for a half, tipped into the two path at the head of the stretch, backed away. FREEDOM FORCE along the rail, was through by the five-sixteenths marker.
RIGHTDOWNGENTLEMEN stacked five wide on the bend, folded.
