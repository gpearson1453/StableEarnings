Footnotes
PEYTON ELIZABETH bobbled at the break, stalked close up outside, bid two wide on the far turn, dug in gamely outside of BRAVO REGINA in the stretch
drive, wore down that rival and edged away, driving. BRAVO REGINA set the pace racing with a clear early lead, showed the way into the far turn, dueled
with the winner passing the quarter pole, dug in gamely inside of that rival in midstretch, then came up second best. INFATUATING tracked along the inside,
chased inside on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and finished evenly. KUBIE SNACKS stalked two wide, chased two wide on the far turn and lacked
a rally. ASK AROUND raced two wide off the pace and failed to respond. CELESTIAL PRIDE raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

Footnotes
TIZ A SHARPIE was outrun early, rallied strongly around foes on the final turn and took the lead near the quarter pole, extended mid stretch and won under
strong handling. GO METRO GIRL was blocked behind horses near the quarter pole, found room between foes and was drawing away from the rest.
AFRICAN SONG raced very wide while just off the pace and tired. GROOVE, in the five path while not far back, tired. MEGALOMANIA dueled for command
three wide before giving way. TWEETY KITTEN showed little. STAY SALTY vied for command between foes, steadied briefly near quarter pole and fell
back. DON'TTOUCHMYSTUFF raced wide and failed to menace. BETTER BEGIN saved ground and was never a serious threat. OUR CLAIRE BEAR
saved ground dueling for the lead, lost action and steadied near quarter pole while dropping back then was eased through the stretch. A CLAIM OF FOUL
BY THE RIDER OF OUR CLAIR BEAR AGAINST STAY SALTY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE QUARTER POLE WAS DISMISSED.

SHES EUPHORIC was between foes early, went three wide on the final turn, moved closer to rail in early stretch then was steered out again through deep
stretch and was along in time. PASATIME was bumped leaving the gate, raced three wide chasing, angled in on the final turn, moved out again into stretch,
drifted out, took the lead but was outfinished. LEFTATTHEALTAR raced well off the rail, opened a long lead, relinquished that lead in early stretch but held
on well. MUCHA SUERTE raced two wide early then three wide on the final turn while well placed then faded late. START NOTIZING, just off the rail, came
out and bumped HOT LITTLE NUMBER entering the stretch. R AWESUM BETTY raced wide and failed to menace. TINY TURBO ducked in leaving the
gate, saved ground and tired. HOT LITTLE NUMBER raced wide and was bumped soundly on the final turn. ALMOST EVIL was bumped then clipped heels
and stumbled after the start, raced wide and was bumped again on the final turn. MISS JASSER, wide, failed to menace. PRINCESS MARISOL was also
wide and never a threat. GUMDROP'S CHICLET stumbled start at the start and then came out and bumped PASATIME into ALMOST EVIL, dueled three
