Footnotes
JEWEL dueled for command outside GEM THIEF, gained the upper hand approaching the stretch, kicked clear through the furlong grounds and held firm to
the finish. VIVI'S DREAM'S tracked the dueling leaders into the turn, shifted out three wide with aim outside JEWEL past the quarter-pole, could not reach
her and was best of the others. GEM THIEF contested the pace inside JEWEL for the better part of three furlongs, and weakened in the stretch. BLUE EYE
KITTEN broke slowly, angled wide leaving the turn, and posed no threat. NAG NAG NAG failed to factor. ANGEL EMBRACE lacked the needed response
two wide. BABY ANA dropped far back approaching the stretch, and jogged in.

Footnotes
FREELANCE set a clear pace along the rail and held clear under a drive. EXXTOP hit the gate, chased the pace three wide, never threatened the winner
but outfinished a foe for the place. MASTER Q tracked the winner two wide, could not gain on the that foe in the lane and was outfinished for second. NONA
RAC had early speed inside, dropped back around the turn, lightly steadied near the five-sixteenths pole and passed some tiring rivals inside in the lane.
MORNING TRIAL steadied near the five-eighths pole, advanced two wide around the turn, angled four wide near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead
in the lane and lacked a closing bid. GLOBALTROUBLECOCO failed to menace while racing two wide. CON PERMISO steadied faded while racing three
and four wide. COMPASS CAY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
TIL THE END was outrun early, moved out rallying through the furlong grounds, and was up in time on the far outside. MONY was never far back, lodged a
bid in the three-path through the stretch, reached a short lead outside rivals late, but was nailed at the finish. FREEDOM MATTERS tracked outside J P
HELLISH to the stretch, and stayed on stubbornly along the inside late. SUBLIME APPEAL tracked three wide, took over in upper stretch, but was outkicked
to the wire. CERRADO saved ground outrun early, moved off the inside approaching the stretch, and passed tired horses. NETTLETON was no factor
inside. CAPTAIN D bumped with J P HELLISH and steadied back at the start, went into the first turn four wide, and never reached contention. HE'S ONE
WILD DUDE raced in the second flight two to three wide, and lacked a response. J P HELLISH bumped with CAPTAIN D at the start, moved inside coming
away with the lead on the first turn, set an even pace for a half-mile, and faded steadily into the stretch. VALIANT APPEAL raced three to four wide, and
was finished soon after going a half.

Footnotes
TONY SMALL was bumped at the start, raced well back inside down the backstretch, made progress at the rail rounding the turn, angled three wide near
the quarter pole, was floated out to the center of the track in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the lane and was up and clear late. YES FOR
LESS settled off the pace along the inside, tipped out to bid two wide near the quarter pole, was floated out in upper stretch, took the lead leaving the
three-sixteenths pole, finished willingly but was unable to stave off the winner. MONEY HOUSE was pinched back at the start, saved ground well back and
finished well inside of the top two. PRICEY VICTORY was off slow, advanced inside down the backstretch, took the lead inside entering the turn, drew clear
nearing the lane, drifted out turning for home, continued on the left lead and tired. POWER (BRZ) played no factor while racing four wide. RODEO RED
chased the pace two wide between foes, angled in nearing the lane and lacked a closing bid. SLIPPY was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide
and came up empty in the lane. HAPPY DANZA vied for the early lead outside of SEATBELT, stopped nearing the turn, was eased up in the lane and
passed his pace rival. SEATBELT set the early pace two wide, stopped and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
VENEZUELAN HUG broke slow and lagged well back for a half-mile, edged closer two wide after six furlongs, encountered traffic through upper stretch,
bumped with MAX K. O. slicing through a seam between horses a furlong out, edged away near the hedge and staved off SECOND MATE to the wire.
SECOND MATE saved ground unhurried early, swung four wide approaching the stretch, rallied steadily and just missed outside the winner. SCRAPS
settled in midpack early, advanced off the far turn near the four-path, loomed through the furlong grounds outside MONFORTE, and was outkicked from
there. MUGGSAMATIC went along in the second flight to the stretch, and made no impact on the far outside. GALLEON MAST was a step slow to begin,
raced two wide and failed to menace. SASSY BUT SMART stayed in range near the two-path to the far turn, and lacked the needed closing response.
MONFORTE led early but backed off and tracked HERO UP and SIR SEAMUS from outside, took over outside the latter after six furlongs, then weakened
through the furlong grounds to a host of challengers. MAX K. O. eyed the leaders four then three wide for a half, stayed close to the stretch, bumped with
the eventual winner near the eighth-pole and gave way. SIR SEAMUS contested the early pace between horses, moved inside leaving the backstretch,
relinquished command to MONFORTE around the far turn, and tired. HERO UP contested the early pace inside, and gave way after a half-mile.

DIAL TO WIN set a clear pace in the two path and widened under moderate urging. DEEMED ESSENTIAL raced off the pace two wide down the
backstretch, angled four wide and was put to a drive nearing the five-sixteenths pole, had aim in upper stretch but was no match for the winner while
finishing well clear of the rest. THE JOKES ON ME bobbled a bit a at the start, chased the pace inside and lacked a rally. MIZZEN stalked the pace three
wide and came up empty in the lane. CANARY failed to menace while racing two wide. GILDED ASSET broke a awkwardly, saved ground and played no
factor. DANCE AWHILE chased four wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
INTHEWINNERSCIRCLE bumped with BEACH CHICK at the start, settled well off the pace two wide to the far turn, shifted out to the four-path getting in
gear leaving the quarter-pole, rallied steadily outside and edged away through the last 70 yards. YAFA pressed the pace three then two wide, took over
outside SPECIAL INCLUSION after six furlongs, could not withstand the winner in deep stretch but stayed on well. DOUBLE BLESSED saved ground on
the turns, loomed a threat along the hedge with a furlong remaining, but was outfinished. QUINOA TIFAH pressed the pace inside to the stretch, and
weakened through the last eighth of a mile. SWEET SOUPER SWEET saved ground to the far turn, had the two-path into the lane, and lacked the needed
closing response. EMIRATES AFFAIR swung five wide approaching the stretch, and made no headway. VIVA LA REINA stayed in range for six furlongs,
and faded. TANTALIZING GAL raced four wide in range to the top of the stretch, and gave way. SPECIAL INCLUSION took a short early lead between
horses, cleared off and moved inside after a half-mile, got collared by YAFA on the far turn, and faltered. BEACH CHICK bumped with
INTHEWINNERSCIRCLE and became rank tossing her head around at the break, remained hard to handle far back into the first turn, and showed little
thereafter.

Footnotes
YOUNG RAYMOND tracked the duel from the two path, angled four wide turning for home, swept to the front leaving the eighth pole and powered clear
while ridden out. SLICK STAR pressed the pace three wide, reached near even terms approaching the lane, vied to midstretch, was no match for the winner
late but battled on gamely to earn the nod for the place. MONEY COME dueled along the rail, drifted out a bit turning for home, led to midstretch and was
narrowly outfinished for the place. STEADILY saved ground off the pace and improved position. DON H dueled two wide, turned for home on even terms
between rivals and weakened. GATOR FIFTY TWO saved ground off the pace, angled out nearing the lane, lugged in under right-handed urging in upper
stretch and faded. MORE THAN USUAL failed to menace while racing four wide.

Footnotes
MISTER LEONARDO bumped with GO MIKE at the start, saved ground allowed to settle in midpack early, shifted out three wide approaching the stretch,
responded readily and blew past HEAVENLY BLESSING from outside near the sixteenth-pole to win going away. GO MIKE bumped with MISTER
LEONARDO at the start, saved ground on the turns in striking range, moved off the hedge a furlong out and was up outside for the place. HANGAR ONE
prompted the pace outside HEAVENLY BLESSING to the stretch, and weakened through the late stages. HEAVENLY BLESSING cleared to the early lead,
rated along inside to the stretch, remained with a daylight advantage coming to the eighth-pole, then gave way. FITZ'S MO got out badly while keyed up
entering the first turn, moved inside up the backstretch, and was empty when roused. UNCLE PIP was four wide and prevented from moving inward by the
antics of FITZ'S MO entering the first turn, and never reached contention. TIZ THE DUDE raced three to four wide throughout, and tired nearing the stretch.
BACH was four wide early, and never became prominent. EXIT RIGHT steadied behind FITZ'S MO entering the first turn, and was always well back.
