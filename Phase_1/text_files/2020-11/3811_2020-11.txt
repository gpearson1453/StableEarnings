Footnotes
CROWNN THESS showed good speed and set the pace, moved clear near the nine-sixteenths, drew off in the three path on the turn, responded well in the
stretch and proved much the best under strong urging. LAPCOS LEGACY raced just off the early pace, was shuffled back behind a retreating foe near the
nine-sixteenths, raced inside on the turn, steadied while lacking room at the quarter-pole, altered out near the furlong marker and finished willingly for the
place. LIKE MOULIN ROUGE raced just off the pace, dropped back in the three to four path on the turn and weakened but clearly earned the show. NILLA
raced up close to the pace, moved up more around the nine-sixteenths, was urged along in the two path on the turn and tired. TA MY VIRGULE broke out
and bumped with a foe, saved ground off the pace and failed to threaten. AA FILTHY RICH raced well back in the field, dropped from the four path to the
two path on the turn and was no factor. WMA GRAND CENTRAL raced just off the pace, dropped back while five wide on the turn and retreated.
PISTOLINE ducked out sharply at the start, fell back on the outside and faltered. WMA BARN OWL broke awkwardly and bumped with a foe at the start,
angled out near the five-eighths, went five wide on the turn and also faltered. RB BLYTZ broke in at the start, pressed the pace for a quarter-mile then
retreated.
