Footnotes
DUNCASTLE established control in short order, rated kind showing the way from along the inside route, was in the general area of the three-sixteenths
marker when called upon for more, gave the desired response to stave off all comers. DOWSE'S BEACH strung out four wide in midpack, was in the same
one spinning into the stretch, rallied down the center of the course to garner the place. WAR STROLL pursued the pace from path two on the turn, got sent
out five wide from upper to midstretch, finished willingly to earn the show award. IAN GLASS forwardly placed three wide, flattened out in the final furlong.
THE QUEENS JULES underwent a two wide journey, went into the stretch and lacked the necessary response. OUTRAGEOUS BET took up the chase
from path three, got maneuvered seven wide early during the stretch drive, made no impact. DR. SHANE cut over to the rail coming up the top of the turn,
was angled three wide into the stretch, had no offering. ANOTHER tracked the winner from along the inside route, firmly held during the initial stages, cut
the corner into the lane then failed to fire appreciably. NEW YORK'S FINEST taken hold of after losing his footing springing from the starting gate, prompted
the pace from path two, in between rivals for much of the run around the bend, stepped onto the head of the stretch and backed away steadily.
HONORABLE HERO three to four wide on the turn, was more the latter heading home, tired.

Footnotes
VACAY coaxed from the gate, chased four wide, got set down spinning five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, drew
clear under a drive kept to task. ROSSA VELOCE bobbled at the break and brushed with PART AT PAGE'S, pressed the leader from the outside two then
three wide, took over command nearing the quarter pole, went three then two wide into upper stretch straightened away, dug in and was collared near the
eighth pole, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. PARTY AT PAGE'S got brushed at the start by the
aforementioned foe while under hustling, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the
late stages. CHASING CARA hustled from the start, showed the way lightly coaxed along the inside under pressure from ROSSA VELOCE to the outside,
got urged near the five-sixteenths, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened in the final furlong.
SHANES PRETTY LADY chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn lightly coaxed along
from the half mile pole, angled six wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GLYNN COUNTY unhurried while taking the inside route, slipped into the two path at the three-eighths pole, began a steady advance towards the ones to
catch, got called upon as three-quarters was being completed, angled five wide for the drive, maintained its momentum and closed the gap, overhauled a
plethora of rivals in the final stages to prove best. SIDD FINCH loosely pocketed tracking the front runners, was let out a notch coming up to the
five-sixteenths pole, having fallen back a bit as the tempo quickened, tipped into path two at the head of the stretch, flashed good energy in the final seventy
yards to get up for second. REJECTED AGAIN prompted STANHOPE from path two, challenged in earnest at the quarter pole, forged to the front end with
approximately a sixteenth to go, but with a swarm of others in hot pursuit, gave in to that heavy pressure soon afterwards, salvaged the show. OUR
COUNTRY was primarily in the two path taking up the chase, spun four wide into the stretch, was part of a big blanket of equines battling for an
in-the-money slot in deep stretch, came up short. STANHOPE off to an alert beginning, cut over to the rail with the advantage, was held in reserve carving
out the pace, accompanied by REJECTED AGAIN from the outside, got called upon being put to the test by that opponent leaving the five-sixteenths pole,
relinquished in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole after having put up a good fight then weakened. MADE MY DAY (IRE) pursued the pace from path two,
commenced the stretch one farther off the inside, lacked the necessary response. LIFE ON TOP guided over to the rail at the crown of the clubhouse turn,
remained stationed there until the end of the second bend, swung out two wide onto the top of the lane, had no offering. TILL THEN faltered after
undergoing a ground-saving journey.

late stages while clear for the show honors. DESPEIGHT ALL ODDS broke a beat slow and conceded three to four lengths to the front before settling into
stride, chased along the inside coaxed along from the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position. SOUPSTER three
to four wide down the backstretch, chased three wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and tired. TEMPER

Footnotes
MALIBU PRO forwardly placed after a good beginning, departed the backstretch from the three path, crept up to the leader as three-quarters was being
rattled off, had already grabbed away the advantage when asked for more deep into the furlong grounds, moved a bit wider yet gave the desired response
to stay in the clear. CONTROL GROUP at a considerable distance off the rail throughout, travelled four wide on the turn, got ridden into the stretch, shifted a
bit wider after the winner did shortly afterwards, got staved off. AMERICAN RULE tracked the front runners from along the inside route, pulling a bit on the
left all the while, cut the corner into the lane and went no to secure the show. AMERICAN LINCOLN pursued the pace from path two, hard ridden for most of
the trip on the turn, angled one path farther off the rail into the lane, lacked the necessary response. GIO D'ORO cut over to the rail early on the backstretch
after having established the top, got rated showing the way, accompanied by FLOWERS FOR LISA from the outside, saw the winner increase his presence
as the third fraction was about to be finalized, got roused in response, yielded soon afterwards, then steadily backed away. FLOWERS FOR LISA prompted
the pace from path two until the five-sixteenths pole, folded.

Footnotes
VITESSE tracked the pace from the pocket, firmly rated during the initial stages, launched hid bid along the clear rail corridor as three-quarters was being
completed, wrested away the advantage with about a sixteenth to go and edged clear. BEACHSIDE at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout,
travelled four wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path wider, fought its way to the front end albeit narrowly by midlane, was under right side stick
work trying to dig in, under pressure from both sides, came out slightly in the general area of the sixteenth pole when switched to a hand drive, right after
QUINTARELLI had itself had been worked a bit closer to the rail with his pilot applying stick work from the right side, bumped with opponent, resulting in
VITESSE cementing himself to the top for good, ventured onward to be the second to cross the finish line. QUINTARELLI took up the chase three wide on
the turn, fanned out into path six for good racing room in the stretch, vied with vigour for the advantage, began to shift closer to the rail when put to right side
pressure in the last eighth, made contact with an incoming BEACHSIDE a sixteenth later, recovered and stayed on well. FOTIS two wide onto the turn, got
sent out four wide exiting it, made no headway late. MY AMANJENA parked out five wide on the turn, left the eighth pole parked out eight wide, had no rally.
KING OF AMERICAN hit the left side of the gate after breaking in the air, was hustled along the chute to get going, cut over to the rail approaching the
conclusion of the backstretch, got ridden two wide into the stretch, improved position. GLENN LIKES GIN pursued the pace two to three wide on the turn,
got sent out into path seven during the stretch run, failed to make impact. HONORABLE AVENUE showed the way from along the two path, gave in after
coming under siege at the quarter pole. DUBLIN GREEN prompted the pace three wide, spun into the lane from between rivals, remained a prominent
factor for a few additional jumps before giving way. Following a Stewards; Inquiry in addition to a claim of foul lodged by the rider of QUINTARELLI against
the rider of BEACHSIDE, the latter was disqualified from second and placed third for causing interference.

DUOPOLY established the top prior to leaving the homestretch, was rated along at or near the two path setting split after split after split, spun into the lane
and after having its pilot take a peek back was given her cue in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker, dug in with good determination to hold sway.
HIGH OPINION underwent a three wide journey until the end of the second bend, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths pole, commenced the stretch
slightly wider, narrowed in on the one to catch en route for place honors. VIGILANTES WAY stalked the winner from path two, going about the task from
between foes for nearly six furlongs, angled three wide for the drive, fought well but had to settle for the show. SPEAKTOMEOFSUMMER was patiently
ridden keeping an eye on the pace from along the inside route, slipped into the two path at the three-eighths pole, paused in hand behind some traffic at the
quarter pole, got maneuvered into path three and was given her cue, altered course into the five path in midstretch, rallied mildly afterwards. SELFLESSLY
reserved two wide during the opening stages, took up the chase three wide on the far turn, got called upon as three-quarters was being completed, swung
out into path four heading onto the top of the lane, failed to fire appreciably. CRYSTALLE tucked into the two path, stayed put for over six furlongs, got
steered out five wide in the stretch, launched no bids. FACCIO IO (GB) forwardly placed along the inside route, rated unkind early, kept pace with the winner
for six furlongs, stepped into the stretch and faltered.

PROSPECT MOUNTAIN stumbled at the start splaying his legs and recovered conceding four to five lengths immediately at the start, strode a bit green
early on before settling into stride chasing four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch from the tail of the field, continued four to five wide through
the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced near the quarter pole and swung five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied and was directed
out tipping out a bit greenly a furlong from home as BOWING SNOWMAN shied in front, closed well to collar the top trio seventy yards from home and
prevailed edged away at the end. BOWING SNOWMAN three to four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to knock heads with DEVIOUS MO nearing the eighth pole and shied out under at that station, dug in taking
narrow and brief command a sixteenth from home before being displaced by the eventual winner and kept on to secure the place honors. NOCTILUCENT
bumped at the start by TOM'S CHOICE who broke inwards, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick closing outside to secure the show honors. DEVIOUS MO just off the pace in pursuit two to three wide, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow command three-sixteenths from home, dug in under challenge from
flanking threats, got headed a sixteenth out and then was outfinished in the late stages. DEE BO forwardly placed along the inside, advanced to take over
command three furlongs from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, dug in and was collared at the
three-sixteenths, fought on inside to the sixteenth marker, then got outfinished in the late going. DOUBLEPOUR three then two wide in pursuit, came under
a ride at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. DAGGERBOARD chased just off the inside under coaxing
from the three-eighths, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. CAPE COD
GEM established the front crossing to show the way in hand three then two wide, had DEE BO advance inside and was headed for command at the
three-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and weakened in the stretch. SILVERADO TRAIL broke in at the start
and was corrected, chased along the inside coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. PRINCE ORB got
bumped at the start by TOM'S CHOICE breaking in and was pinched back against NOCTILUCENT, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. IN THE ZONE bobbled at
the break, chased four then three wide coaxed along from three furlongs out, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. TOM'S
CHOICE broke in at the start bumping PRINCE ORB into NOCTILUCENT and pinching back PRINCE ORB, chased five paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the turn under a ride from midway, went five wide for home and tired.
