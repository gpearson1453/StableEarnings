HONEY PARADE chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane, was under a long drive in the final stages and prevailed at
the wire. RAINTREE STARLET set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, inched clear in the stretch but was put under a long drive in the final stages
and finally caught at the wire. LA FEMME ROYALE pressed the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. HETTY
G. was unprepared at the start, raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane and lacked a late gain in the stretch drive. VIOLATION broke

Footnotes
HOISTTHEMAINSAIL was bothered early on, stalked the pace, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch, drifted out a bit, was under a
long drive late and edged past the leader in the final stages. STORMING LION shied from the shadow of the big board along the backstretch, took over
command near the five sixteenths pole, was in the three path into the lane, inched clear near the eighth pole but was put under a long drive late and gave in
nearing the wire but was second best. BEEBOO set the pace early on, was overtaken near the five sixteenths pole, raced off the rail into the lane and
faltered in the stretch run. CIRCUS broke a bit awkwardly at the start, raced along the outside, shied from the shadow of the big board along the
backstretch, was in the four path into the lane and came again late in the stretch drive. PILOT PRINCE was bothered early on, raced along the four path into
the lane and faded late in the stretch run. AMES MISTER was bothered early on and trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
BRIEFCASE BULLY tracked from midpack two wide and between horses while in range of the leading duelers, shifted three wide into the turn, tracked
behind leading foes through the turn before tipping to the five path at the quarter pole, quickened to produce a bid in upper stretch, kicked clear approaching
the furlong pole, and was ridden out to the wire. CARMICHAEL stalked along the inside down the backstretch, shifted two wide at the three furlong marker
to pass a tiring early pace setter, tracked from behind the leaders and inside of BRIEFCASE BULLY around the turn, but waited behind foes in upper
stretch, which allowed the aforementioned foe to get a jump, shifted in passing the three sixteenths pole, then rallied along the rail to forge place passing the
sixteenth pole without threatening the winner. THRILL RIDE broke a bit outwards and lied forwardly placed while well outside of his immediate inner foe,
shifted down to the three path to vie outside of a pair of foes into the turn, forged an advantage turning for home, but proved no match for an outer rallying
rival approaching the furlong pole, and got surpassed for place in the late stages. IMPERIAL CONFLICT tracked from midpack while kept very wide through
the backstretch, shifted down to the four path into the turn, inched closer to bid passing the five sixteenths pole, but flattened out while getting outkicked by
an outer foe in upper stretch. CAPT. MAESTRI was outrun early on, and passed tired foes in the lane. BRAZILLIONAIRE dueled for the lead two wide, then
inside of a pair of foes at the five sixteenths pole, but weakened in upper stretch. OL GREY GHOST dueled for the lead along the inside, but gave way
without rider encouragement passing the three furlong pole, and was eased thereafter.

Footnotes
ANGKOR lied close up to the pace along the inside down the backstretch, effortlessly split dueling foes to vie for the lead two wide and between horses at
the three furlong pole, dueled turning for home and through upper stretch as SKIP INTRO dug in, but kicked away from that foe passing the furlong pole,
and widened under driving pressure. SKIP INTRO dueled for the lead inside of several foes around the turn, dug in to hold an advantage in upper stretch,
but was bested and proved no match for his immediate outer counterpart passing the furlong pole, then held place while tiring. UNITEDANDRESOLUTE
perched himself outside of foes in the four path, vied four wide around the turn, but failed to keep pace with a pair of inner rivals passing the three sixteenths
pole, then leveled off to secure show while making mild progress on place late. TEST OF WILL tracked from midpack two wide early on, cut the corner
turning for home, and chased the leaders from along the rail through the lane. RACARINO raced off of the pace three wide around the turn, shifted to the
five path turning for home, but chased leading rivals without gaining. SWOT ANALYSIS dueled for the lead two wide early on while staying in the three path,
then dueled three wide and in between horses around the turn, but weakened at the quarter pole. CONVENTION hesitated at the start, raced far off of the
pace along the inside, and never got involved. KING OF THE NITE saved ground off of the pace, and never got involved. DETERMINED TO RISE was
outrun throughout, and showed little. Due to a timer malfunction, no fractional times are available, but the final time was electrically timed.

VIOLENT CITY stalked the trio of duelers along the inside down the backstretch, awaited racing room while tipping to the three path turning for home, split
foes in upper stretch to produce a bid for the lead inside of leading foes at the furlong pole, and edged clear of them in the final sixteenth. BREAKING
NEWS raced off of the pace two wide, took the turn in the three to four path before swinging to the six path turning for home, rallied outside of the leader to
bid for the lead at the furlong pole, but was outkicked by an inner foe passing that marker, then just reached place at the wire. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK vied
for the lead three wide, forged an advantage and cleared inner rivals approaching the quarter pole, but drifted out subtly through upper stretch, got headed
by an inner foe passing the furlong pole, then was nailed on the wire by an outer foe for place. ANSWER IN pulled while rank and uncontrollably advanced
inside of foes to be just behind the leading group, steadied into the turn and lost position to trail the field by the three furlong pole, pulled left while cutting the
corner turning for home, then shifted to the seven path at the three sixteenths pole to be outside of rivals, and rallied, but did not have enough to catch the
leaders. FULL AUTHORITY advanced to midpack while five wide into the turn, held that path through the bend, and tired in upper stretch without menacing.
ENERGIZER dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but gave way in upper stretch. KADRI advanced from midpack to lie in range of the leaders
four wide and between horses around the turn, but tired in upper stretch. THE BIG S dueled for the lead inside of foes, but gave way at the quarter pole.
Due to a timer malfunction, no internal fractions are available, and the final time was hand timed.

Footnotes
SINGITA DREAMS stalked two wide, vied around the far turn with a narrow advantage, but spooked at the quarter pole, drifted into CASH OUT's path in the
process, then kicked clear in upper stretch, and widened under driving pressure in the late stages. CASH OUT tracked from midpack two wide, inched
closer three wide around the far turn to attempt a bid turning for home, but was bothered by the leader at the quarter pole, then proved no match for that foe
in upper stretch, chased that foe through the lane, and held place from an inner rival. ROMANTIC PURSUIT mildly bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked
along the inside, shifted two wide tuning for home, then chased the leader through the lane while failing to catch an outer foe for place, and was vanned off.
GOLDEN CURL raced far off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the three to four path, and failed to factor. WAR ROSE set the pace along the inside,
but was headed by the eventual winner passing the three furlong pole, and gave way in upper stretch. GAMBLIN TRAIN was outrun. Following the race, the
rider of CASH OUT claimed foul against the rider of SINGITA DREAMS for interference at the quarter pole. The objection was sustained by the Stewards;
SINGITA DREAMS was disqualified and placed second. Due to a timer malfunction, no internal fractions are available and the final time was hand-timed.

MONTE NE dueled for the lead two wide, forged an advantage turning for home as SMART CALL made a bid, battled through the lane with that foe latched
on to his hind quarter, drifted out subtly through the final furlong and brushed that foe at the sixteenth pole, then held safely. SMART CALL stalked two wide
and between horses from the three path, inched closer turning for home to bid for the lead at the quarter pole outside of MONTE NE, latched on while
leaning on that foe's hind quarters through upper stretch, then got mildly brushed by that foe at the sixteenth pole, and failed to reach him late. JACK LUVS
NOVA lied forwardly placed three wide and between horses while in the four path around the turn, but proved no match for a pair of inner foes in upper
stretch. FUGITIVE dueled for the lead along the inside, but failed to keep pace passing the quarter pole, and gave way through the final furlong. CANOE
saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the three path turning for home, and failed to menace. SECRET MOVE stalked along the inside, saved ground
around the turn, but to no avail. WINGING WAYS hopped a bit at the start, chased four wide while in the five path, but tired turning for home. AHMAS was
off slowly, raced far off of the pace along the inside while under urging, and never got involved. MAXED UP was outrun and showed little. Following the
race, the rider of SMART CALL claimed foul against the rider of MONTE NE for interference in deep stretch, and the Stewards posted an inquiry. The
objection was upheld by the Stewards; MONTE NE was disqualified and placed second. Due to a timer malfunction, no internal fractions are available, and
the final time was hand-timed.
