Footnotes
FORBIDDEN FRUIT stalked the pacesetters from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane, quickly cleared when straightening then widened through
the final eighth. FRENCH VANILLA vied for the early lead while off the inside, cleared into the turn when still in the two path, briefly dueled with the winner
into the lane, was no match for that one but stayed on to settle for second best. SECOND EXCHANGE chased the pace from the three or four path through
the turn, moved four wide into the lane, could not gain on the top ones but remained clear for the show spot. FIRST SQUADRON was in a bit tight and
steadied nearing the half-mile pole, raced near the inside through the turn and lacked a response. BEAUTILICIOUS was in the four path through the turn,
came into the lane from the seven path and never was a factor. SALTED REVENGE never a menace while in the two path through the turn. PROPER SHE
IS vied for the lead early while along the inside, chased the pace through the turn and was empty entering the lane.

IT'S MANDATORY stalked then pressed the pace while two wide into the far turn, bid two wide in late turn, quickly gained the lead into the lane then drew
away. ROUNDER chased the pace while along the inside through the turns, moved up for the place and finished well clear for the place spot. DRAW THE
LINE was along the inside through the turns and just got up for the show spot. WEEKEND IN COURT chased the pace from the three path through the turn
and into the lane then tired. CHARCOAL set the pace while near the inside into late turn, was put under pressure near the quarter pole then gave way.
RELMBUNKUS SYR was steadied between rivals at the start, raced well back into the first turn, continued to trail into the far turn and never was a factor
while passing a couple tired ones. PAINTSVILLE was in the two path through the turns and was empty turning into the lane. EVENINGWITHBERNIE was
done after traveling a half while in the two path.

RIA MUNK vied for the lead with one then two others entering the far turn, remained under pressure while repelling one challenger into the lane, dueled with
the other inside the eighth pole and gamely edged up late. LIRAZ stalked then pressed the pace three wide into the far turn, remained on near even terms
swinging into the lane, was head and head with the winner with a sixteenth to go then could not keep up late. LADY OXBOW chased the pace from the two
path through the far turn, angled into the four path near the eighth pole then could not gain while settling for the show spot. STRAITOUTTAPOPCORN vied
for the lead from between rivals through late turn then gave way to the top two entering the lane. BIRDACIOUS raced in the four path through the far turn
when never far back then lacked a closing response. TWO SIXTYONE was checked early when in tight, raced in the two path through the turns and never
was a factor. BARREL OF DESTINY chased the pace into the backstretch while in the three path then steadily faded. TALE OF PERFECT LA was checked

Footnotes
VIVIAN chased the pace from the four path through the turn, came into the lane from mid-track, bid seven wide near the eighth pole, cleared soon after and
stayed. NIECE JACKIE DAVIS was unhurried while in the two path into the lane, angled into the five path and appeared to be angling wider when path
closed, split rivals near the eighth pole while five wide and chased the winner to the wire. APRON STRINGS settled early, moved five wide in late turn,
swung into the lane from the six path, was on near even terms for the top spot while a furlong to go then could not match the top two while best of the rest.
CHRISTIAN MISS chased the pace from between rivals through the turn, remained a serious threat with an eighth to go then weakened. HOPPESTRY
chased the pace three wide into the turn, continued three wide into the lane when a serious threat then weakened. TROPHY DOLL (IRE) chased the pace
while along the inside through the turn, was a contender with an eighth to go then tired. LUCY TOO set the pace from the two path into late turn then gave
way entering the lane. QUITE A BABE was squeezed at the start, raced in the three to four path through the turn and was never in it. CHARMING JILLY B
was outrun while in the five path.

Footnotes
KRUNCH pressed the pace three wide through the turn, was asked for more in late turn, quickly cleared into the lane then drew away while being kept to the
task. ANGEL AT WAR chased the pace four wide through the turn, continued to chase the winner through the lane from the five path and could only gain
the place spot late. PICANTE CALIENTE vied for the lead along the inside through the turn, was no match for the winner then lost the place spot late. TIA
FLOR raced in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and was never a threat through the lane. SUGARSUGARSUGAR was
along the inside through the turn and never was a factor. GIFT WRAPPED was a bit fractious and was resetting when gates opened, hopped outward at the
start and bumped rival, raced near the inside through the turn and was never in it. JE SUIS BELLE vied for the early lead while two wide into the turn then
steadily faded. CREATIVE CREDIT was bumped solidly at the start and lost rider, raced riderless while remaining clear of others and was eventually walked
off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY IN TO THE BEGINNING OF THE RACE FOUND NO REASON FOR CHANGE OF ORDER.

Footnotes
ROOSTER stalked the pace while in the three path into the turn, bid near mid-turn, cleared before the quarter pole, continued on a clear lead into the lane
then widened to the wire. RUSHED was unhurried while off the inside, rushed up four to five wide into the turn, got closest to the winner after mid-turn then
chased that one to the wire to be second best. C JS BILLY BYU unhurried while saving ground, continued along the rail through the turn when others
fanned wide, cut the corner into the lane and moved up for the minor share. CLOSE THE CASE was in the two or three path through the turn when never far
back, asked into the lane and flattened out a bit late. CONQUEST STORMY was in the two path when gaining a short lead into the far turn, continued near
the inside into the lane then weakened. WHEREWEGOIN was in the three path through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the five path
and never was a threat. BAHNKE was unhurried done the backstretch, moved six wide into the turn when gaining momentum, continued wide through
mid-turn and tired after straightening in the lane. D'ARK FLATTER saved ground to no avail. WICKED SLIDER was in the three path into the far turn when
never far back and was suddenly done. CRAFTY SPECTOR set the pace then chased into the turn and was done near the three-eighths pole.
