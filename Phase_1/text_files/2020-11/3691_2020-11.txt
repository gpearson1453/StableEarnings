Footnotes
CALLMESENORITA was outrun early, moved up inside through the middle stages, found room rallying on the rail through upper stretch, took over into the
final furlong and drove clear. CAPTURED LIGHT steadied heading into the first turn behind TAYLOR'S FIRST, saved ground into the far turn within striking
distance, angled out in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals for the place. BENNY'S GIRLFRIEND set the pace inside, drifted out several paths leaving the
three-sixteenths pole, and ran on to salvage the show. MADAME MOON saved ground early, lodged a three-wide bid on the far turn, and flattened out in the
stretch. NATURELL (ECU) prompted the pace outside BENNY'S GIRLFRIEND for six furlongs, and weakened in upper stretch. U S S LOIS went into the
first turn four wide, and never made her presence felt. SIGNING BONUS raced three wide, and was always outrun. TAYLOR'S FIRST showed speed four
then three wide around the first turn, stopped into the far turn and jogged in far behind.

Footnotes
MILES AHEAD settled off the pace outside, advanced four then three wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, took the lead leaving the
eighth pole, briefly drew clear and just lasted. ALL AROUND lagged well back inside, swung out near the quarter pole, closed outside and ran out of ground.
ROUGH ENTRY set the pace along the rail, drew clear around the turn, led past the eighth pole and weakened through the final furlong. LIFE IN
SHAMBLES chased the pace three wide between foes and lacked a closing bid. EXAMINER stalked the pace two wide, angled in nearing the lane and
came up empty in the drive. STRONG ENDING raced off the pace in tight quarters between rivals down the backstretch, steadied near the three-eighths
pole and faded four wide. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF STRONG ENDING AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE
NEAR THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
BALISTICO waited behind the leaders around the turn, shifted off the inside past the quarter-pole, bid outside MALRAUX through the stretch, and edged
past late. MALRAUX set the early pace inside, was steered out several paths through upper stretch, and yielded grudgingly inside the winner. COOL HAND
COOP broke slowly, saved ground around the turn, angled to the far outside through the furlong grounds, and finished willingly to best the others.
SOVEREIGN WARRIOR raced three wide around the turn, and lacked a solid closing response. MOON PISTOL broke slowest, and improved mildly in the
lane while not a factor. CURTIN'S UP raced three to four wide around the turn, and tired in the stretch. HERO OF THE HOUR moved off the inside around
the turn, and could not reach contention. ONE FAST showed speed outside for three furlongs, and gave way. BRIDOLOGIST retired early.

Footnotes
BAHAMIAN GIRL set the pace two wide down the backstretch, cleared and angled in early on the turn, repulsed a bid from the runner-up in upper stretch
and drew clear under a drive. TREVESS had early speed inside of the winner, angled out nearing the three-eighths pole, re-bid two wide in upper stretch but
proved no match for the winner while holding well to preserve the place. ABARRIO FOREVER was forced out at the start, raced off the pace inside, made
good progress in upper stretch, angled out and switched back to the left lead near the sixteenth marker and flattened out. TALKTHETALK stumbled at the
start, advanced two wide around most of the turn, swung six wide approaching the quarter pole but was one-paced in the lane. SAY ADIOS chased the
pace inside, angled out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. CHIQUI THE GRAY chased the pace two wide and faded in the lane. TALE OF V K played no
factor while racing four wide. ITSENOUGH broke outwardly, chased the pace three wide between foes and came up empty in the lane. SHES ONE MAD
MOMMA trailed in the two path.

CHAO was allowed to settle early four then three wide, remained in the three-path rallying off the far turn, and finished determinedly to wear down the
leaders from outside. GHOSTLYPRINCE was bumped between horses at the start, prompted the pace inside, moved out two wide to the stretch, wrested
command outside UNDER THE COUVERS in deep stretch but was overhauled near the finish. DAISY'S DOC was five wide into the first turn, moved inward
thereafter to wind up near the two-path, and was along for the show late. UNDER THE COUVERS became edgy in the gate dislodging the rider briefly, set
the pace inside, and gave way through the last eighth of a mile. EL AFORTUNADO bumped with GHOSTLYPRINCE at the start, trailed early inside, moved
out widest for the drive and went by tired horses. EXPONENTIAL prompted the pace outside UNDER THE COUVERS, and gave way soon after going a
half-mile. WESTERLY WIND bumped with GHOSTLYPRINCE at the start, and posed no threat. LIAMS STAR steadied first time under the wire, steadied
and bobbled midway on the first turn, and dropped back.

Footnotes
BAJAN GIRL set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and widened under a mild drive. DREAM MARIE tracked the pace three wide in the
clear, could not match strides with the winner in the lane but was clearly second best. REMARKABLE SOUL broke outwardly, prompted the winner two wide
and weakened in the lane. ALIZEE failed to menace while racing two wide. BELLA CIAO hit the starting gate, raced off the pace four wide around the first
turn, two wide around the far turn and never threatened. HELPING LISA D angled out entering the first turn, raced in the three path around that bend,
angled in nearing the far turn and retreated inside.

Footnotes
A BEAUTIFUL DAY got clipped from behind by CHARLOTTE THE BRIT midway on the first turn, tracked two then three wide to the stretch, bid outside MS
BIG SPRING and TOWA past the eighth-pole and forged past under a drive. TOWA prompted the pace outside MS BIG SPRING, reached a short lead
coming to mid stretch, could not withstand the winner and held the place. LITTLE BIT GOOD saved ground early, had the two-path around the far turn, and
rallied outside to be along for the show. MS BIG SPRING set the pace inside, got overhauled in mid stretch, and gave way. CARIBBEAN KITTEN got forced
out behind the spill on the first turn, advanced approaching the stretch, and finished evenly. TOKYO was outrun early near the three-path, shifted out a bit
wider into the lane and gained mildly. PLAY THAT TONE saved ground in easy striking range to the head of the lane, and lacked the needed response.
HELEN HAYES gained mildly along the inside turning for home, but flattened out late. TAKE THE OVER was keyed up four wide going to the first turn,
moved in a couple paths and was empty after a half-mile. MILEY was forced out to avoid the spill midway on the first turn, and never got close. MISS MAC
was in tight entering the first turn, got forced out behind the spill just before completing the first quarter-mile, tired after a half, and was eased up late.
CHARLOTTE THE BRIT clipped the heels of A BEAUTIFUL DAY midway on the first turn, stumbled badly unseating the rider, ran along outside the leaders
to the top of the stretch before drifting well out in the course, and was escorted off after being apprehended. The half-mile fraction was hand-timed. THERE
WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE FIRST TURN BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.
