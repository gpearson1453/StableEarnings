Footnotes
BEARAKONTIE showed early speed alongside SNOW SCENE, moved five-wide into the first turn, led three-wide into the backstretch and began to draw
off, set the pace then held sway under a drive. SIX PACK GIRL settled in mid pack, chased hard three-wide on the far turn and finished under a determined
drive. MADAME BOVERY settled in mid pack, closed along the rail on the far turn, chased through the stretch but lost the place position nearing the wire.
NORTHERN ALLURE settled in mid pack, was hustled from two-wide and the rail on the far turn then finished gamely through the stretch. RING IN
SILENCE settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn then rallied mildly. EXQUISE settled off the pace, rode the rail throughout, was
hustled on the far turn then rallied belatedly. WIN LOSE OR STRAW settled off the pace, closed two-wide on the far turn but never reached contention.
TRICKERATION raced from off the pace, closed late backstretch and through the turn but evened out in the final 16th. SNOW SCENE had brief speed,
stalked the pace, dropped back late backstretch and through the far turn, was eased in the stretch and walked off.

and was ridden out late. MARAIS stalked the pacesetter, was hustled from the rail on the far turn and finished under a determined drive. CLASSY
MISTRESS settled off the pace, angled out with a furlong to run and closed gamely through the stretch. KATZ YOU LATER stalked the pace, was hustled
three-wide on the far turn then was game in the stretch but lacked a kick in the late stages. CALL HER JOEY, off slowly, raced in mid pack, came two and
three-wide on the far turn, closed into the stretch and finished gamely in vain. DELIGHTFUL DREAMER settled in mid pack, came three and four-wide on
the far turn but failed to menace. PENETANGUISHENE away slowly, forced the pace on the backstretch and through the far turn, chased into the stretch
but evened out in the final furlong. ELFIN FOREST broke with her head in the air and was steadied, trailed throughout and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
TACKLE THE NORTH raced from off the pace, closed four-wide on the turn, launched a determined drive and got up late, driving. WORDS OF GOLD
bumped with BOSCOBEL at the start, moved up to lead late backstretch, dashed clear into the turn, set the pace, was caught late and just held place. FLAT
OUT FABULOUS ducked out leaving and settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn, angled inwards through the stretch, was closing well but
was outkicked. DUE NORTH, away slowly and off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. WUK UP QUEEN, away
slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn then rallied late between foes. STORMY SUZIE, in range, was hustled two-wide and from
the rail on the turn, was game in the stretch but weakened late. ENHANCED FINANCE pressed the pace, raced along the rail and two-wide on the turn but
evened out in the final 16th. MINE FAST PHILLY stalked the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. BOSCOBEL
bumped with WORDS OF GOLD leaving the gate, settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. PIRANO
showed brief speed then settled in mid pack, chased from the rail and two-wide on the turn but failed to menace. LIGHT IT UP raced from off the pace, was
hustled two-wide on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
RECONFIGURE stalked hid stablemate while three wide throughout, loomed up turning for home and inched up down the lane, appearing to hang by the
sixteenth pole but determinedly got by in the shadow of the wire. LAPOCHKA off the pace early, came two to four wide to close the gap on the turn, was
fanned into the eight path turning for home, continued to eat into the leaders' advantage while laying in down the lane, coming with a bold rush in the final
forty yards to just miss. CORDUROY ROAD went right to the engine, held his advantage around the bend, shook off a challenger by mid stretch and
stubbornly held to the final stages, caught in the shadow of the wire. SILENT FLASH chase along the inside, came out between runners to bid turning for
home but was repelled by the leader, holding on for a minor award. WILE E PEYOTE off the pace early, rallied two to three wide on the turn and was in the
seven path inside the eventual place finisher turning for home, but while that one stayed wide, he was in behind a wall searching for a seam in upper
stretch, bulling his way between rivals inside the eighth pole and closed, but had too much to do after the traffic problem. PIVEN sat in mid pack, was three
wide between rivals on the turn and in behind a wall of runners in upper stretch but levelled off when room appeared in the final furlong. WHERE'S
ANTHONY was two wide in mid pack throughout, chasing inside the leaders in upper stretch but outrun in the final furlong. BRASS COMPASS was steadied
hard along the rail into the turn, regrouped to get up inside behind the leader late on the turn but had nothing left for the stretch drive. DANI'S VICTORY off
the pace and still trailing the field around the turn, only able to pass a few stragglers down the stretch. EXPLODE off the pace early, came three to five wide
into range on the turn and fanned out to the seven path turning for home, his rally stalling in the final furlong. SKY MAGICIAN had a four wide trip while
chasing in mid pack, loomed into range turning for home but retreated from midstretch to the wire.

NOT ORBINARY, in range, angled from the rail to three-wide on the far turn launched a powerful rally, led a furlong out, drove clear and was taken in hand
near the wire. LINE OF VISION raced in mid pack, raced three then two-wide on the far turn and finished under a determined drive. BELLA NINA was off
slowly then rated off the pace, closed outside rivals into the far turn, was hustled four and five-wide then rallied outside. STOP WHO'S THAT showed early
speed then forced the pace, stalked into the far turn, bid mid turn, led upper stretch but was passed a furlong out and chased to the end. CAPOEIRA, in
range early, came two-wide then from the rail on the far turn and was all out in the stretch. BIONDETTI'S CHOICE, in range, raced three-wide on the first
turn and was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn then finished under a mild rally. FLECK settled off the pace, trailed into the stretch but never
reached contention. POWER HOUSE broke alertly, dueled, shook clear on the first turn, set the pace, was joined midway through the final turn, was headed
upper stretch and gave way. MODUS OPERANDI broke in the air, settled in mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide late on the far turn but was never in
contention. LEON AZUL settled in mid pack, raced three-wide on the first turn and was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn but lacked a rally.

in vain. BEAR KITTY raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn then closed willingly through the stretch. GIMBALA stumbled leaving the gate
and settled off the pace, chased two to four-wide on the turn then rallied from the outside. BEAU'S BEAUTY stalked the pace, was hustled two and
three-wide on the turn then showed some interest in the stretch. BLONDE ATTITUDE bobbled leaving the gate and was taken off the pace, was hustled
from the rail and two-wide on the turn then rallied outside. ZYANZA broke outward, settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn but failed to
