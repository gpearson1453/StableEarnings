Footnotes
PRINCESA BLANCA contested the early pace on the inside, was eased back late on the first turn, settled off the pace on the backstretch, drafted behind
horses in the two path on the far turn, waited passing the quarter-pole, was roused while swinging six wide into the stretch, rallied outside to make a bid into
the final sixteenth, fought with the runner-up to the wire and prevailed under steady urging. QUEEN OF THE LANE broke out and hit the gate, went four
wide on the first turn, moved up to prompt the pace on the outside, took the lead under urging in the three path on the far turn, moved clear passing the
quarter-pole, remained clear under a drive into the final furlong, was challenged nearing the sixteenth-pole then lost the advantage to the winner, fought with
that foe to the wire and missed while well clear for the place. I GOT WINGS broke out at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, moved
out over heels leaving the backstretch, was hard ridden while five wide on the far turn and came up empty while best of the rest. LINDA GOT LUCKY went
three then two wide on the first turn, set the pace under a snug hold, was headed under urging while inside early on the far turn and stopped.
GOINGTOAGOGO was taken up briefly after the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch,
made a bid in the four path on the far turn, dropped back late on that bend and faltered.

Footnotes
JIMMY TWO TIMES was away alertly, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two then three path on the turn, took the lead near the three-eighths,
responded well under pressure into upper stretch, fought with two foes under a drive into the final furlong, shook off those rivals outside the sixteenth-pole
and drew away under steady urging. FOOLISH DREAMS was reserved off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch then
tipped out to the eighth path and got up for the place while no match for the winner. CREOLE CHARLIE raced just off the pace on the outside, chased in the
four path on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch, made a bid at the three-sixteenths, battled with two foes under a drive until inside the furlong marker
and also proved no match for the winner but lost the place. JANETS JAY JAY broke a step slow while drifting out, angled in at the rear of the field, moved
out near the half-mile pole, went five wide while roused on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, made a bid at the three-sixteenths, fought outside of
two foes until inside the furlong marker and weakened. GET THEM JUSTIN was restless in the gate, attempted to get outside early but was kept in by
CREOLE CHARLIE, was rated while getting kickback, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn, shifted four wide into the
stretch, angled out around the three-sixteenths, drifted out around the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. SCHNELL became fractious when a
neighbor acted up in the gate, broke in at the start then was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure, lost the advantage along the rail on the turn,
dropped back into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MONTPELIER went to the front, set the pace while inside to the two path, responded well when asked coming to the quarter-pole, drew off under a
left-handed whip into the final furlong, drifted out a bit shortly thereafter, was switched to a right-handed whip and given one crack around the sixteenth-pole
then was eased up late while much the best. GO BIG GREEN steadied while in tight between horses nearing the first turn, raced inside to the two path on
that bend, settled at the rear, was urged along while inside early on the far turn, shifted three wide at the five-sixteenths, was driven four wide into the
stretch, drifted out around the three-sixteenths and earned the place. CARSON'S PRINCESS went three to four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on
the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and tired. ITALIAN TWIN broke in at the start, swerved out six
wide into the first turn then dropped to the five path, settled at the back, was urged along while five wide early on the far turn then dropped to three wide and
failed to respond. MADAME READY went four wide on the first turn, settled near the middle of the field, dropped back under urging late o n the backstretch,
went four to five wide on the far turn and faltered. SWEET WORKOUT went around the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, saved
ground under urging on the far turn and retreated.

able to get the show. EMERALD FOREST bumped soundly with a foe at the start, chased the pace, went around the turn in the three path, floated five wide
into the stretch and tired. CITADEL bumped hard with a rival at the start, went four wide on the turn and gained some but failed to threaten. PRAIRIE was

Footnotes
WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG chased the pace from second, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, took the lead outside the furlong
marker then edged clear under steady urging. PURE VALOR was urged along towards the rear, went three wide on the turn and finished with good energy
for the place. FAREWELL TIME quickly sped clear, went around the turn in the two path, came under the whip while still on his inside lead in upper stretch,
was headed outside the furlong marker and weakened but held the show. CAEUS IN PASADENA moved in while urged along off the pace, raced two path
to the inside on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick. DISAPPROVAL broke in at the start, was urged along on the
outside, went six wide on the turn, was driven eight wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. RICHARD RONALD was urged along off the
pace, went three to four wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to rally. LUVMEWHENIMGONE was jostled in the hindquarters at the start,
raced on the outside while ridden along, dropped back late on the backstretch, went five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and tired.
FLASH DANCERLUCK was bumped at the start and forced into another foe, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. LENAPE DRIVE
stumbled at the start then brushed with a rival, settled off the pace, was roused while inside to the two path on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch
then moved further out and came up empty. MR MAKEITHAPPEN was urged along towards the front, went four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the
stretch and retreated. SMOOTH GALLOP was bumped at the start and forced into another rival then dropped back while in tight, saved ground at the rear of
the field and trailed.

Footnotes
D'WILD BARONESS was keen while rated just off the pace, ranged up in the two path on the turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, turned into the
stretch between horses, shook clear into the final furlong and drew away under steady urging. STAR'S DREAM raced well back in the field, went four wide
on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and finished willingly for the place. TUFFOLOGY was ridden along in the front half of the field, went three then two
wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick then just missed the place but was clear for the show. CUSTOM CUT
tracked the pace down the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, made a bid inside the five-sixteenths, held a narrow advantage into the stretch, battled
with the winner into the final furlong and weakened. ROMAN JEWELS was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and failed to respond.
MADISON'S PLACE was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and came up empty. EMERY'S DREAM
pressed the pace on the inside, dropped back passing the half-mile pole, chased inside on the turn and tired. CAJUN MUSIC was ridden along towards the
rear, went five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DREAMING OF CURLIN broke out then was hustled, set the pace
under pressure, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole and gave way. FLOATIE was urged along well back in the field, went four wide on
the turn, came eight wide into the lane and was no factor. IONA GUITAR settled well back in the field, went three wide on the turn, came six wide into
stretch and was pulled up then walked off.
