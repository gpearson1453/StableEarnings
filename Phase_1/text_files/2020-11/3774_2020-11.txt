Footnotes
ACCOLADES GALORE broke sharply setting the pace widening near mid track in upper stretch holding safe to wire. LEGENDARYS FIRST rallied on the
far turn bidding willingly six wide down the lane. DUDES PICK slow early gave a mild rally on the far turn then raced evenly down the lane to best the others.
FRIDAY gained on the backside chasing through the far turn weakening in upper stretch. MATTYICE hustled along pressed then chased through the far
turn wearing out in upper stretch. THREE ILLUSIONS sent up early stayed close through the backside then flattened out on the far turn. PEACE CONTROL
was always outrun.

Footnotes
GRAZED MY BISCUITS pressed a narrow lead through the turn then dealt with inside pressure in the closing yards holding on at the wire. PACK TWELVE
pressed the pace extending from the rail down the lane giving a final surge just missing. GIDEON'S SWORD chased the pace pressing on the turn,
extending near mid track down the lane would finish evenly. KITTEN'S WORLD broke slowly bobbling at the break. PITMAN VALLEY flashed early speed
then gave way on the turn. MAKINDREAMSCOMETRU was always outrun. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF PACK TWELVE AGAINST THE
RIDER OF GRAZED MY BISCUITS FOR INTERFERENCE DURING THE STRETCH RUN WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
