Footnotes
KHOZANDO settled off the pace along the inside, made some progress inside around the turn, angled three wide leaving the quarter pole, closed on the left
lead to seized command near the eighth pole, vied outside of THOROVER to the sixteenth marker, veered out while belatedly switching leads, straightened
out and powered clear under a drive. COBB was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled four wide nearing the lane, rallied outside and
gained the place in the final strides. THOROVER stalked the pacesetter in the clear three wide, took over leaving the quarter pole, vied inside of the winner
through much of the lane but weakened in the final sixteenth and lost second in the final strides. MASTER OF DISASTER lacked early speed, raced four
wide and passed tiring rivals. ROYAL MEETING was bumped at the start, raced well back two wide for a half, made good progress between rivals in upper
stretch but flattened out through the final furlong. UNCAPTURED SOLDIER was bumped a few strides out of the gate, chased the pace three wide and
faded around the turn. BLACK V. K. was bumped just after the start, raced four wide and never threatened. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT was bumped at the start,
sprinted clear soon after, set the pace in the two path to upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
PALADIO drafted behind a trio of embattled leaders around the turn, found a seam splitting horses in the three-path at the top of the stretch, dueled outside
LAUDA SPEED through the final furlong and prevailed all out. LAUDA SPEED pressed the pace between horses into the turn, poked a head in front after a
half-mile, battled inside PALADIO past the eighth-pole and stayed on stubbornly. FAMOUS GENT saved ground outsprinted leaving the backstretch,
gradually shifted out four wide after a half, had aim outside the leaders through the stretch, and was inching closer in the final yards. ZAMFIR pressed the
pace outside KING TARZAN and LAUDA SPEED to the head of the stretch, and weakened. KING TARZAN set the early pace hounded by two rivals, and
gave way inside through the lane. LAMPLIGHTER JACK came under vigorous urging up the backstretch, but had no response outside. GEGE CONQUEST
broke a step slow, trailed throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
LETS PLAY HARDBALL was in tight at the start, was keen to go behind rivals while racing two wide through the opening half, squeezed through a narrow
opening three wide nearing the far turn, bumped MIKE IS READY nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, seized command near the three-eighths pole, drew
clear in the two path around the far turn and widened under a drive. PRETENDANT had early speed inside, dropped back down the backstretch, angled
entering the far turn, raced three wide around the bend, came five wide into the lane and churned on to gain the place in the final strides. MIKE IS READY
steadied nearing the first turn, raced off the pace four wide around that bend and three wide around the far turn, lacked a rally and just missed second
between foes late. BAD BOY E. J. vied two wide around the first turn, angled in nearing the far turn, chased the winner around the bend and weakened in
the final furlong. HARPER GO LUCKY was always outrun inside. TIZ LUNA had early speed three wide, vied outside down the backstretch and retreated
around the far turn.

Footnotes
QUENANE grabbed the lead on the first turn in the three-path, moved inside fending off a challenge from RED CRESCENT past the half-mile pole and into
the far turn, shook that rival off after six furlongs, changed leads awkwardly in upper stretch, regrouped on the rail and held for the decision. NOBLE DRAMA
was ridden along after a half but made little headway two wide, shifted out to the four-path turning for home, got rolling belatedly and could not reach the
winner. DEBBIE'S PASSION led early but deferred and steadied back inside QUENANE midway on the first turn, moved out three wide staying in range to
the head of the stretch, and finished one-paced. GARTER AND TIE went two then three wide around the first turn, moved inside after that and posed no
threat. RED CRESCENT was four wide on the first turn, challenged outside QUENANE and briefly put a head in front midway on the far turn, then gave way
through the stretch.

Footnotes
SHEA D SUMMER set a pressured pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. BRIELLA pressed the winner two wide to upper stretch, was no match for
that foe in the lane but held well to be clearly second best. SKY PROPOSAL was reluctant to load, chased the pace inside down the backstretch, angled
three wide entering the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, lacked a rally but was along for the show. SPECIAL PRINCESS chased the pace two
wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and came up empty. ROYAL HABIBI failed to menace while racing two and three wide. SPEEDY FIRE trailed
inside.

Footnotes
LEGAL DEAL loomed menacingly just outside the embattled leaders approaching the quarter-pole, idled a bit turning for home, bumped with SHIVAREE
while outside that one in upper stretch, stayed on task and surged to nail JACKSON nearing the wire. JACKSON was allowed to settle inside, cut the corner
rallying into the stretch, reached the front through the furlong grounds and edged clear staying on his left lead, and was nailed at the finish. WITH VERVE
was a step slow at the start, trailed for a half-mile two then three wide, shifted out widest for the drive and was up late for the show. SHIVAREE pressed AS
SEEN ON TV from outside, battled head and head past the quarter-pole, bumped with LEGAL DEAL while beginning to weaken in upper stretch, and was
overhauled for third in the closing stages. AS SEEN ON TV set a sharp pace with SHIVAREE breathing down his neck for a half, then weakened between
horses getting overtaken from both sides a furlong out. VINNIE VAN GO raced three wide, and weakened approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
POPPY'S PRIDE set the pace in the two path, widened in upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging near the sixteenth pole then straightened out
under right-handed pressure and held firm. GATSBY lacked early speed, advanced two wide around the turn, angled in in upper stretch, bid inside of the
winner in midstretch but was held off. THE DISTRACTOR hit the gate, rushed up inside down the backstretch, steadied entering the turn, chased inside
around most of the bend, angled three wide near the quarter pole and was one-paced in the lane. REAL TALK chased the pace between rivals down the
backstretch, angled four wide early on the turn, chased outside around the bend and lacked a rally. ADVANCE CASH pressed the winner in the three path
for a half and faded through the lane. C. P. A. GENIUS saved ground to no avail. ONEMORETIMEAROUND steadily faded two wide. TIZ HANDSOME
stumbled badly at the start, lost the rider, galloped along behind the field and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START
AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR took control with an alert beginning, rated along two to three paths off the rail to the stretch, and remained in command under
pressure. SOUND MACHINE broke slowly, advanced to get closest to the pacesetter into the turn, was ridden along past the three-eighths, could not put a
dent in the margin and ran on clear of the others. CECI VALENTINA was outrun early, put in a run along the rail turning for home, but flattened out through
the furlong grounds. FOXY MISCHIEF was a step slow at the start, came under a ride on the turn three wide, and made no headway. HEIRESSALL was
forwardly placed early two wide, and gave way soon after going a half-mile.
