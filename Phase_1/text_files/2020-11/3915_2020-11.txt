HINDSIGHT stalked the pace three wide, chased the leaders four wide through upper stretch, but sustained a late surge after BE LIKE WATER ranged up
along side, forged an advantage at the sixteenth pole, and won going away. BE LIKE WATER rated off of the pace along the inside, tipped to the three path
into the turn before shifting five wide turning for home, then rallied outside of foes through the lane, and just reached place at the wire. SEMBLE JUSTE
(IRE) bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace two wide, dueled in upper stretch before forging an advantage approaching the furlong pole,
but was headed at the sixteenth pole by the eventual winner, and was nailed on the wire by a surging foe for place. BOW BOW GIRL saved ground while
trailing around the turn, hugged the fence and advanced in upper stretch, tipped two wide and brushed ANOUSH mildly at the furlong pole before shifting
back inwards to attempt a bid, but did not have enough. ANOUSH stalked along the inside, shifted three wide at the quarter pole, but only produced a
chasing grind before being brushed by an inner foe at the furlong pole, and tired between horses. MEJTHAAM tracked in the two path around the turn, but
failed to mount a rally. TAYET set the pace along the inside, dug in inside of a rival through upper stretch, but gave way at the furlong pole and weakened.
HAPPY SUCCESS tracked from midpack four wide around the turn, but weakened turning for home.

furlong pole, then surpassed the leader at the sixteenth pole. SECONDARY MARKET stalked two wide, vied around the turn, forged an advantage in upper
stretch before drawing clear at the furlong pole, but was bested by an inner surging rival passing the sixteenth pole. CASUAL saved ground off of the pace
into the turn, awaited racing room two wide turning for home, but remained blocked behind rivals through upper stretch, switched out at the furlong pole, and
rallied outside of foes to reach show. CHARMING LADY chased three wide and between horses into the turn, failed to keep pace with the leaders at the five
sixteenths pole, faded in upper stretch, but regained stride when put to driving pressure approaching the furlong pole, and passed foes for a minor share.
UNION MAIDEN broke outwardly while off a step slow, tracked from off of the pace three wide around the turn, shifted five wide turning for home, but only
managed a chasing charge, and got outfinished by an inner foe and an outer rival for a minor reward. LAKE AVENUE was off a beat slowly, advanced to a
four wide stalking position from midpack into the turn, shifted down a path turning for home, but failed to keep pace with inner foes in upper stretch, and
faded. ZANADU set the pace along the inside, dug in after being headed in upper stretch, but gave way passing the furlong pole, and weakened.
CHARETTE stalked along the inside early on, but steadily faded. BEACH GETAWAY rated off of the pace two wide, tipped four wide turning for home, but
failed to sustain a bid before weakening.

the leader. TOUGH LOVE vied for the lead four wide around the turn, but failed to keep pace with an inner foe in upper stretch, and chased through the lane

Footnotes
ENVOUTANTE set a moderate pace while in hand, quickly spurted away from bidding foes when let out a notch passing the quarter pole, and drew away
handily. BONNY SOUTH stalked along the inside, came into the lead in the two path, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, then
surpassed outer foes at the furlong pole, and proved second best. ANOTHER BROAD bumped with a foe at the start, saved ground far off of the pace
around the turns, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, then stayed on to reach show at the wire. OUR SUPER FREAK stalked two wide while shifting
from the four path to the two path around the first turn, inched closer into the far turn and vied between foes around that bend, but failed to keep pace with
her inner counterpart in upper stretch, faded, then was nailed on the wire for show. SMOOTH WITH A KICK tracked from midpack two wide and between
horses around the turns, shifted four wide at the quarter pole, but failed to produce a bid. OVER THINKING lied far off of the pace two wide around the turns
before shifting five wide in upper stretch, but failed to mount a rally. MARKET RUMOR stalked three wide while shifting from the five path to the four path
around the first turn, vied outside of a pair of foes around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with them in upper stretch, and weakened. CASH OUT got a
bit anxious right before the gates opened and was unprepared at the start, tracked from off of the pace three wide around the turns, got fanned five wide
turning for home, but weakened.

Footnotes
ANCIENT WARRIOR bumped a foe and got pinched back at the start, rallied three to four wide around the turn, swung six wide turning for home, then
sustained his charge outside of rivals to produce a late bid, and just got up at the wire. SENOR JOBIM lied forwardly placed four wide, made a confident bid
for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, vied while unable to kick clear from PIRATE RICK in upper stretch, forged an advantage while meeting bids from
rivals on both sides at the sixteenth pole, and got nailed on the wire by his outer foe. UBER KIRK settled off of the pace in the two path, advanced by saving
ground turning for home, sustained his rally inside of foes through upper stretch before shifting out and splitting foes at the sixteenth pole to make a bid
inside of a pair of rivals, but missed. LUNA'S IN CHARGE tracked from midpack three wide around the turn, shifted five wide turning for home, but only
produced a grinding rally and was outkicked by rallying foes at the furlong pole. COLTONATOR lied forwardly placed two wide, shifted four wide in upper
stretch, and stayed on among traffic while chasing the leaders. PIRATE RICK dueled for the lead two wide before clearing his inner foe into the turn, met a
trio of bids at the five sixteenth pole, dug in to hold an advantage through midstretch, but yeilded approaching the sixteenth pole. WARRIOR'S MAP trailed
the field three wide around the turn, and improved through the lane. FIRE MARSHALL BILL raced far off of the pace two wide around the turn, drifted out to
the seven path in upper stretch, and passed tired foes. WILD BEHAVIOR got a bit rank at the start, dueled for the lead along the inside before shifting
outside of his counterpart into the turn, vied two wide and between horses around the bend, but weakened turning for home. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK lied
forwardly placed three wide, bid for the lead between horses at the five sixteenths pole, but weakened approaching the furlong pole, and was eased
thereafter. MOTAGALLY tracked from midpack two wide, but weakened turning for home. GALLANT PLUNGER tracked from midpack along the inside, but
was done early.
