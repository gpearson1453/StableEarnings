Footnotes
HERE WEGO racing in the five path early, angled in and took the lead on the turn, shook loose and held a long lead with a furlong to run and while tirring
late, held on. MARCH SCREAMER also angled in on the far turn, fell back on the turn and then was coming back late. TU EXAGERES saved ground and
rallied too late. GRAN CAUSEWAY, very wide and just off the pace, made up ground. BEAU TRACE broke slowly then steadied soon after and failed to
menace. WEST FORK broke right hitting the side of the gate then bumped BEAU TRACE, dueled for command in the four path, tired and finished in a dead
heat with TALLY HO. TALLY MO stalked two wide and tired, finishing on even terms with WEST FORK. QUALITY SPECIAL was never a factor.

Footnotes
AZLYNN'S DREAMER was never far back between foes then was left with rail, was blocked behind a wall of horses leaving the quarter pole, found an
opening between rivals, took the lead near mid stretch and held on. FRISKY FEELING broke very wide, raced and rallied extremely wide and just missed.
YOURINDENIAL split rivals rallying on turn and through stretch but was too late. RELEASE ME, lapped on winner early, continued wide and flattened out.
SYMPHONY OF LOVE, between rivals dueling for the lead, faded late. LEFTATTHEALTAR, wide throughout, was not a serious threat. SCAMPER ALONG
broke slowly then raced wide. HARDY JOJO never threatened passing faders. BIG RED OAK broke slowly and showed little. RAT A TAT TAT stumbled
leaving the gate, recovered and was sent up to duel inside then tired. ROSIE SUMMER saved ground and never threatened. WONDER CHARM, three wide
in top flight, stopped.

pace, closed but fell short. METHODICAL, wide and outrun early, found best stride too late. AUDACIOUS QUALITY was never a threat passing faders.
HIBACHI broke slowly, was hustled up inside, eased out on the far turn then tired. ASPEN XTREME saved ground and dropped back. MT SURIBACHI was
very wide and just off the pace then had nothing left.

Footnotes
PORTAL CREEK was very wide rounding the first turn, moved in on the backstretch, drifted slightly entering stretch, resisted and gamely held on.
FLASHNDYNAMITE was lapped on winner throughout and battled tenaciously to the wire. ANKLE MONITOR raced between foes and had no rally. B B'S
BUSTED steadied along entering backstretch then failed to threaten. NTH DEGREE saved ground early, swung out and never challenged. ITS A JOURNEY
raced wide and showed little. MONACO PRINCESS was never a factor.

Footnotes
ISABELLA SMILE was outrun early, advanced on the turn, came two wide into the lane, angled out, rallied outside past midstretch, surged in deep stretch
and was up in time. MAP OF AMERICA set the pace racing with a clear lead, widened the margin, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and was caught at the
wire. MABEL ISLAND tracked close up on the inside, chased on the turn, raced evenly in the stretch and earned the show spot. CHUBOFFTHEOLDBLOCK
chased inside, came three wide into the lane and lacked a winning bid. ARIMA raced off the pace inside and closed belatedly inside in the stretch.
PRECIOUS stalked outside rivals, raced four wide on the turn and had no rally. SNOW FORECAST chased three wide, came four wide into the lane and
tired. BUCKS SOME raced close up early, then chased between rivals and gave way. GLAMOROUS THUNDER did not factor.

Footnotes
UP JUST IN TIME set the pace in the three path, shook clear leaving the turn and won under pressure. FREE COFFEE was bumped around leaving the
gate then was steered out to the eight path, gradually moved in, split foes rallying and finished well. SOUL PLANET came out at the start bumping FREE
COFFEE, raced just off rail and just off the pace then tired. PANTALONI, in the four path, angled out leaving the turn and had no kick. LI'LBITO'CHARM
raced very wide and was too late. IZA ONE saved ground, swung out in upper stretch and was no factor. NANCY B raced outside winner early then tired.
LIVELY KITTEN came in leaving the gate bumping foe then had brief speed. YELLOW CHICK, racing between rivals, wasn't a threat. WHITNEY COVE
showed nothing. CONGAREE ROSE vied for the early lead four wide then stopped.
