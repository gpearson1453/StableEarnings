Footnotes
GET NONE stalked outside of the pacesetter, dueled outside her from the three eighths past the furlong mark, and drive clear. FORT MARSH came inward
on TAYLOR'S BEAUTY in the opening strides, briefly disputed the pace inside of LEIGHTON KENTUCKY before settling back to track the leading pair,
raced keenly in the pocket on the turn, angled out into the lane, kept on with good interest but proved second best. HEY HEY was bumped by TAYLOR'S
BEAUTY in the opening strides after FORT MARSH bumped that one, took back toward the rear, advanced to midfield to chase inside of MY DARLING
SOFIA on the turn, was taken four wide midstretch, and kept on. LEIGHTON KENTUCKY sent for speed, set a pressured pace, dueled inside of GET NONE
from the three eighths to just past the furlong mark, and flattened out. TAYLOR'S BEAUTY was in tight between horses in the opening strides, chased
midpack inside of KIANA'S LOVE early, came into the lane between horses, and chased on evenly. TINDERELLA settled at the inside of the rear pair,
saved ground through the turn and into the lane, and rallied mildly inside. NOCTURNAL MISSION tracked the leading pair while positioned three wide, and
weakened in the lane. KENAI COOL chased toward the rear inside of horses, continued near the rear two wide in the lane, and was outfinished. MY
DARLING SOFIA settled three wide near the rear early, was urged two wide on the turn, was driven three wide into the lane but did not find the needed kick.
PALETTE settled near the rear, raced three to four wide on the turn, and proved no threat in the lane. KIANA'S LOVE chased three wide, was driven six
wide into the lane, and flattened out. ORDAINED KISS settled two wide in the rear pair, swung four wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
JETS A GINNIN quickly cleared, saved ground while well rated on the lead through the turn, was hand ridden through midstretch and driven in the final
furlong, and was never threatened. SHOWIT settled in second last, began to improve between horses through the turn, turned for home still between
horses, sustained her rally inside of SUPERSTAR DIVA in the lane, and got up for the place. SUPERSTAR DIVA tracked the pace inside of FOOT RUB
LOVE down the backstretch and in the two to three path on the turn, edged closer to JETS A GINNIN past the five sixteenths, was no match for her into the
lane, chased on but was outfinished for the place. FOOT RUB LOVE tracked the leader outside of SUPERSTAR DIVA, was urged in the three to four path
on the turn, flattened out from the five sixteenths, but was able to save a minor award. R U FORREAL settled at the rear, raced three wide into the bend,
continued in the four path in the rear flight on the turn, and passed tired horses under a drive in the lane. CHAMPAGNERIE chased toward the rear while
saving ground, and offered no rally in the lane. IMA LITTLE KITTEN chased three wide early, settled back to chase at the middle of a stretched-out pack in
the four path on the turn, and came up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
HONEST TO GOODNESS, reserved last to the far turn, swung out six wide racing into upper stretch gaining late momentum and wrested a clear advantage
in the closing stages under pressure. STOCK TRADE tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the far turn, shifted out four wide advancing on
the leaders nearing upper stretch, struck the front between calls late but couldn't fend off the winner. DERBY CHAMPAGNE angled to the inside tracking
just off the first flight racing to the far turn, shifted off the inside entering the stretch to split rivals three deep in the closing stages but was outkicked by the
top pair. BIG MONEY MACHINE tracked the leaders outside rivals as part of the second flight for a half, steadily gained terms with the first flight three deep
on the far turn, moved to challenge for command between foes in that path entering the lane but lacked the needed final kick. ANTARCTIC tracked off the
first flight between foes to the far turn, shifted out racing through the lane and continued evenly late. RIVER EVANGELIST settled outside a rival droping
well off the leaders, angled five wide racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. DOMIKATE settled near the inside racing to the backstretch,
shifted out racing into upper stretch but had no late response. A P IS LOOSE tracked off the second flight along the rail in the opening half, saved ground to
upper stretch, then altered course when lacking a path in the closing stages to race three deep between foes but made no real impact. HALF OF
MANHATTAN, urged to terms with a rival on the lead prompting the pace between foes racing to the backstretch, dueled for command along the inside
racing to upper stretch and gave out. SKYCRAFT settled into stride off the inside, shifted out racing wide to the lane but proved no threat. CONTRACTION,
urged to dispute the pace inside foes from the outset to the backstretch, gave way early. TUFF ATTACK, urged three deep prompting the pace into the
backstretch, pressed the issue between foes on the far turn and gave way midstretch.

Footnotes
SHE'S HONORABLE set a pressured pace, cleared from the quarter pole, and increased her advantage while kept to the task. TALLY UP pressed outside
of SHE'S HONORABLE, could not keep pace from the quarter, but kept on willingly under a drive. LAURA ATTACK raced at the inside of the tracking flight,
took the turn in the two path, was driven into the lane, proved no match for the leading pair, but kept on best of the rest despite ducking out late. DRIVE
LINE settled near the rear inside early, switched out to the four path near the three eighths, rallied mildly through horses in upper stretch, and evened out in
the final furlong. APRIL'S GEM was grazed by NURSE KATIE in the opening strides, raced four wide in the tracking flight, was driven four wide into the
lane, and flattened. LOCASH settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn, and improved mildly past tiring horses in the lane. APPLE VALLEY raced three
wide in the tracking flight early, continued between horses past the three eighths after DANCING DIAMOND started to fade, and weakened from the five
sixteenths. NURSE KATIE broke out and grazed APRIL'S GEM in the opening strides, settled between horses near the rear early, continued between
horses toward the rear on the turn, and offered no rally. DANCING DIAMOND raced between horses in the tracking flight early, began to lose ground from
the three eighths, had no response when driven, and continued to fade in the lane. AMERICAN COUNTESS settled three wide toward the rear, floated five
wide into the lane, and mustered no bid. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

IWILLPERSEVERE broke readily to prompt the pace along the rail racing into the backstretch, was eased off the pacesetter conceding the lead after a half,
switched outside that rival while continuing with a steady effort and moved to regain the advantage racing through the stretch, edging forward under firm
handling. MARKET ANALYSIS, urged forcing a rival's pace from the outset to the backstretch, edged forward while angling to the inside racing into the far
turn, resisted the winner's bid to midstretch but proved no match late. CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT settled along the rail in early stages, advanced to contention
inside foes after a half, shifted out bumping TARRACOTTA SOLDIER forcing that rival into the path of JUSY'S WAY nearing the three furlong marker,
continued in pursuit of the top pair three deep into the lane but finished evenly late. HIGH SPIRITS tracked off the first flight racing to the backstretch,
dropped out last after a half, angled to the inside racing into the far turn to gain some position but had no closing response. TERRACOTTA SOLDIER, off
slowly, then caught in tight quarters at the start, gained position between rivals after a half, was bumped while being forced into the path of JUDY'S WAY
racing into the far turn and quickly came up empty. JUDY'S WAY bobbled at the break while ducking inwards, was righted to track outside foes in the last
flight, was held up momentarily while being carried out nearing the three furlong marker and quickly came up empty.

Footnotes
GREAT SCAT, forwardly placed in the three path tracking just off the pacesetter, advanced in that path to challenge racing into upper stretch and went clear
late under firm encouragement. IOWA NATIVE, urged to the lead after breaking sharply, angled in setting the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the
rail into the turn, set the pace to upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner late. FOUR LEFT FEET settled inside foes racing to the turn, shifted out six
wide racing through the stretch and found his best stride late. R H SMOAKEM settled outside foes in the last flight early, angled inwards entering the turn
and continued with interest to improve position between foes in the closing stages. STRIKING HEIR, urged to a forward placing along the inside, tracked
just off the leaders along the rail racing through the turn but faded in late stages. OFFLEE FUN settled between foes early, angled inside rivals racing into
the turn but had no late bid. COUNTRY COOL broke awkwardly, was settled well off the field and failed to menace. SIRCORRI tracked just off the first flight
in the four path early but soon faded racing into the turn. OUTRUN THE POSSE, caught five wide between foes racing through the backstretch, retreated
into the turn. SHO POKE, caught six wide in early stages, soon retreated nearing the turn, shifted to the inside while dropping out late and was wrapped up
through the stretch.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI POINT sprinted to the lead soon after the break while angling inwards, dictated terms on a narrow margin racing into the bend, widened the
advantage through upper stretch and was kept to pressure. STORMY PACIFIC, caught in tight quarters, then shuffled at the start, settled near the inside
racing to the turn, angled seven wide in upper stretch and found a solid late response to prevail for the place honors. EASTER MUSIC, caught in close
quarters just after the start, was held up between foes, then switched out four wide racing into the turn while being prompted to advance, was fanned five
wide racing into the lane and was just outkicked for second. HELLOFAGUY tracked off the first flight between foes in early stages, was held up conceding
some position entering the bend, swung out six wide in upper stretch and continued with interest while outkicked for a share. MINISTER'S GLORY, off
slowly, was settled outside foes racing in the last flight into the bend, then split foes four wide in the closing stages to gain some position with a belated
effort. BIG SPORT, urged along three wide between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, gave way nearing midstretch. RUN AWAY BETT settled
inside foes in early stages, saved ground to the lane and finished evenly. MUTAKDDIM ROAD tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the turn
and faded after a half. LONG STATION settled off the second flight along the inside and soon faded. UNCLE NEARIS proved no factor. MONGOL BULL
angled in tracking off the first flight racing to the turn and was through after a half. GREAT GRET, urged along pursuing the pacesetter four deep through the
backstretch into the turn, gave out after a half.

Footnotes
RIVER CACTUS settled midpack, inched closer to the leading trio down the backstretch, improved position further while saving ground through the far turn,
got through to the lead into the lane, took over under a drive, and held sway. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE steadied into the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading
pair through the first turn, advanced into the backstretch to track the leader outside of RUFFOLO, tracked three wide through the far turn, launched a bid on
the leader approaching the turn for home, came three wide into the lane, chased RIVER CACTUS down the lane but could not reel him in. FULL OF RUN
settled in second last early, continued two wide in the rear flight for the backstretch run, raced in the four path in the rear flight on the far turn, swung seven
wide under a drive into the lane and was pushed further out by ANDREW THE GIANT, finished full of run but could not get to the leading pair in time.
EXEMPLAR was hung three wide midpack through the first turn, settled to chase in sixth well behind the leading five down the backstretch, took closer order
while driven in the three to four path on the far turn, brushed with RUFFOLO in upper stretch, and kept on four wide. ANDREW THE GIANT chased
between horses on the far turn, continued unhurried down the backstretch, raced toward the rear in the three path on the turn, swung six wide into upper
stretch, pushed FULL OF RUN out while drifting in upper stretch, sustained a rally but was outfinished. OFF THE MEDS was in tight in the opening strides,
chased midpack through the clubhouse turn and two wide on the backstretch, inched closer to the leading trio in tandem with RIVER CACTUS approaching
the far turn, chased the leading trio under a drive in the two path on the far turn, bid inside while still under a drive in upper stretch, and flattened in the final
furlong. RUFFOLO tracked the leader, was urged into the far turn, continued to track the pace between horses, flattened out gradually from the three
eighths, brushed with EXEMPLAR in upper stretch, and was no further threat in the lane. HAMAZING VISION broke slowly, settled at the rear, continued at
the inside of the rear flight down the backstretch and in the three path on the far turn, and offered no rally in the lane. SHWEET PERSUASION set the pace,
continued on the lead in the two path on the turn, was headed at the quarter pole, and weakened between horses.

Footnotes
COLOMBARD, forwardly placed between tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, pressed the issue racing into the turn gaining a narrow
advantage, edged clear racing into upper stretch and held HEISFANCY to the end under pressure. The latter tracked off the second flight outside foes
racing to the turn, swung five wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap. MAXIMUS IMAGE, off awkwardly, then held up avoiding tight
quarters early, angled to the inside steadily gaining position inside foes, came around a tiring foe nearing upper stretch, then shifted back to the rail while
steadily gaining position to the end. IMBETTINONBRUTUS tracked off the first flight along the inside, shifted out to split foes just off the inside nearing upper
stretch but lacked the needed late kick. CONSPICUOUS BOX tracked off the second flight along the inside in early stages, shifted out racing into the turn
and continued evenly between foes. CREAL WONDER, urged to a forward placing three wide prompting the pace into the turn, gave way into upper stretch.
BUMPTYBUMPBUMP tracked off the first flight five wide early, was prompted to make brief progress four wide on the turn but soon flattened out. ROLL
CALL settled between foes and failed to menace. DANCIN NICKY was urged disputing the pace inside foes in the opening stages but gave way early. RED
DIRT ROAD proved no threat.
