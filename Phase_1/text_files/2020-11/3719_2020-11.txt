Footnotes
MARCO ISLAND took quick control to rate the pace inside, came under pressure into the turn and dug in under a steady drive to hold on well. GIRLS LOVE
ME bobbled leaving the gate but recovered stride to stalk through the backstretch, gave chase into the turn then dueled through the stretch for second.
TOUGHEST 'OMBRE stalked the earlier pace three wide and gave chase four wide through the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
CERULEAN SPRINGS settled just off the pace inside and raced close nearest the rail on the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. SARATOGA
BOB broke a bit awkwardly and settled off the pace outside, came through the turn about the four path and showed little in the lane.

Footnotes
WONDER IN contested the early lead then angled to the inside to rate the pace, rounded the turn at the rail and was steadily handled to prove much the
best. BAZOO saved ground off the pace then bid into the turn, proved no match through the stretch and had to settle for second. THATWOULDBEGRAND
raced well off the early pace inside, started a bid into the turn then eased outward in the upper stretch and finished evenly to take third. GREAT GO GO
broke awkwardly then stalked the early pace off the rail, picked up the chase into the turn but weakened the final furlong. CANDYGRAMFORMONGO
settled off the earlier pace in the four and five paths then showed little response leaving the turn. DRAGON MOON raced off the pace about the three path
through most of the backstretch, angled six wide on the turn and showed little more. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD stalked the pace from the three path, started
a bid into the turn then gave way.

JUROR NUMBER FOUR settled off the early pace off the rail and was briefly hemmed in, closed to contention between horses and started a four wide bid
into the turn, dueled to the lead inside the three sixteenths pole and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. BUCKEY'S CHARM stalked the pace
inside and bid at the rail into the turn, angled out in the upper stretch and dug in to finish strong while gaining on the winner. LIV AND LET LIV rated close
toward the outside down the backstretch, challenged into the turn and dueled at a close disadvantage two deep through the turn, took a brief slim lead in the
upper stretch but was soon caught and flattened stride. UNREQUITED LOVE rated a short early lead just off the rail, came under pressure into the turn and
contested the edge nearest the rail through the turn but was caught in the upper stretch and weakened. TUFF BUT FAIR rated close to the early pace
outside, gave chase from the five path into the turn but showed little in the lane. INFINITE REWARD raced off the pace through the backstretch then faded
into the turn.

Footnotes
GOTTAFLATHAVEHER took a quick lead to rate the pace inside then dug in from the head of the lane to hold on well with steady handling. PETES PRIDE
stalked the pace inside then rounded the turn off the rail, bid into the lane and eased to the three path, and while unable to gain on the winner, held on for
second. POLISHED COPPER settled off the pace through the backstretch and rounded the turn six wide, dug in widest leaving the turn and finished well
while gaining on the runner-up. PARCHED GHOST raced off the pace outside, bid into the turn and raced five wide through the turn, then ran evenly to late
stretch before flattening stride. ARBUTUS raced well off the pace toward the inside, rounded the turn at the rail then flattened stride. SILVER SIDES saved
ground off the pace, started a bid into the turn but weakened near the rail through the lane. DEIRDRE OF LEGEND chased the early pace inside, rounded
the turn in the three and four paths then weakened.

Footnotes
LITTLE BAY raced off the pace toward the outside, raced six wide on the turn and dug in to take over the final yards. SILVER CONNECTION stalked the
earlier pace about the three path, bid into the turn and raced off the rail through the turn, drifted a bit into the lane and took the lead past the eighth pole,
then reluctantly ceded later yards. TRUE SHIPMAN raced well off the early pace then bid into the turn, angled four wide entering the stretch and finished
well to take third the final yards. BOSS LIFE settled off the early pace while racing off the rail, dug in leaving the turn to take aim inside the eighth pole but
flattened stride later yards. GOOD LUCK LEGACY saved ground racing well back, bid at the rail into the turn and ran evenly to mid-stretch before flattening
stride. NOT TELLING chased the early pace off the rail, faded through the turn and was carried to the six path into the lane, then weakened. TEMPTING
MOMENT raced well back from early contention, rounded the turn off the rail and finished evenly. PERSEVERED was pinched back at the start and
dropped well off the pace, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened. COMPASS COURSE raced well off the pace, rounded the turn in the six and
seven paths, angled out into the lane and showed little further. FAVOR MAKER broke inward and raced off the pace, rounded the turn five and seven wide
then weakened. MORE THUNDER was hustled clear to set the pace, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn, was caught mid-stretch and
gave way. RICKY RICKY was pinched back early and never factored.

MCELMORE AVENUE stalked outside most of the backstretch, raced close about the four path of the turn, dueled to the front mid-stretch and widened the
final sixteenth. SILENT MALICE settled off the pace and off the rail, bid leaving the half mile pole and raced in the three path of the turn, angled out in the
upper stretch and dug in to take second inside the eighth pole. DAPER'S DRINK contested the early pace between horses and rated clear on the turn, but
was caught mid-stretch and flattened stride the final sixteenth. GLORIOUS WEEKEND settled off the pace through the backstretch, bid into the turn and
raced off the rail through the turn, then finished evenly toward the inside. CLASSY SOLUTION stalked the pace toward the inside, bid at the rail approaching
the turn, raced at the rail through the turn then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. WIND RIDGE stalked the earlier pace then gave chase from the four
and five paths on the turn, but showed little more. BAD SUENO was sluggish getting into stride and raced well back from early contention, started a bid
approaching the turn and raced at the rail through the turn, though, showed little further. WAR LANCE raced off the pace outside, rounded the turn about the

Footnotes
FILLE D'ESPRIT rated close inside through the backstretch, angled three wide with a bid into the lane and took the lead mid-stretch, then drew away the
final sixteenth. ODD GAL took a slim lead soon after the start and rated the pace, contested the edge two deep on the turn, but was caught mid-stretch and
had to settle for second. COMBAT QUEEN contested the early pace inside, raced close at the rail rounding the turn and continued on gamely to mid-stretch
before beginning to weaken. KISS THE GIRL rated off the pace, bid in the three path of the turn and finished evenly. HAD THE NOTION chased the pace
toward the outside, raced in the four path of the turn, drifted into the lane and had little left. GRAND SKYLARK contested the pace early but steadied
approaching the turn, stalked through the turn but drifted to the five path into the lane and weakened. VICTORY TIME saved ground well off the pace, eased
outward into the lane and had no bid.

Footnotes
JOLLY SWAGMAN raced just off the early pace then angled five and six wide on the turn and bid into the lane, dueled to the front mid-stretch and edged
clear under steady handling. RATIFY stalked the earlier pace inside, bid at the rail into the turn, dug in for the lead toward the head of the lane but was
caught mid-stretch, altered course a sixteenth out and finished well. GALILEAN MOON settled off the pace then started a six wide bid into the turn, left the
turn about the seven path and finished well. SUPER HOUDINI settled off the pace through the backstretch, bid into the turn then angled to the seven path
approaching the head of the lane and finished evenly outside. FIRECALL took a short lead soon after the start and rated the pace, came under pressure into
the turn, but was caught in the upper stretch and flattened out inside the eighth pole. ISLE OF MAN settled off the pace saving ground, bid at the rail leaving
the turn then flattened out inside the eighth pole. STROLLED ON BY raced off the pace through the backstretch, bid off the rail into the turn then flattened
stride mid-stretch. MORE TWIRL stalked the pace through the backstretch, bid into the turn then faded through the turn. ALIFEROUS stumbled at the break
and dropped well back then rounded the turn eight and nine wide. CRYING FOR MORE stalked the pace outside, held aim four wide on the turn but
weakened into the stretch.
