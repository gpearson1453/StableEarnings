STATESBORO chased the pace from between horses two wide for five furlongs, angled outside entering the far turn, surged to the front rapidly drawing
clear then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best near mid track. WINCREDIBLE STAR unhurried early, rallied determinedly in the five path
into the stretch and finished second best. OAKS HONEY slow early, found his best stride late. EVEN KEELED trailed early, improved along the rail into the
stretch then leveled off. FIRSTHAND JUSTICE with the second flight three wide, swung wide and lost ground. CONDUCIVE failed to menace. ON FIRE
broke in front, set the pace off the rail into the far turn, drifted out to the middle of the racetrack and tired. TEAM HUCKY was no factor. DANEFIELD was
through after a half.

Footnotes
BLACK BUTTE broke well to set the pace off the rail in the five path and widened at will through the final furlong under a hand ride to win as much the best.
FLAWLESS FACE never far back, rallied through the stretch in the four path and finished clear for second. MONBA NUMBER FIVE unhurried early, swung
wide and passed tiring rivals in the middle of the racetrack. ANNISQUAM pressured the winner to that one's inside into the stretch then faded. JILLY FROM
JERSEY failed to menace. REGAL GHOST had speed into the turn then faded. DEVILISH MAGIC stalked the pace from the inside into the stretch then
flattened out. SHE'S NOT BLUFFING had speed into the turn then gave way. I GOT THE TIME was no factor. DOYLE THE WARRIOR was outrun.

MISTER MOBIL away alertly, set all the pace under pressured, drifted to the middle of the racetrack entering the stretch, drifted out again while under right
handed urging through upper stretch and drew away late under confident handling. SWEETNESSNCHARM pressured the winner two wide, was herded out
past the middle of the racetrack entering the stretch, matched strides with the winner until deep stretch while also drifting out and finished well clear for
second. C K'S LUCKY DUCK stalked the pace from the six path into the stretch, angled into the three path and went evenly. CITY VOLUME well placed,
failed to respond. OCCUR had good early speed then faded. SKYTOWN CAT was no factor. INSPIRED TO ROCK was no threat. MUSTANG WILLIE was
outrun. PRECIOUS JULES trailed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF SWEETNESSNCHARM LODGED A CLAIM OF
FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS TOOK

DOUGIE D ORO had speed from the start pressing the pace from the inside, shifted outside the leader nearing the turn, rallied to make the lead two wide
nearing the quarter pole then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best while taken in hand late. HONOR THE D unhurried early, closed
determinedly in the seven path through the stretch and finished second best. DOUGS MORNING PICK allowed to settle, finished with good courage in the
six path. WAPAKONETA PHIL made the lead soo, after the start, set the pace in the five path for a half then weakened in the stretch. WHO DAT MO failed
to menace. FU ROO was no factor. RIGGED UP stalked the early pace and was through after half. IT'S YOUR CALL was outrun. INTO THE OUT was
through early.

Footnotes
COLLUDE sprinted up the inside to make the lead before a quarter, set a pressured pace into the stretch, shook clear before the furlong marker and just
lasted under strong handling. MISS LEGS stalked the pace into the stretch, dug in determinedly in the four path through the final furlong and just missed
getting up in time. WARRIOR BABY unhurried early, was steadily gaining ground late in the six path. LIL H allowed to settle, dropped back on the turn,
drifted out through the stretch and lost ground. EMPIRITA failed to menace. IRISH THUNDER passed tiring rivals. PRETTYFUNNYHONEY was no factor.
LA MUNECA had the early advantage leaving the chute in the five path, prompted the pace into the turn then gave way. SEEKING VIOLET wide early,
flattened out. LUCKY TO HAVE ME was outrun. MOR BREEZE had speed into the stretch then stopped.
