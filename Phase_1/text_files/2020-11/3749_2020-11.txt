Footnotes
BEACH BAR grazed the gate, tracked the clear leader, closed up her advantage two wide on the far turn, led past the five sixteenths, was driven between
horses in upper stretch, and held sway. AUNT DOROTHY chased the leading trio, edged closer two wide down the backstretch, bid three wide approaching
the far turn, continued three wide around the bend, loomed into the lane, kept on under a drive but could not get to the winner. LOVERS QUARREL settled
midfield, took closer order four wide on the far turn, dropped to the inside for the stretch run, was in close range to midstretch, and was no match in the final
furlong. TANGO CITY settled toward the rear of midpack, improved position inside while keen on the backstretch, continued to take closer order two wide on
the far turn, floated four wide into upper stretch, and chased on while proving no match for the top three. BETTER ANGELS settled midpack, was urged
between horses on the far turn, swung six wide into the lane, forced LADY MECHANIC out when drifting further out in upper stretch, and lacked the needed
kick. FLAMING was away half a step slowly and veered out in the opening strides, settled near the rear, took closer order two wide approaching the far turn,
saved ground through the far turn, and lacked the needed kick in the lane. LADY MECHANIC was away awkwardly, settled at the rear, raced two wide in the
rear flight down the backstretch, improved three wide on the far turn, was swung out seven wide and driven into the lane, got pushed further out as BETTER
ANGELS drifted out, and never threatened. BIRD KEY settled in second last, continued at the inside of the rear flight down the backstretch, trailed in the
three path on the far turn, and did not rally. BARBIELLO tracked the leading pair inside and weakened through the far turn. MIDNIGHT FROST was placed
on the lead, cleared through the first turn, set the pace keenly on the backstretch, continued to lead in the two path on the far turn, was headed past the five
sixteenths and folded.

Footnotes
TAK stalked just off the first flight while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, tipped out in upper stretch to split foes and just edged BIG MAN BOB
nearing the wire under firm handling. The latter broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the rail, dueled for command racing into the far
turn, kicked clear racing into upper stretch and just missed. OVERPRAISE, reserved between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the
rail racing into the far turn, saved ground gaining position inside foes racing into upper stretch, then switched out in the closing stages while finishing with
interest to close the gap on the top pair. ALWAYS COOL tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing
into the lane and continued with a mild bid. THE GREEN MO'STER, caught four wide into the first turn racing as part of the last flight, settled off the leaders
to the far turn, angled five wide entering the lane and finished evenly late. GALINDO tracked off the second flight along the inside to the second bend,
shifted out to lodge a brief bid between foes entering the lane but soon flattened out. RICHIE GARY, off slowly, was settled last, made some belated
progress while angling six wide nearing midstretch but made no impression while finishing in hand late. GOOD INTENT, reserved off the last flight early,
failed to menace. HIGH HEATER tracked just off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch while being
prompted to advance but had no closing bid. DRIVER DAN, urged prompting a rival's pace, gave way abruptly racing into upper stretch.

AND HE'S LOOSE led under a snug hold while taking token pressure early, inched clear into the turn, set the pace in the two path on the bend, cleared
further when shaken up in upper stretch, felt the crop once midstretch and was hand ridden the rest of the way. END ZONE broke out and bumped STOSH
in the opening strides, attended the pace between horses early, tracked the leader in the three path on the turn, was no match as he opened up in upper
stretch, but chased on under a drive to prove a clear second best. NOT NOW RAND chased midpack, saved ground through the turn, improved position
under a drive inside in upper stretch, and chased on best of the rest. ALEUTIAN HARBOUR broke out and bumped PRUDENT HERO soundly in the
opening strides, settled at the inside of the rear flight, raced in the two to three path on the turn while still inside of PRUDENT HERO, and passed tiring foes
while drifting out in the lane. STOSH was bumped by END ZONE in the opening strides, attended the pace three wide between horses early, tracked in the
four path on the turn, and weakened from the quarter. PRUDENT HERO was bumped soundly by ALEUTIAN HARBOUR in the opening strides, raced
outside that foe in the rear flight down the backstretch and in the three to four path on the turn, and offered no rally. BEE ATTACK grazed the gate while
breaking out, attended the early pace four wide, weakened in the five path on the turn and trailed home.

Footnotes
RUSSIAN MAFIA was settled last near the inside racing to the backstretch, angled outside foes racing into the far turn to advance three deep, swung out
four wide racing into upper stretch to challenge for command in tandem with OH SO TERRIBLE midstretch and just edged that foe under firm hand urging
while her rider flashed a right handed whip. The latter was rated off the second flight while angling inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper
stretch to bid three deep between foes nearing midstretch, grudgingly resisted the winner but came up second best. BEACH FLOWER tracked off the
second flight outside a rival in the opening half, angled to the inside racing into the far turn, gradually gained contention racing into the lane, then shifted four
deep in the closing stages while prevailing for a share. AGI'S CAIT, washy in the post parade, pulled her way to the lead along the inside despite firm
restraint, dueled for command nearing the far turn into upper stretch and emptied out leaving the furlong marker. SHE'S DIVINE, bumped at the start,
quickly recovered to track just off the pacesetter near the inside, switched out after a half to press the issue racing into the far turn, dueled between foes into
upper stretch and came up empty leaving the furlong marker. GLAMORIZED broke inwards bumping SUMMER'S INDY, was righted to track the pacesetter
outside a rival racing to the backstretch but steadily retreated after a half. SUMMER'S INDY, off slowly, then bumped and squeezed between rivals at the
start, failed to menace thereafter.

clear. HOME IT TIZ settled at the rear, saved ground through the turn, was taken out toward the center of the track in upper stretch, rallied with good
interest and got up for the place in time. GUARD YOUR GRILL bobbled at the break, attended the pace three wide between horses, raced four wide into the
stretch, fought on despite proving no match for the winner in the final furlong, and was nabbed for place in the final strides. AZUSA ST. stumbled at the
break, tracked four wide, came five wide into the lane, and was outfinished. HIGH HERO was bumped between TIZ TOO MUCH and DEANO in the opening
strides, set a pressured pace between horses, floated out into the lane, was headed in upper stretch and outfinished. TIZ TOO MUCH broke outward and
bumped HIGH HERO, pressed the pace inside that foe, came into the lane under a drive inside, briefly led in upper stretch, was headed approaching the
furlong mark by DEANO, and flattened out. WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG was pushed in the opening strides but outsprinted for speed, chased at the inside
of a compact main field early, settled at the back of the main group approaching the half, brushed with ETHAN'S FURY, chased in the two path on the turn
inside of DEANO, kept on with interest behind traffic in the lane but was ultimately outfinished. ETHAN'S FURY chased between horses briefly before
settling at the back of the main group, brushed with WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG near the half, lost ground two wide on the far turn, and was empty for the
drive.

ENZOEXPRESS broke sharply, sped clear under prompting along the inside, dictated the pace on a clear margin into the stretch widened late under brisk
left handed encouragement. MAGI, urged to a forward placing in the four path tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the turn, continued with a steady
effort in that path to late stages and proved best of the others. HAUNTED MESA tracked just off the first flight between foes racing into the turn, advanced to
lodge a brief bid racing into upper stretch but flattened out in the closing stages. W W RUSSIAN GOLD settled between foes in the last flight racing to the
turn and improved position three deep between rivals in late stages. ANDREWS BOOGIE settled inside foes in the opening quarter, saved ground to the
lane, then came around a tiring foe while finishing evenly inside rivals. YOU SAY SO angled to the inside early tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the
turn and gave way into upper stretch. J Z'S LAST TRY tracked off the first flight outside foes racing into the turn, drifted wide entering the lane and steadily
faded. MAJESTIC HERO, off slowly, raced wide to the lane while proving no threat.

Footnotes
CHAINMAIL pressed the pace outside of PARA VIVIR, drove to the lead past the quarter pole, and drove clear of the field in the final furlong. VIVA
FOREVER tracked the leading pair two wide through the first turn, tracked between down the backstretch, was pushed along between horses around the
second turn, was driven three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the winner but kept on best of the rest. PRESENT OF HERO settled in second
last through the first turn, was relegated to the rear after PAULETTE pulled into the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, was driven up the inside
into the lane, bumped DARLIN ROSIE when taken two wide to get around the fading PARA VIVIR past the eighth, and kept on for show. PARA VIVIR set
the pace while pressured by CHAINMAIL, was headed by that foe past the quarter pole, resisted to the furlong mark, and weakened. DARLIN ROSIE
tracked the leading pair inside of VIVA FOREVER, came into the lane two wide, was bumped by PRESENT OF HERO past the furlong mark, and flattened
out. PAULETTE was restless in the gate, broke inward and hit the gate, settled last on the clubhouse turn, pulled to join the tracking flight three wide on the
backstretch run, was driven three wide on the far turn, and emptied out approaching the quarter pole.

Footnotes
ROYAL MISSION angled to the inside gaining a position tracking just off the leaders racing into the bend, tipped outside the pacesetter entering upper
stretch and continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm left handed pressure. DOROTA tracked off the second flight
along the inside racing to the turn, swung four wide nearing upper stretch advancing to challenge, ducked inwards into the path of CAT ATTACK, but was
righted quickly to edge a rival for the place honors on the wire. PERFECTIONTODETAIL broke sharply, angled to the rail dictating the pace on a narrow
margin racing into the turn, edged clear in upper stretch but couldn't fend off the top pair while just lasting for a share. JOAN'S WAY broke slowly, saved
ground racing into the turn, shifted out to split foes racing into upper stretch, then angled back to the inside while finding her best stride in the closing stages.
MAUREENLOVESFRANK shifted inwards just after the start, then settled out of striking distance racing to the turn, angled four wide racing into the lane and
gained some position while finishing evenly late. CAT ATTACK, forwardly placed tracking just off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted three
wide racing into upper stretch while advancing to challenge, was forced inwards avoiding a drifting rival midstretch and quickly came up empty. CREAL
SUGAR, reluctant to load, was slow into stride while appearing to alter course avoiding some traffic in the opening stages, angled to the inside racing into
the stretch but had no late bid. BIT O BODIE tracked off the second flight inside foes racing to the turn but offered no rally. AVASARALA, reluctant to load,
tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening quarter, angled five wide nearing upper stretch and quickly came up empty. PRINCESS STELLA
(IRE), urged prompting a rival's pace racing into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. DARE TO HOPE settled outside foes and dropped back early.
