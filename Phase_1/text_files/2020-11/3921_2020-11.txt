three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, shook off his main pace rival and was confronted by the runner up, dug in under threat and gamely repelled
the challenge to the finish. BLURT four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a
bid to challenge through the final furlong latched on the aforementioned foe to the outside but could not go by and was rebuffed to the finish. REUNION
TOUR coaxed from the gate, dueled from the five path down the backstretch with RE CREATED to his inside, tucked three wide through the turn coaxed
along from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away and weakened.

Footnotes
SHOP GIRL remained forwardly placed after getting away to an apparent clean start, cut over into the three path prior to departing the backstretch, disputed
the pace as the widest of a trio for the opening half, got roused turning into the stretch, forged to the front during the ensuing furlong as the three-way tussle
continued, dug in with good determination to preserve the decision. MUN LUV away well, disputed the pace from path two in between rivals from the
shadow of the gate until the shadow of the wire, came under a ride as the second split was being finalized, saw the winner edge clear, stayed on for the
place. SWAY ME bumped with IN VAIN after coming in at the start, got guided over to the inside route, drafted behind MY DELICIOUS until the end of the
bend, tipped into the two path at the head of the stretch, made no headway en route for show honors. MY DELICIOUS sent over to the inside, argued as the
innermost of a threesome for practically the whole event, weakened late. EXCEPT TEMPTATION got set in path two on the backstretch, was in hand
ranging up to the front runners during the run around the bend, got worked into path four from upper to midlane, flattened out in the final sixteenth. PALM
COURT strung out five wide on the turn, fanned out into path six during the early stages of the stretch drive, had no closing punch after undergoing the
widest trip of all. A HIGHER LOVE four wide on the turn, got sent out into path five exiting it, backed away. IN VAIN bumped at the start, was firmly rated
tracking the front runners from the rail during the initial stages, stepped into the stretch and faltered. RICELLE pursued the pace from path two on the turn,
commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, wound up nearly trailing throughout.

Footnotes
SPIN A YARN sparred for control towards the two path, led the competition into the stretch, kept clear under good handling. IMPAZIBLE DONNA vied for
the top three wide on the turn, was a bit closer to the rail contending for the advantage during the stretch run, got staved off. HONEY MONEY tracked the
pace from the inside, cut the corner into the lane, had no rallly. RUVIES IN TIME sat within striking distance from path two, stepped into the lane, lacked the
necessary response. ELLARELLA pursued the pace while being four wide, never made her presence felt. ALPHADORA two to three wide, gave way.
WAILIN JOSIE in path four departing the backstretch, got sent out six wide exiting the turn, failed to menace. CHEATHAM HILL took up the chase from the
three path after shying slightly from DUBLINORNOTHIN at the break, was sighted three wide at the top of the turn, got tipped into path five at the top of the
lane to no avail. DUBLINORNOTHIN corrected after starting to break to the outside, appeared sluggish brining up the back of the pack on the backstretch,
travelled two to three wide on the turn, was in the four path strolling into the stretch, straightened away and was allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
CITY MAN tracked the pace just off the inside in range of the front settled into a loose pocket, remained patiently handled until angled out four wide into
upper stretch set down for the drive, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong dueling with the runner up in game fashion to the finish and just got
the nod on the wire. BODECREAM three wide in aim of the leader early on, advanced to prompt that rival nine-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, took over command spinning three wide into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in dueling through to the
finish gamely but lost the bob on the line. PRICE TALK in a bit tight between foes shortly after the start, chased four then three wide coaxed along from the
three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, closed well for the last major share. BASQUIAT bumped at the start by SAIL AT SUNRISE,
who broke outwards, chased three to four wide under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. ME AND
MR. C chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, kept on one paced to the finish and was
outkicked. STARTING OVER chased four then five wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, weakened in the stretch. DOC
BOY chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. RECONVENE just off the inside
in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. SAIL AT SUNRISE broke out at the start
bumping BASQUIAT, showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under some pressure from BODECREAM to the outside from the nine-sixteenths,
came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, yielded the front and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

SUZ away alertly, cemented herself to the top after being put to a light hand ride, inched its way towards the rail, getting there by the conclusion of the
backstretch, showed the way, gradually kicked clear on the turn, got set down hard spinning into the stretch, emerged a furlong later holding her largest
advantage, saw the runner up readily cut into it leaving the eighth pole, but dug in late to prevail. SIRENIC settled into midpack, travelled three to four wide
on the turn, swung out five wide into the stretch, rallied with willingness, missed. FAIR LASSIE glided over to the rail at the top of the turn, stayed put, cut
the corner into the lane, mustered up a mild response for the show. MISS LIANA sat forwardly placed along the inside route, tipped into the two path for the
stretch drive, couldn't close in. DI pursued the pace from path two, was still in it stepping into the stretch, gained some, but without making much of an
impact. TROPICAL JOY stalked the winner from the two path and gave way. HARDSTONEMELODY three wide, shifted into the four path in upper stretch,
backed away. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY bobbled at the start, brought up the back of the pack for nearly a half, stationed in path two on the turn, angled four
wide into the stretch, had no offering. TIED UP pursued the pace from path two, pulling noticeably on the left side for much of the opening half, was moved
out one path farther off the rail entering the stretch, gave way, returned to the paddock in distress, subsequently collapsed fatally. NO DEAL saved ground
for the opening half, came three wide into the lane and was allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
MRS. DANVERS away alertly, established the top, glided over to the rail approaching the end of the homestretch, got pounced upon by PROJECT
WHISKEY shortly after entering the backstretch, eventually getting necked by that foe between calls along it, re-asserted herself and grabbed back the lead
as the second fraction was being finalized, came under pressure from challenger number three in the form of GALE stepping onto the far turn, successfully
fended off that opponent, was deep into the furlong grounds and well in front when finally called upon for more, responded to preserve the decision. ICE
PRINCESS off the inside throughout, travelled three wide on the far turn, after being in the two path prior, stepped into the stretch having been set down a
sixteenth earlier, proved no match. THANKFUL underwent a three to four wide journey, went into the stretch and went on to secure the show. TONED UP
saved ground to the of the second bend, angled three wide into the stretch, earned the last major check by improving position. GALE stumbled in the
shadow gate bumping with PROJECT WHISKEY, chased the pace three wide until the half mile pole, left that station and went on to press the issue from
path two with the tempo having picked up quite a bit, kept at the task until the top of the lane then folded. MISS MARISSA lost her footing springing from the
starting gate, recovered in short order, kept watch on the winner from the rail, slipped into the two path in time for the drive home, gave way. PROJECT
WHISKEY bumped right after the field had been released, was parked out four wide on the clubhouse bend, attained a narrow advantage mustering up an
abbreviated bid between calls on the backstretch before getting flicked off, left if from path two, steadily fell back on turn two, then continued to fall back
steadily in the stretch. MY SWEET WIFE took up the chase two wide on the turn, got moved into path three spinning into the lane, was never in it.

Footnotes
LOKOYA ROAD forwardly placed three wide, wrested away the advantage and edged away during the run around the bend after having out-fought a
twosome to his inside, settled in for the drive and got cued up in the general area of the three-sixteenths marker,, kicked away to lead by its largest margin
by the beginning of the final furlong, held on well late to preserve the decision. THIS ILL DEFEND took the inside route for three-quarters, angled five wide
onto the top of the lane, had a good finish down the center of the strip to procure the place. BOURBON RISING along the outside, raced three wide on the
turn, commenced the stretch one path wider, went fairly evenly late en route for third. PRINCE OF CAPS pursued the pace two wide, swung into the lane,
flattened out. ACCESSIBLE took up position in midpack, travelled two to three wide on the turn, flashed some interest as six furlongs was being rattled off,
saw it fizzle out, making no headway in the last eighth. FEELING DANGEROUS two wide onto the turn, angled six wide exiting it, made no impact.
CHAMPERS glided over to the rail on the chute, felt pressure from a pair of opponents on the turn, gave in and backed away. INAPPROPRIATE saved
ground to no avail. LIL JOJO rushed up along the chute to a forward position, disputed the pace from path two, between rivals for a good portion of the
journey leading up to the three-eighths pole, called it a day at that station and retreated steadily. ACROSS THE CHANNEL trailed while riding the rail.
