Footnotes
GHOST STALKER prompted the pace from the outside five then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, rallied
to take command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive inching away to the finish. K T'S JILTED GROOM chased just off the inside until tucked inside
at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, cut the corner into upper stretch, tipped out to the two path nearing the
three-sixteenths, then tipped an additional two paths bumping BLACK 'N TAN and forcing that rival to briefly steady, offered up a mild kick to chase the
winner home while well clear of the rest for the place honors. SINASHACK grew fractious in the gate prior to the start, then got bumped between foes who
each broke his way at the start and got away last, chased two to three wide detached at the tail of the field striding a bit greenly, went four wide through the
turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors in the late stages.
STRETCH THE TRUTH broke out at the start under hustling and bumped K T'S JILTED GROOM in tandem with CENTAVO, who broke inwards, showed
the way in hand along the inside under pressure from a trio early on and then a pair through the turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cut the
corner into upper stretch and yielded the front three-sixteenths out, then weakened through to the finish. BLACK 'N TAN pressed the pace three then two
wide between foes coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, was in the midst of backing away when bumped and
forced to steady briefly as K T'S JILTED GROOM tipped out at the three-sixteenths, then continued to back away to the finish. CENTAVO broke in at the
start bumping SINASHACK in concert with STRETCH THE TRUTH who broke outwards, showed brief speed four wide down the backstretch applying
pressure to the leader, tucked three wide through the turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, retreated through the turn, went three to four wide
into upper stretch and folded. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on K T'S JILTED GROOM in upper stretch before the result stood
and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
TWO CENT TOOTSIE reserved off the inside until the conclusion of the backstretch, departed it from path three, crept up to the front runners, joining up
with them midpoint on the far turn, contended as the widest from that juncture all the way to the sixteenth pole, challenged in earnest spinning onto the top
of the lane, emerged an eighth down the road as the new leader, steadily extended the winning margin. KILKEA dragged into the gate, proceeded to come
away without apparent mishap, tucked into path two after being mostly three wide on the clubhouse bend, pressed the issue, hitched up to PANDAMOM,
was forced to go about the task from between rivals once the winner arrived on the scene, this occurring in the general area of the three-eighths pole, turned
for home being roused, saw the top one forge to the front, ventured onward with willingness salvaging second. TIMELESS JOURNEY strung out three wide
on the first turn, got guided over to the hedge for a ground-saving respite on the subsequent one, got cued maneuvering to the outside after six furlongs had
been reeled off, was gradually worked towards path three from upper to midlane, closed in well, missed the place. PANDAMOM retained the advantage
after breaking on top, showed the way from along the inside route, shadowed by KILKEA out in the two path, was forced to fend off yet another foe, that
being the eventual winner, from around the three-eighths pole, got set down cutting the corner into the lane, relinquished before safely through the furlong
grounds, steadily weakened. AMOS raced three wide on the turns, got sent out into path six during the opening phases of the stretch run, made no
headway. COREY SCORES rode the hedge after stumbling at the start, unleashed a mild run from the head of the stretch to the eighth pole, then flattened
out. PIONEEROF NEW YORK two wide early, moved closer to the inside coming up to the half mile pole, got asked for more springing from the
five-sixteenths marker, angled five wide into the lane, gave way. DELLA LUTE underwent a two wide pursuit, was never a menace.

to take over command near that station and got roused spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in
kept to task to prevail clear on the wire. WOW pulled on the bit out of the dog legged chute into the backstretch and was hard held off the heels of a rival
bobbling on the course near the seven-eighths pole while along the inside, gradually tipped out two then three wide down the backstretch settled in mid
pack, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out slightly and
bumped with CADENCIA straightened away when jostling for a seam, then dug in running on willingly to the finish to cut into the winner's margin and secure
the place honors on the line. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (IRE) forwardly placed three wide from the gate, remained unhurried and steadily lost position as
rivals advanced outside to mid pack, remained on hold nearing the tail of the field with five-sixteenths remaining, got set down spinning four wide into upper
stretch, angled out herding out FRANKEL AT ASCOT three paths from the three-sixteenths to the eighth pole and came again kicking on belatedly with
good energy to secure the show honors. CADENCIA tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket, got set down angled three wide into upper stretch,
bumped with WOW straightened away when fighting for a seam between rivals, then ran on to procure the last major share. FOOL YOURSELF broke in at
the start brushing NEVER CONTENT, raced three to four wide in pursuit from near the rear, began to advanced to mid pack, midway on the far turn and
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to the finish but was outfinished. IRISH
CRUSH (IRE) three to four wide in pursuit from near the rear down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the far turn, came under coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. FRANKEL AT ASCOT (FR) chased three to four
wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home, dug in under a drive and got herded out three paths from the
three-sixteenths to the eighth pole as TECHNICAL ANALYSIS tipped out from her inside, then weakened in the late going. NEVER CONTENT (IRE)
brushed at the start by FOOL YOURSELF who broke inwards, chased two to three wide from the tail of the field coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SINGLE SOUL (GB) five wide in pursuit from near the rear, advanced five wide through
the far turn into contention five-sixteenths from home, continued five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. REINA DEL SOL lunged at
the break, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch early on before advancing given some rein to work with midway, ranged up to be just
off the pace when tucked four wide into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and weakened. MY SECOND
CHANCE established the front and showed the way rated on the pace along the inside, got headed near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch
roused and tired in the drive. MISS EMPIREMENT just off the pace four then three wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for
home and faltered.

Footnotes
SHE'S A BLACK BELT sparred for control from the two path, was confidently ridden taking over the advantage as the half was being completed, moved into
path three on her accord and was called upon for more at the three-sixteenths marker, kicked away to her largest lead during the rest of the trip leading up
to the furlong marker, kept going well in the late to stages to remain sufficiently in the clear. LA NEGRITA lightly bumped at the break, tracked the front
runners saving ground for the first half, was moved out four wide for the drive, got staved off. SHANNON'S GIRL two wide onto the turn, angled six wide
leaving it, went on to secure the show. QUEENDOM out a bit after losing her footing springing from the gate, shouldered its next stall neighbor, departed the
backstretch from path four, got maneuvered all the way towards path eight from upper to midlane, venturing onward as the widest of all, closed in steadily
for the last major check. CRUISING STRONG cut over to the rail after bumping lightly with LA NEGRITA, rode it until the end of the bend, tipped out two
wide at the top of the lane, came up empty. HANDLE WITH CARE took up the chase from path two, between rivals on the turn, got maneuvered into path
five once in the stretch, made no headway. CHARLOTTE WEBLEY guided over to the rail on the backstretch, swung out five wide for the drive, backed
away. SARAHRINI three wide entering the turn, was about five wide exiting it, tired. DAZZLING SPEED settled towards the back of the pack, travelled three
wide on the turn, got sent out into path seven during the initial portion of the stretch to no avail. ALL OVER THE MAP disputed the pace from along the
inside for a half, faded.

Footnotes
BARLEEWON kept watch on the pace from the pocket for three-quarters, slipped to the outside leaving the five-sixteenths marker, inched up to the ones to
catch, got let loose, vied as the widest of three for the lead to the three-sixteenths pole then afterwards one on one with STANHOPE, was determined to the
end and got the job done. SUPER WICKED CHARM unhurried two wide early, was maneuvered into the four path approaching the five-sixteenths pole,
shifted a bit wider entering the stretch, launched a five wide rally to be along for the place. SHOOTIN THE BREEZE pursued the pace at or near the inside
for nearly six furlongs, got sent out approximately four wide into the stretch, clawed his way into the show slot. STANHOPE quickly established the front
end, was held in reserve showing the way from along the inside route, got put to the test by a pair of opponents from the outside in the general area of the
quarter pole, left the next station locked in a tussle with the winner, was right there to the wire, only to ultimately have to settle for half of the final significant
slice of the purse. RECKLESS SPIRIT strung out five wide on the opening bend, was four wide entering and exiting turn two, stayed on during the stretch
run to finish in a tie for fourth. THENORTHREMEMBERS four wide on the clubhouse bend, resumed its chase of the pace one path closer to the rail until
the five-sixteenths pole, got guided onto the inside, getting there in time to cut the corner into the streetch, made no headway. MITZRAYIM prompted the
pace from path two, mustered up an abbreviated bid from the head of the stretch to the three-sixteenths pole, faltered. FREEDOM AND WHISKY saved
ground to no avail. BEACHSIDE mainly three wide until the quarter pole, commenced the stretch slightly wider on empty. ONE EYED JACK underwent a
three wide trip or the first six furlongs, gave way. JOY CITY hung out in the three path on both turns, was never in it. RIGHTDOWNGENTLEMEN two wide,
was through after going three-quarters.

Footnotes
INGRASSIA sat within striking distance at or near the inside for the opening three-quarters, was ridden four wide into the lane, altered course into path two
at the furlong grounds when FLUFFY SOCKS began to drift out, got engaged in a late duel with the aforementioned rival and gamely got there. FLUFFY
SOCKS reserved two wide during the opening phases, launched itself into contention with a quick four wide move as three-quarters was being completed,
swung about as wide into the lane, forged to the front, began to drift out right around the eighth pole, went at it on even terms with the winner late, but with
lanes of separation between them, lost the bob. TIC TIC TIC BOOM three wide on the first turn, took up chase one path closer to the rail thereafter, angled
back into path three for the drive, rallied for the show. CALDEE prompted the pace two wide for three-quarters and gave way. MISCHIEVOUS DREAM
underwent a ground-saving journey, had no response. ZEYARAAT pursued the pace two wide, went into path four coming into the stretch, made no impact.
PSYCHIC ABILITY argued for the top from the inside until the quarter pole, faltered. GOLDEN VOICE two wide until the end of the second bend, folded.
