Footnotes
MIA MARTINA settled off the pace along the inside, made progress two wide around the far turn, angled four wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and
was up late. STARSHIP NTERPRISE saved ground in range for a half, angled four wide nearing the far turn, moved to the front four deep near the
three-sixteenths pole, led through most of the stretch and was run down late. SOUPER ALL STAR led early, settled back inside, angled out in upper stretch,
rallied between rivals and was in tight in the late yards. MAKE ME LAUGH advanced two wide to the lead around the first turn, cleared early on the
backstretch, set the pace along the rail to upper stretch, fought on to midstretch and weakened in the final furlong. MARLBOROUGH ROAD (IRE) stalked
the pace two wide, bid between foes around the far turn and faded in the lane. DREAMING OF AUDREY lagged well back while racing two wide, swung to
the far outside in upper stretch and showed some late interest. FATE OF OPHELIA failed to menace while racing two wide. WILD WALKOFF saved ground
to no avail. BELLA SOFI had speed three wide and tired in the lane. KINKY FROLIC was outrun while racing three wide early and saving ground rounding
the far turn. The three-quarters time has been omitted due to a timer malfunction.

Footnotes
TOO STYLISH contested the early pace outside ISADELAS DREAM, shook clear around the turn, and was driving to remain in command.
MYCRAZYXGIRLFRIEND lost ground to the leaders around the turn, shifted off the inside to the three-path leaving the quarter-pole, lugged in under
pressure and could not gain late while best of the rest. ISADELAS DREAM set the early pace inside, could not keep up with the winner around the turn, and
faded while able to salvage the show. CHATTIN WITH JENNY raced three wide and faded steadily through the lane. TRINNI CUTIE PIE was outrun
throughout. KAY'S DREAM lunged and broke out spotting the field a couple lengths, and never recovered.

Footnotes
UNCAGE THE CAT stalked the pace two wide, reached near even terms outside of DISCREET TUNE near the three-eighths pole, bumped with that rival in
upper stretch, brushed near the eighth pole and bumped again near the sixteenth pole and drove clear late. DISCREET TUNE set the pace along the rail,
bumped with the winner in upper stretch, brushed near the eighth pole, was bumped near the sixteenth pole and yielded late. ROMARIO tracked the top two
finishers three wide, angled in in the stretch and finished evenly to maintain third. WORDMAN lacked early speed, raced two wide around the turn, angled
out in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. TREASURE RUN saved ground in midpack, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a rally. DEAL
TWO checked early, raced three wide around the turn and never threatened. WILDWOOD FURY was outrun inside. REALTOR DANNY D chased the pace
two wide and faded. METEORITO steadied while breaking out at the start, saved ground and was outrun. ESCRIBANO steadied entering the turn, angled
four wide soon after and played no further factor. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND FOUND NO REASON
TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
DREAM MARIE pressed ITSMYLUCKYCHARM from outside, took over after five furlongs going comfortably, and widened through the stretch hand urged.
VICTORY CRUSADE saved ground to the far turn, lacked room in the two-path coming to the three-sixteenths, angled to the far outside and went clear of
the remainder. ALIZEE raced in striking range three wide for six furlongs, and weakened. CHOOSE JOY broke awkwardly, moved out four wide on the first
turn, and never factored. ITSMYLUCKYCHARM set the pace hounded by the eventual winner, proved no match around the far turn, and tired.

BLACK JET tracked the pace from the rail, angled out in upper stretch, split rivals leaving the eighth pole, dueled outside of GRAN MALBEC through the
final sixteenth and prevailed. GRAN MALBEC saved ground well back, closed inside, took the lead near the sixteenth pole, vied inside of the winner from
there and just missed. OAK BLUFFS was unhurried inside early, angled out in upper stretch and rallied outside. MARCELINO bumped at the start, saved
ground well back and rallied belatedly. DAD'S YANKEES pressed the pace two wide and tired in the lane. MAR VISTA MIGUEL set a pressured pace along
the rail and weakened in the final furlong. R BOY BODE played no factor while racing two wide. ANOTHER SOFTBALL was pinched back a the break,
raced three wide and never threatened. GAME BOY BENNY was outrun outside. RED HOT LOOKS stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the
lane.

MY GLORY saved ground unhurried to the stretch, shifted to the two-path through the furlong grounds, and wore down HOT BABE from outside past the
70-yard marker. HOT BABE sprinted to the front early and moved inside, remained clear to the sixteenth-pole, then yielded to the winner. I'M A COCO

and tired. CAIRO'S HEIRESS was two wide around the turn, and tired through the lane inside. NAJWA faded steadily three wide.

Footnotes
AIZU set the pace along the rail and widened under a drive. KATAMA MOONLIGHT stalked the winner from the rail, tipped two wide early on the far turn,
edged closer around the bend but was no match for the winner in the lane. EMMA ROSE saved ground well back and was along for the show. LADY
ROSALIE (IRE) saved ground well back, went three wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. ANYTHING GOES chased the pace two wide and
weakened in the lane. SING ME HOME (GB) failed to menace while racing two wide. SHE'S JUST QUALITY was outrun inside. MADDOX pressed the
winner two wide for a half, got out around the far turn, was pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
IMA DAREDEVIL advanced rapidly around the turn outside rivals, took over from BAHAMIAN GIRL into the lane and kicked clear, then staved off
BACCARAT FASHION through the closing yards. BACCARAT FASHION moved up into tight quarters past the half-mile marker, steadied along near the
inside lacking room around the turn, shifted out to the three-path at the head of the stretch, lugged in to the rail past the eighth-pole, surged late inside the
winner but came up short. WORTH AVENUE saved ground outrun to the stretch, and was going well too late. WITCH HUNTER bumped with BROOKES
ALL MINE at the start, lagged well back to the stretch three wide, and passed tired horses. BAHAMIAN GIRL hustled to the front after the start, showed the
way inside to the top of the stretch, and gave way. BROOKES ALL MINE bumped with WITCH HUNTER at the start, raced four to five wide, and lacked a
response. FREE TO FLY raced four to five wide, and was never close. PANAREA showed some early speed, and faded four wide after a half-mile.
NONCENTS pressed BAHAMIAN GIRL from outside, and had nothing left into the stretch.

Footnotes
HENRY'S WORLD set the pace in the two path and held firm under left-handed urging. THE VIRGINIAN stalked the winner in the clear in the three path,
could not gain on that foe and just lasted for the place. BALISTICO saved ground in range, angled out near the eighth pole, continued on the left lead in the
lane, rallied between foes and just missed second. KANTHAROS' IMAGE chased the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, rallied outside and
just missed both second and third. R MAN JOE raced two wide and never threatened. FRENCHMEN STREET saved ground and failed to menace.
HAUNTEDBYTHEMUSIC broke about two lengths behind the field, raced in the three path and never threatened. TALE OF KANTHAROS was not a factor
while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
TONY'S ROSE eyed the leaders saving ground into the turn, shifted out three wide approaching the stretch, bumped lightly with COOKIE COVE while
moving past that one a furlong out, then wore down GITANA while staying on her left lead. GITANA set the early pace inside with several rivals in pursuit,
stayed on with good courage through the lane but could not withstand the top one. DRYNACHAN hit the left side of the gate at the start, advanced two to
three wide turning for home, and finished willingly. MISS LORETTA brushed with SHELL BEACH PARTY at the start, saved ground and improved through
the stretch without threatening. COOKIE COVE pressed the pace three wide between horses, and bumped lightly with TONY'S ROSE while tiring in mid
stretch. BABY ALIDETT was two wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and made no headway. ZIP IT JESS pressed the pace two wide between
horses, moved in approaching the stretch and gave way. SHELL BEACH PARTY brushed with MISS LORETTA at the start, and was outrun. FLYING
SOFIA dropped back around the turn while four or five wide. BELLA BIONDA gave chase four wide for three-eighths of a mile, and had nothing left.
