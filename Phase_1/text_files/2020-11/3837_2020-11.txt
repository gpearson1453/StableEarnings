Footnotes
EARTHQUAKE raced off the pace, made a four wide run on the far turn, rallied outside entering the stretch, closed steadily outside and was up late to win
going away. HEART OF A DREAMER set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the far turn, responded when roused, dug in gamely in the
stretch drive and was caught nearing the wire. DIZZY SIGHT tracked close up on the inside, chased on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and finished
evenly. SURFER BOY GEORGE stalked three wide, then chased and had no rally. SINCERE MAN raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the
backside, then lacked a rally. YONDERING stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn and tired. MUNTAHEZ was outrun.

Footnotes
WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT didn't break alertly, hustled up to race just off rail and just off the pace, eased out five wide into stretch, closed determinedly and
took the lead inside sixteenth marker. TIZ A KITTEN broke sharply, was three wide early, split rivals into stretch, took the lead briefly nearing sixteenth pole
but was outfinished. LITTLEBITALILY lapped on winner early, rallied four wide into stretch, took the lead with a furlong to run and then held on tenaciously.
BOW TOWN CAT broke slowly, was hustled up inside to duel for a half mile then tired. MIDNIGHT SKY saved ground while outrun, moved out into stretch,
lugged in through stretch and failed to menace. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR between foes, moved wider on turn and into stretch and was no factor. MEMORIZE
bobbled leaving the gate, dueled two wide then tired. BEATUBYACHUBINOSE, three wide, failed to menace. BARLEY JACK WAS ORDERED
SCRATCHED. A CONSULATION DAILY DOUBLE WAS PAID. All other wagers on her were refunded.

Footnotes
CHIEF EXCHANGER, broke well after an extremely load gate load, was four wide early, angled in before leaving the backstretch, never left the rail
thereafter, took the lead leaving quarter and won under a drive. PSYCHIC ENERGY vied for command three wide, was unable to keep pace with winner but
finished well in a good effort. EARLY ENTRY, two wide early, moved out near stretch and finished well. PEGASUS RED, between rivals while not far back,
also moved to the outside for the stretch run but had no late kick. VERY COLORFUL dueled for command between rivals then gave way. BLINDING, racing
in the three path, failed to menace. SARATOGA WILDCAT was very wide and not a serious threat. SMART RAGS ducked in sharply at the start then was
never a factor. DOWN WITH THE KING raced wide and showed little. NINETYEIGHTOCTANE was never a threat. JACKS A WARRIOR broke slowly, was
hustled up inside to race just off the pace then gave way. FOREST RIVER also broke slowly, was hustled up inside to duel, stopped suddenly and was
being eased through much of the stretch.

ZENSATIONAL DIXIE was outrun early, offered an eye catching run around rivals on the turn, took the lead deep stretch and edged away drifting in late.
YOUR PAL saved ground, waited for racing room midway on the turn to the quarter pole, eased out and then raced between foes through deep stretch and
was just up for place. SHERO vied for command three wide, took the lead near quarter pole and then weakened late. LUCKY MILADY was wide and not far
back, lacked a strong closing kick. PAOLLA'S HEART, in the four path early, drifted out badly through stretch. TEAM WIN raced very wide early and also
drifted out badly through stretch. GODDESS OF CASH dueled for command along the rail before tiring. WINGS OF FURY rallied four wide on the far turn
and then gave way. PADRINONEVERQUITS, between rivals dueling for the lead, tired. SWEET LILLY FACTUM was always far back.

was bumped at the five furlong marker, then chased between rivals, rallied into the stretch and dug in gamely to the end. LOAN ME YOUR EAR was
bumped hard at the five furlong marker, stalked two wide, raced between rivals on the turn and rallied mildly inside. TACTICAL PURSUIT (IRE) hesitated
and was off slowly, raced off the rail, off the pace, came five wide into the lane and closed belatedly. THEY SHOT SONNY tracked inside, chased on the
turn and weakened. PHARAOH'S CITY raced off the pace inside, came four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. FOLLOWHISFOOTSTEPS drifted in
bumping rivals near the five eighths marker, then stalked three wide, raced three wide on the turn and faded. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of
METAPHORICAL against the winner was dismissed.

steered out very wide to avoid heels racing into the first turn, remained wide while advancing and was drawing away from the others. TACTICAL PLAN, well
placed just off the rail, weakened through deep stretch. STORM TALES raced wide and found best stride too late. AMERICAN ROMA saved ground early,
went two wide on the backstretch, remained a factor to early stretch then gave way. MANTLE broke sharply after yet another extended gate load, saved
ground while never far back then tired. BANKER'S ISLAND was bumped and forced out racing into the first turn, saved ground and failed to menace.
HOWBOUTDEMPATS raced outside and showed little. DIAMOND SQUARE came out and bumped OUT OF LINE racing into first turn, was well placed
between rivals before stopping. OUT OF LINE was bumped by DIAMOND SQUARE into BANKER'S ISLAND racing into the first turn, was wide and just off
the early pace then gave way steadily. RINGS OF JUPITER raced wide and tired badly. HIGH FLYING GUY WAS SCRATCHED ON THE VETERINARIAN.

Footnotes
LADY MUNNINGS racing outside, rallied four wide into stretch and took the lead near furlong grounds then drew off with speed to spare. EASY BANKER
was four wide early, then three wide taking the lead, resisted when challenged but was no match. LADY VALENTINA angled in after the start, was well
placed between foes then weakened late. TWO CARAT saved ground, swung out moving but failed to menace. SKOOKIE stumbled leaving the gate, saved
ground early, moved out but was not a threat. NOT IN THE MOOD raced wide and failed to menace. WOMAN FLYER dueled for command in the four path
then gave way. BAAQEYA raced wide, bid on the turn then tired. DEEP CANYON saved ground setting the pace and had little left. LA FLAMENCA
hesitated leaving the gate, was hustled to race just off pace then tired. REIGNING FIRE broke through the gate prior to the start then showed little. YOURS
COMPLETELY broke slowly and was pulled up in apparent distress in the opening quarter mile and vanned off.
