Footnotes
SHE'S FOREVER chased the pace early on, was in the five path into the lane, rallied in the stretch, drove past the leaders three wide, drew off and was
geared down in the final stages. QUEENS GIFT set the pace early on, was on the inside into the lane, clung to the lead near the eighth pole but was
overtaken and no match for the winner in the final stages. TWIRLING PATTI was unprepared at the start and broke way back, was rushed up into
contention along the backstretch, made a three wide bid, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. WAR ENSIGN bobbled at
the start, stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch drive. PLAYFULMISSSAMURAI pressed the pace
early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. VELSHEDA trailed the field throughout.

stages but held place. THE BEAT trailed the field while far back early on, was on the inside into the lane, rallied down the lane but gained much too late and
did not have enough for place in the final stages. PASSAGEWAY set the pace early along the inside, was off the rail into the lane and gave way down the

SIDETOWN set the pace early, cleared the field nearing the lane, was off the rail into the lane then drew off down the lane under a steady drive. LEND IT
TEWMEY came out then bumped and bothered EL SEGUNDO along the backstretch, pressed the leader along the turn, was in the three path into the lane
and no match for the winner in the stretch run. JEDREK raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. O DOGG
broke slowly from the gate and raced back early on, was off the rail into the lane and improved position down the lane. EL SEGUNDO was bumped and
bothered along the backstretch by LEND IT TEWMEY while stalking the pace, was in the three path into the lane and faded in the stretch run. UNSPOKEN
MEMORIES was a bit slow at the start, chased the pace early on, was on the inside into the lane and empty in the stretch drive. CHARITY FOR ALL was a
bit slow at the start and no factor thereafter. BRONZE BEAST was a bit slow at the start and done early.

Footnotes
BARISTA tracked from midpack in the two path around the first turn, gained three wide and outside of foes around the far turn to take aim on the clear
leader in upper stretch, reached that rival and forged an advantage at the furlong pole, and drew off under driving pressure. ILLIOGAMI stalked two wide,
chased the loose leader from between horses around the far turn as BARISTA ranged up alongside, produced bid inside of that foe in upper stretch, but was
outkicked by that rival at the furlong pole, then held place in the late stages. SOVEREIGN POWER stalked along the inside, but was outkicked by wider
bidding foes in upper stretch, shifted out from behind those foes passing the furlong pole, then stayed on. FAMILY TIME saved ground off of the pace,
swung four, then five, wide in upper stretch, and chased the leaders evenly through the lane. TALK RADIO was off slowly, took the two path around while
far off of the pace, and failed to factor. WILD STORY cleared off and shifted to the rail around the first turn, held a loose lead around the far turn, but met
bids in upper stretch, then yielded passing the furlong pole. TARGETED RETURN broke outwardly, then saved ground far off of the pace and failed to
produce a rally. LADY CLEMENTINE tracked from off of the pace in the three path around both turns, shifted four wide turning for home, but faded before
menacing. FASTED was off slowly and shied from an inner foe at the start, trailed the field three wide around the far turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL TRAUMA set the pace along the inside, shook free from a pressing rival in hand at the five sixteenths pole while meeting a bid from FRENCH
EMPIRE, but swiftly repelled that foe passing the quarter pole, and drew off through the lane under driving pressure while hanging on his left lead. FRENCH
EMPIRE bobbled a bit at the start, trailed the field while staying outside of the kick back, rallied four wide into and around the turn to bid for the lead outside
of BEAUTIFUL TRAUMA turning for home, but quickly proved no match for that foe passing the quarter pole, and stayed well clear of show thereafter.
SECOND COMING tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, cleared his inner foe at the three furlong pole, then chased the leaders while
forging show in upper stretch, and failed to manace. RESURRECTION ROAD chased three wide, but was outmoved by an outer foe at the three furlong
pole, then failed to factor thereafter. SARA SEA pressed the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader while getting outkicked at the five
sixteenths pole, then faded. CHANCE TO SHINE saved ground off of the pace, but weakened at the three furlong pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
ABROGATE set the pace along the inside, repelled the bidding ZOOM UP passing the quarter pole, drew off under driving pressure in upper stretch, and
was geared down through the final sixteenth. ZOOM UP stalked three wide, bid for the lead outside of a pair of foes at the five sixteenths pole, but was
swiftly repelled by the inner leader passing the quarter pole, and proved second best. DAME CINCO bumped the gate at the start, pressed the eventual
winner two wide, then from between horses around the turn, but failed to keep pace with those foes passing the quarter pole, then chased them home while
holding show. MINE FOR PASSION rallied in the four path around the turn, but leveled out and failed to reach show. CARDIOVERSION stalked along the
inside, but failed to keep pace with the leaders passing the quarter pole. FROSTED ANGEL lunged a bit at the start, raced far off of the pace two wide into
the turn, shifted four wide turning for home, but lugged in in upper stretch, yet still improved through the lane. HOODWINK shied a bit inwards at the start,
lied forwardly placed in the two path, tipped four wide turning for home, but lacked a bid before weakening through the late stages. GOLDEN SWEETS
tracked
from
midpack
two
wide,
but
failed
to
factor.
ANTECEDENCE
lost
position
two
wide
around
the
turn
and

EKATIMORNINGSTRIKE was off slowly, trailed the field early on, took the turn three wide, and failed to make an impact. HRASKY was off a step slow,
saved ground off of the pace, but weakened turning for home. MI SANDIA was off slowly, and got outrun.

clear in midstretch, then flopped back to his left lead passing the sixteenth pole, and held. ATTORNEY TIM saved ground off of the pace around the first
turn, then took the far turn three to four wide before tipping six wide turning for home, but produced a rally, surged in the final furlong to produce a bid
approaching the wire, but missed. WINNING IMPRESSION bumped an inner foe and was jostled at the start, saved ground far off of the pace, tipped off of
the rail at the quarter pole, but was blocked behind horses in upper stretch, shifted in and rallied through the final furlong, but did not have enough to catch
the leaders, then took a bad step after the wire, broke down into the clubhouse turn, then was vanned off. CHURN N BURN broke outwardly, tracked from
midpack in the four to three paths around the turns, then chased the leaders through the lane before getting outkicked by an inner and an outer foe at the
sixteenth pole. LAKE NAKURU raced off of the pace three wide, four to five wide around the far turn, then chased between horses through the lane. MUD
PIE was wiped out by an outer foe at the start, raced far off of the pace, took the far turn four to five wide before being floated seven wide turning for home,
then failed to factor. KING THEO lied forwardly placed two wide around the turns, then chased the leaders three wide through midstretch before weakening
late. TOMA TODO set the pace along the inside, but was headed at the quarter pole, then faltered through the final furlong. PERJURY TRAP settled off of
the pace two wide, three to four wide around the far turn, but bumped with, and was outkicked by, his outer counterpart turning for home, then faded
thereafter. PARKLAND stalked along the inside, but was done at the three furlong pole, and stopped.

dueled with that foe through the lane, but proved no match for an outer oncharging rival at he sixteenth pole. SWEET WILLEMINA got squeezed between
horses at the start, raced far off of the pace five wide around the turn, then stayed on to reach show. TUFF BIRD prompted the pace two wide and between
