Footnotes
THE METHOD saved ground tucked in nicely behind the leaders to the far turn, shifted off the rail to the two-path to challenge into the stretch, and drew off
under pressure. WATER CAY settled in midpack early, came three wide off the far turn, and was up for the place. FEARLESS LION had aim three wide
approaching the lane, and was outkicked while staying on his left lead. GEOMETRICO took closer order after five furlongs, entered the stretch five or six
wide, and passed tired horses. TESTIFIED was four wide into the first turn, moved in after that but made no impact. ARTIE'S LADY was urged along
pressing the pace outside VALEROSO, and gave way into the stretch. BEAUTIFUL TIZ came under coaxing up the backstretch, and lacked the needed
response. VALEROSO was well out in the track with the lead entering the backstretch, moved in facing multiple challenges around the far turn, and checked
while giving way near the quarter-pole. LISA'S FIRST LOVE broke a step slow, went into the first turn five wide, and never got close. GRAY SOL raced
three to four wide, and faltered after six furlongs.

Footnotes
GODS BLESSING vied two wide down the backstretch, took the lead between rivals around the far turn, drifted out some turning for home and drove clear.
KATHERN'S JOY dueled inside of the winner and proved no match in the lane while holding well for the place. THE KUKRI stalked the pace three wide, bid
near the three-eighths pole but weakened in the lane and just lasted for the show. CHIPSHAPE chased the pace inside, angled four wide leaving the quarter
pole and lacked a rally. BIG CITY RED raced in range three wide and came up empty in the lane. KICK IT CHARLIE veered out at the start and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
STONE HANDS was never far back, stayed on task through the stretch, and overhauled KILLA DEE from outside in the closing strides. KILLA DEE set the
pace in the two-path, rolled along clear to the sixteenth-pole, and could not handle the winner late. PERFETTO raced three to four wide around the turn,
finished willingly and was up outside AREYOUTALKINGTOME for third nearing the wire. AREYOUTALKINGTOME stayed close to the stretch, and was
outfinished. MR WRENCH IT showed early speed, and weakened through the stretch on his left lead. BLACK PEPPER tossed his head at the break and
was off about three lengths slow, and never factored. CHARGE CARD broke slowly and was always outrun. COMBAT CONTROLLER bobbled breaking
inward with the rider off balance and briefly losing the left iron, and never got close.

wide to upper stretch, vied between rivals in the lane, switched back to the left lead late and outfinished a pace rival for the place. SOLDOLLIE dueled two
wide early, edged ahead in upper stretch, led to deep stretch but was outfinished late. DAD'S YANKEES vied inside of rivals early, chased inside around the
turn and lacked a closing bid. SILVER DEFENSE went evenly three wide. AEQUOR played no factor while racing three wide. I'M CARDINAL had early
speed inside, dropped back entering the turn, angled four wide early on the bend, chased outside and came up empty in the lane. REAGAN'S HEART hit

COMPETITIVE SPEED pressed the early pace outside LIFECHANGINGEVENT, took over approaching the stretch and drove clear. PRETTY RACHEL was
never far back, came three wide into the lane and finished well. LIFECHANGINGEVENT set the pace slightly removed from the rail, could not fend off the
winner turning for home, and weakened on her left lead. QUIET STRENGTH was outrun early, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and improved
position without threatening. STARSHIP NEBULA stayed in range early, and tired inside through the lane. D ORO GIRL saved ground to no avail. TOO
BLESSED was always outrun. DAWNSWEETSMILE retreated around the turn inside.

the start, advanced inside around the turn and through upper stretch, was unable to match strides with the winner when that one straightened out in
midstretch and just lasted for the place. CAPITAN FOFO raced off the pace four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, rallied widest and just missed
second. AIN'T WASTING TIME went two wide off the pace and rallied belatedly between foes. BABY BROTHER was bumped after the start, chased the
winner three wide and faded in the lane. IT'S A RISK steadied at the start, raced well back two wide and passed tiring rivals. SHANGHAI LEVI played no
factor while racing two wide. DIAMONDS ENJOY was outrun while racing three wide. WITH A BIT OF LUCK chased the pace inside and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
JUST KIDDING sprinted clear early, rated along near the two-path through an even clip for six furlongs, and remained in command under a drive. FIRST
AND THREE was unhurried early, saved ground taking closer order into the stretch, and rallied on the rail without seriously menacing the top one.
INGREIDO saved ground forwardly placed early, raced two then three wide around the far turn, and finished willingly to clearly best the remainder. GREEN
MANSIONS raced three wide much of the way, and lacked the needed bid. CHARLIE THE GREEK raced four wide, and tired after six furlongs. NO
GETTING OVER ME raced three wide, and tired before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
OUR FANTASY broke inward and brushed GREATER PLAN at the start, made progress two wide around the first turn, split rivals nearing the half-mile pole,
seized command at that marker, quickly drew off inside around the far turn, continued on the left lead to deep stretch and held well clear under a drive.
GREATER PLAN vied along rail, tipped out entering the far turn to chase the winner two wide, never threatened that foe but stayed on well to be well clear
of the rest. GLORIOUS GAL hit the starting gate, was in tight between rivals around the first turn, angled in late on the bend, advanced inside down the
backstretch, could not keep pace while still saving ground around the far turn but was along for the show. ALL ABOUT KATHERN was bumped after the
start, pressed the pace three wide and faded after a half. LA RUSIA bobbled at the start, vied two wide for a half then dropped back. LAKE PARIMA raced
three wide around the first turn, saved ground rounding the far turn and never threatened. SHE FLED THE SCENE was bumped after the start, raced three
wide and played no factor. PUFFER FISH was bumped after the start, raced four wide and was through early.

Footnotes
JACK B WINKLE advanced three wide on the far turn, caught ELITE MISSION from outside coming to the eighth-pole and drew away under a drive.
SUPER EDGAR bumped with POWER at the start, entered the first turn five wide, moved in through the middle stages, and rallied in the two-path to go
clear of the rest. POWER (BRZ) bumped with SUPER EDGAR at the start, settled in midpack for six furlongs, and had a mild late response. ELITE
MISSION moved clear up the backstretch, repelled a challenge from REVOLVING STAR leaving the quarter-pole, could not stave off the winner after
straightening away for the drive, and faded late on the rail. YES FOR LESS saved ground outrun to the stretch, and passed tired horses.
NINETYDAYSOFWINTER was four wide early, and posed no threat. REVOLVING STAR led early before relinquishing command to ELITE MISSION, rebid
outside that rival on the far turn, then gave way through upper stretch. SLIPPY was five or six wide coming off the first turn, and tired before reaching the
stretch. GLOBAL DINNER raced three to four wide, and was finished early. MIGHTY FAST was forwardly placed early near the three-path, and faltered
through the lane. DR. SAMADI was far back throughout. ALL STAR SEILER saved ground outrun to the lane, and dropped far back.
