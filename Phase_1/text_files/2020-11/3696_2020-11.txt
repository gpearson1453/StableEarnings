Footnotes
TRIBAL NOTION wasn't far back while four wide into the turn, opened a short lead entering the stretch and held stubbornly after a stiff drive. AMERICAN
CHESTNUT opened a clear lead along the inside before going a quarter, responded gamely when challenged entering the stretch and continued with good
courage. MEMORY BOUQUET was slow early, made a strong four wide run around the turn then flattened out. MIDDLE EARTH was slow early, raced the
five path around the turn and gained late outside. SHEPHERD'S WILL ducked in sharply leaving the gate, advanced inside early then weakened.
BERMONDSEY pressed the early leader into the turn then faded two wide. SUMMERFEST advanced between horses early, remained in good position to
the stretch then tired. IRON CLASH had to be reloaded prior to the start, advanced between horses early then stopped. NOTORIOUS REY was forced in
leaving the gate then couldn't catch up.

entering the turn, came out wide midway on the bend and made up ground too late. NASHVEGAS wasn't far back five wide around the turn then tired.

PREMIUM MOTION was slow early, raced three wide around the turn, split horses through the stretch and was along in time. VANESSA'S SECRET
showed speed outside, moved two wide to command midway on the turn, remained clear into the final sixteenth then gave way late. SNOW BLOSSOM had
position inside early, came out into the three path on the turn and lacked the needed closing response. SUNSHINE BAY angled to the inside with the early
lead and tired in the lane. RAISETONEW HEIGHTS stayed inside in an even effort. EYE OF THE WILDCAT bumped with GIULIANA VEE leaving the gate,
lagged badly then found best stride too late. SECUENCIA chased early then tired. GIULIANA VEE was outrun. YOUARESTILLTHEWON was finished early.

ITSKNOWNASTHEBERN cleared soon after the break, stayed out from the rail and held under urging. DUE GEMELLI was slow early, made a two wide run
into the stretch then continued evenly. BILETNIKOFF stayed inside and passed tired ones. SEVILLIAN broke slowly, lagged early then found best stride too
late. FINE N DANDY was caught wide around the fist turn, made a three wide run into the far turn to vie then flattened out. SLY WILDCAT was no factor.
NO SENSE chased the winner for about three-quarters then stopped. JUST KITTEN YOU stopped.
