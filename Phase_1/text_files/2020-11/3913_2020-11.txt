Footnotes
CAMPAIGN SPY, urged to terms with the first flight stalking just off those rivals under light rating to the backstretch, was urged to press the issue racing into
the far turn, gained even terms entering the lane and narrowly prevailed under firm left handed pressure while exchanging some light contact late. JACK B
WINKLE was urged to join a rival on the lead prompting the pace, angled inwards once gaining the advantage racing into the backstretch to set the pace on
a narrow margin, dueled for command through the stretch and grudgingly resisted to the end to just miss. MAYRHOFEN, jostled at the start, settled outside
a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled inside nearing the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position
while prevailing for a share. PURCHASING POWER tracked off the first flight along the inside, switched out to gain some position between foes racing into
upper stretch but had no final kick. CPL. DIONICIO broke readily, disputed the pace along the inside to the backstretch, then gave way racing into the far
turn. SECRET LIFE STYLE broke out bumping a rival, was collected to track the leaders outside a rival in second flight, continued three deep into the
second bend and faded into the stretch. SWINGSTAGE settled along the inside and dropped out early. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
R AVERIE LYNN broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn, then kicked clear racing through the stretch
under steady pressure. MELANCHOLY BLUES angled inwards to prompt the pacesetter through the backstretch into the lane but proved no match late.
BABY BEE MERRY angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing to the turn, shifted three wide entering the lane but lacked the needed final kick
while prevailing for a share. MAGESTAL BASTIDA tracked off the second flight four wide through the backstretch and continued evenly in that path to late
stages. RUBY LEE switched off the inside early tracking just off the second flight between foes but lacked a closing response. ABSORBED settled inside
foes early and proved no threat. C'EST PARTI settled outside foes in the last flight and never menaced. MAY BEAU proved no factor.

HANDSOME EFFORT was rated off the second flight near the inside racing to the first turn, shifted out entering the backstretch to track three deep between
foes, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and produced a sustained response to reel in TOP BOMB at the wire under firm handling. The latter
gained a forward placing attending the pace in the opening half, pressed the issue nearing the lane, then went clear racing through upper stretch but just
failed to contain the winner. RAL COBRA CREEK hopped at the start losing position to the field, recovered quickly to gain a position being rated just off the
first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted three wide racing into the lane while being prompted to advance and continued willingly to the end
while just outkicked by the top pair. OUR GREY GHOST broke a bit awkwardly, settled last along the inside to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing
into the lane and continued willingly to close the gap to the end. HIGHLY NOTED, urged to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a
narrow margin to the far turn, then weakened inside foes in the drive. FLIPPING FUN was rated along the inside as part of the second flight racing to the far
turn, shifted out entering the lane but steadily faded in late stages. DELFT BLUE tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, raced four
wide into upper stretch but had no rally. BRO GUN, caught five wide racing to the first turn, proved no threat. TESTIFIED was a brief factor between foes
just off the second flight, shifted to the inside and steadily faded after a half.

Footnotes
PERFETTO, forwardly placed three wide attending the pace through the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes in that path racing into upper stretch
and edged forward to a clear advantage late under firm encouragement. RIDE INTO THE SKY, urged prompting a rival's pace in the opening stages,
pressed the issue between foes to midstretch but proved no match for the winner late. COMBAT CONTROLLER, urged along the inside disputing the pace
from the outset into the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch and yielded late. TALE OF A SONG broke readily, tracked the leaders outside foes in
second flight, was urged to challenge four wide racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. MULLED WINE, caught widest early, settled
outside foes, angled inwards racing into the turn and improved position three deep between foes in the closing stages. NO CHOICE tracked off the first flight
between foes racing into the turn and faded into upper stretch. IBERICO stumbled at the start, exchanged bumps, was collected to track off the second
flight, was prompted to advance while fanned five wide racing into the lane and lacked a closing response. KING DUDE OF OCALA angled to the inside
early tracking just off the first flight, saved ground to upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. MR WRENCH IT, bumped at the start, never gained
contention. SUNSHINE CHARLIE bobbled at the start while breaking a bit slowly, was urged inside foes in brief pursuit of the leaders but emptied out early.
CHARGE CARD broke awkwardly and failed to menace thereafter. WILD WIGGLIN JACK dropped out early.

Footnotes
THREEOHTWOCASSIE angled inwards to gain a forward placing between foes racing to the first turn, conceded ground to the pacesetter leading the
second flight into the backstretch, steadily gained terms with the leader advancing in tandem with D'CRAZINESS nearing upper stretch to bid for command
three wide, drifted to the four path racing through the stretch but went clear late under firm encouragement. CAN'T TRUMP KITTEN, reserved off the
second flight between foes early, switched outside foes on the backstretch, steadily gained position racing four wide into upper stretch and proved best of
the others. D'CRAZINESS tracked the leader three deep as part of the second flight, angled inwards racing into the far turn to bid for command between
foes in tandem with the eventual winner but couldn't match that rival's kick. MY COWBOY angled inwards while being urged to dispute the lead racing into
the first turn, went clear into the backstretch, set the pace to the far turn but emptied out racing through the stretch. FADE AWAY tracked off the second
flight outside foes, angled inwards racing into the stretch and gained some position while caught in close quarters late. UNLOCKTHEPOTENTIAL, reserved
outside foes in the last flight early, passed tiring rivals racing four wide into the stretch. AFTERBURNER tracked off the second flight along the inside to the
backstretch but offered no rally. PRAETORIAN tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight and steadily faded nearing the lane. IMPERIAL BREW,
reserved inside foes in early stages, never seriously menaced. KITTEN STREET made brief pursuit of the pacesetter along the inside into the first turn,
retreated steadily after a half, was pulled up in the stretch but walked off the course under his own power. THE RIDER OF D'CRAZINESS LODGED A
CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
FIRST DEGREE was settled off the second flight outside foes racing through the backstretch, advanced four wide racing through the turn, was fanned to the
six path entering the lane but continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm encouragement. FELON angled inwards in the
opening stages while being urged in pursuit of the pacesetter in the opening quarter, wrested the advantage from that foe nearing the turn, dictated the pace
through the bend to upper stretch while shifting to the three path, resisted the winner's bid but came up second best. STORM RISK tracked the leaders four
wide as part of the second flight, continued three deep into the bend, shifted to the five path to bid between foes in upper stretch but couldn't match terms
with the top pair late. HE HAD A SECRET ducked outwards at the start, then was held up in the opening stages, switched outside foes on the backstretch,
was prompted to advance racing five deep on the turn, angled inwards nearing the lane to split foes just off the inside and gained some position while
lacking the needed final kick. WICKED STRONG ALEX tracked off the second flight three wide between foes racing to the turn and continued evenly in that
path to gain some position while making no real impression. NICE OF ME tracked off the second flight between foes just off the inside racing into the turn
and continued evenly late. AWESOME ENOUGH, urged to a forward placing three deep racing just off the leaders to the turn, emptied out nearing the lane.
LOGSDON was hustled to the lead while angling sharply to the inside in the opening furlong but was spent early. WHISKEY BENT, bobbled, then was
bumped at the start and never menaced thereafter. ACASEADAY, urged to position between foes in the second flight in the opening quarter, retreated early.
SEATTLE COUNCIL broke out bumping WHISKEY BENT at the start, was urged along the rail racing behind the second flight to the turn but emptied out
early. RARERARE proved no factor.

Footnotes
CATSOUTOFTHEBAG, urged to gain a position between foes in the second flight tracking just off the pacesetter, was urged to challenge racing into upper
stretch, steadied momentarily avoiding a loose rival nearing the furlong marker but was righted in time to edge MY SISTER'S KEEPER in time under firm
encouragement. The latter tracked just off the pacesetter inside foes as part of the second flight racing into the turn, shifted out to bid for command in close
quarters just off the inside in upper stretch, steadied in traffic nearing the furlong marker, then gained a brief advantage between calls but couldn't contain
the winner. MAGIC HATTER settled last dropping well off the field, angled five wide nearing midstretch and found his best stride late to prevail for a share.
BUSTIN HEARTS angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing into the turn, then shifted four wide nearing midstretch to gain some position
between foes. SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT broke slowly, was prompted to gain contention near the inside approaching the turn, steadied in some traffic entering
the bend, saved ground on the turn, then continued evenly near the inside in the closing stages. PRINCESS LIVIA tracked off the second flight four wide
racing to the turn, was held up momentarily nearing the quarter mile marker to avoid a loose rival and had no late response. LAKOTA PRINCESS, urged to
position three deep in second flight tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the bend, was taken up avoiding tight quarters when crowded by a loose foe
racing into upper stretch and quickly emptied out. KANFU tracked off the second flight outside foes to the turn but dropped back early. WILD EMBRACE
broke sharply, set the pace on a narrow margin along the inside racing into the turn, gave out midstretch, then was checked out of traffic leaving the furlong
marker. SETHAMEE STREET stumbled at the start dislodging her rider, but walked off the course under her own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND STRETCH RUN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

HIGH FIVE COTTON broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the rail racing to the turn, shifted to the three path entering the
lane and turned back several challengers to gain a clear advantage nearing the wire under firm right handed encouragement. EXPENSIVE STYLE, in touch
with the pacesetter three wide between foes stalking the pace, advanced to press the issue between rivals racing into upper stretch but proved only second
best. TUNE IN, forwardly placed four wide tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, was urged to challenge in that path racing into upper stretch but
was outkicked by the top pair. CAROUSE tracked off the first flight racing in the three path into the turn, angled inside the leaders racing into upper stretch
while being roused to advance but had no closing bid. EXCHEQUER, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, faded
after a half. WHISKEY DASH, off a step slowly, was urged inside prompting the leader through the backstretch but gave way early.

Footnotes
SKOL CHANT was rated three deep in the opening stages tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued in that
path to upper stretch and made steady progress in the closing stages to just edge LAKE PARIMA in time under firm left handed encouragement. The latter
was urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second bend, shifted out while being
roused to turn back rivals racing through the stretch, resisted the winner to the end but came up second best. SPLENDOR BEACH, firmly rated in close
quarters along the inside racing to the first turn, shifted out to track just off the pacesetter between foes after a half, was held up avoiding close quarters
conceding some position racing into the far turn, angled four wide racing through the stretch but continued with interest to narrowly prevail for a share.
KELCIE'S MANDATE tracked off the second flight between foes early, angled to the inside after a half to track just off the pacesetter along the inside, saved
ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. MI KARLITA settled last to the backstretch, angled inside entering the stretch and made some
belated progress. MAGDALENA tracked off the second flight along the inside to the far turn, shifted out racing through the lane but had no rally. MAHKATO,
pulling between foes racing to the first turn, moved to a forward placing prompting the pacesetter into the backstretch, continued between foes to the far turn
and gave way. DONNAMEUP settled along the inside in early stages, switched out entering the backstretch, was caught four wide racing through the far
turn and proved no threat. WONDER BLONDY settled off the second flight outside foes racing to the backstretch and offered no rally.
