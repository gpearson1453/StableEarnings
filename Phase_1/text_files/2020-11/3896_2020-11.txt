DEB'S ALL OUT trailed down the backstretch, circled her field rapidly on the turn, made the lead nearing the top of the stretch and won under brisk
handling. DANCING GRACE stalked the pace into the turn, moved closer in the three path entering the stretch, drifted to the five path and was steadily
gaining on the winner in the final stages. JUDGE REESE allowed to settle, passed tiring rivals through the stretch in the five path. CAUSE OF LOVE failed
to menace. LOOSE IN PARADISE was no factor. HOOS TAKING CHARGE made the lead soon after the start, set the pace to the quarter pole then
weakened. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE was through after a half. JOHNS LOVELY LADY chased the pace into the turn then flattened out. MIZZEN SPOILS had
speed into the turn then stopped.

B DUBYA trailed into the stretch, shifted out past the middle of the racetrack, closed with a burst of speed to make the lead late and dew clear. SAY HEY
KID never far back, advanced steadily in a long drive six wide and got up for second. DOROTHYS BOY away alertly, set the pace into the stretch, drifted
out to the eight path and was outfinished in the final stages. TONEDADDY never far back, finished well in the middle of the racetrack.
UNTILWEMEETAGAIN stalked the early pace, loomed boldly four wide before a half, remained a sharp threat into the stretch and leveled off. TEAM RIBOT
pressed the pace two wide, dropped inside after a half then faded late. TRAVEL WEST pressed the pace three then two wide into the stretch and weakened
in the final furlong. FATHER DENNIS unhurried, improved inside through mid stretch then failed to sustain that bid. WHAT'S ON TAP stalked the pace from
the inside into the far turn then gave way.

Footnotes
VERTICAL THREAT was hustled from the gate to make the lead along the inside soon after the start, set all the pace and widened through the stretch to
win as much the best while taken in hand late. WILLISTON WAY broke in front, chased the winner the balance of the trip and gamely gained second in the
four path. FLATTER ME PLEASE stalked the pace form the inside and finished with good courage. NIGHT TIME went evenly. RELENTLESS DANCER
failed to menace. CHIEF RANDEL was no factor. TRY TRY AGAIN trailed into the turn then passed tiring rivals in the stretch. JAMAICAN MAGIC reluctant
to load, was outrun. DARK OAK was no threat. NANO had speed into the turn then gave way. SCARED WARIOR had brief speed. FORE LEFT was in tight
leaving the chute and had failed to reach contention.
