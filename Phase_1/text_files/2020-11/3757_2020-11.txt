Footnotes
HIGHEST PRAISE bobbled at the start, moved up closer into the turn when in the two path, bid into the lane two wide, dueled with the pacesetter through
the lane and inched up late. NO MAS set the pace into the turn while under pressure from outside rival, was joined soon after by another along the inside,
repelled those two in late turn, was joined by the eventual winner at the top of the lane, dueled with that one through the final eighth and was denied.
CAPTAIN BILLY ROY moved up along the rail into the turn to put pressure on the pacesetter, continued in close proximity into late turn, shifted from the
inside into the four path entering the lane then lacked a closing response. EAGLE KEEPER raced in the four path through the turn when close up early then
lacked a bid. AMIGO MIKE pressed the pace early while three wide, chased along through the turn then faded. AURORA PINE was outrun while in the two
path.

Footnotes
ROOSTER was away alertly to gain the lead at once, widened into the turn, maintained the lead to the eighth pole and was under intermittent urging to hold
clear. RUSHED chased the winner from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane while nearest the winner, continued under a drive through the final
furlong and could not make up ground while clearly second best. PINER CAT chased the pace from the four path through the turn and into the lane and
finished evenly. CJ'S BILLY'SEMPIRE was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and moved up. HUCKLEBERRY HILL
pressed the pace from the two path into the turn then steadily weakened. WICKED SLIDER was in the four path through the turn and lacked a response.
DARKNSTORMYTIME was never a factor along the inside. EASY DOER was outrun while in the two path.

Footnotes
CHARLES CHROME settled behind the dueling early speed into the turn while close to the inside, gained momentum and came off the rail after mid-turn,
angled four wide into the lane when with energy and finished with determination to edge clear inside the sixteenth pole. LOOKIN FOR LOKI chased the
pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane, gained a short lead with a furlong to go but was outfinished by the top one inside the eighth pole.
MISCHIEVIOUSBUD set the pace while under pressure from several others into the turn, continued to be on top into the lane, dueled with the runner-up into
the eighth pole then yielded. SATURDAY NIGHT was steadied into the turn when close up, raced along the rail into the lane and never was a serious threat.
YES SIR ROBERT was near the inside through the turn, angled into the six path into the lane and moved up while not a menace. PETIT VERDOT pressed
the pace four wide into the turn then steadily faded. EDGE TO EDGE chased the pace from the three path through the turn then faded in the lane.
FITZPATRICK was along the inside through the turn, angled into the lane from the ten path and never was a threat. ALGEBRAIC raced in the four or five
path into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
DIRECT APPROACH was in the three path while never far back, bid into the lane, was three wide near the three-sixteenths pole, came to near even terms
just inside the eighth pole, dueled with the leader to the wire and just inched up. TOP CREDENTIALS set the pace while under pressure by several others,
repelled a rival into the far turn, was joined by another, shook that one off in late turn, was joined from the inside by another while straightening in the lane,
repelled that one while being joined by the eventual winner, dueled with that one to the wire and just could not hold sway in a game effort. GOOD GOOD
inside trip, cut corner and bid entering the lane from along the rail, appeared to be a serious threat after straightening then could not keep up with the top
two. A KING'S RANSOM pressed the pace into the far turn while along the inside, was passed by several while still along the inside, steadied near the
quarter pole, shifted into the four path entering the lane and passed a couple tired ones. TWIN FARMS moved up down the backstretch from the four path to
gain a contending position, continued in the four path through the turn and tired after entering the lane. RUNMALIBURUN was never a factor while trailing
into the lane from the two path. CONFIDENTIAL was in the four path through the first turn, pressed the pace three wide into the far turn then was empty
turning into the lane.

Footnotes
RESERVE LIST was in the three path through the turn when never too far back, swung into the lane from the three or four path, gained momentum when
straightening then commenced a long drive and just got up at the wire. OOOH BARRACUDA pressed the early pace then settled back through the turn
while saving ground, cut the corner into the lane, got through near the sixteenth pole, led late then was nailed at the wire. SHOW ME THE BEST chased the
pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane, gained a short lead with an eighth to go then could not keep up with the top two late. MAJESTIC
ICE was along the inside through the turn, came off the rail entering the lane and was well placed with an eighth to go then could not gain further while
moving up a spot. MISS MESS was last away and was moving up approaching the far turn, was checked sharply nearing the three-eighths pole, dropped
back several lengths, was ridden again through the turn from the three path, entered the lane from the eight path and was never a serious threat late. SOFT
N LOVELY set the pace into the lane while in the two path then gave way after the eighth pole. MO CLARE'S was never a serious threat while in the four to
the three path through the turn and the ten path through the lane. BOO'S GAL never a factor while in the two path. EGALITE was in the four path through
the turn, came into the lane from the nine path and was never a menace. TURQUOISE TRAIL was in the three path through the turn when never far back
and was done at the eighth pole. TOURIST LIKE ME was outrun while along the inside.

Footnotes
SNIPER KITTEN chased the early pace, bid three wide at the three-eighths pole to take first aim at the loose leader, collared that one, drew off in the stretch
and was kept to task. STRONG TIDE raced in the four path, bid five wide in early stretch but couldn't get to the winner. J W RUCKUS stalked inside, bid at
the quarter pole, then faltered. MY BARILEY raced inside and had a mild late bid outside. KREWE CHIEF saved ground. CAN'TBETEMALL was unrushed
early, bid at the half mile, then faltered in the drive. MR. GARY D stalked in the three path, bid at the three-eighths pole, then was checked at the quarter
pole when lacking room. SHAKES CREEK was jostled at the start, went off clear, then couldn't last. EAST LEX was not a factor. The Stewards disallowed
an objection by the rider of MR. GARY D alleging interference by CAN'TBETEMALL near the quarter pole.
