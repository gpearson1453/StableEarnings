Footnotes
COLT FICTION bumped rival at the start, prompted the pace from outside, took over past the five-sixteenths pole, cleared into the stretch and drew off
under hand urging. ZORICH bumped at the start, floated out by BAM BAM AGAIN early, took the turn four wide, rallied and earned the place. FLAT WHITE
chased three deep then three wide into the stretch and finished evenly. BAM BAM AGAIN bumped at the start, lacked early speed and angled off the rail
early, moved back into the two path nearing the turn, swung out into the stretch and kept on for a minor award. GATE SPEED dueled briefly then inched
ahead to set a pressured pace, lost command past the five-sixteenths pole, chased the winner into the stretch while a bit off the rail and tired.
HOLLYWOOD'S BEST bumped leaving the gate, stalked the pace inside a pair of rivals, saved ground into the stretch and weakened. LEPRINO chased the
top pair from between rivals, two wide into the lane and came up empty.

HIMIKO showed early speed, dueled with A MELIS in the two path through the turn, kicked clear at the top of the lane and drew away under a few taps of
right-handed urging. A MELIS set the pace outside a pair of rivals then dueled with HIMIKO three wide around the turn and proved no match for the winner
in the lane. PROVOCATION mid-pack early on, raced outside a rival then three to four wide around the turn and never produced a bid.
ANDYOUSHALLRECEIVE traveled off the rail, went four wide through the turn, came out at the top of the lane and never rallied. RATHER NOSY chased
the pace from inside, two wide into the stretch and weakened. MISS ALEGRIA climbed early then settled into stride along the inside, came off the turn two

MUCHA WOMAN set the pace early, padded the lead around the far turn, shortened a bit late but was able to hold on. MY PRINCESS ELLIE trailed the
field off the inside, went four then three wide around the far turn, rallied but was too late. DANCING DANA stumbled leaving the gate, raced four wide
through the clubhouse turn, remained off the rail up the backstretch, traveled three then two wide on the second turn, tipped out a bit in the lane and finished
evenly. BIG MAMA SUE unhurried in the beginning and tucked inside, coaxed along at the half-mile mark, lacked room inside at the three-eighths pole,
stayed along the fence to the stretch and tired. MALIBU MISTRESS stumbled a bit at the start but recovered well, chased off the rail, three then two wide on
the far turn and weakened. EXCHANGE VOWS raced three wide into the first turn then angled to the fenced around the bend, stalked a bit off the rail,
angled in around the far turn while ridden along but tired in the drive. SMOOTH RITHMS tracked off the rail, dropped back into the far turn, eased exiting
that bend, coasted to the finish line and walked off.

SAVILE ROW pressed the leader from outside, headed rival at the five-sixteenths pole, dueled into the stretch, took over and moved clear at the eighth
pole, then held strongly under a drive. AFFABLE stalked off the rail, between rivals into the turn, raced outside a foe or two wide into the stretch, finished
willingly and gained the place. STAR SAILOR unhurried in the early going, advanced four then three wide around the turn, then went evenly through the
final furlong. BARRAZA settled along the inside, saved ground around the turn, lacked room in the pocket from the three-sixteenths pole to the eighth pole,
tipped out in the furlong grounds and lacked a rally. NO PEDIGREE set the pace with company to the outside, dueled around the turn and into the stretch,
lost command at the top of the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
PALADAR broke out and bumped rival, sprinted clear and showed the way early, remained clear off the rail into the stretch and widened under mild asking.
RONAMO broke in and bumped rival, went five wide into the first turn then moved into the four path, advanced four wide on the second turn then angled in a
path, chased the winner through the lane and while unable to summon the needed rally was clearly second best. POLAR WIND stalked from inside then
moved out into the two path, brushed with rival into the far turn, bumped with that rival at the five-sixteenths pole, saved ground into the stretch and held off
rival for the show. SIGNOFTHECROSS bumped leaving the gate, chased off the rail then between rivals, brushed with foe into the far turn, bumped with
rival again at the five-sixteenths pole, kept on in the lane and missed the show. CLAIM OF PASSION bumped start, went four wide into the stretch and
lacked a rally. SYNTHESIS stumbled at the start, pulled leaving the first turn and into the backstretch, traveled three wide into the far turn then angled five
wide exiting and proved no menace. MONGOLIAN LEGEND broke in and bumped rival, reserved from inside early, took closer order leaving the
backstretch, checked near the seven-sixteenths pole, moved out into the two path around the turn and had little left for the drive.

MICHALSKA chased off the rail, rallied three then four wide on the turn, gained command at the top of the lane and drew off. ENSLEYS DREAM broke out
and bumped twice, raced two then three wide around the turn and edged rival for the place. PRAY FOR MY OWNER broke in and bumped rival, dueled
from inside into and around the bend, lost command at the top of the stretch, then flattened in deep stretch and lost the place. GREAT CURVES bumped
both sides at the start, chased between foes at the seven-sixteenths pole, steadied at the three-eighths, angled to the inside and improved position in the
drive. OUR MISS MILLIE off slow to begin, dropped back early, raced well off the rail to the turn, came five wide into the stretch and showed a mild
response to improved position. STREAMING TIGER pinballed leaving the gate, chased the pace from inside then angled out into the stretch and weakened.
ALLIE'S PAL broke in, dueled for the lead outside a rival to the stretch and folded. WHOSMILINGNOW tossed head and broke out, went five wide into the
lane and lacked further response. MENSA ON TAP stumbled a bit at the start and broke out, traveled four then three wide around the turn and was never a
factor.

MO SEE CAL stalked off the inside, closed in outside the leader around the turn, took over approaching the quarter pole, kicked clear and drew off in the
lane. WARREN'S SHOWTIME tracked off the rail, steadied off heels around the turn, angled outside rival and came three wide into the stretch, moved out
further in the lane and bested the rest. JUST GRAZED ME tracked outside a rival early, chased three wide into the lane and got edged for the place.
SMILING SHIRLEE unhurried up the backstretch, exited the turn four wide and finished evenly for a minor award. NARDINI bumped leaving the gate, raced
near the inside then two wide into the stretch and kept on through the final furlong. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL stumbled leaving the gate, settled inside early,
saved ground then came out into the stretch and was never a factor. MISS MEGAN controlled the pace up the backstretch, lost command nearing the
quarter pole, chased along the rail into the lane and tired. HOTITUDE broke in and bumped rival at the start, up close early, lost ground around the turn and

Footnotes
INDEPENDENCE HALL broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, stalked outside a foe up the backstretch, entered the turn five wide and angled into the
three path around the turn, closed in alongside the runner-up inside the eighth pole and drew clear late. P R RADIO STAR forwardly placed early on from off
the rail, bid outside the leader at the quarter pole, took command near the eighth pole, could not match the winner in deep stretch but held the place.
PYRON traveled near the back of the field, went four wide around the turn, summoned a late bid but could not get up for second. MANHATTAN UP knocked
into rival at the start, trailed the field early, came off the turn five wide and showed late effort in the final furlong. ANYPORTINASTORM set the pace outside
a rival then cleared inside rival, challenged at the quarter pole and fought back from inside then weakened in the final furlong. SPARKY VILLE hopped and
hit the outside part of the gate, traveled two wide into the turn then angled to the rail around the bend, asked and never responded. GRIT AND CURIOSITY
bumped hard at the start, in range early off the rail, entered the turn four wide then moved down into the three path and lacked a rally. HE'S THE REASON
prompted the pace early from inside, could not keep up nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, lost ground around the turn, came out into the stretch and tired.
