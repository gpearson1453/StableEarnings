Footnotes
RICHIES GREAT GIRL was bumped by GUEST IN MY HEART in the opening strides, tracked the leading trio inside of BELLE BREZING, was driven along
the rail into the lane, taken between horses to midstretch to continue her rally, led with a sixteenth remaining and held. BELLE BREZING tracked the leading
trio two wide, swung four wide into the lane, rallied, but missed while still four wide. WILLOW MOON disputed the early pace outside of SISTER RULER,
cleared in the three path on the turn, led to the sixteenth until being headed by RICHIES GREAT GIRL, and kept on willingly after being passed. OOPSY
DAISY settled toward the rear inside of CHROME ATTACK early, raced toward the rear in the two path on the turn, was driven four wide in upper stretch,
and rallied four to five wide. CHROME ATTACK chased two wide early, continued midfield in the two path on the turn, was driven between horses from
upper stretch, took closer order in the lane but ultimately was outkicked. GUEST IN MY HEART broke in and bumped RICHIES GREAT GIRL in the opening
strides, settled second last, raced in the three path on the turn, came three wide into upper stretch, angled further out near the three sixteenths, and made
belated six wide improvement. SISTER RULER disputed the pace inside of WILLOW MOON early, tracked that foe around the turn while racing in the two to
three path, dropped to the inside in upper stretch and made a bid, but weakened in the final furlong. SUPERSTAR BEA was bumped by RICHIES GREAT
GIRL in the opening strides after GUEST IN MY HEART bumped that one, settled at the rear, saved ground through the turn and into the lane, and
mustered no rally. LAPIS STORM tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, came three wide into upper stretch, and
faded.

Footnotes
SCARLET POSITION led the field under a hold up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off in the final
quarter of a mile under a drive. SHOWIT stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, angled out to the three path around the turn, launched a bid
approaching the quarter pole, and gained ground mildly on the outside in the stretch, the best of the rest. IMA LITTLE KITTEN trailed the field on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and gained some ground in late stretch while never threatening the top two.
FIANNA HILLS brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, chased the leader on the outside early, moved up to challenge from the two path
nearing the three eighths pole and faded in the stretch. CHAMPAGNERIE raced inside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, saved ground around
the turn and weakened in the final furlong. NO CACHA NA (CHI) raced outside off the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and
offered no bid in the stretch.

wide into the lane, rallied, and missed the place. THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN settled inside near the rear, took closer order past the nine sixteenths, saved
ground through the turn, was driven inside into the lane, rallied in upper stretch but was outfinished late. NORCO chased two wide, was shuffled back into
the far turn, raced in the three path between horses on the far turn and taken four wide into the lane, and kept on mildly outside. CROW MOON raced three
wide in the leading flight early, edged to the lead past the three quarters, set the pace until being confronted by HALF OF MANHATTAN near the five
sixteenths, vied from there to the furlong mark, and flattened out inside. HE'S DANN GOOD was hard to settle early, raced at the rear, pulled closer past the
five eighths, chased three wide through the far turn and into the lane, and flattened in the final furlong. CONTRACTION was sent for speed inside, disputed
the pace through the opening quarter, tracked between horses down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, and weakened between horses in the

Footnotes
FORT RAMSEY bobbled slightly leaving the gate, pressed the pace from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up to challenge
nearing the half mile pole, took command from the two path passing the three eighths pole and held his lead to the wire. SERTOMAN saved ground around
the first turn, settled behind the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, made a mild rally between horses in the
stretch, and came up short. PRINCE ARLO raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated
the far turn from the two path and gained some ground on the outside in the final furlong. FORT RIDGE raced in the four path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid from the three path nearing the quarter pole and was outkicked while
drifting out slightly in the stretch. DIAMOND DAVE trailed the field from the two path through the opening half mile, saved ground around the far turn, swung
out entering the stretch and passed tiring horses on the outside in the final furlong. BAHNKE raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch off the pace on the inside, saved ground around the second turn and came up empty in the stretch. WORKINGFORALIVING led the field on the
rail around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the turn, began to tire nearing the quarter pole and continued to weaken in
the stretch.

SOMEONE SAID SO tracked the leading pair early inside of MAUREENLOVESFRANK, raced in the two path behind the leading flight on the turn, went to a
drive inside in upper stretch, rallied, led past the furlong mark and drove clear. PERFECTIONTODETAIL broke sharply, vied outside of LEN'S GOLD early,
set a pressured pace between horses on the turn as MAUREENLOVESFRANK loomed, shook that foe off into the lane, was headed by SOMEONE SAID
SO past the furlong mark and kept on on second best. MORRIE'S JOY settled near the rear inside of CREAL SUGAR, chased in the three path on the turn,
was driven five wide into the lane, and rallied with good interest for the show. MAUREENLOVESFRANK broke inward and bumped AMERICAN EMPRESS
in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair between horses early, bid three wide into the turn, loomed to the quarter pole, was turned back by
PERFECTIONTODETAIL into the lane, and flattened out. CREAL SUGAR broke out and bumped AMERICAN EMPRESS in the opening strides, settled
near the rear outside of MORRIE'S JOY, continued toward the rear in the three path on the turn, and improved mildly past tiring horses in the lane.
DOROTA chased five wide just behind the second flight on the backstretch, chased four wide on the turn, and had no rally in the lane. AMERICAN
EMPRESS was jostled between horses in the opening jumps and came awkwardly into stride, settled at the rear, was urged in the three to four path on the
second, and made no bid. LEN'S GOLD vied inside of PERFECTIONTODETAIL to the three eighths and then emptied out.

GOLDEN LILY raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace up the backstretch, began to move up from the three path around the far turn
and continued to gain through the stretch to get up for the win in the final strides. PLACATI opened up a lead from the three path around the first turn,
continued to show the way under a hold up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and raced gamely down the lane, getting caught in the final
strides. MAGNITUDE TEN saved ground around the first turn, raced on the inside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, came around the far turn in
the two path, swung wide entering the stretch and finished evenly. BIG LUCK saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and swung out to gain ground on the outside in late stretch. VEGAS VIXEN saved ground around
the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the path and faded in the stretch. BROADWAY DUCHESS
trailed the field from the two path through the opening half mile, saved ground around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch while never truly
threatening. IRISH HALO raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, navigated the far turn from the
two path and offered no bid. MELISSANI raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch between horses, moved in to save ground
around the far turn and tired in the final furlong. COCOA PEACH veered out slightly leaving the gate, raced in the four path around the first turn, continued
up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began to tire while racing in the three path around the far turn and was never a factor from there.

Footnotes
ARCH FLYER was sent for pace inside, set the pace down the backstretch and while saving ground on the turn, was urged inside in upper stretch, and
stubbornly held sway. STORMY EMPIRE came in slightly in the opening strides, chased four wide down the backstretch, was pushed along into the turn,
tracked the leading trio two wide around the bend, turned for home between horses, went to a drive behind the leading flight in upper stretch, was taken
outside them near the three sixteenths, and gained well late. WINNING QUALITY chased three wide down the backstretch, dropped in to save ground
midfield on the turn, raced at the inside of the chasing group into the lane, was driven to improve inside of NIGHTSTAR near the three sixteenths, kept on
but was outkicked for place. HONEY MUG chased five wide down the backstretch, bid outside the leading pair into the turn, raced in range three wide on
the turn, did not keep pace with the the leaders into the lane, and came back mildly outside late. NIGHTSTAR tracked the leader down the backstretch and
two wide on the turn, could not get to the leader in the stretch, and flattened in the final sixteenth. SHE'S FIRE AND ICE raced at the inside of the chasing
flight down the backstretch, settled toward the rear in the two path on the turn, was driven into the stretch well behind the main group, took mildly closer
order in upper stretch, and ran evenly late. EADS BRIDGE came out and bumped PALETTE in the opening strides, chased between horses early, settled
back into the turn, trailed in the three path around the bend and offered no rally. PALETTE was fractious in the gate, took up after being bumped soundly by
EADS BRIDGE in the opening strides, settled at the rear, continued near the rear in the five path on the turn and made no bid.

Footnotes
GONZO raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and closed rapidly in the final sixteenth of a mile to
just get up for the win. RIPE ATTACK led the field from the two path up the backstretch and around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was
caught in the final strides. YABA DABA DOO raced between horses in the middle of the pack early, came around the turn in the two path and gained ground
on the outside in late stretch. TWO PAIR chased the leader between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn
and finished evenly. TRE LEE DIVINE raced outside at the back of the pack in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and made a mild
bid between horses in late stretch. BUDDY BUD raced between horses towards the back of the pack up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the
three path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. YOUNG CORBETT raced inside at the pack of the pack early, came around the turn in the two path and
finished evenly while never threatening. PABLO DEL MONTE was pinched back leaving the gate, recovered to press the pace early, continued to chase the
leader from the two path around the turn and tired in the final furlong. LEE'S LUCK chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around
the turn and faded in the stretch. FRENCH MINDED raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn
from the three path and made no bid. TIZ TOO MUCH chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the four path
around the turn and was empty from there. RED DIRT ROAD dropped back early in the race, trailed the field the entire way around the oval and was never
a factor. PER ILLINOIS STEWARDS' RULING #204114, GONZO HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FROM 1ST AND DECLARED UNPLACED DUE TO A
