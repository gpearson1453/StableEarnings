Footnotes
INVEST stalked the earlier pace then swept to the front about the three path approaching the turn, was soon clear and drew off to show much the best.
LECTRIC CHOKE saved ground the opening turn and raced well off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid at the rail into the far turn, angled to the five
path entering the stretch and dueled through the stretch to earn second. APPRAISED stalked off the rail then picked up the chase approaching the far turn,
raced in the three path through the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. RED CLAY ROAD rated the pace inside, was caught approaching
the far turn then faded at the rail through the turn. PREQUALIFIED settled off the pace, bid at the rail into the far turn, left the far turn two deep and finished
evenly. JUST CHILL OUT raced well off the pace, rounded the far turn in the six and seven paths and was not a factor. MINE TO HOLD was nota factor.

PALACE KID was hustled to the front soon after the start, raced clear at the rail on the turn but gave up the lead a sixteenth away. TWINSTINCT had a brief
early lead then gave chase soon after the start, raced close off the rail through the turn and finished evenly. K W CAPTAIN FLINT gave chase, raced in the
four path of the turn and finished evenly. KISSEDTHEGIRLS chased the leaders, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole.
EXCHANGE FEVER gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little more. COWBOY GANDHI was never a factor and raced
wide on the turn.

Footnotes
BRUTUS stalked the pace from the two and three paths then challenged into the far turn, took the nod midway through the turn and dug in determinedly to
inch ahead of IN HIM WITH HIM, who rated the pace inside, came under pressure into the far turn and gave up the nod at the rail midway through the turn,
then dug in gamely to the finish while grudgingly ceding. MOONLIGHT SHADOW stalked from the inside, raced at the rail on the turn and finished evenly.
ZITMAN raced off the pace outside, rounded the turn about the four path and finished evenly. EARNED IT settled off the early pace in the three and four
paths, bid off the rail into the far turn, angled five wide through the turn and showed little more. SPRING EMPEROR raced in the four path the opening turn
then stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase approaching the far turn but faded off the rail through the turn. MOKHEEF saved ground.

Footnotes
MALIBU MISCHIEF quickly cleared the field for inside position and rated the pace, was kept alert through the upper stretch then taken in hand the final
furlong. I'M THE TALENT was forced inward and into S W Briar Rose leaving the gate then picked up the chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn
off the rail, angled to the four path into the lane but had to settle for second best. S W BRIAR ROSE was jostled at the break then picked up the chase
through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and finished evenly. AULDWOOD LANE broke outward to make contact with S W Briar Rose
then picked up the chase, rounded the turn about the three path and passed a rival. CHIEFS KINGDOM broke inward to make contact with I'm The Talent
then picked up the chase, rounded the turn at the rail but showed little further.

Footnotes
PRINCESS COREY closed to contention to stalk the pace two deep, took the lead into the stretch, was driven away to the eighth pole then under an
agressive hand ride the final sixteenth. BE GOOD chased the pace inside, rounded the turn off the rail then dug in through the stretch to retain second.
BOURBON WILDCAT ducked in across the path of the late breaking Street Nonsense then stalked the early pace outside, steadied into the turn and
rounded the turn just off the rail, raced evenly to late stretch then flattened stride. RONA was brushed lightly at the break then picked up the chase inside,
raced at the rail on the turn then finished evenly mid-track. MISS OLD BAY angled to the inside to raced clear, rounded the turn near the rail, gave up the
lead leaving the turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. LUCETTA'S ON FIRE raced well back from early contention and raced in the seven path of the
turn. LOVE MY CAT mostly saved ground. CAPRICHOSA was reluctant to load then stalked the earlier pace, but dropped back past the half mile pole,
rounded the turn about the three path, angled to the five path into the lane but showed little more. STREET NONSENSE broke a step slow then stalked the
pace, rounded the turn in the five and six paths and showed little further. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Bourbon Wildcat, lodged
by the rider of Rona, though took no action.

Footnotes
PLOT THE DOTS settled off the early pace toward mid track, took aim three wide on the turn and took the lead in the upper stretch then dug in under
determined handling to hold off the game stretch challenge of ZABRACADABRA, who settled off the pace outside, took aim four wide midway on the turn
and dug in gamely from the head of the stretch, while ultimately turned back through the final yards. GENTLEMAN JOE settled off the pace outside, raced in
range five wide on the turn then flattened out a distant third. CROUCHELLI saved earlier ground then angled to the seven path on the turn and finished
evenly outside. TOM HAGEN stalked the earlier pace then moved to even terms past the three eighths pole, contested the edge two deep on the turn but
was caught entering the stretch and weakened. BOLD QUEST rated close to the early pace inside then steadied at the rail leaving the half mile pole,
continued at the rail through the turn then weakened. TROUVER settled off the pace, raced in the three path of the turn then weakened. ADMIRE broke a
step slow and settled off the pace toward the outside, picked up the chase into the turn but showed little more. AL BROWN rated a slim early lead but was
headed at the rail past the three eighths pole, gave up the lead nearing the head of the lane then faded through the lane.

Footnotes
COMPLETE SURPRISE pressured the pace two deep while between horses and took the lead into the turn, raced clear entering the stretch and dug in
under steady handling to hold on well. THE BOSS OF YOU pressured the pace and raced close in the four path of the turn then dug in under steady
encouragement from the head of the lane to duel for second. HAPPYCREST chased the pace and steadily improved about the five path of the turn then
outfinished in the stretch duel for second. A TOAST TO KAY chased the pace and rounded the turn off the rail, eased three wide into the stretch but
flattened stride the final quarter. HOLIDAY CURLS gave chase outside, raced in the four path of the turn and showed little further. ALPHARDINI accelerated
to the front along the rail to set the early pace, but was caught into the turn, dropped back at the rail midway through the turn and weakened from the head
of the lane. TROPICAL FROSTY gave chase through the backstretch then faded on the turn. Pending review, fractions and final time have been omitted.
