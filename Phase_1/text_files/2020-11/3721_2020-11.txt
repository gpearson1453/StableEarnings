NOTE TO SELFIE was content to lag while racing well out into the track, angled to the rail nearing the stretch while rallying, came out between rivals for the
drive and edged clear through the final seventy yards. LOOKIN KINDA CRAZY stayed close to the inside around the turn, swung out entering the stretch,
couldn't match the winner in the drive but outfinished the others. MOON HEIST opened a clear lead before going a furlong, stayed close to the inside
around the turn, ran out entering the stretch and gave way through late stretch. MOON CHANT raced forwardly on the outside, gave her best three wide on
the turn then flattened out. HILL VALLEY swung wide into the stretch and lacked a closing response. STEPH'S PRINCESS chased the early leader, edged
closer two wide before a half then tired. IL MIO AMORE swung wide into the stretch and tired while no factor.

AIN'T MISBEHAVIN broke slowly, was unhurried,. rallied three wide around the final turn, took over nearing the final furlong and drew out under urging.
MONEYBAGS made a four wide run around the final turn but failed to sustain through the lane. CATTLE DRIVE made a wide run around the first turn to
press outside the early leader, moved two wide to a clear lead early on the far turn then faded inside through the lane. CLINIC wasn't far back around the
first turn then quickly faded. MAJESTIC WOODY made a two wide run between horses around the final turn then stopped. SWITCHBLADE made the early
pace along the rail and was finished after six furlongs. ALGORIX quickly lost contact and was eased up.

Footnotes
BUSCH LATTE moved up between horses early to duel, stayed out from the rail around the turn, moved clear from between foes leaving the furlong
grounds and held. JOZANI R V F moved to vie three wide on the turn, fell back leaving the furlong grounds and continued willingly. REVANS REIGN wasn't
far back inside but lacked a rally. MARC WELLS swung wide into the stretch while trailing and finished fast. TRUSTED REDEMPTION stayed inside and
made up some ground through the lane. EYES OF ZEUS came out on the turn while not far back then weakened in the lane. GOLDEN VIPER dueled
outside the winner for over five furlongs then tired. WILLING HERO was reluctant to load, ducked out sharply leaving the gate and was outrun.
HONORABLE WAY was wide and stopped.
