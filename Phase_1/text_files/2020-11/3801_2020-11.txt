Footnotes
MISTER OAKLEY cleared early, had an open length advantage through a tepid first quarter, never seriously challenged as the pace quickened, particularly
in the second quarter. COPINSAY settled off the pace and moved up between rivals on the turn, tipped three wide turning for home and was up for the place
inside the sixteenth pole, no threat to the winner. NORTHERN THUNDER was off the pace and along the rail, came up the inside on the turn into second
turning for home, hard ridden to hold show after the place horse drove by at the sixteenth. ICOMEFROMDOWNTOWN devoid of early foot, came three to
four wide around the turn and was fanned out into the six path turning for home, finding his best stride late while still very wide. TORAH'S BLESSING came
up inside the winner coming out of the chute, was taken a hold of to allow that one the front, tried to bid at the quarter pole and stayed in the mix for a minor
award until the sixteenth pole, fading from there. RIVERRUN had no early foot, moved onto the inside from the two path late on the turn and followed the
eventual third place finisher up the inside down the lane, levelling off in the final sixteenth. SECRET PATH chased the leader in the two path early, drifted
out into the three path around the turn when falling back, just going up and down in the stretch. CONQUER HIM off the pace, trailed four to five wide on the
turn, out in the seven path turning for home, never in contention.

hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then rallied gamely from between foes. THE REIGN MAN stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide
on the turn then finished evenly. CHARLES STREET settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail through the turn, was blocked upper stretch then rallied

Footnotes
BLOCKBUSTER stalked the pacesetter, bid early on the far turn, led into the backstretch, set a pressured pace while well in hand, moved clear into the far
turn, turned back SEGUIMI then widened in the stretch under intermittent encouragement and was taken in hand near the wire. NESTLETON HUSH raced
in mid pack, chased three-wide on the far turn then finished gamely. SEGUIMI led briefly, forced the pace on the backstretch, moved outside the pacesetter
and tried him on the turn, could not match strides and chased through the stretch, losing place near the wire. ORAZIO stalked the pace, was hustled from
the rail on the far turn and rallied gamely. REDOUTE'S LIGHT, away slowly and off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn then finished
under a determined drive. UNO CHAMP, in range, was hustled on the far turn then showed some interest in the stretch but failed to show a late gain.
SHOW ME YOUR SPOTS, off slowly, settled in mid pack, chased hard four then three-wide on the far turn but evened out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BURNING LOVE cleared early when outrunning a couple of rivals for the front, had a clear lead for the final five furlongs, the result never in doubt, the rider
keeping busy. BORN TO BE KING settled in mid pack, circled three to four wide into contention for the second spot late on the turn, was a clear runner-up
in mid stretch and held that spot, no threat to the winner. OVER THE HILLS was steadied out when between runners into the turn, stayed in the two path
rallying around the turn, angled out at the eighth pole and was coming fast in the final sixteenth, settling for an unlucky third. ORPHAN HALLIE trailed
midway on the turn before moving up two to four wide, angled out in upper stretch and was closing belatedly, his best stride in the final seventy yards.
SHARP'S RIVER along the rail and off the pace early, angled out in upper stretch, outgamed for fourth while inching up late. KNOTTY BY DESIGN trailed
early, moved up in behind runners in upper stretch, lost his path and steadied in upper stretch, then closed noticeably in the final sixteenth. IMMACULATE
INNING was in mid pack early, advanced outside a rival in behind the front runner and got into the runner up spot midway on the turn, but could not sustain
his bid and faded in the final furlong. RIGHTEOUS ROBBIE devoid of early foot, rallied two to four wide on the turn and out in the six path turning for home,
inching past a few tired foes late. KEEN SAMURAI led very briefly, sat back to chase the winner between rivals into the turn, wilting down the stretch. ONE
WAY TO WIN stalked outside the trio of rivals chasing the winner, was asked to advance midway on the turn in the three path but stalled in upper stretch,
lugging in at the eighth pole and dropping back. CARDIFF HALL off the pace throughout, trying to move up three to four wide on the turn and widest into the
stretch, failing to reach contention. CONCHY JOE rushed up the rail to inside chase the leader, dropping back midway on the turn to the wire. THE RIDER
OF KNOTTY BY DESIGN CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF DUKE OF MIAMI IN UPPER STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW, THE STEWARDS
DISALLOWED THE CLAIM OF FOUL.
