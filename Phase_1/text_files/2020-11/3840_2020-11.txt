JILLS PASSION pressed the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and edged clear down the lane under a steady drive. FIRST LADY MAGGIE set
the pace early, raced along the inside into the lane, was overtaken near the eighth pole and no match for the winner in the final stages. SWORN SILENCE
chased the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. TRACI'S GREELEY was a bit slow at the start, chased the pace
early, raced in the five path into the lane, drifted out a bit in the upper stretch and faded late in the stretch drive. NORTHERN CONNECT was a bit slow at
the start, raced in the six path into the lane, was put in tight and steadied in the upper stretch and moved up in the late stages. UNFADING BEAUTY was
never a threat. SWEET BRYNLIE was done early. STELLAR STILETTO was off slowly, trailed the field throughout and was eased late in the stretch.

Footnotes
BEACHWALKER chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch and inched clear in the final stages. PATRIOT'S
WAR chased the pace early, ranged up three wide nearing the lane, was in the four path into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch and gave in during
the late stages. HAWK OF WAR broke awkwardly, pressed the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. REIGNING
SPIRIT set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and faltered late in the stretch drive. COMBATING was never a threat. DO YOUR BEST stalked
the pace early three wide, hit the rail hard into the far turn.

Footnotes
CHANDELLE tipped off of the inside to the four path at the three furlong pole to track outside of leading foes, rallied turning for home, produced a bid in
midstretch while shifting inwards, put SUNSHINE CITY to tight quarters at the sixteenth pole while sharing blame with an inner rival, then prevailed
approaching the wire. YELLOWSTONE GIRL set the pace along the inside, dug in to hold a clear advantage through upper stretch, but tired and drifted
outwards inside the final furlong, and put SUNSHINE CITY to tight quarters at the sixteenth pole while getting surpassed by CHANDELLE. SUNSHINE CITY
stalked three wide, inched closer turning for home, but was repelled by the inner leader passing the quarter pole as CHANDELLE ranged up along side,
kept on under a long drive between those foes through the lane, but was put to tight quarters by both rivals at the sixteenth pole, steadied, then was
wrapped up thereafter. DASH TO THE TOP rushed through the opening furlong to a stalking position along the inside, but chased the leaders through the
lane and failed to produce a bid. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME stalked two wide and between horses around the turn, but failed to produce a bid before weakening
in upper stretch. MOONSHINE DANCING trailed in the four to six path around the turn, got outrun, and was eased through the lane. Following the race, the
rider of SUNSHINE CITY claimed foul against the riders of YELLOWSTONE GIRL and CHANDELLE for interference in deep stretch, but it was disallowed
by the Stewards.

CREDIT ENHANCEMENT stalked three wide while perching herself outside of the dueling leaders, inched closer to bid at the five sixteenths pole, assumed
command in upper stretch, drew off eagerly through midstretch under driving pressure, and was wrapped up approaching the wire. SPY A STAR rallied
while saving ground turning for home, tipped three wide in midstretch, and caught MY GIRL LEXI approaching the wire for place. MY GIRL LEXI dueled for
the lead two wide, came in to the lane with a narrow margin between horses, but quickly proved no match for her outer counterpart in upper stretch, then
lost place approaching the wire. HAPPYGOBUCKY dueled along the inside, but gave way to outer foes passing the five sixteenths pole, and weakened
through the lane. NANCY WORK hopped a bit at the start, chased from midpack along the inside, tipped to the four path at the quarter pole, but drifted out
multiple paths approaching the furlong marker, and failed to produce a bid. CELESTIAL SPIN tracked from midpack five wide around the turn, but tired in
upper stretch. FREEDOM BOUND was brushed a bothered by an outer foe at the start, recovered to lied forwardly placed two wide and between horses,
tipped to the four path into the bend to be outside of leading foes, then was floated to the five path at the quarter pole, and weakened. SUGAR DIVA raced
far off of the pace in the three path and between horses around the turn, and failed to factor. LAKE SENSE trailed in the four path around the turn, and was
outrun.

ALGEBRAIC set the pace along the inside, kicked clear from a pressing rival in upper stretch, and held sway under driving pressure. SAM AND SY chased
along the inside, saved ground around the turn, rallied along the rail to forge place from outer foes passing the furlong pole, shifted out approaching the
sixteenth pole, then chased the clear leader home. HYGH I. Q. vied two wide, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch, herded out
a bit from SAM AND SY while tiring approaching the sixteenth pole, and held show. GENERATOR raced off of the pace four wide around the turn, chased
the leader evenly through the lane, and brushed with TWO WORLD at the sixteenth pole. TWO WORLDS raced off of the pace two wide and between
horses around the turn, shifted three wide in midstretch while inside of GENERATOR, but was put to a bit of tight quarters by an inner foe at the sixteenth
pole, and steadied mildly after brushing his outer counterpart. DRUNKEN LOVE trailed along the inside, swung five wide turning for home, and never got
involved. COPLEY got rank at the start, stalked three wide, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole. Following the race, the rider of TWO
WORLDS claimed foul against the rider of SAM AND SY for interference in the stretch, but it was disallowed by the stewards

Footnotes
KIM K prompted the pace two wide, drew off in upper stretch, and held under driving pressure. FIGURE IT OUT stalked the leading duelers from the three
path, then reached place at the sixteenth pole while chasing KIM K home. SINGITA DREAMS saved ground off of the pace, but failed to keep pace with
outer foes in upper stretch, shifted to the three path, then stayed on to reach show at the wire. EXTRA EFFORT set the pace along the inside, but was
headed by her pressing counterpart at the quarter pole, and weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
STAY HAPPY prompted the pace two wide and between horses, drew off in upper stretch, and widened under driving pressure. TOWN DRUNK stalked
three wide under urging, then chased STAY HAPPY through the lane and proved second best. WAR VETERAN took the turn two wide and between horses
around the turn, then rallied to split foes four wide at the furlong pole, and reached show approaching the wire. CONTINUUM stalked two wide around the
turn, but chased the clear leader through the lane before weakening in the final sixteenth. MAKABIM was off poorly, trailed in the three path into the turn,
swung to the six path turning for home, and stayed on mildly. ATMOS stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid. AIR FORCE JET (GB) was sent
to set the pace along the inside, but weakened in upper stretch. FIREHORN raced far off of the pace along the inside into the turn, swung to the seven path
turning for home, and failed to factor. ALBERT'S BARN tracked from midpack four wide, but weakened after drifting to the five path at the quarter pole.
TWINKLING KNIGHT tracked from midpack three wide and between horses down the backstretch, but was done early.
