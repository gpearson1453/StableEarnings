Footnotes
I DON'T WANT TO GO set the pace inside, was driven in upper stretch, kept on well clear, and was geared down for the final forty yards. HUNTER'S
HELLCAT tracked the leader outside of BURKHART, continued to track in closest range of I DON'T WANT TO GO through the far turn, went to a drive in
upper stretch, proved no match for the winner, and kept on a clear second best. GOLDEN LILY grazed the gate, settled at the rear, edged closer three wide
past the five eighths, improved position on the far turn, was driven past the five sixteenths and taken three wide in upper stretch, and chased on best of the
rest. BROADWAY DUCHESS settled in second last, continued near the rear through the far turn, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, and passed tiring
horses. SHES GOT ME GOING broke inward and bumped COCOA PARFAIT in the opening strides, chased under a hold early, was pushed along to keep
the leading pair in her sights through the far turn, but weakened two wide in the lane. BURKHART tracked the pace inside of HUNTER'S HELLCAT, emptied
out at the half, faded inside foes through the far turn and was no further factor in the lane. COCOA PARFAIT was bumped in the opening strides, chased
toward the rear of midpack early, but was outpaced past the half. NO HEAD-ON REPLAY WAS AVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ANTALYA was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside in the opening stages, steadily gained position inside foes leaving the far turn, shifted
out racing into upper stretch to split rivals four deep leaving the furlong marker and narrowly prevailed in time under firm right handed pressure.
KINGSBURY DREAM, reserved along the inside in the opening half, saved ground through the far turn, angled off the inside entering the lane to advance
on the leaders six wide leaving midstretch and continued willingly to close the gap. CHLOBEE tracked the leaders in second flight under light rating along
the inside, switched outside the pacesetter racing into upper stretch, moved to strike the front between calls late but was collared by the top pair. GOOD
MONGOLIA sprinted to the lead while angling to the rail racing into the backstretch, turned back a rival racing into upper stretch, then resisted the top trio to
the closing stages but yielded late. BEE BIT tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch but steadily
faded in the drive SAGE'S EPIPHANY settled in the last flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn to upper stretch gaining some position
but lacked the needed late kick. GO YEOWOMEN settled outside foes tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch but offered no rally. MARIA
ROSE angled inwards to track off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch but steadily faded nearing the lane. SHOWIT, forwardly placed
tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, lodged a brief bid nearing upper stretch but proved empty in the last furlong. SAPPHIRE JUBILEE
settled last racing to the backstretch and trailed the field into the stretch. NORTHERN ALLIANCE, caught a bit wide racing into the first turn, tracked off the
second flight outside foes for a half but retreated early.

Footnotes
SACRA HOXEN broke out and bumped SQUIRRELY MIKE in the opening strides, pressed the pace three wide early, took the lead between horses
approaching the seven sixteenths, cleared into the lane and held sway. LINE OF DENHAMS tucked in just behind the leading flight, tracked the leading
flight on the turn and into the lane, was taken out past the three sixteenths, and chased on a clear second best under a drive. A SHEEN CAT was bumped
by PUNCHNGO in the opening strides and pushed into DISTINCT THUNDER as a result, chased between horses, went to a drive inside in upper stretch,
and chased on willingly. BE AN INSPIRATION was bumped by CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN in the opening strides as a result of the chain reaction from
PUNCHNGO breaking inward, settled at the rear of midpack while well off the rail, was urged four wide on the turn, and kept on best of the rest four wide in
the lane. SQUIRRELY MIKE was bumped by SACRA HOXEN in the opening strides, attended the pace four wide early and three wide on the turn, and
flattened out between horses in the lane. POCHO'S DREAM settled at the rear, took closer order while saving ground on the turn, was taken five wide into
upper stretch and continued mildly outside tiring horses. ROCKET RIDE chased midpack inside horses early and in the two path on the turn, improved
position slightly in upper stretch, was put in tight behind the fading SQUIRRELY MIKE near the furlong mark, and flattened out. CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN
bumped into BE AN INSPIRATION in the opening strides as a result of the collision between PUNCHNGO and A SHEEN CAT, was pushed along early to
chase outside of A SHEEN CAT early, chased four wide on the turn and had no rally in the lane. PUNCHNGO broke out and bumped A SHEEN CAT in the
opening strides, raced between horses in the leading flight early, but weakened two to three wide on the turn and was no further factor. IRISH LIGHTED
ROAD broke outward, nonetheless set the pace early, was headed approaching the seven sixteenths by SACRA HOXEN, attended inside briefly, and
weakened past the three eighths. DISTINCT THUNDER took up when bumped between horses in the opening strides, settled near the rear, raced in
second last in the four path on the turn, and made no rally. HELLFIRE settled in second last early, trailed in the five path on the turn and offered no bid.

Footnotes
CHATTER BOX, caught a bit wide racing into the first turn while prompted to a contending position, tracked the pacesetter outside rivals in second flight into
the backstretch, steadily advanced on that foe to take over racing into upper stretch and just maintained the advantage to the end under firm handling.
LORING PARK angled to the inside while being reserved off the third flight in the opening half, saved ground to the lane, then shifted off the inside splitting
rivals in late stages to bid inside the winner and narrowly prevailed for the place honors. DYNABLUE tracked off the second flight outside foes in the
opening half, advanced three deep racing into the lane to close the gap on the winner but was outkicked for second. SILENT STEVE, reserved between
foes in the last flight in the opening stages, swung six wide racing into upper stretch and was going well late. KENNESAW angled to the inside tracking just
off the pacesetter as part of the second flight, came through to bid inside rivals racing into the lane but had no final kick. DEJOHN tracked off the second
flight outside foes and continued evenly four wide in late stages. ROCKET HOTSHOT, brushed at the start, was held up in the last flight early, shifted out
racing into the lane and passed between tiring rivals. MACHO CLASSIC, urged to gain a clear advantage along the rail racing into the first turn, set the pace
into the second bend and gave way in upper stretch once headed by the winner. GAGOOTS settled into stride off the inside and failed to menace.
COMPELLUS proved no factor. SEATTLE SEE YA, a bit rank along the inside early tracking just off the second flight to the backstretch, steadily faded
nearing the lane. KING'S STORY was a brief factor between foes in second flight but retreated early.

GOOD NEWS broke out and lightly bumped B REWARDING in the opening strides, chased the leading trio four wide early, bid four wide on the turn, came
into the lane still four wide, led approaching the furlong mark and drove clear. WAR COLORS chased midpack down the backstretch and in the two path on
the turn, swung five wide in upper stretch, and rallied to prove second best. NURSE SADIE raced in the rear pair inside of OUR MARDI GRAS early,
improved position while saving ground through the turn, altered five wide behind traffic in upper stretch, and kept on willingly. COLOROFACLOUD tracked
the leading trio early, advanced to prompt the leader inside past the nine sixteenths, took a narrow lead approaching the seven sixteenths, came into the
lane between horses, was headed by DIAMONDS AND BOOTS in upper stretch, briefly vied, proved no match for GOOD NEWS approaching the furlong
mark and flattened out. DIAMONDS AND BOOTS was reluctant to load, tracked the leading pair advanced inside past the nine sixteenths to prompt the
leader, tracked the leading flight on the turn, was urged for a bid up the inside in upper stretch, briefly led in upper stretch, but was headed by GOOD NEWS
approaching the furlong mark and weakened. B REWARDING was lightly bumped by GOOD NEWS in the opening strides but nonetheless came away
sharply to the lead, was headed approaching the seven sixteenths, attended the pace three wide on the turn, was driven three wide in upper stretch and
flattened out. FLAMING was reluctant to load, settled in third last early, came into the turn three wide in the rear flight, was urged while trailing in the six path
on the turn, swung seven wide into the lane and offered no rally. LILL QUEEN B prompted the early pace inside of B REWARDING, began to lose ground at
the nine sixteenths, flattened in the four path on the turn and had nothing more for the drive. OUR MARDI GRAS was slow into stride, settled outside of
NURSE SADIE in the rear pair, was urged in the four path on the turn and taken six wide to the lane, but proved empty.

Footnotes
IHADADREAM, reserved off the second flight along the inside, split foes after a half, saved ground on the far turn steadily gaining contention, shifted out
three wide near midstretch and wrested the advantage in time under energetic handling. HOMELAND MESSA sprinted clear of the field along the inside
racing to the backstretch, dictated the pace into upper stretch, resisted a rival's challenge racing past midstretch but just failed to contain the winner. TETSU
angled to the inside early tracking just off the second flight, steadily advanced on the pacesetter racing into the far turn, shifted outside that foe to bid for
command racing into upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. V MAN tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening half, was prompted to
advance while being fanned six wide racing into the lane but lacked the needed final kick while gaining position to the end. ROAR OF THE LION settled
outside foes racing to the backstretch, then improved position four wide between foes in the closing stages. TRES GENERACIONES settled along the
inside early, saved ground racing into the far turn but lacked a closing response. Z U SOON, urged to position between foes in second flight tracking the
leaders from just out of striking distance racing to the far turn, steadily faded into the stretch. UNCLE PADDY settled between foes racing to the backstretch
and never gained contention. DONIVAN MY BOY settled outside foes in the opening half and proved no factor. TORNADO BOY tracked the pacesetter
three deep in second flight for a half and gave way racing into the far turn. RED DIRT ROAD broke inwards, then was held up last in the opening half and
never menaced thereafter. TELETAP, urged to gain a forward placing while switching outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, continued in brief
pursuit of that foe to the second bend and came up empty midway through the turn.

Footnotes
FASCILITATOR chased outside of LIBERAL LUNACY early at the rear of the main group, rallied between horses on the turn, sustained his bid in the lane,
and got up in time outside. MALPAIS raced between horses in the leading flight past the five eighths, prompted outside of HURTS SO GOOD on the turn,
vied outside him in the lane, took the lead past the furlong mark, but was caught late. HURTS SO GOOD was lightly bumped by JACK VAN BERG in the
opening strides, sent to the lead, set the pace while pressured by MALPAIS, vied inside of that foe in upper stretch, and weakened past the furlong mark.
ONE FOR RICHIE tracked the leading trio early, continued to track in the two path on the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch, but proved no match for
the leaders. AMERICAN HERITAGE bobbled in the opening strides, advanced to race three wide in the leading flight past the five eighths, tracked the
leading pair on the turn, came four wide into upper stretch, but chased on as no match for the leaders. JACK VAN BERG broke slightly outward and lightly
bumped HURTS SO GOOD, chased two wide, swung five wide into upper stretch, and lacked the needed finishing kick. MEXICO MEMORIES bumped after
COLONEL KLINK after that one was bumped by PRESIDENT ELECT, settled near the rear, raced in the four path on the turn, went to a drive six wide in
upper stretch and passed tiring horses. COLONEL KLINK bobbled at the break, was pinballed between horses in the opening strides, settled at the rear,
trailed in the four path on the turn, was taken toward the center of the track in upper stretch and passed outside of tiring horses. LIBERAL LUNACY chased
inside of FASCILITATOR early, raced in the three path on the turn, came into the lane between horses and never threatened. MEDAL OF FACT prompted
the early pace inside through the opening furlong, began to lose ground past the five eighths, weakened through the turn, raced three wide in upper stretch
and continued to flatten out. PRESIDENT ELECT broke out and bumped COLONEL KLINK soundly, settled in second last in the two to three path on the
turn, and lacked a needed rally. SHANGHAI POINT chased outside of JACK VAN BERG early, was urged three wide on the turn but began to lose position,
was driven in upper stretch while still three wide, and faded.

Footnotes
LIL B QUICK broke readily to gain a forward placing along the rail prompting the pacesetter, was held up momentarily avoiding close quarters nearing the
turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch to challenge for command, wrested the advantage and went clear under firm encouragement. KIPPER
DOODLE tracked off the first flight outside rivals racing to the turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane and continued with interest to edge a rival for the
place honors on the wire. MORA VALLEY, urged outside the pacesetter prompting that rival in the opening stages, pressed the issue between foes into the
stretch and just missed for second while failing to match the winner late. DEVIL'S ROSE hopped at the start, settled between foes in the last flight racing to
the turn, split foes racing into upper stretch and found her best stride in the closing stages racing four wide to the wire to gain position to the end. COUNTRY
ASSETS tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out racing through the stretch but had no final kick. DANCE tracked off the
second flight between foes racing to the bend and continued evenly to late stages. LUCKY AT JUSTICE threw her head at the start while breaking slowly,
angled to the inside early, saved ground to the stretch but lacked a rally. MY DARLING SOFIA, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the first flight
racing to the turn, steadily faded nearing the lane. DEAUVILLE MIST settled outside foes in early stages, continued four, then five wide into the stretch and
had no rally. THIRSTY COWGIRL, carried out a bit at the start, was outpaced early. AMERICAN BIZ settled three deep between foes in the last flight and
failed to menace thereafter. CAN SHE SCOOT showed quickly in front, set the pace on a narrow margin between foes racing into the turn, shifted to the
inside on the bend dueling for command into upper stretch but gave way abruptly leaving the furlong marker.
