Footnotes
YES TO MISCHIEF led onto the main track, set the pace, widened upper stretch and held sway under a hand ride. ADVOCATING broke inward, settled in
mid pack, chased two to five-wide on the turn then rallied gamely outside. TWISTER ALERT, in range, angled two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the
stretch and finished under a determined drive. RIVER OF PEARLS stalked the pace, rode the rail on the turn then closed through the stretch but did not
menace. SMART MUNNY broke in the air and settled off the pace, angled from three to six-wide through the turn then posted a mild close in the stretch but
never reached contention. RAVEN'S SONG stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn then finished evenly. TEN HATS was herded inward at the
outset and was rank early, raced from off the pace, trailed to the stretch and passed a tiring foe. LACOUGRA stalked the pace, was roused two-wide late
turn but offered no response in the stretch.

Footnotes
PENETANGUISHENE moved up to a short early lead, set a pressured pace, shook shook clear upper stretch and held under a drive. BORN TO BE GOOD
raced in striking range, was hustled three then two-wide on the turn, rallied through the stretch and gained steadily. IF SIX WAS NINE settled off the pace,
closed on the turn, angled out entering the top of the stretch and rallied gamely. VENUS VERITY stalked the pace, chased angling from two to four-wide on
the turn then finished with a determined drive. BABY DRIVER, off slowly, gained mid pack on the backstretch, was hustled on the turn, failed with a bid at
the top of the stretch and chased to the end. SIMPLY A ZOOMER showed brief speed then stalked the pace, dropped back a bit on the turn, chased into the
stretch but finished evenly. HONEY GIRL, in range, was hustled five-wide on the turn but never reached contention. PLAYING SMART stalked the pace,
was hustled four-wide, dropped back late turn and lacked a rally. QUEEN BEACH showed early speed, forced the pace, came two and three-wide on the
turn, chased into the stretch and evened out. POCKET, away slowly and well off the pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn but never reached
contention. PARABLE showed speed then pressed the pace, dropped back late turn and had no closing response. GIANT SONET was away slowly and
settled off the pace, faded on the turn, was eased in the stretch, crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
GOTE GO off the pace early, circled around a group of tiring rivals to get into range midway on the far turn, brushed with the eventual second place finisher
in upper stretch when laying in, changed leads and got by the front runner nearing the seventy yard pole, gamely holding in the final stages. DIAMOND ORE
chased the two front runners in an open space down the backside, got into range when hesitating slightly and faltering midway on the turn, regrouped and
came off the rail in upper stretch to brush with the winner, battling inside that one down to the wire. RIGHT TO FREEDOM cleared from her inside post, held
off a stalker but set solid fractions to do so, still led into the stretch but tired and drifted out in the final seventy yards. LOVE IN THE AIR sat three wide
around the first turn in mid pack, advanced still in the three path on the far turn to loom outside the leaders at the quarter pole but could not sustain her bid
and stalled in the final eighth. MUNNYFOR RO stalked the early leader down the backside, tried to bid on the far turn but followed that speedster into the
stretch along the rail, stalling and dropping off in the final sixteenth. ROMY sat along the rail and off the pace, moved up inside to three wide around the far
turn before running greenly and drifting in to the rail in upper stretch, showing a nice burst of energy in the final seventy yards. RIGHT ROUND trailed into
the far turn, came inside to four wide with a mild rally into the stretch but evened out in the final sixteenth. CARELESS HEIRESS sat two wide in mid pack
through the first turn, dropped back two to three wide to trail on the far turn and lost contact in the stretch.

Footnotes
JILLI MARIE broke awkwardly and lost her footing momentarily at the start, rushed up the rail to chase inside the leaders, squeezed out between the
pacesetters turning for home and quickly assumed a clear advantage, holding safely to the wire. DEJAS TOO broke out at the start and settle in behind the
leaders between rivals and on the flank of the eventual winner, tipped out three wide turning for home and lugged in on her wrong lead in upper stretch, but
switched to her proper lead by the eighth pole, driving by outside to get the place spot in the final stages. MEET THE SOPRANO stalked the leader
throughout, drifted out a tad allowing the winner to get between her and the pacesetter turning for home, no match for that one's energy and losing the place
late. SUNSPRITE very headstrong, her rider grappling with her late backstretch for a good period of time, settled in and rallied into the back of rivals by the
quarter pole, finding room in upper stretch to make a run, but levelling off in the final seventy yards. RED EQUINOX broke in at the start, regrouped to come
up the inside in behind the front runners on the turn, had a rail move into upper stretch to be in position to do some damage but was outrun in the final
sixteenth. SPEEDY LYNN sat in mid pack while outside, came mildly three to five wide on the turn but could not contend in the stretch. SILENT GUROO
was on the lead quickly, the rider trying to ration her energy, stayed on until the turn for home, losing positions fast in the final eighth. ABSOLUTE
PRIVILEGE far back early, seemed to mildly rally three wide on the turn but could not enter the picture. SILENT SPARKLE broke on top and had the lead
for a brief period, settled in to chase four wide and always four to five wide on the turn, losing ground.

ANALYZER raced in mid pack, closed along the rail on the turn, angled out with a furlong on tap and blew by the leader mid stretch and finished under a
hand ride. SURE WOULD FOREST raced in mid pack, angled two to four-wide on the turn then rallied willingly outside. WESTERN TROUBLE stalked the
pace, angled from the rail to three-wide late turn, had the lead in the final furlong but was passed in mid stretch. STONE CARVER forced the pace from the
rail, bid into the turn, took a short lead and set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch, was headed a furlong out and gave chase. HITTERS
PARK stalked the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn, hung briefly upper stretch then finished with a late effort. BE VEWY VEWY QUIET stalked the
pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn and was all out in the stretch. BAY OF RUM settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide late turn,
chased into the stretch but failed to menace. DIDDLEY was sent to the early lead, set a pressured pace, was headed at the turn and forced the issue, was
pinched back at the top of the stretch when giving way and in tight between horses and evened out. O'KRATOS raced in mid pack, was hustled four then
three-wide on the turn but never reached contention.

Footnotes
GOLDEN AMI broke inward and bumped BETWIXTING, took the early early lead, set a reserved pace, widened upper stretch and continued to the wire in
hand and with authority. SUPER PATRIOTIC stalked the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch and finished gamely in vain. PINK SCRIBBLES raced in
mid pack, rode the rail on the turn then chased through the stretch. PATTON'S GIRL, in range, raced two-wide on the turn, moved to the rail in search of a
clear path and there was and she closed mildly. BETWIXTING, bumped at the start, settled in striking range, was hustled three-wide on the turn, chased into
the stretch and finished gamely. LILI'S SONG raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn then finished evenly. EXPRESS BANKING settled off the
pace, raced two-wide and from the rail on the turn then closed a gap in the stretch. MONASTERY LANE settled well back early, was hustled along, rallied
outside but was not a threat. WEST PAW settled in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. HAI
BOBBI moved up early to force the pace, was hustled three then two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but flattened out. LOVE DADDY was taken
back early and eased nearing the turn, did not finish and was vanned off.
