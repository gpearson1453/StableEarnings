STRIKE A STORM moved up to set a pressured pace, dueled through the stretch, drifted under left handed urging to be in tight late and prevailed in a long
drive. SACATONE pressed the pace three wide, dueled through the stretch, was in tight late and outfinished in a good effort. EYE FORTY rallied into the
turn to loom a threat, went five wide entering the stretch, bid and hung. NO DOUBT saved ground, closed inside and didn't have enough late. LIL LATIGO
was never far back, raced outside, went six wide leaving the turn and finished well. CAUSING CHAOS vied to the turn, dropped back, weakened in the drive
and lost position. AGRONOMO raced inside, was in tight and checked along the backstretch and closed well. NACI STRADAMUS failed to threaten in an
even effort. TANGUITO was off slowly, raced far back early, swung wide leaving the turn and improved position. JEWEL OF NAVARONE showed speed to
the turn and gave way. LORD SIRETT showed speed to the turn, stopped and was not urged late. The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning possible
interference in late stretch. No change was made.

SEXY DEXY set the pace to the turn, drew clear and extended his lead through the stretch. COLLINS AVE swung wide leaving the turn, couldn't gain
ground and was no match for the winner. ME raced close to the pace, lacked a stretch rally and finished best of the rest. INCLUDE HOO improved position
in an even effort. MIDNITE MASQUERADE pressed the pace, fell back on the turn, came up empty late and dropped back. GOLD NOTE was not a factor.
PAROLEE was outrun. OL' DRUNK DADDY failed to contend. GO NOW GO fell. TREBULSKI fell. Following a stewards' inquiry, COLLINS AVE was
disqualified and placed last for causing interference leaving the turn.

Footnotes
SINGING NICOLE was never far back, raced outside, bid five wide, closed steadily and wore down her rivals to get up late. KISS N KICK raced wide early,
rallied on the turn, closed willingly to be in contention late and was outfinished in a good effort. IMGOINOUTTONIGHT pressed the pace while racing along
the rail, fell back on the turn, closed inside and got up for show. LESSTALKMOREACTION pressed the pace, fell back on the turn, closed off the rail and
didn't have enough late. DANCES FOR KAMIA was slow early, bid mid track, found her best stride late and was gaining ground. NEW ADVENTURE set the
pace to deep stretch and gave way. LAKE MARY improved position in an even effort. PEACEOUTYOURHONOR raced in the back, swung wide leaving the
turn and lacked a response. TAX MONEY was outrun. SPECIAL CAT broke slowly, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. CAN'T GET AWAY raced
between horses, showed speed to the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
ABBIE'S WAY saved ground, angled out in the upper stretch, closed willingly, got up late and won going away. MY LITTLE RIVER set the pace with a clear
lead, led to deep stretch and was outclosed to finish second best. MCADOO was void of early speed, closed mid track and got up late for show while no
threat to the top two. MOVIN' ON BYE was in tight after the start, raced wide and put in a steady effort. WAGES angled in for the drive, bid and came up
empty. CREEKWATER PUNCH broke slowly, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. DELSMOKE was not a factor. RED OR GREEN flashed speed
and stopped. INDIAN DIVA failed to respond. NOBODY KNOWS WHO chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. LAST TO BLUSH was outrun.
