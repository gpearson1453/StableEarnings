SOUNION was bumped at the start, tracked the pace early three wide, was in the three path into the lane while making a bid, continued the bid down the
lane but did not have enough in the final stages. GLORY ROAD vied for the lead early on, was checked hard from between horses nearing the quarter pole,
raced in the three path into the lane and came again in the stretch run. TOTALLY JIMBO was bumped at the start, chased the pace early on, was on the
inside into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the stretch drive. SANTOS DUMONT chased the pace early on, made a bid up the rail in the
turn, led the field into the lane while off the rail but faded down the lane. READY TO ROLL set the pace for a half then folded up. The rider of GLORY ROAD
claimed an objection against the riders of SOUNION AND LETMENO for interference near the quarter pole but after review by the stewards the claim was

VICE VERSA stalked and two wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage in upper stretch before drawing clear approaching the
furlong pole, then held sway through the late stages under driving pressure. SOLOMONIC tracked three wide, but came under an all out drive passing the
three furlong pole, failed to keep pace with an inner rival in upper stretch, then chased that foe through the lane and held place. ORO DE TEJANO tracked
from midpack outside of foes in the five to four path around the turn, then stayed on late, but failed to reach place. SUPER SOL stalked along the inside,
shifted off of rail passing the quarter pole, then chased from behind the leader through the lane without producing a bid. KROY set the pace along the inside,
but was headed by the eventual winner in upper stretch, then faltered in the final sixteenth. DEBATING tracked from midpack in the four to three path
around the turn, and failed to factor. MISSISSIPPI took the turn in the two path off of the pace, and failed to mount a rally. FRAMMENTO was outrun.

A BIT OF BOTH stalked three wide, inched forward turning for home, bid for the lead and sparked a duel outside of AMBASSADOR LUNA approaching the
quarter pole, forged a narrow advantage her inner counterpart passing that marker, then dueled outside of that foe through the lane, and clung to her margin
to the wire. AMBASSADOR LUNA appeared to bobble a bit at the start, set a pressured pace along the inside, but was headed by A BIT OF BOTH passing
the quarter pole, dug in and persistently resisted that foe through the lane, dueled gamely, but failed to regain even terms. ON PROBATION tracked the
pace two wide and between horses, tipped three wide at the quarter pole, then to the four path in upper stretch, but chased the leaders while failing to keep
pace with them through the lane. SURRENDER NOW prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses turning for home, but failed to keep pace with both
of those foes at the quarter pole, then weakened through the lane. STILLWATER COVE stalked along the inside, but came under a drive to hold position
into the turn, then weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CADDO RIVER set the pace along the inside, held a clear advantage in hand around the turn, then responded when let out a notch passing the quarter
pole, drew off readily, and was ridden out under mild hand urging to the wire. ALEJANDRO rallied in the three path around the turn, reached place at the
furlong pole, and held that position from PARTNER'S HOPE late while not threatening the winner. PARTNER'S HOPE dwelt at the start and trailed early on,
rallied in the four path around the turn, lugged inwards mildly to the three path passing the quarter pole before altering to the five path while hanging on his
left lead approaching the furlong pole, then stayed on well while lugging in through the late stages. WINDCRACKER chased the clear leader two wide
around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch. KENTUCKY PHAROAH vied along the inside early on, took back to stalk passing the five furlong pole, but
failed to rebid before weakening in upper stretch. DETERMINED TO RISE failed to factor. RIVER REDEMPTION tracked form midpack two wide, but was
done early. HOMETOWN HERO tracked from midpack along the inside, but was done early.

Footnotes
PIT BOSS prompted the pace two wide, forged an advantage at the quarter pole as WORKING TITLE ranged up alongside, dueled gamely inside of that foe
while exchanging brushes, and prevailed in the battle on the wire. WORKING TITLE lied forwardly placed three wide, chased the leading duelers from the
three path around the turn, inched closer to make a bid for the lead outside of PIT BOSS at the quarter pole, dueled through the lane outside of that foe
while exchanging brushes, but was turned away late. MOTAGALLY set the pace, vied inside of a foe around the turn, but was headed by that rival and
another one at the quarter pole, and gave way to them passing the furlong grounds. TRIDENT HIT tracked from midpack two wide and between horses,
tipped to the four path passing the quarter pole, and stayed on through the lane. MISTER CANDY RIDE saved ground while trailing around the turn, shifted
two wide to pass a tiring foe turning for home, then failed to factor. SYMPHONIC stalked along the inside, but failed to keep pace into the turn, and
weakened. ICON raced off of the pace in the four path around the turn, then came into the lane in the five path and weakened without mounting a rally.

Footnotes
TAMANRASSETT stalked two wide while in the three path around the far turn, sustained a chasing grind through the lane to bid for the lead at the furlong
pole as SKY TEMPLE did the same along the rail, and prevailed over that foe on the wire. SKY TEMPLE vied inside of the leader around the first turn, took
back to stalk into the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, produced a bid for the lead along the inside at the furlong pole, but was outfinished by
an outer bidding foe. LOAD UP MOE brushed an inner foe after the start, trailed into the far turn, took that bend in the four path before swinging to the six
path turning for home, then rallied belated while trying to lug inwards. PATRIARCH ARTIE set the pace while shifting from the four path to the two path
around the first turn, tugged clear down the backstretch and held a margin into the lane, but weakened between horses passing the furlong pole. DOUBLE
TOUGH TIGER stalked three wide around both turns, then chased the leaders four wide through the lane, but failed to produce a bid. CALL PAPA broke a
step slowly and settled far off of the pace, gained mildly in the five path around the far turn, but failed to menace. PURE COURAGE tracked from midpack,
gained ground along the inside into the far turn, but flattened out around that bend. LOW TIDE WARNING was done early, and eased through the lane.
