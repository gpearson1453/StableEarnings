Footnotes
STORM STRIDE reserved off the pacesetters, raced four to five wide leaving the backstretch, advanced quickly outside then closed and was up deep
stretch. FAT N BITTER pressed the early pace inside, dueled through the final turn inside of CARRAMIAMINE, kept on determinedly and inched up for
place. CARRAMIAMINE vied outside leaving the chute, took pressure outside of FAT N BITTER, gained a slim advantage into the stretch and was caught
deep stretch. PRINCESS ROBBI stalked the pacesetters from the two path and lacked a closing response. SWEAR VENGENCE reared leaving, chased
three wide and tired.

CHIANTI took command, responded to challenge from SHARP CONTRAST near the quarter pole and held under a late drive. BABYLON WILL FALL saved
ground outside, asked to quicken leaving the final turn, rallied steadily and missed. SHARP CONTRAST prompted outside under a snug hold, moved up
alongside CHIANTI to challenge the lead but lacked the rally needed in the drive. I TRICKED MY RIDE broke outward from the gate, reserved off the
pacesetters and closed gradually under urging. LEENA squeezed out leaving then trailed through the backstretch, lodged a bid from the quarter pole and
failed to menace. AWESOMEAGAINNAGAIN saved ground and was outrun.

RAISE A DANCER stumbled away from the gate then lost path soon after leaving the gate, saved ground outside, advanced three wide into the final turn,
responded when given cue and won driving. HEY HEY RUN AWAY brushed leaving, hustled outside then angled in brushing ROX STAR WILDCAT, raced
three wide into the opening turn, lodged a rail bid into the stretch and was out finished. BELLA GALINA lacked the early speed inside then steadied into the
first turn, chased into the stretch and missed out for place. ROX STAR WILDCAT was brushed near the half marker then was in tight quarters and checked
in the far turn and bid belatedly. CELTIC GOLD hustled from the two path, chased inside and passed tiring rival. POP'S LITTLE GIRL brushed inside rival
leaving, sprinted clear then cut the corner and faltered into the stretch.

Footnotes
PROVOCATIVE PRINCE vied outside leaving the chute, set a pressed pace from the three path, disposed of rival leaving the backstretch, drew off into the
lane and was kept to handling. RED CHOCOLATE saved ground while four wide early, raced five wide entering the lane, closed outside improving position
late stretch but was no match for winner. CAPA BELLA tracked inside, roused after the quarter pole and was out kicked for second. TORCHLIGHT vied
inside leaving the chute, lugged out through the backstretch while prompting the pace, steadied entering the far turn, dropped back then kept on evenly
through the stretch under light handling. CARAT'S SONG lacked a serious bid. HE'S CRIMSON CODE showed little. BRING HOME STANLEY chased the
pacesetters while three to four wide and tired after the half.

Footnotes
MY SAMURAI WARRIOR tracked inside, angled towards the rail entering the lane, gained a slim advantage through the stretch and held on. STAPLETON
stalked five wide, drove four wide then drifted inward, angled out near the three sixteenth pole, lugged in under left handed encouragement, kept on outside
under steady handling to improve position then was bumped deep stretch. OJO DEL MAR set a pressured pace, dueled inside of LA MER into the final turn,
was under heavy urging through the stretch and was edged out late. LA MER contested the pace while two to three wide, dueled outside of OJO DEL MAR,
rallied between rivals under steady urging then was squeezed out and finished evenly. WILL TO GOLD gained closer order into the lane and rallied
belatedly from rail. BOLSANO sat mid pack from the three path, shifted out after the quarter pole and failed to menace in drive. ALBERTA BOUND raced at
the back of the pack and chased to no avail. INDICATIVE prompted while four wide and was done early. ROCK STEADY never reached contention.
*STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run. **JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of LA MER
against the rider of STAPLETON alleging interference in the stretch run was upheld. STAPLETON was disqualified for interference to LA MER and placed
fourth. ***TRAINER OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the trainer of LA MER against the rider of STAPLETON alleging interference in the stretch run
was upheld.

Footnotes
TRADER LYNN trailed early, took closer order leaving the backstretch, swung out into the lane and closed determinedly outside and was up just in time.
ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER tracked four to five wide, bid three wide at the three eighths marker, drifted in under right handed urging through the stretch
and was caught deep stretch. RISING REVOLUTION lacked running room in the backstretch, came under coaxing leaving the final turn and was out kicked.
WILSON set pace from the two path, came under pressure into the far turn and weakened in the stretch. STUMPANATOR pressed three to four wide, rallied
between foes in the final turn and yielded early stretch. GOTTCHA COWBOY chased inside and had no closing response when called upon. NO
COLLUSION offered little.

AT ATTENTION sat in range under a snug hold, cut the corner into the lane the dueled into the stretch inside of ZICATELA and edged clear under strong
hand ride. ZICATELA vied for the early lead, led the field into the far turn, drifted out at the quarter pole, responded to challenge from AT ATTENTION and
was out finished. STRIDERS RING taken back inside to settle just off the pace, raced four wide in pursuit of the leader but lacked the kick needed. CHASKA
stalked three wide, chased wide on the final turn and failed to threaten in drive. EDDYSHAK settled outside early, chased outside then angled in sharply into
the stretch and flattened. MIDNIGHT SHAKE bid belatedly. SHADED chased outside and tired. BE MY MACHO MAN reared leaving, chased inside and
