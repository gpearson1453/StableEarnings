Footnotes
TOMGARROW (IRE) was in no hurry during the early going, started to close the gap going down the hill heading for the backside the final time, got into
striking distance going to the final turn, took command at the shead of the stretch and kept drawing away. MOTIVATIONAL was well placed, started picking
up rivals going up the hill for the final time to be right there heading into the stretch but was no match for the winner. SKYDIVING was allowed to settle
towards the back, got into contention on the backside for the final time, was in striking distance at the head of the stretch but could not gain further
ground.BELISARIUS (IRE) was racing mid pack, started weakening going up the hill for the final time and kept losing ground in the stretch and was pulled
upj before the last jump and walked off. BOSS MAN took over command when SURPRISING SOUL went down after the 18th jump, had command heading
up the hill for the final time and stopped and was pulled up before the second last jump and walked off. GREAT ROAD raced in the back, started losing
touch with the field on the backside for the final time and was pulled up after the 11th jump. SURPRISING SOUL took command from the start, kept
increasing his lead and was way way out in front when he slipped after the 18th fence and went down.

Footnotes
A SILENT PLAYER (IRE) settled towards the back, started picking up rivals going down the backside and up the hill, rallied on the home turn, dueled with
MACCABEE over the last two jumps in the stretch and prevailed at the wire. MACCABEE was well placed, drafted the leader down the backside for the final
time, gained the lead briefly at the top of the hill and dueled with the winner thru the stretch and gave way late. BODES WELL (IRE) was always in
contention, rallied up the hill to get with the leaders heading into the stretch then gave way. OUR LEGEND (IRE) raced towards the back of the field, had a
mild rally heading to the final turn then ran evenly through the stretch. BRIANBAKESCOOKIES ran evenly through out and was no threat here. NOT IN
CHARGE showed the way from the start, gave up that position on the backside for the final time and kept falling back during the stretch run. FAMILY TREE
(GB) was in contention when he fell at the 8th jump, walked off. ZANZI WIN (FR) was well placed, rallied through the stretch but fell at the second last fence
and was vanned off. GO GET THE BASIL raced mid pack, tried to rally through the stretch and fell over the fallen rival at the second last jump and walked
off. SPORTSWEAR (GB) left course before the first jump and pulled up and walked off.

ALL OUT OF ACES raced towards the back quietly gain ground on the backside, rallied heading into the stretch to gain command in the straight and drew
clear heading to the last jump. INCLUDE IT settled mid pack but never far from the lead, made his run coming off the far turn but was no match for the
winner. HIGH SIERRA was well placed made a run coming off the home turn but could not gain further ground on the leaders. TRICKED UP took command
and made all the run until coming up the hill for the final time and then stopped. ARKADAG was in contention started backing up going up the hill for the final
time. JUST A WHIM stalked the leader until the final turn, made her bid through the stretch only to fall at the last jump and was vanned off. BELAY started to
fall back on the backside for the final time and was pulled up before the second last jump and walked off. OCEANOGRAPHER trailed throughout, lost touch
with the field on the backside for the final time and was pulled up before the 8th jump and walked off.
