Footnotes
BUENISIMO broke inwardly and slowly, trailed inside early, made progress hugging the rail rounding the turn, came in and brushed the rail while trying to
avoid a puddle leaving the three-sixteenths pole, straightened out soon after, closed inside and was up near the sixteenth pole. CHIPSHAPE tracked the
pace in the clear in the four path, bid outside of foes in midstretch and finished willingly while outkicked by the winner. PARTY OF NO pressed the pace
outside of ROYAL BIZ in the three path, bid between foes in upper stretch, battled on through the lane but was outfinished. CONGRATS AGAIN came in
and bumped BRYTON'S D J into DEPUTY INDY at the start, raced off the early pace two wide, made progress in upper stretch, swung out widest leaving
the eighth pole and finished well widest. DUEL FUEL raced in range in the two path, bid nearing the eighth pole and flattened out. SETTE STELLE played
no factor while racing two wide. ROYAL BIZ set the pace in the two path and tired through the lane. FORMAL TREASURE chased the early pace three wide
and faded. DEPUTY INDY was bumped at the start then checked off heels soon after, saved ground and never threatened. KICK IT CHARLIE was outrun
while racing three wide. BRYTON'S D J was bumped at the start, raced four wide, retreated and was easing through the lane.

Footnotes
THINKABOUTIT stayed out in the track dueling inside DROPPED ANCHOR for a half-mile. opened up into the stretch and stayed clear under a mild drive.
PERFECT CUT eyed the battling leaders around the turn in the four-path, could not threaten the winner and was best of the others. DROPPED ANCHOR
dueled outside THINKABOUTIT to the top of the stretch, got shaken off and ran on to salvage the show. TAITA raced three to four wide, and was not a
factor. GRAND WISER moved out three wide on the turn, and posed no threat. HIGHJUMP CHARLIE broke slowly and was outrun. QUINTO SOL was
ridden along around the turn, and lacked a response.

Footnotes
TERRY'S DREAM set a pressured pace along the rail, edged clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. BIG BAD DIVA lacked early speed,
advanced two and three wide around the turn and rallied outside to gain the place late. LUISANA PRINCESS stalked the pace three wide, bid near the
quarter pole, was repulsed by the winner in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and weakened. IRAZU saved ground off the pace, angled out for the
stretch and lacked the needed rally. SPEIGHTSTER'S GOLD failed to menace while racing two wide. SWEET FELICIA chased the pace four wide and
faded. CRYSTAL COAST pressed the winner two wide and retreated through the lane. LIL'S KITTEN trailed well off the rail.

Footnotes
LAVI was outsprinted early, advanced around the turn four then five wide, caught NENITA from outside past the eighth-pole and drew clear. NENITA
pressed FIAMMA MAMMA from outside early, took over around the turn in the three-path, could not withstand the winner into the final furlong and held for
the place. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE raced two wide and failed to threaten. BELLA GIANNA stayed close three to four wide for a half-mile, and faded in the
stretch. FIAMMA MAMMA set a pressured early pace inside, and gave way approaching the stretch. R SEA SMOKE went wrong near the seven-sixteenths
pole, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
WALKOFF settled off the early pace while racing two wide, split rivals in upper stretch, struck the front near the eighth pole and just lasted. PALACE
KITTEN tracked the pace three wide around the first turn, edged closer four deep rounding the far turn, steadily gained through the lane and just missed.
DANVILLE saved ground off the pace, swung widest in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied for the show. THRESHOLD lacked
early speed three wide, made strong three wide move around the far turn, loomed boldly in upper stretch and flattened out. SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE set
the pace a bit off the rail, continued on the left lead, led to midstretch and tired. ALASTOR stalked the pace two and three wide and faded in the drive.
SWAGSATIONAL saved ground well back, hit the rail entering the far turn and never threatened. RELIABILITY was outrun while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
KATZ A DREAM was never far back, shifted to the three-path into the stretch, caught the leaders from outside past the furlong marker and moved clear late.
GOODBYE GABY bumped lightly with GOOD SHABBOS at the start, tracked outside early, engaged MY ASHLEIGH from outside into the turn, fought on to
the final furlong and was best of the remainder. MY ASHLEIGH vied for command inside BLESSING MEMORIES early, disposed of that one while being
hooked by GOODBYE GABY around the turn, weakened on the rail through the last eighth of a mile and saved a share of third. GOOD SHABBOS was
bumped lightly between horses at the start, raced three wide and was up outside MY ASHLEIGH to split the show. COZY CAFE swung four wide coming off
the turn, and made no impact. NOMBRE saved ground to the stretch, and failed to make her presence felt. BLESSING MEMORIES bumped lightly with
GOOD SHABBOS at the start, hustled up for the early lead outside, and retreated around the turn.

Footnotes
BIG THORN stalked the pace inside down the backstretch, angled three wide nearing the three-eighths pole, seized command leaving the quarter pole and
drew off readily while ridden out. FULMINI pressed the pace two wide, took a brief lead near the five-sixteenths pole, could not match strides with the winner
in upper stretch but stayed on willingly to be well clear of the rest. CASTLE KING lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn, angled out near the
three-sixteenths pole and was along for the show. LIGHT US UP chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. SEAZAN lunged at the start
then was in tight soon after, advanced outside down the backstretch, dropped back five wide around the turn and lacked a rally while passing some tired
horses in the lane. HOT BLOODED set the pace along the rail and gave way leaving the five-sixteenths pole. EL SICARIO was outrun inside.

Footnotes
ITSMYLUCKYGIRL tracked from close range four wide for a half-mile, reached the front from outside a furlong out and drew clear under pressure. SOLID
AS A ROCK sprinted clear early, showed the way in the two-path to upper stretch, proved no match for the winner but held for the place. BEAST OF
WILDWOOD raced in closest attendance to SOLID AS A ROCK three wide for a half-mile, and weakened in the lane. GRAN ETIQUETA broke slowly,
saved ground most of the way, and offered a mild response to land the last major share. TAKECHARGE MIRELLA raced four to five wide outrun to the
stretch, and improved past tired horses. LIL MISS HOTSHOT was no factor two to three wide. SALSA RITA stayed in range for a half, and tired inside.
BABY ICE raced three to four wide, and was finished approaching the stretch. MAJESTIC MAIARA saved ground into the stretch, took a bad step near the
eighth-pole, pulled up in distress and was vanned off.

Footnotes
THISSMYTIME prompted the pace two wide down the backstretch, drew off in the two path around the turn and widened under a drive through the lane.
STARSHIP NALA gave futile chase to the winner while racing two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and held second. R PREROGATIVE raced
three wide in midpack, moved into third nearing the lane and lacked a rally. HIGH ON GIN never threatened while racing three wide. LOVELY LUVY failed
to menace while racing three wide. CRUMB BUN steadily faded four wide. PICARA set the early pace along the rail and retreated around the turn. SWEET
HITCH HIKER hesitated at the start, raced two wide and was outrun. SAYONARA BABY was through early.
