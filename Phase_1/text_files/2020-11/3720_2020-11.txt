Footnotes
LOVEFLIESONWINGS sent to the lead and cleared from the rail, found herself always clear and won clear under steady urging in the stretch. VIDALIA
broke in and bumped inside rival at the start, stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, made steady ground on the turn two wide, kept on in between foes
in the stretch and surged well late to get up for second. AT THE MARGIN tracked leaders along the inside on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside
and into the stretch along the rail, rallied past rival for second midstretch and edged out at the wire. MAGICALCHIC bumped by outside rival at the start
chased outside of leader on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, drifted out slightly into the stretch into the three path, unable to sustain bid in the lane
and outfinished in deep stretch. SHE'LL TAKE CHARGE hesitated and came out slow, far back early along the inside, two wide on the turn and passed tired
rivals in the stretch. MILLIE JOEL stalked pace along the inside on the backstretch, stayed along the inside on the turn and lacked needed response in the
lane while being passed late. NAOMI FRALEY tracked leaders three wide on the backstretch, entered turn three wide and lacked and response in the lane.
LADY OF CHARLIE off slow and very far back early, never urged thereafter and coasted to the finish well back of the field.
