Footnotes
RB GAME OVER disputed the pace, moved clear on the turn, drew off into the final furlong and proved much the best under a moderate hand ride to win
ridden out. CONSIDER THESS was coaxed along off the pace, chased the winner on the turn and proved no match while able to safely secure the place.
LAPCOS BONUS settled on the outside, was urged along on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. BIG PURITY disputed the
pace on the outside of the winner, chased that foe on the turn and tired. WMA HOPE dropped well behind on the backstretch and failed to threaten. RB
WHISTLIN DIXIE tracked the pace on the outside, came up empty on the turn and retreated. GOLLY SHEZ HOT SV was urged along off the pace and
faltered. KD DERBY GIRL was ridden along towards the rear and also faltered.
