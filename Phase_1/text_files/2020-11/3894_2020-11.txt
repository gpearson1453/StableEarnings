upper stretch. ORBITING THE SKY chased along the inside to upper stretch fading late from the rail. LETSGETITPERFECT raced mid pack weakening to
upper stretch. MERENGUE hopped at the break, gave a mild move on the turn then flattened out in upper stretch. SI MAMACITA played no factor.

Footnotes
JONNY'S CHOICE set the pace digging in to upper stretch fighting off outside pressure there to win gamely. CUSTOM INFINITY went evenly surging on the
far turn, drew even abreast foe in upper stretch only to be turned away late. CLEANUP HITTER raced mid pack edging closer on the far turn, in range the
final eighth would finish evenly. MAJOR RIDGE lagged to upper stretch finding best stride after the fact. WE WILL SHINE stalked close up through the far
turn, extending to upper stretch would weaken. REVIVE AND RESURGE slow early improved past the others. THE CATMANCAN stalked through the far
turn then gave way in upper stretch. THE PREZ hustled along chased through the far turn wilting into upper stretch. BEING THERE gave way on the
backside. JOYEUX was always outrun.
