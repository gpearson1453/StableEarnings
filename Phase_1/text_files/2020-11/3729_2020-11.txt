Footnotes
ROUSING SLAMMER attended the pace outside of WALKING WITH DINO and two wide, responded when roused into the stretch, pushed away to mid
stretch and heled driving despite not switching leads. BRANANX chased the leaders to the turn, swung three wide, responded when set down for the drive,
could not catch the winner while edging away from the rest. WALKING WITH DINO contested the pace inside the winner, saved ground to the stretch then
was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. ACE AND KINGS stalked the pace early, raced three wide to the stretch but was outrun to mid stretch and did not
rally. KAZIC had no speed and was never a threat. MR. ARTISTIC broke a bit slow, hustled to chase the pace from the rail then was outrun to mid stretch
and weakened. TRAGICALLY HIP had no speed, saved ground but stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH had the best speed, set the pace inside to the stretch, edged away to mid stretch and held off REVEREND AL determinedly.
REVEREND AL The latter pressed the winner two wide to the stretch, responded when roused for the drive and closed gamely but too late. CONTINENTAL
UNION had no speed, was fanned four wide on the turn then shifted widest for the drive and closed belatedly. BLAISIN' EAMON was chasing to the turn,
saved ground to the stretch but could not make an impact in the drive. ICE OR FIRE also chased the pacesetter from between rivals in the two path to the
stretch then lacked the needed late response. SARNI tracked the pace to the turn, was three wide to the stretch but also failed to offer a late bid.
HYDROGEN had no speed and was not a factor.

BOOMCHICABOOM broke clean, cleared rivals and shifted in, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded in the lane and held driving. SIMPLY
PERFECT stalked the pace from the rail to the stretch then finished well in the late stages. LASTING LIGHT was outsprinted to the turn, shifted out into the
stretch, rallied to mid stretch then hung. VACAVILLE SPECIAL had no speed, was two then three wide to the stretch but could only pick off rivals in the
drive. CALIFORNIA COMET had no speed, shifted off the rail and was two wide into the stretch but also failed to threaten. MUCHO MACHO WOMAN
prompted the winner two wide to the stretch but was tiring in the final furlong. THUNDER WOMAN chased to the turn, was forced to swing five wide into the
stretch and came up empty. DIXIE PEGGY was bumped and took up shortly after the start and did not factor. ADULTING was rank inside rivals early and
taken out, raced three then four wide to the stretch but gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
ONE LAST TIME broke a bit slow and was outrun to the turn, made a stout bid to the stretch then shifted out, continued to respond and drove clear in an
impressive debut. IT'S MY HOUSE was chasing the leaders inside to the stretch, remained inside in tight quarters but gamely continued on for the place.
IMA RUMBLER attended the pace three wide to the stretch, responded to mid stretch but was weakening late. BIG ENDEAVOR hustled to contest the issue
inside IMA RUMBLER, was two wide and stayed on to mid stretch then was also weakening. RUNAWAY KRISTIN had no speed, raced off the rail on the
but could not threaten in the drive. MEETMEINCALI stalked the leaders two wide to the stretch, got oukicked to mid stretch and gave way. TRIBAL NATION
had no speed, was three then four wide to the stretch but was never a serious threat. I'M A BLOCKBUSTER pressed the pace to the turn, got outrun while
three wide to the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
EMERALD MAGIC attended the pace outside of TRISTAM SPEAKER, pushed to the front to mid stretch and held driving. ELECTORAL was outsprinted to
the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then finished willingly for second. TORPEDO AWAY had no speed, saved ground and gamely finished well
inside. CANNONBALL COMIN was chasing outside rivals, came four wide to the stretch then lacked the needed late response. ROMAN RUSH tracked the
pace to the turn then saved ground to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. TRISTRAM SPEAKER had good speed, dueled inside the winner to the
stretch but weakened in the final furlong. MISTER MOJO was also stalking early, raced three wide to the stretch but did not rally when asked. TOMAHAWK
TUESDAY had no speed, trailed three wide then showed a bit of interest late. MISSED THE BOAT stalked the pace, was between rivals and squeezed off
by ROMAN RUSH nearing the quarter pole, took up sharply and gave way.

HECK YEAH well placed off the leader to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, pushed to the front to mid stretch and held under steady urging.
BOTTLE OF SMOKE was outrun to the second turn, raced three then four wide while rallying to the stretch, swung widest for the drive and finished steadily
for second. PREMIUM FOREST had no speed, settled towards the rear to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch, rallied to loom a threat to mid
stretch then flattened out. HARMON settled mid pack to the half, saved ground to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. DESCARTES set the
pace to the second turn, was off the rail to the stretch, got overtaken by the winner in upper stretch and weakened. GREAT POWER stalked the pace for
five furlongs, was three wide to the stretch and lacked a closing bid in the drive. SUNSET DRAGUNN tracked the pace, was caught four wide on the second
turn and gave way in the stretch. RETURRAY chased the pace for a half mile, tried to respond four deep on the second turn but also gave way in the drive.
