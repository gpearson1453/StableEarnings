Footnotes
SPIELBERG stalked the speed from off the rail, closed in around the far turn and bid alongside PARNELLI at the quarter pole, dueled through the lane, had
the rider lose the whip just inside the eighth pole, battled gamely to the wire and edged the runner-up. PARNELLI set the pace inside, responded when
challenged at the quarter pole, dueled through the lane from inside and fought gamely to the wire. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY tracked the pacesetter from off
the rail, angled in and traveled a bit off the rail into the stretch and was along for the show. THE GREAT ONE chased two wide on the first turn then three
wide around the second, drifted out in the lane and lacked a response. FEEL THE BERNING unhurried in the beginning and moved to the inside, came
three wide into the stretch and proved no menace. BOLU reserved in the early going, raced outside a rival on the backstretch, went two wide into the lane
and was never a factor.

Footnotes
WAR PATH stalked in the two path early, moved up to apply pressure at the half-mile point, urged right-handed at the top of the lane then switch to the left
and drew clear clear. ON EASY STREET went three then two wide around the first turn, traveled outside a rival then between rivals into the second bend,
came off that turn three wide and finished willingly for second. KEYSTONE FIELD sped clear and angled to the inside, set the pace along the fence, held a
short lead over WAR PATH through the far turn and into the stretch, led to the eighth pole but yielded to the winner in the late stages and got outfinished for
the place. FRASARD (GB) traveled in the two path then angled five wide into the stretch and put in a mild late bid. JOHAN ZOFFANI (IRE) stalked from
inside throughout and never responded to urging. DIRECT LINE in range off the inside, went three wide into the far turn then angled out a path leaving that
bend and weakened in the drive. JUROR pulled early from between rivals, angled to the rail around the first turn, stayed inside to the stretch and never
made an impact.

Footnotes
BIG HOOF DYNAMITE broke out, floated out by rival at the seven-eighths pole and went five wide around the turn, entered the far turn three wide then
angled five wide and six wide in upper stretch, rallied and nailed rival at the wire. MOONOVERTHEBAYOU floated out into the first turn, settled off the pace,
went four to five wide around the far turn, collared rival at the eight pole, took control shortly after, led late but could not hold off the winner. RACE HOME
stumbled leaving the gate, went two wide into the first turn then angled three wide at the seven-eighths pole, chased off the rail up the backstretch, took the
second turn three to four wide and showed a mild rally to earn the show. BITTER RING HOME showed good speed from the inside, roused at the
five-sixteenths pole, headed by rival with a furlong to go and flattened out in the late stages. BLAME IT ON KITTY raced off the pace in the two path and
finished evenly in the lane. CAUSE AND EFFECT up close early, went two to three wide around the far turn and weakened. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY
tracked the pace from inside to the stretch and had little left in the drive.

Footnotes
FREEDOM LASS stalked the leader in the two path, entered the stretch three wide, closed in alongside the leader in the final furlong and dug in late for the
score. VIAZAR settled early in the two path, bid outside the leader at the half-mile point, gained command at the quarter pole, cleared GALLOVIE
approaching the eighth pole, battled with FREEDOM LASS in the late stages and finished gamely while unable to hold off the winner. CONSTANTIA came
away to an awkward beginning, unhurried in the early going, went two wide into the stretch and was along for the show. GALLOVIE (GB) set the pace along
the fence, met the challenge from VIAZAR on the backstretch, held a short lead into and around the far turn then relinquished the lead at the quarter pole
and weakened late. GOODTINGSCOMINPINK traveled three wide around the first turn and outside a rival, entered the stretch two wide and never
threatened. SECRET SQUARE saved ground into the lane and was always outrun.

Footnotes
CHOLLIMA dueled for the lead from the outside up the backstretch, pressed the leader around the turn, moved up on even terms once again and kicked
clear from rival in upper stretch then drew off through the final furlong. OUR ROMANCE tracked off the inside, went three to four wide around the turn,
angled out at the top of the lane and rallied for the place. IT'S A RIDDLE chased from inside to the lane and got outkicked for second. MAJESTIC
MOUNTAIN raced four to five wide around the bend and kept on for a minor award. RICKIE NINE TOE'S forwardly placed early, came off the turn three
wide and weakened. PALM D'ORO dueled for command from inside, inched ahead around the turn, then gave way in the stretch. MOREAVINO stumbled a
bit at the start, lagged behind the field, went two wide around the turn, drifted out through the lane and was never a factor. MISTY AT THE TOP tracked off
the inside, four wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch, drifted out at the top of the lane and came up empty. EXCESS COIL forwardly placed in the
early stages, dropped back on the turn and tired. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
PIZZAZZ chased three wide then moved up to challenge on the backstretch, took a short lead at the half-mile pole and dueled with HIGH CON to the far
turn, kicked clear at the five-sixteenths and drew away around the turn and remained clear under hand urging. IVY LEAGUE bumped at the start, chased off
the inside, went three wide into the lane, finished well but was not a threat to the winner. AVISSE pressed the pace from outside then dropped back to
chase at the halfway point, traveled two wide into the drive and finished evenly. LEIA MARIE stalked the pace from inside and never produced a bid. HIGH
CON away quickly from inside, set the pace under pressure then dueled with PIZZAZZ on the backstretch and into the far turn, lost contact with that rival at
the five-sixteenths, chased the winner into the lane and weakened. NURTURING bumped leaving the gate, traveled two wide then off the rail on the
backstretch, went two wide around the far turn and failed to rally. CONSTANTINA off slow to begin, trailed throughout and was always outrun.

POPULAR KID chased well off the rail early, bid four deep at the quarter pole, chased the runner-up through the lane, then re-bid late and nailed rival on the
line. AGAMEMNON in range early up the backstretch, bid three deep on the turn, gained command then moved clear pat the eighth pole, led through the
final furlong then shortened a bit late and got nailed by the winner. TIZHOTNDUSTY chased five wide into the stretch, angled out and summoned a mild late
bid to earn the show honors. FRATELLI pressed the leader from inside, vied with a trio of rivals leaving the turn then weakened in the final furlong.
OFFSHORE AFFAIR chased the early on, came off the turn four wide, drifted in at the eighth pole and kept on. BIG BARREL raced along the inside into the
turn, moved out into the two path, steered back to the rail near the eighth pole and also kept on through the final furlong. POLICY shifted in shortly after the
start, traveled near the back of the pack, came six wide into the lane and never threatened. I WILL NOT in range early, traveled three wide then angled out
near the three-sixteenths marker and flattened out. SHADY EMPIRE away quickest to take control, set the pace under pressure from the inside, vied
between rivals leaving the turn and gave way in the stretch. FOOTHILL went three wide into the lane and weakened. CAL'S GEM bothered early by outside
rival, lacked early speed, went four wide into the lane and was always outrun.

STRONGCONSTITUTION stalked near the inside, waited for room leaving the far turn, angled to the rail at the top of the lane, slipped through along the
inside, gained command near the sixteenth pole and held over the runner-up. HEYWOODS BEACH traveled along the inside early, swung four wide into the
stretch, angled further out in the lane, surged late and missed. LANE WAY tucked inside on the first turn, moved a bit off the rail on the backstretch, went
three wide into the lane, asked at the eighth pole, bid between rivals and got outkicked by the top pair. I'M LEAVING YOU stumbled and bumped from both
sides at the start, settled off the pace, entered the far turn three wide then angled out into the five path, took over past the eighth pole then flattened out in
the final sixteenth. LURE HIM IN bumped leaving the gate, trailed the field early, angled six wide into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and improved
position. GOALIE tracked from inside then taken off the rail on the backstretch, outside a rival on the second turn and got floated out by that rival entering
the stretch, and failed to find the needed rally. ROOKIE MISTAKE stalked outside a rival, bid thee deep at the quarter pole, took the led in upper stretch, in a
bit tight at the sixteenth pole and weakened late. MARGOT'S BOY bumped both sides at the start, in range early off the rail, lost path at the sixteenth pole
and steadied and could not regain momentum. DOMINANT SOUL broke out and bumped rival at the start, sped to the front and set a pressured pace, vied
for the lead from inside leaving the turn, lost command and faded through the final furlong. JAMMERS JUSTICE pressed the pace from outside, challenged
at the five-sixteenths pole, vied between rivals into the lane, bumped by rival at the eighth pole then checked mid-stretch and weakened.

GOLDEN IMAGE sped clear up the backstretch, inched away around the bend, drifted out in the lane and held safely. YOU'RERIGHT AGAIN bobbled and
bumped outside rival then bumped inside rival, chased three deep then three wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the place. MINOSO in range
early while outside a rival, took the turn four wide and held the show. KING PARKER bumped leaving the gate, raced off the pace, entered the turn five wide
then moved into the four path, chased five wide in upper stretch and showed a mild response to get a minor award. BEDROCK tracked off the rail, three
deep at the quarter pole and finished evenly in the final furlong. NEXT FLIGHT angled to the inside, raced two wide on the turn then angled out in upper
stretch and lacked a rally. TROMADOR lacked early speed, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch and was never a factor. BIG CHEDDAR stalked the lone
leader from between rivals, angled to the rail in upper stretch and weakened. NIETZSCHE bumped by outside rival at the start, went four wide into the turn
then three wide exiting, asked in the lane and gave no response. BABY GRONK saved ground along the inside, in tight and steadied at the top of the lane
and weakened.
