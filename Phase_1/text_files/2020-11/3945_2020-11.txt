Footnotes
MAXIMUS MIDANI stalked the pace, raced four wide on the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch then drew away while kept to his business. HARD STING
hugged the inner rail around the turn, swung outside near the three sixteenths pole then passed a tired rival at the wire. MARTINI LANE prompted the pace
three wide around the turn, gained a brief lead at the head of the stretch and faded late. DAPER'S DRINK , well placed in the four path between horses in
upper stretch, gradually weakened in the drive. ONE MORE NIGHTCAP chased the pace and was done turning for home. I AM IT , five deep on the turn,
faltered. GALLINIPPER showed speed inside horses, raced in the two path on the turn and faltered entering the stretch. FIND YOUR BOAZ trailed.

Footnotes
MISCHIEFS MODEL dropped in early and claimed a stalking spot, edged closer and took aim on the embattled leaders leaving the five sixteenths, got
through to the inside in upper stretch, spurted away under a drive in mid stretch then held sway while kept to task. AMATERASU , bumped at the break,
recovered and edged up early while angling in a few paths, chased outside a rival mid turn, swung four wide into the lane, straightened away and finished
with good energy to gain. MOONSAFE hopped outward at the break to be away a bit slowly, straightened and settled towards the rail, remained inside to
make a run in upper stretch but failed to seriously sustain the final sixteenth. COWGIRL NIGHT drifted in at the break and bumped with a foe, raced well
back early while saving ground, stayed towards the inside for the drive and finished with interest. RUN LAURA RUN sped clear early and set the pace off
the rail, took pressure from the three eighths to the quarter pole, drifted out near mid stretch and weakened late. CURIOSITY KILLS had a wide trip. LADY
CLAU stalked the leader three wide, bid to challenge leaving the far turn, forced the issue into the lane and weakened. GAVICHI broke slowly, settled off the
pace, came four wide for the drive, angled out late and failed to threaten. SHINY , towards the inside, came up empty. IRISH BRANDI lacked speed, was
under a ride saving ground into the turn and never really picked up the pace.

Footnotes
DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA sped to a two wide lead leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and eagerly pulled away while under brisk urging
in the drive. NEVER ENOUGH TIME saved ground on the turn chasing the pace, eased out to the two path entering the stretch, was no match for the
winner and held the place. NEEDS SUPERVISION saved ground on the turn while outrun, angled out in upper stretch, worked between horses and rallied.
SUGGESTIVE HONOR (ARG) raced along the inner rail around the turn and lacked the needed rally. LAST TRUE LOVE raced in the two path between
horses and in the stretch and failed to rally. TIMELY TRADITION , three wide chasing the pace on the turn, was fanned to four path turning for home and
gave way. S W BRIAR ROSE , five deep leaving the turn, was outrun. GIGGLING chased the pace two wide on the turn, was fanned to the three path
entering the stretch and gave way. ALISIO , three wide on the turn, floated to the four path at the head of the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
AIR TOKEN edged up under rating while saving ground into the turn, tracked patiently, eased out and worked between rivals approaching the stretch,
shifted out some, closed relentlessly under left handed rousing, dueled outside FRANCATELLI through the final yards and just got up. FRANCATELLI
advanced inside foes and gained a short lead heading to the five eighths, set a pressured pace under some rating, shook clear into the lane, wandered
outward once collared past the sixteenth marker, battled gamely but just could not contain the winner's charge. GOLDEN CANDY , taken to rate early while
not far back, gained between runners past the three furlong marker, came four wide with aim into the lane, gave willing pursuit but could only gain a bit in
the final yards. INFORMATIVE lacked speed, race two wide into lane, angled to the rail and churned on with interest. PIANZI broke a step slow, lacked
speed, raced three wide into the lane, angled out and had belated action. BRIGHT DAWN , urged along in the clear mid turn, angled out for the drive but
failed to menace. DREAMS UNTOLD , four wide stalking the leaders, was under pressure into the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and faded.
JOHNNY RITT prompted the pace three wide, applied more pressure mid turn, forced the issue into the lane then gave way. CAREY TIMES rushed up
between rivals early, pressed the pace to mid turn then gave way. PER STEWARDS RULING FOLLOWING A POSITIVE SAMPLE, AIR TOKEN WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND DEEMED UNPLACED.

Footnotes
HELLO BEAUTIFUL stalked the pace two wide under confident handling around the turn, was under some urging leaving the turn, swept to command in
upper stretch then drew away under vigorous rousing. REAGAN'S EDGE hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased out in upper stretch and rallied nicely.
LANDING ZONE , pinched back leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three wide, was fanned four deep entering the stretch and rallied mildly outside
horses. LADY ROCKET , lightly brushed at the start, dropped back leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn, was inside rivals in the stretch
and passed tired ones. BELLA AURORA saved ground around the turn, angled off the rail approaching the eighth pole and was not a factor. BOBBY'S
GOLDENGIRL chased the pace, raced in the two path on the turn and weakened. FLY ON ANGEL came in at the break, sprinted to the early lead, set the
pace along the rail and tired the final furlong.

Footnotes
WHERESHETOLDMETOGO settled in the clear and off of a hotly contested early pace, advanced under some rating while saving ground mid turn, angled
out and brushed with DAY THE MUSIC DIED when gaining four wide between rivals into the lane, shifted in when taking over past the three sixteenths, dug
in when meeting an outside challenge from LAKI in mid stretch, dueled under left handed rousing and was resolute to the wire. LAKI broke alertly then
drafted back allowing the leaders to go on past the five eighths, picked things back up past the three eighths, angled five wide heading towards the lane,
was fanned six wide into the stretch, straightened and ranged up to engage the winner in mid stretch, battled gamely outside that one through the final
furlong and just missed. BYBEE , off the pace, raced three to four wide in upper stretch, worked between rivals leaving the furlong grounds and churned on.
CHARGE TO VICTORY bobbled at the break, chased three to four wide between rivals, steadied when in a bit close near the quarter pole then continued
with effort to the line. ARTHUR'S HOPE dueled on a short lead from the half mile marker, ceded command past the three sixteenths then faded late. DAY
THE MUSIC DIED , off very slowly after having his head turned at the break, rushed up inside and gained a stalking spot into the turn, angled out, pursued
wide past the five sixteenths, was brushed by the winner entering the lane and weakened in the final sixteenth. COMPLETED PASS failed to menace.
STILL HAVING FUN broke a step slow, saved ground and lacked a bid. ZENDEN , unprepared for the break when having his head turned a bit, showed a
burst and moved to a slim lead in the opening furlong, dueled outside a rival through brisk fractions, stayed on willingly to about the three sixteenths then
weakened. EASTERN BAY , brushed at the break, lost ground five to six wide, raced in range to the quarter pole then gave way. An objection by the rider of
CHARGE TO VICTORY against LAKI for alleged interference near the quarter pole was not allowed. Objections by the trainer and rider of LAKI against the
winner for alleged interference in the vicinity of the quarter pole were not allowed.

Footnotes
HARPERS FIRST RIDE , urged from the gate to get position, edged up in the clear nearing the half mile marker and was poised as the leaders battled up
front, responded when given his cue past the three eighths, rolled up four wide to bid outside rivals nearing the lane, forged clear in upper stretch, drifted in
a bit in mid stretch then held firm while kept to task. CORDMAKER rated close up while saving ground, awaited room behind the duelers past the five
sixteenths, swung four wide entering the lane, straightened and finished with good energy. NAME CHANGER settled in mid pack while saving ground, took
closer order past the three eighths, angled out and circled five wide into the stretch but could only muster up a mild response. TOP LINE GROWTH stalked
the duel while outside a rival, bid three wide between runners nearing the lane, vied briefly, stayed willingly to about the sixteenth marker then faded.
FOREWARNED lacked speed, raced towards the inside in the drive and had a mild kick. MIDNIGHT ACT , off the pace, raced two to three wide past the
five sixteenths, shifted out in the drive but lacked a solid finish. MONONGAHELA lacked speed, saved ground into the lane and failed to menace. BAL
HARBOUR , along the rail, got engaged in a duel soon after the start, carried that battle to the head of the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths
and weakened. WAIT FOR IT disputed the pace outside BAL HARBOUR, fought on while between foes past the quarter pole then succumbed heading
toward the eighth pole. KUKULKAN (MEX) , off the pace and removed from the inside, made a slight run leaving the three eighths, came five wide for the
drive, faltered soon after, was eased in the last furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
RUMSON RALLY , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, raced wide on the turn, angled to the eight path in upper stretch, closed outside foes,
led near the sixteenth pole and drew off. KORCZAK chased the pace around the turn, angled to the three path approaching the stretch, gained the lead
near the quarter pole, drifted in near the eighth pole and was no match for the winner. LUDICROUS MODE lacked speed, raced inside horses in the stretch
and rallied mildly. GREEK PRINCE raced in mid pack between horses most of the trip and failed to rally. COOL MAN CLETUS worked between horses
most of the race and weakened. APPRAISED lacked speed, raced in the five path between horses in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. RESIDENT
LIBERAL , five deep on the turn, floated to the seven path in mid stretch and gave way. SEATTLE RIC showed speed along the rail, disputed the pace
through fast fractions and tired. JERICHO MARSH hugged the inner rail around the turn and gave way. CHUCK'S DREAM disputed the pace two wide and
faltered.
