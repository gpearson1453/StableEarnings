Footnotes
DEACON chased the three rival duel through the turn while in the three to the four path, swung into the lane from the five or six path and four wide, bid from
mid-track and inched up late to just get it done. ARABIAN STORY settled off the pace while along the inside, cut the corner and benefited when others
swung wide, moved up from the two or three path while drifting out a bit then was just outfinished at the wire. MY MAN BECKETT set the pace while in the
two path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path with a diminishing advantage, dug in inside the eighth pole while between rivals, drifted out
a couple of paths between the eighth and sixteenth pole and was outfinished. MOON DOG SPOT pressed the pace three wide through the turn, came into
the lane four wide, remained on near even terms for the lead until late and weakened. ITASCA was off awkwardly and settled well behind the field,
continued on the inside through the lane and never was a serious threat. FINAL DELIVERY pressed the pace two wide and in the three path through the
turn, continued on near even terms inside the eighth pole, was put in tight between rivals and eventually shut off near the sixteenth pole. UGO was never a
factor while in the three path through the turn. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF #4 FINAL DELIVERY, #2 MY
MAN BECKETT WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED SIXTH FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE SIXTEENTH POLE.

Footnotes
MYSTICAL JUSTICE was in the three path through the first turn, dropped closer to the inside into the far turn, tracked the pace through the far turn, came
off the inside to bid two wide into the lane, hooked up with the leader inside the eighth pole and slowly edged up. SNAPASELFIE pressed the pace two wide
into the far turn, took over in late turn, continued with a clear lead into the lane, was pressed by the winner after the eighth pole and grudgingly gave ground.
HITCHED set the pace while along the inside, could not keep up with the top two into the lane but kept on well to be clear for the show spot. DYNAH MAC
chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, was well placed into the lane then lacked a bid. BACKHAND was in tight early and settled to the back,
was asked for more entering the far turn, advanced through the three path into the lane and passed a couple tired ones. CANDY EMPIRE chased the pace
from the three path and tired. LULU'S TROLLEY was outrun while near the inside.

Footnotes
SERENA BECK chased the pace from the three or four path through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, hooked up with two others inside the
three-sixteenths pole, dueled to late and edged up. GOLDEN COMMAND vied for the lead along the inside of two other rivals through the turn, continued on
near even terms with an eighth to go then could not stay with the winner late while winning the duel for the place spot. AN INDIANA NIGHT vied for the lead
four wide early and three wide through the turn, continued on near even terms inside the eighth pole then yielded late just missing the place spot.
GINORMOUS was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, angled into the six or seven path and offered a belated rally from mid-track. D D SEVEN
THIRTY vied for the early lead two wide and between rivals, settled off the pace to chased through the turn and into the lane and lacked the needed bid.
SUPER JEN was checked between rivals early, raced along the inside and was never a factor. ELUSIVE JUSTICE was bothered at the start, settled to the
back and was never in it. HELP ME OUT vied for the lead early while two wide and between rivals into the turn then was empty through the lane and
eventually collapsed galloping out and was vanned off

Footnotes
PEGASUS ON THE GO stalked the pacesetter from the two path through the turn, bid into the lane while still two wide, inched to the lead outside the eighth
pole then cleared and widened to the wire. INTERFERENCE set the pace through the far turn while near the inside, dueled with the winner into the lane,
yielded to that one outside the eighth pole then kept on well to be clear for the place spot. MEMPHISINMAY was in the three to the two path through the
turns and moved up while not a serious threat to the top two. RUSHED chased the top two while in the two or three path, bid three wide into the lane, looked
to be a serious threat when straightening in the lane then suddenly flattened out. BAHNKE was along the inside into the far turn when never far back, asked
for more near the three-eighths pole an weakened. CACAHUETE was never a serious factor while racing near the rail through the turn and into the lane.
BIZERK chased the pace from the three path into the backstretch, continued to be a serious contender into the far turn then was done approaching the
quarter pole. CRAFTY SPECTOR was outrun while in the two path through the far turn. CONQUEST STORMY raced in mid-pack but not far back while in
the four path, continued in the four path into the far turn and was done before mid-turn.

Footnotes
SUCH GREAT HEIGHTS set the pace while four wide into the turn, continued well off the rail while maintaining a short lead, swung into the lane from the
three path while gaining a clear advantage then widened through the final eighth. MIDNIGHT KARMA unhurried while near the inside through the turn,
waited behind a wall of rivals coming into the lane, got clear near the three-sixteenths pole and moved up near the inside to settled for second best. ONLY
REWARD'S pressed the pace while along the inside, could not stay with the winner into the lane then yielded the place spot late. TWISTED EMOTIONS
pressed the pace along the inside into the lane then weakened. NAUGHTY FACTOR was in the six to the four path through the turn and never was a factor.
OVER THE BLUES was close up from between rivals through the turn while in the three then the two path and faded after entering the lane. BROKE
FINANCING made no impact while in the two path through the turn. TAPIGAL pressed the early pace five wide entering the turn then steadily faded.

Footnotes
KINETIC SKY set the pace while near the inside and under pressure into and through the turn, came into the lane with a short lead, was repelling two
challengers when joined by another inside the eighth pole, came out under left-handed urging and bumped runner-up, came out twice more in deep stretch
to bump rival while still under left-handed urging and just lasted. EL SOBREVIVIENTE settled behind several while in the three path into the turn, moved in
the five path into the lane, was four wide outside the eighth pole, came in a couple of paths after clearing all but the winner, bumped with that one,
straightened and was bumped two more times in deep stretch and just missed. FAST BOB chased the pace from the three path, bid three wide in late turn
and into the lane then weakened after straightening. MOUNTAIN KING stalked then pressed the pace through the turn then tired in the stretch run.
PARROT HEAD tracked the pace along the inside into the turn then lacked a closing response. CINNAMON BAY was never a factor while in the two path.
XIETELEHUAS was outrun while in the two path. HAGANS MARKET was done early while saving ground. AFTER AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #6
EL SOBREVIVIENTE AGAINST THE RIDER OF #7 KINECTIC SKY, #7 WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1ST AND PLACED 2ND FOR INTERFERENCE
DURING THE STRETCH RUN.

VAPOR POINT led early between rivals, then vied between the pair to the wire and lasted under steady handling. FIVE STAR COLONEL vied in the three
path and was outfinished. COMPLEX JUSTICE vied inside of foes and was outfinished. BENNETT bore out start, raced inside and had no bid. MUSTY RED
took up at the start, then ran evenly. ARCH DREAMER stalked in the three path, bid at the quarter path, then faded in the stretch. FLINT was off awkwardly
and was bumped at the start. SPIN THE BOW was not a factor. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, BENNETT WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FIFTH FOR
INTERFERENCE AT THE GATE.
