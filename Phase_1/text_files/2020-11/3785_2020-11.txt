Footnotes
SARATOGA BEAUTY stalked the earlier pace and kept aim in the five path of the turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and drew away the final furlong.
PAUL'S PLUNDER stalked the pace from the three and four paths, dueled close in the four path of the turn, then held on for second while no match for the
winner. KEEPER IN SPITE stalked the earlier pace while in tight toward the inside, angled out with a bid nearing the head of the lane, steadied between
horses then altered course mid-stretch and recovered stride to gain on the runner-up. LOOKIN FOR CANDY was hustled along at the rail to set the early
pace and contested the edge through the turn, but gave up the lead mid-stretch and flattened stride. RAPIDASHQUEEN raced well off the pace, angled out
leaving the turn and showed little more. ELOQUENT LADY raced well off the pace toward the inside, drifted on the turn and proved to be no factor. RED
HOT KITTEN gave chase but faded steadily. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Paul's Plunder, lodged by the rider of Keeper In
Spite, though, found no warrantable infraction.

Footnotes
NATTY BEAU sprinted to a clear lead to set the pace and dug in under steady stretch encouragement to hold on well. CHARLIE POTATOES stalked the
pace through the backstretch and bid in the four path of the turn, but couldn't close on the winner and had to settle for second. YOU ARE AWESOME
settled off the early pace inside, then bid at the rail into the turn, but, flattened stride inside the eighth pole. GAMING JACK raced off the pace outside,
rounded the turn about the five path and showed little further. LITTLE LION saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase at the rail into the turn but
showed little further. BANANAS ON FIRE stalked the pace through the backstretch then picked up the chase into the turn, rounded the turn about the three
path and weakened. MANKLIN CREEK raced well back through the backstretch then eased outward on the turn, entered the stretch about the six path and
showed little further. NOTORIOUS REY was not a factor. MAID THE JOURNEY stalked the early pace, gave chase about the five path of the turn, then
weakened.

FRAUDULENT CHARGE stalked the pace through the backstretch and raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, took the lead into the stretch,
drew clear a furlong away and widened with steady handling. HEARTFUL saved ground off the early pace, bid into the turn and angled to the six path
leaving the turn, then dug in to take second the final yards. NOT ON MY WATCH rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the top of the lane,
gave up the lead at the rail leaving the turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole and was nipped from second the final yards. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL
settled off the pace through the backstretch and faded in the three path of the turn. SALAMINA stalked the pace through the backstretch, gave chase into
the turn then faded leaving the turn. DANGER ZONE settled off the pace and off the rail, gave chase into the turn but weakened into the lane.
HOWSAFEAREMYCOLORS saved early ground then angled to the six and seven paths of the turn. ITALIAN DRESSING settled off the pace, rounded the
turn in the three and four paths and showed little more. KELLY GREEN was not a factor.

early pace outside, rounded the turn about the four path and finished evenly to pass rivals. UTTERLY ENCHANTING saved ground off the early pace, bid in
the four path into the turn, eased out into the lane but showed little further. SUNDAY IN L B C chased the pace three wide, drifted to the five path on the turn
then weakened the final furlong. LA BELLE DE COURSE chased the pace through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, angled four wide into the
stretch then weakened the final furlong. MOON OVER VICTORIA saved ground racing well off the pace. YIRA chased the pace through the backstretch and

SEVILLA SANGRIA was hustled to the front and rated the early pace inside, then dug in under steady stretch handling to hold on. MISS PHILLY DILLY
chased the pace through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path, eased just outside the winner leaving the turn, dug in under steady
encouragement and was gaining slowly. FANCY PRINCESS raced off the pace outside, rounded the turn about the seven path and finished well outside.

VICTORY settled off the pace in the four and five paths then finished evenly. STEELY BAND raced well off the early pace, angled to the seven and eighth
paths rounding the turn and finished evenly outside. BODEMAX settled off the pace and rounded the turn in the three and four paths then flattened stride
