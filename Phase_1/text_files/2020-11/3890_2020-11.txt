Footnotes
WAKE UP JOE broke readily, was urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing into the bend, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to midstretch,
then turned back MONGOL BULL to go well clear late under firm encouragement. The latter broke sharply, prompted the pacesetter in early stages, tracked
just off that rival through the turn, shifted out to loom outside the winner nearing the three sixteenths marker but proved no match late. BOOM BOX tracked
off the second flight between foes racing to the turn, angled five wide racing through the stretch and edged rivals for a share. J Z'S LAST TRY settled into
stride off the inside early, angled inside entering the turn, then shifted six wide leaving the furlong marker while finding some late stride. ELUSIVE FORCE
tracked off the second flight along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and improved position between foes to the end. SAMURAI
MIKE tracked the leaders three deep in second flight racing into the turn and faded between rivals in late stages. HE'S DANN GOOD, a step slow into stride,
was guided to the inside early but never gained contention. ONE WAY HOME tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing into the turn but
came up empty in the drive. CREAL WONDER came through close quarters in the opening stages while being urged to a forward placing along the rail,
tracked just off the leaders into the turn and gave way into the lane. SUNNY'S STORM, slow into stride, failed to menace.

Footnotes
UNBURNT, a step slow into stride, came under some pressure in the opening stages to gain terms with the pacesetter nearest the rail prompting that rival,
skirmished for command into the turn, then edged forward following a long drive to gain a clear advantage in time under left handed pressure.
CLASSOFSIXTYNINE broke sharply, forced the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, pressed the issue to late stages but was just
outfinished. RONAN settled well off the second flight racing to the turn, split foes just off the inside in late stages and edged a rival for a share. DIAMOND
STELLAR tracked the leaders while angling inside to race as part of the second flight into the turn but faded in late stages. POLLY WAR CRY, urged to a
forward placing three deep leading the second flight on a narrow margin to the turn, tracked the leaders between foes on the bend and gave way.
RENOVATION tracked the leaders four, then three wide as part of the second flight racing into the turn but gave way after a half. SILVER N LACE, reserved
last racing well off the inside early, failed to menace.

BOBBIE TOO TOO bobbled slightly at the start but recovered quickly to gain a narrow advantage between foes, dictated the pace racing a bit off rail into the
turn, shifted about under pressure in the closing stages but held U. S. CURRENCY to the end under energetic handling. The latter tracked just off the
pacesetter along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to gain terms with the winner nearing the wire
while only second best. POLAR'S GRACE, brushed at the break, then a bit outpaced in the opening stages, saved ground through the turn and came
through close quarters in the final stages to edge a rival for a share nearing the wire. TEMRIK settled well off the leaders racing to the turn, angled inwards
racing into the stretch while gaining some position between foes but was just outkicked for a share. OZETTE tracked just off the first flight racing four wide
into the turn and faded in late stages. SIMPLY FAST settled last outside foes racing to the turn, then angled five wide in upper stretch while making no real
impression. LIPLINER was rated just off the first flight racing to the turn, split foes on the bend to lodge a brief, three wide racing into upper stretch but
quickly emptied out. LOVINHERWASEASY, urged to a forward placing three wide prompting the pace racing into the turn, gave way entering the lane and
was gathered up late.

Footnotes
IHADADREAM, reserved in early stages while being guided to the inside, saved ground to the far turn gradually gaining position, angled out three wide in
upper stretch and rallied to wrest the advantage in time under firm left handed encouragement. SHOBIZ STAR sped to the fore while angling to the inside,
dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, held sway into the stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner late. GO FOR
SHERRIE, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, weakened between foes in late stages. BEAR TRAPPE angled to the inside
tracking off the first flight, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. BEHIND ENEMY LINES, off slowly, was settled last to the far turn
and passed inside tiring rivals late. RICH E Z tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was fanned five wide into the lane but
offered no rally. COLOMBARD, urged to a contending position three wide early, tracked off the first flight outside a rival to the second bend, shifted out four
wide racing into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
HOT PEPPER SUZIE broke readily to race on terms with the first flight four wide between foes through the backstretch, shifted inwards racing into the bend
prompting a rival, took over nearing upper stretch, edged away leaving midstretch and held several rivals under pressure. CAROLINA BEAST, in touch with
the first flight three wide between foes in the opening stages, conceded some position to track just off the leaders racing into the turn, then gained three
deep between foes in the closing stages to challenge for command nearing the wire while edging a rival for the place honors. HENRYS GIRL tracked just off
the first flight between foes in the opening stages, raced five wide on the turn to upper stretch and continued willingly to the end to challenge outside the top
pair late. AMAZING ANNIE, pinched back at the start, settled last while angling to the inside racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and steadily
gained along the rail in the closing stages. MS KELA TIME, shuffled a bit at the start, settled between foes off the second flight racing to the turn, then split
foes three wide in the closing stages to gain some position. REND LAKE BABY, forwardly placed five wide in the opening quarter, continued in pursuit of the
leaders to bid three deep nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. G CITY WARRIOR settled outside foes in early stages, was fanned six wide into the
lane and gained some position while making no real impact. RARE ACTION ATTACK, caught in tight quarters at the start, settled outside foes and raced
wide throughout while proving no threat. SHES GOT ME GOING tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the
lane. EMILY BUG tracked off the second flight along the inside to the turn but lacked a closing response. NEW RULES, urged inside rivals disputing the
pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, was going erratically nearing upper stretch and emptied out. WARY CARRIE flashed brief pace between
foes but emptied out early.

Footnotes
MALPAIS, prompted to gain a position between foes in second flight, was held up in tight quarters when losing his path momentarily to COLONEL KLINK
nearing the turn, angled to the rail entering the bend tracking just off the leaders, came through when presented an opening to challenge for command
racing into upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. TRAPPE VALLEY angled inwards to track just off the second flight racing through the
backstretch, gained position between foes racing through the turn, shifted four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prove best of the
others. EL ASESINO tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to prevail for a share.
MEDAL OF FACT was urged to the lead outside foes, then angled inwards to set the pace a bit off the rail racing into the turn, but gave way entering upper
stretch. AND HE'S LOOSE, caught in close quarters and steadied hard in the opening furlong, settled between foes racing to the turn, then split foes into the
lane to improve position. COLONEL KLINK, urged to prompt the pace along the inside, switched out sharply pursuing the pacesetter racing into the turn but
gave way entering the lane. AMERICAN HERITAGE tracked off the first flight three wide racing to the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and gave
way. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn but offered no rally. WHENTHEDOVESCRY, caught in in close
quarters, was held up outside foes early and failed to menace thereafter. DOLLAR BLUE, caught in traffic and held up early, never gained contention.
MEXICO MEMORIES settled near the inside in early stages and proved no threat.

Footnotes
DEVILEYE was settled well off the leaders while angling to the rail in the opening stages, saved ground to upper stretch, gathered late momentum racing
past the furlong marker, then tipped just off the inside to split foes and wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. HIDE THE DEMON, forwardly
placed four wide in opening stages, dropped off the leaders nearing the turn, angled sharply to the inside approaching upper stretch, steadily gained on the
leaders while shifting out three wide leaving midstretch but was just outkicked while prevailing for second. THE TABULATOR stalked just off the pacesetter
along the inside in the opening stages, split foes on the turn to press the issue into upper stretch, gained the lead between calls late but just failed to contain
the top pair. SIR ANTHONY settled last along the inside racing to the turn, swung out six wide racing through the stretch and made some belated progress.
NUCLEAR OPTION, urged to the lead along the inside in the opening stages, dueled for command inside foes racing into the turn and gave way in late
stages. WHAT'S UP DUDE, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the leaders between foes in the opening stages, steadily faded into the lane.
CARLOS L., urged between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, emptied out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
LIL BIT TIPSEY, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, was prompted to challenge entering upper stretch and wore down
AMERICAN HOLIDAY in time under brisk right handed pressure to narrowly prevail. The latter broke readily, was urged to the lead along the inside, dictated
the pace to upper stretch and grudgingly resisted to the wire. SEATTLE TRAIN angled to the rail in early stages tracking the leaders as part of the second
flight, saved ground through the turn, then shifted out four wide nearing midstretch to prevail for a share late. IZE DISCREET ROSE came through close
quarters at the break to gain a position tracking just off the leaders along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch while
being prompted to challenge but soon flattened out. EDISTO ISLAND angled inwards to track the leaders between foes in second flight just off the inside
racing into the turn, was fanned five wide nearing midstretch and lacked the needed late kick. MAY BE SUSPECT, held up avoiding close quarters early,
angled to the inside racing into the turn but passed only tiring rivals. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN settled off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to the turn
and failed to menace. PRAISEM, urged to a forward placing three wide racing through the backstretch, gave way early. WILDWOOD SCAT settled outside
foes racing six wide early and proved no threat. HAL'S MISCHIEF was settled four wide racing to the turn, then was fanned six wide into the lane while
proving no factor. LOVE BROKE THRU tracked off the leaders three deep racing into the turn, was fanned six wide in upper stretch and gave way.
