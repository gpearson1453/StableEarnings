Footnotes
MCCAIN pressed the early pace, gained command through the far turn and and drew off in the final stages to be well clear under strong handling. JOYCEE
HAZ PIZZAZ stalked the pace, moved up four wide into the upper stretch but was no match for the winner in the drive. PATRIOT GAME dropped back early
on, moved up three wide just past the eighth pole and showed good late interest. TRUSTYOURINSTINCT stalked the pace from the outside, raced three
deep through the stretch and had no final winning bid. DETERMINED FOCUS settled off the early pace, raced three wide around the far turn and failed to
have a response. MAGICAL MARRIAGE dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. ON THE LIPS saved ground and
never was a serious threat. PRINCE PERE set all the pace along the inside and tired readily the final quarter of a mile.

CONJECTURE pressed the early pace, gained command around the far turn, raced three wide at the eighth pole and held gamely to be clear under strong
encouragement. FOGGY DREAMS stalked in the early stages, moved up four wide into the upper stretch to challenge but couldn't match strides with the
winner late to finish second best. MORTAL STORM was allowed to settle early on, raced towards the inside through the stretch and had not enough late.
GLITTERING JUDY set all the pace from the outside and weakened in the drive. WHY NOW stalked the early pace, raced four wide at the quarter pole and
had no response. GRACE ISABELLA settled off the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. SIDEREAL was unhurried
early, saved ground and never threatened. MARKET MONEY was off a step slow and never was involved. MARGIE'S MONEY dropped back early and
failed to respond. SPLASHERSTOWN failed to sustain a bid.
