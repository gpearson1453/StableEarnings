Footnotes
DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER stalked from outside, moved to engage on the turn three wide, took the lead by the quarter pole, drove clear and was kept to the
task. PREMEDITATED LILY tracked from inside, shifted out four to five wide coming past the quarter pole, was no match but second best. LEBRON JANE
prompted the pace from between runners early, went two wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. MICHELLE WHO stalked from outside and was
carried out a bit into the turn going four to five wide on that bend, ran on evenly in the stretch. TIZ TENACIOUS broke just a step slowly, steadily advanced
inside running on evenly in the lane. UPTOWN JERSEY GIRL was encouraged forward to pursue the leaders in behind and inside a rival, appeared to be
getting out and was taken hold of into the turn, came out a bit in upper stretch and ran on. STORMY GALE vied inside rivals but just off the fence into the
turn, steadily weakened. LA GLORIA broke just a step slowly, moved in and saved some ground on the turn but was never a threat. L M SPARKLE was a
bit reluctant to load, chased briefly from outside and came up empty.

Footnotes
SHINNY stalked the pace while racing inside, moved up along to the rail to challenge, assumed command, drew clear and held well. TRUST N PRAYER
was unhurried early, saved ground, advanced inside to the turn, closed off the rail, didn't have enough late and settled for place. SHARK HUNTER was
rated into the backstretch, saved ground, angled out on the turn, was carried six wide, bid and hung. DANDY VAN was unhurried early, put in a steady effort
and improved position. THE KID IN SYD was hustled along to set the pace to the second turn, swung wide, tired and faded through the stretch.o.
AIREDALE was never far back, rallied four wide on the second turn, had nothing left for the drive and dropped back. TIZ A SLAYER went five wide on the
first turn, stalked the pace and was through after a half. TU SOLO TU raced in the second flight between horses and was through after a half. WAR PAINT
BRAVE was not a factor.

MINNIE ME HA was slow early, advanced around the turn, closed willingly, got up late and won going away. HOT N PERTY pressed the pace, rallied on the
turn, bid willingly to contend for the lead and was outclosedl. DEVON'S CHOICE set the pace, responded when challenged to duel and was unable to
sustain her bid. GOOD FOR NOW was never far back, bid inside on the turn, loomed a threat, was steadied near the sixteenth pole and faltered. FEISTY
HALO lagged early, went six wide leaving the turn and lacked a rally. STEVE'S BABE DOLL was checked along the backstretch, bid three wide on the turn,
had nothing left and gave way. TOWER WAGON was outrun in an even effort. MCMISSY was not a factor. CARRY ON DIXIE passed tiring rivals.
CURRENTLYMYPROBLEM was not a factor. ATTILA'S TATTLE was hustled along to press the pace inside, tired entering the turn and gave way. CURL
was not a factor.

Footnotes
FORGOTABOUTME set a pressured pace, drew off leaving the turn for a clear lead and held safely under mild urging. DECK HUMOR pressed the pace,
challenged between horses on the turn, fell back and was no match for the winner. ALMOST A STORM stalked the pace, bid between horses on the turn,
fell back, leveled off and settled for show. MR. DIGGER raced in the back, closed steadily and gained late. SONG OF LAURA raced close to the pace,
dropped inside, angled back out leaving the turn, bid and came up empty. DOM STRAIT improved position in an even effort. HUSH'S STORM was not a
factor. KEEP ON ZENON ON got away well, had brief speed only and steadily faded. MCCLASSIC was outrun. YANO'S WAY was never far back, raced
outside, was carried out entering the stretch and gave way.

HARKING pressed the pace to the turn, assumed command, drew off and extended her lead under urging. ORNAMENTAL IRON broke sharply, advanced
to the turn, bid four wide to loom a threat, dropped back and was no match for the winner. CHASIN LUCAS raced close to the pace while racing off the rail,
bid inside, altered course in the upper stretch, lacked a late rally and settled for show. ZAMARA pressed the pace, went five wide entering the stretch and
gave way. LUCK BE MINE set a pressured pace to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. MIDNIGHT EMMA dropped inside, showed speed to
the turn and gave way. FLYIN FALYNN lacked a response in a wide trip.

sprinted clear to set the pace to the second turn, fell back and hung late. PRINCESS NICOLE failed to respond. CONNIE'S LINDA was checked entering
the first turn and again entering the backstretch, raced outside and stopped. MCFANCY was through early and stopped. The stewards' posted an inquiry
