Footnotes
BARNACLE BILL pressed on the inside, angled out on the far turn off the rail, drew off in the stretch while being ridden out. NANTAN was bumped at the
start and was allowed to settle, rallied in the stretch and was second best. POKER GAME raced mid pack early, rallied in the stretch with a mild bid and was
best of the rest. Z J WINS raced wide and was no threat. CLYDE PARK contended for three quarters, then weakened. ROBERT'S PRINCE set the pace for
three quarters, then gave way. SALT MINE raced five wide and was no threat. UNBRIDLED BOILER stumbled on the first turn and was no menace.
COTTONWOOD CANYON raced mid pack, saved ground and tired.
