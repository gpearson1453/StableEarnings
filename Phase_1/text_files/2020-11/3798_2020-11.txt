Footnotes
DANCE LIGHTLY advanced the rail on the backstretch, came out three wide between rivals for room entering the stretch, took over from the outside just
inside the final sixteenth and quickly drew out late. MARY ELIZABETH broke in the air, advanced outside early, moved to a short lead in the three path on
the turn, was bumped in early stretch, lugged in under right hand whip, bumped DIAMOND MOON leaving the furlong grounds then couldn't contain the
winner. SOLO TRY lagged inside into the turn, swung wide into the stretch, finished fast outside and was up for the show. LIL SURVIVOR took to the
outside early on the backstretch, moved closer in the three path outside the winner on the turn then flattened out. DIAMOND MOON ducked out sharply
leaving the gate, made the early pace in the two path, bore out under left hand whip into MARY ELIZABETH entering the stretch, was bumped by that one
leaving the furlong grounds and tired. FOXY'S EDGE wasn't far back between rivals into the turn then tired.

lead before going a furlong, stayed out from the rail while making the pace to the stretch then stopped. LITTLE MISS JULIA raced the three path and failed
to matter. BAYANNE was outrun. BRAZILIAN SYMPHONY broke in the air while slow from the gate then was wide and outrun.

LOVE pressed the pace two wide into midstretch then weakened. SHOWER THE PEOPLE wasn't far back three wide to the stretch and lacked a rally.
OBROTHER ITSYLVIA bobbled slightly leaving the gate, raced wide into the stretch and made up ground between horses. FUDGE swung wide into the

MIAMI STEVE broke slowly, advanced inside early then tired. GLOBAL NATION raced two wide between horse and stopped.

Footnotes
MY BERNIE rallied the rail around the turn, angled to the outside in early stretch then ran clear nearing the final sixteenth. LORD SIMBA had his head turn
to the inside at the break, went in the air in the gate, left several lengths behind the field, rallied three wide around the turn and finished fast between horses.
THAT L D K IS MINE raced four wide around the turn and lacked a strong closing response. NO HITTER took command at once, stayed out from the inside
around the turn and weakened in the lane. BLACK JACKET was no factor. STOLEN LOVE went in the air at the break then wasn't a factor. MASSEY HALL
pressed in the three path outside the early leader and tired. MAGRITTE was close up outside into the turn then tired. ULTIMATEENTICEMENT was outrun.
SPECIAL SEASON (GB) was outrun.

HUNTIN'THEHOLIDAYS was unhurried while wide around the first turn, rallied the four path around the final turn, ran clear in early stretch and widened
under urging. LUCKY LOVER BOY settled inside, rallied the rail into the stretch and outfinished the others in an even finish. MICKEY T pressed in the three
path outside the early leader, moved to a short lead midway on the final turn then faded from between horses in the lane. CUTTER HELM raced the three
path, swung wide into the stretch and lacked a strong closing. FEDERAL DOMINANCE wasn't far back along the inside, came out entering the stretch and
lacked a rally. LINDA'S NEKIA lagged badly early then failed to menace with a belated run. EARLY RETIREMENT made the pace in the two path to the
stretch then stopped. QUENCH MY THIRST briefly had position in the three path then stopped. TOP HAT VOYAGER was outrun.

Footnotes
WATCHTHEBOURBON was well placed in the three path, moved to command from the outside in midstretch, edged clear in late stretch then held.
BAGWELL was content to lag, rallied the three path around the second turn and closed a gap in the final yards. BOARDWALK BOB moved to a short lead
from between horses nearing the end of the backstretch, held on to midstretch then faltered. E T'S WARRIOR made the pace along the rail for about five
furlongs, remained prominent into the final furlong then weakened. PHIL THE BANKER lacked a closing response. MONYINTHEBANKSEY gave his best
three wide on the final turn then tired. DA KING AND I broke in a tangle, moved up wide on the first turn and was finished after a half.
