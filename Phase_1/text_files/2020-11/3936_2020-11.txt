Footnotes
CHARLIE FIVE O sparred for the top two to three wide, had already inhaled the leader a few strides up the road when asked for more spinning into the
stretch, responded to kick away to a commanding lead, then ventured onward in the final seventy yards with the pilot utilizing a mild hand ride. SINASHACK
worked out a tuck from just off the rail at the top of the turn, angled three wide for the stretch run, proved no match. PACIFIC LEGEND dove over to the rail,
rode it until the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, got maneuvered to the outside springing from that station, was approximately three wide a furlong
later, went on to secure the show. AMERICAN RULER stalked the pace from path three, commenced the stretch one wider, gave way. MAGNIFICENT
CHROME taken hold after stumbling in at the start, pursued the front runners from path two for nearly a half, got moved out four wide heading home, made
no impact. RISKY WOODS along the outside, travelled four wide on the turn, got driven six wide spinning onto the head of the stretch, appeared to mainly
improve position. ROMANTIC MAN chased the pace three to four wide, was set down crossing the midway point on the turn, came five wide into the stretch,
gave out. JUDGE BERN sluggish on the backstretch, slid over to the inside route, stayed put until the end of the bend, strolled four wide into the lane
without an offering. STRETCH THE TRUTH disputed the pace from the inside until the shadow of the quarter pole, faltered. MISTER J T sighted sliding onto
the rail nearing the conclusion of the backstretch under a brisk hand ride, tipped out three wide entering the stretch, came up empty. LOST MY VOWCHER
climbed while proceeding along the backstretch early, raced two wide on the turn, cut the corner into the lane having never made its presence felt.

Footnotes
ITSAKEYPER two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, advanced from the three-eighths to issue a challenge in hand nearing the quarter pole, took
over command and swung three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, drew off under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat and
held safe to prevail. AVA K'S GIRL brushed the near side stall at the start, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside
through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, closed well through the final furlong to threaten the aforementioned
foe late but was ultimately staved off. MAGICAL ROMANCE chased along the inside, got let out taking the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a mild
kick to secure the show honors. TUMBADORA tracked the pace just off the inside in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
three wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. COREY SCORES coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide until tucked inside
into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and offered up a mild bid. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH chased five then four
wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and passed tired rivals. DREAM CHASING four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed
along three furlongs from home, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and made no headway. ALL OVER THE MAP hustled from the start, showed the
way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths as ITSAKEYPER advanced to issue a challenge, yielded the front near the quarter
pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. ABBY NORMAL chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, got coaxed along at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and offered no response. SYZYGY chased three to four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five
wide for home and made no impact.

FORZA DI ORO patiently tracked the pacesetter from the pocket, was put to a drive cutting the corner into the stretch, tipped towards path two to be outside
the one to catch in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, forged to the front, then kicked away smartly. MONDAY MORNING QB moved up under his
own power to establish the top, carved out the pace from along the inside route, accompanied by RALSTON from the outside, got roused entering the

Footnotes
HAWAIIAN NOISES hustled from the gate to establish the top, was switched over to a rating hold after accomplishing the mission, got rated along showing
the way, shadowed by MAC'S REVOLUTION from the outside, got overhauled by the aforementioned rival during the run around the second bend, cut the
corner into the lane, chipped away at the deficit springing from the eighth pole, completed his comeback inside the sixteenth pole then held on late to
preserve the decision. MAC'S REVOLUTION attained a prominent position, was in hand pressing the issue from the two path, needed no urging to take
over after departing the backstretch, went into the stretch, waited until the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker before getting called upon for more, tried to
dig in, relinquished a short distance beyond the sixteenth marker, salvaged second. SHALAKO kept watch on the pace towards the inside route, angled
three wide entering the stretch, narrowed in en route for show honors. THIS CAT CAN FLY strung out four wide on the clubhouse bend, was slightly closer
to the inside on the subsequent one, got shifted out into path five for the drive, improved position. CALCULATED RISKER parked out five wide on the first
turn, resumed its pursuit from path three after entering the backstretch, tipped out into path four for the stretch turn, folded. DYNAMAX PRIME underwent a
three wide journey until the end of the second bend, got sent out into path six from upper to midstretch, failed to fire. SUCCESSFUL SAINT three wide early,
made it into path two prior to reaching the conclusion of the stretch, got steered out four wide stepping onto the top of the lane, backed away.
AUTOSTRADE rode the rail until the quarter pole, went four wide into the lane and retreated.

coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, inched away under a drive holding well to the finish to prevail. SUBSIDIZE
coaxed from the gate, chased four paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the turn and advanced on the front
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear for the place
honors. ALL MO two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, kept on to procure the show
honors. JAILBREAKER chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route
into upper stretch and weakened. ASK NEAL four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn put to coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and made no impact. RUGGED UNION broke in at the start and was corrected, strode green along the inside
in behind rivals before tipping out to the two path into the turn, tipped out three to four wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and tired. MOONSHININGBRIGHT broke a half a beat slow, then shied in reacting to the breaking inwards RUGGED UNION and conceded
about three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three wide coaxed along from three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
NEVER SURPRISED established the top shortly after entering the main course, glided over to the inside route once sufficiently in the clear, this occurring
during the first stages of the run around the clubhouse bend, settled down after pulling a bit on the bit earlier, led the way, tailed by HARD LOVE from the
outside, stepped onto the top of the lane towards path two and was given his cue, kicked away to lead by its largest margin by the start of the final furlong,
squandered some it thereafter, but held sway. HARD LOVE stalked the winner from path two, got roused for the drive home, shifted a bit closer to the rail
early during the stretch run, finished willingly but got staved off. TAKE PROFIT kept watch on the winner from the pocket, quickened when let out a notch,
angled approximately three wide spinning into the lane, saw its brief display of interest fizzle out, saved the show. SCARLETT SKY pursued the front
runners at or near the two path, commenced the stretch slightly wider, lacked the necessary response. CATMAN along the outside, took up the chase two
wide during the opening phases, travelled three to four wide on the far turn, while just to the inside of the loose rival on the far turn, altered inward after
coming into the stretch, failed to fire. ROYNE reluctant to load, chased the pace primarily from the two path until the end of the bend, went into the stretch
about four wide and backed away. BREADMAN appeared to get clipped by the soon-to-be-riderless COUNTERFEITCURRENCY after being squeezed at
the start, underwent a two journey, tipped out wider for the drive, never made his presence felt. RUN CASPER RUN came out, making solid contact with
BREADMAN, was momentarily steadied with the loose foe in the vicinity, coming up to the finish line for the first time, rode the rail, got swung out three wide
for the drive, had no offering. COUNTERFEITCURENCY inward springing from the start, bumped with BREADMAN, stumbled after seeming to clip that
opponent's heels, losing the rider in the process, was eventually apprehended by an outrider and walked off the course. Following a Stewards' inquiry
focusing on the start, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

KANSAS KIS four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off
the inside for home, took over command straightened away, dug in under a drive under threat through the length of the stretch and held on gamely to score.
GLASS CEILING chased along the inside down the backstretch, tipped four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to
five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive surging late but missed at the end. CENTER AISLE four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened in the late stages. SAY MOI hustled from
the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch
and weakened in the late going. CRITICAL VALUE chased inside briefly before tipping out to the four path, tucked three wide through the turn coming under
a ride three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. UNDINE coaxed from the start, raced forwardly placed just off the
inside before advancing to take command near the nine-sixteenths, showed the way through the turn coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, took
the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened. FOREVER CHANGED chased along the inside down the backstretch
and then two to three wide through the turn coaxed along from midway, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. JA'S MALIBU hustled
from the gate, led early on flashing brief speed, got headed near the nine-sixteenths, began to stride awkwardly into the turn and retreated through the bend
growing detached at the tail of the field, went four wide for home and was eased through to the finish, then walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
TURNED ASIDE off a half length the quickest, remained forwardly placed, sat perched from path three, as the widest of three, vying for command, inched
up when ready during the final stages of the run around the bend, had already emerged as the clear leader when switched over to stronger handling deep
into the furlong grounds, edged away then dug in with good determination to prevail. EL TORMENTA pursued the pace from the two path, angled five wide
into the stretch, straightened away and rallied for the place. TRUE VALOUR (IRE) tracked the trio of front runners contending for the top while taking the
inside, swung out three wide for the drive, failed to make any headway in the last eighth, but stayed on for the show. THERAPIST away a length the tardiest,
took up the chase two wide on the turn, shifted out wider and wider after entering the stretch, was in path seven for the final furlong rallying for the last major
check. MAXWELL ESQUIRE cut over to the rail, rode it for nearly a half, got maneuvered into path six from upper to midstretch, rallied mildly. ARCHIDUST
two wide onto the turn, got sent out into path four exiting it, flattened out. BATTLE STATION saved ground until the end of the bend, tipped out into path two
for the stretch run, lacked the necessary response. LONHTWIST chased the pace from path two, had no rally. HOLLYWOOD TALENT put to some urging
shortly after the start, sparred for the top in path two from between rivals until upper stretch and gave way. SAYYAAF pulling a bit on the left during the initial
stages, was along the rail fending off a pair of foes from the outside, gave in to the pressure early during the stretch run and faltered.

MUTAMAKINA (GB) tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled from just off the pace, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, paused
straightened away before angling to the rail roused, had TRAIPSING drift off the inside under a near sided stick and rallied up the inside with a good kick
through the final furlong briefly tussling with that rival albeit barn mate before taking command in the last jumps to prevail. TRAIPSING broke in at the start
bumping WEGETSDAMUNNYS into ELIADE, established the front and showed the way under rating through sensible moderate splits settled into a
comfortable rhythm and rating kindly, continued to marshal the field through to nearing the quarter pole as rivals got busy in behind, took the inside route
into upper stretch roused for the drive, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, drifting off the inside slightly under a near sided stick at that station, dug
in under challenge tussling with the aforementioned foe before being overtaken in the final strides to the finish while safely along for the place honors.
DELTA'S KINGDOM forwardly placed three wide through the first turn, tracked just off the inside from just off the pace, tipped out three then four wide
through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive offering up a mild kick to secure the show
honors in the very last jump to the finish. ELIADE (FR) brushed at the start by WEGETSDAMUNNYS due to pressure from TRAIPSING breaking inwards,
tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket, was taken in hand off the heels of the leader six furlongs from home when spying some daylight and
pulling briefly on the bit, tipped to the two path three furlongs out, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole looking to take first crack at the leader, spun
just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive keeping on the same pace through to the finish and was outkicked, then got nailed at the end for the show
honors. THEODORA B. two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
stayed on one paced through to the finish improving position to the wire. WEGETSDAMUNNYS got bumped at the start by TRAIPSING, who broke inwards
and in turn brushed ELIADE, settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, tucked to the rail three furlongs from home, came under coaxing just past
the five-sixteenths, angled out four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. ENGLISH AFFAIR saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under
a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. WITH DIGNITY three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at
the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and had no kick. BEAU BELLE two to three wide in reserve in closest aim of the leader through the
opening mile, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. PRETTY POINT two to three wide in pursuit
from the near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. HUNGRY
KITTEN settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under urging five-sixteenths from home, went seven wide into upper stretch and was
unable to make an impact. SIBERIAN IRIS (IRE) saved ground near the rear of the field, came under a drive five-sixteenths from home, spun three wide into
upper stretch and never got involved.
