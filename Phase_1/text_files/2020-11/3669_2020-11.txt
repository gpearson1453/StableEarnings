Footnotes
UPTOWN GEORGIE set the clear pace, drew off while inside on the turn, responded well in the stretch and proved much the best under strong urging. ON
THE VERGE chased the winner, went two to three wide on the turn and safely secured the place. WMA NORTH WIND was urged along off the pace, saved
ground on the turn and lacked the needed response while clearly best of the rest. LIKE MOULIN ROUGE bumped hard with a rival at the start and was off a
bit slow, angled in early then moved up under urging, went three wide on the turn and tired. RB RATH was urged along in the front half, dropped back near
the half-mile pole, went four wide on the turn and capitulated. AA DBUSTER was urged along towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, moved out
inside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. WMA FLINTSTONE bumped with a rival at the start and was off a bit slow, went six wide on the turn and
was no factor. OZSTRA ORZEL settled well off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn and showed little. WMA FIREBALL bumped hard with a
rival at the start, was urged along on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, went five wide on the turn and faltered. PER RULING #31901
FROM THE TEXAS RACING COMMISSION, UPTOWN GEORGIE WAS DISQUALFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
