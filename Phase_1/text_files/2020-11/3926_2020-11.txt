Footnotes
WINNING ROMANCE was hustled to the lead, set the pace while off the inside, went around the turn in the two path, responded well when asked for her
best into upper stretch, drew off under a drive into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand ride late while much the best. TECATE TIME was
carried out at the start, settled on the outside, advanced four wide when roused on the turn, made a bid outside of the winner coming to the quarter-pole but
proved no match while able to get the place. LOULEIGH broke a half-step slow, moved up to race just off the pace, dropped back and lost position while
inside early on the turn, shifted three wide later on that bend, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while just able to get the
show. SQUOX broke out at the start, settled on the outside, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was asked in the three path on the turn, came four wide
into the stretch and weakened then missed the show. MISS NITAP tracked the pace down the backstretch, started the turn in the two path, dropped to the
rail before the five-sixteenths then was asked and came up empty. STREAMER broke a step slow, settled at the rear of the field, was urged along while
three then four wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MAX PANDOWDY went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, rounded the far turn in the three path while in dead aim of the leaders,
took the advantage when ready at the three-sixteenths, edged clear into the final furlong and held under steady urging. GOLD ACCOUNT was carried out at
the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked while three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and finished with
good energy but was too late while clear for the place. PHARAOH'S KITTEN bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, moved in while going to the
front, set the pace on the inside, was asked under heavy threat on the far turn, lost the lead near the three-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive into the
final furlong and weakened while clear for the show. EXPENSIVE bumped with a foe at the start, went three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the
outside, was urged along passing the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the far turn, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and tired. NO
KA OI broke out at the start, went three then four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the seven-sixteenths, went four wide
on the far turn and lacked the needed response. FIAT LUX was hustled from the start, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, was
urged along late on the backstretch, dropped back while inside on the turn and had nothing left. ROGER'S WORLD broke a touch slow, went two to three
wide on the turns and was no factor. DOWLING was off slow then angled in at the rear, checked while eager on the inside of a foe coming to the
seven-eighths then shifted three wide, moved to five wide later on that bend, lagged at the rear, dropped in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the far
turn and faltered.

drawing away into the final sixteenth and proved much the best while eased up late. FIFTY PROTECTION settled off the pace, went two to three wide on
the turn, remained under some restraint while just behind a foes heels late on that bend, was hesitantly ridden in upper stretch then roused between horses
into the final furlong and safely secured the place. WAR SAVVY bumped with a rival at the start and was slow into stride, spotted the front several lengths,
was urged along off the pace, raced inside on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive at the three-sixteenths and got up for the
show. CAJUN CANNON steadied briefly early, raced towards the front under urging, moved out near the half-mile pole, went four wide on the turn and tired.

spotted the front several lengths, raced well back in the field, went four wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch then was carried out and failed to
threaten. HIGHLAND CREEK lost his action when his path was taken by SMITTYS PATRIARCH early and steadied, chased the pace, went around the turn
in the two path and came up empty. K T'S JILTED GROOM was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch then
was carried out and had nothing left. YOUR TIME'S COMING broke awkwardly then was bumped on both sides, spotted the front several lengths, went
around the turn in the two path and was no factor. BALLINONABUDJET bumped soundly with a foe at the start and spotted the front a couple lengths, went
three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and also was no factor. CAPTAIN ZIGGY bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along on the
