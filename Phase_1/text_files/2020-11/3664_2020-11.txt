REAL KEEPER dueled inside KUDA HURAA to the quarter pole then met RAMONCITA LIGHT at the furlong pole and survived the prolonged duels.
RAMONCITA LIGHT stalked early, had her bid three wide into the stretch to gain a short lead but was outfinished by the winner. FAMILY TRIPS lagged
early, raced three deep on the turn and closed strongly to mid stretch then lost some of her punch. KUDA HURAA dueled outside into the stretch and
weakened. FINAL DEMAND saved ground and failed to rally.

SURPRISE FASHION lacked early speed, saved ground into the stretch, eased out, rallied and was up late. COIL TO STRIKE stalked the pace from off the
rail, led in the stretch but could not hold the winner. ACCORDING TO PLAN set the pace into the stretch and weakened. LOOK AT MY HOOVES lacked
early speed, raced four wide on the turn, finished well from the middle of the track then was seriously injured after the race and had to be vanned off.
CHANGING IMAGE showed little. TRES CHIFLADOS stalked early but gave way while three wide on the turn. BEL'S BLESSING prompted the pace to the
stretch and stopped.

going away in full stride. BETTOR TRIP NICK set all of the pace to the upper stretch, could not match srides with the winner but helf the rest. ULTIMATE
BANGO settled, raced three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. NO LONGER SILENT pressed the pace two wide and weakened. SQUARE

Footnotes
UPO took back off MANY ROSES early but pressed thatd rival into the lane, dueled through the drive and just got up. MANY ROSES was hustled for the
lead and gained the rail into the first turn, set all of the pace but was tagged in the deepest stretch. UNLAWFUL ACT settled early, raced four wide on the
second turn and finsihed in a mild rally. UBER STAR was unhurried two wide, remained just off the rail on the second turn and was gaining in the lane.
MAJOR KONG lacked a solid rally. SUNNY SPOT showed little. SIX POINT RACK raced close up early but gave way whiile three wide on the second turn.
PERFECT COME BACK had no response.
