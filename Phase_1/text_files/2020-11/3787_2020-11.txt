gaining late. AMPLIO ESQUEMA was herded outward at the start and settled off the pace, closed four-wide on the far turn then finished evenly. LETTER
ROLL was away slowly and settled in mid pack, chased from the rail on the far turn and was all out through the stretch. DAMA ELEGANTE, away slowly and
rated off the pace, closed mildly on the far turn but picked it up in the stretch and finished gamely. SHANGHAI BOUND settled off the pace, was hustled
three then two-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. AMBITIOUS PRINCESS settled in mid pack, was hustled angling inward from three-wide
to the rail on the far turn but evened out in the final 16th. SIMPLE SOUVENIR broke outward and settled off the pace, raced five then four-wide through the
clubhouse turn and three then two-wide on the far turn and failed to menace. IN PURSUIT broke outward but sprinted to a long lead, set the pace, hit the
wall and came back to her rivals early on the far turn, was eased in the stretch, crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
LEAVE IT WITH ME took the lead quickly, allowed a rival to her inside to go, recaptured the front around the turn, put that stubborn rival away and was
immediately tackled by the eventual show finisher in upper stretch, eventually putting that one away and needing the wire late to hold off a closer to her
inside. TWOCANKEEPASECRET got over to the rail with a deft ride before the turn, was in behind the leaders turning for home and went around a fading
pace horse in mid stretch, getting back to the rail by the seventy yard pole and getting to the winner late but running out of real estate. TOURIST
ATTRACTION lost her path at the start when a rival to her inside broke out, advanced up the inside to sit in behind the early pace pair, angled out into the
three path at the quarter pole and bid for the lead in mid stretch, still at the winner's flank at the seventy yard pole but hanging late. PEMBERLEY off the
pace early, circled four to five wide on the turn and was widest turning for home, coming resolutely through the lane without changing leads, particularly well
in the final seventy yards. SLASHS RED DIAMOND trailed after a sixteenth of a mile, rallied between rivals on the turn and came into range in upper
stretch, going around a tiring pacesetter before levelling off in the final seventy yards. ROSA'S SOUL broke out at the start, came up the inside to lead down
the backside, was trying to get out on the turn but was pinned in by the eventual winner, tiring down the lane, losing positions in the final furlong.
SARCASTIC LADY settled off the pace and along the rail, rallied mildly into upper stretch but was outrun from there. SILVER SUNRISE between rivals and
chasing down the backside, began to drop back late on the turn and the rider was up in the saddle for most of the stretch. ONLY BELIEVE threw her head in
the air at the start and broke out, stalked three to four wide until mid turn when the brakes came on, dropping back from that point. HAUTE was between
rivals in mid pack, fading from mid turn to the wire.

Footnotes
DASHI forced the pace, bid into the turn, dueled, led into the stretch, widened when asked and finished under a brisk hand ride. STORMY VISION settled
off the pace, was hustled from two-wide and the rail on the turn then rallied gamely inside. THIS ROUND'S MINE stalked the pace, was hustled along the
rail on the turn, launched a determined drive but evened out in deep stretch. FRAME THIS settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn, rallied
between foes but failed to menace. FROST DANCE forced the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn then lacked a closing response. ANITA GRIGIO
stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn then finished evenly. ECHO IN THE FOREST was pinched back and steadied leaving the gate, was
hustled three-wide then two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to be a major player. TWOMANYSHOTS, rated in mid pack, closed five-wide
on the turn but lacked a rally. BLAZING BOURBON pulled to a short lead, was under pressure on the backstretch, entertained a challenge entering the turn,
dueled, chased into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ZOYSIA broke outward and bumped ROLLING SLOAN, stalked the pace, closed late turn, bid upper stretch and drove clear then held sway under steady
handling. BOATLOADOFNERVE settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied gamely. MUSTN'T
GRUMBLE held a short early lead, was hustled clear on the turn but was joined upper stretch and gave way grudgingly in the final furlong. FRENCH
CHARM raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn then chased gamely to the end. GO GIGI GO GIGI GO raced in mid pack, rode the rail on
the turn, was blocked at the top of the stretch but a seam opened quickly and she rallied inside. YOU CANT CATCH HER settled in mid pack, was hustled
two-wide on the turn then finished evenly between foes. GET OFF MY TAIL settled off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn then rallied mildly
outside rivals in the stretch. BENEVIDA, in striking range, was hustled from the rail on the turn but lacked a closing response. CHEEKYLICIOUS broke
slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn but lacked a rally. ROLLING SLOAN, bumped at the start, led briefly then forced pace on
the backstretch, stayed up close on the turn but offered no response in the stretch.

Footnotes
MY SUGAR PIE stalked the pace, came along the rail and two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, gained the lead in the final 16th and finished
under a hand ride. TOTALLY PERFECT stalked the pace, raced three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, was blocked in the final furlong but altered
course and rallied gamely. SAVVY'S SISTER led early, dueled briefly, drew away a bit on the turn, set the pace, was passed in deep stretch and lost the
place position on the wire. VALLEY GIRL raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn then rallied outside. JOAN'S CHRISTINE stalked the pace,
chased three-wide into the stretch then evened out late. BEAT THE RUSH stalked the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn then rallied gamely outside.
SENORITA UNO broke awkwardly then settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn and showed some interest in the stretch. PETITE AMIE
hopped out of the gate, closed to mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn then finished gamely but was no threat in the stretch. SICK SOCIETY
was herded at the start, settled off the pace, closed from the rail and two-wide on the turn but never reached contention. KEEP YOUR SILENCE, in striking
range, was hustled two-wide then from the rail on the turn but had no closing response. RASPBERRY WILD settled in mid pack, was hustled into the turn,
backed away past mid turn and lacked a rally. CHEETAHRA raced in mid pack, was hustled five-wide on the turn then evened out in the final 16th. FINE
LADY broke outward and was steadied, settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but lacked a rally. FLATOUTONAMISSION moved
up and dueled on the main track, dropped back late turn, was eased, crossed the wire and walked off.
