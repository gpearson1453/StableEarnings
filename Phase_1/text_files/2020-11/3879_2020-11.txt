Footnotes
SPURN hesitated a bit at the break, stalked the early leaders down the backstretch, moved up four wide around the far turn, came in a bit into the upper
stretch to race in the two path and held gamely late under strong encouragement. A jockey objection by Entry time was filed against Spurn for interference
in the upper stretch and stewards ruled no change. JUBA'S FANCY vied for the early lead along the inside and finished second best. NO CHANGE dropped
back early, raced along the inside through the far turn into the upper stretch, angled to the three path through the drive and closed in well late. THAT'S FOR
SURE was hustled early, raced four deep through the stretch and had not enough. ENTRY TIME stalked early on, raced in tight quarters in the upper stretch
and weakened late. STRINGFELLA raced five wide into the lane and never was a factor. MISTER DEEKS was hustled along from the outside to vie for the
early lead and tired while racing four deep. CRISTIANO BOY dropped back early, raced five wide past the eighth pole and never was a factor.

Footnotes
CAMPY CASH was unhurried early, moved up four wide at the eighth pole and finished well to be well clear under steady handling. BRIDGING THE GAP
set a fast pressured pace along the inside and was no match for the winner in the drive. LADY STORM stalked the early pace, led narrowly nearing at the
eighth pole, raced two wide and weakened. LIES AND SCANDALS was allowed to settle early, raced three deep through the lane and had no response.
CAMERON STREET was slow early on, raced three wide at the eighth pole, improved her position but was not a serious threat. DUBAI WAS LIT settled off
the early pace and failed to have a response. COACH RUBE pressed a fast pace from the outside and gave way. HOT POSSEBILITY saved ground and
never was involved.

LONGSTORYLUCY was slow in the early stages, moved up five wide through the stretch and finished well to be clear under steady handling. MANDY set
all the pace from the outside and was no match for the winner in the drive. PRINCESS PENELOPE was unhurried early, moved up four wide at the eighth
pole and showed good late interest. SUNFLOWER ROSE stalked the pace, raced along the inside and had no final winning bid. COURTESY SHUFFLE
stalked the pace, raced three wide in the stretch and had no response. DYNAMIC UNION settled off the early going, raced four wide into the upper stretch
and never was a factor. JEAN GREY dropped back early, raced seven wide into the upper lane and never threatened. JET SETTIN LADY failed to have a
response. THEDEVILMADEMEDOIT failed to sustain a bid. KIM'S PET pressed the early pace and tired readily.

inside and weakened in the drive. SASSY KING was unhurried early, raced five wide into the upper stretch to improve his position but didn't have enough.

stretch and never was a factor. CHARITABLE SPENNY raced up close early and failed to sustain a bid. DISCOVERED pressed the early leader and gave
