MUCHO rated off of the pace in the two to three path around the turn, commenced a rally while shifting five wide turning for home, then sustained that
determined charge outside of foes through the lane to drive past the leader inside the final sixteenth. WILLISTON WAY rallied in the five path and outside of
foes through the turn to produce a four wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole, forged an advantage from inner foes in upper stretch, held that advantage to
the sixteenth pole, but was surpassed by an outer oncharging foe approaching the wire. EXPLORER stalked three wide, bid for the lead at the quarter pole
as MUCHO ranged up along side, but was outkicked by that foe in upper stretch, then kept on to secure show. BIG MONEY MIKE cleared off early on, set
the pace along the inside around the turn, but was headed by foes in upper stretch, then gave way through the final furlong. UNMOORED lied close up
along the inside early on, stalked around the turn, but chased from behind the leaders through the lane and failed to produce a bid. GHOUL (BRZ) tracked
from midpack in the three to four path around the turn while inside of WILLISTON WAY, but was outkicked by that foe approaching the quarter pole, then
flattened out in midstretch and weakened. HIDDEN RULER chased two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace at the three furlong pole, and
faltered turning for home. POWER END saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. MANIACAL raced far off of the pace in the four path around the
turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL settled far off of the pace, advanced in the three path around the bend before swinging to the seven path turning for home, took aim
on ESKENFORIT in upper stretch, forged an advantage from that foe approaching the furlong pole, and held sway from his inner counterpart to the wire.
ESKENFORIT rallied in the four path around the turn, produced a bid for the lead while drifting to the six path passing the quarter pole, drew off in upper
stretch while being chased by BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL, but was headed by that foe approaching the furlong pole, dug in to resist to the wire, but was second
best. MONEY FOR MISCHIEF was slow to get going, trailed the field far off of the pace in the three path around the turn, swung to the eight path in upper
stretch, and rallied willingly outside of tiring foes. CARTE BLANCHE settled off of the pace along the inside, tipped to the three path at the three furlong
pole, then to the five path at the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by outer foes passing the quarter pole, chased them through the lane, and failed to
menace. CANTRELL HILL stalked two wide, tipped to the four path at the five sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by outer foes at the quarter pole, chased
thereafter, but bumped LONELY PRIVATE at the furlong pole, then again at the sixteenth pole. LONELY PRIVATE prompted the pace three wide, vied
around the turn, but gave way to outer foes in upper stretch before taking bumped from CONTRELL HILL at the furlong pole and the sixteenth pole. MO
ZONE stalked along the inside, but was shuffled back behind MARGEE THUNDER turning for home, and failed to make an impact. MO'S MOJO vied for the
lead two wide and between horses, forged an advantage at the three furlong pole, but weakened in upper stretch. MARQUEE THUNDER broke inwards,
then pulled forward to set the pace along the inside, but was headed by a pair of foes at the three furlong pole, and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
PALIO FLAG was off a step slowly, stalked along the inside and from the pocket around the turn, tipped two wide at the quarter pole as OCEAN BREEZE
spurted away, rallied determinedly to wear that foe down approaching the wire, and won the photo via a head bob. OCEAN BREEZE vied along the inside of
LOADED, show the way around the turn before shaking clear from foes passing the quarter pole, but was tested by PALIO FLAG in the late stages, clung to
an advantage gamely approaching the finish, but was nailed on the wire and lost via a head bob. GERRI B stalked three wide, but failed to keep pace
between foes at the three furlong pole, shifted five wide turning for home, and stayed on to repass tiring foes in the late stages. GOULDING tracked from
midpack four wide, advanced around the turn to make a three wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but was repelled by the inner pace setter
approaching the three sixteenths pole, then drifted inwards while tiring at the furlong marker. LOADED vied two wide outside of OCEAN BREEZE, stalked
that foe around the turn, but drifted to the three path at the quarter pole, which allowed for racing room for the eventual winner, then faltered thereafter.
CHAMPAGNE HORIZON trailed the short field in the two to three path around the turn, swung six wide turning for home, but failed to mount a rally.

Footnotes
PRINCESS GRACE bobbled a bit at the start, stalked outside of POSITIVE DANGER, vied outside of that foe into the far turn, forged an advantage from
that rival at the five sixteenths pole, then drew off in upper stretch, and held firm through the final furlong. PASS THE PLATE settled off of the pace,
advanced in the three to four path around the far turn to bid for place passing the quarter pole as the leader kicked away, forged that position in upper
stretch, and chased the leader home while proving second best. HOW IRONIC trailed around both turns, swung five wide passing the quarter pole, and
rallied willingly outside of tiring foes. STUNNING SKY rated off of the pace around the first turn, advanced outside of foes down the backstretch to stalk the
pair of leaders three wide into the far turn, but failed to keep pace while getting outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch, and faded. WITEZ advanced from
midpack to stalking position down the backstretch, then saved ground around the far turn, but failed to produce a bid. POSITIVE DANGER set the pace
along the inside, clung to an advantage from the eventual winner into the turn, but gave way to that foe at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened.

Footnotes
HONORIFIQUE stalked three wide, vied around the turn, forged an advantage in hand at the quarter pole as ROOKERY ranged up alongside, but repelled
that foe in upper stretch, and drew off passing the furlong marker. ROOKERY tracked from midpark three wide, advanced in the four path around the turn to
bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but was repelled by an inner foe in upper stretch, then just held pace from an inner and an outer foe on the wire.
MINETTA settled far off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, then rallied through the final furlong, surged in the closing stages, but just
missed place while just getting up for show. EMPRESS CATHERINE stalked two wide, vied between horses and inside of HONORIFIQUE around the turn,
but failed to keep pace with that rival passing the quarter pole, kept on through the lane, but was nailed on the wire by an outer surging foe for show.
TABOR HALL lied forwardly placed along the inside around the turn, but chased the leaders through the lane without producing a bid. D'ORO FOREVER
was off slowly, trailed the field down the backstretch, advanced mildly in the four path around the turn before swinging to the six path turning for home, then
passed tired foes without threatening. HIGH FASHION tracked from midpack in the two to three path and between horses around the turn, but failed to
menace. MYRTLE IRENE bumped the gate and was off slowly, then saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. GRACE'S SECRET stalked along the
inside early on, but steadily faded into and around the turn. AMBER WAVES lunged outwards and bumped a foe at the start, then tracked from midpack two
wide and between horses, but was done early. PLEDGE set the pace along the inside of a pair of foes into the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths
pole, and was eased through the lane. LADY COMMANDER was bumped by an inner foe at the start, raced far off of the pace in the two to three path
around the turn, and never got involved.
