Footnotes
WHOSE THAT LADY settled off the pace inside, started a three wide bid into the far turn then drifted to the five path through the turn, dug in from the head
of the lane to take over later yards and was inching ahead nearing the wire. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE stalked the pace off the rail then challenged nearing the
five sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep into the far turn and contested the edge through the turn, was caught leaving the eighth pole but put CHEESE
LOUISE through the lane, then outfinished the final sixteenth, while the latter rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole
and gave up the lead past the quarter, raced close at the rail through the far turn, recovered the edge inside the eighth pole then weakened the final
sixteenth. SING FROSTY saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened stride inside the
eighth pole. LADY SPARROW raced off the pace outside leaving the first turn, bid only mildly through the backstretch and rounded the far turn about the
three path. LIL PERFECT saved ground. SHESAUPTOWNGIRL was sluggish into stride and rounded the opening turn about the five path, settled off the
pace into the backstretch then bid leaving the three eighths pole, though, faded on the far turn. BELLA FEMMINA settled off the pace about the four path,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then faded on the far turn.

Footnotes
DEAN VERDILE gave chase and took the lead at the rail leaving the turn then held on well under steady handling. UNION GRACE raced with the pace, was
carried wide on the turn but dug in from the head of the lane to duel for second later yards. SPOKANE EAGLE was hustled to the lead inside nearing the
three eighths pole, was caught while losing ground midway on the turn then outfinished in the duel for second. WIZARD OF ODDS chased the pace,
rounded the turn just off the rail then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. CAPTAIN CHARITABLE was a bit slow getting into stride then picked up the
chase toward the inside, rounded the turn near the rail and flattened stride. GOODBYESEEULATER chased the pace through the backstretch, rounded the
turn about the four path and showed little more. JAXBRADENRISHI was hustled along with the early pace two deep while between horses, but was carried
out on the turn and flattened stride from the head of the lane. GABBI'S AMOR was never a factor. ZALZA raced well back and saved ground on the turn.
ICE KAUFY gave chase outside, rounded the turn in the six and seven paths then weakened.

chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and showed little more. THORN OF ROSE HILL saved ground off the pace, bid mildly
from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the rail. ELOQUENCE raced well off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
LOVELY LADY LEXI settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and improved steadily in the three and four paths of the far turn, dug in
from the top of the stretch to get up later yards and was drawing away nearing the wire. SUPER TWENTY FIVE stalked the earlier pace and drew to even
terms at the nine sixteenths pole, took the nod into the backstretch and turned back Sherwood Lady from that point, dueled clear midway on the far turn,
dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was caught later yards. SCOTTISH DENIS saved early ground racing well off the pace, bid approaching the
three eighths pole and improved steadily at the rail on the far turn, then flattened stride the final sixteenth. FRONTIER WOMAN settled off the pace in the
two and three paths, picked up the chase from the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little further. SHERWOOD LADY rated a
slim early lead inside then caught into the backstretch, dueled at near even terms from the half mile pole but dropped back past the quarter pole, rounded
the far turn at the rail then weakened into the stretch. BIRD TRAFFIC raced in the four path the first turn, showed little response through the backstretch and
rounded the far turn about the six path. ALPINE MOON rounded the first turn about the five path, settled off the pace into the backstretch and started to fade
after a half mile. LIKE ME OR NOT settled off the pace in the three and four paths, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded in the three path
of the far turn. TUESDAY'S ROSE raced well back outside into the backstretch and showed little response.

Footnotes
FLASHY READY RICK took the lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug
in under steady encouragement to hold on well. WINNING SCHOLAR stalked the pace off the rail, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and finished
well while gaining mildly on the winner. JACOB T stalked the pace off the rail, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off
the rail and showed little more. CASTLES TRICK settled back off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole and angled to the five path on the far turn then
flattened stride. BRILLIANT IDEAS saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn but showed little further.
ALLEN JR. saved ground well back from early contention, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, but showed little more.
WHAT A STORY raced off the pace and left the first turn outside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but weakened in the six path of the far
turn. WHERE'S THE LIME and TAMAQUA were not factors. WHISKEY HUMOR stalked the earlier pace about the three path, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole then faded in the four path of the far turn.
