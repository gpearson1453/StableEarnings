stretch and was steadily handled to hold on well. THUNDERTURTLE saved ground off the pace, bid at the rail into the far turn then angled four wide
entering the stretch, but proved no stretch match through the lane. THIRD CARD DOWN saved ground off the pace, bid at the rail into the far turn eased out
in the upper stretch but showed little further. WIN THEN GRIN rounded the opening turn about the three path and settled off the pace leaving the turn,
challenged into the far turn and raced close through the turn but weakened inside the quarter pole. LA SHIRIMP rated a short lead inside, was pressured
into the far turn, gave up the lead at the rail leaving the far turn and weakened the final quarter mile. JAH GRACE raced in the three and four paths the first

Footnotes
IT'S SIZZLING TIME sprinted to a clear lead and angled to the inside to show the way then proved much the best under steady stretch handling. COUNT
THE SHELLS gave early chase off the rail and rounded the turn about the three path, dueled for second mid-stretch but was no threat to the winner. GET
LIT gave chase inside, raced near the rail on the turn then gave up second mid-stretch. PORTAL ONE chased the pace through the backstretch and
rounded the turn in the three path then raced evenly down the lane. DA CHROME chased the leaders and rounded the turn off the rail then finished evenly.
UNCLE CECIL gave only distant early chase, raced in the three and four paths of the turn and showed little further. SPANISH D'ORO gave chase and
rounded the turn off the rail then proved empty down the lane. KATIE'S NOTION chased the pace through the backstretch, rounded the turn mostly in the
three path but drifted to the seven path toward the head of the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
THE QUANTICO KID stalked the earlier pace between horses, angled five wide with a bid approaching the head of the lane then dug in under steady
encouragement to get up later yards. FORFIFTYFIVEROCKET took a quick lead to rate the pace inside, came under pressure into the turn and contested
the edge nearest the rail through the turn, dueled clear into the stretch but was caught later yards and reluctantly ceded. AUDACIOUS QUALITY stalked the
pace outside then bid in the three path of the turn, angled to the outside in the upper stretch and finished evenly. THATWOULDBEGRAND stalked the pace
then challenged and contested at a close disadvantage two deep through the turn, drifted into the stretch then flattened stride the final sixteenth. MY MAN
POTS N PANS stalked the pace inside, bid at the rail nearing the quarter pole but flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. MUHLENBERG raced well off the
pace, bid in the five path into the turn and showed little further.

STARTING TOUR rated the pace inside, raced at the rail rounding the turn and drew clear into the stretch then dug in under steady handling to hold on well.
PETION LASS settled back early on then bid off the rail into the turn, angled out in the upper stretch, dug in for second inside the sixteenth pole and finished
well. SWIRRLIE SHIRLIE stalked off the rail and kept aim in the three path rounding the turn, but flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. MAJESTIC PIC
saved ground racing well off the pace, rounded the turn near the rail and finished evenly. FOLK MAGIC stalked the pace about the three path, gave chase
four wide on the turn then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. JOYFUL NOISE was shuffled back leaving the gate then saved ground racing off the pace,
raced hemmed in through the turn, altered course three sixteenths away then flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. MARIE FROM PARIE settled off the
pace toward the outside, closed in the five path of the turn, dug in from the head of the lane but flattened stride the final furlong. LADY ROZINA was never a

chase three wide on the turn then dueled through the stretch for third. PRODIGY DOLL chased the leaders through the backstretch and rounded the turn off
the rail, then dug in from the head of the lane while ceding third in the stretch duel. SWIRLING DANCER chased the pace then bid off the rail into the turn,
angled outward toward the head of the lane and left the turn about the five path, but showed little more. DOCS SEVEN stumbled at the break then picked up
the chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little response. DONNYBROOK GIRL showed quickly in front to rate the pace
inside, was met at even terms midway on the turn then weakened toward the head of the lane. SUPREME BLESSING gave chase and rounded the turn

inside the eighth pole and raced clear through later yards. DALTON rated a slim early lead inside but was caught approaching the turn, continued a close
factor two deep through the turn, angled out to regain the lead in the upper stretch but was caught inside the eighth pole and dug in gamely from that point
before relenting later yards. LUGAMO stalked the pace early on then took the lead approaching the turn, drew clear into the turn but was caught in the
upper stretch and flattened stride inside the eighth pole. TEXAS BASIN gave chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail and finished evenly. HEIR PORT

nod. TYREEK settled off the pace outside, rallied into the turn and steadily improved in the three path, angled six wide leaving the turn and dug in for a
strong finish. WYE MUMBO engaged in close chase outside, remained in contention between horses off the rail on the turn then flattened stride inside the
sixteenth pole. TIZ AUCTION TIME pressured the pace two deep then dropped back off the rail on the turn and weakened the final quarter mile. DON
